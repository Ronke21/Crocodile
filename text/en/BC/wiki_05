<text>Anna Elisabeth Kopp (; 16 December 1936 – 7 April 2023) was a Swiss politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). She was the first woman to serve in the Swiss government, the Federal Council. She held that office from 2 October 1984 to 12 January 1989, when she resigned following a scandal over an alleged breach of official secrecy. She previously served as a member of the National Council from 1979 to 1984.

==Early life and education==
Kopp was born 16 December 1936 in Zürich, Switzerland, to Max and Beatrix (née Heberlein) Iklé. Her father was a director of the Federal Department of Finance and a member of the board of the Swiss National Bank. She hailed from textile manufacturing families from St. Gallen on both her paternal and maternal sides. Through her grandfather Adolph Iklé (1852–1923), she was of Jewish descent from Hamburg, Germany. Her second cousin, Fred Iklé, served as under secretary of defense for policy during the Reagan Administration.

She grew up in Bern with two sisters Marianne (1935–2019) and Beatrix (b. 1944). Kopp attended high school Bern before in 1956 she began to study law at the University of Zurich graduating with a Licentiate in 1960. During her studies, she joined the (SDSU) in 1956 which was founded due to the Hungarian Revolution. Except for the leadership of the SDSU was composed of students from well established families. The SDSU leadership held meetings at the Villa of Kopps parents and they also spent vacations together in an estate of the Heberlein family in Malcesine at the Lake Garda. The SDSU assisted Hungarian refugees in Switzerland and Hungary. The SDSU was dissolved in April 1957 shortly after she entered the Women Support Group of the Swiss Army and the women&#x27;s branch of the Free Democratic Party. During a student excursion to Berlin in 1959, she was presented to her future husband, Hans W. Kopp. In 1960, she completed her studies with a licentiate. The same year, she married Hans Kopp with who she moved to Zumikon. In 1963 Kopp gave birth to a daughter and until 1970, she was a housewife. 

== Political career ==

=== Cantonal and legislative offices ===
In 1970, Elisabeth Kopp became a municipal councilor (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) of Zumikon, and in 1974 the first female president of a municipality in the canton of Zurich. In February 1971, just days ahead of the national women&#x27;s suffrage referendum, she took part in a panel in the casino in Wohlen for the yes campaign. Between 1972 and 1979, she served on the executive council of the canton of Zürich as a representative for the FDP. For the FDP, Kopp was a candidate to the National Council in the Federal Elections of 1975 supported from the Women Central of Zurich and even though she was not elected, received an encouraging result. For the Federal Election of 1979, she campaigned focusing on her experience as the president of Zumikon. She would be elected with 52,113 votes. As a member of the FDP, she served in the National Council of Switzerland from 1979 to 1984. For the first seven sessions she mainly observed and only introduced one motion demanding from the Federal Council to examine the possibilities for encouraging saving. 

==== Environmental politics ====

In a press conference in 1981, shortly after it was reported that the Federal Council would leave it with the status quo and not enforce tougher measurements, she demanded that the Federal Council fulfill Kurt Furgler&#x27;s promise from 1977 to enforce tougher measurements for combustion engines in automobiles. This step was lauded by the media and she became known as an environmental politician. In fact, the press conference was organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The result was that a few days later the Federal Council decided not to impose the softer regulations and supported the installation of a catalytic converter. From 1981 onwards until her election to the Federal Council she would focus on environmental politics. She joined the Swiss League for the Protection of Nature, the predecessor of Pro Natura. In environmental politics she chose to find her political positions independently, but usually with the support from prominent figures of her party. In other political questions she followed the party line.

==== Other political positions ====
She defended nuclear energy as a clean energy, campaigned for the expansion of the airport in Zurich or opposed federal scholarships and a 42-hour week for the federal services.

=== Federal Council ===
In 1984, Federal Councillor Rudolf Friedrich resigned from his office for health reasons. The Free Democratic Party then nominated Elisabeth Kopp and Bruno Hunziker as Friedrich&#x27;s successor. 

On 2 October 1984, Kopp was elected to the Federal Council as the first woman ever in that office. She was elected with the first ballot, receiving 124 votes out of 244. As a Federal Councilor, she was the head of the Federal Department of Justice and Police (EJPD) and was elected as the vice president of the Confederation in December 1988. During her tenure, one of her focuses was the reform of the law for asylum seekers. For this she also created the post of the delegate for refugees. The reform was criticized by figures in the leftwing and christian society but it was eventually approved in a referendum in 1987. In the confirmation election of December 1987, several politicians from the green and left wing parties and the francophone part of Switzerland refused to re-elect her and she was confirmed with only 166 votes. 

=== Scandal and resignation ===
Kopp&#x27;s husband Hans W. Kopp was investigated by the authorities in Zurich over the bankruptcy of the investment company Trans K-B, of which he was the president of the board of directors. Following some pressure from the magazine &quot;Beobachter&quot;, the authorities investigated him for tax fraud. At the end of October 1989, Hans Kopp resigned from the Shakarchi Trading AG, for whom he served as the vice president of the board of directors. 

On 5 November the newspaper &quot;Tages-Anzeiger&quot; reported on an investigation into money laundering by people associated with the Shakarchi Trading AG. It reported the suspicion that Kopp received a warning from his wife, the federal councilor, which she denied. On 9 December 1988, the Swiss newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; wrote about a phone call to her husband Hans Kopp. Elisabeth Kopp then confessed having made that call, which led to the Swiss media demanding her resignation. On 12 December 1988, Kopp announced that she would resign at the end of February 1989, insisting that she was without guilt in the matter. Pressure was raised again and Kopp finally announced her immediate resignation on 12 January 1989. Her resignation led to the imposition of a , headed by Moritz Leuenberger of the Social Democratic Party (SP). The commission was tasked not only to investigate her resignation but also the approach of the EJPD towards drug traffic and tax fraud.

In February Kaspar Villiger from the FDP was elected as her successor in the Federal Council. Her successor as vice president of the Federal Council was Arnold Koller. On 27 February 1989, the National Council voted to lift her immunity. In March 1989, the state prosecutor initiated an investigation against Elisabeth Kopp for breach of confidentiality. In February 1990, the court ruled that the information in question was classified, but it could not be determined if Kopp was aware of this.

== Personal life ==
In 1960, Elisabeth Iklé married Hans W. Kopp (1931–2009), who was an attorney and board member of several companies. They had one daughter;

* Brigitt Kopp (born 1963), who is married to Res Küttel, a secondary school teacher, and has three daughters; Nicole Küttel (born 1992), Flurina Küttel (born 1993), Alina Küttel (born 2000) and two grandchildren. Brigitt Küttel is an attorney, consultant and founder of &quot;stiftung.ch&quot; which is a consulting firm for nonprofits and private foundations.

After Elisabeth Kopp was elected to the National Council, her husband bought an apartment for her in Bern. After she was elected into the Federal Council, she had to move to another apartment due to security reasons. In Zumikon, the family Kopp lived on the estate Three Oaks on which she surrounded the villa with two biotopes, endangered plants and a waterfall powered by solar power. Elisabeth Kopp died on 7 April 2023, at age 86.

<doc id="241066" wikidata="Q910044" url="?curid=241066" title="Mothball">
<text>Mothballs are small balls of chemical pesticide and deodorant, sometimes used when storing clothing and other materials susceptible to damage from silverfish, mold or moth larvae (especially clothes moths like &quot;Tineola bisselliella&quot;).

==Composition ==
Older mothballs consisted primarily of naphthalene, but due to naphthalene&#x27;s flammability, many modern mothball formulations instead use 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The latter formulation may be somewhat less flammable, although both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating for flammability. The latter chemical is also variously labeled as para-dichlorobenzene, p-dichlorobenzene, pDCB, or PDB, making it harder to identify unless all these names and initialisms are known to a potential purchaser. Both of these formulations have the strong, pungent, sickly-sweet odor often associated with mothballs. Both naphthalene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene undergo sublimation, meaning that they transition from a solid state directly into a gas; this gas is toxic to moths and moth larvae.

Due to the health risks of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and flammability of naphthalene, other substances like camphor are sometimes used.

==Uses==
Mothballs are stored in air-tight bags made of a non-reactive plastic such as polyethylene or polypropylene (other plastics may be degraded or softened). The clothing to be protected should be sealed within airtight containers; otherwise the vapors will tend to escape into the surrounding environment. Manufacturer&#x27;s instructions regularly warn against using mothballs for any purpose other than those specified by the packaging, as such uses are not only harmful and noxious, they are also frequently considered illegal.

Although occasionally used as snake repellent, mothball use as a rodent, squirrel, or bat repellent is illegal in many areas, and tends to cause more annoyance and hazard to humans than to the target pest. However, mothballs continue to be advertised as squirrel repellent and are an ingredient in some commercial vermin and snake repellent products.

==Health risks==
The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that 1,4-dichlorobenzene &quot;may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen&quot;. This has been indicated by animal studies, although a full-scale human study has not been done. The National Toxicology Program (NTP), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the state of California consider 1,4-dichlorobenzene a carcinogen.

Exposure to naphthalene mothballs can cause acute hemolysis (anemia) in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. IARC classifies naphthalene as possibly carcinogenic to humans and other animals (see also Group 2B). IARC points out that acute exposure causes cataracts in humans, rats, rabbits, and mice. Chronic exposure to naphthalene vapors is reported to also cause cataracts and retinal hemorrhage. Under California&#x27;s Proposition 65, naphthalene is listed as &quot;known to the State to cause cancer&quot;.

Research at the University of Colorado at Boulder revealed a probable mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of mothballs and some types of air fresheners.

In addition to their cancer risks, mothballs are known to cause liver and kidney damage.

1,4-Dichlorobenzene is a neurotoxin. It has been abused as an inhalant, causing a variety of neurotoxic effects.

Mothballs containing naphthalene have been banned within the EU since 2008.

==Alternatives==
As discussed in more detail at &quot;Tineola bisselliella&quot;, alternatives to mothballs to control clothes moths include dry cleaning, freezing, thorough vacuuming, and washing in hot water. Camphor is also used as a moth repellent, particularly in China. Unlike naphthalene and dichlorobenzene, camphor has medicinal applications and is not regarded as a carcinogen, though it is toxic in large doses. Red cedar wood and oil is also used as an alternative moth repellent.

Pheromone traps are also an effective diagnostic tool and can sometimes be an effective control tool to protect valuable clothing.

==In popular culture==
As a verb, &quot;mothball&quot; has a metaphorical usage, meaning &quot;to stop work on an idea, plan, or job, but leaving it in such a way that work can continue in the future&quot;. &quot;Mothballed&quot; is a common adjective to describe ships and aircraft stored for long periods, but not sent for scrapping.

The origins of this use of &quot;mothballed&quot; may have been reports that the ocean liner SS Normandie was &quot;packed in mothballs&quot; when in September 1939 it was &#x27;interned&#x27; by the U.S. Government in New York. The papers reported a month later that &quot;fourteen huge barrels of mothballs had been used to preserve carpets, draperies, and upholstery&quot;. The ship was at the time expected to remain in New York for the duration of the war, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor, she was converted to a troop ship.

The U.S. Navy planned to store fighting ships in 1945, but keep them ready for rapid return to service. By 1946 these ships were referred to as being &quot;mothballed&quot;. The process however did not mention mothballs, but rust preventative coating, sealing compartments, removing equipment, and covering topside equipment, as well as protecting the hull. Mothballed ships were expected to be able to resume active service in just 10 days. United States Navy reserve fleets are still informally referred to as the &#x27;mothball fleet&#x27;.

<text>Seton Hall University (SHU) is a private Roman Catholic research university in South Orange, New Jersey, United States. Founded in 1856 by then-Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley and named after his aunt, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, Seton Hall is the oldest diocesan university in the United States.

Seton Hall consists of 9 schools and colleges and has an undergraduate enrollment of about 5,800 students and a graduate enrollment of about 4,400. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

The university is known for its men&#x27;s basketball team, which has appeared in 13 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournaments after making it to the final of the 1989 tournament and losing 80–79 in overtime to the Michigan Wolverines. The resulting increase in national television exposure has led to increasing numbers of applications from prospective students.

==History==
===Early history===

Like many Catholic universities in the United States, Seton Hall arose out of the Council of Baltimore, held in Maryland in 1844, with the goal of bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith. The Diocese of Newark had been established by Pope Pius IX in 1853, just three years before the founding of the college, and it necessitated an institution for higher learning. Seton Hall College was formally founded on September 1, 1856, by Newark Bishop James Roosevelt Bayley, a first cousin of James Roosevelt I, father of president Franklin Roosevelt. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was later named the first American-born Catholic saint.

The main campus was originally in Madison, New Jersey. Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid served as the first college president (1856–1857, 1859–1868) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young, vice-president; Reverend Daniel Fisher (the second college president, 1857–1859) and five lay instructors. Initially, Seton Hall had only five students – Leo G. Thebaud, Louis and Alfred Boisaubin, Peter Meehan, and John Moore. By the end of the first year, the student body had grown more than tenfold to 60. The college moved to its current location in 1860.
By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was continuing its rapid growth and began to enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange fires in the university&#x27;s history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the college&#x27;s first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the university&#x27;s main building. In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom as well as several dormitory buildings in 1909.

During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight times, and the American Civil War, the college continued to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) during the summer of 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall&#x27;s preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated.

James F. Kelley, then 33 years old, was appointed by Thomas J. Walsh of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark to serve as president of Seton Hall College in July 1936, making him the nation&#x27;s youngest college president. When he took office, Kelley led a liberal arts school that had an enrollment of 300. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM. The construction of the Walsh Gymnasium began as part of a project initiated in 1939 that would cost $600,000 (equivalent to $ million in ).

Kelley stepped down from office at Seton Hall in March 1949 in the wake of an investigation into the by the school by the federal government that looked into potential improper sales of war surplus equipment that had been given for the school&#x27;s use. He was succeeded by John L. McNulty. Enrollment at the school had grown to 6,000 by the time Kelley left office.
The college was organized into a university in 1950 following the unprecedented growth in enrollment. The College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business, nursing, and education comprised the university; the School of Law opened its doors in 1951, with Miriam Rooney as the first woman dean of law in the United States.

===College of Medicine and Dentistry===
The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was established in 1954 as the first medical school and dental school in New Jersey. It was located in Jersey City, adjacent to the Jersey City Medical Center, which was used for clinical education. Although the college, set up under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Newark, was a separate legal entity from the university, it had an interlocking board of trustees. The first class was enrolled in 1956 and graduated in 1960. The dental school also awarded its first degrees in 1960. From 1960 to 1964, 348 individuals received an M.D. degree. The college was sold to the state of New Jersey in 1965 for $4 million after the archdiocese could not support mounting school debt and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (which became the New Jersey Medical School, part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). That entity became part of the Rutgers University system in 2013 and now exists as the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. Seton Hall established a new School of Medicine in partnership with Hackensack University Health Network in 2015; however, in 2020, the medical school formally separated from Seton Hall becoming the independent Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.

===Modernization period===
Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing in the next two decades, the university saw the construction and modernization of a large number of facilities and the construction including the library, science building, residence halls, and the university center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.

The 1970s and 1980s continued to be a time of growth and renewal. New business and nursing classroom buildings and an art center were opened. In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of Mahwah centered on a grand mansion and estate). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 and 1988 and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the university made significant changes to account for a larger number of student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for about 2100 students. 

The physical development of the campus continued in the 1990s. The $20 million Walsh Library opened in 1994, and its first-class study and research resources marked the beginning of a technological transformation of Seton Hall (current university library holdings are over 500,000 volumes). The university dedicated its newest academic center in 1997, originally named Kozlowski Hall for Dennis Kozlowski, former CEO of Tyco International. It was renamed Jubilee Hall following Kozlowski&#x27;s criminal conviction in 2005. Its recreation center was originally named after Robert Brennan, but he was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. It has since been renamed for athletic director Richie Regan.

===Boland Hall fire===

On January 19, 2000, an arson fire killed three and injured 54 students in Boland Hall, a freshman residence hall on the campus in South Orange. The incident, one of the deadliest in recent US history, occurred at 4:30 am, when most students were asleep. After a three-and-a-half-year investigation, a 60-count indictment charged two freshmen students, Sean Ryan and Joseph LePore, with starting the fire and felony murder for the deaths that resulted. LePore and Ryan pleaded guilty to third-degree arson and were sentenced to five years in a youth correctional facility with eligibility for parole 16 months after the start of their prison terms. Consequently, the student body dedicated an area in front of Boland Hall to those that suffered from the fire called &quot;The Remember Seal&quot; and stronger university fire safety precautions were instituted.

===Sesquicentennial===
On the 150th anniversary (1856–2006) of the university&#x27;s founding, Seton Hall initiated the Ever Forward capital campaign to raise a total of $150 million. The campaign was the most prestigious building campaign in the university&#x27;s long history. The funds were directed to many areas throughout the university, however a majority went toward building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites.

In fall 2007, the university opened the new $35 million Science and Technology Center, completing one of the major campaign priorities ahead of schedule. On December 17, 2007, the university announced that the campaign&#x27;s fund raising goals had been met and exceeded more than two weeks ahead of the campaign&#x27;s scheduled closing date.

=== 2010–present ===

 On April 30, 2010, the archbishop John J. Myers expressed concern about a planned offering of a course on same-sex marriage at Seton Hall University, saying it &quot;troubles me greatly&quot;.

The university has completed a host of campus renovations and new construction while attracting more students. An initial round of improvements totaling nearly $100 million concluded in 2014 with the opening of a new fitness center, academic building, parking garage, and an expansion of the Aquinas Hall dormitory. A second round of construction is planned for 2016 and beyond, which will add the Visitors Hall.

Seton Hall announced the formation of two additional academic units in 2015 – the School of Medicine and the College of Communication and the Arts. The medical school was established in partnership with Hackensack Meridian Health, welcoming its first class in 2018. In 2020, the School of Medicine became the first independent medical school operating under Hackensack Meridian Health. The College of Communication and the Arts was a department in the College of Arts and Sciences before being elevated in the summer of 2015.

The university announced in December 2022 that employees in the law school had embezzled nearly $1 million. The school&#x27;s dean resigned a month before this announcement. The following year, university president Joseph Nyre resigned in the wake of ongoing conflicts with the university&#x27;s board of regents about the governance of the law school.

==Governance==
The university, legally incorporated as &quot;Seton Hall University, an educational corporation of New Jersey&quot;, is governed by a 16-member board of trustees. Eleven members of the board serve on it as a virtue of their positions within the university or Archdiocese of Newark. The Archbishop of Newark, who serves as the president of the board, retains the power to appoint the remaining five members of the body. Appointed members of the board serve three-year terms, until their respective successor is appointed. The board of trustees exclusively maintains the property rights of the university and provides selection of title, scope, and location of the schools and colleges of the university.

The governance of the university includes a board of regents, which is charged with the management of the university. The board has a membership of between 25 and 39 members. Six of the members are ex-officio; the board of trustees maintains the right to elect up to thirty more. Regents maintain the exclusive hiring authority over the president of the university. Previous by-laws of the university stipulated that the president must be a Roman Catholic priest.

==Campus==

===Main campus===
The main campus of Seton Hall University is situated on of suburban land on South Orange Avenue. It is home to nine of the 10 schools and colleges of the university. The South Orange Village center is just a west of the main campus. Directly across from the main campus to the northwest are scenic Montrose Park and the Montrose Park Historic District, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The Eugene V. Kelly Carriage House, on the campus itself, is also NRHP-listed. The village itself dates back to 1666 preceding the establishment of Seton Hall College. Also since the beginning of the college, the South Orange Rail Station has served as an integral means to campus commuters. The main campus combines architectural styles including Roman, neo-Gothic and modern. The South Orange campus became a gated community during the university&#x27;s Modernization Period.

===Buildings===

The original centerpieces of the campus were made up of three buildings built in the 19th century. Presidents, Stafford and Marshall Halls were built when the college moved from Madison to South Orange. Some of the more notable buildings on campus are:

* Presidents Hall – One of the oldest buildings on campus and a flagship of the university, Presidents Hall was completed in 1867. Located at the epicenter of the main campus, Presidents Hall is a neo-Gothic structure dressed in brownstone. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the university&#x27;s administration including the Office of the University President. The halls are lined with portraits of past University presidents and include a large stained glass depicting Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, which was commissioned in 1866 by President Bayley.
* Chapel of the Immaculate Conception – The handsome Gothic Revival brownstone building was designed by architect Jeremiah O&#x27;Rourke, who later designed the Cathedral of Newark. The chapel was built in 1863 and dedicated in 1870. Major renovations were completed in 1972 and most recently in 2008. The 2008 renovation was a primary component of Seton Hall&#x27;s comprehensive Ever Forward fundraising campaign. In 2013, the chapel landed at No. 24 on Buzzfeed&#x27;s survey of &quot;31 Insanely Beautiful Colleges You Can Get Married At&quot; and was ranked at No. 28 the following year on Collegeranker&#x27;s list of &quot;The 50 Most Beautiful College Campus Wedding Venues.
* Muscarelle Hall (formerly Stafford Hall) – In 2021, Stafford Hall was renamed to Muscarelle Hall after Sharon and Joseph L. Muscarelle Jr. The new academic building rose on the site of the former Stafford Hall in 2014. The outdated structure had been a campus fixture since the 19th century. Bearing the name of its predecessor, the new Stafford Hall features 12 classrooms of multiple sizes, nine of which can accommodate 35 students each, while the remaining rooms include two large classrooms that can hold 70 and 50 students apiece and one smaller room for 25 students.
* McQuaid Hall – Built around 1900, it was named for Bishop Bernard J. McQuaid, Seton Hall&#x27;s first president from 1856 to 1857 and 1859 to 1867. McQuaid Hall was both a boarding house for students and a convent for nuns before serving its present purpose as the home of the School of Diplomacy and International Relations as well as the Seton Hall University School of Health and Medical Sciences.

* Jubilee Hall houses the W. Paul Stillman School of Business in addition to the largest auditorium at the university. There are several computer labs, state-of-the-art classrooms and a Stock Exchange research room. The building was originally named Kozlowski Hall after Dennis Kozlowski, Seton Hall Alumni and former CEO of Tyco International. Following Kozlowski&#x27;s conviction for securities fraud the building was renamed at his request to Jubilee Hall in honor of the Papal Jubilee. Built in 1997, it is one of the newer additions to the main campus.
*Walsh Gymnasium is a multi-purpose arena for University Sports. The arena opened in 1939 and can seat 2,600 people. It was home to the Seton Hall University Pirates men&#x27;s basketball team before they moved to Continental Airlines Arena and then the Prudential Center. Currently, the arena hosts the women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams, and is part of the Richie Regan Recreation and Athletic Center. The building, like the school&#x27;s main library, is named for Thomas J. Walsh, Fifth Bishop of Newark and former president of the board of trustees.

* The Science and Technology Center (formerly McNulty Hall) – The building was originally named for Msgr. John L. McNulty, president of the university from 1949 to 1959, McNulty Hall was built as the university&#x27;s technology and research center in 1954. One of the most famous features of the building is the &quot;Atom Wall&quot;, a relief artwork originally located on outer façade. Following renovations completed in the summer of 2007, the &quot;Atom Wall&quot;, depicting the gift of scientific knowledge from God to man, can be seen in the glass atrium of the building. McNulty also houses a large amphitheater and observatory for the chemistry, physics and biology departments.
* Fahy Hall – Built in 1968, the building houses the classrooms and faculty offices of the College of Arts and Sciences. The building was named after Monsignor Thomas George Fahy who served as president of the university from 1970 to 1976. Fahy Hall includes several student resources and facilities, including two television studios, two amphitheaters and laboratories for computing, language learning, and statistics.
* Arts and Sciences Hall and The Nursing Building – Originally built to house the Stillman School of Business in 1973, with the creation of Jubilee Hall in 1997, the building is now home to the College of Arts and Sciences in the West wing and the Caroline D. Schwartz College of Nursing in the East Wing. The College of Nursing has advanced teaching facilities including hospital beds, demonstration rooms and multi-purpose practice areas.
*Bethany Hall – The most recent addition to the campus, Bethany Hall, also known as the Welcome Center, opened in February 2018. It has event space that can hold 500–700 people and holds admissions offices.

===Sustainability===
Seton Hall&#x27;s extensive recycling program is one of the highlights in the college&#x27;s sustainability programming. Recycling is sometimes mandatory on campus as per New Jersey state laws. Additionally, Seton Hall celebrated Earth Day 2010, marking the event with demonstrations about composting and rainwater collection, a group hike, and an outdoor screening of the environmental documentary &quot;HOME&quot;.

On the College Sustainability Report Card 2011, Seton Hall earned a grade of &quot;B−&quot;. Lack of endowment transparency and green building initiatives hurt the grade, while the recycling programs were a plus.

===Newark Campus===

A satellite of the main campus, the Newark Campus is home to the university&#x27;s School of Law. Located at One Newark Center, the Law School and several academic centers of the university are housed in a modern 22-story skyscraper building. It is at the corner of Raymond Boulevard and McCarter Highway in the business and high-tech heart of downtown Newark, New Jersey and was completed in 1991. The Newark Campus building provides and an additional of library to the university.

The Seton Hall University School of Law was founded in 1951. It is accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA) since 1951 and is also a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). Seton Hall is one of two law schools in the state of New Jersey. Seton Hall Law was founded by a woman, Miriam T. Rooney, who served as dean from 1951 to 1961. She was not only Seton Hall&#x27;s first female dean, but was the first woman dean at an ABA-accredited law school in the United States. Dean Kathleen M. Boozang, who assumed the role in July 2015, is the third woman dean of Seton Hall Law.

=== Traditions ===

==== University seal ====
The university seal combines attributes from the Bayley coat of arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal &quot;Hazard Zet Forward&quot; (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning &quot;at whatever risk, yet go forward&quot;. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal in the middle of the university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate on time.

==== Alma mater ====
The &quot;Seton Hall University Alma Mater&quot; was adopted as the official song of Seton Hall University. Charles A. Byrne of the class of 1937 wrote the original lyrics in 1936 and the university adopted the alma mater during the 1937 school year when the dean first read it to the student body. Some students participate in the tradition of saying &quot;blue and white&quot; more loudly than the rest of the alma mater.

==Athletics==
 
The school&#x27;s sports teams are called the Pirates. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I and in the Big East Conference. The college established its first basketball squad in 1903.

Seton Hall athletics is best known for its men&#x27;s basketball program, which won the 1953 National Invitation Tournament (NIT); were the 1989 NCAA tournament national runners-up following a defeat to Michigan in the final, 80–79 in overtime; and are New Jersey&#x27;s most successful representative during March Madness by number of wins. Seton Hall also fields varsity teams in baseball, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country running, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving, women&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s volleyball.

Seton Hall also has club programs participating in ice hockey, rugby union, lacrosse, and men&#x27;s volleyball and soccer. All Seton Hall sports have their home field on the South Orange campus except for the men&#x27;s basketball team which currently plays at the Prudential Center in Newark after previously calling the Meadowlands home, and the club ice hockey team which plays at Richard J. Codey Arena in West Orange.

Seton Hall fielded its first varsity football program from 1882 until cancellation in 1932. The university later fielded a club football team from 1965 through 1972. In 1972, the football team won a national club championship. The next year, 1973, it was reinstated as a varsity program competing at the Division III level as the university aligned its other varsity teams with the original Big East Conference in 1979. Football was ultimately canceled in permanence after the 1981 season. During this final period of varsity football sponsorship, the team was coached by Ed Manigan.

<doc id="241073" wikidata="Q2629164" url="?curid=241073" title="Internet Speculative Fiction Database">
<text>The Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB) is a database of bibliographic information on genres considered speculative fiction, including science fiction and related genres such as fantasy, alternate history, and horror fiction. The ISFDB is a volunteer effort, with the database being open for moderated editing and user contributions, and a wiki that allows the database editors to coordinate with each other. the site had catalogued 2,002,324 story titles from 232,816 authors.

The code for the site has been used in books and tutorials as examples of database schema and organizing content. The ISFDB database and code are available under Creative Commons licensing. The site won the Wooden Rocket Award in the Best Directory Site category in 2005.

== Purpose ==
The ISFDB database indexes speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, horror, and alternate history) authors, novels, short fiction, essays, publishers, awards, and magazines in print, electronic, and audio formats. It supports author pseudonyms, series, and cover art plus interior illustration credits, which are combined into integrated author, artist, and publisher bibliographies with brief biographical data. An ongoing effort is verification of publication contents and secondary bibliographic sources against the database, with the goals being data accuracy and to improve the coverage of speculative fiction to 100 percent.

== History ==
Several speculative fiction author bibliographies were posted to the USENET newsgroup rec.arts.sf.written from 1984 to 1994 by Jerry Boyajian, Gregory J. E. Rawlins and John Wenn. A more or less standard bibliographic format was developed for these postings. Many of these bibliographies can still be found at The Linköping Science Fiction Archive. In 1993, a searchable database of awards information was developed by Al von Ruff. In 1994, John R. R. Leavitt created the Speculative Fiction Clearing House (SFCH). In late 1994, he asked for help in displaying awards information, and von Ruff offered his database tools. Leavitt declined, because he wanted code that could interact with other aspects of the site. In 1995, Al von Ruff and &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; (a prolific contributor to rec.arts.sf.written) started to construct the ISFDB, based on experience with the SFCH and the bibliographic format finalized by John Wenn. The first version of ISFDB went live on 8 September 1995, and a URL was published in January 1996.

The ISFDB was first located at an ISP in Champaign Illinois, but it suffered from constrained resources in disk space and database support, which limited its growth. In October 1997 the ISFDB moved to SF Site, a major SF portal and review site. Due to the rising costs of remaining with SF Site, the ISFDB moved to its own domain in December 2002, but it was shut down by the hosting ISP due to high resource usage. In February 2003, it began to be hosted by The Cushing Library Science Fiction and Fantasy Research Collection and Institute for Scientific Computation at Texas A&amp;M University. The ISFDB moved to a commercial hosting service in 2008.

On 27 February 2005, the database and the underlying code became available under Creative Commons licensing.

ISFDB was originally edited by a limited number of people, principally Al von Ruff and Ahasuerus. Editing was opened in 2006 to the general public on an open content basis, with changed content being approved by one of a limited number of moderators in an attempt to protect the accuracy of the database.

In late 2022, the ISFDB faced public criticism for refusing to update its entry for the transgender author Lee Mandelo to reflect his new name. The update was finally made after more than a year of repeated requests.

==Awards and reception==
In 1998, Cory Doctorow wrote in &quot;Science Fiction Age&quot; that &quot;[T]he best all-round guide to things science-fictional remains the Internet Speculative Fiction Database&quot;. In April 2009, Zenkat wrote that &quot;it is widely considered one of the most authoritative sources about Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror literature available on the Internet&quot;. ISFDB was the winner of the 2005 Wooden Rocket Award in the &quot;Best Directory Site&quot; category.

Ken Irwin reviewed the site for &quot;Reference Reviews&quot; in 2006, praising &quot;the scalable level of detail available for particular authors and titles&quot; while also pointing out &quot;usability improvements&quot; needed at that time. He concludes by calling it &quot;a tremendous asset to researchers and fans of speculative fiction&quot;, stating that no other online bibliographies have &quot;the breadth, depth, and sophistication of this database&quot;. On Tor.com, James Davis Nicoll described the site as &quot;the single best [SFF] bibliographical resource there is&quot;. Gabriel McKee, author of &quot;The Gospel According to Science Fiction&quot;, described the site as an &quot;indispensable [source] of information in putting this project together&quot;, and the site was described as &quot;invaluable&quot; by Andrew Milner and J. R. Burgmann in their book, &quot;Science Fiction and Climate Change&quot;. The Chicon 8 committee gave a special committee award to ISFDB during their opening ceremonies on 1 September 2022.

As a real-world example of a non-trivial database, the schema and MySQL files from ISFDB have been used in a number of tutorials. Schema and data from the site were used throughout Chapter 9 of the book &quot;Rails for Java Developers&quot;. It was also used in a series of tutorials by Lucid Imagination on Solr, an enterprise search platform.

, Quantcast estimates that ISFDB is visited by over 67,400 people monthly. The database, , contains 2,319,391 unique story titles from 273,511 authors.

<text>The Greenwich Time Signal (GTS), popularly known as the pips, is a series of six short tones (or &quot;pips&quot;) broadcast at one-second intervals by many BBC Radio stations to mark the precise start of each hour. The pips were introduced in 1924, generated by the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and from 1990 were generated by the BBC in London. The broadcast pips replaced an electrical time coordination system based on the railway telegraph network, which itself was an extension of the mechanical time balls in Portsmouth (1829) and later Greenwich (1833), which enabled navigators aboard ships moored in those places to set their chronometers for the determination of longitude on voyages.

==Structure==

There are six pips (short beeps) in total, which occur on each of the 5 seconds leading up to the hour and on the hour itself. Each pip is a 1 kHz tone (about a fifth of a semitone above musical B5) the first five of which last a tenth of a second each, while the final pip lasts half a second. The actual moment when the hour changes – the &quot;on-time marker&quot; – is at the very beginning of the last pip.

When a leap second occurs (exactly one second before midnight UTC), it is indicated by a seventh pip. In this case the first pip occurs at 23:59:55 (as usual) and there is a sixth short pip at 23:59:60 (the leap second) followed by the long pip at 00:00:00. The possibility of an extra pip for the leap second thus justifies the final pip being longer than the others, so that it is always clear which pip is on the hour. Before leap seconds were conceived in 1972, the final pip was the same length as the others. Although &quot;negative&quot; leap seconds can also be used to make the year shorter, this has never happened in practice.

Although normally broadcast only on the hour by BBC domestic radio, BBC World Service uses the signal at other times as well. The signal is generated at each quarter-hour and has on occasion been broadcast in error.

==Usage==
The pips are available to BBC radio stations every fifteen minutes, but, except in rare cases, they are only broadcast on the hour, usually before news bulletins or news programmes. Normally, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the pips every hour except at 18:00 and 00:00 (at the start of the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Midnight News&quot; respectively), and at 22:00 on Sundays (at the start of the &quot;Westminster Hour&quot;) when they are replaced by the striking of Big Ben at the Palace of Westminster. On BBC Radio 2, the pips are used at 07:00, 08:00 and 17:00 on weekdays, at 07:00 and 08:00 on Saturdays and at 08:00 and 09:00 on Sundays.

The pips were used on BBC Radio 1 during &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; at 06:30 just after the news, 09:00 as part of the &quot;Tedious Link&quot; feature, 10:00 (at the end of the show) and often before &quot;Newsbeat&quot;. As most stations only air the pips on the hour, &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; was the only show where the pips were broadcast on the half-hour. Chris Moyles continues to use the pips at the beginning of his show on Radio X. The pips were previously used at 19:00 on Saturday evenings at the start of Radio 1&#x27;s 12-hour simulcast with digital station BBC Radio 1Xtra. The pips were also used on Radio 6 Music for a rare occurrence. It took place between 2009 and 2011 on weekdays and the pips were played at 10:00 (end of the breakfast show) and at 19:00 (end of the drive show). On Remembrance Day and Remembrance Sunday, Radio 4 uses the pips at 10:59:55 to mark the start of the two minutes silence and again at 11:01:55 to mark the end.

BBC Radio 5 Live broadcast the pips at 06:00 between 2000 and 2008.

BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 5 Live does not broadcast the pips.

The BBC World Service broadcasts the pips every hour.

Pips were also heard on many BBC Local Radio stations until the introduction of a new presentation package in 2020. A rare quarter-hour Greenwich Time Signal was heard at 05:15 weekdays on Wally Webb&#x27;s programme on local radio in the east of England until it ended in March 2020, as part of his &quot;synchronised cup of tea&quot; feature.

In 1999, pip-like sounds were incorporated into the themes written by composer David Lowe to introduce BBC Television News programmes. They are still used today on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC World News and BBC News.

The BBC does not allow the pips to be broadcast except as a time signal. Radio plays and comedies which have fictional news programmes use various methods to avoid playing the full six pips, ranging from simply fading in the pips to a version played on &quot;On the Hour&quot; in which the sound was made into a small tune between the pips. &quot;The News Quiz&quot; also featured a special Christmas pantomime edition where the pips went &quot;missing&quot;, and the problem was avoided there by only playing individual pips. The 2012 project &quot;Radio Reunited&quot; used the pips to commemorate 90 years of BBC Radio.

==Accuracy==
The pips for national radio stations and some local radio stations are timed relative to UTC, from an atomic clock in the basement of Broadcasting House synchronised with the National Physical Laboratory&#x27;s Time from NPL and GPS. On other stations, the pips are generated locally from a GPS-synchronised clock. The broadcast pips usefulness for time calibration is diminished by the time lags involved in digital broadcasting.

The BBC compensates for the time delay in both broadcasting and receiving equipment, as well as the time for the actual transmission. The pips are timed so that they are accurately received on long wave as far as from the Droitwich AM transmitter, which is the distance to Central London.

As a pre-digital time transfer and transmission system, the pips have been a great technological success. In modern times, however, time can be transferred using IRIG and pre-NTP.

Newer digital broadcasting methods have introduced even greater problems for the accuracy of use of the pips. On digital platforms such as DVB, DAB, satellite and the Internet, the pips — although generated accurately — are not heard by the listener exactly on the hour. The encoding and decoding of the digital signal causes a delay, of usually between two and eight seconds. In the case of satellite broadcasting, the travel time of the signal to and from the satellite adds about another 0.25 seconds.

==History==

The pips have been broadcast daily since 5 February 1924,
and were the idea of the Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Watson Dyson, and the head of the BBC, John Reith who commissioned Marconi / Siemens in Charlton, close to Greenwich, to create the signal. The company gave the project to an 18-year-old engineer, Harry Lampen Edwards, who was seconded to the Observatory. The pips were originally controlled by two mechanical clocks located in the Royal Greenwich Observatory that had electrical contacts attached to their pendula. Two clocks were used in case of a breakdown of one. These sent a signal each second to the BBC, which converted them to the audible oscillatory tone broadcast.

The Royal Greenwich Observatory moved to Herstmonceux Castle in 1957 and the GTS equipment followed a few years later in the form of an electronic clock. Reliability was improved by renting two lines for the service between Herstmonceux and the BBC, with a changeover between the two at Broadcasting House if the main line became disconnected.

The tone sent on the lines was inverted: the signal sent to the BBC was a steady 1 kHz tone when no pip was required, and no tone when a pip should be sounded. This let faults on the line be detected immediately by automated monitoring for loss of audio.

The Greenwich Time Signal was the first sound heard in the handover to the London 2012 Olympics during the Beijing 2008 Olympics closing ceremony.

The pips were also broadcast by the BBC Television Service, but this practice was discontinued by the 1960s.

To celebrate the 90th birthday of the pips on 5 February 2014, the &quot;Today&quot; programme broadcast a sequence that included a re-working of the Happy Birthday melody using the GTS as its base sound.

==Crashing the pips==
The BBC discourages any other sound being broadcast at the same time as the pips; doing so is commonly known as &quot;crashing the pips&quot;. This was most often referred to on Terry Wogan&#x27;s Radio 2 Breakfast show, although usually only in jest since the actual event happened rarely. Different BBC Radio stations approach this issue differently. Radio 1 and Radio 2 generally take a relaxed approach with the pips, usually playing them over the closing seconds of a song or a jingle &quot;bed&quot; (background music from a jingle), followed by their respective news jingles. Many BBC local radio stations also played the pips over the station&#x27;s jingle before the 2020 rebrand. BBC Radio 4 is stricter, as it is an almost entirely speech-based network.

As a contribution to Comic Relief&#x27;s 2005 Red Nose Day, the BBC developed a &quot;pips&quot; ringtone which could be downloaded.

Bill Bailey&#x27;s BBC Rave includes the BBC News theme, which incorporates a variant of the pips (though not actually broadcast exactly on the hour). The footage can be seen on his DVD &quot;Part Troll&quot;.

In the late 1980s Radio 1 featured the pips played over a station jingle during Jakki Brambles&#x27; early show and Simon Mayo&#x27;s breakfast show. This was not strictly &quot;crashing the pips&quot; as they were not intended to be used as an accurate time signal.

During her final broadcast as presenter on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s The Today Programme – following 11 years sharing the post – Mishal Husain asked for forgiveness having previously &quot;crashed the pips.&quot; Husain remarked that &quot;in the tradition of [her] faith, when people used to go on pilgrimage in generations past, they would not only take leave of their associates, but they would ask for their forgiveness because in those days many would not return from the arduous journey.&quot;

==Technical problems==
At 8 am on 17 September 2008, to the surprise of John Humphrys, the day&#x27;s main presenter on the &quot;Today&quot; programme, and Johnnie Walker, who was standing in for Terry Wogan on Radio 2, the pips went &quot;adrift&quot; by six seconds, and broadcast seven pips rather than six. This was traced to a problem with the pip generator, which was rectified by switching it off and on again. Part of Humphrys&#x27; surprise was probably because of his deliberate avoidance of crashing the pips with the help of an accurate clock in the studio.

A sudden total failure in the generation of the audio pulses that constitute the pips was experienced on 31 May 2011 and silence was unexpectedly broadcast in place of the 17:00 signal. The problem was traced to the power supply of the equipment which converts the signal from the atomic clocks into an audible signal. Whilst repairs were underway the BBC elected to broadcast a &quot;dignified silence&quot; in place of the pips at 19:00. By 19:45 the same day the power supply was repaired and the 20:00 pips were broadcast as normal.

== Similar time signals elsewhere ==

Many radio broadcasters around the world use the Greenwich Time Signal, or a variant thereof, as a means to mark the start of the hour. The pips are used in both domestic and international commercial and public broadcasting. Many radio stations use six tones similar to those used by the BBC World Service; some shorten it to five, four, or three tones. On some broadcasters the final pip is of a different pitch.
* Australia – Pips are used on ABC Radio National and ABC Local Radio at the top of every hour, as well as on Fairfax Media talkback stations- 2UE, 3AW, 4BC and 6PR. In Australia, the news pips are closer to 735 Hz and each of the six pips lasts for half a second. After each pip, there is half a second of silence. The pips were discontinued on ABC Radio Sydney on 23 November 2023 to coincide with the station&#x27;s 100th anniversary. 
* Brazil - Some news stations, such as the national station Radio Bandeirantes, and the regional stations Radio Guaíba and Radio Gaúcha broadcasts a similar time signal every 15 minutes. In Radio Bandeirantes, there is 5-pips signal (called as &quot;fifth signal&quot;), broadcast every 15 minutes. In Radio Gaúcha, a four-pip signal with three tones in 920 Hz and the last in 1360 Hz is broadcast every 15 minutes. The musical radio network Atlântida FM, which broadcasts to the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina transmits an audible signal every 15 minutes, composed by the first four notes of the song &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.
* Bulgaria - On all BNR radio stations, the pips are broadcast on the hour. Five short pips and a long pip is broadcast between :55 and :00. The time signal broadcast at 15:00 EET is from Bulgarian Institute of Metrology.
* Canada – The National Research Council Time Signal was broadcast daily on Ici Radio-Canada Première at 12:00 EST/EDT and on CBC Radio One at 13:00 EST/EDT. It was Canada&#x27;s longest running radio feature and had been broadcast every day from 5 November 1939 until 10 October 2023.
* Egypt - Nile FM broadcasts pips similar to the BBC on the hour at 07:00hrs daily at the start of the Big Breakfast show with Rob Stevens and Nadine. 
* Finland – On Yle&#x27;s radio services the pips are broadcast on the hour.
* Hong Kong – A six-pip time signal is used on RTHK&#x27;s radio channels. The signals, which are provided by the Hong Kong Observatory, are broadcast every half-hour during the day and on the hour at night, immediately before the news headline reports.
* Israel – On Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation hourly radio news, five tones (part of a recording of Kol Israel&#x27;s original beeps) play counting down to the hour. Right as the hour starts, a jingle starts playing, the end of which includes the IPBC&#x27;s sonic ident and an a cappella singing the name of the broadcaster &quot;Kan&quot;. This jingle replaced the original six tones that played on Kol Israel&#x27;s hourly newscasts, with the sixth tone being longer. As of 2017 (when public broadcaster IBA got shut down and replaced by the IPBC or &quot;Kan&quot;), the intro got changed and added a jingle. In 2023, this jingle was replaced with a new one. This jingle is played twice, before the headlines, which are now read at 30 seconds to the hour, and then immediately following. The second iteration includes the tones counting down to the hour, which were left as a &quot;memorial to the historical soundtrack&quot;.
* Japan – NHK Television formerly used three short pips played at :57 to :59 of the clock ident and a longer three-second pip from :00 to :03 just before the start of news programmes. The longer three-second pip can however be crashed shortly after the :00 mark on certain special events or if there was time constraints.
* Netherlands – In the NPO (Netherlands Public Broadcasting), the signals have been around since 1948, when six pips were used. In 1991 they went down to three. Broadcast of the traditional pips stopped with the last transmission at 7:00 on 2 October 2018, leading way to a new design with three pips that count down to exactly the full hour and make way for a short tune. Other radio stations may still use the traditional beeps at every hour.
* New Zealand – RNZ National plays the six pips at the top of every hour. Additionally, a bird call is played before the 7:00 and 9:00 news on Morning Report.
* Russia - Russia&#x27;s state radio channels broadcast six tones (five little pips and one short beep). The duration of the sixth pip depends on the current hour: it is 100 ms at midnight Moscow time (UTC+3) and increases by 20 ms every hour, up to 560 ms at 23:00 UTC+3 (the first five pips always are 100 ms long). Russia&#x27;s state television Channel One broadcasts six tones too (at the end of a short melody) before newscasts and Vremya (the primetime news program).
* United States – NIST operates a speaking clock audio-only station, WWV.

<doc id="241075" wikidata="Q8934183" url="?curid=241075" title="Greek Anthology">
<text>The Greek Anthology () is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that span the Classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature. Most of the material of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; comes from two manuscripts, the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot; of the 10th century and the &quot;Anthology of Planudes&quot; (or &quot;Planudean Anthology&quot;) of the 14th century.

The earliest known anthology in Greek was compiled by Meleager of Gadara in the first century BC, under the title &quot;Anthologia&quot;, or &quot;Flower-gathering.&quot; It contained poems by the compiler himself and forty-six other poets, including Archilochus, Alcaeus, Anacreon, and Simonides. In his preface to his collection, Meleager describes his arrangement of poems as if it were a head-band or garland of flowers woven together. This metaphor gave rise to the word &quot;Anthology&quot;, meaning a collection of short literary works.

Meleager&#x27;s &quot;Anthology&quot; was popular enough that it attracted later additions. Prefaces to the editions of Philippus of Thessalonica and Agathias were preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; to attest to their additions of later poems. The definitive edition was made by Constantine Cephalas in the 10th century, who added a number of other collections: homoerotic verse collected by Straton of Sardis in the 2nd century AD; a collection of Christian epigrams found in churches; a collection of satirical and convivial epigrams collected by Diogenianus; Christodorus&#x27; description of statues in the Byzantine gymnasium of Zeuxippos; and a collection of inscriptions from a temple in Cyzicus.

The scholar Maximus Planudes also made an edition of the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot;, which while adding some poems, primarily deleted or bowdlerized many of the poems he felt were too explicit. His anthology was the only one known to Western Europe (his autograph copy, dated 1301 survives; the first edition based on his collection was printed in 1494) until 1606 when Claudius Salmasius found in the library at Heidelberg a fuller collection based on Cephalas. The copy made by Salmasius was not, however, published until 1776, when Richard François Philippe Brunck included it in his &quot;Analecta&quot;. The first critical edition was that of F. Jacobs (13 vols. 1794–1803; revised 1813–1817).

Since its transmission to the rest of Europe, the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; has left a deep impression on its readers. In a 1971 article on Robin Skelton&#x27;s translation of a selection of poems from the &quot;Anthology&quot;, a reviewer for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; wrote, &quot;The time of life does not exist when it is impossible to discover in it a masterly poem one had never seen before.&quot; Its influence can be seen on writers as diverse as Propertius, Ezra Pound and Edgar Lee Masters. Since full and uncensored English translations became available at the end of the 20th century, its influence has widened still further.

== Literary history ==
The art of occasional poetry had been cultivated in Greece from an early period, being used to commemorate remarkable individuals or events, on funerary monuments and votive offerings. These compositions were termed epigrams, i.e. inscribed poems. Such a composition must necessarily be brief, and as a result, conciseness of expression, pregnancy of meaning, purity of diction and singleness of thought are the indispensable conditions of excellence in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended to any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled.

About 60 BC, the sophist and poet Meleager of Gadara undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects, had previously been formed by Polemon Periegetes and others; but Meleager first gave the principle a comprehensive application. His selection, compiled from forty-six of his predecessors, and including numerous contributions of his own, was entitled &quot;The Garland&quot; (); in an introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed appropriate to his genius. The arrangement of his collection was alphabetical, according to the initial letter of each epigram.

In the age of the emperor Tiberius (or Trajan, according to others) the work of Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist, Philippus of Thessalonica, who first employed the term &quot;anthology&quot;. His collection, which included the compositions of thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager, was also arranged alphabetically, and contained an introductory poem. It was of inferior quality to Meleager&#x27;s. Somewhat later, under Hadrian, another supplement was formed by the sophist Diogenianus of Heracleia (2nd century AD), and Straton of Sardis compiled his elegant Μοῦσα παιδική (&quot;Musa Puerilis&quot;) from his productions and those of earlier writers. No further collection from various sources is recorded until the time of Justinian, when epigrammatic writing, especially of an amatory character, experienced a great revival at the hands of Agathias of Myrina, the historian, Paulus Silentiarius, and their circle. Their ingenious but mannered productions were collected by Agathias into a new anthology, entitled &quot;The Circle&quot; (Κύκλος); it was the first to be divided into books, and arranged with reference to the subjects of the pieces.

These and other collections made during the Middle Ages are now lost. The partial incorporation of them into a single body, classified according to the contents in 15 books, was the work of a certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved in the single MS. of his compilation extant, but who probably lived during the literary revival under Constantine Porphyrogenitus, at the beginning of the 10th century. He appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies, with the addition of selections from Lucillius, Palladas, and other epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published separately. His arrangement is founded on a principle of classification, and nearly corresponds to that adopted by Agathias. His principle of selection is unknown. The next editor was the monk Maximus Planudes (1320), who removed some epigrams from Cephalas&#x27; anthology, added some verses of his own, and preserved epigrams on works of art, which are not included in the only surviving transcript of Cephalas.

The Planudean Anthology (in seven books) was the only recension of the anthology known at the revival of classical literature, and was first published at Florence, by Janus Lascaris, in 1494. It long continued to be the only accessible collection, for although the Palatine manuscript known as the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered in the Palatine library at Heidelberg, and copied by Saumaise (Salmasius) in 1606, it was not published until 1776, when it was included in Brunck&#x27;s &quot;Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum&quot; (Crumbs of the Ancient Greek Poets). The manuscript itself had frequently changed its quarters. In 1623, having been taken in the sack of Heidelberg in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, it was sent with the rest of the Palatine Library to Rome as a present from Maximilian I of Bavaria to Pope Gregory XV, who had it divided into two parts, the first of which was by far the larger; thence it was taken to Paris in 1797. In 1816 it went back to Heidelberg, but in an incomplete state, the second part remaining at Paris. It is now represented at Heidelberg by a photographic facsimile.

Brunck&#x27;s edition was superseded by the standard one of Friedrich Jacobs (1794–1814, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more convenient form in 1813–1817, and occupies three pocket volumes in the Tauchnitz series of the classics. The best edition for general purposes is perhaps that of Dubner in Didot&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (1864–1872), which contains the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, the epigrams of the Planudean Anthology not collected in the former, an appendix of pieces derived from other sources, copious notes, a literal Latin prose translation by Jean François Boissonade, Bothe, and Lapaume and the metrical Latin versions of Hugo Grotius. A third volume, edited by E. Cougny, was published in 1890. The best edition of the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by van Bosch and van Lennep (1795–1822). There is also an incomplete edition of the text by Hugo Stadtmüller in the Teubner series, 3 vols., which stops at IX 563 due to Stadtmüller&#x27;s death. More recent editions are one in the Collection des Universités de France series, 13 vols., started by Pierre Waltz and continued by other scholars, and one edited by Hermann Beckby, 4 vols., in the Tusculum series. The most recent edition is by Fabrizio Conca, Mario Marzi and Giuseppe Zanetto, with the cooperation in vol. I of Carla Castelli, 3 vols., published by UTET.

== Arrangement ==
The Palatine MS., the archetype of the present text, was transcribed by different persons at different times, and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond with that signalized in the index. It is arranged into the following books:

# Christian epigrams; 
# Christodorus&#x27;s description of certain statues; 
# Inscriptions in the temple at Cyzicus; 
# The prefaces of Meleager, Philippus, and Agathias to their respective collections; 
# Amatory epigrams; 
# Votive inscriptions; 
# Epitaphs; 
# The epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 
# Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 
# Ethical pieces; 
# Humorous and convivial; 
# Strato&#x27;s &quot;Musa Puerilis&quot;; 
# Metrical curiosities; 
# Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 
# Miscellanies. 

The epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are missing from the &quot;Codex Palatinus&quot;, and must be sought in an appendix of epigrams only occurring in the Planudean Anthology. The epigrams hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and similar sources form appendices in the second and third volumes of Dübner&#x27;s edition. The Liddell Scott Greek Lexicon divides the Anthologia Graeca sources into &quot;Anthologia Palatina, Planudea&quot; (1864-1968), then &quot;Appendix nova epigrammatum&quot; (1890 onward).

== Style ==
The poems in the anthology represent different periods. Four stages may be indicated:
# The Hellenic proper, of which Simonides of Ceos (c. 556 – 469 BC), the author of most of the sepulchral inscriptions on those who fell in the Persian wars, is representative. Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual inscriptions or addresses to real personages, whether living or deceased.
# The epigram received a great development in its second or Alexandrian era, when its range was extended to include anecdote, satire, and amorous longing; when epitaphs and votive inscriptions were composed on imaginary persons and things. The modification has a representative in Leonidas of Tarentum, a contemporary of Pyrrhus of Epirus, and closes with Antipater of Sidon, about 140 BC (or later). Callimachus, one of the Alexandrian poets, affects stern simplicity in his epigrams.
# Meleager of Gadara was a Syrian; his pieces are usually erotic, with far-fetched conceits. His gaiety and licentiousness are imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary, the Epicurean Philodemus, and his fancy reappears in Philodemus&#x27;s contemporary, Zonas, in Crinagoras of Mytilene, who wrote under Augustus, and in Marcus Argentarius, of uncertain date. At a later period of the empire another &quot;genre&quot;, was developed, the satirical. Lucillus of Tarrha, who flourished under Nero, and Lucian, display a talent for shrewd, caustic epigram. The same style obtains with Palladas, an Alexandrian grammarian of the 4th century, the last of the strictly classical epigrammatists. His literary position is that of an indignant but despairing opponent of Christianity.
# The fourth or Byzantine style of epigrammatic composition was cultivated at the court of Justinian. The diction of Agathias and his compeers is ornate.

== Translations and imitations==
Latin renderings of select epigrams by Hugo Grotius were published in Bosch and Lennep&#x27;s edition of the Planudean &quot;Anthology&quot;, in the Didot edition, and in Henry Wellesley&#x27;s &quot;Anthologia Polyglotta&quot;. Imitations in modern languages have been copious, actual translations less common. F. D. Dehèque&#x27;s 1863 translation was in French prose. The German language admits of the preservation of the original metre, a circumstance exploited by Johann Gottfried Herder and Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs.

Robert Bland, John Herman Merivale, and their associates (1806–1813), produced efforts that are often diffuse. Francis Wrangham&#x27;s (1769–1842) versions, &quot;Poems&quot; (London, 1795), are more spirited; and John Sterling translated the inscriptions of Simonides. John Wilson in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; 1833–1835, collected and commented on the labours of these and other translators, including indifferent attempts of William Hay.

In 1849 Henry Wellesley, principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, published his &quot;Anthologia Polyglotta&quot;, a collection of the translations and imitations in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared versions by Goldwin Smith and Merivale, which, with the other English renderings extant at the time, accompany the literal prose translation of the &quot;Public School Selections&quot;, executed by the Rev. George Burges for Bohn&#x27;s Classical Library (1854).

In 1864 Major R. G. Macgregor published &quot;Greek Anthology, with notes critical and explanatory&quot;, an almost complete but mediocre translation of the Anthology. &quot;Idylls and Epigrams&quot;, by Richard Garnett (1869, reprinted 1892 in the Cameo series), includes about 140 translations or imitations, with some original compositions in the same style.

A small volume on the Anthology, edited and with some original translations by Lord Neaves, is one of W. Lucas Collins&#x27;s series &quot;Ancient Classics for Modern Readers&quot;, &quot;The Greek Anthology&quot; (Edinburgh &amp; London: William Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1874) 

Two critical contributions to the subject are the Rev. James Davies&#x27;s essay on Epigrams in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (vol. cxvii.), illustrating the distinction between Greek and Latin epigram; and the disquisition in J. A. Symonds&#x27;s &quot;Studies of the Greek Poets&quot; (1873; 3rd ed., 1893).

<doc id="241078" wikidata="Q4922945" url="?curid=241078" title="Black Hawk (British comics)">
<text>Black Hawk was a comic strip appearing on the British magazine &quot;Tornado&quot;, created by Gerry Finley-Day. It was one of three strips to transfer from &quot;Tornado&quot; to &quot;2000 AD&quot; after the two merged.

==Creation==
The lead character was inspired by Woody Strode&#x27;s role in the film &quot;Spartacus&quot;.

==Plot synopsis==

At the time of the Roman Empire a Nubian slave rises up against his captors and leads a rebellion. However his bravery is recognised by a Roman General and he is commissioned as a Roman Centurion. Black Hawk took his name from a Hawk that he adopted and assembled a crack platoon from hardened prisoners and other slaves. As with other Finley-Day war stories the basic plot was borrowed from &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; with Black Hawk&#x27;s squad being singled out for the hardest missions.

In &quot;2000 AD&quot; he is taken from his Roman captors by an alien species only to be entered into their own intergalactic gladiatorial events against other alien species. Black Hawk adopts a Wookiee type alien as a sidekick (ironically the Hawk that gave him his name was left behind on earth). Black Hawk manages to escape but ends up stranded on a planet orbiting a black hole. Here a creature called &quot;The SoulSucker&quot; removes Black Hawks soul and he pursues the SoulSucker relentlessly, eventually regaining it shortly before the end of the series run.

Eventually, Tharg the Mighty&#x27;s race were written in, as a robotic &quot;Kwark&quot; created by the &quot;Thargians&quot;, and the whole cast were sucked into a black hole. They are later seen in Tharg&#x27;s desk drawer, full of other dead or discarded characters, where Black Hawk complains how long they have been waiting as Ace Garp is selected for a revival.

In the &quot;2000 AD Yearbook&quot; 1994 it was acknowledged by the editor that this was a poor series, and Alan Grant had written himself into a corner.

<text>Marc-Émile Ruchet (14 September 1853, in Saint-Saphorin-sur-Morges – 13 July 1912, in Bern) was a French-speaking Swiss politician.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 14 December 1899 and resigned on 9 July 1912, only four days before his death. He was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party. 

While in office he held the following departments:
* Department of Home Affairs (1900 –1903)
* Department of Finance (1904)
* Political Department (1905)
* Department of Home Affairs (1906–1910)
* Political Department (1911)
* Department of Home Affairs (1912)
He was President of the Confederation twice, in 1905 and 1911.

== Biography ==
Ruchet was born as the son of Charles, a teacher, and Lina Elise née Bäurlin. He studied law in Lausanne and Heidelberg and earned a licence at Lausanne university in 1875.

In the office of Louis Ruchonnet, Ruchet gained first experience in the legal area and was admitted to the bar in 1878. From 1886 until 1888 he sat on the board of directors of the Suisse Occidentale Simplon railways, and from 1890 until 1899 on the board of the Jura–Simplon Railways.

Elected to the Federal Council in 1899, he minted the federal law on the forestry services (1902). After the death of his wife his bad health deteriorated further. Only a few days after stepping down in 1912, Ruchet died.

<text>Fridolin Anderwert (19 September 1828, in Frauenfeld – 25 December 1880) was a Swiss politician.

He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 10 December 1875 and was member of the council until 25 December 1880. He was affiliated to the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland.

During his office time he held the Department of Justice and Police and was Vice-President of the Swiss Confederation in 1880.

On 7 December 1880 he was elected President of the Swiss Confederation for the year 1881. Immediately after the election a nasty campaign against him broke out in the press, in particular about the eating habits of the obese bachelor, but also rumors that he was a regular visitor in brothels. Drawn by physical exhaustion and severe depression, Anderwert killed himself on Christmas Day 1880 on the &quot;Kleine Schanze&quot;, a small park next to the Houses of Parliament. The only published sentence of his farewell letter states: &quot;They want a victim, they shall have it.&quot;

<text>Wilhelm Matthias Naeff (19 February 1802 – 21 January 1881) was a Swiss politician and one of the seven initial members of the Swiss Federal Council (1848–1875).

Naeff was born in Altstätten into a long-established Rhine-Valley&#x27;s family. Already, his father was an influential merchant. Naeff studied law in Heidelberg (Germany), and, after his return to Switzerland, he was elected to the cantonal (state) government of St. Gallen. Naeff is well known for not intervening in the conflict, which dominated Switzerland at that time, between liberals and conservatives. The Rhine Valley was a stronghold of the liberals, which is why Naeff could depend on his supporters.

Naeff was a member of the &quot;Siebnergruppe&quot;, a group of seven people who, after the Napoleonic occupation, drafted the 1848 constitution of the Swiss Confederation, the basis of the current constitution. He was elected to the Swiss Federal Council of ministers on 16 November 1848, as a representative of St. Gallen. He stayed there for 27 years, considerably longer than all of his counterparts from that time.

While, in his long term in office, Naeff increasingly lost influence and adhered a reputation as &quot;deadhead&quot;. He was re-elected by only small margins. On 31 December 1875, he finally resigned. Naeff was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (liberal democrats/radicals).

During his long tenure, he headed the following departments:
*Department of Posts and Construction (1848–1852)
*Political Department (1853)
*Department of Trade and Customs (1854)
*Department of Posts and Construction (1855–1859)
*Department of Posts (1860–1866)
*Department of Trade and Customs (1867–1872)
*Department of Railway and Trade (1873)
*Department of Finance (1873–1875)

In 1853, he was President of the Confederation, presiding the council. He resigned on 31 December 1875.

<text>basename is a standard computer program on Unix and Unix-like operating systems. When basename is given a pathname, it will delete any prefix up to the last slash (codice_1) character and return the result. basename is described in the Single UNIX Specification and is primarily used in shell scripts.

==History==
 was introduced in X/Open Portability Guidelines issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in 4.4BSD.

The version of codice_2 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David MacKenzie.

The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the GnuWin32 project and the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Usage==
The Single UNIX Specification for basename is.
 basename string [suffix]

:string
::A pathname
:suffix
::If specified, basename will also delete the suffix.

==Examples==
basename will retrieve the last name from a pathname ignoring any trailing slashes

$ basename /home/jsmith/base.wiki 
base.wiki

$ basename /home/jsmith/
jsmith

$ basename /

basename can also be used to remove the end of the base name, but not the complete base name

$ basename /home/jsmith/base.wiki .wiki
base

$ basename /home/jsmith/base.wiki ki
base.wi

$ basename /home/jsmith/base.wiki base.wiki
base.wiki

<text>Villanova University is a private Catholic research university in Villanova, Pennsylvania, United States. It was founded by the Order of Saint Augustine in 1842 and named after Saint Thomas of Villanova. The university is the oldest Catholic university in Pennsylvania and one of two Augustinian institutions of higher learning in the United States (the other being Merrimack College).

The university traces its roots to the old Saint Augustine&#x27;s Church, Philadelphia, which the Augustinian friars of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova founded in 1796, and to its parish school, Saint Augustine&#x27;s Academy, which was established in 1811. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
In October 1841, two Irish Augustinian friars from Saint Augustine&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia, with the intention of starting a school, purchased in Radnor Township. Known as &quot;Belle Air&quot;, the estate belonged to the late John Rudolph, a merchant of Burlington, New Jersey and Philadelphia. The school, which was called the &quot;Augustinian College of Villanova&quot;, opened in 1842. Besides the novitiate and college, the Augustinians had pastoral care of Catholics living within a fifteen mile radius. Bishop Francis Kenrick dedicated the chapel in 1844. Parishes at Berwyn, Bryn Mawr, and Wayne developed from the Villanova mission.

However, the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844 that burned Saint Augustine&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia caused financial difficulties for the Augustinians, and the college was closed in February 1845. The college reopened in 1846 and graduated its first class in 1847. In March 1848, the governor of Pennsylvania incorporated the school and gave it the power to grant degrees. In 1859, the first master&#x27;s degree was conferred. In 1857, the school closed again as the demand for priests in Philadelphia prevented adequate staffing, and the crisis of the Panic of 1857 strained the school financially. The school remained closed throughout the Civil War and was used as a military hospital. It reopened in September 1865; since then it has operated continuously. Its prep school later moved to Malvern, a town along the Main Line. Today it is called Malvern Preparatory School and is still run by the order.

Villanova was all-male until 1918 when the college began evening classes to educate nuns to teach in parochial schools. In 1938, a laywoman received a Villanova degree for the first time. When the nursing school opened in 1953, women began attending Villanova full-time. In 1958, the College of Engineering admitted its first female student; other colleges admitted women only as commuters. Villanova University became fully coeducational in 1968.

During World War II, Villanova was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. It has since graduated 25 US Naval Admirals and Marine Corps Generals; only the Naval Academy in Annapolis has generated more.

After World War II, Villanova expanded, returning veterans swelling enrollments and the faculty growing fourfold. Additional facilities were built, and in 1953, the college of Nursing and the School of Law were established. Villanova achieved university status on November 18, 1953. Between 1954 and 1963, 10 new buildings were built or bought on land adjacent to the campus, including Bartley, Mendel, and Dougherty Halls.

Villanova and Cabrini University issued a joint statement on June 23, 2023, announcing that Cabrini would cease operations in 2024 and be incorporated into Villanova.

==Campus==

The university is within the Villanova census-designated place in Radnor Township.

Villanova University sits on of land, situated from Center City Philadelphia. The campus has roughly 1,500 trees. The campus was formerly known as Arboretum Villanova, but its status as an official arboretum was revoked after the university failed to meet rules and standards such as planting enough new trees and offering tours.

===Main campus===
The most prominent campus feature is St. Thomas of Villanova Church, whose dual spires are the university&#x27;s tallest structure. The cornerstone was laid in 1883, and construction ended in 1887.

Alumni Hall dates back to 1848 and stands as one of the oldest structures on campus. It was used as a military hospital in wartime and for influenza patients after World War I.

St. Mary&#x27;s Hall was built in 1962. Laid out with long corridors and over a thousand rooms, there is a large, recently deconsecrated chapel and many partial floors, basements and sub-basements to feed the legends of blocked-off wings. Falvey Library, the campus&#x27;s main research library, houses over 1 million books, thousands of periodicals, and television production studios.

==Academics==
According to the National Science Foundation, Villanova spent $26 million on research and development in 2022, ranking it 264th in the nation.

===Rankings===
In a deliberate move to classify itself as a &quot;national university&quot;, Villanova pushed in early 2010s to expand its doctoral programs to reach the Carnegie threshold of 20 PhDs per year. In September 2016, the university&#x27;s Carnegie Classification was changed to classify Villanova among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity&quot;. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, which relies on this classification to define which schools should be called &quot;national universities&quot;, included Villanova in its &quot;National Universities&quot; rankings for the first time in fall 2016.

For more than a decade, Villanova University had been ranked No. 1 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in the Best Masters Universities-category, Northern Region, a ranking for schools which offer undergraduate and masters programs but few doctoral programs. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in 2016 also ranked Villanova as second for &quot;Best Value Schools&quot; and fourth for &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; in the Best Masters Universities-category, Northern Region, and ranked the engineering school No.11 among all national undergraduate engineering programs whose highest degree is a masters.

&quot;In 2025 U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Villanova as tied for the 58th best National University in the U.S. and the 69th Best Value School.

The Villanova School of Business was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. in &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;″s 2016 rankings of undergraduate business schools, but this led to controversy and challenge. As a result Bloomberg no longer ranked undergraduate business schools after 2016. In 2007 Villanova was No. 29 in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27; ranking of top executive MBA programs. However, for the 2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Rankings of best business schools, Villanova was unranked.

Villanova University School of Law was ranked tied for 65th among all U.S. law schools by the 2019 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s &quot;Best Law Schools&quot;. The School of Law had previously suffered a drop in ranking in 2011, after it was determined that law school admissions staff had engaged in inflating reported LSAT scores for admitted students. According to the ABA, these infractions were enough to justify a removal of the school&#x27;s accreditation, however the quick response to the issue by the university resulted only in a censure of the school.

===Admissions===

Admission to Villanova has been deemed &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The university offers three ways to apply: Early Decision (binding), Early Action and Regular Decision.

For fall 2023, Villanova received 23,721 freshmen applications; 4,870 were admitted (21%) for a class of 1700. The middle 50% GPA range: 4.20–4.58 on a weighted 4.00 scale. The middle 50% SAT scores of the recently admitted class: 1450–1520/1600, ACT: 33–35/36.

In 2019, Villanova announced new recruiting partnerships with The Posse Foundation, Philadelphia Futures and the Guadalupe Center.

==Student life==

Villanova&#x27;s student organizations include standard club sports, cultural organizations, Greek-letter fraternities and sororities, and more. Villanova students participate in charitable and philanthropic activities and organizations, including the largest student-run Special Olympics in the world.

===Charity and community service organizations===
Being a Catholic Augustinian school, the university has an active Campus Ministry.

The annual Special Olympics Fall Festival at Villanova University is the largest and most successful student-run Special Olympics in the world. It draws more than 1,000 athletes and 400 coaches from 44 Pennsylvania counties. Athletes may advance through the festival to regional and international competition. Students apply to be a part of the 82-volunteer planning committee, which works for more than nine months alongside Special Olympics Pennsylvania (SOPA), which oversees more than 300 events statewide.

Villanova University holds an annual NOVAdance year-long fundraising effort that culminates with a 12-hour dance marathon each Spring, raising money in support of the Andrew McDonough B+ (Be Positive) Foundation. NOVAdance began in 2014, and has since then become a yearly event.

The Villanova University community is noted for its participation in Habitat for Humanity In 2004, Villanova had more participants in the Habitat for Humanity Collegiate Challenge than any other U.S. university.

Villanova&#x27;s School of Engineering maintains a student chapter of Engineers Without Borders, a non-profit organization that focuses on helping to improve the living conditions of communities worldwide.

The chapter&#x27;s inaugural project was to design and build a playground for a grade school in New Orleans following the tragic events of Hurricane Katrina. Villanova EWB was the only student organization to win an award from the regional Project Management Institute, receiving an Honorable Mention from PMI for project of the year. The most recent project involved designing and building a water treatment and distribution system which provided an orphanage and surrounding villages in northern Thailand with drinking water and irrigation for their crops.

The Blue Key Society consists of around 200 volunteer campus tour guides who work with the Admissions Office to give three tours each weekday, various special tours as needed and selected weekend tours throughout the school year.

=== Student Government Association ===
Founded in 1925, the Student Government Association (SGA) operates through its three branches (the Executive Branch, the Senate, and the Judicial Council). The Executive Branch is led by the President of the Student Body and Executive Vice President, and consists of the Chief of Staff and Directors of Athletics; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Finance; Programming; and Public Relations. The Senate is led by the Speaker of the Senate and consists of thirty-four Senators total, twenty-two elected representatives from the classes and schools and twelve appointed representatives from University offices and student organizations. The Judicial Council is led by the Chief Justice and consists of four Associate Justices and a Judicial Clerk.

===Fraternities and sororities===
Roughly 30% of Villanova students identify with one of eleven fraternities, twelve sororities, and one service fraternity. There are no fraternity or sorority houses on-campus. The first Greek organization at the school was established in 1902 as a social organization and circle of individuals interested in classical studies.

===Villanova Emergency Medical Service===
Villanova Emergency Medical Service (VEMS), is a student-run ambulance service licensed and dedicated to serving the campus community. VEMS membership consists of more than 40 undergraduate student volunteers; the majority of whom are certified as Emergency Medical Technicians, volunteering more than 25,000 hours annually. Villanova is one of only a handful of colleges to provide EMS services to their campus, and one of only 52 who provide emergency response and transport to at least the Basic Life Support (BLS) Level. VEMS has been recognized on a national level multiple times by the National Collegiate EMS Foundation (NCEMSF), specifically being named 2001 Campus Organization of the Year and receiving EMS website of the year in 2000, 2004, and 2006. Their skills competition team also placed in second at the 2011 Annual Physio-Control BLS Skills Competition. VEMS hosted the second annual NCEMSF Conference in 1995 as well as the twelfth annual conference in Philadelphia in 2005.

===Campus publications and media===

&quot;The Villanovan&quot; has been an officially recognized and accredited student newspaper since its founding in 1916. The university&#x27;s newspaper of record, the tabloid-sized weekly usually produces 12 issues per semester, at 6,500 copies per issue.

&quot;The Belle Air Yearbook&quot; is the official yearbook of the university and has been a student-made production since 1922. The book is published by the L.G. Balfour Company. The book has won numerous awards over the years including the prestigious Columbia Scholastic Press Association Gold Crown Award in 1988 and 1989 and the Yearbook Award for their 2017 book and the National Yearbook Sample Award for their 2019 publication.

&quot;The Villanova Times&quot;, the independent bi-weekly student newspaper, won the Collegiate Network Award for Layout and Design in 2005–06, 2007–08 and 2008–09.

VTV is the student-run campus television station. Starting in 1999 as the Villanova TV Production Club, the station produces news, events, films and other programming for the Villanova community, and can be seen on the campus television network.

WXVU, the FCC-licensed student-operated FM radio station, operates at 89.1 megahertz. With an output of 75 watts, WXVU can be heard for around the campus and globally via the internet. Since 1991, the station has offered a varied program of music, news, sports, public affairs, and specialty programming.

&quot;POLIS Literary Magazine&quot;, a student publication printed once a semester by the Villanova University Honors Program, features writing and artwork by Villanova students and professors. Each issue features creative nonfiction, poetry, short fiction, and black-and-white photography focusing on a central theme.

&quot;Concept&quot; is an interdisciplinary journal of graduate studies sponsored by the Graduate Division of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The 2009 student film &quot;Price of Life&quot; received critical attention.

===NROTC===
Since its inception in the summer of 1946, the NROTC unit on campus has produced 25 Admirals and Generals in the United States Navy and Marine Corps. At one point, there had only been two four-star generals in the U.S. Marine Corps, one of them the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and they had both been graduates of Villanova NROTC. In 2004, the commanders of both U.S. Naval Forces Atlantic (Admiral William J. Fallon) and U.S. Naval Forces Pacific (Admiral Walter F. Doran) were Villanova NROTC graduates. Admiral Fallon was later assigned as Commander, U.S. Central Command from March 2007 to March 2008. ADM Fallon was the first Navy officer to hold that position.

===Student performing arts===

Villanova University is without a formal music department; therefore, the Office of Student Performing Arts is charged with the organization of the student performing arts groups on campus. Due to the lack of a music department, student musicians are from every school in the university. Nearly 10% of the student body participates in various music related organizations.

The Villanova Band is the largest and oldest musical group at Villanova with over 100 members. The Villanova Band has four divisions: the Concert Band, the Scramble Band, the Pep Band, and the Jazz Ensemble. The Concert Band plays one concert at the end of each semester. It also performs throughout the Villanova community and on its annual &quot;Fall Tour&quot;. The Scramble Band performs for Villanova Football games between plays and at halftime on the field. The Villanova Pep Band performs at Villanova Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball games, including post-season games such as the Big East Tournament. The Jazz Ensemble and Orchestra have end-of-semester concerts and perform on campus and around the Philadelphia area several times a year. The band is made up of students of every school within Villanova.

The second-largest musical group at Villanova, the Pastoral Musicians have about 60 voices and 35 instrumentalists, primarily undergraduates, up from 30 musicians in 1995. Their musical selection shows the diversity of style within the Catholic tradition: contemporary praise music from different cultures, Bach, Palestrina, Mozart, Lauridsen, and others.

Villanova&#x27;s men&#x27;s chorus, the Villanova Singers, was founded in 1953 by Dean Harold Gill Reuschlein, then Dean of the Law School. The Singers were established for the stated purpose of singing various types of music and enriching the cultural life of the university. Entirely student-run, the Singers are governed by a nine-member board of students and sing a wide range of musical styles and types, ranging from classical to contemporary. Within the Singers, there exists a smaller, student-directed &quot;a cappella&quot; group known as the Spires. Alumni of the Spires include Jim Croce, Tommy West and Manhattan Transfer member Tim Hauser.

The Villanova Voices women&#x27;s chorus is the oldest women&#x27;s organization at the university. Originally called the Villanova Women&#x27;s Glee Club, the group was founded by 20 women from the university&#x27;s College of Nursing in 1960, shortly after Villanova became coeducational. Their attendant &quot;a cappella&quot; group, the Haveners, is student-directed.

==Athletics==

Villanova University teams are known as the Wildcats. They compete as a member of the NCAA Division I level, primarily competing in the Big East Conference. The Wildcats previously competed in the Eastern 8 Conference from 1975 to 1976 to 1979–80. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and water polo. The football and rowing team competes in the Colonial Athletic Association, while the women&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in the Patriot League.

The Wildcats are also part of the Philadelphia Big 5, the traditional Philadelphia-area basketball rivalry. Their fiercest crosstown rivalry is with Saint Joseph&#x27;s University (&quot;St. Joe&#x27;s&quot;), the city&#x27;s Jesuit university, and matches between them are called the &quot;Holy War&quot;.

In the NCAA graduation report released on November 17, 2020, Villanova has a graduation-success rate (GSR) of 97 percent rate in the NCAA GSR method. In the GSR release, Villanova had 12 of its athletic programs post a perfect 100 percent graduation success rate for the 2010-2013 cohort. This data measures the percentage of student-athletes who entered college on institutional aid (whether athletics-based aid or otherwise) between those years and graduated within six years. Villanova had seven women&#x27;s programs and five men&#x27;s programs earn a 100 percent GSR in the release. The Villanova women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s basketball team are among the athletic program&#x27;s 14 teams with a 100 percent graduation rate for 2010–13.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
In 1985, under the direction of coach Rollie Massimino, the men&#x27;s basketball team won the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in the first year of the 64-team field. The final game, against defending champion and ten-point-favorite Georgetown, is often cited among the greatest upsets in college basketball history.

In 2016, the Wildcats won the 2016 NCAA Championship by defeating North Carolina 77–74. The game included the only buzzer-beater in NCAA Championship game history, when Kris Jenkins sank a three pointer to win the game.

In 2018, Villanova defeated the Michigan Wolverines 79–62 to win the 2018 NCAA Championship in San Antonio. The game was notable for featuring the highest scoring bench-player in NCAA Championship history in Donte Divincenzo, who scored 31 points and was awarded the Final Four MVP Award.

The home venues for the Wildcats include the on-campus 6,500 seat Finneran Pavilion for smaller attendance games, as well as the larger 20,478 seat Wells Fargo Center (known formerly under a variety of bank names) within the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The February 13, 2006 meeting between Villanova and the University of Connecticut set the record for the highest attendance at a college basketball game in Pennsylvania, with 20,859 attendees.

===Football===
The Villanova men&#x27;s football team competes in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) in the Coastal Athletic Association Football Conference. The university continues to play in the Colonial Athletic Association for football as the new, restructured Big East Conference does not include football as a conference sport.

According to some sources, the 1906 Villanova team is credited with completing the first legal forward pass in football history.

===Men&#x27;s lacrosse===
The Villanova men&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in NCAA Division I as a member of the Big East Conference. Through 2009, Villanova men&#x27;s lacrosse was a member of the Colonial Athletic Association and in 2009, Villanova won the CAA tournament as the fourth seed (the lowest-seeded championship team in conference history) for its first title. The team also made its first NCAA tournament appearance that year.

===Track and field===
Villanova University&#x27;s track and field team has a long history of athletic success that has spanned from Big East Conference Championships to NCAA Championships.

The men&#x27;s team has produced 69 NCAA Championships, 36 Indoor and 33 Outdoor. The team has had eight NCAA team Championships (four Cross Country, three Indoor, one Outdoor). Villanova has produced 28 athletes who have made appearances in the Olympics, 10 of whom have medaled (seven gold medals, three silver medals). The men&#x27;s team has also won 112 Penn Relay Championships, which stands as the most wins by any school. The men&#x27;s current coaches include head coach Marcus O&#x27;Sullivan and assistant head coach Anthony Williams.

The women&#x27;s team has also had a multitude of success, producing 11 Big East team Championships and nine NCAA team Championships, most recently winning the 2009 and 2010 NCAA Cross Country Championships. They have also produced nine Olympians including Ron Delany, Eamonn Coghlan, Vicki Huber, Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan, Kim Certain, Kate Fonshell, Jen Rhines, Carmen Douma, and Carrie Tollefson. The Women&#x27;s team has won 28 Penn Relay Championships, which is the most wins by any women&#x27;s team. The current women&#x27;s coaches include head coach Gina Procaccio and assistant head coach Anthony Williams.

At least one Villanovan athlete has competed in every Summer Olympics since 1948, winning a total of 13 medals (nine gold, four silver).

==Traditions==

===The University Seal===
An adaptation of the seal of the Order of St. Augustine, the seal of Villanova University is one of the campus&#x27;s most ubiquitous images, adorning everything from buildings to chairs to backpacks. A ribbon carries the university motto: &quot;Veritas, Unitas, Caritas&quot; (Truth, Unity, and Charity), virtues to which every member of the Villanova community should aspire. A book symbolizes Augustine&#x27;s dedication to education and the New Testament where he found Christianity. A cincture is part of the habit worn by members of the Order of Saint Augustine. Hovering above is the flaming heart, symbol of Augustine&#x27;s search for God and his love of neighbors. Behind the book is the crosier – a staff traditionally held by a Bishop – commemorating Augustine&#x27;s service as Bishop of Hippo. Above and behind the book are two crosses, symbolic of Augustine&#x27;s conversion and the university&#x27;s commitment to Catholicism. Framing the central portion of the seal is a laurel wreath exemplifying victory through the pursuit of knowledge, and 1842 is the year of the university&#x27;s founding. Surrounding the seal is the incorporated fide of the university: &quot;Universitas Villanova In Statu Pennsylvaniae&quot;.

===Liberty Bell&#x27;s &quot;Sister Bell&quot;===
Villanova University was home to the Liberty Bell&#x27;s &quot;Sister Bell&quot;, the replacement bell ordered from the Whitechapel Bell Foundry after the original bell cracked in 1753. This new bell was installed at the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, and attached to the State House clock. The Sister Bell rang the hours until the late 1820s, when the bell was removed during a renovation and loaned to the Olde St. Augustine Church in Philadelphia. In 1829, the bell was hung in a new cupola and tower designed by architect William Strickland. There it remained until May 8, 1844, when it was destroyed, along with the Olde St. Augustine Church, during the Philadelphia Nativist riots. The friars of the Order of Saint Augustine had the &quot;Sister Bell&quot; recast and transferred to Villanova University. The bell was moved off campus in 2011.

At the university&#x27;s centennial celebration, the bell was rung by Archbishop Dennis Joseph Dougherty to open the ceremonies. In 1954, the bell was displayed as part of an exhibit at Gimbels department store in Philadelphia that focused on the growth and development of the university. The Sister Bell is currently enshrined in the Heritage Room on the basement floor of the St. Thomas of Villanova Monastery on the university&#x27;s campus.

<doc id="241102" wikidata="Q1044668" url="?curid=241102" title="Republic of Rose Island">
<text>The Republic of Rose Island (; , both literally &quot;Republic of the Island of the Roses&quot;) was a short-lived micronation on a man-made platform in the Adriatic Sea, off the coast of the region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, built by Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa, who made himself its president and declared it an independent state on 1 May 1968.

Although Rose Island had its own government, currency, post office, and commercial establishments, and the official language was Esperanto, it was never formally recognized as a sovereign state by any country of the world. The Italian government viewed it as a ploy by Rosa to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Rose Island was occupied by Italian police forces on 26 June 1968, subjected to a naval blockade, and eventually demolished in February 1969.

==Etymology==
It is believed that the Esperanto term (in ) was borrowed from the surname of Giorgio Rosa, the designer and builder of the artificial platform, as well as the creator and inspirer of the state entity, as well as from his desire to &quot;see roses bloom on the sea&quot;.

==History==
In 1958, Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa funded the construction of a platform supported by nine pylons and furnished it with a number of commercial establishments, including a restaurant, bar, nightclub, souvenir shop, and post office, with construction being completed in 1967.

The platform declared independence on 1 May 1968, under the Esperanto name &quot;Insulo de la Rozoj&quot;, with Rosa as self-declared president. Rose Island issued a number of stamps, including one showing its approximate location in the Adriatic Sea. The purported currency of the republic was the mill, and this appeared on early stamp issues, although no coins or banknotes are known to have been produced.

Rosa&#x27;s actions were viewed by the Italian government as a ploy to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Whether or not this was the real reason behind Rosa&#x27;s micronation, the Italian government&#x27;s response was swift: On 26 June 1968, 55 days after the island declared independence, the Italian navy sent a group of four carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza officers, who assumed control, cleared the island, and set up a blockade so no one could re-enter.

At first, the Italian government tried to dismantle the island, but they found it impossible, so they decided to blow it up instead. The Italian Navy bombed the island twice, with the first time failing, and the second bombing taking place on 13 February 1969, but the island still stood. Afterward, Rosa&#x27;s self-declared government in exile created stamps depicting the events. Rosa was billed by the Italian government for war costs. Finally, on 26 February 1969, the island was toppled by a storm. Only one death was counted but never confirmed: apparently, Rosa&#x27;s dog was on the platform during the facility&#x27;s detonation.

Rosa died in 2017, having given his blessing for a film to be made about Rose Island. This was released in 2020.

Since the first decade of the 2000s, Rose Island&#x27;s history has been the subject of documentary research and rediscoveries, based on the utopian aspect of its genesis.

<text>The Notting Hill Carnival is an annual Caribbean Carnival event that has taken place in London since 1966 on the streets of the Notting Hill area of Kensington, over the August Bank Holiday weekend.

It is led by members of the British Caribbean community, and attracts around two million people annually, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest street festivals, and a significant event in British African Caribbean and British Indo-Caribbean culture. In 2006, the UK public voted it onto a list of icons of England.

Carnival traditionally commences on the Saturday with &quot;Panorama&quot;, a competition between steelpan bands. Sunday is designated family and childrens day, with a shorter parade route for young people. The main adult parade takes place on Monday. Notting Hill Carnival represents the &#x27;five disciplines of carnival&#x27;: masquerade, calypso, soca, steelpan, and sound systems.

== History ==
The origin of Notting Hill Carnival can be traced to a number of roots. 

A &quot;Caribbean Carnival&quot; was held on 30 January 1959 in St Pancras Town Hall as a response to the problematic state of race relations at the time; the UK&#x27;s first widespread racial attacks, the Notting Hill race riots in which 108 people were charged, had occurred the previous year. This was organised by the Trinidadian journalist and activist Claudia Jones, often described as &quot;the mother of the Notting Hill Carnival&quot; in her capacity as editor of influential black newspaper &quot;The West Indian Gazette&quot;, and directed by Edric Connor. It showcased elements of a Caribbean carnival in a cabaret style. It featured the Mighty Terror singing the calypso &quot;Carnival at St Pancras&quot;, The Southlanders, Cleo Laine, the Trinidad All Stars and Hi–fi steel bands dance troupe, finishing with a Caribbean Carnival Queen beauty contest and a Grand Finale Jump-Up by West Indians who attended the event.

The first outside event in Notting Hill was in August 1966, a hippie London Free School-inspired festival organised by Rhaune Laslett, who was not aware of the indoor events when she first raised the idea. This festival was a more diverse Notting Hill event to promote cultural unity. A street party for neighbourhood children turned into a carnival procession when Russell Henderson&#x27;s steel band (who had played at the earlier Claudia Jones events) went on a walkabout. By 1970, &quot;the Notting Hill Carnival consisted of 2 music bands, the Russell Henderson Combo and Selwyn Baptiste&#x27;s Notting Hill Adventure Playground Steelband and 500 dancing spectators.&quot;

Leslie Palmer, who was director from 1973 to 1975, is credited with &quot;getting sponsorship, recruiting more steel bands, reggae groups and sound systems, introducing generators and extending the route.&quot; He encouraged traditional masquerade, and for the first time in 1973 costume bands and steel bands from the various islands took part in the street parade, alongside the introduction of stationary sound systems, as distinct from those on moving floats, which, as Alex Pascall has explained, &quot;created the bridge between the two cultures of carnival, reggae and calypso.&quot; &quot;Notting Hill Carnival became a major festival in 1975 when it was organised by a young teacher, Leslie Palmer.&quot; The carnival was also popularised by live radio broadcasts by Pascall on his daily &quot;Black Londoners&quot; programme for BBC Radio London.

Duke Vin, full name Vincent George Forbes, is credited as being a co-founder of Notting Hill Carnival, having brought the first sound system to the United Kingdom in 1955 when he was a stowaway on a ship from Jamaica to the United Kingdom, and brought what is thought to be the very first sound system to the Notting Hill Carnival in 1973, which paved the way for the many sound systems that operate at carnival today. Duke Vin became a legend in Ladbroke Grove and had a huge influence on the popularisation of reggae and ska in Britain, and played at Notting Hill Carnival with his sound system, &quot;Duke Vin the Tickler&#x27;s&quot;, every year from the year it was founded until his death in 2012.

Emslie Horniman&#x27;s Pleasance (in the Kensal Green district of the area), has been the carnival&#x27;s traditional starting point. Among the early bands to participate were Ebony Steelband and Metronomes Steelband. As the carnival had no permanent staff and head office, the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill, run by another Trinidadian, Frank Crichlow, came to function as an informal communication hub and office address for the carnival&#x27;s organisers.

The 1976 carnival was marred by riots, in which predominantly Caribbean youths fought with police – a target due to the continuous harassment the population felt they were under. During this period, there was considerable press coverage of the disorder, which some felt took an unfairly negative and one-sided view of the carnival. For a while it looked as if the event would be banned. Prince Charles was one of the few establishment figures who supported the event. Leila Hassan campaigned for Arts Council England to recognise the Notting Hill Carnival as an art form. Since 1978 the national Panorama competition is held on the Saturday preceding the carnival.

Concerns about the size of the event resulted in London&#x27;s then mayor, Ken Livingstone, setting up a Carnival Review Group to look into &quot;formulating guidelines to safeguard the future of the Carnival&quot;. An interim report by the review resulted in a change to the route in 2002. When the full report was published in 2004, it recommended that Hyde Park be used as a &quot;savannah&quot; (an open space to draw crowds away from residential areas), though the proposal of such a move attracted concerns, including that the Hyde Park event might overshadow the original street carnival.

Aswad&#x27;s performance at the 1983 Carnival was released as an album &quot;Live and Direct&quot;.

The Carnival further diversified in 1984 with the appearance of the London School of Samba and other samba schools followed in the 1990s.

Sound systems greatly expanded during the 1980s and 1990s, some of the biggest including Channel One, Saxon Sound, Mastermind Roadshow, RapAttack, and Good Times. 

In 2003, the Notting Hill Carnival was run by a limited company, the Notting Hill Carnival Trust Ltd. A report by the London Development Agency on the 2002 Carnival estimated that the event contributed around £93 million to the London and UK economy, set against an estimated £6–10 million costs. However, the 2016 residents&#x27; survey commissioned by local Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Victoria Borwick found that while 6% of businesses reported an upturn in trade, many others boarded up their shopfronts and lost business due to closure.

In 2015, there was controversy when the Carnival Trust charged journalists £100 to cover the event, and demanded copies of all work produced relating to the event within three weeks of the end of the Carnival. The National Union of Journalists organised a boycott of the event. In 2016 the charge remained; however, in June 2017, the Carnival&#x27;s new event management team introduced a revised media policy, with no request for any accreditation fees.

In 2016, when the Golden Jubilee of Notting Hill Carnival was celebrated, 42 hours of live video coverage was broadcast by music live-streaming platform Boiler Room from the Rampage, Deviation, Aba Shanti-I, Channel One, Nasty Love, Saxon Sound, King Tubbys, Gladdy Wax and Disya Jeneration soundsystems.

The 2020 carnival was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although free live-streamed events were shown online across four channels. On 18 June 2021, it was announced that the 2021 Carnival would not take place either, due to &quot;ongoing uncertainty and Covid-19 risk&quot;.

In 2022, Notting Hill Carnival returned after a two-year hiatus. It started with a run to remember 72 victims of the Grenfell Tower fire from 2017. The 2023 carnival ran from 27–28 August.

In 2023, Notting Hill Carnival was included in the Vision:2025 programme, a Green Events Code of Practice.

== Culture of the carnival ==
Professor David Dabydeen has stated:

&quot;Carnival is not alien to British culture. Bartholomew Fair and Southwark Fair in the 18th century were moments of great festivity and release. There was juggling, pickpocketing, whoring, drinking, masquerade – people dressed up as the Archbishop of Canterbury and indulged in vulgar acts. It allowed people a space to free-up but it was banned for moral reasons and for the anti-authoritarian behaviour that went on like stoning of constables. Carnival allowed people to dramatise their grievances against the authorities on the street... Notting Hill Carnival single-handedly revived this tradition and is a great contribution to British cultural life.&quot;
This huge street festival attracts around one million people every year to Notting Hill and highlights Caribbean and Black diasporic cultures. Carnival uses influences from many other festivals around the world. Authors Julian Henriques and Beatrice Ferrara claim the festival draws mainly on the Trinidad Carnival as well as Crop Over, Canadian Caribana in Toronto and the US Labor Day Festival in Brooklyn. They also explain that Notting Hill Carnival is dually influenced by its diasporic cultures and its own country&#x27;s influences. Henriques and Ferrara claim: &quot;Carnival also has an explosive auditory impact due to its cacophony of sounds, in which soca, steel bands, calypso floats and sound systems mix and mingle in a multi-media and multi-sensory event&quot; (Ferrara 132).

This mixture of percussion, with emphasis on the beat and rhythm, leads to the extreme dancing in the streets for which Carnival is known, with citizens participating to the beat of the music, using mud and paint, dancing with the lower parts of the body. Henriques and Ferrara explain that people emphasize the &quot;baseness&quot; of the music, with everything being about the &quot;bottom&quot;: the ground, the bottom of the body, and the bottom of the beat. The festival uses influences from the Jamaican dancehalls and British clubs, and the music is made loud enough for participants to feel the beat. The vibrations from the speakers allow people to better connect with the ground and bring their experience to another level.

The authors of the same article further explain how Notting Hill Carnival also creates &quot;territory&quot;. The parade route portion of the Carnival is where carnival floats play both recorded and live music and circulate the street, visualizing the boundaries of Carnival and marking its territory. The circulating movement of the Carnival parade is also an extending of space through sound. Territorializing the space through sounds of African beats, such as the pan, fosters a sense of identity and unity for the overall Carnival.

== Artists ==
Many carnival artists who created costumes and floats for bands and Samba Schools have left their mark, among them: Clary Salandy of Mohogany Carnival, Carl Gabriel and Ray Mahabir.

== Media coverage ==
Compared to other major music and art events such as Glastonbury Festival, Notting Hill Carnival has historically struggled to gain any live coverage outside of local media. The majority of carnival live broadcasts have been traditionally on BBC London radio (hitting a peak of coverage in the years of 2003 and 2004), and on BBC Radio 1Xtra in more recent years.

== Public order ==
Since the carnival did not have local authority permission, initial police involvement was aimed at preventing it taking place at all, which resulted in regular confrontation and riots. In 1976, the police had been expecting hostility due to what they deemed as trouble the year before. Consequently, after discovering pickpockets in the crowd, police took a heavy-handed approach against the large congregation of black people and it became &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot;. The 1600-strong police force violently broke up the carnival, with the arrest of 60 people. In the aftermath of the event, the carnival was portrayed in a very pointed way, with those aiding the riots lumped together as the &quot;trouble-makers&quot; responsible.

After the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival the Police Federation pressed for the introduction of riot shields to protect police from objects thrown at them, although the shields also had the potential for aggressive use, as in 1977.
A change of policy came after a confrontation in 1987, when the Carnival was allowed to take place with police adopting a more conciliatory approach. During the 2000 Carnival, two men were murdered; and future policing, while conciliatory, resulted in police deployment in large numbers: upwards of 11,000.

The Mayor of London&#x27;s Carnival Review Group&#x27;s report (published in 2004,) led to the parades taking a circular rather than linear route, but a recommendation to relocate the event in Hyde Park has been resisted. Some crimes associated with the carnival have taken place on its periphery: in 2007, two teenagers were wounded in separate shooting incidents just outside the carnival area on the Monday evening; however, police said there had been a decline in the number of carnival-linked arrests in comparison with the previous year.

The 2008 Carnival was marred by rioting at the very end of the weekend, involving about 40 youths battling with police, and more than 300 people were arrested. The carnival has come under criticism for its cost to the London taxpayer, with the cost of policing the event more than £6,000,000; however, it is argued that this should be put into context since the carnival is estimated to bring approximately £93,000,000 into the local economy.

Although the 2011 Carnival was at risk of being cancelled in the wake of the early August riots in the UK that year, it was seen as being relatively peaceful. Five people were arrested for a stabbing at Ladbroke Grove. The victim was one of 86 people who were taken to hospital. In total 245 people were detained by police over the two days of the carnival.

In recent years, there has been much less serious trouble, and it is generally viewed very positively by the authorities as a dynamic celebration of London&#x27;s multicultural diversity, though dominated by the Caribbean culture. However, there has been controversy over the public safety aspects of holding such a well-attended event in narrow streets in a small area of London. In 2017, local Conservative MP Victoria Borwick commissioned a survey of Kensington and Chelsea residents, with the Evening Standard reporting that &quot;Nine out of ten residents living along the route of the Notting Hill Carnival flee their homes to escape the &#x27;frightening and intimidating&#x27; event.&quot;

In 2016 there were over 450 arrests, and five people were hurt in four knife attacks; however, the commander in charge of policing carnival, David Musker, said that the number of arrests had been inflated by the new Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. Based on relative attendance figures, it has been said that crime rates for the Notting Hill Carnival and for Glastonbury or other music festivals are comparable, and Ishmahil Blagrove, co-author of the book &quot;Carnival: A Photographic and Testimonial History of the Notting Hill Carnival&quot;, states: &quot;Notting Hill Carnival, compared to Trinidad or Brazil, is one of the safest in the world.&quot;

A report in 2004 by the GLA Policing Policy Director, Lee Jasper, criticised authorities for not addressing safety issues involved in over a million people attending a small inner-city residential area, quoting the Met Police spokesman Dave Musker, who in November 2016 said: &quot;Each year … we come exceptionally close to a major catastrophic failure of public safety where members of the public will suffer serious injury.&quot;

In the three weeks running up to the 2017 event, the police made 656 arrests, a pre-emptive crackdown. There were 313 arrests during the two days of the 2017 Carnival, compared with 454 the previous year. On both days, a minute&#x27;s silence in tribute to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire was observed at 3 pm by Carnival-goers, many of whom wore &quot;green for Grenfell&quot;.

During the 2018 event, due to the rising levels of violent crime in London, police deployed metal detectors to prevent weapons being brought to the event. During the event, 30 police officers were injured in the line of duty, 36 weapons were confiscated and 373 arrests were made by the Metropolitan Police Service.

Since 1987 there have been eight deaths related to violence at carnival: Michael Augustine Galvin (23) on 30 August 1987, Nicholas John Hanscomb (38) on 26 August 1991, Greg Fitzgerald Watson (21) on 28 August 2000, Abdul Munam Bhatti (28) on 28 August 2000, Lee Christopher Surbaran (27) on 30 August 2004, Takayo Nembhard (also known as rapper TKorStretch, 21) on 29 August 2022 and two deaths during NHC 2024 - a 32-year-old female who was stabbed and a 41-year-old male who was assaulted.

During the 2024 Festival, 334 people were arrested and eight people were stabbed, with three left with life-threatening conditions. Two people died following two separate attacks during the carnival.

Despite its reputation for crime, Notting Hill Carnival arrests as a proportion of attendance is comparable to many other large events and festivals in the UK.

== Transport ==

<text>PAVE PAWS (PAVE Phased Array Warning System) is a complex Cold War early warning radar and computer system developed in 1980 to &quot;detect and characterize a sea-launched ballistic missile attack against the United States&quot;. The first solid-state phased array deployed used a pair of Raytheon AN/FPS-115 phased array radar sets at each site to cover an azimuth angle of 240 degrees. In accordance with the Joint Electronics Type Designation System, the &quot;AN/FPS-115&quot; designation represents the 115th design of an Army-Navy fixed radar(pulsed) electronic device for searching. Two sites were deployed in 1980 at the periphery of the contiguous United States, then two more in 1987–95 as part of the United States Space Surveillance Network. One system was sold to Taiwan and is still in service.

== Mission ==

The radar was built in the Cold War to give early warning of a nuclear attack, to allow time for US bombers to get off the ground and land-based US missiles to be launched, to decrease the chance that a preemptive strike could destroy US strategic nuclear forces. The deployment of submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) by the Soviet Union by the 1970s, significantly decreased the warning time available between the detection of an incoming enemy missile and its reaching its target, because SLBMs can be launched closer to the US than the previous ICBMs, which have a long flight path from the Soviet Union to the continental US. Thus there was a need for a radar system with faster reaction time than existing radars. PAVE PAWS later acquired a second mission of tracking satellites and other objects in Earth orbit as part of the United States Space Surveillance Network.

A notable feature of the system is its phased array antenna technology, it was one of the first large phased array radars. A phased array was used because a conventional mechanically-rotated radar antenna cannot turn fast enough to track multiple ballistic missiles. A nuclear strike on the US would consist of hundreds of ICBMs and SLBMs incoming simultaneously. The beam of the phased array radar is steered electronically without moving the fixed antenna, so it can be pointed in a different direction in milliseconds, allowing it to track many incoming missiles at the same time.

== Description ==
The AN/FPS-115 radar consists of two phased arrays of antenna elements mounted on two sloping sides of the 105 ft high transmitter building, which are oriented 120° apart in azimuth. The beam from each array can be deflected up to 60° from the array&#x27;s central boresight axis, allowing each array to cover an azimuth angle of 120°, thus the entire radar can cover an azimuth of 240°. The building sides are sloped at an angle of 20°, and the beam can be directed at any elevation angle between 3° and 85°. The beam is kept at least 100 ft above the ground over public-accessible land to avoid the possibility of exposing the public to significant electromagnetic fields.

Each array is a circle 72.5 ft (22.1 m) in diameter consisting of 2,677 crossed dipole antenna elements, of which 1,792 are powered and serve as both transmitting and receiving antennas, with the rest functioning as receiving antennas. Due to the phenomenon of interference the radio waves from the separate elements combine in front of the antenna to form a beam. The array has a gain of 38.6 dB, and the width of the beam is only 2.2°. The drive current for each antenna element passes through a device called a phase shifter, controlled by the central computer. By changing the relative timing (phase) of the current pulses supplied to each antenna element the computer can instantly steer the beam to a different direction.

The radar operates in the UHF band between 420 - 450 MHz, which is shared with the 70 centimeter amateur band (just below the UHF television broadcast band), that is a wavelength of 71–67 cm, with circular polarization. It is an active array (AESA); each of the 1,792 transmitting elements has its own solid-state transmitter/receiver module, and radiates a peak power of 320 W, so the peak power of each array is 580 kW. It operates in a repeating 54 millisecond cycle in which it transmits a series of pulses, then listens for echoes. Its duty cycle (fraction of time spent transmitting) is never greater than 25% (so the average power of the beam never exceeds 25% of 580 kW, or 145 kW) and is usually around 18%. It is reported to have a range of about 3,000 nautical miles (3,452 statute miles, 5,555 km); at that range it can detect an object the size of a small car, and smaller objects at closer ranges.

The functioning of the radar is completely automatic, controlled by four computers. The software divides the beam time between &quot;surveillance&quot; and &quot;tracking&quot; functions, switching the beam back and forth rapidly between different tasks. In the surveillance mode, which normally consumes about 11% of the duty cycle, the radar repeatedly scans the horizon across its full 240° azimuth in a pattern between 3° and 10° elevation, creating a &quot;surveillance fence&quot; to immediately detect missiles as they rise above the horizon into the radar&#x27;s field of view. In the tracking mode, which normally consumes the other 7% of the 18% duty cycle, the radar beam follows already-detected objects to determine their trajectory, calculating their launch and target points.

== Background ==

Fixed-reflector radars with mechanically-scanned beams such as the 1955 GE AN/FPS-17 Fixed Ground Radar and 1961 RCA AN/FPS-50 Radar Set were deployed for missile tracking, and the USAF tests of modified AN/FPS-35 mechanical radars at Virginia and Pennsylvania SAGE radar stations had &quot;marginal ability&quot; to detect Cape Canaveral missiles in summer 1962. A Falling Leaves mechanical radar in New Jersey built for BMEWS successfully tracked a missile during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and &quot;an AN/FPS-85 long-range phased array (Passive electronically scanned array) radar was constructed at Eglin AFB&quot; Site C-6, Florida beginning on 29 October 1962 (the Bendix Radio Division FPS-85 contract had been signed 2 April 1962). Early military phased array radars were also deployed for testing: Bendix AN/FPS-46 Electronically Steerable Array Radar (ESAR) at Towson, MD (powered up in November 1960), White Sands&#x27; Multi-function Array Radar (1963), and the Kwajalein Missile Site Radar (1967).

=== Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile Detection and Warning System ===
The Avco 474N Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM) Detection and Warning System (SLBMD&amp;W System) was deployed as &quot;an austere…interim line-of-sight system&quot; after approval in July 1965 to modify some Air Defense Command (ADC) Avco AN/FPS-26 Frequency Diversity Radars into Avco AN/FSS-7 SLBM Detection Radars. The 474N sites planned for 1968 also were to include AN/GSQ-89 data processing equipment (for synthesizing tracks from radar returns), as well as site communications equipment that NORAD requested on 10 May 1965 to allow &quot;dual full period dedicated data circuits&quot; to the Cheyenne Mountain 425L System, which was &quot;fully operational&quot; on 20 April 1966. (Cheyenne Mountain Complex relayed 474N data to &quot;SAC, the National Military Command Center, and the Alternate NMCC over BMEWS circuits&quot;, for presentation by Display Information Processors—impact ellipses and &quot;threat summary display&quot; with a count of incoming missiles and &quot;Minutes Until First Impact&quot; countdown).

By December 1965 NORAD decided to use the Project Space Track &quot;phased-array radar at Eglin AFB…for SLBM surveillance on an &quot;on-call&quot; basis&quot; &quot;at the appropriate DEFCON&quot;. By June 1966 the refined FPS-85 plan was for it &quot;to have the capability to operate in the SLBM mode [interlaced transmissions] with the Spacetrack surveillance and tracking modes&quot; Rebuilding of the &quot;separate faces for transmitting and receiving&quot; began in 1967 after the under-construction Eglin FPS-85 was &quot;almost totally destroyed by fire on 5 January 1965&quot;. FPS-85 IOC was in 1969, 474N interim operations began in July 1970 (474N IOC was 5 May 1972), and in 1972 20% of Eglin FPS-85 &quot;surveillance capability…became dedicated to search for SLBMs,&quot; and new SLBM software was installed in 1975. (the FPS-85 was expanded in 1974).

The Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex with North Dakota phased arrays (four-face Missile Site Radar and single-face GE Perimeter Acquisition Radar, PAR) became operational in 1975 as part of the Safeguard Program for defending against enemy ballistic missiles.

== Development ==

The SLBM Phased Array Radar System (SPARS) was the USAF program initiated in November 1972 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) while the Army&#x27;s PAR was under construction. A 1974 SPARS proposal for &quot;two new SLBM Phased Array Warning Radars&quot; was submitted to replace the east/west coast 474N detection radars, which had &quot;limitations against Soviet SLBMs, particularly the longer range SS-N-8&quot; on 1973 &quot;Delta&quot; class submarines. Development began in August 1973, SPARS was renamed PAVE PAWS on 18 February 1975, and system production was requested by a 13 June 1975 Request for Proposals (RFP). Rome Air Development Center (RADC) &quot;was responsible for the design, fabrication installation, integration test, and evaluation of&quot; PAVE PAWS through 1980.

The differing USAF AN/FPS-109 Cobra Dane phased array radar in Alaska achieved IOC on 13 July 1977 for &quot;providing intelligence on Soviet test missiles fired at the Kamchatka peninsula from locations in southwestern Russia&quot;. The Safeguard PAR station that closed in 1976, had its radar &quot;modified for the ADCOM mission during 1977 [and] ADCOM accepted [the Concrete Missile Early Warning Station] from the Army on 3 October 1977&quot; for &quot;SLBM surveillance of Arctic Ocean areas&quot;. By December 1977 RADC had developed the 322 watt PAVE PAWS &quot;solid state transmitter and receiver module&quot;, and the System Program Office (ESD/OCL) issued the AN/FPS-115 &quot;System Performance Specification …SS-OCLU-75-1A&quot; on 15 December 1977. IBM&#x27;s PAVE PAWS &quot;beam-steering and pulse schedules from the CYBER-174&quot; duplexed computers to the MODCOMP IV duplexed radar control computers were &quot;based upon&quot; PARCS program(s) installed for attack characterization in 1977 when the USAF received the Army&#x27;s PAR. Bell Labs enhanced the PARCS beginning December 1978, e.g., &quot;extending the range&quot; by 1989 for the Enhanced PARCS configuration (EPARCS).

== Environmental and health concerns ==
USAF environmental assessments in August 1975 and March 1976 for PAVE PAWS were followed by the EPA&#x27;s Environmental Impact Analysis in December 1977. Environmental impacts were litigated in U.S. District Court in Boston. The government asserted the position that PAVE PAWS would protect the American coastline, while hiding the fact that it had no defensive armaments in the event an incoming missile was detected. The USAF requested the National Research Council (in May 1978) and a contractor, SRI International (April 1978), to assess PAVE PAWS radiation. Two NRC reports were prepared (1979, tbd), SRI&#x27;s Environmental Impact Statement was reviewed during a 22 January 1979 public hearing at the Sandwich MA high school auditorium (~300 people). The studies found no elevated cancer risk from PAVE PAWS e.g., elevated Ewing sarcoma rates were not supported by 2005 available data (a December 2007 MA Department of Health report concluded it &quot;appears unlikely that PAVE PAWS played a primary role in the incidence of Ewing family of tumors on Cape Cod.&quot;) A followup to a 1978 Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine report concluded in 2005 that power densities beyond were within permissible exposure limits. Consistent with other regulations to prevent interference with aircraft systems, the FAA restricts aircraft at altitudes below to maintain 1 nm (1.85 km) from the Cape Cod SSPARS phased array.

== Deployment ==

On May 23, 1975 the USAF announced the Raytheon Corporation would be contracted to build the East Coast facility in Otis Air Force Base and West Coast facility in Beale Air Force Base. On October 27, 1976, ground-breaking ceremonies were held at the East Coast Site.

System performance testing at the Otis facility began on April 3, 1978 and completed by January 16, 1979. To mitigate interference at the FPS-115 site on Flatrock Hill from the Cape &amp; Islands Emergency Medical Service (CIEMSS), on 8 February 1979 ESD installed six high pass filters—then Raytheon was contracted 24 May to move the EMS Repeater Station to Bourne, Massachusetts (completed 13 July). After a 5–7 March &quot;final review of the East Coast PAVE PAWS EIS was held at Hq AFSC&quot;, the site was accepted by ESD on 12 April. The &quot;first radio frequency transmission&quot; from the West Coast Site was 23 March 1979 (it was completed in October 1979). &quot;ADCOM wanted four [PAVE PAWS] sites, but by the end of 1979 only two had been funded&quot;.

The Cape Cod system reached Initial operating capability (IOC) as the Cape Cod Missile Early Warning Station on 4 April 1981 with initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) completed 21 May; Beale AFB reached IOC on 15 August. The two PAVE PAWS, three BMEWS, and the PARCS &amp; FPS-85 radar stations transferred to Strategic Air Command (then Space Command) in 1983. By 1981 Cheyenne Mountain was providing 6,700 messages per hour including those based on input from the PAVE PAWS and the remaining FSS-7 stations. In 1981, as part of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System Information System (WIS), the Pentagon&#x27;s National Military Command Center was receiving data &quot;directly from the Satellite Early Warning System (SEWS) and directly from the PAVE PAWS sensor systems&quot;.

Beam Steering Unit (BSU) and Receiver Beam Former (REX) replacements were made on the four Cape Cod and Beale radars in the 1980s.

== Expansion ==
The PAVE PAWS Expansion Program had begun by February 1982 to replace &quot;older FPS-85 and FSS-7 SLBM surveillance radars in Florida with a new PAVE PAWS radar to provide improved surveillance of possible SLBM launch areas southeast of the United States [and for another] to the Southwest.&quot; After a 3 June 1983 RFP, Raytheon Company was contracted on 10 November and had a 22–23 February 1984 System Design Review for the Southeast and Southwest radars. The Expansion&#x27;s Development Test and Engineering testing commenced on 3 February 1986 at the Southeast Site (PAVE PAWS Site 3, Robins Air Force Base—completed 5 June) and 15 August at the Southwest Site (PAVE PAWS Site 4, Eldorado Air Force Station). The Gulf Coast FPS-115s were operational in 1986 (Robins) and May 1987 (Eldorado IOC). In February 1995, all 4 radars were being netted by the &quot;missile warning center at Cheyenne Mountain AS [which was] undergoing a $450 million upgrade program&quot;. Other centers receiving PAVE PAWS output were the 19xx Missile Correlation Center and 19xx Space Control Center.

During the post-Cold War draw down, the Eldorado and Robins radar stations closed in 1995. By October 1999, Cape Cod and Beale radars were providing data via Jam Resistant Secure Communication (JRSC) circuits to the Command Center Processing and Display System in the NMCC. The transition of BMEWS and PAVE PAWS to SSPARS had begun with the 4 AN/FPS-50 BMEWS radars near Thule Air Base being replaced with a Raytheon AN/FPS-120 Solid State Phased Array Radar at Thule Site J (operational &quot;2QFY87&quot;).

== In Taiwanese service ==
An AN/FPS-115 system was sold to Taiwan in 2000 and installed at Loshan or Leshan Mountain, Tai&#x27;an, Miaoli in 2006. It was commissioned into service in 2013. The system cost approximately US$1.4 billion and Raytheon was the prime contractor. It provides up to six minutes notice of Chinese ballistic missile attack. The system spends most of its time observing satellites and orbital debris; this information is shared with the United States. In 2016 Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems was awarded a $26.2 million contract to upgrade Taiwan&#x27;s radar system. This followed on a $289.5 million sustainment contract which Raytheon was awarded in 2012. It has been reported that the defenses of Taiwan&#x27;s PAVE PAWS system include a land based Phalanx CIWS.

Taiwan had explored the acquisition of a second PAVE PAWS set but in 2012 decided against the purchase as the first PAVE PAWS set was significantly over budget and behind schedule. The second system would have been located in the south and together the PAVE PAWS sets would have provided Taiwan with 360-degree coverage.

The radar site in Taiwan sits on top of a mountain at an elevation of over 2,600 m (8,500 ft). Due to its extremely elevated position the Taiwanese set has the unique ability to track surface ships. Detection and tracking data is believed to be shared with the United States in real time; this has not been officially confirmed.

The radar site was first occupied by a Naval Maritime and Surveillance Command radar surveillance facility, which was relocated to a higher peak in the same region to make way for PAVE PAWS.

== Replacement ==

The Solid State Phased Array Radar System (SSPARS) began replacing PAVE PAWS when the first AN/FPS-115 face was taken off-line for the radar upgrade. New Raytheon AN/FPS-123 Early Warning Radars became operational in 19xx (Beale) and 19xx (Cape Cod) in each base&#x27;s existing PAVE PAWS &quot;Scanner Building&quot;. RAF Fylingdales, UK and Clear Space Force Station, Alaska BMEWS stations became SSPARS radar stations when their respective AN/FPS-126 radar (3 faces) and 2001 Raytheon AN/FPS-120 Solid State Phased Array Radar became operational. In 2007, 100 owners/trustees of amateur radio repeaters in the 420 to 450 MHz band near AN/FPS-123 radars were notified to lower their power output to mitigate interference, and AN/FPS-123s were part of the Air Force Space Surveillance System by 2009. The Beale AN/FPS-123 was upgraded to a Raytheon AN/FPS-132 Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR), circa 2012, with capabilities to operate in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) ABM system—the Beale UEWR included Avionics, Transmit-Receive modules, Receiver Exciter / Test Target Generator, Beam Steering Generator, Signal Processor, and other changes. After additional UEWR installations for GMD at Thule Site J and the UK (contracted 2003), a 2012 ESD/XRX Request for Information for replacement, and remote operation, of the remaining &quot;PAVE PAWS/BMEWS/PARCS systems&quot; at Cape Cod, Alaska, and North Dakota was issued. The Alaska AN/FPS-132 was contracted in fall 2012 and in 2013, the U.S. announced a plan to sell an AN/FPS-132 to Qatar.

<text>Stonařov (); ) is a market town in Jihlava District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 1,100 inhabitants.

==Administrative division==
Stonařov consists of two municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):
*Stonařov (1,065)
*Sokolíčko (5)

==Geography==
Stonařov is located about south of Jihlava. It lies in the Křižanov Highlands. The highest point is at above sea level. The Jihlávka Stream flows through the market town. The municipal territory is rich in small fishponds. The pond Dolní Jarošův rybník is located inside the built-up area.

==History==
The first written mention of Stonařov is from 1347. The settlement was established in the early 13th century. In 1367 it received market town privileges.

Peasant rebellions in 1712–1722 were suppressed. The main trade and post road between Prague and Vienna built in 1750 went through Stonařov. On 22 May 1808 the place was hit by the Stannern meteorite.

Agriculture and small-scale textile production were the main sources of income, though at the end of the 19th century two textile manufacturies were built here. The municipality was damaged by large fires in 1900 and 1901. Before World War I the place was a target of tourists from Vienna. German-speaking inhabitants were expelled after the end of World War II.

==Demographics==
==Transport==
The I/38 road (part of the European route E59) from Jihlava to Znojmo passes through Stonařov.

==Sights==
The main landmark of Stonařov is the Church of Saint Wenceslaus. It has a Gothic core from the 13th century. The original church was rebuilt in the Renaissance style in 1591. The nave was later rebuilt in the Baroque style, but the tower remained Renaissance. Part of the church is a unique Romanesque charnel house from the mid-13th century.

==Honours==
The asteroid 61208 Stonařov was named after the market town on 1 June 2007.

==Notable people==
*Arthur Seyss-Inquart (1892–1946), Austrian Nazi politician

<text>The Grenadines () is a chain of small islands that lie on a line between the larger islands of Saint Vincent and Grenada in the Lesser Antilles. Nine are inhabited and open to the public (or ten, if the offshore island of Young Island is counted): Bequia, Mustique, Canouan, Union Island, Petit St Vincent, Palm Island and Mayreau, all in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, plus Petite Martinique and Carriacou in Grenada. Several additional privately owned islands, such as Calivigny, are also inhabited. Notable uninhabited islands of the Grenadines include Petit Nevis, used by whalers, and Petit Mustique, which was the centre of a prominent real estate scam in the early 2000s.

The northern two-thirds of the chain, including about 32 islands and cays, is part of the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The southern third of the chain belongs to the country of Grenada. Carriacou is the largest and most populous of the Grenadines.

==Geographic boundaries==
The islands are politically divided between the island nations of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada. They lie between the islands of Saint Vincent in the north and Grenada in the south. Neither Saint Vincent nor Grenada are Grenadine islands. The islands north of the Martinique Channel belong to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and the islands south of the channel belong to Grenada.

==History==
The history of the Grenadines is not well studied due to their relative lack of geopolitical importance, the paucity of original documents and lack of serious research. The islands were sparsely populated by the Caribs, who used them mainly for fishing and food gathering. When the French claimed Grenada in 1650, the Grenadines were included (St Vincent to the north remained Carib country). Because of their small size, dangerous reefs and lack of fresh water, the French used them mainly for fishing, turtle catching and lime-making. They were also used by smugglers and pirates. Permanent settlements began about 1740. When the British took over in 1762 there were a fair number of French plantations on Bequia and Carriacou. In 1791 the islands were divided between Grenada and Saint Vincent.

==Larger islands of the Grenadines==
===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
The total population of the Grenadine islands within Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is estimated to be 10,234. The following islands make up the Grenadines Parish:

===Grenada===
Carriacou and Petite Martinique is a dependency of Grenada and has a population of 10,900 people. Carriacou is the largest of the Grenadine chain. These islands contain:

<doc id="241113" wikidata="Q313481" url="?curid=241113" title="Dikembe Mutombo">
<text>Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean-Jacques Wamutombo (June 25, 1966 – September 30, 2024) was a Congolese-American professional basketball player. He played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed &quot;Mount Mutombo&quot; for his defensive prowess, he is commonly regarded as one of the best shot-blockers and defensive players of all time. Outside of basketball, he was known for his humanitarian work.

A center, Mutombo moved to the United States from the Democratic Republic of the Congo at age 21 to attend Georgetown University with the hope of eventually earning a medical degree and returning to the DRC to practice medicine. Those plans changed when John Thompson, coach of the Georgetown Hoyas, recruited him to play college basketball. Mutombo played three seasons for Georgetown, establishing a reputation as a tenacious defender.

In 1991 the Denver Nuggets chose him with the fourth overall pick of the NBA draft. During his NBA career, he played for six teams, in the NBA Finals for the Philadelphia 76ers in 2001 and for the New Jersey Nets in 2003. He received the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award four times, tied with Ben Wallace and Rudy Gobert for the most awards. He led the NBA in blocked shots three times, led the league in rebounds twice, and was named to eight All-Star teams. As of the 2023-2024 NBA season, he ranks second among NBA career leaders in blocked shots.

At the conclusion of the 2009 NBA playoffs, Mutombo retired and his number 55 jersey was retired by the Nuggets and Atlanta Hawks. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.

==Early life==
Dikembe Mutombo Mpolondo Mukamba Jean-Jacques Wamutombo was born on June 25, 1966, in Léopoldville (now known as Kinshasa), Democratic Republic of the Congo to Samuel and Biamba Marie Mutombo. Dikembe had 9 siblings. His father worked as a school principal and then in Congo&#x27;s department of education. Dikembe spoke French, Spanish, Portuguese and five Central African languages including Lingala and Tshiluba. He was a member of the Luba ethnic group.

For high school, Dikembe Mutombo went to Boboto College in Kinshasa to lay the groundwork for his medical career as the classes were more challenging there. He played football and participated in martial arts. At about 16, Mutombo decided to concentrate on his basketball career at the encouragement of his father and brother due to his height. He moved to the United States in 1987 at the age of 21 to enroll in college.

==College career==
Mutombo attended Georgetown University on a USAID scholarship. He originally intended to become a doctor, but the Georgetown Hoyas basketball coach John Thompson recruited him to play basketball. He spoke almost no English when he arrived at Georgetown and studied in the ESL program.

During his first year of college basketball as a sophomore, Mutombo once blocked 12 shots in a game. Building on the shot-blocking power of Mutombo and teammate Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown fans created a &quot;Rejection Row&quot; section under the basket, adding a big silhouette of an outstretched hand to a banner for each shot blocked during the game. Mutombo was named the Big East Defensive Player of the Year twice, in 1990 (shared with Mourning) and in 1991.

At Georgetown, Mutombo&#x27;s international background and interests stood out. Like many other Washington-area college students, he served as a summer intern, once for Robert Matsui, a member of the Congress of the United States from California, and once at the World Bank. In 1991, he graduated with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in linguistics and diplomacy.

==Professional athletic career==
===Denver Nuggets (1991–1996)===
In the 1991 NBA draft, the Denver Nuggets selected Mutombo with the fourth overall pick. The Nuggets ranked last in the NBA in opponent points-per-game and Defensive Rating, and Mutombo&#x27;s shot-blocking ability made an immediate impression across the league. He developed his signature move, in which he would celebrate every blocked shot by pointing his right index finger at the opposing player and moving it side to side, in 1992 as a way to become more marketable and gain product-endorsement contracts. That year, Mutombo starred in an Adidas advertisement that used the catchphrase &quot;Man does not fly ... in the house of Mutombo&quot;, a reference to his prolific shot-blocking.

As a rookie, Mutombo was selected for the All-Star team and averaged 16.6 points, 12.3 rebounds and nearly three blocks per game. Mutombo quickly began to establish himself as one of the league&#x27;s best defensive players, regularly putting up big rebound and block numbers.

The 1993–94 season saw Denver continue to improve with Mutombo as the franchise cornerstone. During that season, Mutombo averaged 12.0 points per game, 11.8 rebounds per game and 4.1 blocks per game. With that, he helped the Nuggets finish with a 42–40 record and qualify as the eighth seed in the playoffs. They were matched up with the top-seeded 63–19 Seattle SuperSonics in the first round.

After falling to an 0–2 deficit in the five-game series, Denver won three straight games to pull off a major playoff upset, becoming the first eighth seed to defeat a number one seed in an NBA playoff series. At the end of Game 5, Mutombo memorably grabbed the game-winning rebound and fell to the ground, holding the ball over his head in a moment of joy. Mutombo&#x27;s defensive presence was the key to the upset victory; his total of 31 blocks remains a record for a five-game series. In the second round of the playoffs, the Nuggets fell to the Utah Jazz, 4–3.

The next season, Mutombo was selected for his second All-Star game and received the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. Denver failed to build on its success from the previous playoffs, as Mutombo lacked a quality supporting cast around him.

During his last season with the Nuggets, Mutombo averaged 11.0 points per game, 11.8 rebounds per game and a career-high 4.5 blocks per game. At the conclusion of the 1995–96 season, Mutombo became a free agent, and reportedly sought a ten-year contract, something the Nuggets considered impossible to offer. Bernie Bickerstaff, then the Nuggets&#x27; general manager, later said not bringing back Mutombo was his biggest regret as GM.

===Atlanta Hawks (1996–2001)===
After the 1995–96 NBA season, Mutombo signed a five-year, $55 million free agent contract with the Atlanta Hawks. He and Hawks All-Star Steve Smith led Atlanta to back-to-back 50+-win seasons in 1996–97 (56–26) and 1997–98 (50–32). Mutombo won Defensive Player of the Year both years, continuing to put up excellent defensive numbers with the Hawks.

In the 1997 NBA Playoffs, the Hawks defeated the Detroit Pistons in five games. In Game 1 of that series, Mutombo led all scorers and rebounders, with 26 points and 15 rebounds respectively, in a 89–75 win over the Pistons. In the next round, despite Mutombo averaging a double-double and 2.6 blocks per game, the Hawks lost in five games to the defending champion Chicago Bulls.

The following season, on April 9, 1998, Mutombo scored 20 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 105–102 loss to the Indiana Pacers. That season ended in disappointment for Mutombo and the Hawks, as despite finishing with a similar record to the previous season, Mutombo averaged only 8.0 points and 12.8 rebounds a game while the Hawks lost to their division rival Charlotte Hornets three games to one in the first round.

During the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, he was the NBA&#x27;s IBM Award winner, a player of the year award determined by a computerized formula. That year, the NBA banned the Mutombo finger wag, and after a period of protest, he complied with the new rule.

In his last full season with the Hawks during the 1999–00 season, Mutombo averaged 11.5 points per game, a career and league-high 14.1 rebounds per game and 3.3 blocks per game. On December 14, 1999, Mutombo scored 27 points, on 11-for-11 shooting from the field, grabbed a season-high 29 rebounds and recorded a game-high six blocks to pull out the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.

===Philadelphia 76ers (2001–2002)===

At the February 2001 trade deadline, the Hawks traded Mutombo to the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia 76ers, along with Roshown McLeod, in exchange for Toni Kukoč, future teammates Pepe Sánchez and Nazr Mohammed, and injured center Theo Ratliff. One week earlier, Mutombo played in the All-Star game; he led the game with 22 rebounds and three blocks. Along with game MVP Allen Iverson and coach Larry Brown, both of the 76ers, the East rallied from a 95–74 fourth-quarter deficit to win 111–110 on Mutombo and Iverson&#x27;s strong performances.

After the game, rumors began of a trade sending Mutombo to Philadelphia. With Ratliff out for the remainder of the year, the Sixers needed a big man to compete with potential matchups against Western Conference powers Vlade Divac, Tim Duncan, David Robinson or Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, should they reach the NBA Finals.

Mutombo earned his fourth Defensive Player of the Year award that season. During the 2001 playoffs, they defeated the Indiana Pacers in four games, the Toronto Raptors in seven games and the Milwaukee Bucks in a seven-game series. During Game 7 against the Bucks, Mutombo scored 23 points, grabbed 19 rebounds and blocked seven shots to win the series. Mutombo helped the Sixers reach the NBA Finals. After pulling off an upset and winning Game 1 against the Los Angeles Lakers (the only playoff game the Lakers lost in 2001), the Sixers lost the next four games and the series. Matched up against Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Mutombo averaged 16.8 points, 12.2 rebounds and 2.2 blocks. A free agent, he re-signed with the Sixers after the season to a four-year, $68 million contract.

The 2001–02 season marked the final time in Mutombo&#x27;s career that he averaged double-digit points or rebounds, as he started 80 games for Philadelphia, although they lost in the first round of the playoffs.

===New Jersey Nets (2002–2003)===
On August 7, 2002, the 76ers traded Mutombo to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Keith Van Horn and Todd MacCulloch. The Nets were coming off a sweep in the Finals where they were overmatched by Shaq, and brought in Mutombo as the missing piece to a championship, similar to what the Sixers did two seasons prior.

Mutombo spent most of the season with a nagging wrist injury that limited him to 24 games. He was generally unable to play in the playoffs, typically serving as a sixth man during the Nets&#x27; second consecutive Finals run, in which they lost to the Spurs in six games. After one contentious season in New Jersey, the Nets bought out the remaining two years on his contract.

===New York Knicks (2003–2004)===
In October 2003, he signed a two-year deal with the New York Knicks. After a dominant performance against the crosstown rival New Jersey Nets that included 10 blocks, Knicks fans began waving their fingers, as Mutombo once did. He chose to respond in kind after a referee told him that as long as the gesture was not directed at a particular player, the league would not punish him. In August 2004, the Knicks traded him to the Chicago Bulls, along with Cezary Trybański, Othella Harrington and Frank Williams in exchange for Jerome Williams and Jamal Crawford.

===Houston Rockets (2004–2009)===
Prior to the 2004–05 season, the Bulls traded Mutombo to the Houston Rockets for Mike Wilks, Eric Piatkowski and Adrian Griffin. Yao Ming and Mutombo formed one of the NBA&#x27;s most productive center combos. In his first season with the Rockets, Mutombo averaged 15.2 minutes per game, 4.0 points per game, 5.3 rebounds per game and 1.3 blocks per game. The Rockets lost in the first round that year to the Dallas Mavericks.

On January 10, 2007, in a 102–77 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers, Mutombo recorded five blocked shots and surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in total career blocked shots, trailing only Hakeem Olajuwon.

On March 2, 2007, in a win over the Denver Nuggets at age 40, Mutombo became the oldest player in NBA history to record more than 20 rebounds in a game, with 22. In the 2007–08 season, Mutombo received extensive playing time when Yao went down with a broken bone and averaged double digits in rebounding as a starter. In midst of a 10-game winning streak at the time of Yao&#x27;s injury, Mutombo stepped in and helped the Rockets win 12 more games to complete a 22-game winning streak, then a team record.

After contemplating retirement and spending the first part of 2008 as an unsigned free agent, on December 31, 2008, Mutombo signed with the Houston Rockets for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. He said that 2009 would be his &quot;farewell tour&quot; and his final season; he was the oldest player in the NBA in 2009. In Game 1 of Houston&#x27;s first-round playoff series against Portland, Mutombo played for 18 minutes and had nine rebounds, two blocks and a steal.

In the second quarter of Game Two, Mutombo landed awkwardly and had to be carried from the floor. After the game, he said that surgery was needed and that his NBA career was over. It was later confirmed that the quadriceps tendon of his left knee had been ruptured. Mutombo announced his retirement on April 23, 2009, after 18 seasons in the NBA.

==Player profile==
The Mutombo played center, where he was regarded as one of the top inside defenders of all time. Nicknamed &quot;Mt. Mutombo&quot;, his combination of height, power and long arms led to a record-tying four NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards, a feat equaled only by Ben Wallace and Rudy Gobert. Mutombo was among the top three players in Defensive Player of the Year voting for nine consecutive seasons from 1994 to 2002. Staples of Mutombo&#x27;s defensive prowess were his outstanding shot-blocking and rebounding power. Over his career, he averaged 2.8 blocks and 10.3 rebounds per game. Mutombo blocked 3,289 shots; at the time of his death on September 30, 2024, he was second all-time in blocked shots behind Hakeem Olajuwon. Mutombo is the 20th-most-prolific rebounder ever. He was also an eight-time All-Star and was elected into three All-NBA and six All-Defensive Teams. Along with his defensive prowess, Mutombo also contributed offensively, averaging at least 10 points per game until he reached age 35.

Mutombo also achieved a certain level of on-court notoriety. After a successful block, he was known for taunting his opponents by waving his index finger, like a parent reproaching a disobedient child. Later in his career, NBA officials responded to the gesture with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. To avoid the technical foul, Mutombo took to waving his finger at the crowd or the TV cameras after a block, which is not considered taunting by the rules. Additionally, he was known for injuring several NBA players including Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Patrick Ewing, Chauncey Billups, Ray Allen, Yao Ming, LeBron James and Tracy McGrady due to his practice of flailing his elbows. His former teammate Yao Ming made a joke about it: &quot;I need to talk to Coach to have Dikembe held out of practice, because if he hits somebody in practice, it&#x27;s our teammate. At least in the games, it&#x27;s 50/50.&quot;

The Atlanta Hawks retired Mutombo&#x27;s number 55 jersey on November 24, 2015, and the Denver Nuggets did the same on October 29, 2016. On September 11, 2015, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He received the Sager Strong Award on June 25, 2018.

==Personal life==
In 1987, Mutombo&#x27;s older brother, Ilo, began playing college basketball in Division II for the Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles as a 26-year-old freshman. The brothers played against each other in a 1990 college basketball game at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland.

Mutombo met his wife, Rose, during a visit to Kinshasa in 1995. They lived in Atlanta and had three children. They also adopted four children of Rose&#x27;s deceased brothers. Dikembe and Rose&#x27;s son, Ryan Mutombo, was ranked as the 16th-best high school center in the United States. In 2021, he committed to attend his father&#x27;s alma mater Georgetown University in D.C. and play for its basketball team, which he did for two seasons.

Two of Mutombo&#x27;s nephews, Harouna Mutombo and Mfiondu Kabengele, have played professional basketball. Harouna Mutombo was the leading scorer at Western Carolina University for the Catamounts in 2009. He was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year; he later played professional basketball in Serbia. Mfiondu Kabengele played college basketball at Florida State University and was the 2018–19 ACC Sixth Man of the Year. He was selected in the first round of the 2019 NBA Draft and signed a contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. He played in the NBA for the Clippers, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics. Another of Mutombo&#x27;s nephews, Haboubacar Mutombo, also played basketball for Western Carolina. 

In July 2001, at the federal trial of an Atlanta club owner charged with facilitating prostitution, a former stripper testified that she and two others once performed oral sex on Mutombo at The Gold Club, a strip club.

Mutombo became a naturalized American citizen in 2006.

Mutombo witnessed the 2016 Brussels bombings at Brussels Airport on March 22, 2016. Shortly after the bombings, he posted a report on his Facebook page saying that he was safe.

===Death===
On October 15, 2022, Mutombo&#x27;s family announced that he was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. On September 30, 2024, Mutombo died due to brain cancer in Atlanta at the age of 58.

==Media==
Mutombo made a cameo appearance in the 2002 films &quot;Juwanna Mann&quot; and &quot;Like Mike&quot;, which mentioned his name in its theme song &quot;Basketball&quot;. In 2012, his voice and likeness were used in a 16-bit-style Flash game released by Old Spice humorously titled &quot;Dikembe Mutombo&#x27;s 4 1/2 Weeks to Save the World&quot;.

Mutombo appeared in a GEICO auto insurance commercial in February 2013, parodying his shot-blocking ability by applying it to real world situations. He co-starred with Kevin Harvick in a Mobil 1 commercial for its annual protection brand of motor oil, saying &quot;Don&#x27;t change your oil.&quot; Mutombo had a brief cameo in the 2021 film &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; as himself.

==Humanitarian work==
Dikembe Mutombo was a well-known humanitarian. He created the Dikembe Mutombo Foundation to improve living conditions in his native Democratic Republic of Congo in 1997. His work earned him the NBA&#x27;s J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 2001 and 2009. For his feats, &quot;Sporting News&quot; named him as one of the &quot;Good Guys in Sports&quot; in 1999 and 2000. In 1999, he was selected as one of 20 winners of the President&#x27;s Service Awards, the nation&#x27;s highest honor for volunteer service.

In 2004, he participated in the Basketball Without Borders NBA program, where NBA stars such as Shawn Bradley, Malik Rose and DeSagana Diop toured Africa to spread the word about basketball and to improve the infrastructure. He paid for uniforms and expenses for the Zaire women&#x27;s basketball team during the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. Mutombo was a spokesman for the international relief agency, CARE and was the first youth emissary for the United Nations Development Program.

Mutombo was a longtime supporter of Special Olympics and a member of the Special Olympics International Board of Directors, as well as a Global Ambassador. He was a pioneer of Unified Sports, which brings together people with and without intellectual disabilities. He played in the Unity Cup in South Africa before the 2010 World Cup Quarterfinal, along with South African President Jacob Zuma and Special Olympics athletes from around the world. Mutombo joined his second Unity Cup team in 2012.

Honoring his humanitarianism, Mutombo was invited to President George W. Bush&#x27;s 2007 State of the Union Address, where the president said &quot;We are proud to call this son of the Congo a citizen of the United States of America&quot;. Mutombo said, &quot;My heart was full of joy. I didn&#x27;t know the President was going to say such great remarks.&quot;

On April 13, 2011, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health gave Mutombo the Goodermote Humanitarian Award &quot;for his efforts to reduce polio globally as well as his work improving the health of neglected and underserved populations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&quot; Michael J. Klag, dean of the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said &quot;Mr. Mutombo is a winner in many ways—on the court and as a humanitarian. His work has improved the health of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital and Research Center is a model for the region. Likewise, Mr. Mutombo has been instrumental in the fight against polio by bolstering vaccination efforts and bringing treatment to victims of the disease.&quot;

In 2020, the Mutombo Foundation began construction of a modern pre-K through 6th-grade school in the Democratic Republic of Congo, named for his father, who died in 2003. The Samuel Mutombo Institute of Science &amp; Entrepreneurship is located outside the city of Mbuji-Mayi.

Mutombo was awarded an honorary doctorate by his alma mater Georgetown University in 2010. He also received an honorary doctorate from Haverford College in May 2011. In November 2015, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) announced Mutombo as a recipient of its Silver Anniversary Awards for 2016. The announcement cited both his basketball career and extensive humanitarian work.

In 1997, the Mutombo Foundation began plans to open a $29 million, 300-bed hospital on the outskirts of his hometown, the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. Ground was broken in 2001, but construction didn&#x27;t start until 2004, as he had trouble getting donations early on although he personally donated $3.5 million toward the hospital&#x27;s construction. Initially he had other difficulties and almost lost the land to the government because it was not being used and having to pay refugees who had begun farming the land to leave. Mutombo also struggled to reassure some that he did not have any ulterior or political motives for the project. The project has been on the whole very well received at all social and economic levels in Kinshasa. On August 14, 2006, Mutombo donated $15 million to the completion of the hospital for the ceremonial opening on September 2, 2006. By then it was named Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital, for his late mother, who died of a stroke in 1997. When it opened in 2007, the $29 million facility became the first modern medical facility to be built in that area in nearly 40 years. The hospital is on a site on the outskirts of Kinshasa in Masina, where about a quarter of the city&#x27;s 7.5 million residents live in poverty. It is near N&#x27;djili Airport and by a busy open-air market.

Mutombo served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, which is a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution.

In 2011, Mutombo traveled to South Sudan as a SportsUnited sports envoy for the US Department of State. He worked with Sam Perkins to lead a series of basketball clinics and team-building exercises with 50 youths and 36 coaches helping contribute to the State Department&#x27;s mission to remove barriers and create a world in which individuals with disabilities enjoy dignity and full inclusion in society.

In April 2020, Mutombo joined the website Ask the Doctor as their chief global officer. Ask the Doctor is a platform that connects people from all over the world to top doctors and healthcare professionals.

In 2021, he created an eponymous coffee company, initially focused on the Congo to foster women growers&#x27; participation in international commerce.

<text>The Quantock Hills west of Bridgwater in Somerset, England, consist of heathland, oak woodlands, ancient parklands and agricultural land. They were England&#x27;s first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, designated in 1956.

Natural England have designated the Quantock Hills as a national character area. They are entirely surrounded by another: the Vale of Taunton and Quantock Fringes.

The hills run from the Vale of Taunton Deane in the south, for about to the north-west, ending at Kilve and West Quantoxhead on the coast of the Bristol Channel. They form the western border of Sedgemoor and the Somerset Levels. From the top of the hills on a clear day, it is possible to see Glastonbury Tor and the Mendips to the east, Wales as far as the Gower Peninsula to the north, the Brendon Hills and Exmoor to the west, and the Blackdown Hills to the south. The highest point on the Quantocks is Wills Neck, at . Soil types and weather combine to support the hills&#x27; plants and animals. In 1970, an area of was designated as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Archaeological landscape features include Bronze Age round barrows, extensive ancient field systems and Iron Age hill forts. Roman silver coins have been discovered in West Bagborough. The hills are popular with walkers, mountain bikers, horse riders and tourists who explore paths such as the Coleridge Way.

==Etymology==
The name first appears in Saxon charters in around AD 880 as &quot;Cantuctun&quot; and two centuries later in the Domesday Book as &quot;Cantoctona&quot; and &quot;Cantetone&quot;. The name means &quot;settlement by a rim or circle of hills&quot;; &quot;Cantuc&quot; is Celtic for a rim or circle, and &quot;-ton&quot; or &quot;-tun&quot; is Old English for a settlement. The highest point of the hills is called Will&#x27;s Neck meaning &quot;ridge of the Welshman&quot;, probably referring to a time when the hills marked the boundary between the expanding Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the lands of the Britons or &#x27;Welsh&#x27; to the West. A battle was fought locally at that time.

==Geology==

The Quantock Hills are largely formed by rocks of the Devonian period, which consist of sediments originally laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north-western areas older Early Devonian rocks known as Hangman Grits (or, more formally, the Hangman Sandstone Formation) predominate and can be seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which was worked for road building. The Hangman Grits are described in three divisions: the lowest are the Little Quantock Beds, which are located near Crowcombe, and made up of siltstones and slates. Between Triscombe and West Quantoxhead is a layer of the Triscombe Beds which is around thick and is made up of green sandstone and mudstones. The uppermost division is the Hodders Combe Beds of sandstone and conglomerate and is approximately thick.

Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, is the only limestone cave in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger New Red Sandstone rocks of the Triassic period. These rocks were laid down in a shallow sea and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was mined on the foreshore at Watchet.

Several areas have outcrops of slates. Younger rocks of the Jurassic period can be found between St Audries and Kilve. This area falls within the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is considered to be of international geological importance.

Kilve has the remains of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found to be rich in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company&#x27;s retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.

At Blue Anchor the coloured alabaster found in the cliffs gave rise to the name of the colour &quot;Watchet Blue&quot;. The village has the only updraught brick kiln known to have survived in Somerset. It was built around 1830 and was supplied by small vessels carrying limestone to the small landing jetty. Now used as a garage, the kiln is thought to have operated until the 1870s, when the large-scale production of bricks in Bridgwater rendered small brickyards uneconomic.

Cockercombe tuff is a greenish-grey, hard pyroclastic rock formed by the compression of volcanic ash and is found almost exclusively in the south-eastern end of the Quantock Hills.

==Climate==

Along with the rest of South West England, the Quantock Hills has a temperate climate that is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean temperature is approximately and shows a seasonal and a diurnal variation, but because of the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around . December is normally the most cloudy month and June the sunniest. High pressure over the Azores often brings clear skies to south-west England, particularly in summer.

Cloud often forms inland especially near hills, and acts to reduce sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around . About 8 to 15 days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; winds are lightest from June to August. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Ecology==
In 1970 an area of in the Quantocks was designated as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). This a conservation designation denoting a protected area in the United Kingdom, selected by Natural England, for areas with particular landscape and ecological characteristics. It provides some protection from development, from other damage, and (since 2000) also from neglect, under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.

The streams and open water such as Hawkridge Reservoir and Ashford Reservoir on Cannington Brook also provide habitats for a range of species.

=== Flora===

The hilltops are covered in heathland of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The western side of the Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (&quot;Erica tetralix&quot;), purple moor-grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;), bilberry (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) and wavy hair-grass (&quot;Deschampsia flexuosa&quot;). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (&quot;Erica cinerea&quot;), western gorse (&quot;Ulex gallii&quot;) and bristle bent (&quot;Agrostis curtisii&quot;), while bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (&quot;Anagallis tenella&quot;). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen &quot;Tomasellia lectea&quot; is present.

===Fauna===
The various habitats, together with the wide range of slopes and aspects, provide ideal conditions
for a rich fauna. Amphibians including the palmate newt (&quot;Triturus helveticus&quot;), common frog (&quot;Rana temporaris&quot;), and common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;) are represented in the damper environments. Reptiles
present include adder (&quot;Vipera berus&quot;), grass snake (&quot;Natrix natrix&quot;), slowworm (&quot;Anguis fragilis&quot;) and common lizard (&quot;Lacerta vivipara&quot;). Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, including the grasshopper warbler (&quot;Locustella naevia&quot;), nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;), raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) and the European pied flycatcher (&quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot;). The Quantocks are also an important site for red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). Invertebrates of note include the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (&quot;Argynnis paphia&quot;), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: &quot;Thymalus limbatus&quot;, &quot;Orchesia undulata&quot; and &quot;Rhinosimus ruficollis&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
Evidence of activity in the Quantocks from prehistoric times includes finds of Mesolithic flints at North Petherton and Broomfield and many Bronze Age round barrows (marked on maps as &quot;tumulus&quot;, plural &quot;tumuli&quot;), such as Thorncombe Barrow above Bicknoller. Several ancient stones can be seen, such as the Triscombe Stone and the Long Stone above Holford. Many of the tracks along ridges of the Quantocks probably originated as ancient ridgeways. A Bronze Age hill fort, Norton Camp, was built to the south at Norton Fitzwarren, close to the centre of bronze making in Taunton.
Iron Age sites in the Quantocks include major hill forts at Dowsborough and Ruborough, as well as several smaller earthwork enclosures, such as Trendle Ring and Plainsfield Camp. Ruborough near Broomfield is on an easterly spur from the main Quantock ridge, with steep natural slopes to the north and south east. The fort is triangular in shape, with a single rampart and ditch (univallate), enclosing . A linear outer work about away, parallel to the westerly rampart, encloses another . The name &quot;Ruborough&quot; comes from &quot;Rugan beorh&quot; or &quot;Ruwan-beorge&quot; meaning &quot;Rough Hill&quot;. The Dowsborough fort has an oval shape, with a single rampart and ditch (&quot;univallate&quot;) following the contours of the hill top, enclosing an area of . The main entrance is to the east, towards Nether Stowey, with a simpler opening to the north west, aligned with a ridgeway leading down to Holford. A col to the south connects the hill to the main Stowey ridge, where a linear earthwork known as Dead Woman&#x27;s Ditch cuts across the spur.

Little evidence exists of Roman influence on the Quantock region beyond isolated finds and hints of transient forts. A Roman port was at Combwich, and it is possible that a Roman road ran from there to the Quantocks, because the names Nether Stowey and Over Stowey come from the Old English &quot;stan wey&quot;, meaning &quot;stone way&quot;. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century, and eight miliarense and 671 siliqua dating to 337–367 AD. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.

===Dark Ages and Anglo-Saxon===
The area remained under Romano-British Celtic control until 681–685 AD, when Centwine of Wessex pushed west from the River Parrett, conquered the Welsh King Cadwaladr, and occupied the rest of Somerset north to the Bristol Channel.
Saxon rule was later consolidated under King Ine, who established a fort at Taunton in about 700 AD.

The first documentary evidence of the village of Crowcombe is by Æthelwulf of Wessex in 854, where it was spelt &#x27;Cerawicombe&#x27;. At that time the manor belonged to Glastonbury Abbey. In the later Saxon period, King Alfred led the resistance to Viking invasion from Athelney, south-east of the Quantocks. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the early port at Watchet was plundered by Danes in 987 and 997. Alfred established a series of forts and lookout posts linked by a military road, or herepath, so his army could cover Viking movements at sea. The herepath has a characteristic form that is familiar on the Quantocks: a regulation wide track between avenues of trees growing from hedge laying embankments. The herepath ran from the ford on the River Parrett at Combwich, past Cannington hill fort to Over Stowey, where it climbed the Quantocks along the line of the current Stowey road, to Crowcombe Park Gate. Then it went south along the ridge, to Triscombe Stone. One branch may have led past Lydeard Hill and Buncombe Hill, back to Alfred&#x27;s base at Athelney. The main branch descended the hills at Triscombe, then along the avenue to Red Post Cross, and west to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor. There is some evidence that an area of the hills known as Quantock Common may have been a Saxon Royal Forest.

===Medieval===
After the Norman conquest of England in 1066 William de Moyon was given land at Dunster, Broomfield and West Quantoxhead, his son becoming William de Mohun of Dunster, 1st Earl of Somerset, while William Malet received Enmore. East Quantoxhead was given to the Luttrells (previously spelled de Luterel), who passed the manor down through descendants into the 20th century. A Luttrell also became the Earl of Carhampton and acquired Dunster Castle in 1376, holding it until it became a National Trust property in 1976.

Stowey Castle at Nether Stowey was built in the 11th century. The castle is sited on a small isolated knoll, about high. It consisted of a square keep (which may have been stone, or a wooden superstructure on stone foundations) and its defences and an outer and an inner bailey. The mount is above the wide ditch which itself is deep. The motte has a flat top with two large and two small mounds, which may be sites of towers, at the edge. The Blue Lias rubble walling is the only visible structural remains of the castle, which stand on a conical earthwork with a ditch approximately in circumference. The castle was destroyed in the 15th century, which may have been as a penalty for the local Lord Audley&#x27;s involvement in the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 led by Perkin Warbeck against the taxes of Henry VII. Some of the stone was used in the building of Stowey Court in the village.

===Modern===
There was very little action on the Quantocks during the English Civil War. Sir John Stawell of Cothelstone was a leading Royalist. When Taunton fell to parliamentary troops and was held by Robert Blake, he attacked Stawell at Bishops Lydeard and imprisoned him. After the restoration Charles II conferred the title of Baron Stawell on Stawell&#x27;s son Ralph. A group of Clubmen met at Triscombe in 1645 and petitioned parliament calling for peace through negotiation.

At the end of the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, (also known as the Pitchfork Rebellion), many participants were executed in the Quantocks. The rebellion was an attempt to overthrow the King of England, James II, who became king when his elder brother, Charles II, died on 6 February 1685. James II was unpopular because he was Roman Catholic, and many people were opposed to a &quot;papist&quot; king. James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, claimed to be rightful heir to the throne and attempted to displace James II. The rebellion ended with the defeat of Monmouth&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685. Monmouth was executed for treason on 15 July, and many of his supporters were executed, including some by hanging at Nether Stowey and Cothelstone, or transported in the Bloody Assizes of Judge Jeffreys.

Dodington was the site of the Buckingham Mine where copper was extracted. The mine was established before 1725 and followed earlier exploration at Perry Hill, East Quantoxhead. It was financed by the Marquis of Buckingham until 1801 when it was closed, until various attempts were made to reopen it during the 19th century.
In 1724 the 14th-century spire of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe was damaged by a lightning strike. The top section of the spire was removed and is now planted in the churchyard, and stone from the spire was used in the flooring of the church. Inside the church, carved bench-ends dating from 1534 depict such pagan subjects as the Green Man and the legend of the men of Crowcombe fighting a two-headed dragon.

Norton Fitzwarren was the site of a boat lift on the now unused section of the Grand Western Canal from 1839 to 1867. A 300-person prisoner of war camp built here during World War II housed Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign and German prisoners from the Battle of Normandy.

==Walking routes==
Poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in Nether Stowey in the Quantocks from 1797 to 1799. In his memory a footpath, The Coleridge Way, was set up by the Exmoor park authorities. The route begins in Nether Stowey and crosses the Quantocks, the Brendon Hills and Exmoor before finishing in Porlock.

The Quantock Greenway is a footpath that opened in 2001. The route of the path follows a figure of eight centred on Triscombe. The northern loop, taking in Crowcombe and Holford, is long, and the southern loop to Broomfield extends for . The path travels through many types of landscape, including deciduous and coniferous woodland, private parkland, grazed pasture and cropped fields.

The Macmillan Way West follows the Quantocks ridge for several miles.

==Governance==
The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. Notice of the intention to create the AONB under &quot;The Quantock Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Designation) Order, 1956&quot; was published in the London Gazette on 7 February 1956.

Since responsibility for the Quantock AONB is shared between the County Council and three District Councils The Quantock Hills Joint Advisory Committee was set up in 1973. The JAC represents County, District and Parish councils along with representatives from Natural England, Friends of Quantock, the Forestry Commission, The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), Somerset Local Access Forum,
the Quantock Commoners Association, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Trust, and the National Farmers Union. The JAC commissions the AONB service both to draw up management plans for the Quantocks and to carry them out.

==Ownership==
There is no single owner of the open land on the Quantocks or of the forestry plantations. Major landowners include the Forestry Commission, The National Trust, the Fairfield Estate, the Luttrell Estate, the Tetton Estate, Somerset County Council and Friends of Quantock.

==Cultural attractions and places of interest==
A series of concerts called Music on the Quantocks takes place each year in Quantock villages. Headlining acts have included Sir James Galway, guitarist John Williams and choral groups The Sixteen, The Tallis Scholars and the Gabrieli Consort. The concerts are run by volunteers.

One of the most popular Coleridge Cottage is a cottage situated in Nether Stowey. It was constructed in the 17th century as a building containing a parlour, kitchen and service room on the ground floor and three corresponding bed chambers above. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. Having served for many years as Moore&#x27;s Coleridge Cottage Inn, the building was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was handed over to the National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further rooms on the first floor were opened.
At Aley is Quantock Lodge, a green-grey 19th-century mansion built from cockercombe tuff. It was the family home of Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton, until the 1960s when it was converted into a school. In 2000, it became a centre for recreation and banqueting and summer camps for youths.

Broomfield is home to Fyne Court. Once the home of pioneer 19th century electrician, Andrew Crosse. Since 1972 it has been owned by the National Trust. The Quantock Hills National Landscape Service have their headquarters at Fyne Court.
The Church of St Mary in Kingston St Mary dates from the 13th century, but the tower is from the early 16th century and was re-roofed in 1952, with further restoration from 1976 to 1978. It is a three-stage crenellated tower, with crocketed pinnacles, bracketed pinnacles set at angles, decorative pierced merlons, and set-back buttresses crowned with pinnacles. The decorative &quot;hunky-punks&quot; are perched high on the corners. These may be so named because the carvings are hunkering (squatting) and are &quot;punch&quot; (short and thick). They serve no function, unlike gargoyles that carry off water. The churchyard includes tombs of the Warre family who owned nearby Hestercombe House, a historic country house in Cheddon Fitzpaine visited by about 70,000 people per year. The site includes a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest notified in 2000. The site is used for roosting by Lesser horseshoe bats, and has been designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The house was used as the headquarters of the British 8th Corps during the Second World War, and has been owned by Somerset County Council since 1951. It is used as an administrative centre and a base for the Somerset Fire and Rescue Service.

The originally Norman Church of St Giles in Thurloxton dates from the 14th century but is predominantly from the 15th century with 19th century restoration, including the addition of the north aisle in 1868. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. From October 1763 to January 1764 the vicar was the diarist James Woodforde.
The West Somerset Railway (WSR) is a heritage railway that runs along the edge of the Quantock Hills between Bishops Lydeard and Watchet. The line then turns inland to Washford, and returns to the coast for the run to Minehead. At , it is the longest privately owned passenger rail line in the UK.

Halsway Manor in Halsway, is now used as England&#x27;s National Centre for Traditional Music, Dance and Song. It is the only residential folk centre in the UK. The eastern end of the building dates from the 15th century and the western end was a 19th-century addition. The manor, which is mentioned in the Domesday Book, was at one time used by Cardinal Beaufort as a hunting lodge and thereafter as a family home until the mid-1960s when it became the folk music centre. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building.

Halswell House in Goathurst has Tudor origins but was purchased by the Tynte family and rebuilt in 1689. The surrounding park and pleasure garden was developed between 1745 and 1785. The grounds contain many fish ponds, cascades, bridges and fanciful buildings, including the Temple of Harmony, which stands in Mill Wood and has now been fully restored.

<text>The University of Iowa (U of I, UIowa, or Iowa) is a public research university in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. Founded in 1847, it is the oldest and largest university in the state. The University of Iowa is organized into 12 colleges offering more than 200 areas of study and 7 professional degrees.

On an urban 1,880-acre campus on the banks of the Iowa River, the University of Iowa is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. In fiscal year 2021, research expenditures at Iowa totaled $818 million. The university was the original developer of the Master of Fine Arts degree and it operates the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, whose alumni include 17 of the university&#x27;s 46 Pulitzer Prize winners. Iowa is a member of the Association of American Universities and the Universities Research Association.

Among public universities in the United States, UI was the first to become coeducational and host a department of religious studies; it also opened the first coeducational medical school. The University of Iowa&#x27;s 32,000 students take part in nearly 500 student organizations. Iowa&#x27;s 22 varsity athletic teams, the Iowa Hawkeyes, compete in Division I of the NCAA and are members of the Big Ten Conference. The University of Iowa alumni network exceeds 250,000 graduates.

==History==

===Founding and early history===
The University of Iowa was founded on February 25, 1847, just 59 days after Iowa was admitted to the Union. The Constitution of the State of Iowa refers to a State University to be established in Iowa City &quot;without branches at any other place.&quot; The legal name of the university is the State University of Iowa, but the Board of Regents approved using &quot;The University of Iowa&quot; for everyday usage in October 1964.

The first faculty offered instruction at the university beginning in March 1855 to students in the Old Mechanics Building, located where the student recreational area east of Van Allen Hall is now. In September 1855, there were 124 students, of whom forty-one were women. The 1856–57 catalog listed nine departments offering ancient languages, modern languages, intellectual philosophy, moral philosophy, history, natural history, mathematics, natural philosophy, and chemistry. The first president of the university was Amos Dean.

The original campus consisted of the Iowa Old Capitol Building and the (4.05 hectares) of land on which it stood. Following the placing of the cornerstone July 4, 1840, the building housed the Fifth Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Iowa (December 5, 1842) and then became the first capitol building of the State of Iowa on December 28, 1846. Until that date, it had been the third capitol of the Territory of Iowa. When the capitol of Iowa was moved to Des Moines in 1857, the Old Capitol became the first permanent &quot;home&quot; of the university.

In 1855, the university became the first public university in the United States to admit men and women on an equal basis. In addition, Iowa was the world&#x27;s first university to accept creative work in theater, writing, music, and art on an equal basis with academic research.

The university was one of the first institutions in America to grant a law degree to a woman (Mary B. Hickey Wilkinson, 1873), to grant a law degree to an African American (Alexander G. Clark, Jr. in 1879), and to put an African American on a varsity athletic squad (Frank Holbrook in 1895). The university awarded its first doctorate in 1898.

===20th century–present===

The University of Iowa established the first law school and dental school west of the Mississippi River. It was the first university to use radio (later television, too) in education, in 1932, and it pioneered in the field of standardized testing. Also, the University of Iowa was the first Big Ten institution to promote an African American to the position of administrative vice president (Phillip Hubbard, promoted in 1966).

Under the leadership of Carl Seashore in 1922, Iowa became the first university in the United States to accept creative projects as theses for advanced degrees. Traditionally, graduate study culminates in the writing of a scholarly thesis, but Iowa accepted creative works including a collection of poems, a musical composition, or a series of paintings to be presented to the graduate college in support of a degree. In so doing, Iowa established a creative standard in qualifying for the Master of Fine Arts degree and secured a place for writers and artists in the academy. The university&#x27;s Program in Creative Writing, known worldwide as the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, was founded in 1936 with the gathering together of writers of both poetry and fiction. It was the first creative writing program in the country, and it became the prototype for more than 300 writing programs, many of which were founded by Workshop alumni. The workshop remains the most prestigious creative writing program in the country and one of the most selective graduate programs of any kind, typically admitting fewer than five percent of its applicants.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission conducted several experiments examining the effects of iodine-131 administration in pregnant women (scheduled for abortions) and infants in 1953 and 1963, respectively.

The university was the first state university to recognize the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Allied Union (in 1970).

A shooting took place on campus on November 1, 1991. Six people died in the shooting, including the perpetrator, and one other person was wounded. This was one of the deadliest university campus shootings in United States history.

In the summer of 2008, flood waters breached the Coralville Reservoir spillway, damaging more than 20 major campus buildings. Several weeks after the floodwaters receded, university officials placed a preliminary estimate on flood damage at $231.75 million. Later, the university estimated that repairs would cost about $743 million. The reconstruction and renovation work took a decade, but the university has recovered and taken several preventive measures with the hope of avoiding a tragic repeat of the event.

In January 2009, UNESCO designated Iowa City the world&#x27;s third City of Literature, making it part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

In 2015, the Iowa Board of Regents selected Bruce Harreld, a business consultant with limited experience in academic administration, to succeed Sally Mason as president. The regents&#x27; choice of Harreld provoked criticism and controversy on the UI campus due to his corporate background, lack of history in leading an institution of higher education, and the circumstances related to the search process. The regents said they had based their decision on the belief that Harreld could limit costs and find new sources of revenue beyond tuition in an age of declining state support for universities.

==Campus==

The University of Iowa&#x27;s main campus is in Iowa City. The campus is roughly bordered by Park Road and U.S. Highway 6 to the north and Dubuque and Gilbert streets to the east. The Iowa River flows through the campus, dividing it into west and east sides.

Of architectural note is the Pentacrest which comprises five major buildings—Old Capitol, Schaeffer Hall, MacLean Hall, Macbride Hall, and Jessup Hall—at the center of the University of Iowa Campus. The Pentacrest reflects the Beaux-Arts in addition to Greek Revival architectural styles and the Collegiate Gothic architecture, which is dominant in sections of the campus east of the Iowa River. The Old Capitol was once the home of the state legislature and the primary government building for the State of Iowa but is now the symbolic heart of the university with a restored ceremonial legislative chamber and a museum of Iowa history.

Also on the east side of the campus are six residence halls (Burge, Daum, Stanley, Currier, Mayflower, and Catlett), the Iowa Memorial Union, the Women&#x27;s Resource &amp; Action Center, the Pappajohn Business Building, Seamans Center for the Engineering Arts and Sciences, the Lindquist Center (home of the College of Education), Phillips Hall (the foreign language building), Van Allen Hall (home to physics and astronomy), Trowbridge Hall (home to Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, as well as the Iowa Geological Survey), the English-Philosophy Building, the Becker Communication Building, the Adler Journalism Building, Voxman Music Building, and the buildings for biology, chemistry, and psychology. The Main Library can also be found on the east side.

The Colleges of Law, Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Public health are on the west side of the Iowa River, along with the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Art Building West and Visual Arts Building, and the Theatre Building. Additionally, five residence halls (Hillcrest, Slater, Rienow, Parklawn, and Petersen), Kinnick Stadium, and Carver-Hawkeye Arena are located on the west campus.

The campus is home to several museums, including the University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art, the Museum of Natural History, the Old Capitol Museum, the Medical Museum, the Athletic Hall of Fame and Museum, and Project Art at the University Hospitals and Clinics.

A flood of the Iowa River in 2008 had a major impact on several campus buildings, forcing many to temporarily or permanently close. The upper levels of the Iowa Memorial Union remained open while its lower level was renovated. The arts campus, which included Art Building West, Old Art Building, Hancher Auditorium, Voxman Music Building, Clapp Recital Hall, and the Theatre Building, sustained significant damage. Art Building West reopened in 2012 after repairs were completed. Sections of Old Art Building were razed, leaving only the historic WPA-era building, which includes regionalist artist Grant Wood&#x27;s former studio. Esteemed artists Elizabeth Catlett, Ana Mendieta, and Charles Ray were all trained in this building. The new Visual Arts Building was opened on a higher plot of land adjacent to Art Building West in 2016 after years when studio arts were housed in a temporary facility. Hancher Auditorium was rebuilt near its current site on the West bank of the Iowa River, and Voxman Music Hall was constructed adjacent to downtown Iowa City and the main campus on South Clinton Street. The new Hancher Auditorium and the new Voxman Music Building opened in 2016.

The Oakdale Campus, which is home to some of the university&#x27;s research facilities and the driving simulator, is located north of Interstate 80 in adjacent Coralville.

<text>North Thoresby is a village and civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. It is situated between Louth and Grimsby, approximately from each. and has a village population of 1,068 (2011) Some 50.5% of the population is older than 60 years.

The area is chiefly agricultural, but the majority of employed residents work in Grimsby and Cleethorpes, or in the industries situated on the Humber bank.

The name North Thoresby is composed of the given name Thor and the suffix &#x27;by&#x27;, as with other villages in the area – indicating the influence of the Vikings. South Thoresby, also in Lincolnshire, is located to the south of Louth. Thoresby Hall is not in this area, but is located in Nottinghamshire some to the west.

==History==
Researchers believe they found archeological evidence, just outside the village, that grapes were grown in the area by the Romans during their occupation. This claim has been contested. The Village lies on a Roman road from Cadeby to North Coates, believed to have been a route of salt transportation from the coast to Lincoln.

North Thoresby is listed in the same &quot;Domesday&quot; entry as Autby, and in 1416 it was combined into Thoresby-cum-Autby parish, following the desertion of Autby and the loss of the village church.

The Anglican parish church, St Helen&#x27;s, occupies a site where Christian worship has continued for more than 1,000 years. Like most churches of its age it has seen many alterations from an original simple room to a 15th-century edifice with north and south aisles. The south aisle was demolished in Elizabethan times but remains of it survive inside the church. The church includes part of a Saxon grave cover, Tudor bench-ends and Restoration plaques which record the work tradesman such as &quot;putty makers&quot;. There is also a memorial tablet to Francis Bond (1852-1918), the late 19th-century authority on Gothic architecture, who was born in the village. Historically the parish was within Haverstoe, the south division of the Bradley-Haverstoe wapentake, in the North Riding of Lindsey.

North Thoresby was enclosed in 1839, its Tithe barn still stands having been converted into a private dwelling standing to the east of the rectory.

Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists each had a chapel here prior to 1900. The Methodist chapel, school and school house, were built in the mid-19th century. In 1985 the school and house were converted into a community centre, The Wesley Centre, when the primary school relocated to a new building on High Street.
During the Second World War, on 4 October 1943, an RAF Avro Lancaster ED583 crashed in the village during a test flight from RAF Waltham, killing the crew. A memorial was dedicated to them on 4 September 2005.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south to Ludborough with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 1,933.

==Amenities==
North Thoresby has two public houses (with restaurants), a number of shops, a microbrewery, a used-car sales company, a primary school, surgery and pharmacy, a village hall, and facilities for football, cricket and bowls. Both the Parish Council and a voluntary group, The Village People, promote community activities.

==Transport==
North Thoresby is on the route of regular bus service between Louth and Grimsby. The village is also served by the National Express route between Grimsby and London, and Grimsby and Westward Ho!, stopping on the A16 close to the Halfway House, formerly Marquis of Granby public house. The village&#x27;s railway station was on the East Lincolnshire Railway line from Louth to Grimsby until closed to passengers in 1970, with all freight movement on the line suspended in 1980 following the Beeching Axe. The line was reopened in part as the heritage Lincolnshire Wolds Railway in 2009, which currently runs between the village and Ludborough.

==Sport==
North Thoresby and District Bowls Club are an outdoor bowls club affiliated to the English Bowling Federation, and play in four leagues - Grimsby, Skegness, Louth Wold and Lindsey Marsh. The team is based at The Storr Green. Amy Monkhouse, a World Ladies Bowls Champion, first became interested in the game at the club.

==Notable people==
* Luke Fawcett, a trade unionist, awarded a knighthood in 1948.
* Thomas Kendall, a New Zealand missionary and recorder of the Māori language.
* Robert Mapletoft, an English churchman and academic, Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge and Dean of Ely.

<doc id="241125" wikidata="Q25910299" url="?curid=241125" title="Minister of State for Development">
<text>The minister of state for development, formerly the minister of state for development and Africa and the secretary of state for international development, is a senior minister of the Crown within the Government of the United Kingdom.

The officeholder headed the Department for International Development (DFID) as secretary of state from 1997 to 2020. The office formed part of the British Cabinet. The Department for International Development was abolished in September 2020, and Anne-Marie Trevelyan was the final holder of the post.

The post was made a ministerial position attending Cabinet in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in 2022. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow cabinet minister for international development.

==History==
A separate Ministry of Overseas Development was established by Harold Wilson when he came to office in 1964. The first three holders of the office served in the Cabinet, but from 29 August 1967 the office was demoted. Under Edward Heath, the Ministry was re-incorporated into the FCO on 15 October 1970. Wilson again established the Ministry in 1974, but later merged it into the FCO once again: from 10 June 1975 to 8 October 1979 the foreign secretary served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Minister for Overseas Development in the cabinet, while the minister for overseas development held the rank of Minister of State within the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The minister of state had day-to-day responsibility. Under the Labour government of the 1970s, Reg Prentice sat in the Cabinet during his term. The post&#x27;s last and main format was created in 1997 when the Department for International Development was made independent of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

In June 2020, it was announced the Department for International Development would be dissolved, and its operations would be merged into the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The process was completed by 2 September 2020, with the last international development secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan remaining in place until that time.

In 2022, the position was revised in the as a minister of state attending Cabinet during the Truss ministry. From 2022 to 2024 under the Sunak ministry, the position was combined with responsibility for Africa as the Minister of State for Development and Africa.

==Responsibilities==
The Minister&#x27;s responsibilities include:

* education, gender and equality
* development and open societies
* humanitarian and migration
* international finance
* British Investment Partnerships
* global health
* conflict, stabilisation and mediation
* energy, climate and the environment
* research and evidence

<doc id="241126" wikidata="Q335698" url="?curid=241126" title="Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos">
<text>Valerie Ann Amos, Baroness Amos (born 13 March 1954) is a British Labour Party politician and diplomat who served as the eighth UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Before her appointment to the UN, she served as British High Commissioner to Australia. She was created a life peer in 1997, serving as Leader of the House of Lords and Lord President of the Council from 2003 to 2007.

When she was appointed Secretary of State for International Development on 12 May 2003, following the resignation of Clare Short, Amos became the first Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) woman to serve as a Cabinet minister. She left the Cabinet when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister. In July 2010, Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon announced Baroness Amos&#x27;s appointment to the role of Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. She took up the position on 1 September 2010 and remained in post until 29 May 2015. In September 2015, Amos was appointed Director of SOAS, University of London, becoming the first black woman to lead a university in the United Kingdom.

Since September 2020, Amos has been Master of University College, Oxford, succeeding Sir Ivor Crewe and becoming the first-ever black head of an Oxford college, as well as the first woman to head that college.

==Early life==
Amos was born in 1954 in British Guiana (now Guyana) in South America and, after moving with her family to Great Britain in 1963, she attended Bexley Technical High School for Girls (now Townley Grammar School), Bexleyheath, where she was the first black deputy head girl. She completed a degree in Sociology at the University of Warwick (1973–76), an MA in cultural studies at the University of Birmingham (where the department was led by Stuart Hall), and studied education at the University of East Anglia.

==Charity career==
After working in Equal Opportunities, Training and Management Services in local government in the London boroughs of Lambeth, Camden and Hackney, Amos became Chief Executive of the Equal Opportunities Commission in 1989, leaving the position in 1994.

In 1995, Amos co-founded the consultancy firm Amos Fraser Bernard and was an adviser to the South African government on public service reform, human rights and employment equity.
Amos has also been deputy chair of the Runnymede Trust (1990–1998); a trustee of the Institute for Public Policy Research; a non-executive director of the University College London Hospitals Trust; a trustee of Voluntary Service Overseas; chair of the Afiya Trust; a director of Hampstead Theatre; chair of the Board of Governors of the Royal College of Nursing Institute; and a trustee, now patron, of the Serious Trust.

==House of Lords==
Amos was elevated to the peerage in August 1997 as Baroness Amos, of &quot;Brondesbury in the London Borough of Brent&quot;. In the House of Lords, she was a co-opted member of the Select Committee on European Communities Sub-Committee F (Social Affairs, Education and Home Affairs) from 1997 to 1998. From 1998 to 2001, she was a Government Whip in the House of Lords and also a spokesperson on Social Security, International Development and Women&#x27;s Issues as well as one of the Government&#x27;s spokespersons in the House of Lords on Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Baroness Amos was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Affairs on 11 June 2001, with responsibility for Africa; Commonwealth; Caribbean; Overseas Territories; Consular Issues and FCO Personnel. She was replaced by Chris Mullin.

===International Development Secretary and Leader of the House of Lords===

After previously threatening to resign as International Development Secretary in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Clare Short eventually stood down in May 2003 over a draft UN resolution that she felt failed to give &quot;the UN its promised central role in rebuilding Iraq&quot;. Baroness Amos, who had been serving as Foreign Office minister and as a spokesperson in the Lords for International Development was swiftly announced as Short&#x27;s replacement. Her appointment made her &quot;the UK&#x27;s first black woman cabinet minister&quot; and was an unusual example of a government department being headed by a member of the House of Lords.

Baroness Amos was appointed Leader of the House of Lords on 6 October 2003, following the death of Lord Williams of Mostyn, which meant that her tenure as Secretary of State for International Development lasted less than six months.

On 17 February 2005, the British Government nominated Lady Amos to head the United Nations Development Programme., but the position was assigned to Kemal Derviş.

==Non-governmental roles==
Baroness Amos left the cabinet when Gordon Brown took over as prime minister from Tony Blair in June 2007. Brown proposed her as the European Union special representative to the African Union. However, Belgian career diplomat Koen Vervaeke was appointed to this role instead. She was a member of the Committee on Commonwealth Membership, which presented its report on potential changes in membership criteria for the Commonwealth of Nations at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2007 in Kampala, Uganda. She was a member of the board of the Sierra Leone Titanium Resources Group.

On 8 October 2008, it was reported that Amos was to join the Football Association&#x27;s management board for England&#x27;s bid to host the 2018 World Cup. This was described as a &quot;surprise appointment&quot;, since she has no recorded interest in football (despite her interest in cricket) or any experience in similar work such as the 2012 Olympics bid.

==British High Commissioner to Australia==
On 4 July 2009, it was announced that Baroness Amos had been appointed British High Commissioner to Australia in succession to Helen Liddell (now Baroness Liddell). Amos took up the position in October 2009.

==UN Emergency Relief Coordinator==
In 2010, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Amos&#x27;s appointment as Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. In March 2012, she visited Syria on behalf of the UN to press the Syrian government to allow access to all parts of Syria to help people affected by the insurgency.

In 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Margaret Chan appointed Amos as member of the Advisory Group on Reform of WHO&#x27;s Work in Outbreaks and Emergencies with Health and Humanitarian Consequences. Since 2019, Amos has been serving on the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies’ (CSIS) Task Force on Humanitarian Access, co-chaired by Cory Booker and Todd Young.

==University career==

In September 2015, she became the ninth director of SOAS University of London, the first woman of African descent to be director of an institute of higher education in Great Britain. In 2019, she co-led a report by Universities (UUK) and the National Union of Students (NUS) addressing the disparity between the proportion of &quot;top degrees&quot; (first or 2:1 degrees) achieved by white and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) students.

In January 2021, Amos left her position at SOAS to become Master of University College, Oxford, as both the first woman appointed to that post and the first black head of any Oxford college.

==Honours==
Amos was awarded an honorary professorship at Thames Valley University in 1995 in recognition of her work on equality and social justice. On 1 July 2010, she received the honorary degree of Doctor of the University (DUniv) from the University of Stirling in recognition of her &quot;outstanding service to our society and her role as a model of leadership and success for women today.&quot; She has also been awarded the honorary degrees of Doctor of Laws (Hon LLD) from the University of Warwick in 2000 and the University of Leicester in 2006.

At the University of Birmingham, where she studied as an undergraduate, the Guild of Students have named one of the committee rooms &quot;The Amos Room&quot; after her, in acknowledgement of her services to society.

In 2012, Amos was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (Hon LLD) from the University of Nottingham, and in 2013, made an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (Hon DCL) at Durham University.

Amos was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to the United Nations and emergency relief.

In 2017, Amos was awarded an honorary degree at Middlesex University, thereby &quot;recognising achievement at the highest level as well as dedication to public duty and making a difference to others&#x27; lives.&quot;

In July 2018, Amos received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree (Hon LLD) from the University of Bristol. In December 2018, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Literature (Hon DLitt) by the University of the Witwatersrand.

She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences as an International Honorary Member in 2019.

On 1 January 2022, the Queen appointed Amos a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG). Amos&#x27;s banner of arms was erected at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor on 13 June. Amos is the first black &quot;knight or lady companion&quot; member of the order since its foundation (excluding the Emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie, who as a foreign monarch was a stranger knight companion of the order).

In November 2022, Amos was awarded an honorary fellowship of the University of London.

In May 2023, Amos took part in the Coronation of Charles III, representing the Order of the Garter.

In July 2023, the University of Sussex awarded Amos an honorary degree, praising her as &quot;the first Black woman to lead a university&quot;, and in November of the same year, she was conferred with an Honorary Doctor of Law degree (Hon LLD) from the University of Guyana.

==Coat of Arms==
==Personal life==
Amos is an enthusiast of cricket and talked about her love of the game with Jonathan Agnew on &quot;Test Match Special&quot; during the lunch break of the first day of the England v. New Zealand test match at Old Trafford in May 2008.

After resigning from the cabinet, Baroness Amos took up a directorship with Travant Capital, a Nigerian private equity fund launched in 2007. In the House of Lords Register of Members Interests, she lists this directorship as remunerated.

Amos was listed as one of &quot;the 50 best-dressed over-50s&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013.

<text>Michigan State University (Michigan State or MSU) is a public land-grant research university in East Lansing, Michigan, United States. It was founded in 1855 as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the first of its kind in the country. After the introduction of the Morrill Act in 1862, the state designated the college a land-grant institution in 1863, making it the first of the land-grant colleges in the United States. The college became coeducational in 1870. Today, Michigan State has facilities all across the state and over 634,000 alumni.

Michigan State is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The university&#x27;s campus houses the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, the Abrams Planetarium, the Wharton Center for Performing Arts, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, and the country&#x27;s largest residence hall system.

The university&#x27;s six professional schools include the College of Law (founded in Detroit, in 1891, as the Detroit College of Law and moved to East Lansing in 1995), Eli Broad College of Business; the College of Nursing, the College of Osteopathic Medicine (the world&#x27;s first state-funded osteopathic college), the College of Human Medicine, and the College of Veterinary Medicine. The university pioneered the studies of music therapy, packaging, hospitality business, supply chain management, and communication sciences.

University faculty, alumni, and affiliates include two Nobel Prize laureates, 20 Rhodes Scholars, 20 Marshall Scholars, and eight Pulitzer Prize winners. The Michigan State Spartans compete in the NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference. Spartan teams have won national championships in many sports, including football, men&#x27;s basketball, ice hockey, and women&#x27;s cross-country.

== History ==


The rise of scientific agriculture in Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century and the desire for formal agricultural education at the college level by forward looking agriculturalists in Michigan gave impetus to a movement that led to the establishment of the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan in 1855, the first of its kind in the United States, predating the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania (founded in 1855, renamed in 1862), the Maryland Agricultural College (founded in 1856), the Iowa Agricultural College (founded in 1858), the State Agricultural College within the University of Georgia (founded in 1859), and the Massachusetts Agricultural College (founded in 1863). The Michigan Farmer, a leading agricultural periodical, and the Michigan State Agricultural Society led public discussions relative to the virtues and benefits of an agricultural college for the state&#x27;s farmers and economy.

In early 1855, John Clough Holmes, secretary of the agricultural society, convinced the legislature to pass an act establishing &quot;a State Agricultural School&quot; to be located on a site selected by the Michigan State Agricultural Society within ten miles of Lansing. On February 12, 1855, Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the nation&#x27;s first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan. Professor Lautner contrasts Holmes&#x27; legacy with that of John Harvard, whose donation of a modest library and four hundred British pounds led to a major university that bears his name, implying that the college&#x27;s debt to Holmes is far greater. William J. Beal called Holmes &quot;the most important agent&quot; of the college. Holmes Hall, the home of the Lyman Briggs College, is named in his honor.

The State Board of Education was designated as the institution&#x27;s governing body. The board also oversaw the Michigan State Normal School in Ypsilanti, which had opened in 1852. Classes began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students.

Joseph R. Williams, the first president and a passionate promoter of interdisciplinary liberal arts education, encouraged a curriculum that went far beyond practical agriculture: &quot;The course of instruction in said college shall include the following branches of education, viz: an English and scientific course, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, animal and vegetable anatomy and physiology, geology, mineralogy, meteorology, entomology, veterinary art, mensuration, leveling and political economy, with bookkeeping and the mechanic arts which are directly connected with agriculture...&quot; From its inception, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan offered courses of study that would characterize the land-grant philosophy of higher education after the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862. Michigan&#x27;s agricultural college educated people to be well-informed citizens, as well as good farmers.

However, after just two years, Williams ran into conflict with the managing State Board of Education. Despite Williams&#x27; eloquent defense of an all-round education for the masses, the board saw the college as inefficient and had far deviated from the agriculture focus as the founder, John Clough Holmes, had anticipated. Indeed, some agriculturalists began protesting against the college&#x27;s unpractical curriculum with some even calling for the college&#x27;s abolition. Williams eventually resigned in 1859. The board then reduced the curriculum to a two-year, vocation-oriented farming program, which proved catastrophic and resulted almost overnight in a drastic reduction in enrollment. There was a high demand for an all-round education grounded in the liberal arts tradition instead of a specialized agriculture program, a fact the board disregarded. With a sharp decrease in tuition revenue, the college was soon in dire financial straits and threatened with dissolution.

In 1860, Williams became acting lieutenant governor and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This restored the college&#x27;s four-year curriculum and gave the college the power to grant master&#x27;s degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution. The college changed its name to State Agricultural College, and its first class graduated in the same year.

In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Land-Grant Acts to support similar colleges nationally, the first instance of federal funding for education. Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University the nation&#x27;s first land-grant college. The federal funding had rescued the Agricultural College from extinction.

Although the school&#x27;s then-isolated location limited student housing and enrollment during the 19th century, the college became reputable, largely due to alumni who went on to distinguished careers, many of whom led or taught in other land-grant colleges. While the institution emphasized scientific agriculture, its graduates went into a wide variety of professions.

The college first admitted women in 1870, although there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous stagecoach trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a &quot;Women Course&quot; that melded a home economics curriculum with liberal arts and sciences. That same year, the college turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women&#x27;s dormitory.

It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now Tuskegee University. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African American student to enroll at the college. Two years later, the college changed its name to Michigan Agricultural College.

During the early 20th century, Michigan Agricultural College expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925, it had expanded enough to change its name to Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science (MSC), or &quot;Michigan State&quot; for short. In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, John A. Hannah, became president of the college.

After World War II, Hannah began the largest expansion in the institution&#x27;s history, with the help of the 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah&#x27;s strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction of another dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.

Six years later, during the school&#x27;s centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan officially designated the school as a university, even though Hannah and others felt it had been one for decades. The college then became Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science. During the 1950s, Michigan State University was the &quot;preeminent&quot; example of a group of former agricultural colleges which had already evolved into state colleges and were attempting to become research universities. In 1957, Hannah continued MSU&#x27;s expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now Oakland University, with Matilda Dodge Wilson.
After the ratification of the Michigan Constitution of 1964, the university&#x27;s governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the Michigan State University Board of Trustees.

MSU was affiliated with Oakland University in Rochester Hills, Michigan, from the time of the latter&#x27;s founding in 1957 (as Michigan State University-Oakland), until 1970 when Oakland University gained institutional independence.

In September 2005, President Lou Anna Simon called for Michigan State to become the global model leader for land-grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new residential college and increased grants awarded from the National Institutes of Health past the US$100million mark. While there are over 100 land-grant universities in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.

== Campus ==
MSU&#x27;s sprawling campus is in East Lansing, Michigan. The campus is perched on the banks of the Red Cedar River. Development of the campus started in 1856 with three buildings: a multipurpose College Hall building, a dormitory later called &quot;Saints&#x27; Rest&quot;, and a barn. Today, MSU&#x27;s contiguous campus consists of , of which are developed. There are 563 buildings: 107 for academics, 131 for agriculture, 166 for housing and food service, and 42 for athletics. Overall, the university has of indoor space. Connecting it all is of roads and of sidewalks. MSU also owns 44 non-campus properties, totaling in 28 different counties.


In early 2017, construction of a $22.5million solar project began at five parking lots on campus. MSU&#x27;s solar carport array is constructed on five of the university&#x27;s largest commuter parking lots and covers 5,000 parking spaces. The solar carports are designed to deliver a peak power of 10.5 Megawatts and an annual energy of 15 million kilowatt-hours, which is enough to power approximately 1,800 Michigan homes. The solar carport project was recognized at the Smart Energy Decisions Innovation Summit 2018, earning the Onsite Renewable Energy award for “The Largest Carport Solar Array in North America.”

Some land owned by MSU is in Lansing, Lansing Charter Township, and Meridian Charter Township.

=== North campus ===

The oldest part of campus lies on the Red Cedar river&#x27;s north bank. It includes Collegiate Gothic architecture, plentiful trees, and curving roads with few straight lines. The college built its first three buildings here, of which none survive. Other historic buildings north of the river include the president&#x27;s official residence, Cowles House; and Beaumont Tower, a carillon clock tower marking the site of College Hall, the original classroom building. To the east lies Eustace–Cole Hall, America&#x27;s first freestanding horticulture laboratory. Other landmarks include the bronze statue of former president John A. Hannah, the W. J. Beal Botanical Garden, and the painted boulder known as &quot;The Rock&quot;, a popular spot for theater, tailgating, and candlelight vigils. On the campus&#x27;s northwest corner is the university&#x27;s hotel, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center. The university also has two museums. MSU Museum, initiated in 1857, is one of the Midwest&#x27;s oldest museums and is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. The Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, designed by Zaha Hadid, opened in 2012 as MSU&#x27;s primary art gallery, and features art from MSU&#x27;s permanent collection as well as from graduate students on campus.

=== South campus ===
The campus south of the river consists mostly of post-World War II International Style buildings, and is characterized by sparser foliage, relatively straight roadways, and many parking lots. The &quot;2020 Vision&quot; Master Plan proposes replacing these parking lots with parking ramps and green space, but these plans will take many years to reach fruition. As part of the master plan, the university erected a new bronze statue of &quot;The Spartan&quot; in 2005 to be placed at the intersection of Chestnut and Kalamazoo, just south of the Red Cedar River. This replica replaced the original modernist terra cotta statue, which can still be seen inside Spartan Stadium. Notable academic and research buildings on the South Campus include the Cyclotron, the College of Law, the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building, and the Broad College of Business.

This part of campus is home to the MSU Horticulture Gardens and the adjoining 4-H Children&#x27;s Garden. South of the gardens lie the Canadian National and CSX railroads, which divide the main campus from thousands of acres of university-owned farmland. The university&#x27;s agricultural facilities include the Horse, Dairy Cattle, Beef Cattle, Swine, Sheep, and Poultry Teaching and Research Farms, as well as the Air Quality Control Lab and the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

=== Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center ===
The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center doubles as a 4-star hotel and a business-friendly conference center. It is on the northwest corner of Michigan State University&#x27;s campus, across from the Brody Complex, on Harrison Road just south of Michigan Avenue. The hotel&#x27;s 160 rooms and suites can accommodate anyone staying in East Lansing for a business conference, sporting event or an on-campus visit. Besides a lodging facility, the Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center is a &quot;learning laboratory for the 300–400 students each year that are enrolled in The School of Hospitality Business and other majors.&quot; The Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center strives to facilitate education by hosting conferences and seminars.

=== Dubai campus ===
MSU ran a small campus at Dubai Knowledge Village, Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It first offered only one program, a master&#x27;s program in human resources and labor relations. In 2011, it added a master&#x27;s program in Public Health.

Previously, MSU established an education center in Dubai that offered six undergraduate programs, thereby becoming the first American university with a presence in Dubai International Academic City. The university attracted 100 students in 2007, its first year, but the school was unable to achieve the 100–150 new students per year needed for the program to be viable, and in 2010 MSU closed the program and the campus.

=== Detroit campus ===
MSU has a large presence in downtown Detroit. This campus includes programs with the College of Education, Detroit Outreach Admissions, MSU Community Music School of Detroit, and the Study of Active Neighborhoods in Detroit (StAND). MSU began a partnership with Apple in 2022, creating the Apple Developer Academy. On June 13, 2023, MSU purchased a majority stake in Detroit&#x27;s iconic Fisher Building. The MSU Research Foundation opened a startup incubator inside the Fisher Building later that year. In early 2023 MSU announced they would begin collaborating with Henry Ford Health on a new research center in Detroit.

=== College of Human Medicine campuses ===
The College of Human Medicine currently operates smaller campuses as partnerships with local health systems in multiple Michigan cities. The Grand Rapids Secchia Campus is the largest of these campuses, with plans to expand the campus in coming years. The Secchia Campus partners with multiple hospitals on Grand Rapids&#x27; Medical Mile. Other Michigan cities with campuses include Flint (Ascension Genesys Hospital, Hurley Medical Center, and McLaren Flint), Midland, Traverse City (Munson Medical Center), Marquette (UP Health System), Southfield (Ascension Providence Hospital), and Detroit (Henry Ford Health).

== Admissions ==

=== Undergraduate ===
Michigan State offers a rolling admissions system, with an early admission deadline in October, and does not offer an early decision plan. The 2022 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes MSU as &quot;more selective.&quot; For freshmen enrolled fall 2024, Michigan State received 62,138 applications and accepted 52,690 (84.8%). Of those accepted, 9,625 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 18.3%. MSU&#x27;s freshman retention rate is 91.4%, with 82.52% going on to graduate within six years.

The university started test-optional admissions with the fall 2021 incoming class in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has extended this through fall 2025. Of the 51% of enrolled freshmen in 2023 who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1110–1320. Of the 14% of the incoming freshman class who submitted ACT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 24 and 30.

The university has seen steady increases to its applicant pool in recent decades, and the number of applications has more than doubled since the Class of 2007 received 24,436 applications. Michigan state law does not require the state&#x27;s public universities to reserve their spaces for Michigan residents.

Together with Michigan Technological University, Wayne State University, Kalamazoo College, Hillsdale College, Calvin University, and Hope College, Michigan State is one of the seven college-sponsors of the National Merit Scholarship Program in the state. The university sponsored 30 Merit Scholarship awards in 2020. In the 2020–2021 academic year, 38 first-year students were National Merit Scholars.

The college&#x27;s faculty and alumni include eight Pulitzer Prize winners and a two-time Emmy Award winning recording mixer.

=== Collections and museums ===

The Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum is the university&#x27;s contemporary art museum.

The MSU Museum is the university&#x27;s oldest museum, founded in 1857. It is Michigan&#x27;s first Smithsonian Affiliate. The museum holds collections in anthropology, folklife, cultural heritage and history, mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, ichthyology, and vertebrate paleontology.

Michigan State University Libraries comprise North America&#x27;s 29th largest academic library system with over 4.9 million volumes and 6.7 million microforms.

=== Research ===
The university has a long history of academic research and innovation. In 1877, botany professor William J. Beal performed the first documented genetic crosses to produce hybrid corn, which led to increased yields. MSU dairy professor G. Malcolm Trout improved the process for the homogenization of milk in the 1930s, making it more commercially viable. In the 1960s, MSU scientists developed cisplatin, a leading cancer fighting drug, and followed that work with the derivative, carboplatin. Albert Fert, an Adjunct professor at MSU, was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics together with Peter Grünberg.

Michigan State continues its research with facilities such as the U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory and a particle accelerator called the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science named Michigan State University as the site for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) facility. Construction began in 2014 and was completed in 2022. The $730million facility has a goal to attract top researchers from around the world to conduct experiments in basic nuclear science, astrophysics, and applications of isotopes to other fields.

In 2004, scientists at the Cyclotron produced and observed a new isotope of the element germanium, called Ge-60. In that same year, Michigan State, in consortium with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the government of Brazil, broke ground on the 4.1-meter Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The consortium telescope will allow the Physics &amp; Astronomy department to study galaxy formation and origins. Since 1999, MSU has been part of a consortium called the Michigan Life Sciences Corridor, which aims to develop biotechnology research in the State of Michigan. Finally, the College of Communication Arts and Sciences&#x27; Quello Center researches issues of information and communication management.

Michigan State, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University created the University Research Corridor in 2006. This alliance was formed to transform and strengthen Michigan&#x27;s economy by reaching out to businesses, policymakers, innovators, investors and the public to speed up technology transfer, make resources more accessible and attract new jobs to the state.

=== Endowment ===
MSU&#x27;s (private, non-Morrill Act) endowment started in 1916, when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate Ransom E. Olds helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000, equivalent to $Million in .

There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100million in endowment funds. This changed dramatically in the 2000s decade, when the university started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment.

At the close of fiscal year 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325billion, raising the university to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2million of the fifth-rated school. As of June 30, 2021, MSU&#x27;s endowment had a market value of $4.4billion.

== Colleges ==
MSU has over 200 academic programs offered by 17 degree-granting colleges.

=== Residential colleges ===
MSU&#x27;s first residential college, Justin Morrill College started in 1965 with an interdisciplinary curriculum. MSU closed Morrill College in 1979, but today the university has three residential colleges, including the recent opening of the Residential College in Arts &amp; Humanities (RCAH) located in Snyder and Phillips halls.

Established in 1967, James Madison College is a smaller component residential college featuring multidisciplinary programs in the social sciences, founded on a model of liberal education. James Madison College is housed in Case Hall. Classes in the college are small, with an average of 25 students, and most instructors are tenure track faculty. James Madison College has about 1150 students total, with each freshman class containing about 320 students. Each of Madison&#x27;s four majors—Social Relations and Policy, International Relations, Political Theory and Constitutional Democracy, and Comparative Cultures and Politics—requires two years of foreign language and one semester of &quot;field experience&quot; in an internship or study abroad program. Although Madison students make up about 4% of MSU graduates, they represent around 35% of the MSU&#x27;s Phi Beta Kappa members.



Also established in 1967, Lyman Briggs College teaches math and science within social, historical and philosophical contexts. Many Lyman Briggs students intend to pursue careers in medicine, but the school supports over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences. Lyman Briggs is one of the few colleges that lets undergraduates teach as &quot;Learning Assistants.&quot;

MSU&#x27;s newest residential college is the Residential College in the Arts and Humanities (RCAH). Founded October 21, 2005, RCAH provides around 600 undergraduates with an individualized curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU encourages students in the college to get a second degree or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU&#x27;s first residential college, Justin Morrill College.

=== Professional schools ===
Founded in Detroit in 1891 as the Detroit College of Law, the law school moved to East Lansing in 1995, becoming Michigan State University College of Law. Students attending MSU College of Law come from 42 states and 13 countries. The law school publishes the &quot;Michigan State Law Review&quot;, the Michigan State Journal of International Law, the Journal of Medicine Law, and the Journal of Business &amp; Securities Law. The College of Law is the home of the Geoffrey Fieger Trial Practice Institute, the first trial practice institute in the United States. In October 2018, MSU&#x27;s board of trustees voted to fully integrate the College of Law into the university, thereby converting it from a private to a public law school. By August 2020, the College of Law had become fully integrated into the university.

The Eli Broad College of Business has programs in accounting, information systems, finance, general management, human resource management, marketing, supply chain management, and hospitality business. The school has 2,066 admitted undergraduate students and 817 graduate students. The Eli Broad Graduate School of Management, which &quot;Businessweek&quot; magazine in 2012 ranked 35th in the nation and 14th among public institutions, offers three MBA programs, as well as joint degrees with the College of Law. The opening of the Eugene C. Eppley Center for Graduate Studies in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management brought the first program in the United States to offer a Master of Business Administration degree in Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management to MSU.

The Michigan State University College of Nursing grants B.S.N., M.S.N., Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and PhD degrees, as well as post-graduate certificates. It was founded in 1950 and has trained more than 6,000 nurses. The college&#x27;s mission focuses on research, education and practice, and it is housed in the Life Sciences Building and Bott Building for Nursing Education and Research on the southeastern part of campus. The dean of the college, Randolph Rasch, was appointed to a statewide task force in 2020 by the governor to help establish an implicit bias training initiative for all health care workers in the state.

The Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world&#x27;s first publicly funded college of osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – more than two-thirds of the college&#x27;s graduates remain to practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician shortage.

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2016 rankings, the College of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O. degree) ranked tied for 12th among U.S. medical schools for primary care, and the College of Human Medicine (MD degree) was ranked 70th among the U.S. medical schools for primary care.

The College of Human Medicine graduates students with a Doctor of Medicine (M.D. degree) and is split into seven distinct campuses located in East Lansing, Kalamazoo, Flint, Saginaw, Marquette, Traverse City and Grand Rapids. Each campus is affiliated with local hospitals and other medical facilities professionals in the area. For example, the Lansing campus includes Sparrow Hospital and McLaren–Greater Lansing Hospital. The College of Human Medicine has recently gained attention for its expansion into the Grand Rapids area, with the new Secchia Center completed in the Fall of 2010, that is expected to fuel the growing medical industry in that region.

Though Michigan State has offered courses in veterinary science since its founding, the College of Veterinary Medicine was not formally established as a four-year, degree-granting program until 1910. In 2011, the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine was ranked No. 9 in the nation. The college has over of office, teaching, and research space, as well as a veterinary teaching hospital.

=== Other academic units ===
In recent years, MSU&#x27;s music program has grown substantially. Music major enrollment increased more than 97% between 1991 and 2004. In early 2007, this growth led the university board of trustees to spin the music program off into its own college unit: The MSU College of Music. The new college faces many new challenges, such as working with limited space and funding. Nevertheless, MSU&#x27;s music college plans on continued success, placing an annual average of 25 graduate students in tenure stream university positions.

The College of Education at Michigan State University offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in several fields, including counseling, educational psychology, special education, teacher education and kinesiology. The graduate school has several programs ranked in the top five in the country by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 2016: elementary teacher education (1st), secondary teacher education (1st), curriculum and instruction (3rd), educational psychology (4th), and higher education administration (4th). The College of Education is housed in Erickson Hall. MSU offers a 30 credit graduate program for a Master of Arts in Educational Technology in 3 different formats; completely online, hybrid in East Lansing, or overseas. Founded in 1956, the MSU Honors College provides individualized curricula to MSU&#x27;s top undergraduate students. Though the college offers no majors of its own, it has its own dean and academic advisers to help Honors students with their educational pursuits.
High school students starting at MSU may join the Honors College if they are in the top 5% of their high school graduating class and have an ACT score of at least 30 or an SAT total score of at least 1360. Students can also be admitted after their first semester, generally if they&#x27;re in the top 10% of their College in GPA. Once admitted, students must maintain a 3.20 GPA and complete eight approved honors courses to graduate with Honors College designation on their degree. If membership is relinquished, it cannot be reclaimed.

After three years of planning, The College of Engineering launched the first stages of its Residential Experience for Spartan Engineering, formally known as the Residential Option for Scientists and Engineers (ROSES). The program was in Wilson Hall after being housed in Bailey Hall for a number of years. The Residential program essentially combines with a brand new academic component, Cornerstone Engineering, where freshman engineering students not only get an overview of the engineering field, but also get a hands-on experience along with it. Global Engineering is a new subject that is of interest for not only the Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience programs, but the entire College of Engineering at MSU. Engineering in today&#x27;s society has shown to have a monumental impact on the global economy due to advancements in education, as well as interdependence on economics with infrastructure, computers, transportation, technology and other manufactured goods. The newly established Cornerstone Engineering and Residential Experience (CoRe) program in the College of Engineering has started programs abroad for more courses in engineering, including study abroad seminars. In 2014, the Detroit Free Press wrote a news article referencing Michigan State University&#x27;s Recruiting Trends 2014–15 report, which ranked engineering among the top 20 college degrees with the highest starting salaries.

MSU&#x27;s original mission as an agricultural college continues today in the .

== Athletics ==
Michigan State&#x27;s NCAA Division I-A program offers 12 varsity sports for men and 13 for women. Since their teams are called the Spartans, MSU&#x27;s mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty. The university participates in the Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports. The current athletic director is former MSU football player and NFL cornerback Alan Haller, who began his tenure on September 1, 2021.

In 1888 Michigan State University (then known as Michigan State Agricultural College) along with Olivet, Albion and Hillsdale Colleges was a founding member of the nation&#x27;s oldest athletic conference, the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA). MAC left the conference in 1907.

=== Football ===


Football has a long tradition at Michigan State. Starting as a club sport in 1884, football gained varsity status in 1896. The Spartans won the Rose Bowl in 1954, 1956, 1988, and 2014. They won national championships in 1951, 1952, 1955, 1957, 1965 and 1966. The Spartans accounted for four of the top eight selections in the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, the only time a college football program has accomplished such a feat. As of 2020, MSU was one of only four schools to have at least one player selected in every NFL Draft in the common draft era, starting in 1967. The 2021 NFL Draft marked the first time since 1941 that no Michigan State players were selected.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
MSU&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team has won the National Championship twice: in 1979 and again in 2000. The basketball team plays at the Jack Breslin Student Events Center.

=== Men&#x27;s ice hockey ===
The Michigan State University men&#x27;s ice hockey team started in 1924, though it has been a varsity sport only since 1950. The team has since won national titles in 1966, 1986 and 2007. The Spartans came close to repeating the national title in 1987, but lost the championship game to the North Dakota Fighting Hawks. They play at MSU&#x27;s Munn Ice Arena. Former head coach Ron Mason is college hockey&#x27;s winningest coach with 924 wins total and 635 at MSU. The current head coach is Adam Nightingale. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team competes in the Big Ten conference. They formerly competed in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Michigan State leads the CCHA in all-time wins, is second in CCHA Conference championships with 7, and is first in CCHA Tournament Championships with 11. As with other sports, the hockey rivalry between the Spartans and the Michigan Wolverines is a fierce one, and on October 6, 2001, the Spartans faced the Michigan Wolverines in the Cold War, during which a world record crowd of 74,554 packed Spartan Stadium to watch the game end in a 3–3 tie.
In the 2006–2007 season, the Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey team defeated Boston College for its third NCAA hockey championship.

=== Men&#x27;s cross country ===
Between World War I and World War II, Michigan State College competed in the Central Collegiate Conference, winning titles in 1926–1929, 1932, 1933 and 1935. Michigan State also experienced success in the IC4A, at New York&#x27;s Van Cortlandt Park, winning 15 team titles (1933–1937, 1949, 1953, 1956–1960, 1962, 1963 and 1968). Since entering the Big Ten in 1950, Michigan State has won 14 men&#x27;s team titles (1951–1953, 1955–1960, 1962, 1963, 1968, 1970 and 1971). Michigan State hosted the inaugural NCAA cross country championships in 1938 and every year thereafter through 1964 (there was no championship in 1943). The Spartans won NCAA championships in 1939, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1955, 1956, 1958 and 1959.

=== Wrestling ===
MSU Spartan Wrestling won their only team NCAA Championship in 1967. The current Spartans Head coach is Roger Chandler in his second season. The team competes on campus at the Jenison Field House. Spartan Wrestling has over 50 Big Ten Conference Champions, over 100 All-Americans, and 11 individual wrestlers have NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships. Notable former Spartan wrestlers include Rashad Evans and Gray Maynard.

== Student life ==
East Lansing is very much a college town, with 63.5% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah&#x27;s push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU&#x27;s 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.

In 2014 there were approximately 50,085 students, 38,786 undergraduate and 11,299 graduate and professional. The students are from all 50 states and 130 countries around the world.

=== Student body ===
MSU tied for tenth place among universities with the largest student enrollment in the U.S. for fall 2018. For the fiscal year of 2018–19, the Office of the Registrar conferred 12,354 degrees. The student body is 52% female and 48% male. While 75.1% of students come from all 83 counties in the State of Michigan, also represented are all 50 states in the U.S. and 138 other countries.

==== International engagement ====
In fall 2019, 5,660 international students enrolled at MSU, with the top five countries outside North America being China (2,965), India (506), South Korea (331), Saudi Arabia (222) and Taiwan (144). MSU&#x27;s study abroad program included with 2,755 Based on 2017–2018 numbers, MSU studied abroad in over 60 countries on all continents, including Antarctica.

According to a Brookings Institution report analyzing foreign student visa approvals from 2008 to 2012, MSU once enrolled the highest number of Chinese international students in the United States, with roughly 4,700 Chinese citizens enrolled during the period of the study. MSU later saw decreased Chinese enrollment and lost its status as the top destination of Chinese students, which former Michigan Department of Education head Tom Watkins attributed to a ramp-up in anti-China rhetoric by then-president Donald Trump and changes in Chinese domestic conditions. MSU saw a roughly 25 percent drop in overall international enrollment in the first full academic year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but numbers had begun to rebound by the fall of 2021, with university officials expecting a full recovery by the 2022–2023 academic year.

Amid the fall of Kabul in August 2021, MSU, in concert with US Representative Elissa Slotkin, facilitated the evacuation of over 70 staff, scholars, and their families related to an MSU-USAID collaborative program in Afghanistan. Twelve of the Afghan evacuees attached to this program were students in the university&#x27;s Grain Research and Innovation (GRAIN) project, hosted by Kabul University. Bypassing typical financial review procedures, university officials paid $250,000 on a university credit card for the emergency charter of an airplane to reunite evacuees in Albania. MSU facilitated the students&#x27; transfer to the Agricultural University of Tirana and then assisted in humanitarian parole into the United States in early 2022.

In February 2023, the Chinese Consulate-General in Chicago announced that two Chinese MSU students had been wounded in the 2023 Michigan State University shooting. Based on 2021 enrollment data from the university&#x27;s international office, China was still likely the largest source of international students for MSU at the time of the shooting.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===
With over 3,000 members, Michigan State University&#x27;s Greek Community is one of the largest in the US. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, and Alpha Phi sorority; the MSU Greek system now consists of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU&#x27;s four Greek governing councils: National Panhellenic Conference, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of nine organizations, five fraternities and four sororities. The Interfraternity Council and the Women&#x27;s Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU&#x27;s fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the American Cancer Society, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Listening Ear and previous charities include: the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura&#x27;s Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the Special Olympics, in which fraternity and sorority members get to help each other participate.

=== Student organizations ===
The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university undergraduate student government of Michigan State University. It was unusual among university student governments for its decentralized bicameral structure, and the relatively non-existent influence of the Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are nonpartisan and many are elected in noncompetitive races. Some services they offer include: free blue books, low cost copies and printing, free yearbooks, interest free loans, funding for student organizations, free legal consultation, and iClicker and graphing calculator rentals.

Students pay $21 per semester to fund the functions of the ASMSU, including stipends for the organization&#x27;s officers and activities throughout the year. Some students have criticized ASMSU for not having enough electoral participation to gain a student mandate. Turnout since 2001 has hovered between 3 and 17 percent, with the 2006 election bringing out 8% of the undergraduate student body.

Student-run organizations beyond student government also have a large impact on the East Lansing/Michigan State University community. Student Organizations are registered through the Department of Student Life, which currently has a registry of over 800 student organizations.

The Eli Broad College of Business includes 27 student organizations of primary interest to business students. The three largest organizations are the Finance Association (FA), the Accounting Student Association (ASA), and the Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA). The SCMA is the host of the university&#x27;s largest major specific career fair. The fair attracts over 100 companies and over 400 students each year.

=== Activism ===
Activists have played a significant role in MSU history. During the height of the Vietnam War, student protests helped create co-ed residence halls, and blocked the routing of Interstate 496 through campus. In the 1980s, Michigan State students convinced the university to divest the stocks of companies doing business in apartheid South Africa from its endowment portfolio, such as Coca-Cola. In 2011, a student group staged a large sit-in protest in the university President&#x27;s office as the culmination of multiple years of attempting to convince the administration to transition from coal energy production to 100% clean energy. In 2019, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined the Lansing Women&#x27;s March, standing with victims of sexual assault on campus. Following the February 13th shooting on campus which killed three students, a student group organized a peaceful protest on the steps of the Michigan State Capitol. This protest quickly led to new gun control bills being passed within the Michigan state legislature.

MSU has many student groups focused on political change. Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council of Graduate Students.

=== Sustainability ===
The MSU Office of Sustainability works with the University Committee for a Sustainable Campus to &quot;foster a collaborative learning culture that leads the community to heightened awareness of its environmental impact.&quot; The university is a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange, the world&#x27;s first greenhouse gas emission registry, and boasts the lowest electrical consumption per square foot among Big Ten universities. The university has set a goal of reducing energy use by 15%, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, reducing landfill waste by 30% by 2015.

The university has also pledged to meet LEED-certification standards for all new construction. In July 2009, the university completed construction of a $13.3million recycling center, and hopes to double their 2008 recycling rate of 14% by 2010.
The construction of Brody Hall, a residence hall of Michigan State University Housing, was completed in August 2011 and qualified for LEED Silver certification because the facility includes a rain water collection tank used for restroom fixtures, a white PVC roof, meters that will monitor utilities to make sure they are used efficiently, and the use of recycled matter and local sources for building materials.

=== Media ===
MSU has a variety of campus media outlets. The student-run newspaper is &quot;The State News&quot; and free copies are available online or at East Lansing newsstands. The paper prints 28,500 copies from Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and 15,000 copies Monday through Friday during the summer. The paper is not published on weekends, holidays, or semester breaks, but is continually updated online at statenews.com. The campus yearbook is called the &quot;Red Cedar Log&quot;.

Red Cedar Review, Michigan State University&#x27;s premier literary digest for over forty years, is the longest running undergraduate-run literary journal in the United States. It is published annually by the Michigan State University Press.

, an undergraduate-operated journal, features undergraduate scholarship at the university, and &quot;strives to reflect the intellectual climate fostered by the Department of History&quot;.

MSU also publishes a student-run magazine during the academic year called Ing Magazine. Created in 2007 by MSU alumnus Adam Grant, the publication is released at the beginning of each month and publishes 7 issues each school year. MSU also publishes a student-run fashion and lifestyle magazine called VIM Magazine once a semester.

Electronic media include three radio stations and one public television station, as well as student-produced television shows. MSU&#x27;s Public Broadcasting Service affiliate, WKAR-TV, the station is the second-oldest educational television station in the United States, and the oldest east of the Mississippi River. Besides broadcasting PBS shows, WKAR-TV produces its own local programming, such as a high school quiz bowl show called &quot;QuizBusters&quot;. In addition, MSU has three radio stations; WKAR-AM plays National Public Radio&#x27;s talk radio programming, whereas WKAR-FM focuses mostly on classical music programming. Michigan State&#x27;s student-run radio station, WDBM, broadcasts mostly alternative music during weekdays and electric music programming nights and weekends in addition to sports broadcasting, news reporting, producing podcasts, and organizing on-campus concerts.

=== Safety ===
Violent crime is rare on the campus, but similar to other major universities, there have been several larger incidents.

==== Agriculture Hall Arson ====
In a 1999 incident, eco-anarchist activists, including Rod Coronado, burned down part of Agriculture Hall, with four additional suspects being arrested and charged nearly a decade later, in 2008. It was the second case of domestic eco-terrorism at MSU resulting in indictments. In 1992, arsonists attacked the offices of two faculty members in Anthony Hall and vandalized campus mink research facilities.

==== Sexual assault investigation ====
On May 1, 2014, Michigan State University was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights &quot;for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints” by President Barack Obama&#x27;s White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault. &quot;The investigation at Michigan State involves its response to sexual harassment and sexual assault complaints involving students,&quot; according to one reporter. It was later reported in the same paper that &quot;An investigation by the U.S. Department of Education into how Michigan State University handles sexual assault complaints was spurred by an incident in Wonders Hall in August 2010, a spokesman said.&quot;

==== USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal ====
In 2016, a police report was filed alleging that in 2000, USA Gymnastics team doctor and MSU physician Larry Nassar (also a professor in the MSU College of Human Medicine) had sexually assaulted a minor named Rachael Denhollander under the guise of medical treatment. The allegation and allegations of physical abuse by others led to the arrest and eventual conviction of Nassar. A federal court sentenced him in 2017 and state courts in 2018. Between the police report filing and the time of sentencing, 156 victims, including Olympic gymnasts and MSU student athletes, came forward to speak of abuses inflicted by Nassar. &quot;The Detroit News&quot; reported that 14 MSU representatives—including athletic trainers, coaches, a university police detective, and administrators—had possibly been alerted of sexual misconduct by Nassar across two decades, with notification of an incident in 2014 documented by a Title IX investigation. Michigan State and USA Gymnastics have been accused of enabling Nassar&#x27;s abuse and are named as defendants in civil lawsuits that gymnasts and former MSU student athletes have filed against Nassar. On May 16, 2018, it was announced that Michigan State University had agreed to pay the victims of Nassar $500million, equivalent to $million in .

MSU&#x27;s role in the scandal, as well as mounting pressure from the public and alumni, led to several high-level staff changes, including the resignation of President Lou Anna Simon in January 2018, as well as the retirement of athletic director Mark Hollis and gymnastics coach Kathie Klages. Former Michigan Governor John Engler replaced Simon as interim president of the university, but resigned in January 2019 after a pattern of controversial comments about the ongoing scandal including that Nassar&#x27;s victims were &quot;enjoying&quot; the spotlight. In addition, several conspirators saw charges brought against them:

* March 2018 - William Strampel was arrested and charged with felony misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct for allegedly groping a student and storing nude photos of female students on his computer. Strampel was the former dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine and oversaw Larry Nassar&#x27;s clinic.
* August 2018 - former coach Klages was charged with two counts of lying to police regarding knowledge of Nassar&#x27;s sexual abuse.
* November 2018 - former university president Simon was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanor counts for lying to the police about her knowledge of sexual abuse committed by Nassar.
* June 2019, former dean Strampel was convicted of one count of felony misconduct in office and two counts of misdemeanor willful neglect of duty.

Strample was sentenced in August 2019 to one 11-month term and two one-year terms in county jail, with the sentences to run concurrently.

In February 2020, former coach Klages was found guilty on the charges of lying to police. A judge dismissed the criminal case against former president Simon in May 2020. In June, the Michigan Attorney General appealed to reinstate the charges.

====2021 Hazing death====
On November 20, 2021, Phat Nguyen died during an off-campus hazing incident in Pi Alpha Phi fraternity. The 21-year-old fraternity pledge and three other pledges were found unresponsive at 2 a.m. and transported to the local hospital. Despite performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Nguyen, firefighters were unable to save him. The fraternity chapter was banned by the university and the national fraternity.

==== 2023 mass shooting ====
On February 13, 2023, a mass shooting occurred on campus that resulted in three killed and five injured before the gunman took his own life. Police have yet to identify a motive. Classes were canceled for one week following the shooting, and several student-led protests supporting gun control legislation were held at the Michigan State Capitol in the week that followed.

== Investment office ==
The Michigan State University Investment Office oversees the management of the university&#x27;s endowment. Its investment strategy aims to support long-term growth while mitigating risks that market fluctuations bring. The office was created in 2016 to centralize the university&#x27;s investment operations. It was led in 2024 by Philip Zecher, who oversaw the selection of external fund managers and ensured adherence to the university&#x27;s investment policy. It is located on the university&#x27;s campus at 426 Auditorium Road, Room 412.

<text>In Irish mythology, Neman or Nemain (Modern Irish: Neamhan, Neamhain) is the spirit-woman or goddess who personifies the frenzied havoc of war. In the ancient texts where The Morrígan appears as a trio of goddesses — the three sisters who make up the &quot;Morrígna&quot; — include Macha and Badb; Nemain is strongly associated with Badb with whom she shares a husband, Neit. Nemain may be an aspect of Badb.

==Representation in literature==
In the grand Irish epic of the Tain Bo Cuailnge, Neman confounds armies, so that friendly bands fall in mutual slaughter. When the forces of Queen Medb arrive at Magh-Tregham, in the present county of Longford, on the way to Cuailnge, Nemain appears amongst them:

“Then the Neman attacked them, and that was not the most comfortable night with them, from the uproar of the giant Dubtach through his sleep. The bands were immediately startled, and the army confounded, until Medb went to check the confusion.” Lebor na hUidhre, fol. 46, b1.
And in another passage, in the episode called &quot;Breslech Maighe Muirthemhne,” where a terrible description is given of Cuchullain&#x27;s fury at seeing the hostile armies of the south and west encamped within the borders of Ulaid, we are told (Book of Leinster, fol.54, a2, and b1): Nemain is an Irish goddess who is very powerful. Nemain can kill 100 men with just one single battle cry.
&quot;He saw from him the ardent sparkling of the bright golden weapons over the heads of the four great provinces of Eriu, before the fall of the cloud of evening. Great fury and indignation seized him on seeing them, at the number of his opponents and at the multitude of his enemies. He seized his two spears, and his shield and his sword, and uttered from his throat a warrior&#x27;s shout, so that sprites, and satyrs, and maniacs of the valley, and the demons of the air responded, terror-stricken by the shout which he had raised on high. And the Neman confused the army; and the four provinces of Eriu dashed themselves against the points of their own spears and weapons, so that one hundred warriors died of fear and trembling in the middle of the fort and encampment that night.&quot;
==Kinship==
In Cormac&#x27;s glossary, Nemain is said to have been the wife of Neit, &quot;the god of battle with the pagan Gaeidhel&quot;.
A poem in the Book of Leinster (fol. 6, a2), couples Badb and Nemain as the wives of Neid or Neit:—

“Neit son of Indu, and his two wives,
Badb and Neamin, truly,
Were slain in Ailech, without blemish,
By Neptur of the Fomorians”.

At folio 5, a2, of the same MS., Fea and Nemain are said to have been Neit’s two wives but in the poem on Ailech printed from the Dinnsenchus in the &quot;Ordinance Memoir of Templemore&quot; (p. 226), Nemain only is mentioned as the wife of Neit. Also, in the Irish books of genealogy, both Fea and Nemain are said to have been the two daughters of Elcmar of the Brugh (Newgrange, near the Boyne), who was the son of Delbaeth, son of Ogma, son of Elatan, and the wives of Neid son of Indae. This identical kinship of Fea and Nemain implies that the two are one and the same personality.

In the Dindsenchas, Nemain &quot;of the wounds of war&quot; is described as the &quot;law-giver wife&quot; of Neit.

==Etymology==
The variant forms in which her name appears in Irish texts are &quot;Nemon ~ Nemain ~ Neman.&quot; These alternations imply that the Proto-Celtic form of this theonym, if such a theonym existed at that stage, would have been *&quot;Nemānjā&quot;, *&quot;Nemani-s&quot; or *&quot;Nemoni-s&quot;.

The meaning of the name has been glossed in various ways. Squire (2000:45) glossed the name as &#x27;venomous&#x27; presumably relating it to the Proto-Celtic *&quot;nemi-&quot; &#x27;dose of poison&#x27; &#x27;something which is dealt out&#x27; from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;nem-&quot; &#x27;deal out&#x27; (Old Irish &quot;nem&quot;, pl. &quot;neimi&quot; &#x27;poison&#x27; ). However, *&quot;nemi-&quot; is clearly an &quot;i&quot;-stem noun whereas the stems of the reconstructed forms *&quot;Nemā-njā&quot;, *&quot;Nema-ni-s&quot; and *&quot;Nemo-ni-s&quot; are clearly &quot;a&quot;-stem and &quot;o&quot;-stem nouns respectively.

Equally, the Proto-Celtic &quot;*nāmant-&quot; &#x27;enemy&#x27; (Irish &quot;námhaid&quot;, genitive &quot;namhad&quot; &#x27;enemy&#x27; from the Old Irish &quot;náma&quot;, g. &quot;námat&quot;, pl.n. &quot;námait&quot; ) is too different in form from *&quot;Nemānjā&quot;, *&quot;Nemani-s&quot; or *&quot;Nemoni-s&quot; to be equated with any of them.

The name may plausibly be an extended form of the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*nem-&quot; &#x27;seize, take, deal out&#x27;, to which is related the Ancient Greek &quot;Némesis&quot; &#x27;wrath, nemesis&#x27; and the name &quot;Nemesis&quot;, the personification of retributive justice in Greek mythology. This is related to the Ancient Greek Nomos, which means a custom or law, and also means to divide, distribute, or to allot. The Proto-Indo-European root is the Old High German &quot;nâma&quot; &#x27;rapine,&#x27; German &quot;nehmen&quot;, &#x27;take,&#x27; English &quot;nimble&quot;; Zend &quot;nemanh&quot; &#x27;crime,&#x27; Albanian &quot;name&quot; &#x27;a curse&#x27; and the Welsh, Cornish, and Breton &quot;nam&quot;, &#x27;blame&#x27; . According to this theory, the name would mean something like &#x27;the Great Taker&#x27; or the &#x27;Great Allotter.&#x27;

<text>The Hill of Tara ( or ) is a hill and ancient ceremonial and burial site near Skryne in County Meath, Ireland. Tradition identifies the hill as the inauguration place and seat of the High Kings of Ireland; it also appears in Irish mythology. Tara consists of numerous monuments and earthworks—dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age—including a passage tomb (the &quot;Mound of the Hostages&quot;), burial mounds, round enclosures, a standing stone (believed to be the &quot;Lia Fáil&quot; or &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;), and a ceremonial avenue. There is also a church and graveyard on the hill. Tara forms part of a larger ancient landscape and Tara itself is a protected national monument under the care of the Office of Public Works, an agency of the Irish Government.

==Name==
The name &quot;Tara&quot; is an anglicization of the Irish name or (&#x27;hill of Tara&#x27;). It is also known as (&#x27;Tara of the kings&#x27;), and formerly also (&#x27;the grey ridge&#x27;). The Old Irish form is . It is believed this comes from Proto-Celtic and means a &#x27;sanctuary&#x27; or &#x27;sacred space&#x27; cut off for ceremony, cognate with the Greek () and Latin . Another suggestion is that it means &quot;a height with a view&quot;.

==Early history==

===Ancient monuments===

The remains of twenty ancient monuments are visible, and at least three times that many have been found through geophysical surveys and aerial photography.

The oldest visible monument is (the &#x27;Mound of the Hostages&#x27;), a Neolithic passage tomb built around 3,200 BC. It holds the remains of hundreds of people, most of which are cremated bones. In the Neolithic, it was the communal tomb of a single community for about a century, during which there were almost 300 burials. Almost a millennium later, in the Bronze Age, there were a further 33 burials – first in the passage and then in the mound around it. During this time, only certain high-status individuals were buried there. At first, it was the tomb of one community, but later multiple communities came together to bury their elite there. The last burial was a full body burial of a young man of high status, with an ornate necklace and dagger.

During the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age, a huge double timber circle or &quot;wood henge&quot; was built on the hilltop. It was 250m in diameter and surrounded the Mound of the Hostages. At least six smaller burial mounds were built in an arc around this timber circle, including those known as , , (&#x27;Mound of the Mercenary Women&#x27;) and (&#x27;Mound of the Cow&#x27;). The timber circle was eventually either removed or decayed, and the burial mounds are barely visible today.

There are several large round enclosures on the hill, which were built in the Iron Age. The biggest and most central of these is Ráth na Ríogh (the Enclosure of the Kings), which measures in circumference, north-south by east-west, with an inner ditch and outer bank. It is dated to the 1st century BC and was originally marked out by a stakewall. Human burials, and a high concentration of horse and dog bones, were found in the ditch. Within the is the Mound of the Hostages and two round, double-ditched enclosures which together make a figure-of-eight shape. One is (&#x27;Cormac&#x27;s House&#x27;) and the other is the or Royal Seat, which incorporates earlier burial mounds. On top of the is a standing stone, which is believed to be the (&#x27;Stone of Destiny&#x27;) at which the High Kings were crowned. According to legend, the stone would let out a roar when the rightful king touched it. It is believed that the stone originally lay beside or on top of the Mound of the Hostages.

Just to the north of , is (the &#x27;Rath of the Synods&#x27;), which was built in the middle of the former &quot;wood henge&quot;. It is a round enclosure with four rings of ditches and banks, and incorporates earlier burial mounds. It was re-modelled several times and once had a large timber building inside it, resembling the one at Navan. It was occupied between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, and Roman artefacts were also found there. It was badly mutilated in the early 20th century by British Israelites searching for the Ark of the Covenant.

The other round enclosures are (&#x27;Laoghaire&#x27;s Fort&#x27;, where the eponymous king is said to have been buried) at the southern edge of the hill, and the (&#x27;Sloping Trenches&#x27; or &#x27;Sloping Graves&#x27;) at the northwestern edge, which includes and . The are burial mounds with ring ditches around them which sit on a slope.

At the northern end of the hill is or &#x27;Banqueting Hall&#x27;. This was likely the ceremonial avenue leading to the hilltop and seems to have been one of the last monuments built.

Half a mile south of the Hill of Tara is another large round enclosure known as Rath Meave, which refers to the legendary figure Medb or Medb Lethderg.

===Annals===
In the Annals of Inisfallen (AI980.4) is a description of the Battle of Tara between Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill and the son of Amlaíb Cuarán.

===Church===
A church, called Saint Patrick&#x27;s, is on the eastern side of the hilltop. The &quot;Rath of the Synods&quot; has been partly destroyed by its churchyard. The modern church was built in 1822–23 on the site of an earlier one.

The earliest evidence of a church at Tara is a charter dating from the 1190s. In 1212, this church was &quot;among the possessions confirmed to the Knights Hospitallers of Saint John of Kilmainham by Pope Innocent III&quot;. A 1791 illustration shows the church building internally divided into a nave and chancel, with a bell-tower over the western end. A stump of wall marks the site of the old church today, but some of its stonework was re-used in the current church.

The building is now used as a visitor centre, operated by the Office of Public Works (OPW), an agency of the Irish Government.

===The Five Roads of Tara===
According to legend, five ancient roads or meet at Tara, linking it with all the provinces of Ireland. The earliest reference to the five roads of Tara was in the tale (The Destruction of Da Derga&#x27;s Hall).

The five roads are said to be:

* , which went west towards Lough Owel, then to Rathcroghan.
* , which went to Slane, then to Navan Fort, ending at Dunseverick.
* , which went through Dublin and through the old district of Cualann towards Waterford.
* , which went towards and through Ossory.
* (&#x27;Great Highway&#x27;), which roughly followed the Esker Riada to County Galway.

==Significance==

The passage of the Mound of the Hostages is aligned with the sunrise around the times of Samhain (the Gaelic festival marking the start of winter) and Imbolc (the festival marking the start of spring). The passage is shorter than monuments like Newgrange, making it less precise in providing alignments with the Sun, but Martin Brennan writes in &quot;The Stones of Time&quot; that &quot;daily changes in the position of a 13-foot long sunbeam are more than adequate to determine specific dates&quot;. Early Irish literature records that a royal gathering called the &#x27;feast of Tara&#x27; (&quot;feis Temro&quot;) was held there at Samhain.

By the beginning of Ireland&#x27;s historical period, Tara had become the seat of a sacral kingship. Historian Dáibhí Ó Cróinín writes that Tara &quot;possessed an aura that seemed to set it above&quot; the other royal seats. It is recorded as the seat of the High King of Ireland (&quot;Ard Rí&quot;) and is &quot;central to most of the great drama in early Irish literature&quot;. Various medieval king lists traced a line of High Kings far into the past. However, John T. Koch explains: &quot;Although the kingship of Tara was a special kingship whose occupants had aspirations towards supremacy among the kings of Ireland, in political terms it is unlikely that any king had sufficient authority to dominate the whole island before the 9th century&quot;.

Irish legend says that the Lia Fáil (Stone of Destiny) at Tara was brought to Ireland by the divine Tuatha Dé Danann, and that it would cry out under the foot of the true king. Medb Lethderg was the sovereignty goddess of Tara. The cult of the sacral kingship of Tara is reflected in the legends of High King Conaire Mór, while another legendary High King, Cormac mac Airt, is presented as the ideal king. The reign of Diarmait mac Cerbaill, a historical king of Tara in the sixth century, was seen as particularly important by medieval writers. Although he was probably pagan, he was also influenced by Christian leaders and &quot;stood chronologically between two worlds, the ancient pagan one and the new Christian one&quot;.

Tara was probably controlled by the Érainn before it was seized by the Laigin in the third century. Niall of the Nine Hostages displaced the Laigin from Tara in the fifth century and it became the ceremonial seat of the Uí Néill. The kingship of Tara alternated between the Southern and Northern Uí Néill until the eleventh century. After this, control of Dublin, Limerick, and Waterford became more important to a would-be High King than control of Tara.

According to Irish mythology, during the third century a great battle known as the Cath Gabhra took place between High King Cairbre Lifechair, and the Fianna led by Fionn Mac Cumhaill. The Fianna were heavily defeated; many of the graves of the Fianna covered the Rath of the Gabhra, most notably the grave of Oscar, son of Oisín.

==Later history==
During the rebellion of 1798, United Irishmen formed a camp on the hill but were attacked and defeated by British troops on 26 May 1798 and the was allegedly moved to commemorate the 400 rebels who died on the hill that day.

In 1843, the Irish nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell hosted a peaceful political demonstration at Tara in favour of Irish self-governance which drew over 750,000 people, highlighting the lasting significance of Tara.

British Prime Minister John Russell inherited the Tara estate during the 19th century. At the turn of the 20th century, Tara was vandalised by British Israelists who thought that the British were part of the Lost Tribes of Israel and that the hill contained the Ark of the Covenant. A group of British Israelists, led by retired Anglo-Indian judge Edward Wheeler Bird, set about excavating the site having paid off the landowner, Gustavus Villiers Briscoe. Irish cultural nationalists held a mass protest over the destruction of the national heritage site, including Douglas Hyde, Arthur Griffith, Maud Gonne, George Moore and W. B. Yeats. Hyde tried to interrupt the dig but was ordered away by a man wielding a rifle. Maud Gonne made a more flamboyant protest by relighting an old bonfire that Briscoe had lit to celebrate the coronation of Edward VII. She began to sing Thomas Davis&#x27;s song &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; by the fire, much to the consternation of the landlord and the police.

The Irish government bought the southern part of the hill in 1952, and the northern part in 1972.

The religious order Missionary Society of St. Columban had its international headquarters at Dalgan Park, just north of the Hill of Tara. The order was named after the Saint who was born in the Ancient Kingdom of Meath. The land Dalgan Park lies on was once owned by the kings of Tara. The seminary is also situated on the path of the , one of the five ancient roads that meet at Tara.

===Motorway development===
The M3 motorway passes through the Tara-Skryne Valley – as did the existing N3 road. Protesters argue that since the Tara Discovery Programme started in 1992, there is an appreciation that the Hill of Tara is just the central complex of a wider landscape. The distance between the motorway and the hill is – it intersects the old N3 at the Blundelstown interchange between the Hill of Tara and the Hill of Skryne. Protesters said that an alternative route about west of Tara would have been straighter, cheaper and less destructive.
On Sunday 23 September 2007 over 1500 people met on the Hill of Tara to take part in a human sculpture representing a harp and spelling out the words &quot;SAVE TARA VALLEY&quot; as a call for the re-routing of the M3 motorway away from Tara. Actors Stuart Townsend and Jonathan Rhys Meyers attended this event. There was also a letter writing campaign to preserve the Hill of Tara.

The Hill of Tara was included in the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world. The following year it was included in a list of the 15 must-see endangered cultural treasures by the Smithsonian Institution.

The motorway project proceeded, and the road was opened in June 2010.

<text>Jihlava (; ) is a city in the Czech Republic. It has about 54,000 inhabitants. Jihlava is the capital of the Vysočina Region, situated on the Jihlava River on the historical border between Moravia and Bohemia.

Historically, Jihlava is the oldest mining town in the Czech Republic, older than Kutná Hora. The historic centre of Jihlava is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Jihlava consists of 17 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

==Etymology==
The origin of the Jihlava&#x27;s name (&quot;Iglau&quot; in German) is unclear. The most common theory has it derived from the German word &quot;Igel&quot;, meaning &#x27;hedgehog&#x27;, usually in reference to the city&#x27;s coat of arms. However, the name was in use since before the symbol of a hedgehog was. It is more likely the city is named for the river that flows through it, the name of which is also unclear in its origin, either being derived from the German word &quot;Igel&quot; as the first theory suggests, or from the Slavic word &quot;jehla&quot; (i.e. &#x27;needle&#x27;), referring to sharp stones in the Jihlava river bed.

==Geography==

Jihlava is located about southeast of Prague and northwest of Brno. The city is situated on the historical border between Moravia and Bohemia; most of the city lies in Moravia.

Jihlava lies on the Jihlava River, at its confluence with the Jihlávka Stream. The municipal territory is rich in small fishponds.

Jihlava is located in the heart of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. The northern part of the territory lies in the Upper Sázava Hills and the southern part lies in the Křižanov Highlands. The highest point is the hill Popický vrch with an elevation of , located on the southern municipal border.

===Climate===
==History==
===13th–14th centuries===
Jihlava was originally a Slavic market village with a small Church of Saint John the Baptist, established on a trade route around 1200. The first written mention of Jihlava is from 1233. The mining of silver began here in 1234 and the royal mining town was established between 1233 and 1240. Jihlava thus became the oldest mining town in what is today the Czech Republic.

The village was originally located on the left bank of the river Jihlava, but with the expansion of mining and the influx of inhabitants, the town spread to the right bank, where its historic centre was established. The regular plan of the rectangular network of streets with a large square in the middle was given by the building regulations of King Ottokar II from 1270. Royal privileges guaranteed prosperity and Jihlava soon became one of the most powerful cities in the kingdom. It was protected by a massive fortification and coins were minted here. It became the first city in Central Europe where mining law was codified.

Mining attracted settlers from Bavaria, Saxony and other German-speaking regions to the city. Gradually a large German-speaking community was established here.

===15th–19th centuries===

At the end of the 14th century, the importance of mining declined when the richest deposits were mined, and Jihlava instead became a centre of trade and crafts, especially cloth making.

In the era of the Hussite Wars, Jihlava remained a Catholic stronghold and managed to resist a number of sieges. On 5 July 1436, a treaty was made with the Hussites here, whereby the Emperor Sigismund was acknowledged king of Bohemia. A marble relief near the city marks the spot where Ferdinand I, in 1527, swore fidelity to the Bohemian estates.

In 1523, a large fire severely damaged the city, which was subsequently restored in the Renaissance style. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Jihlava was twice captured by the Swedish troops. The suburbs were burned, most of the houses were demolished, and the city significantly depopulated. Jihlava recovered only after more than 100 years. The city was restored in the Baroque style and began to develop again.

In 1742, it fell into the hands of the Prussians, and in December 1805 the Bavarians under Karl Philipp von Wrede were defeated near the city.

In the second half of the 18th century, Jihlava was the second largest producer of cloth in the Austrian Empire. At that time the city expanded beyond the city walls. The city gates with narrow passages were demolished at the beginning of the 19th century, and the façades of the houses were remodeled in the Neoclassical style.

===20th century===
From an ethnic point of view, the city was half-German (about 54% in 1921) and half-Czech, but mostly German was spoken here. The city and its surroundings constituted a German-speaking enclave within Czech-speaking Bohemia and Moravia, so-called Jihlava language island. After World War I and the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the Germans demanded the annexation of the German language island to Austria. But the Austrian parliament itself rejected their request, so they had to adapt. In the 1920 election, German parties won a majority.

The relatively peaceful coexistence of the Czech and German-speaking inhabitants that lasted for hundreds of years ended with the nationalism caused by the Sudeten German Party of Konrad Henlein, which raised in 1933.

The Jewish synagogue, built in 1862–1863, was burnt down in 1939. Most of Jihlava&#x27;s Jewish population, which numbered over 1,000 people, was deported and killed due to the Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia. After the end of World War II, starting from 9 May 1945, German-speakers were banned from using public transportation and were ordered to carry white armbands identifying them as Germans. Following the Beneš decrees, most of the German-speakers were expelled.

Between 1950 and 1952, Jihlava was the site of several show trials of Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which were directed against the influence of the Catholic Church on the rural population. In the processes eleven death sentences were passed. All the convicted persons were rehabilitated after the Velvet Revolution.

In 1969, in protest against the normalization in Czechoslovakia, Evžen Plocek set himself on fire on the city square in emulation of others in Prague. Today there is a memorial plaque to him.

On 6 June 1991, after the collapse of centrally-planned socialist economy, the first ever supermarket in now-capitalist Czechoslovakia opened in Jihlava.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The industry in Jihlava is mainly focused on the production of machines and components for the automotive industry. The largest company based in the city is Bosch Diesel, a subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH. The company employs about 4,000 people and is among the largest employers in the region. It manufactures components for diesel injection pump.

Other important industrial companies include Marelli Automotive Lighting Jihlava (a producer of automotive lighting) and Motorpal, a manufacturer of injection pumps founded in 1946.

The most important non-industrial employers include the Jihlava Hospital and the Jihlava Psychiatric Hospital.

The Jihlava agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 98,000 inhabitants.

==Transport==

The D1 motorway (part of the European routes E50 and E65) runs through the northern part of the territory of Jihlava and thus the city has excellent road connection with other regions of the Czech Republic. The I/38 road (the section from Znojmo to Havlíčkův Brod, part of the European route E59) passes through the city proper.

Jihlava is the terminus and starting point of the railway lines from/to Brno, Třebíč and Tábor. It also lies on the line Havlíčkův Brod–Slavonice. The territory of Jihlava is served by four train stations: &quot;Jihlava&quot;, &quot;Jihlava město&quot;, &quot;Jihlava-Staré Hory&quot; and &quot;Jihlava-Bosch Diesel&quot;.

Intra-city transport is provided by the company Dopravní podnik města Jihlavy a.s., which is owned by the city of Jihlava. In addition to buses, trolleybuses also provide intra-city transport. Trolleybus service was started in 1948. There are 6 trolleybus lines in operation with a total length of .

==Education==
In 2004, the College of Polytechnics Jihlava was founded. In 2022, it had more than 2,100 students.

==Culture==
Since 1997, the Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival has been held in Jihlava every year.

==Sport==
The city&#x27;s football club is FC Vysočina Jihlava. The club plays mostly in the Czech National Football League (second tier).

The local ice hockey club, HC Dukla Jihlava, was successful between 1966 and 1991, however in recent decades it plays mostly in the 1st Czech Republic Hockey League (second tier).

==Sights==

Thanks to its building development, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings are located next to each other in Jihlava. The historic centre is formed by Masarykovo Square and its surroundings. In the past it was delimited by walls, some of which have been preserved to this day. The zwinger was modified into a park. The only surviving gate of the five is the Gate of the Holy Mother.

The square is the third largest city square in the country with an area of . In the middle of the square is a plague column from 1690 and two fountains from 1797.

The landmarks of the square are the city hall and Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. The city hall with Gothic core has served its purpose since 1425. It was rebuilt and extended several times. In the mid-16th century, a turret with clock was added, a Gothic hall was established and the façade was decorated by a large Renaissance fresco. In 1786, the second floor was added, the fresco was overlayed by new façade, and the large Gothic hall was split in half by the wall.

Jihlava Zoo was founded in 1982. It breeds about 250 species of animals.

===Ecclesiastical monuments===
The early Gothic Church of Saint James the Great from the 13th century is one of the symbols of Jihlava. The Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows was added to the church in 1702. In 1725, the church became a parish church. It has two towers, and high. The higher tower is open to the public as a lookout tower. The bell in the belltower called Zuzana is the second largest bell in Moravia.

The oldest church is the Church of Saint John the Baptist. It was founded around 1200 together with the original village on the left bank of the Jihlava River. It was rebuilt several times, its current appearance is a result of Baroque reconstruction from the late 18th century.

The Friars Minor Church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary was built after 1250. Today the originally Gothic church has a Baroque appearance. Since 1784, it has been a parish church.

The Church of Saint Ignatius of Loyola on the city square was built in the early Baroque style in 1683–1689 for the Jesuits. Next to the church is a former Jesuit dormitory built in 1699–1711.

The Dominican Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross was founded in 1247. The Church of the Holy Spirit was built in the Renaissance style in 1547 and rebuilt in the Mannerist style in 1661. The Evangelical Church of Saint Paul is a neo-Gothic building, built in 1875–1878.

<doc id="241140" wikidata="Q5346806" url="?curid=241140" title="Edwin Sandys (1561–1629)">
<text>Sir Edwin Sandys ( ; 9 December 1561 – October 1629) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1589 and 1626. He was also one of the founders of the proprietary Virginia Company of London, which in 1607 established the first permanent English settlement in what is now the United States in the colony of Virginia, based at Jamestown. The parish of Sandys, in Bermuda (the Virginia Company&#x27;s second colony) is named after him.

==Early life and career==
Sandys (pronounced &quot;Sands&quot;) was born in Worcestershire, the second son of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York, and his wife Cecily Wilford. He received his education at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, which he entered in 1571, and at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, (from 1577). He graduated B.A. in 1579 and was admitted fellow in the same year and B.C.L. in 1589. At Oxford his tutor was Richard Hooker, author of the &quot;Ecclesiastical Polity&quot;, whose lifelong friend and executor Sandys became. Sandys is said to have had a large share in securing the Mastership of the Temple Church in London for Hooker. In 1582 Sandys&#x27; father gave him the prebend of Wetwang in York Minster, but he never took orders, later resigning both his fellowship and prebendary. In 1589 he was elected Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle. He entered in the Middle Temple in 1589. In 1593 he was re-elected MP for Plympton Erle.
From 1593 to 1599 Sandys travelled abroad. When in Venice he became closely connected with Fra Paolo Sarpi, who helped him compose the treatise on the religious state of Europe, known as the &quot;Europae speculum&quot;. In 1605 this treatise was printed from a stolen copy under the title &quot;A Relation of the State of Religion in Europe&quot;. Sandys procured the suppression of this edition, but the book was reprinted at The Hague in 1629.

After 1599, in view of the approaching death of Queen Elizabeth I, Sandys paid his court to King James VI of Scotland, and on James&#x27;s accession to the throne of England in 1603 Sandys received a knighthood.

==Career as MP==
In 1604, he sat in James&#x27;s first parliament as MP for Stockbridge, and distinguished himself as one of the assailants of the great monopolies. He endeavoured to secure to all prisoners the right of employing counsel, a proposal which was resisted by some lawyers as subversive of the administration of the law.

In 1614 he was elected MP for Rochester. He was appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1615-1616 - his country seat of Northborne was there.

Sandys sat in the later parliaments of James I as MP for Sandwich in 1621, and for Kent in 1624.

On 16 June 1621 he and John Selden were taken into custody by order of the House of Commons, and not released until 18 July.

His tendencies were towards opposition, and he was suspected of hostility to the court; but he disarmed the anger of the king by professions of obedience. He was member for Penryn in the first parliament of Charles I in 1625 and again in 1626.

==Role in the Virginia Company==

Sandys had been connected with the East India Company before 1614, and took an active part in its affairs until 1629. His most memorable services were, however, rendered to the Virginia Company of London, to which he became treasurer in 1619 (succeeding Thomas Smythe). He instituted a program designed to give investors and settlers incentive to emigrate to the New World. His program granted some of Virginia&#x27;s land to the people who chose to live there, providing &quot;ancient planters&quot; who had arrived before 1616 with one hundred acres each with settlers coming after 1616 getting fifty acres. He also sent several hundred tenant farmers to work land set aside for the company while urging the production of more than just tobacco for export.

In order to increase labour in Virginia, his program also promoted indentured servitude for the poor of England who could try to make a better life for themselves in the colony. These policies created a boom period of growth for Virginia. The large amount of labour available and the condition by which they made the journey led to exploitation of servants and tenants while allowing large farmer owners to also exploit the Virginia Company.

Sandys also strongly supported the headright system, for his goal was a permanent colony which would enlarge English territory, relieve the nation&#x27;s overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Also accredited to Sandys is an increase in women sent to the colonies, for the purpose of encouraging men to marry &quot;tobacco brides&quot; and start families, which ostensibly would motivate them to work harder.
Edwin Sandys was also one of the men instrumental in establishing the first representative assembly in the new world at Jamestown by issuing a new charter calling for its establishment. In addition, he assisted the Pilgrims in establishing their colony at Plymouth, Massachusetts by lending them 300 pounds without interest. This led to Sandys being accused in 1624 by Sir Nathaniel Rich of having republican sympathies and of trying to establish a &#x27;Brownist Republic&#x27; in Virginia. This was an accusation not entirely without foundation, as the colonial project had from the outset quasi-republican overtones.

Although Sandys never travelled to Virginia, he worked tirelessly in England to support the effort. He promoted and supported the policy which enabled the colony to survive the disasters of its early days, and, he continued to be a leading influence in the Company until it was dissolved in 1624.

Although the Virginia Company ultimately failed financially by 1624, the colony eventually grew and prospered until achieving independence late in the 18th century following the American Revolutionary War.

Sandys&#x27; brother Thomas Sands (Sandys) was one of the first colonist in Jamestown, he survived the &quot;Starving Times&quot; and later returned to England.

==Theological positions==
Edwin Sandys shared with his brother George a leaning toward English Arminian theology and rejected Calvinist predestinarianism. Through his writings he also positioned himself theologically, and is described as a proto-Arminian. Because of his anti-Calvinist views, he won the attention of the leading Dutch Arminian Hugo Grotius.

==Later life and legacy==
Sandys died in October 1629, leaving a £1500 endowment to the University of Oxford to fund a lecture in metaphysics.

Sandys is buried in Northbourne Church in Kent with his last wife Catherine.

==Family==
Sandys was married four times:

Sandys&#x27; great-grandson Richard Sandys became a baronet in 1684. His brother Sir Miles Sandys, 1st Baronet was also appointed a baronet, and sat as MP, and was High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire.
Sandys Parish, Bermuda, which includes Somerset Village and the Royal Naval Dockyard, is named after him.

<doc id="241141" wikidata="Q170718" url="?curid=241141" title="European bee-eater">
<text>The European bee-eater (Merops apiaster) is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family, Meropidae. It breeds in southern and central Europe, northern and southern Africa, and western Asia. Except for the resident southern African population, the species is strongly migratory, wintering in tropical Africa. This species occurs as a spring overshoot north of its usual range, with occasional breeding in northern Europe.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The European bee-eater was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name &quot;Merops apiaster&quot;. The genus name &quot;Merops&quot; is Ancient Greek for &quot;bee-eater&quot;, and &quot;apiaster&quot; is Latin, also meaning &quot;bee-eater&quot;, from &quot;apis&quot;, &quot;bee&quot;.

== Description ==
This species, like other bee-eaters, is a richly coloured, slender bird. It has brown and yellow upper parts, whilst the wings are green and the beak is black. It can reach a length of , including the two elongated central tail feathers, and weigh 44–78 g (52 g on average). Sexes are alike. Female tends to have greener rather than gold feathers on shoulders. Non-breeding plumage is much duller and with a blue-green back and no elongated central tail feathers. Juvenile resembles a non-breeding adult, but with less variation in the feather colours. Adults begin to moult in June or July and complete the process by August or September. There is a further moult into breeding plumage in winter in Africa.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

===Breeding===
These bee-eaters are gregarious—nesting colonially in sandy banks, preferably near river shores, usually at the beginning of May. They make a relatively long tunnel, in which they lay five to eight spherical white eggs around the beginning of June. Both male and female care for the eggs, which they brood for about three weeks. They also feed and roost communally.

During courtship, the male feeds large items to the female while eating the small ones himself. Most males are monogamous, but occasional bigamy has been encountered. Their typical call is a distinctive, mellow, liquid and burry &quot;prreee&quot; or &quot;prruup&quot;.

=== Feeding ===
This bird breeds in open country in warmer climates. As the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps, and hornets. They catch insects in flight, in sorties from an open perch. Before eating a bee, the European bee-eater removes the sting by repeatedly hitting the insect on a hard surface. It can eat around 250 bees a day.

The most important prey item in their diet is Hymenoptera, mostly the European honey bee. A study in Spain found that these comprise 69.4% to 82% of the European bee-eaters&#x27; diet. Their impact on bee populations, however, is small. They eat less than 1% of the worker bees in areas where they live.

A study found that European bee-eaters &quot;convert food to body weight more efficiently if they are fed a mixture of bees and dragonflies than if they eat only bees or only dragonflies.&quot;

=== Predation of honey bees ===
If an apiary is set up close to a bee-eater colony, a larger number of honey bees are eaten because they are more abundant. However, studies show the bee-eaters do not intentionally fly into the apiary, rather they feed on the insects caught on pastures and meadows within a radius of from the colony, this maximum distance being reached only when there is a lack of food. Observations show that the birds actually enter the apiary only in cold and rainy periods, when the bees do not leave the hive and other insect prey are harder for the bee-eaters to detect.

Many bee-keepers believe that the bee-eaters are the main obstacle causing worker bees not to forage, and instead stay inside the hives for much of the day between May and the end of August. However, a study carried out in eucalyptus forest in the Alalous region, east of Tripoli, Libya, showed that the bee-eaters were not the main obstacle of bee foraging, which is the opposite of what beekeepers think. The foraging rate was higher in presence of the birds than in their absence in some cases. The average bird meal consisted of 90.8% honey bees and 9.2% beetles.

Predation is more likely when the bees are queening or during peak migrations, from late March till mid-April, and in mid-September. Hives close to or under trees or overhead cables are also at increased risk as the birds pounce on flying insects from these perches.

<text>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. During the second half of 2007, XSSed documented 11,253 site-specific cross-site vulnerabilities, compared to 2,134 &quot;traditional&quot; vulnerabilities documented by Symantec. XSS effects vary in 
range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site&#x27;s owner network.

OWASP considers the term cross-site scripting to be a misnomer. It initially was an attack that was used for breaching data across sites, but gradually started to include other forms of data injection attacks.

==Background==

Security on the web depends on a variety of mechanisms, including an underlying concept of trust known as the same-origin policy. This states that if content from one site (such as &quot;https://mybank.example1.com&quot;) is granted permission to access resources (like cookies etc.) on a web browser, then content from any URL with the same (1) URI scheme (e.g. ftp, http, or https), (2) host name, &quot;and&quot; (3) port number will share these permissions. Content from URLs where any of these three attributes are different will have to be granted permissions separately.

Cross-site scripting attacks use known vulnerabilities in web-based applications, their servers, or the plug-in systems on which they rely. Exploiting one of these, attackers fold malicious content into the content being delivered from the compromised site. When the resulting combined content arrives at the client-side web browser, it has all been delivered from the trusted source, and thus operates under the permissions granted to that system. By finding ways of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, an attacker can gain elevated access-privileges to sensitive page content, to session cookies, and to a variety of other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the user. Cross-site scripting attacks are a case of code injection.

Microsoft security-engineers introduced the term &quot;cross-site scripting&quot; in January 2000. The expression &quot;cross-site scripting&quot; originally referred to the act of loading the attacked, third-party web application from an unrelated attack-site, in a manner that executes a fragment of JavaScript prepared by the attacker in the security context of the targeted domain (taking advantage of a &quot;reflected&quot; or &quot;non-persistent&quot; XSS vulnerability). The definition gradually expanded to encompass other modes of code injection, including persistent and non-JavaScript vectors (including ActiveX, Java, VBScript, Flash, or even HTML scripts), causing some confusion to newcomers to the field of information security.

XSS vulnerabilities have been reported and exploited since the 1990s. Prominent sites affected in the past include the social-networking sites Twitter and 
Facebook. Cross-site scripting flaws have since surpassed buffer overflows to become the most common publicly reported security vulnerability, with some researchers in 2007 estimating as many as 68% of websites are likely open to XSS attacks.

==Types==
There is no single, standardized classification of cross-site scripting flaws, but most experts distinguish between at least two primary flavors of XSS flaws: &quot;non-persistent&quot; and &quot;persistent&quot;. Some sources further divide these two groups into &quot;traditional&quot; (caused by server-side code flaws) and &quot;DOM-based&quot; (in client-side code).

===Non-persistent (reflected)===
The &quot;non-persistent&quot; (or &quot;reflected&quot;) cross-site scripting vulnerability is by far the most basic type of web vulnerability. These holes show up when the data provided by a web client, most commonly in HTTP query parameters (e.g. HTML form submission), is used immediately by server-side scripts to parse and display a page of results for and to that user, without properly sanitizing the content.

Because HTML documents have a flat, serial structure that mixes control statements, formatting, and the actual content, any non-validated user-supplied data included in the resulting page without proper HTML encoding, may lead to markup injection. A classic example of a potential vector is a site search engine: if one searches for a string, the search string will typically be redisplayed verbatim on the result page to indicate what was searched for. If this response does not properly escape or reject HTML control characters, a cross-site scripting flaw will ensue.

A reflected attack is typically delivered via email or a neutral web site. The bait is an innocent-looking URL, pointing to a trusted site but containing the XSS vector. If the trusted site is vulnerable to the vector, clicking the link can cause the victim&#x27;s browser to execute the injected script.

===Persistent (or stored)===
The &quot;persistent&quot; (or &quot;stored&quot;) XSS vulnerability is a more devastating variant of a cross-site scripting flaw: it occurs when the data provided by the attacker is saved by the server, and then permanently displayed on &quot;normal&quot; pages returned to other users in the course of regular browsing, without proper HTML escaping. A classic example of this is with online message boards where users are allowed to post HTML formatted messages for other users to read.

For example, suppose there is a dating website where members scan the profiles of other members to see if they look interesting. For privacy reasons, this site hides everybody&#x27;s real name and email. These are kept secret on the server. The only time a member&#x27;s real name and email are in the browser is when the member is signed in, and they can&#x27;t see anyone else&#x27;s.

Suppose that Mallory, an attacker, joins the site and wants to figure out the real names of the people she sees on the site. To do so, she writes a script designed to run from other users&#x27; browsers when &quot;they&quot; visit &quot;her&quot; profile. The script then sends a quick message to her own server, which collects this information.

To do this, for the question &quot;Describe your Ideal First Date&quot;, Mallory gives a short answer (to appear normal), but the text at the end of her answer is her script to steal names and emails. If the script is enclosed inside a codice_1 element, it won&#x27;t be shown on the screen. Then suppose that Bob, a member of the dating site, reaches Mallory&#x27;s profile, which has her answer to the First Date question. Her script is run automatically by the browser and steals a copy of Bob&#x27;s real name and email directly from his own machine.

Persistent XSS vulnerabilities can be more significant than other types because an attacker&#x27;s malicious script is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims or lure them to a third-party website. Particularly in the case of social networking sites, the code would be further designed to self-propagate across accounts, creating a type of client-side worm.

The methods of injection can vary a great deal; in some cases, the attacker may not even need to directly interact with the web functionality itself to exploit such a hole. Any data received by the web application (via email, system logs, IM etc.) that can be controlled by an attacker could become an injection vector.

===Server-side versus DOM-based vulnerabilities===
XSS vulnerabilities were originally found in applications that performed all data processing on the server side. User input (including an XSS vector) would be sent to the server, and then sent back to the user as a web page. The need for an improved user experience resulted in popularity of applications that had a majority of the presentation logic (maybe written in JavaScript) working on the client-side that pulled data, on-demand, from the server using AJAX.

As the JavaScript code was also processing user input and rendering it in the web page content, a new sub-class of reflected XSS attacks started to appear that was called &quot;DOM-based cross-site scripting&quot;. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious data does not touch the web server. Rather, it is being reflected by the JavaScript code, fully on the client side.

An example of a DOM-based XSS vulnerability is the bug found in 2011 in a number of jQuery plugins. Prevention strategies for DOM-based XSS attacks include very similar measures to traditional XSS prevention strategies but implemented in JavaScript code and contained in web pages (i.e. input validation and escaping). Some JavaScript frameworks have built-in countermeasures against this and other types of attack — for example AngularJS.

===Self-XSS===
Self-XSS is a form of XSS vulnerability that relies on social engineering in order to trick the victim into executing malicious JavaScript code in their browser. Although it is technically not a true XSS vulnerability due to the fact it relies on socially engineering a user into executing code rather than a flaw in the affected website allowing an attacker to do so, it still poses the same risks as a regular XSS vulnerability if properly executed.

===Mutated XSS (mXSS) ===
Mutated XSS happens when the attacker injects something that is seemingly safe but is rewritten and modified by the browser while parsing the markup. This makes it extremely hard to detect or sanitize within the website&#x27;s application logic. An example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters on parameters to CSS font-family.

== Preventive measures ==
===Contextual output encoding/escaping of string input===

There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and URL (or percent) encoding. Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks in a fairly straightforward manner.

Performing HTML entity encoding only on the five XML significant characters is not always sufficient to prevent many forms of XSS attacks, security encoding libraries are usually easier to use.

Some web template systems understand the structure of the HTML they produce and automatically pick an appropriate encoder.

===Safely validating untrusted HTML input ===

Many operators of particular web applications (e.g. forums and webmail) allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, codice_2), output encoding (such as codice_3) will not suffice since the user input needs to be rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as &quot;very large&quot;, instead of &quot;&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large&quot;). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an HTML sanitization engine to ensure that it does not contain XSS code.

Many validations rely on parsing out (blacklisting) specific &quot;at risk&quot; HTML tags such as the iframe tag, link and the script tag.

There are several issues with this approach, for example sometimes seemingly harmless tags can be left out which when utilized correctly can still result in an XSS

Another popular method is to strip user input of &quot; and &#x27; however this can also be bypassed as the payload can be concealed with obfuscation.

===Cookie security===

Besides content filtering, other imperfect methods for cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One example is the use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.

====Http-only cookie====
Another mitigation present in Internet Explorer (since version 6), Firefox (since version 2.0.0.5), Safari (since version 4), Opera (since version 9.5) and Google Chrome, is an &quot;HttpOnly&quot; flag which allows a web server to set a cookie that is unavailable to client-side scripts. While beneficial, the feature can neither fully prevent cookie theft nor prevent attacks within the browser.

===Disabling scripts===

While Web 2.0 and Ajax developers require the use of JavaScript, some web applications are written to allow operation without the need for any client-side scripts. This allows users, if they choose, to disable scripting in their browsers before using the application. In this way, even potentially malicious client-side scripts could be inserted unescaped on a page, and users would not be susceptible to XSS attacks.

Some browsers or browser plugins can be configured to disable client-side scripts on a per-domain basis. This approach is of limited value if scripting is allowed by default, since it blocks bad sites only &quot;after&quot; the user knows that they are bad, which is too late. Functionality that blocks all scripting and external inclusions by default and then allows the user to enable it on a per-domain basis is more effective. This has been possible for a long time in Internet Explorer (since version 4) by setting up its so called &quot;Security Zones&quot;, and in Opera (since version 9) using its &quot;Site Specific Preferences&quot;. A solution for Firefox and other Gecko-based browsers is the open source NoScript add-on which, in addition to the ability to enable scripts on a per-domain basis, provides some XSS protection even when scripts are enabled.

The most significant problem with blocking all scripts on all websites by default is substantial reduction in functionality and responsiveness (client-side scripting can be much faster than server-side scripting because it does not need to connect to a remote server and the page or frame does not need to be reloaded). Another problem with script blocking is that many users do not understand it, and do not know how to properly secure their browsers. Yet another drawback is that many sites do not work without client-side scripting, forcing users to disable protection for that site and opening their systems to vulnerabilities. The Firefox NoScript extension enables users to allow scripts selectively from a given page while disallowing others on the same page. For example, scripts from example.com could be allowed, while scripts from advertisingagency.com that are attempting to run on the same page could be disallowed.

=== Selectively disabling scripts ===

====Content Security Policy====
Content Security Policy (CSP) allows HTML documents to opt in to disabling some scripts while leaving others enabled. The browser checks each script against a policy before deciding whether to run it. As long as the policy only allows trustworthy scripts and disallows dynamic code loading, the browser will not run programs from untrusted authors regardless of the HTML document&#x27;s structure.

Modern CSP policies allow using nonces to mark scripts in the HTML document as safe to run instead of keeping the policy entirely separate from the page content. As long as trusted nonces only appear on trustworthy scripts, the browser will not run programs from untrusted authors. Some large application providers report having successfully deployed nonce-based policies.

===Emerging defensive technologies===
Trusted types changes Web APIs to check that values have been trademarked as trusted.  As long as programs only trademark trustworthy values, an attacker who controls a JavaScript string value cannot cause XSS.  Trusted types are designed to be auditable by blue teams.

Another defense approach is to use automated tools that will remove XSS malicious code in web pages, these tools use static analysis and/or pattern matching methods to identify malicious codes potentially and secure them using methods like escaping.

===SameSite cookie parameter===
When a cookie is set with the codice_4 parameter, it is stripped from all cross-origin requests. When set with codice_5, it is stripped from all non-&quot;safe&quot; cross-origin requests (that is, requests other than GET, OPTIONS, and TRACE which have read-only semantics). The feature is implemented in Google Chrome since version 63 and Firefox since version 60.

<text>Mark Ellis (born 16 August 1960), known by his professional pseudonym Flood, is a British rock and synthpop record producer and audio engineer. Flood&#x27;s list of work includes projects with New Order, U2, Nine Inch Nails, Marc and the Mambas, Depeche Mode, Gary Numan, Sneaker Pimps, King, Ministry, The Charlatans, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Erasure, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, PJ Harvey, Foals, a-ha, Orbital, Sigur Rós, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Killers, White Lies, Pop Will Eat Itself, Warpaint, EOB, and Interpol. His co-production collaborations have included projects with Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Steve Lillywhite, and longtime collaborator Alan Moulder, with whom he co-founded the Assault &amp; Battery Studios complex. In 2006, his work with U2 led to his sharing of the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;.

== Early years ==
Mark Ellis was born in London. As a child Ellis attended St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School in Orpington, England. He began his music career as the vocalist for the band Seven Hertz. In 1978 he began his professional studio career as a runner at Morgan Studios in London and was the tape operator on Rick Wakeman&#x27;s album &quot;1984&quot;. Ellis was also a runner at Battery Studios in London and held apprenticeships at Marcus Studios and Trident Studios.

== Freelance and &quot;Some Bizzare Records&quot; ==

Flood moved up to house engineer before becoming a freelance engineer in 1981, the same year he worked as assistant engineer on New Order&#x27;s debut album &quot;Movement&quot;. The following year he engineered Ministry&#x27;s debut album &quot;With Sympathy&quot;. He became associated with Stevo&#x27;s &quot;Some Bizzare Records&quot; label, leading to him working with Cabaret Voltaire, Psychic TV, and Marc Almond&#x27;s side project, Marc and the Mambas among others.

==Mute Records==
Following his work with Some Bizzare Records, Flood began working with Mute Records as one of their preferred producers, heralding his first production project with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot; (1983–1984) and the follow-up album &quot;The Firstborn Is Dead&quot; (1984). His work at Mute was as a producer, co-producer, or engineer with each of the label&#x27;s major acts including Depeche Mode, Vince Clarke, and Erasure, whose debut album &quot;Wonderland&quot; (1986) and its follow-up &quot;The Circus&quot; (1987) he engineered.

==Mainstream commercial success==
Flood&#x27;s first mainstream commercial break came in 1987 when he engineered U2&#x27;s &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, alongside producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. In that same year, he gave up mixing U2&#x27;s album to produce Erasure&#x27;s &quot;The Circus&quot;, the duo&#x27;s second album and the first one to have great commercial success. Shortly thereafter, he co-produced Nine Inch Nails on debut &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, along with John Fryer, Adrian Sherwood, and Keith LeBlanc. He also worked with Depeche Mode on their 1990 album &quot;Violator&quot;. In 1991, he returned to work again with U2 on &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, along with Eno, Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite. The following year he returned to work with Depeche Mode to record the album &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; and co-produced three tracks of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; &quot;Broken&quot; EP.

In 1993, Flood shifted from engineering U2&#x27;s albums to being a producer along with Brian Eno and The Edge on &quot;Zooropa&quot;. In 1994, he worked again with Nine Inch Nails this time on &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;. In 1995, Flood co-produced The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; with longtime collaborator Alan Moulder, and PJ Harvey&#x27;s album &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;. Shortly thereafter, he assisted producer Nellee Hooper on Sneaker Pimps&#x27; &quot;Becoming X&quot;. He also collaborated with Dave Bessell, Gary Stout, and Ed Buller to create Node; an analogue synth heavy project that produced the album &quot;Node&quot;.

In 1996 Flood teamed with U2 once again to produce &quot;Pop&quot;, released the next year. The following year he assisted Billy Corgan and Brad Wood in producing The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Adore&quot; and co-produced PJ Harvey&#x27;s album &quot;Is This Desire?&quot;.

==2000 to 2005==
In 2000, he co-produced &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot; by The Smashing Pumpkins with Corgan. He co-produced Erasure&#x27;s &quot;Loveboat&quot; with Vince Clarke and Andy Bell of Erasure. The following year Flood worked again with Depeche Mode, remixing the single version of &quot;Freelove&quot;, and in 2002 he produced Richard Warren&#x27;s Echoboy album &quot;Giraffe&quot;. He also co-produced &quot;I To Sky&quot;, by JJ72.

In 2003, Flood re-worked Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; for his album &quot;Hybrid&quot;. The following year, Flood produced London-based The Duke Spirit&#x27;s debut album &quot;Cuts Across The Land&quot;. In the same year he co-produced U2&#x27;s &quot;How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb&quot;. In 2004 he produced Soulwax&#x27;s album &quot;Any Minute Now&quot;, and in mid-2005 he mixed a-ha&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Analogue&quot;, and produced &#x27;s debut album &quot;Ignoto&quot;. Later that year, Flood also mixed Placebo&#x27;s album &quot;Meds&quot;.

==2006 to 2013==
Flood co-produced The Killers&#x27; album &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; in 2006 with fellow English producer and engineer Alan Moulder. Later that year he remixed the debut single by Dark Room Notes, &quot;Love Like Nicotine&quot;. At the beginning of 2007, he co-produced PJ Harvey&#x27;s album &quot;White Chalk&quot; with John Parish and PJ Harvey. He also co-produced a couple of songs on the Goldfrapp album &quot;Seventh Tree&quot;, which was released in February 2008. In late 2007 and early 2008, he produced Sigur Rós&#x27;s &quot;Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust&quot; in Iceland.

Flood and Paul Hartnoll of Orbital co-produced the 2008 album by The Music, &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot;. He produced the 2009 album by The Hours, &quot;See the Light&quot;. He joined Steve Lillywhite again in 2008 to work with Thirty Seconds to Mars, on &quot;This Is War&quot;. And then worked with Editors on &quot;In This Light and on This Evening&quot;. He also collaborated with Nitzer Ebb again to finish up their first new release in over a decade, &quot;Industrial Complex&quot;. In 2010, he produced &quot;Belong&quot; by The Pains of Being Pure at Heart and &quot;Let England Shake&quot; by PJ Harvey.

In 2013, Flood worked again with Depeche Mode, being responsible for the mixing process of their album &quot;Delta Machine&quot; which was produced by Ben Hillier.

==Studios==
Flood had a studio in Kilburn called The Bedroom. He opened the Assault &amp; Battery studio complex with longtime recording partner Alan Moulder. In 2008, Miloco Studios opened Assault &amp; Battery 2, a tracking and mix studio in Willesden Green. Assault &amp; Battery 1 came under the Miloco umbrella in Summer 2009, and both Flood and Moulder remain involved with the studios, which have since been renamed Battery Studios.

==Production style==
Billy Corgan, who worked with Flood on three albums, said: 
==Pseudonym==
According to producer Mark Freegard, the pseudonym &quot;Flood&quot; was given to Ellis by producer Chris Tsangarides during Ellis&#x27; early days at Morgan Studios while The Cure was there recording. As a young studio runner Ellis was responsible for responding to numerous requests from the recording artists and staff for tea and bacon sandwiches. Ellis kept up with the numerous requests for tea while the other runner remained largely unavailable, leading to Tsangarides nicknaming them &quot;Flood&quot; and &quot;Drought,&quot; respectively.

<text>Bristol Rovers Football Club is a professional association football club in Bristol, England. The first team competes in League One, the third tier of the English football league system. The club&#x27;s official nickname is &quot;The Pirates&quot;, reflecting the maritime history of Bristol. The local nickname of the club is &quot;The Gas&quot;, derived from the gasworks next to their former home, Eastville Stadium. Since 1996, the club has played home matches at the Memorial Stadium in Horfield.

The club spent 89 years in the heart of North Bristol between 1897 and 1986 at the Eastville Stadium. Following a sale of the land they spent ten years at Twerton Park in Bath. The club&#x27;s nickname: &quot;The Gas&quot; originally began as a derogatory term used by fans of their main rivals, Bristol City, but was affectionately adopted by the club and its supporters. Cardiff City and Swindon Town are considered their second and third biggest rivals. Other rivalries include; Cheltenham Town, Exeter City, Forest Green Rovers, Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United and Yeovil Town. These rivalries are considered West Country Derbies and are often heated encounters. The women&#x27;s team play in the FA Women&#x27;s National League.

The club was founded in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. and entered the Bristol &amp; District League as Eastville Rovers in 1892. The club moved to the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1897, then changed divisions to the Southern League as Bristol Rovers in 1899. They won the Southern League in 1904–05 and were admitted to the Football League in 1920. They were placed in the Third Division South the following year and remained there until winning promotion as champions in 1952–53. They recorded their highest finishing positions in 1956 and 1959, a sixth-place finish in the Second Division, before suffering relegation in 1962. Promoted in second-place in 1973–74, they spent another seven seasons in the second tier until relegation in 1981. They won the Third Division title in 1989–90, though this time lasted just three seasons in the second tier and were relegated back into the fourth tier by 2001.

Rovers won the League Two play-off final in 2007, but relegations in 2011 and 2014 saw the club drop into the Conference Premier. They finished second in the Conference under the stewardship of Darrell Clarke and immediately regained their Football League status with victory in the 2015 play-off final. They followed up this success by securing promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2015–16 season. They were relegated from the third tier in 2020–21 but returned at the first attempt claiming the final automatic promotion spot to League One.

Rovers have won the Gloucestershire Cup 32 times, the Third Division South Cup in 1932, the Watney Cup in 1972, and have been Football League Trophy finalists two times.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The club was formed following a meeting at the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883. It was initially called Black Arabs F.C., after the Arabs rugby team and the predominantly black kits in which they played. This name only lasted for the 1883–84 season, and in a bid to draw more fans from the local area the club was renamed Eastville Rovers in 1884.

The club played only friendly games until the 1887–88 season, when it took part in the Gloucestershire Cup for the first time. In 1892, the club became a founder member of the Bristol and District League, which three years later was renamed the Western League. In 1897, Eastville Rovers joined the Birmingham and District League, and for two seasons played in both this league and the Western League. At the beginning of the 1897–98 season, the club turned professional and changed its name to Bristol Eastville Rovers, and, on 17 February 1899, the name was officially changed to Bristol Rovers. In 1899, Bristol Rovers joined the newly formed Southern League, where they remained until 1920, winning the league title along the way in 1905.

=== Into the Football League ===
For the 1920–21 season, the Southern League teams were moved into the new Division Three of the Football League, which became Division Three (South) the following season. They remained in this division for over 30 years, before winning the league, and promotion in the 1952–53 season.

The team has won promotion on six other occasions: in 1973–74 from the Third Division to the Second Division, again in 1989–90 as Division Three champions, in 2006–07 to the Football League One, in 2014–15 to League Two from the Conference Premier, in 2015–16 to League One and then in 2021-22 to League One from League Two. The club has been relegated seven times—in 1961–62, 1980–81, 1992–93, 2000–01, 2010–11, 2013–14 and most recently at the end of the 2020-21 season.

The highest position in the football ladder reached by Rovers at the end of season is sixth place in the second tier, which they achieved twice; once in 1955–56, and again in 1958–59. The closest they came to the top flight was in 1955–56, when they ended the season just four points below the promotion positions. The lowest league position achieved by the club is twenty-third out of twenty-four teams in the fourth tier, which has occurred twice. In the 2001–02 season, relegation from the Football League was narrowly avoided on two counts; firstly they ended just one league position above the relegation zone, and secondly the rules were changed the following season to increase the number of relegation places to two, meaning that if Rovers had finished in that position one year later they would have been relegated. This position was matched at the end of the 2013–14 season, which this time saw Rovers relegated to the Conference for the first time. They returned to the league at the end of their first Conference season, with a penalty shootout victory over Grimsby Town in the play-off final. In February 2016, it was announced that a 92% stake in the club had been bought by the Jordanian al-Qadi family, and that Wael al-Qadi, a member of the Jordan Football Association, would become the president. Since 2016, the club has been owned by Dwane Sports Ltd, with 92.6% of the shares, while Bristol Rovers Supporters Club owns the remaining 7.4%.

In May 2016, the club recorded a second consecutive promotion by finishing in the final automatic promotion position in League Two after a 92nd-minute goal secured victory over Dagenham and Redbridge and Accrington Stanley failed to win on the final day of the season. It marked the first time Rovers had reached the third tier of English Football since relegation in 2011. In June 2020, it was announced that president Wael al-Qadi had bought a controlling stake in Dwane Sports Ltd, after he bought the shares of other members of his family, while it was also announced that the club&#x27;s debt would be capitalised and a new training facility would begin construction at Hortham Lane, Almondsbury, which is close to the M5 motorway. Rovers have owned the site formerly known as &#x27;The Colony&#x27; and re-branded by the club &#x27;The Quarters&#x27; since 2017, and, in June 2020, the club announced that it would be ready for the beginning of the 2020–21 season.

On 3 August 2023, Kuwaiti businessman Hussain AlSaeed bought a controlling 55% share in Dwane Sports, the holding company for the football club, thus becoming chairman. As part of the takeover, all debt owed to the company was capitalised. On 22 November 2024, AlSaeed reached an agreement to purchase the remaining 45% of shares owned by both Wael and Samer al-Qadi, the acquisition to be completed over an eighteen-month period.

== Cup competitions ==

The only major cup competition won by Bristol Rovers is the 1972 Watney Cup, when they beat Sheffield United in the final. The club also won the Division Three (South) Cup in 1934–35, as well as winning or sharing the Gloucestershire Cup on 32 occasions. The team has never played in European competition; the closest Rovers came was when they missed out on reaching the international stage of the Anglo-Italian Cup in the 1992–93 season on a coin toss held over the phone with West Ham United.

In the FA Cup, Rovers have reached the quarter-final stage on three occasions. The first time was in 1950–51 when they faced Newcastle United at St James&#x27; Park in front of a crowd of 62,787, the record for the highest attendance at any Bristol Rovers match. The second time they reached the quarter final was in 1957–58, when they lost to Fulham, and the most recent appearance at this stage of the competition was during the 2007–08 season, when they faced West Bromwich Albion. They were the first Division Three team to win an FA Cup tie away to a Premier League side, when in 2002 they beat Derby County 3–1 at Pride Park Stadium.

They have twice reached the final of the Football League Trophy, in 1989–90 and 2006–07, but finished runners-up on both occasions. On the second occasion they did not allow a single goal against them in the competition &quot;en route&quot; to the final, but conceded the lead less than a minute after the final kicked off.

== Rivalries ==
Bristol Rovers&#x27;s main rivals are city neighbours Bristol City, with whom they contest the Bristol derby. An in-depth report by the Football Pools in 2008 deemed this rivalry 8th fiercest rivalry in English football. The most recent encounter between the clubs as of March 2024 took place on 4 September 2013, which saw Rovers beaten by City in a Football League Trophy tie at Ashton Gate Stadium by a 2–1 scoreline. Other rivals are Newport County and mainly teams from the West Country, such as Swindon Town, Cheltenham Town, Yeovil Town and Forest Green Rovers.

In the past, rivalries also emerged with Severnside rivals Cardiff City known as the Severnside derby. Rovers&#x27; most recent meeting against Cardiff was an EFL Cup defeat in August 2024. The last time Cardiff and Bristol Rovers were in the same league was in the 1999–2000 season in the Second Division.

The first time Rovers encountered Yeovil was a Football League Trophy match in October 2001, which Rovers won via a penalty shoot-out. The most recent encounter between the teams was in the EFL Trophy in October 2018, which Rovers won 2–0.

As of September 2024, Rovers last played Swindon Town in October 2022 in the EFL Trophy (a 3–0 win), Cheltenham Town in the 2023–24 League One season, a 3–1 victory, and Forest Green Rovers in the 2022–23 League One season (a 3–1 away victory).

Other clubs in the West country such as Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City have also been considered rivals despite being further away from Bristol (162 km for Plymouth and 104 km for Exeter). Bristol Rovers last played Plymouth in the 2022–23 League One season where Rovers lost 2–0 away from home and they last played Exeter at home in the 2023–24 season when they lost 1–0.

== Colours and badge ==

Bristol Rovers are known for their distinctive blue and white quartered shirts, which they have worn for most of their history. The current home kit consists of a light blue and white quartered shirt and white shorts, while the away kit is mainly grey with black accents. The away strip raises attention for blindness, and features braille on the body. During the 2008–09 season, a special third strip, which was black with a gold sash, and a reproduction of the original &quot;Black Arab&quot; shirt, was used for a single match to celebrate the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary.

The team began playing in black shirts with a yellow sash from their foundation in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. until 1885, by which time they were called Eastville Rovers. For the next fourteen years, until 1899, the team wore blue and white hooped shirts. These were replaced by black and white striped shirts until 1919.

When Rovers were admitted to The Football League in 1920 they wore white shirts with blue shorts. These remained the team colours until 1930, when the colours were reversed to blue shirts and white shorts for one season. The blue and white quarters were first worn in 1931, when they were introduced to try to make the players look larger and more intimidating. Rovers continued to wear the quarters for 31 years, until they were replaced by blue pinstripes on a white background.

Over the next ten years, Rovers went on to wear blue and white stripes, all blue, and blue shirts with white shorts before returning to the blue and white quarters in 1973, which have remained the colours ever since. During the 1996–97 season, Rovers wore an unpopular striped quartered design, prompting fans to refer to it as the Tesco bag shirts because of their similarity to the design used for the company&#x27;s carrier bags. The change in design prompted the Trump&quot;ton Times&quot; fanzine to change its name to &quot;Wot, No Quarters?&quot;

The black and gold shirts were also used as the away kit for the 2002–03 season, the club&#x27;s 120th anniversary.

In 2005, Rovers ran an April Fools&#x27; joke on their official website, stating that the team&#x27;s new away strip would be all pink. Although this was intended to be a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to a breast cancer charity. Although the pink shirts were never used in a competitive fixture, they were worn for a pre-season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006.

A pirate features on both the club badge and the badge of the supporters club, reflecting the club nickname of The Pirates. Previous club badges have featured a blue and white quartered design, based on the quartered design of the team&#x27;s jerseys.

=== Kit suppliers and sponsors ===
Rovers first used Bukta as an official kit supplier in 1977, and Great Mills as the first kit sponsor followed 1981. Rovers&#x27; longest running kit supplier is Errea who supplied the club kits for eleven years (2005–16). The club&#x27;s longest running kit sponsorship was from local company Cowlin Construction, who sponsored the club for 11 years before ending the deal in 2009. Following the end of the Cowlin deal, sponsors were chosen by raffle, via the 1883 Club. This process lasted nine seasons before the club announced Football INDEX as new sponsors for both home and away kits. In 2019, Utilita become the main shirt sponsors of both the home and away kits for the 2019-2020 season, and the deal was then extended in July 2020 to cover the 2020-2021 season, marking the first time a shirt sponsor had lasted for more than one season since the end of the Cowlin sponsorship in 2009.

=== History ===

Rovers play their home games at the Memorial Stadium in Horfield, a ground they formerly shared with Bristol Rugby. The team moved to The Mem, as it is known informally, at the beginning of the 1996–97 season, initially as tenants but purchased it two years later.

When Bristol Rovers were known as Black Arabs F.C. in 1883, they played their home games at Purdown, Stapleton. The following year they moved to Three Acres, the precise location of which is not known, but is believed to have been in the Ashley Down area of Bristol, where they remained for seven years. This was followed by brief stays at the Schoolmasters Cricket Ground, Durdham Down and Ridgeway.

For the majority of their history, Bristol Rovers have played their home games at the Eastville Stadium, where they remained for a period of 89 years from 1897 to 1986. Financial problems led to the team being forced to leave Eastville, now it is an IKEA Store. Bristol Rovers found a temporary home at Twerton Park, the home of Bath City. They stayed in Bath for 10 years, before returning to Bristol in 1996.

Rovers also played five home games at Ashton Gate Stadium, home of rivals Bristol City, following a fire which destroyed the South Stand of the Eastville Stadium on the night of the 16–17 August 1980. Rovers returned to Eastville in October 1980. During World War II, some friendly matches were played in Kingswood, and in their early history some games were played at Parson Street, Bedminster

In January 2007, planning permission was granted for a new 18,500 capacity all-seater stadium to be built on the site of the Memorial Stadium. The project was abandoned after a series of delays. In June 2011, the club announced its intention to relocate the club to a new 21,700 all-seater stadium on the University of the West of England&#x27;s Frenchay campus. The planned UWE Stadium was shelved in August 2017 due to disputes between the club and the university, and attention returned to redeveloping the Memorial Stadium.

In 2017, there was a crowd recording at the Memorial Stadium for &quot;Early Man&quot;, a 2018 Aardaman film.

In June 2020, the club began construction of a new training facility at a site on Hortham Lane, Almondsbury near the M5 motorway. The site is set to include two full size pitches, a goalkeeping area, a gym and a clubhouse building. Having owned the land since 2017, no work had previously been carried out before the club moved into the training ground for the start in October 2020.

On 6 April 2023, Conygar Investment Company exchanged contracts with the Wholesale Bristol Fruit Market for the land at St. Philips Marsh, with the football club seeing it was a &#x27;move in the right direction&#x27; with regards to a new stadium, having been involved in discussions for years prior. In October 2023, new owner Hussain AlSaeed confirmed that the club&#x27;s proposed move to the site was off and they would instead be redeveloping the Memorial Stadium.

== Supporter culture ==
The team traditionally draws the majority of its support from north and east Bristol and South Gloucestershire. Many towns and villages in the surrounding area are also home to significant pockets of Rovers supporters.

The nickname given to Bristol Rovers supporters is &quot;Gasheads&quot;. &quot;The Gas&quot; was originally coined as a derogatory term by the supporters of Bristol Rovers&#x27;s rivals Bristol City, and was in reference to the large gas works adjacent to the old Bristol Rovers stadium, in Eastville, Bristol which wafted the sometimes overpowering odour of town gas across the crowd. &quot;Gasheads&quot; was adopted as a name by a splinter group of Rovers supporters in the mid-1980s to early 1990s. The chant &quot;Proud to be a Gashead&quot; spread to regular fans, and a fanzine was produced called &quot;The Gashead&quot;.

The term &quot;Gasheads&quot; is now universally accepted within the English media and football fraternity as referring to Bristol Rovers supporters. After the club&#x27;s relegation to the Third Division in 2001, the club designated the squad number 12 to the Gasheads, to signify them as the club&#x27;s 12th Man in recognition of their loyal support.

The retired Conservative MP for Hayes and Harlington Terry Dicks was a Bristol Rovers fan. He mentioned the club in parliament (&quot;now struggling in the second division of the Endsleigh league&quot;) on 5 May 1994 when debating with Labour MP and Chelsea fan Tony Banks. Other notable fans are local musicians Roni Size and Geoff Barrow of Portishead and writer David Goldblatt. Former Bristol Rovers player and manager, Ian Holloway, who also managed QPR and Blackpool as well as featuring as a pundit, is still a big fan of the club.

Based on September 2014 statistics released by the Home Office, the Rovers fan base were named the Most Dangerous English Football fan base for the 2013–2014 season, with 57 arrests on the season, of which 35% were for &quot;violent disorder.&quot; Particularly dangerous was the scene on 3 May 2014 when the Rovers were assured relegation from the Football League for the first time.

The Rovers fans have good relations with Spanish club CE Sabadell FC, which initially began due to several Rovers fans noticing that the club had the same colours. In July 2016, the clubs played each other in a pre-season match in Spain.

One Bristol Rovers print fanzine is currently active and is entitled &quot;Last Saturday Night&quot;. There is also a fan-run podcast and blog called &quot;GasCast&quot;.

=== Club song ===
The song which is synonymous with Rovers is &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;, which was written by Lead Belly.

Opinions differ as to how this came about, but it is thought to have become popular in the 1950s when a version of the song was in the British charts—the line &quot;sometimes I have a great notion to jump in the river and drown&quot;—seemed to be particularly apt when Rovers lost, as the Bristol Frome flows alongside the old Eastville ground. It is believed that John Clapham is responsible for the song as he used to work at Eastville stadium for the greyhound racing and the last record he would play at the end of the night was &quot;Goodnight Irene&quot; also having a daughter called Irene, the record would then be left in the player and was played at the football. Another theory is that it was sung at a fireworks display at the Stadium the night before a home game against Plymouth Argyle in the 1950s. During the game the following day, Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of &quot;Goodnight Argyle&quot; from the Rovers supporters—the tune stuck and &quot;Irene&quot; became the club song.

Another popular Bristol Rovers song is &quot;Tote End Boys&quot;, which was written and sung by Ben Gunstone. The name derives from the section of Gasheads who stood in the Tote End terrace at Rovers&#x27; old home, Eastville Stadium.

== Youth Academy ==
The Bristol Rovers Academy currently operates at The City Academy Bristol and Sir Bernard Lovell School. Current first-team squad members Kofi Shaw and Jed Ward graduated from the Academy to earn professional contracts. In May 2021, U16s player Kyrie Pierre signed for Aston Villa for an undisclosed six-figure fee, a record fee received by the Academy for a player.

One former member of the academy is Scott Sinclair, who was signed by Chelsea in 2005 for £200,000, with further payments to the club possible, depending on performance. 

Other former Academy players currently contracted to teams in the Premier League or English Football League include Ryan Broom (Fleetwood Town), Ollie Clarke (Swindon Town), Ellis Harrison (Milton Keynes Dons), Alfie Kilgour (Mansfield Town), Tom Lockyer (Luton Town), Matt Macey (Colchester United) and Donovan Wilson (Grimsby Town).

== Women&#x27;s team ==

The club formerly had a women&#x27;s team, set up in 1998, as Bristol Rovers W.F.C., following a merger with Cable-Tel L.F.C.. This merger came about as Bristol Rovers only had girls&#x27; teams up to the under-16 age group level, so when girls reached the age of 16 they were forced to leave the club. The merger with Cable-Tel meant that Bristol Rovers had a senior squad. The club&#x27;s name was changed to Bristol Academy W.F.C. in 2005, to reflect the increased investment from the Bristol Academy of Sport. In 2016, Bristol Academy were re-branded as Bristol City following a sponsorship arrangement with Rovers&#x27; local rivals.

In 2019, it was announced that Rovers were to reform their women&#x27;s team. They began fielding two teams in the Gloucestershire County Women&#x27;s Football League in the 2019–20 season. The relaunched Bristol Rovers Women&#x27;s FC was founded by Matthew Davies and Nathan Hallett-Young. As of 2019, the first team played in Division One, with a development team playing in Division Two.

<doc id="241162" wikidata="Q170166" url="?curid=241162" title="Martin Marietta X-24">
<text>The Martin Marietta X-24 is an American experimental aircraft developed from a joint United States Air Force-NASA program named PILOT (1963–1975). It was designed and built to test lifting body concepts, experimenting with the concept of unpowered reentry and landing, later used by the Space Shuttle. Originally built as the X-24A, the aircraft was later rebuilt as the X-24B.

The X-24 was drop launched from a modified B-52 Stratofortress at high altitudes before igniting its rocket engine; after expending its rocket fuel, the pilot would glide the X-24 to an unpowered landing.

==Design and development==
The X-24 was one of a group of lifting bodies flown by the NASA Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) in a joint program with the U.S. Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base in California from 1963 to 1975. The lifting bodies were used to demonstrate the ability of pilots to maneuver and safely land wingless vehicles designed to fly back to Earth from space and be landed like an airplane at a predetermined site.

Lifting bodies’ aerodynamic lift, essential to flight in the atmosphere, was obtained from their shape. The addition of fins and control surfaces allowed the pilots to stabilize and control the vehicles and regulate their flight paths.

The X-24 (Model SV-5P) was built by Martin Marietta and flown from Edwards AFB, California. The X-24A was the fourth lifting body design to fly; it followed the NASA M2-F1 in 1964, the Northrop HL-10 in (1966), the Northrop M2-F2 in 1966 and preceded the Northrop M2-F3 (1970).

The X-24A was a fat, short teardrop shape with vertical fins for control. It made its first, unpowered, glide flight on April 17, 1969 with Air Force Maj. Jerauld R. Gentry at the controls. Gentry also piloted its first powered flight on March 19, 1970. The craft was taken to around 45,000 feet (13.7 km) by a modified B-52 and then drop launched, then either glided down or used its rocket engine to ascend to higher altitudes before gliding down. The X-24A was flown 28 times at speeds up to 1,036 mph (1,667 km/h) and altitudes up to 71,400 feet (21.8 km).

===X-24B===
The X-24B&#x27;s design evolved from a family of potential reentry shapes, each with higher lift-to-drag ratios, proposed by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. To reduce the costs of constructing a research vehicle, the Air Force returned the X-24A to the Martin Marietta Corporation (as Martin Aircraft Company became after a merger) for modifications that converted its bulbous shape into one resembling a &quot;flying flatiron&quot;—rounded top, flat bottom, and a double delta planform that ended in a pointed nose.

John Manke was the first to fly the X-24B, a glide flight on 1 August 1973. He was also the pilot on the first powered mission 15 November 1973.

===X-24C===
There were a variety of &quot;X-24C&quot; proposals floated between 1972 and 1978. Perhaps the most notable was a Lockheed Skunk Works design, the L-301, which was to use scramjets to reach a top speed of Mach 8.

===SV-5J===

After learning about a remark by Chuck Yeager that he would like to have some jet-powered lifting bodies for training purposes, Martin designed and built, on their own initiative, two examples of the SV-5J.

The SV-5J was a jet-powered version of the rocket-powered X-24A. The SV-5J had identical dimensions to the X-24A, but was powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney J60-PW-1 jet engine of 1360 kgf, in place of the X-24A&#x27;s Reaction Motors XLR-11-RM-13 rocket engine. Martin also manufactured a full-scale, unflyable, mock-up of the SV-5J. (Confusion over number built may be due to the mock-up being included in the production list.)

Martin were unable to convince Milt Thompson to fly the SV-5J, even after offering a $20,000 bonus. Both examples remained unflown.

As the original X-24A was converted to X-24B, one of the SV-5Js eventually was converted to represent the X-24A, for display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, beside the original X-24B.

==Operational history==
The X-24A was flown 28 times in the program that, like the HL-10, validated the concept that a Space Shuttle vehicle could be landed unpowered. The fastest speed achieved by the X-24A was 1,036 miles per hour (1667 km/h or Mach 1.6). Its maximum altitude was 71,400 feet (21.8 km). It was powered by an XLR-11 rocket engine with a maximum theoretical vacuum thrust of 8,480 pounds force (37.7 kN).

The X-24A was modified into the more stable X-24B with an entirely different shape in 1972. The bulbous shape of the X-24A was converted into a &quot;flying flatiron&quot; shape with a rounded top, flat bottom, and double delta planform that ended in a pointed nose. It was the basis for the Martin SV-5J. The X-24A shape was later borrowed for the X-38 Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) technology demonstrator for the International Space Station.

X-24A pilots
* Jerauld R. Gentry – 13 flights
* John A. Manke – 12 flights
* Cecil W. Powell – 3 flights

===X-24B===
The X-24B demonstrated that accurate unpowered reentry vehicle landings were operationally feasible. Top speed achieved by the X-24B was 1,164 mph (1873 km/h) and the highest altitude it reached was 74,130 feet (22.59 km). The pilot on the last powered flight of the X-24B was Bill Dana, who also flew the last X-15 flight about seven years earlier.

Among the final flights with the X-24B were two precise landings on the main concrete runway at Edwards. These missions were flown by Manke and Air Force Maj. Mike Love, and represented the final milestone in a program that helped write the flight plan for the Space Shuttle program.

The X-24B was the last aircraft to fly in Dryden&#x27;s Lifting Body program. The X-24B was flown 36 times.

The X-24B is on public display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.

<text>Kukës (; ) is a city in Albania. The city is the capital of the surrounding municipality of Kukës and county of Kukës, one of 12 constituent counties of the republic. It spans and had a total population of 15,643 people as of 2023. 

Geologically, the surrounding area is dominated by mountainous and high terrain. The city sprawls across the Luma Plain within the Albanian Alps between the banks of Lake Fierza and the hills of the northernmost Korab Mountains and westernmost Sharr Mountains. At the confluence of the Black and White Drin, the Drin River originates close to the city&#x27;s territory.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Kukës traces its history back over a thousand years. The region that nowadays corresponds to the city territory was inhabited by several ancient Illyrian tribes (most predominantly Dardani tribe), as most of Albania. Numerous tombs from the Illyrians have been identified at Këneta and Kolsh nearby the city. The city was part of Kingdom of Dardania during antiquity. The residential estate served as a stopping point on a branch road leading to the Via Egnatia, which connected Durrës on the Adriatic Sea in the west with Constantinople on the Marmara Sea in the east. 

Illyrian tombs were found at Këneta and Kolsh nearby Kukës. It was a small Roman settlement, a stopping point on a branch road leading to the Via Egnatia, and a minor Ottoman market centre and trading post on the road to southern Kosovo. It was there (Qafa e Kolosjanit) where Albanian resistance stood up against retreating Serbian army in 1912.
=== Modern development ===

The old Kukës was located at the confluence of the White Drin and Black Drin. In 1976 the town was submerged beneath the Fierza Reservoir, which is held back by a dam.
The new town (&quot;Kukësi i Ri&quot; - &quot;New Kukës&quot;) was built in the 1970s in the plateau nearby which is 320m over the sea level. Kukësi i Ri is surrounded by the artificial lake of Fierza and it looks like a peninsula from the above.
It is linked with the other parts of the country by three bridges. On the east it faces the snow-covered mountain of Gjallica, 2468 m above sea level.
In modern times and due to the close proximity to Kosovo, the city achieved worldwide recognition during the Kosovo War as thousands of Kosovo-Albanian refugees crossed the border and found security in the city. Kukës attracted international attention during the Kosovo War when 450,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees crossed the frontier and were housed in camps in and around Kukës.

=== Contemporary ===
The city was nominated for the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize in regard to hospitality and for embracing thousands of refugees during the Kosovo War. It was the first time a town was nominated for the prize. In 2017, the city applied for the 2018 European Green Capital Award to become Europe&#x27;s Green Capital.
There is a mosque and a closed alpine-style hotel, part of an attempt to establish a tourist industry there. The OSCE maintained a villa there.

== Environment ==
Kukës is situated in the northeast of the country. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 5° N, and longitudes 20° and 25° E. The city lies on the Luma Plain and the southern shores of Lake Fierza. It lies approximately in the southeast of the former location of the city, which was relocated as part of a hydroelectric scheme.

=== Climate ===
Like all East Albanians who are in the plain the zone is humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), similar to the north of Italy, due to its interior location but near the Mediterranean. Despite its southern location, its distance to the east compensates for this difference. The city experiences mostly continental climate. This means that the winters are cold and snowy and the summers are predominantly hot. The city&#x27;s temperature varies a large deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, hot summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in September and October and very cold winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The mean monthly temperature ranges between in winter and in summer. The mean annual precipitation ranges between and depending on longitude and latitude.

==Politics==
The Kukës municipality was formed in 1923 by the merger of the former municipalities Arrën, Bicaj, Bushtricë, Grykë-Çajë, Kalis, Kolsh, Kukës, Malzi, Shishtavec, Shtiqën, Surroj, Tërthore, Topojan, Ujëmisht and Zapod, that became municipal units. The municipality spans and had a total population of 36,125 people as of 2023.

== Economy == 
After the fall of communism, due to the newly implemented freedom of movement among all Albanians, a significant number of Kukës’ population relocated internally or emigrated abroad for better economic opportunities.

The region is well known for their developed agriculture. Kukës has a carpet factory whose products are for domestic and trade use. There is also a copper processing factory as the raw material.

Kukës is a good centre for fishing and walking in the surrounding mountains.

The A1 highway passes through Kukës.

<doc id="241167" wikidata="Q370560" url="?curid=241167" title="David Crosby">
<text>David Van Cortlandt Crosby (August 14, 1941 – January 18, 2023) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He first found fame as a member of the Byrds, with whom he helped pioneer the genres of folk rock and psychedelia in the mid-1960s, and later as part of the supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, who helped popularize the California sound of the 1970s. In addition to his music, Crosby was known for his outspoken personality, politics, and personal troubles; he was sometimes depicted as emblematic of the counterculture of the 1960s.

After a short time performing in the folk music scene, Crosby co-founded the Byrds in 1964. They scored their first number-one hit in 1965 with a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;. Crosby appeared on the Byrds&#x27; first five albums and the original lineup&#x27;s 1973 reunion album. In 1968, he formed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (CSN) with Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. After the release of their debut album, CSN won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 1969. The group later occasionally included Neil Young. The core trio of CSN remained active from 1976 until 2016, and the duo of Crosby &amp; Nash also recorded three gold albums in the 1970s. Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY) reunions were held in each decade from the 1970s through the 2000s.

Crosby released eight solo albums, albeit sporadically, over the course of his career. His solo debut was 1971&#x27;s &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;. The last five of his solo albums, beginning with &quot;Croz&quot; (2014), came in the last decade of his life. Additionally, he formed a jazz-influenced trio with his son James Raymond and guitarist Jeff Pevar in CPR. He also appeared frequently on recordings by other artists, including Joni Mitchell, Jefferson Airplane, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, Elton John and David Gilmour.

Crosby&#x27;s combined work with the Byrds and CSNY has sold over 35 million albums. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: once for his work in the Byrds and again for his work with CSN. Five albums to which he contributed are included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, three with the Byrds and two with CSN(Y).

He was also an occasional actor, appearing as a member of Captain Hook&#x27;s pirate crew in &quot;Hook&quot; (1991).

== Early years ==
David Van Cortlandt Crosby was born on August 14, 1941, in Los Angeles, California, the second son of Academy Award-winning cinematographer Floyd Crosby, who formerly worked on Wall Street, and Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead, a salesperson at Macy&#x27;s department store. His father was a relative of the Van Rensselaer family, and his mother—granddaughter of Bishop of Pittsburgh Cortlandt Whitehead—descended from the prominent Van Cortlandt family; they &quot;regularly inhabited the New York society pages before their wedding&quot;.

Crosby’s older brother was musician Ethan Crosby. His brother inspired his early love of jazz, particularly John Coltrane and Miles Davis; the latter would later recommend that Columbia Records sign the Byrds, and then cover the Crosby composition &quot;Guinnevere.&quot; Their parents divorced in 1960, and his father then married Betty Cormack Andrews.

Growing up in California, he attended several schools, including the University Elementary School in Los Angeles, the Crane Country Day School in Montecito, and Laguna Blanca School in Santa Barbara for the rest of his elementary school and junior high years. At Crane, he starred in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and other musicals but he flunked out. Crosby finished high school via correspondence courses from the Cate School in Carpinteria. He briefly attended Carpinteria Union High School in 1958. Ethan (&#x27;Chip&#x27;) had been at CUHS before David. At CUHS David was given the lead in the Junior Class Play.

== Musical career ==

=== The Byrds ===


Crosby briefly studied drama at Santa Barbara City College before dropping out to pursue a career in music. He performed with singer Terry Callier in Chicago and Greenwich Village, but the duo failed to obtain a recording contract. He also performed with Les Baxter&#x27;s Balladeers in 1964/1965 and published four singles in 1965, including a cover of the Beatles&#x27;s song, &quot;Michelle&quot;. With the help of producer Jim Dickson, Crosby recorded his first solo session in 1963, with a cover of a song by Ray Charles. Miriam Makeba was on tour and in Chicago at the time with her band, which included Jim McGuinn, a multi-instrumentalist who later dropped his first name and began to go by his middle name, Roger McGuinn. Callier introduced Crosby to McGuinn and Gene Clark, who were then performing by the name the Jet Set. Crosby joined them, and they were augmented by drummer Michael Clarke, at which point Crosby attempted, unsuccessfully, to play bass. Late in 1964, Chris Hillman joined the band as bassist, and Crosby relieved Gene Clark of rhythm guitar duties.

Through connections that Jim Dickson (The Byrds&#x27; manager) had with Bob Dylan&#x27;s music publisher, the band obtained a demo acetate disc of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; and recorded a version of the song, featuring McGuinn&#x27;s twelve-string guitar as well as McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark&#x27;s vocal harmonies. The song was a massive hit, reaching No. 1 in the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom during 1965. While McGuinn originated the Byrds&#x27; trademark 12-string guitar sound, Crosby was responsible for the soaring harmonies and often unusual phrasing of their songs. While he did not sing lead vocals on either of the first two albums, he sang lead on the bridge in their second single &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;.

In 1966, Clark, who then was the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, left the group because of stress and this placed all the group&#x27;s songwriting responsibilities in the hands of McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman. Crosby took the opportunity to hone his craft and soon became a relatively prolific songwriter, collaborating with McGuinn on the up-tempo &quot;I See You&quot; (covered by Yes on their 1969 debut) and penning the ruminative &quot;What&#x27;s Happening&quot;. His early Byrds efforts also included the 1966 hit &quot;Eight Miles High&quot; (to which he contributed one line, according to Clark, while Clark and McGuinn wrote the rest), and its flip side &quot;Why&quot;, co-written with McGuinn.

Because Crosby felt responsible for and was widely credited with popularizing the song &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, he persuaded the other members of the Byrds to record it on &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot;. By &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, the Byrds&#x27; 1967 album, Crosby began to find his trademark style on songs such as &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot; (co-written with McGuinn), &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;, and &quot;It Happens Each Day&quot;; however, the latter song was omitted from the final album and ultimately restored as a bonus track on the 1996 remastered edition. The album also contained a rerecording of &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Been Burned&quot;, a jazzy torch song from Crosby&#x27;s pre-Byrds repertoire that was initially demoed in 1963.

Friction between Crosby and the other Byrds came to a head in early to mid-1967. Tensions were high after the Monterey International Pop Festival in June when Crosby&#x27;s onstage political diatribes and support of various John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories between songs outraged McGuinn. He further annoyed his bandmates when, at the invitation of Stephen Stills, he sat in with Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s set the following night, after Young had quit the band and was replaced by guitarist Doug Hastings. The internal conflict boiled over during the initial recording sessions for &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; (1968) that summer, where differences over song selections led to intra-band arguments. In particular, Crosby was adamant that the band should record only original material despite the recent commercial failure of &quot;Lady Friend&quot;, a Crosby-penned single that stalled at No.82 on the American charts following its release. McGuinn and Hillman dismissed Crosby in October after he refused to countenance the recording of a cover of Goffin and King&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; Back&quot;. While Crosby contributed to three compositions and five recordings on the final album, his controversial ménage à trois ode &quot;Triad&quot; was omitted. Jefferson Airplane released a Grace Slick-sung cover on &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; (1968), and three years later, Crosby released a solo acoustic version on Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&#x27;s double live album &quot;4 Way Street&quot; (1971). The Byrds&#x27; version appeared decades later on the 1987 &quot;Never Before&quot; release and later on the 1997 re-release of &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;.

In 1973, Crosby reunited with the original Byrds for the album &quot;Byrds&quot;, with Crosby acting as the album&#x27;s producer. The album charted well (at No. 20, their best album showing since their second album) but was generally not perceived to be a critical success. It marked the final artistic collaboration of the original band.

=== Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young ===

Around the time of Crosby&#x27;s departure from the Byrds in 1968, he met Stephen Stills at Laurel Canyon in California through Cass Elliot (of the Mamas &amp; the Papas), and the two started meeting informally and jamming together. They were soon joined by Graham Nash, who would leave his commercially successful group the Hollies to play with Crosby and Stills. Their appearance at the Woodstock Music and Art Fair in August 1969 constituted only their second live performance.

Their first album, &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot; (1969), was an immediate hit, spawning two Top 40 hit singles and receiving key airplay on the new FM radio format, in its early days populated by unfettered disc jockeys who then had the option of playing entire albums at once.

The songs Crosby wrote while in CSN include &quot;Guinnevere&quot;, &quot;Almost Cut My Hair&quot;, &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, and &quot;Delta&quot;. He also co-wrote &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; with Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane and Stills.

In 1969, Neil Young joined the group, and with him, they recorded the album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, which peaked at No.1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the ARIA Charts. On September 30, 1969, Crosby&#x27;s longtime girlfriend Christine Hinton was killed in a car accident only days after Hinton, Crosby, and Debbie Donovan moved from Los Angeles to the San Francisco Bay Area. Crosby was devastated, and he began abusing drugs more severely than he had before. Nevertheless, he still managed to contribute &quot;Almost Cut My Hair&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track. After the release of the double live album &quot;4 Way Street&quot;, the group went on a four-year hiatus to focus on their respective solo careers.

In December 1969, Crosby appeared with CSNY at the Altamont Free Concert, increasing his visibility after also having performed at the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock. At the beginning of 1970, he briefly joined with Jerry Garcia, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart from Grateful Dead, billed as &quot;David and the Dorks&quot;, and making a live recording at The Matrix on December 15, 1970. 

CSNY reunited in the summer of 1973 for unsuccessful recording sessions in Maui and Los Angeles. Despite lingering acrimony, they reconvened at a Stills concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in October. This served as a prelude to their highly successful stadium tour in the summer of 1974. Following the tour, the foursome attempted once again to record a new album, provisionally entitled &quot;Human Highway&quot;. The recording sessions, which took place at the Record Plant in Sausalito, were very unpleasant, marked by constant bickering. The acrimonious atmosphere was too much for Neil Young, who deserted the sessions and the album was never completed.

In rehearsals for the 1974 tour, CSNY recorded a then-unreleased Crosby song, &quot;Little Blind Fish&quot;. A different version of the song would appear on the second CPR album more than two decades later. The 1974 tour was also affected by bickering, though they managed to finish it without interruption. A greatest hits compilation entitled &quot;So Far&quot; was released in 1974 to capitalize on the foursome&#x27;s reunion tour.

In 1976, as separate duos, Crosby &amp; Nash and Stills &amp; Young were both working on respective albums and contemplated retooling their work to produce a CSNY album. This attempt ended bitterly as Stills and Young deleted Crosby and Nash&#x27;s vocals from their album &quot;Long May You Run&quot;.

CSNY did not perform together again as a foursome until Live Aid in Philadelphia in 1985, and then performed only sporadically in the 1980s and 1990s (mainly at the annual Bridge School Benefit organized by Young&#x27;s wife Pegi). Without Young, however, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash performed much more consistently after its reformation in 1977. The trio toured in support of their 1977 and 1982 albums &quot;CSN&quot; and &quot;Daylight Again&quot; and then, starting in the late 1980s, toured regularly year after year. The group continued to perform live, and since 1982 released four albums of new material: &quot;American Dream&quot; (1988, with Young), &quot;Live It Up&quot; (1990), &quot;After the Storm&quot; (1994), and &quot;Looking Forward&quot; (1999, with Young). In addition, Crosby &amp; Nash released the self-titled album &quot;Crosby &amp; Nash&quot; in 2004.

Full-scale CSNY tours took place in 2000, 2002, and 2006.

Crosby, Stills, and Nash appeared together on a 2008 episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, with Colbert filling in for Young in the fourth harmony part on &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;.

Following a November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future, Nash announced on March 6, 2016, that Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash would never perform again because of his poor relationship with Crosby.

=== 1971–2022: Solo career and Crosby &amp; Nash ===

In 1971, Crosby released his first solo album, &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;, featuring contributions by Nash, Young, Joni Mitchell, and members of Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Panned on release by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, it has been reappraised amid the emergence of the freak folk and New Weird America movements and remains in print. In a 2010 list of the Best Albums published by the Vatican City newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; came in second to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;.

As a duo, Crosby &amp; Nash (C&amp;N) released four studio albums and two live albums, including &quot;Another Stoney Evening&quot;, which features the duo in a 1971 acoustic performance with no supporting band. Crosby songs recorded by C&amp;N in the 1970s include &quot;Whole Cloth&quot;, &quot;Where Will I Be?&quot;, &quot;Page 43&quot;, &quot;Games&quot;, &quot;The Wall Song&quot;, &quot;Carry Me&quot;, &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot; (co-written with Nash), &quot;Low Down Payment&quot;, &quot;Homeward Through the Haze&quot;, &quot;Time After Time&quot;, &quot;Dancer&quot;, &quot;Taken at All&quot; (also co-written with Nash), and &quot;Foolish Man&quot;. During the mid-1970s, Crosby and Nash enjoyed careers as session musicians, contributing harmonies and background vocals to albums by Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne (whom Crosby had initially championed as an emerging songwriter), Dave Mason, Rick Roberts, James Taylor (most notably &quot;Lighthouse&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot;), Art Garfunkel, Carole King, Elton John, JD Souther, and Gary Wright.

Renewing his ties to the San Francisco milieu that had abetted so well on his solo album, Crosby sang backup vocals on several Paul Kantner and Grace Slick albums from 1971 through 1974 and the Hot Tuna album &quot;Burgers&quot; in 1972. He also participated in composer Ned Lagin&#x27;s proto-ambient project &quot;Seastones&quot; along with members of the Grateful Dead and of Jefferson Starship.

Crosby worked with Phil Collins occasionally from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. He sang backup to Collins in &quot;That&#x27;s Just the Way It Is&quot; and &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, and, on his own 1993 song, &quot;Hero&quot;, from his album &quot;Thousand Roads&quot;, Collins sang backup. In 1992, Crosby sang backup on the album &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; with the Indigo Girls on the tracks &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Let it Be Me&quot;. In 1999, he appeared on &quot;Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons&quot;, singing a duet of the title track with Lucinda Williams.

In 2006, Crosby and Nash worked with David Gilmour as backing vocalists on the latter&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;On an Island&quot;. The album was released in March 2006 and reached No. 1 on the UK charts. They also performed live with Gilmour in his concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in May 2006 and toured together in the United States, as can be seen on Gilmour&#x27;s 2007 DVD &quot;Remember That Night&quot;. They also sang backup on the title track of John Mayer&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Born and Raised&quot;.

In January 2014, Crosby released his first solo album in 20 years, &quot;Croz&quot;, recorded in close collaboration with his son James Raymond (of the CPR band) at the latter&#x27;s home studio.

On July 14, 2016, Crosby announced a new solo album named &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, which was released on October 21, 2016, and shared a new track from it titled &quot;Things We Do for Love&quot;. The album was produced by Michael League of the big band Snarky Puppy, whom he met on Twitter, and also featured contributions by future collaborators Becca Stevens and Michelle Willis. On August 26, 2016, Crosby announced a U.S. tour, an 18-date trek to launch on November 18, 2016, in Atlanta, Georgia, and to conclude on December 16, 2016, in Ithaca, New York. He also spoke out against Donald Trump during the latter&#x27;s presidential campaign.

In September 2017, Crosby announced a solo album (his third one of original material in four years and his sixth in total) entitled &quot;Sky Trails&quot;, again with Raymond, to be released on September 29, 2017, on BMG.

In April 2018, Crosby appeared on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Live from Here&quot;, playing duets with host Chris Thile.

On October 26, 2018, Crosby released &quot;Here If You Listen&quot; on BMG, his first collaborative album with League, Stevens, and Willis, all members of the &quot;Lighthouse&quot; band. The band also toured from November to December of that same year.

Crosby was the subject of the documentary film &quot;David Crosby: Remember My Name&quot; which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival. Crosby mentioned that Cameron Crowe, who asked the interview questions for the film, knew &quot;where the bones are buried.&quot; Following the premiere of the film, Crosby toured as David Crosby &amp; Friends from May to September 2019.

In July 2021, Crosby released what would become his final studio album, &quot;For Free&quot;. This was followed by the release of the 50th-anniversary expanded version of &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; on October 15. It contains remastered songs as well as demos from the original recording sessions. During promotion for the rerelease, Crosby said that his second collaborative album with League, Stevens, and Willis was in the works. The result, Crosby&#x27;s final release, was a live album recorded during the band&#x27;s tour, &quot;Live at the Capitol Theatre,&quot; released October 4, 2022.

=== 1996–2004: CPR ===
In 1996, Crosby formed CPR or Crosby, Pevar &amp; Raymond with session guitarist Jeff Pevar, and pianist James Raymond, Crosby&#x27;s son. The group released two studio albums and two live albums before disbanding in 2004.

The first song that Crosby and Raymond co-wrote, &quot;Morrison&quot;, was performed live for the first time in January 1997. The song recalled Crosby&#x27;s feelings about the portrayal of Jim Morrison in the movie &quot;The Doors&quot;. The success of the 1997 tour spawned a record project, &quot;Live at Cuesta College&quot;, released in March 1998. There is a second CPR studio record, &quot;Just Like Gravity&quot;, and another live recording, &quot;Live at the Wiltern&quot;, recorded at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, which also features Phil Collins and Graham Nash.

In 2012 David Crosby worked in Italy with saxophonist Enzo Avitabile

After the group split, Raymond continued to perform with Crosby as part of the touring bands for C&amp;N and CSN, as well as on solo Crosby projects, including 2014&#x27;s &quot;Croz&quot; and the subsequent tour. Pevar has toured with many artists over his productive career, including CSN, Ray Charles, Rickie Lee Jones, and Marc Cohn. Pevar has a solo record, &quot;From the Core&quot;, which was improvised and recorded in the Oregon Caves and features the vocalist from Yes, Jon Anderson.

Crosby reunited with the other two members of CPR in 2018 as David Crosby &amp; Friends, performing a series of shows in support of Crosby&#x27;s new album &quot;Skytrails&quot;. During the global pandemic, Crosby also hosted a podcast for the Osiris music network with his friend, journalist Steve Silberman.
== Personal life and death ==
=== Family ===
Crosby and Celia Crawford Ferguson had a son, James Raymond, in 1962. James was placed for adoption and later reunited with Crosby as an adult. Beginning in 1997, Raymond performed with Crosby on stage and in the studio, as a member of CPR, and as part of the touring bands Crosby &amp; Nash and Crosby, plus Stills &amp; Nash. Crosby had three other children: daughter Erika, with Jackie Guthrie, daughter Donovan Crosby, with former girlfriend Debbie Donovan, and son Django Crosby, conceived with wife Jan Dance after extensive fertility treatments while Crosby&#x27;s liver was failing.

Crosby, then 45, married Jan Dance, then 35, in May 1987 at the Hollywood Church of Religious Science in Los Angeles. His bandmate Stephen Stills gave away the bride.

Crosby&#x27;s brother Ethan, who taught him to play guitar and started his musical career with him, died by suicide in late 1997 or early 1998; the date is unknown because Ethan left a note not to search for his body but to let him return to the earth. His body was found months later in May 1998.

In January 2000, Melissa Etheridge announced that Crosby was the biological father of two children with her partner Julie Cypher by means of artificial insemination. On May 13, 2020, Etheridge announced on her Twitter account that her and Cypher&#x27;s son Beckett had died of causes related to opioid addiction at the age of 21.

=== Cannabis brand ===
Crosby, in partnership with longtime friend and entrepreneur Steven Sponder, developed a craft cannabis brand called &quot;MIGHTY CROZ&quot;. Crosby, a 50-plus-year cannabis advocate and connoisseur, credited cannabis with contributing to his creative process of songwriting stating, &quot;All those hit songs, every one of them, I wrote them all on cannabis.&quot; Crosby also credited cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD) with alleviating his chronic shoulder pain, allowing him to continue touring and making new music well into his seventies. Crosby and Sponder intended to work with licensed cultivators throughout the U.S. and beyond and to also extend the brand to include CBD and hemp products. In 2018, Crosby was invited to join the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advisory board.

=== Sailing ===
Having had a transformative sailing experience when he was eleven, in 1967 Crosby purchased a John Alden–designed schooner named &quot;Mayan&quot; with his Byrds settlement. On Twitter in 2019, Crosby said that the late Peter Tork of the Monkees loaned him the money to buy the &quot;Mayan&quot;. In the decades before he sold the boat in 2014, Crosby sailed it thousands of miles in the Pacific and Caribbean. He credited the &quot;Mayan&quot; as being a songwriting muse; he wrote some of his best-known songs aboard the boat, including &quot;Wooden Ships,&quot; &quot;The Lee Shore,&quot; &quot;Page 43,&quot; and &quot;Carry Me.&quot;

=== Politics ===

Crosby was politically active throughout his professional career. He publicly questioned the report of the Warren Commission covering the assassination of John F. Kennedy onstage during the Byrds&#x27;s appearance at the Monterey Festival in 1967, to the anger of his bandmates. He identified as a pacifist and was a well-known opponent of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War, although he defended the right to own guns.

Crosby strongly criticized the presidency of Donald Trump, declaring him to be &quot;a dangerous guy who&#x27;s got a big ego&quot;. For the 2020 presidential election, he said in an interview that Mayor Pete Buttigieg was his favorite candidate for president and was smarter than all the others combined; however, he eventually voted for Bernie Sanders.

Although Crosby was against Joe Biden&#x27;s candidacy during the 2020 presidential primaries, he voiced a more positive assessment following Biden&#x27;s general election victory in November. Describing him as a &quot;decent guy&quot;, Crosby noted that the personal tragedies Biden experienced with the deaths of his first wife and daughter in 1972 and his oldest son, Beau, in 2015, made him a better human being. &quot;He has humanity and he has compassion for other human beings because he&#x27;s seen a lot of rough stuff himself. I don&#x27;t generally trust most politicians but I trust [Biden] to be who he is and I think he&#x27;s going to do a good job.&quot; In May 2022, Crosby wrote in response to a pro-union tweet from Biden that &quot;most Unions are useless and totally dishonest.&quot;

=== Acting career ===

During the early 1990s, Crosby appeared as a guest star in several episodes of &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;, where he played the part of Larroquette&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsor. He appeared on a TV episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot; as the singer–husband of one of Roseanne&#x27;s co-workers, who was played by Bonnie Bramlett. He sang the Danny Sheridan composition &quot;Roll On Down&quot; on that episode. He was on an episode of &quot;Ellen&quot; called &quot;Ellen Unplugged&quot;, in which he was helping out at the Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp. He also appeared as a pirate in the 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;, as a 1970s hippie in the 1991 film &quot;Backdraft,&quot; and as a bartender in the 1992 film &quot;Thunderheart&quot;. Crosby also voiced himself on two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Marge in Chains&quot; and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot;.

=== Drugs, alcohol, and arrests ===
Crosby spent nine months in a Texas state prison after being convicted of several drugs and weapons offenses in 1985. The drug charges were related to possession of heroin and cocaine.

Later in 1985, Crosby was arrested in California for drunken driving, a hit-and-run driving accident, and possession of a concealed pistol and drug paraphernalia. He was arrested after driving into a fence in a Marin County suburb, where officers found a .45-caliber pistol and cocaine in his car.

On March 7, 2004, Crosby was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, illegal possession of a hunting knife, illegal possession of ammunition, and illegal possession of about one ounce of marijuana. He left the items behind in his New York City hotel room. Authorities said a &quot;hotel employee searched the suitcase for identification and found about an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers, two knives, and a .45-caliber pistol. Mr. Crosby was arrested when he returned to the hotel to pick up his bag.&quot; After spending 12 hours in jail, he was released on $3,500 bail. Crosby pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to attempted criminal possession of a weapon on July 4, 2004; he was fined $5,000 and received no jail time. Prosecutors did not seek a more severe penalty on the weapons charge because the pistol was registered in California and was stowed safely in his luggage when it was found. A charge of unlawful possession of marijuana was dismissed. Crosby was discharged by the court on condition that he pay his fine and not get arrested again.

=== Health issues and death ===

Crosby was the recipient of a highly publicized liver
 transplant, paid for by Phil Collins, in 1994. News of his transplant led to public discussions because of his celebrity status and his previous problems with alcoholism and drug use. Crosby&#x27;s liver problems stemmed from a long run with hepatitis C.

Crosby suffered from type 2 diabetes. During an October 2008 concert, Crosby, looking much thinner than in previous years, announced to the audience that he had recently shed as a result of his struggles with the disease.

In February 2014, at the urging of his doctor, Crosby postponed the final dates of his solo tour to undergo a cardiac catheterization and angiogram, based on the results of a routine cardiac stress test.

Crosby died in Santa Ynez, California, on January 18, 2023, at the age of 81. Believing he was &quot;probably going to die fairly soon&quot;, Crosby had planned his funeral at least three years prior to his death. It was to be held at his horse ranch in Santa Ynez, in the hope that he would be reconciled with his former Byrds and CSN bandmates so that they would attend. A statement from his family said that he died &quot;after a long illness&quot;. However, friends and colleagues described his death as &quot;sudden&quot;, saying that Crosby had remained active until the day of his death, working on plans for a tour and a new album. Rumors circulated that his death was due to complications from COVID-19 and on January 23, Stephen Stills&#x27;s ex-wife Véronique Sanson appeared on French television and stated that Crosby had died in his sleep from complications from the virus. &quot;He was on his fifth day, went to take a nap, and never woke up again.&quot; Her son Chris Stills was due to undertake a tour with Crosby in February.

<text>Emmendingen (German: &quot;Landkreis Emmendingen&quot;) is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the west of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (from north clockwise) Ortenaukreis, Schwarzwald-Baar, Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and the district-free city Freiburg. To the west it borders the French &quot;département&quot; Bas-Rhin.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Bezirksamt Emmendingen&quot;, which was created in 1803 when the area became part of Baden. After several additions it was converted into the district Emmendingen in 1936, when it was merged with the &quot;Amt Waldkirch&quot;. In the communal reform of 1973 the district wasn&#x27;t changed - at first it was planned to merge it with the district Lahr, but that was merged into the Ortenaukreis instead.

==Geography==
The western part of the district is located in the upper Rhine valley, including the small volcanic mountain Kaiserstuhl. This extinct volcano is one of the climatic best regions of Germany, with wine grapes growing on its sunny slopes. The eastern part of the district belongs to the Black Forest.

==Coat of arms==
The left side of the coat of arms show the symbol of Baden. The six-topped mountain in the top right is the symbol of the Lords of Schwarzenberg, who ruled over the land around Elzach and Waldkirch; the wing in the bottom right is the symbol of the Lords of Üsenberg, who owned the land around Endingen, Herbolzheim and Kenzingen.

<text>Wilhelm Johann Harald Hoegner (23 September 1887 – 5 March 1980) was the second Bavarian minister-president after World War II (1945–1946 and 1954–1957), and the father of the Bavarian constitution. He has been the only Social Democrat to hold this office since 1920.

== Early life ==
Wilhelm Hoegner was born in Munich in 1887, the son of Michael Georg Hoegner and Therese Engelhardt. Growing up in Burghausen, he studied law in Munich, Berlin and Erlangen. After graduation, he worked as a lawyer, then as a &quot;Staatsanwalt&quot;, a state prosecutor. In 1919 he became a member of the SPD. He married Anna Woock in 1918, with whom he had two children.

== Interwar politics and exile ==
From 1924 to 1930, Hoegner was a Social Democratic member of the Landtag of Bavaria. He was involved in the investigation into Hitler&#x27;s Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and through this became part of the opposition to the Nazis. He published, anonymously, a paper on the findings of the investigation, which is considered an important historical document due to the fact that the Nazis destroyed all official reports from the inquest after 1933. He actively opposed Hitler in his time as a member of the German Reichstag from 1930 to 1933. For this reason, he was dismissed from government service after the Nazi takeover in 1933 and had to escape to Austria, and from there, in 1934, to Switzerland, where he worked as a freelance writer. He was in contact there with other German refugees from the Nazis and worked with them in an organisation called &quot;Demokratisches Deutschland&quot;, aimed against the Nazis.

== Postwar politics ==
Upon his return to Bavaria in June 1945, he served at the court in Munich. He became minister-president of Bavaria from 1945 to 1946, after the sudden dismissal of Fritz Schäffer, also holding the post of Minister of Justice until 1947. He became known at this time as the father of the new Bavarian constitution. After losing the December 1946 election, he was replaced as Bavarian minister-president by Hans Ehard but remained as Minister of Justice. When his party decided to leave the coalition with the Christian Social Union (CSU), he opposed this move and temporarily lost influence within the SPD, resigning from his ministerial post.

From 1946 to 1970, he was again a member of the Bavarian Landtag (parliament), leading the SPD faction there from 1958 to 1962. He held the post of Minister of the Interior from 1950 to 1954, when Bavaria was ruled by a CSU-SPD coalition. During this time, he devoted a great deal of effort towards the reunification of the Palatinate with the rest of Bavaria, but ultimately failed, as only 7.6 percent of all eligible voters in the Palatinate voted for reunification.

He became minister-president of Bavaria for a second time in 1954, when he led a four-party grand coalition government until 1957. The coalition fell apart before the end of its term after the 1957 federal elections and, as of 2018, Wilhelm Hoegner is still the last non-CSU minister-president of Bavaria.

He was also a member of the German Bundestag from 1961 to 1962.

While a social democrat, Hoegner was not a doctrinaire socialist, and he always preferred a common-sense approach to politics and the economy, rather than radical theories. He considered being a social democrat to be wholly compatible with Christian ethics and values—an important factor in the traditionally conservative and Catholic-dominated state of Bavaria.

Hoegner died, aged 92, almost blind but mentally still in full capacity, on 5 March 1980 in Munich.

<text>Weird Science is a 1985 American teen science fantasy comedy film written and directed by John Hughes and starring Anthony Michael Hall, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, and Kelly LeBrock. It is based on the 1951 pre-Comics Code comic &quot;Made of the Future&quot; by Al Feldstein, which appeared in the magazine of the same name. The title song was written and performed by American new wave band Oingo Boingo. The film is regarded as a cult classic.

==Plot==
Nerdy social outcast students Gary Wallace and Wyatt Donnelly of Shermer High School are humiliated by senior jocks Ian and Max for swooning over their cheerleader girlfriends Deb and Hilly. Humiliated and disappointed at their direction in life and wanting more, Gary convinces the uptight Wyatt that they need a boost in popularity in order to win their crushes away from Ian and Max. Alone for the weekend with Wyatt&#x27;s parents gone, Gary is inspired by the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; to create a virtual woman using Wyatt&#x27;s computer, infusing her with everything they can conceive of to make the perfect dream woman.

After they hook electrodes to a doll and hack into a government computer system for more power, a power surge creates Lisa, a beautiful and intelligent woman with reality-warping powers. She promptly produces a pink 1959 Cadillac Eldorado convertible to take the boys to a blues dive bar in Chicago, using her powers to procure fake IDs for them.

They return home drunk, where Chet, Wyatt&#x27;s mean older brother, extorts $175 from Wyatt in exchange for his silence. Lisa agrees to keep herself hidden from him, but she realizes that Gary and Wyatt, while sweet, are very uptight and need to unwind. After another humiliating experience at the mall when Max and Ian pour a slushie on Gary and Wyatt in front of a crowd, Lisa tells the bullies about a party at Wyatt&#x27;s house, before driving off in a Porsche 928 she conjured for Gary.

Despite Wyatt&#x27;s protests, Lisa insists that the party take place. She meets Gary&#x27;s parents, Al and Lucy, who are shocked and dismayed at the things she says and her frank manner, to Gary&#x27;s embarrassment. After she pulls a stainless .44 Magnum on them (later revealed to Gary to be a water pistol), she alters their memories so that Lucy forgets about the conflict; however, Al forgets that they have a son altogether.

At the Donnelly house, the party has spun out of control. Gary and Wyatt take refuge in the bathroom, where they resolve to have fun despite having embarrassed themselves in front of Deb and Hilly. In Wyatt&#x27;s bedroom, Ian and Max convince Gary and Wyatt to recreate the events that created Lisa, but the process fails. Lisa chides them over their misuse of the process to impress their tormentors. She also explains that they forgot to connect the doll; thus, with the bare but live electrodes resting on a magazine page showing a Pershing II medium-range ballistic missile, a real missile emerges, erupting through the floor and ceiling of the house.

Meanwhile, Wyatt&#x27;s grandparents arrive and confront Lisa about the party, but she places them in a frozen, catatonic state and hides them in a kitchen cupboard. Lisa realizes that the boys need a challenge to boost their confidence and has a gang of mutant bikers crash the party, causing chaos and terrorizing the guests.

When the bikers take Deb and Hilly hostage, Wyatt and Gary confront them, causing Deb and Hilly to fall in love with them. The bikers leave, and the next morning, Chet returns from duck hunting to discover the house in disarray, including a localized snowstorm in his room, and the missile. Lisa has the boys escort the girls home while she talks to Chet alone. Gary and Wyatt proclaim their feelings, and both girls reciprocate.

Returning to the house, the boys discover Chet, now transformed into a foul, talking toad-like creature. He apologizes to Wyatt for his behavior. Upstairs, Lisa assures them that Chet will soon return to normal, and, realizing that her purpose is complete, tearfully hugs both Gary and Wyatt before de-materializing. As she leaves, the house is &quot;magically&quot; cleaned and everything transformed back to normal, including Chet. Wyatt&#x27;s parents return home, completely unaware that anything unusual has happened. Later, Lisa turns up as the new gym teacher at Shermer High School.

==Cast==

In addition, Hughes regular John Kapelos plays Dino, while &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate Kym Malin (May 1982) has a cameo as a girl playing piano.

==Production==
Model Kelly Emberg was initially cast as Lisa, but she left after two days due to creative differences. LeBrock was hired as her replacement.
Vernon Wells reprises his memorable biker character Wez from &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, but is credited in this movie as &quot;Lord General&quot;. Filming was originally planned to begin on September 24, 1984, in Skokie, Illinois but was ultimately delayed to October 2, 1984, and the location changed to the Northbrook Court Shopping Mall in Northbrook, Illinois.

Most of the location shooting was filmed around neighborhoods outside of Chicago, Illinois, whereas the rest of production was filmed on sound stages and the backlot at Universal City Studios in Los Angeles, California. Production wrapped on December 21, 1984. The production was kept closed in order to keep the film&#x27;s plot a secret.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert, who gave the film three out of four stars, called LeBrock &quot;wonderful&quot; in her role and thought that as a result the film was &quot;funnier, and a little deeper, than the predictable story it might have been&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mr. Hughes shows that he can share the kind of dumb joke that only a 14-year old boy could love. There are enough moviegoing 14-year old boys to make a hit out of &quot;Weird Science&quot;, of course, but for the rest of the population, its pandering is strenuous enough to be cause for alarm.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Weird Science&quot; is not nearly as weird as it should have been and, in fact, is a rather conventional kids-in-heat film, and a chaste one at that. Director-writer John Hughes squanders the opportunity to comment on the power struggle between the sexes for a few easy laughs.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;What a disappointment &quot;Weird Science&quot; is! A wonderful writer-director has taken a cute idea about two teenage Dr. Frankensteins creating a perfect woman by computer and turned it into a vulgar, mindless, special-effects-cluttered wasteland.&quot;

Sheila Benson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described LeBrock as &quot;triumphant&quot; and the &quot;film&#x27;s greatest asset&quot;, but thought the film&#x27;s appeal was limited to audiences of 15-year-old boys and &quot;&quot;maybe&quot; the 16-year olds, if they aren&#x27;t yet too fussy&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Unbelievably, John Hughes, the maker of &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, writes and directs this snickering, sordid, special effects fantasy, with Kelly LeBrock in a demeaning role as love slave to a pair of 15-year olds.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 60% based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Hardly in the same league as John Hughes&#x27; other teen movies, the resolutely goofy &quot;Weird Science&quot; nonetheless gets some laughs via its ridiculous premise and enjoyable performances.&quot;

===Box office===
It grossed $23,834,048 in North America and $15.1 million in other territories, totaling $38,934,048 worldwide.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, was performed by Oingo Boingo and written by the band&#x27;s frontman, Danny Elfman. The soundtrack album was released on MCA Records.

==Legacy==
===Television series===

A television series based on the film ran for 88 episodes, from 1994 to 1998. Following the same basic plot as the film, the series starred Vanessa Angel as Lisa, Michael Manasseri as Wyatt, John Mallory Asher as Gary, and Lee Tergesen as Chet.

===Remake and sequel===
, Universal Studios was planning a &quot;Weird Science&quot; remake with original producer Joel Silver returning, and Michael Bacall writing the film. The film was set to attempt to distinguish itself from the original &quot;Weird Science&quot; by being an edgier comedy, in line with &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and &quot;The Hangover&quot;, which were R-rated; the studio stated the rating for this &quot;Weird Science&quot; remake was not certain at that stage of the movie&#x27;s development. However, as of mid-2024, nothing of the remake had materialized. In 2017, Ilan Mitchell-Smith talked about a sequel to &quot;Weird Science&quot; starring Channing Tatum.

<text>Karl Carstens (; 14 December 1914 – 30 May 1992) was a German politician. He served as the president of West Germany from 1979 to 1984.

==Early life and education==
Carstens was born in the City of Bremen, the son of a commercial school teacher, who had been killed at the Western Front of World War I shortly before his birth. He studied law and political science at the universities of Frankfurt, Dijon, Munich, Königsberg, and Hamburg from 1933 to 1936, gaining a doctorate in 1938 and taking the Second &quot;Staatsexamen&quot; degree in 1939. In 1949 he also received a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree from Yale Law School.

==World War II==

From 1939 to 1945, during the Second World War, Carstens was a member of an anti-aircraft artillery (&quot;Flak&quot;) unit in the Luftwaffe, reaching the rank of &quot;Leutnant&quot; (Second Lieutenant) by the war&#x27;s end. In 1940 he joined the Nazi Party; reportedly, he had applied for admission in 1937 to avoid detrimental treatment when he worked as a law clerk. He had, however, joined the Nazi &quot;SA&quot; paramilitary organisation already in 1934.

==Post-war years==
In 1944 Carstens married the medical student Veronica Prior in Berlin. After the war he became a lawyer in his hometown Bremen, and from 1949 acted as a councillor of the city&#x27;s Senate. From 1950 he also worked as lecturer at the University of Cologne, where he habilitated two years later. In 1954 he joined the diplomatic service of the German Foreign Office, serving as West German representative at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. In 1955 he joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

In July 1960 Carstens reached the position of secretary of state at the Foreign Office and in the same year was also appointed as professor for public and international law at University of Cologne. During the grand coalition government of 1966-1969 under Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, he first served as secretary of state in the Ministry of Defence, and after 1968 as head of the German Chancellery.

In 1972 Carstens was first elected into the Bundestag, of which he was a member until 1979. From May 1973 until October 1976 he was chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, succeeding Rainer Barzel. During that time he was an outspoken critic of left-wing tendencies in the German student movement and particular accused the governing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) of being too soft on left-wing extremists. He also famously denounced the author and Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll as a supporter of left-wing terrorism (specifically, the Baader-Meinhof Gang) for his 1974 novel &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot;.

After the 1976 federal elections, which made the CDU/CSU the largest group in parliament, Carstens was elected president of the Bundestag on 14 December 1976. The CDU/CSU had also reached a majority in the Federal Convention electing the President of Germany, and in 1979 the party nominated Carstens, though in contestation due to his Nazi past, as candidate, whereafter incumbent President Walter Scheel (FDP) chose to renounce a second term.

==President of West Germany==

On 23 May 1979, Carstens was elected as the fifth President of the Federal Republic of Germany, prevailing against the SPD candidate Annemarie Renger in the first ballot. During his term of office, Carstens was well known for hiking Germany in order to decrease the gulf between politics and the people.

In December 1982, the new Chancellor Helmut Kohl (CDU), recently elected in a successful motion of no confidence against Helmut Schmidt (SPD) deliberately lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, in order to obtain a clearer majority in new general elections. Though already former Chancellor Willy Brandt had similarly proceeded in 1972, this action gave rise to a discussion whether such a step constitutes a &quot;manipulation of the Constitution&quot;. On 7 January 1983, President Carstens nonetheless dissolved the Bundestag and called for new elections. In February 1983 his decision was approved by the Federal Constitutional Court so that 1983 general elections could take place on 6 March.

In 1984 Carstens decided not to seek a second term on account of his age and left office on 30 June 1984. He was succeeded by Richard von Weizsäcker.

Carstens was a member of the Protestant Church in Germany.
