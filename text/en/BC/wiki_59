<text>Ingersoll is a town in Oxford County on the Thames River in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The nearest cities are Woodstock to the east and London to the west.

Ingersoll is situated north of and along Highway 401. Oxford County Road 119 (formerly Ontario Highway 19) runs north diagonally through the town. A Canadian National rail line bisects the town east to west through its centre. Passenger service from the Ingersoll train station is provided to other stops in Southwestern Ontario by Via Rail. To the south is the Ontario Southland Railway (former CN) line, with spurs into local industries, which provides freight service to points in the region. The local high school is Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute.

The Ingersoll area was first settled in the 1790s by families from New England, became famous for homemade cheese production before the War of 1812, and its surrounding County of Oxford was home to the first cheese factories in Canada, starting in 1864. In 1866, through collaboration by the town&#x27;s businessmen, a giant wheel of cheese weighing was produced at the James Harris Cheese Factory just south of Ingersoll, for promotion of the area&#x27;s cheese industry. The &quot;Mammoth Cheese&quot; was exhibited at the New York State Fair in Saratoga, NY, and then in England. It was a &quot;Eureka!&quot; accomplishment applauded by the whole country, and in 1867 the Canadian Dairymen&#x27;s Association was established in Ingersoll, attended by nearly two hundred dairymen from across Canada, followed by annual conventions long thereafter. A booming cheese export industry in the millions of pounds grew from Ingersoll to many parts of the world, and the town&#x27;s name became synonymous with quality products.

Ingersoll also developed as an industrial centre. During the late 19th century, the town&#x27;s largest industries were &quot;Noxon Bros.&quot;, a manufacturer of farm implements (1856-1916) and the &quot;Ingersoll Packing Co.&quot;, a cheese-exporting and pork-packing firm (1880-1920s). The Noxons&#x27; firm was shuttered in 1916, but other large industries took root during the early 20th century, including the &quot;St. Charles Condensing Co.&quot; (later &quot;Borden&#x27;s Condensed Milk&quot;), the &quot;Morrow Screw &amp; Nut Co.&quot;, the &quot;Ingersoll Machine and Tool Co.&quot;, and the &quot;Ingersoll Cream Cheese Company&quot;.

In the 21st century, heavy manufacturing is Ingersoll&#x27;s largest industry, including CAMI Assembly, a General Motors car manufacturing plant. Originally a joint venture established in 1986 with Suzuki Motors of Canada, it has produced millions of vehicles.

Ingersoll is twinned with Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

==Early history==

Ingersoll&#x27;s founder, Thomas Ingersoll (1749–1812), was a native of Westfield, Massachusetts who moved to Great Barrington, Massachusetts in the early 1770s, and then to Queenston in the Niagara District, Upper Canada in 1795, where he operated an inn while organizing his grand venture to create a new settlement deep in the Upper Canadian wilderness. In 1793 he and associates had received grant of Oxford township, which became the site of the community of Oxford-on-the-Thames, and where he opened roads, established a farm for his family and settled dozens of other families on their own farms nearby. Further rights to the township were revoked in 1798, and Ingersoll&#x27;s own grant was limited to 1200 acres (486 ha). Discouraged by this and the resulting slow pace of the settlement, Thomas withdrew his family from Oxford in 1806 and took up operation of a government-owned inn and ferry at Port Credit, but after his death the family decided to return to the Oxford homestead, at first Thomas Jr. (1796-1847) with James (1801-1886) in 1818, then his widow Sarah and his other children in 1821 along with eldest son Charles (1791-1832) and Charles&#x27; wife and children. Together Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s four sons laid the foundations for the hamlet of Ingersoll. Thomas&#x27;s eldest daughter, Laura Secord (1775-1868), who had married in 1797, had distinguished herself as a heroine of the War of 1812, and remained with her husband and children in Queenston.

The hamlet of Ingersoll was proclaimed a village in 1852 and a town in 1865. Whereas Woodstock, the County seat, was Oxford County&#x27;s administrative centre, Ingersoll became the county&#x27;s principal industrial centre, in 1871 home to all four of the County&#x27;s industries that had 50 or more hands. Noxon Brothers and the Eastwood foundry, both manufacturers of agricultural implements, employed 103 and 70 hands respectively. With 4,022 in population in 1871, Ingersoll&#x27;s population surpassed that of Woodstock (3,982), although its advantage was not to last. By the 1860s, dairying was an emerging industry, sparked farm-wife production of cheese and butter, and then by the introduction of the factory system of cheese production in 1864. In 1866, to promote Ingersoll cheese as a high-quality, standardized brand, a cheese producer, James Harris, and local businessmen produced a 7,300-pound mammoth cheese, exhibited it at the New York State Fair in Saratoga, N.Y., and then exported it to England.

== Annual town events ==

Ingersoll was home to the fall fair of the Ingersoll, North and West Oxford Agricultural Society (founded 1847) for more than a century. In 1967 it was succeeded by the Ingersoll Cheese and Wine Festival, which continued for two decades, featuring a variety of events, zaniest of which was the Mayors&#x27; Grape Stomp contest, in which the mayors from other communities, appearing in a boxing ring at the town&#x27;s arena in front of cheering crowds, competed with Ingersoll&#x27;s mayor to stomp the greatest quantity of juice from each one&#x27;s bathtub full of grapes. From this later came Harvest Fest, a multi-day event which has now been divided into Harvest Fest, Pumpkin Fest and Kiwanis Rural Urban Dinner Night events. In 1999 a free folk festival was launched which continues each July as the Canterbury Folk Festival. For a number of years there was a Ribfest and an arts program known as the Halls Creek Festival. The year ends with Santa&#x27;s Village weekends and parade and Winter Lights Festival.

== Cultural resources ==
=== Fusion Youth Centre ===

As part of a community strategic plan developed in 2003, Ingersoll Town Council adopted a vision statement that “Youth will be encouraged to achieve a high sense of purpose, of identity and of pride for, and within their community.” Towards this, the Fusion Youth Centre was developed by the town in a former elementary school property on Thames Street, which offers after-school and weekend programs and special events for any and all youth between ages 12 and 18, using the centre&#x27;s meeting rooms, computer equipment, skatepark, recording studio, TV studio, gym, cafeteria and kitchen. Some of the creative work from the centre is posted on its YouTube channel at FusionIngersoll.

=== Ingersoll Seniors Activity Centre ===
Operating from a former residential and recreation complex built for Suzuki employees involved in management in the early years at the CAMI auto plant, Ingersoll Services for Seniors organizes a full calendar of social programs.

=== Ingersoll Cheese and Agricultural Museum and Sports Hall of Fame ===
Ingersoll has the distinction of having been Oxford County&#x27;s cheese capital from the mid-1800s to early 1900s, producing and packaging a good deal of the county&#x27;s renowned cheddar. The museum showcases the town&#x27;s unique history. It opened in 1977, consisting of a re-creation of a 19th century cheese factory. Buildings that are part of the museum include: a working blacksmith shop, two barns, a bread oven and a schoolhouse portraying two different time periods of one room schools. The agricultural barns were built from lumber and timbers taken from barns found in Oxford County. It required the barn board and beams to be reclaimed from three existing barn buildings in the area. The buildings were disassembled and materials transported to the site where these building now stand. Construction was done by hand like the original process. No power tools were used in the construction of these buildings. Workers worked from a single photograph of the original Old Ingersoll Cheese Factory. The buildings were completed within 3 months by a crew of approximately 6 people from the Ingersoll area.

The Sports Hall of Fame showcases the town&#x27;s athletic history. 
&quot;Path of the Giants&quot; – a 20-foot (6 m) &quot;fully round&quot; wood carved scene by the late Wilson Johnston, depicting the pioneer trek of his ancestors, the &quot;Dunkards&quot; from Lancaster, Pennsylvania to Cambridge, Ontario in the 1700s.

=== Ingersoll Creative Arts Centre ===
Started in 1972, this active arts centre features an exhibit gallery as well as offering classes in a variety of arts and crafts in pottery, painting and fibre arts studios. This arts centre is located at 125 Centennial Lane.

=== Ingersoll Pipe Band ===
Well known and respected, the Ingersoll Pipe Band is Canada&#x27;s Oldest, Non-Military, Independent Pipe Band. Beginning in 1910 with two brothers, Jack and James Little, their cousin William Collins, and Pipe Major Tom Johnston the band was formed. For over 100 years the band has attracted many talented players, competed and traveled world wide making great memories, friends and sharing music. The band hall is the site for practices and offers lessons to those interested in learning to play.

=== Ingersoll Public Library ===
A branch of the Oxford County Library. It is located in the Ingersoll Municipal Building. War Memorial and Honour Roll are located on the south side of the Town Centre. In the lobby are a statue and plaque to honour Thomas Ingersoll, the founder of Ingersoll. The former library was a Carnegie library located near the corner of Thames and Charles Streets.

=== Ingersoll Theatre of Performing Arts ===
Several amateur productions are presented each year by ITOPA in the former Park Place Theatre, the town&#x27;s second cinema, which has received several upgrades since 2011 to help improve the experience of its patrons.

=== Media ===
The young village&#x27;s first newspaper was the Ingersoll Chronicle, begun as a weekly in 1853 and operating as both a weekly and daily starting in the 1890s, by which time it was the second-largest in the county. It ceased publication in 1919 and its offices became the Ingersoll branch of the Woodstock Sentinel-Review, the county&#x27;s largest and only other daily newspaper. Starting from the 1860s, Ingersoll always had more than one newspaper published in town, sometimes several. The longest-running was the Oxford Tribune, later renamed the Ingersoll Tribune, which published as a weekly from the 1870s to the 1970s. It succumbed to competition from the Ingersoll Times, a weekly which operated for nearly fifty years before ceasing publication in 2018. A complete archive of bound volumes of the Ingersoll Chronicle which was being housed in the lower level of the Carnegie Library building was destroyed by flooding in 1976. An online archive of the Ingersoll Times spanning the internet era disappeared when its website was shut down by the newspaper&#x27;s owner, Sun Media, soon after print publication ceased. As of 2018, Ingersoll is served with a monthly public announcements newsletter published in Thamesford, the Village Voice page. The Woodstock Ingersoll Echo, a new monthly newspaper, is scheduled to be launched on June 16, 2023.

==Transportation==
Ingersoll is served by Via Rail Canada at Ingersoll station on the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor.
London International Airport is the closest international airport. The closest large airport is Toronto Pearson International Airport.

==Sports and recreation facilities==
The town of Ingersoll maintains more than 20 parks with various playgrounds, baseball diamonds, basketball courts and tennis courts as well as several nature trails. It also has several indoor facilities.

=== Ingersoll District Memorial Centre ===
For nearly sixty years the home of hockey and large-gathering indoor events in Ingersoll, this facility has a regulation-size rink, change rooms, shops, and an upstairs auditorium. The boys hockey and girls hockey leagues use the largest blocks of available ice time and also make use of available time at the arena buildings in nearby Thamesford and Embro. Planning is underway in Ingersoll for a new facility which eventually will have two rinks, an upper level walking track, and an indoor basketball court.

=== Victoria Park Community Centre ===
Ingersoll displays its spirit of renaissance with construction of this indoor pool and fitness complex at Victoria Park, a rebuild and renovation of the original pool built in the 1940s from public donations. The town publishes a full range of aquatics and fitness programs based at this facility.

=== Ingersoll Seniors Resource Centre ===
Operating from a former residential and recreation complex built for Suzuki employees involved in management in the early years at the CAMI auto plant, the Seniors Resource Centre provides support services for senior citizens.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ingersoll had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Education==

Public education is managed by the Thames Valley District School Board (TVDSB), who oversee three elementary schools; (Harrisfield Public School (formerly Harris Heights Public School), Royal Roads Public School (formerly Princess Anne Public School) and Laurie Hawkins Public School. The TVDSB also manages Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute. The current building for IDCI opened in 1954. It replaced the older, smaller building of the Ingersoll Collegiate. As a district school, it draws students from outlying rural and village communities, transported into Ingersoll by school bus.

Catholic education is under the administration of the London District Catholic School Board, who manage one elementary school in Ingersoll; St. Jude&#x27;s Catholic School.

=== Historical schools ===
* Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute: The initial section of the current building was constructed in 1953, and large extensions were added in the 1960s and the 1970s, raising its capacity to serve more than a thousand students drawn by bus from a large radius inside and outside town. The original school from the 1870s was demolished in 1954. A cairn and plaque mark its original location in the front parking lot. The gymnasium building from the original school was saved and moved to a site on Kensington Avenue where it became the Peoples Revival Centre. It was demolished in 2015 to make way for eight new houses.
* Princess Elizabeth Public School: It originally opened in the same year as Canada&#x27;s Confederation – 1867. The current building includes the one that opened as a replacement in 1909. This school was closed and was taken over by Vedic Institute of Canada in May, 2014.
* Victory Memorial Public School: Built in 1920, Victory Memorial School was named in honour of Canada&#x27;s participation and victory in the First World War. It replaced Central Public School, built in 1850. The property had served as the site of Ingersoll&#x27;s first school starting in the 1820s. Victory Memorial was closed in 2015, and the building has been repurposed as a seniors residence. The two cannons mounted in front were a gift to the town from the federal government in the early 1900s. They were cast in Great Britain and date from the reign of King George III, and most likely saw service in the War of 1812.
* Sacred Heart School: Originally founded in the early 20th century, two schools of this name have existed immediately next door to Sacred Heart Church on Thames Street North. This was the original Catholic school in Ingersoll, and from the 1970s onwards it typically held the grades three through eight, with the primary grades one and two and kindergarten classes taught at St. Jude&#x27;s Catholic School. Sacred Heart School was closed and the classes transferred to an enlarged St. Jude&#x27;s Catholic School in 2006. The school building itself was converted soon after into The Fusion Centre.

== Social issues ==
===Ingersoll Train Station===
Ingersoll has been losing its historic landmarks to the process of &#x27;demolition by neglect&#x27;. The proud old 19th-century CN passenger station in the middle of town has deteriorated to the verge of collapse and has recently been demolished. (June 2021) .

===Carmeuse Environmental Issues/Walker Megadump===
Residents of Ingersoll and surrounding area have been in a militant state of opposition since the announcement in 2012 that the international conglomerate Carmeuse intends to give a 20-year lease to Walker Industries to operate a megadump taking in garbage from Toronto and London to fill the spent portion of the limestone quarry operated by Carmeuse on nearly 2,000 acres (809 ha) stretching east and north from Ingersoll&#x27;s eastern boundary. Walker has referenced plans to use the quarry site for a multi-use &#x27;campus&#x27; for garbage and recycling operations. Carmeuse has also announced plans to switch to burning garbage in its kilns, which must be heated to to process limestone into industrial lime. As a preliminary step, it will conduct a pilot Alternative Low-Carbon Fuels (“ALCF”) project to assess pollution levels that result from burning &#x27;engineered&#x27; garbage to be trucked in from New York state. Longterm, ALCF garbage to be burned would include non-recyclable paper and plastic packaging materials, cardboard/paper sludge, non-recyclable rubber and plastic from automotive manufacturing, nylon tire fluff/belting, waste materials from diaper manufacturers, and wood refuse. This could also include farm waste. The impact of all this on quality of life for the surrounding human population will be immense, and could continue for centuries.

== Historical figures ==
* Thomas Ingersoll (1749–1812) b. Westfield, Mass., removed to Great Barrington, Berkshire County, Mass., in the early 1770s where his uncles were already prominent citizens, and then to Queenston, Niagara District, Upper Canada, in 1795. While in Great Barrington he married three times, was involved in a number of businesses including partnership in a mill, joined the Episcopal (Anglican) church, and rose through the ranks of the local militia, achieving the rank of Major. With associates from Berkshire County he received grant of Oxford-on-the-Thames township in Upper Canada in 1793, and from his new base as an innkeeper at Queenston devoted his energy and resources for the next five years to opening the Oxford wilderness for dozens of families to settle there. Started his own farm within the settlement on land along the creek best suited to a millsite, which became the site of the modern town of Ingersoll. His township rights were revoked in 1798 and reduced to a grant of . Discouraged, he ceased his promotion of settlement in Oxford in 1806, moved the family and launched a new career as the government innkeeper and ferryman at Port Credit, but his sons returned to the family homestead in Oxford starting in 1818 and laid the foundations for the hamlet of Ingersoll.
* Laura Ingersoll Secord (1775–1868). Daughter of Thomas Ingersoll and wife of James Secord, who served in the militia under Isaac Brock. The couple lived in St. Davids (now Queenston) where American troops stopped at their home seeking supplies during the War of 1812. On June 21, 1813, Laura Secord overheard plans of a surprise attack on British Troops led by Lt. James Fitzgibbon at Beaver Dams. Secord was responsible for walking 20 miles (32 km) through the woods, in newly controlled American territory in the Niagara Peninsula, to Beaver Dams to warn the British. As a result of this information Lt. Fitzgibbon&#x27;s small British troop and a larger contingent of allied Mohawk warriors were able to intercept and defeat the attack. Although not initially recognized for her role, Lt. James Fitzgibbon later certified that the informant was Laura Secord. Secord&#x27;s story has often been embellished over the years but her role in Canadian history has since been established by various historians. Secord was never a resident of Oxford County, and possibly never visited Ingersoll, although she and her kin were highly mobile. On hearing her father had suffered a massive stroke in early 1812, she hurriedly made the 60-mile (96 km) journey to Port Credit and arrived the day before his death. In the fall of 1818, her home in Queenston became the focus of many family gatherings as Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s brother-in-law John Whiting visited from Great Barrington, Massachusetts, travelled to Port Credit to visit his sister Sarah (Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s widow), and took Sarah back with him to Great Barrington for further family reunions (it is believed that her son Charles Ingersoll went to Great Barrington in early 1819 to accompany his mother back to Canada, while sons Thomas Ingersoll Jr. and James Ingersoll were busy rebuilding the family farm in Oxford).
* Hall, Canfield, Whiting, Carroll and Harris families. On the departure of Thomas Ingersoll and family from the Oxford settlement in 1806, leadership passed to the other New England families he had encouraged to settle near him within what became the first town boundaries (roughly Harris Street in the east to Whiting Street in the west). Command of the neighbourhood within the Oxford Militia passed to Captain Ichabod Hall (1774-1814), who with brother Samuel had come with Ingersoll from the Great Barrington area in 1797. Ichabod was also W.M. of the Masonic Lodge in the settlement at the time of his death, which came two weeks after his involvement in a skirmish between Upper Canada militia and American raiders in what is now London, Ontario. Ichabod&#x27;s son Elisha Hall (1800-1868) eventually took over the family farm, which included the land which is now Centennial Park and Victoria Park. Ichabod&#x27;s daughter Clarissa (1803-1884) married Daniel Carroll (1805-1873), and their son Dr. D.W. Carroll (1838-1912) made creation of Memorial Park possible.

* Charles Ingersoll (1791–1832), Thomas Ingersoll Jr. (1796-1847), James Ingersoll (1801–1886) and Samuel Ingersoll (1806-1861). Sons of Thomas Ingersoll. Thomas Jr. and James were the first to return in 1818, constructing a mill pond, spillway, and raceway to drive a sawmill, which was put into operation for the first time in April 1819, lumber from which was then used to build a new family home. Charles was a comrade-in-arms, business partner and brother-in-law of William Hamilton Merritt, the St. Catharines merchant, miller, canal promoter, Tory politician, and Charles&#x27;s financial backer. Charles was MP for the Oxford riding 1824–28 and 1830–32. Died of cholera in 1832. During the 1820s, the Ingersoll brothers established businesses – a grist mill, a store, a distillery, and an ashery – which became the nucleus for the hamlet of Ingersoll (a village 1852 and a town, 1865). James was appointed county land registrar in 1835, which eventually necessitated his move to Woodstock when it became the county seat in the 1840s. Thomas Jr. and Samuel were invited by the Canada Company in 1839 to build the first mills in Blanshard Township at St. Marys, and they again became town founders there.

* McNab, Crotty, Carnegie, Holcroft and Rothwell families. By the start of the 1830s the hamlet had extended beyond the Ingersoll family ventures clustered around their millpond, and families from Ireland, Scotland and England were setting down roots, particularly on the vacant land north of it, which had remained dormant in the hands of speculators until then. Between them, Crotty (from Ireland, 1831), Carnegie (Scotland, 1834) and Rothwell (Ireland, 1834) became the owners of most of it. McNab, from Scotland via Ireland, probably came with or around the same time as Crotty. McNab and wife fell victim to the same cholera epidemic that took Charles Ingersoll in 1832. James Ingersoll became guardian of the five orphaned McNab children. Holcroft, from England, had commanded the Royal Artillery regiment in Upper Canada during the War of 1812, and became owner of large blocks of land including what is now the Ingersoll golf course. These families soon joined in collaboration with the Ingersolls and others to steer projects to improve the community. Crotty in particular led the effort in the 1840s to ensure the area&#x27;s first railway would be built through the centre of the growing village rather than bypassing it. Charles. E. Chadwick, a farmer and businessman who witnessed the next half-century of growth in Ingersoll, predicted the future belonged to immigrants from many ethnic groups who would, with the aid of Canada&#x27;s institutions, be moulded into a new people &quot;not second to any in the world.&quot;.
* James Harris (1824–1885). Owner of the factory in which was built Ingersoll&#x27;s famous Mammoth Cheese, 7,300 pounds, in 1866. Sponsorship of the venture came from a newly formed private corporation, the Ingersoll Cheese Company, whose shareholders included Harris, farmers who supplied the milk and expertise for construction of the mammoth, and businessmen. The cheese was exhibited at the New York State Fair at Saratoga in 1866, and then exported to England.
* Adam Oliver (1823–1882). Born Scotch Lake settlement, near Fredericton, NB in 1823. Moved with his family to Middlesex County, Upper Canada, in 1819. Moved to nearby Ingersoll, 1850. There he established himself as a lumberman, mill owner, contractor, and politician. Developed businesses in Orillia (1868–72) and Thunder Bay District (1872–78). Mayor of Ingersoll, 1865–66. Warden of Oxford County, 1866. MLA for the Oxford riding, 186–-75. His daughter Belle Chone Oliver (1875-1947) became a medical doctor and devoted her life to improving health care in India.

* James Noxon (1833–1906). Born Bloomfield, Prince Edward County, Upper Canada. Moved to Ingersoll, Canada West, 1856. With his brothers and his father&#x27;s financial backing, he established one of the largest manufactory of agricultural implements in the province (Noxon Company Ltd.) and the chief industry in Ingersoll. In 1878 he built a mansion which was later to become the town&#x27;s Alexandra hospital (1909). Mayor of Ingersoll, 1884–85 and 1887. As president of the firm and its largest shareholder, James lived beyond his means, running up credit and draining the company&#x27;s resources to pay the bank interest. To save the firm, his brothers ousted him in 1887. He removed to Woodstock to become plant manager of Patterson &amp; Brother, an agricultural implements firm (1887–1891) and then to Toronto, to serve as provincial Inspector of Prisons and Charities (1891–1905). Meanwhile, in Ingersoll, the Noxon Company&#x27;s Noxon-family ownership ended in 1898, the company lost its prominence of early years, and the company was shuttered in 1916.
* James McIntyre (1828-1906). Born in Scotland, moved to Canada 1841, and to Ingersoll, 1854. Cabinetmaker and undertaker, proprietor of furniture factory. But best remembered as author of some famously awful poetry, and above all for his 1866 poem, &quot;Ode on the Mammoth Cheese&quot;, a tribute to 7,300-pound cheese that local men built to advertise the Ingersoll brand.
We have seen thee, queen of cheese,Lying quietly at your ease,Gently fanned by evening breeze,Thy fair form no flies dare seize.
* Hugh McKay Sutherland (1843–1926). Born P.E.I. Moved to Oxford County, 1849. Worked for Adam Oliver as a bookkeeper in 1858 and became a partner in the Adam Oliver Company, formed 1867, Became a partner in the company&#x27;s sawmill business, 1868–72. Became Dominion Superintendent of Public Works for the Northwest Territories, 1874–78. Removed to Winnipeg where he succeeded as a promoter of railway, mining, and lumber companies. MP for Selkirk, Manitoba, 1882–87. Retired to England, where he died in 1926.
* Lt. Col. William George Wonham (1819-1887), Provincial Land Surveyor, Ingersoll. b. England 1819. Resided in Ingersoll by 1851. Drew the 1857 Tremaine Map of Oxford County. Married with four children but became a widower in 1861. Died in Winnipeg after surgery for a stomach tumour; remains buried beside wife in Ingersoll. Wonham Street in Ingersoll is named for him. During the early 1880s he left Ingersoll for the Northwest to take employment with the Dominion Department of the Interior. In 1884, in an interview with the Winnipeg Times, he described his work in the Rocky Mountains in surveying a national park [Banff] for the Dominion Government:
&quot;Some time ago I received instructions from the Department of the Interior to proceed to the Rockies and survey a park in the Cochrane Ranch Co.’s timber limit, using my own judgment as to the best location. The spot I located is about 4 miles from East Padmore and about 64 miles from Calgary in the first range of the Rockies. The scenery is grand and beautiful in the extreme, rivalling everything I have ever seen. The surface of the park, which is traversed from one end to the other by the main line of the C.P.R. is heavily timbered and contains one large lake and several smaller ones. The surface is very rocky and broken and the hills are picturesque in the extreme. As the train service does not extend past Calgary the journey west of that point has to be made by hand car. On the return journey the pumping apparatus broke, and owing to the strong wind and the track being on the downgrade we ran the car at the rate of thirteen miles per hour for seven hours by standing up and holding our coats sail fashion to catch the wind.&quot;
* Robert Stuart, (1852–1926), born in Embro, raised in Ingersoll. Robert&#x27;s extended family of origin comprised three Stuart brothers who emigrated to Canada from Banffshire, Scotland, and had businesses in Ingersoll John, a miller (1825–1899), Peter, a miller (1827–98), and Robert, a grocer (1834–1913). Robert&#x27;s father, John Stuart, operated mills in Embro and Ayr during the early 1850s. In 1858 he bought Elisha Hall&#x27;s sawmill in Ingersoll, which he converted into an oatmeal mill (named North Star Oatmeal Mills). In 1873 John sold North Star Oatmeal Mills to his brother, Peter; moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with his son, Robert; and opened a second North Star Oatmeal Mills in Cedar Rapids. In 1874 John and Robert entered into partnership with a railroader, George Douglas Sr., of Cedar Rapids. In 1876 Robert married Maggie Shearer, a niece of George Douglas. In 1877 Robert Stuart &amp; George Douglas of Cedar Rapids Iowa became co-partners with the father, John Stuart, and an Ingersoll miller, W.S. King, in founding new steam mill in Ingersoll, on north side of the River Thames. The father and son team, John and Robert, later opened a second mill in Chicago. There in 1899 Robert became a co-founder of the American Cereal Company, which was renamed the Quaker Oats Company in 1901. Robert&#x27;s progeny did well with that company. His son, Robert Douglas Stuart (1886–1975), became CEO of Quaker Oats in 1922 and served as United States ambassador to Canada from 1953 to 1956. His grandson, Robert Douglas Stuart Jr. (1916–2014), was CEO of Quaker Oats from 1966 to 1981 and served as United States Ambassador to Norway from 1984 to 1989.

The first constructed of brick in the hamlet of Ingersoll in the 1830s and the centrepiece of a large property near to what is now Royal Roads Public School (210 King Street East), this was the home of Elisha Hall (1800-1868), rival to James Ingersoll for title of first child born in village, farmer and sawmill owner, local rebel leader in the Rebellion of 1837, confidant of William Lyon Mackenzie during his exile, W.M. of local Masonic lodge, advocate for emancipation of slaves and fair treatment of local black community, and figurehead of the Reform party in Oxford for the remainder of his years. His house was demolished in 2017 without public comment, a sad example of the lack of protection for heritage properties in Ingersoll.

=== Rothwell House, 1835 ===

Located on Cemetery Lane, this was the home of Rev. John Rothwell and family, and is one of the few heritage properties for which documentation survives describing its construction, being letters written at the time to family back in Ireland by Rothwell&#x27;s wife. The Rothwells were landholders in County Meath, north of Dublin, and it may have been their promise of employment for tradesmen to construct their home which drew Edward Comiskey, a carpenter from their hometown who later had a hand in the construction of the first St. James Anglican Church.

=== Elm Hurst ===
Now the hub of the Elm Hurst Inn and Spa (Harris Street at 401), this was the home of James Harris (1824-1885), who operated the Maple Leaf Cheese Factory on the same property, where the world-famous Mammoth Cheese was manufactured in 1866.

=== Christopher Brothers Residences ===
Building contractors and operators of a steam saw mill and lumber export business in Ingersoll&#x27;s boom years in the 1860s and 1870s, the four Christopher brothers built palatial residences for themselves, each distinguished with a central tower. Two still stand - one serves as the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 119 (211 Thames Street North) and the other as Oxford Manor (276 Oxford Street). The two which have been lost to the wrecker&#x27;s hammer were nearby the Legion property on Thames Street North.

=== Norsworthy House ===
Norsworthy House (250 King St. E.) was home to the family of James Counter Norsworthy (1846–1936). James, native of Devonshire, England, had moved to the Thamesford area in 1852, entered the insurance business, and in 1876 removed to Ingersoll, where he became an inspector for the North British Mercantile Insurance Co. Norsworthy acquired his house in 1878, as part of a dowry from his marriage to Mary Jane Cuthbert (1853–91). James had four sons and a daughter by his first wife, Mary Jane. After her death in 1891, at the age of 38, he remarried to Mrs. John T. MacDonald of Sarnia in 1895.

Today, the Norsworthy family is known for its family home, a stately Victorian mansion. styled &quot;Norleigh.&quot; James enlarged the house to add an office and a separate entrance for clients and a large front porch; and he added ornate features such as stained glass windows and finely-carved fireplaces, and an upper-story tank to supply the house with water in a gravity system.

The family is remembered for its outstanding contribution to Canada&#x27;s war effort during the First World War. All four Norsworthy sons enlisted as officers, and two of them, Edward and Fred, were killed in action. After the loss of his sons, J.C. Norsworthy became an expert historian on the war and travelled extensively to speak on the subject.

The house is rumoured to be haunted by the ghost of Norsworthy&#x27;s first wife, Mary Jane, who died in 1891 after nursing her children back to health from diphtherias. Perhaps the ghostly Mary Jane&#x27;s target was the second wife, the replacement mother for her children. That said, the current owners have never seen the Lady in Grey or anything else that could be considered ghostly. Neither have any of the guests who have stayed with them through the bed and breakfast they operate.

== Natural areas and parks ==

=== Victoria Park ===
Ingersoll&#x27;s first park, established in 1869. It was known as the Town Park until 1882 when, on the occasion of the town&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Birthday Celebration, it was named Victoria.
This park lies adjacent to Centennial Park and is home to the Victoria Park Community Recreation Centre.

=== Soldiers&#x27; Carroll Memorial Park ===
Ingersoll&#x27;s second oldest park and, unlike Victoria Park, located near the centre of the town (north of Canterbury Street and east of Thames Street). Formerly the site of Partlo&#x27;s mill pond. The town established Soldiers&#x27; Carroll Memorial Park in 1919, using a bequest from Dr. D.W. Carroll (1838–1912), by purchasing and draining of Partlo&#x27;s mill pond. Hall&#x27;s Creek, which formerly flowed into the pond, continued, but its course was changed and widened; rustic bridges were erected and other improvements made, including the installation of a swimming pool for children. Also about 1920, the Lady Dufferin Chapter, Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire, erected a Park Cenotaph to honour Ingersoll men who gave their lives and served the Empire in two World Wars and the Korean War. Thus, many townspeople have referred to Carroll&#x27;s Park as Memorial Park. In 2006 a Town by-law renamed Memorial Park honour of Yvonne Holmes Mott (1934-2005) for &quot;outstanding contributions to the Town and its people over her lifetime.&quot;

Each July the Park serves as the main venue for the annual Canterbury Folk Festival, with the main stages, seating area, beverage tents, and craft vendors located there.

=== Centennial Park ===
This eight-acre park was created as a Canada Centennial project in 1967. The Ingersoll Cheese Factory Museum and the Creative Arts Centre are located at the upstream end of the former Stuart&#x27;s Millpond (1822-1909). Centennial is a long and narrow, grass-lined park with a variety of young and older trees. There is a small cheese-themed playground with benches and a walking bridge over a small babbling brook. The playground and benches are constructed of natural wood and bright yellow &#x27;cheese slices&#x27;. The backs of the benches look like pieces of Swiss Cheese with the requisite holes. Camping is allowed in the summer with basic toilet facilities at a cost of $15.00 per night. In the winter, there is a charming display of lights that runs the length of the park from the entrance on Harris Street to the exit on Wellington Street.

=== John Lawson Park and Trail ===
Located along the south bank of the Thames River, this park contains walking trails in a natural area. Accessed from Charles St. West, at the bottom of Wonham St. South.

=== Smith&#x27;s Pond Park ===
This park is a natural area with walking trails, tall grass, and an annual fishing derby. Its location on the south side of Canterbury Street is the former site of Smith&#x27;s mill pond. This pond vanished on 5 March 1976 when its swollen waters broke through the embankment supporting Smith&#x27;s dam. The park was established in 2000. The park includes the ruins of the old cement dam and a new, much smaller pond, created by splitting the flow of Hall&#x27;s Creek. One fork of the creek runs through the pond, the other fork alongside it.

=== 19th-century millponds ===
Early mills required water power, which was obtained by damming steams to create millponds and mill races. Thus, Ingersoll&#x27;s first pond most likely dated from the years 1818-1819, when Thomas Ingersoll Jr. and James Ingersoll built a saw mill on the family farm, fulfilling their father&#x27;s vision when he chose the site for his family in 1793. Construction of a dam, spillway, raceway and millwheel machinery and structures was a complex process, but the saw mill was finally put into operation by April 1819. This was followed by construction of a grist mill as the family ventures grew. By the 1850s Ingersoll had five ponds whose mill races delivered power to grist mills, flour mills, saw mills and a woollen mill. All five ponds were located south of the River Thames, four of them using water from two north-flowing tributaries of the Thames River and one using water from the Thames itself. Three mill ponds were located along Hall&#x27;s Creek, which flowed swiftly northward from Elisha Hall&#x27;s farm: Hall&#x27;s Pond (later Stuart&#x27;s Pond), Smith&#x27;s Pond, and Smith&#x27;s &quot;lower pond&quot; (later Partlo&#x27;s Pond). To the west was Benson&#x27;s Pond (later King&#x27;s Pond) on Whiting Creek. Lastly, there was Carroll&#x27;s pond, just south of the River Thames. To make this pond, Daniel Carroll diverted water from the west-flowing Thames to create an artificial, west-flowing creek; then he damned the creek to create the pond and mill race, which delivered power to two grist mills; the outflow of water from these mills returned the creek water to the River Thames.The last of the ponds, Smith&#x27;s Pond, came to an end in 1976.

The advent of steam power in the 1850s freed industries from dependence on water power and proximity to mill ponds. This allowed new industries to locate on the north side of the Thames and other hitherto neglected places.

== Historical churches ==

From the earliest days, the people of the Oxford settlement were drawn to evangelicals and evangelism. The families brought in by Thomas Ingersoll were active in an era when Puritanism (Congregational Church) was still the official religion in most of New England, and a great many could not abide the extreme self-denial preached by such men as the pastor at Great Barrington, one of many who have been described by historians as &quot;Puritans gone haywire&quot;. The Anglican, Methodist and Baptist forms of worship had become popular alternatives. Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s associate, Rev. Gideon Bostwick was so popular that the people of Great Barrington refused to make any further payments to support the Congregational pastor, although required by law. Bostwick&#x27;s missionary circuit from Great Barrington grew to include parts of Vermont, Connecticut, New York state, and the whole western end of Massachusetts. In his journeys he preached in the same frontier towns as Baptist and Methodist missionaries. After Bostwick&#x27;s unexpected death in 1793, at least five Baptist preachers were amongst the Thomas Ingersoll settlers, and Methodist missionaries won the hearts of two of Ingersoll&#x27;s daughters. All of the churches established in the hamlet of Ingersoll had their origin in such missionary work. As the community grew, it raised its own missionaries who went out into the wider world, including the first mayor&#x27;s daughter Dr. Belle Chone Oliver, and most famous of all, Aimee Semple McPherson.

=== First Baptist Church ===
Without any resident clergy, the Oxford settlement relied on visiting missionaries for spiritual guidance in its earliest years. Amongst the first of these to make the journey were sent by Baptist associations in the state of Vermont, where families such as the Canfields and Burdicks, who were headed by Baptist preachers, had spent time before their move to Canada in the 1790s. Members of the first Baptist congregations joined in covenants to watch over each other. By the 1850s there were several such separate congregations in the Ingersoll area. A Baptist Meeting House opened &quot;on the side of a hill in Albert Street, near the English [Anglican] Church&quot; in June, 1858. This came from ongoing efforts to unite the separate congregations, which continued for the next four decades under pastors such as the Rev. John Dempsey(1822-1899). A graduate of the first Baptist College in Canada which operated in Montreal in the 1840s, Dempsey was appointed pastor in several communities in Quebec and Ontario (including Ingersoll) during his career, and after retiring to Ingersoll, he continued with efforts to develop a Baptist College in Oxford, at Woodstock (later moved to Toronto, then to Hamilton, as the nucleus of today&#x27;s McMaster University). The fully united congregation in Ingersoll constructed a red brick church building in 1896, on what is now the northeast corner of Thames Street South and Canterbury Street. This building was destroyed by fire following a lightning strike in 1898, but was immediately re-built on the existing site. It is still an active, community-oriented, Christian Church.

=== British Methodist Episcopal Church ===
During the 1850s and 1860s a congregation of escaped slaves from the American south grew up in Ingersoll who were served by this church, which owned a building on Catherine Street from about 1860 to 1900. Its most famous pastor was the Rev. Solomon Peter Hale (1815–1903), whose flamboyant sermons drew the attention of newspapers in the area.

=== Ingersoll Christian Reformed Church ===
The church&#x27;s original congregation came from the Netherlands in the mid-1850s. In 1955, a barn was renovated into a church on King Street. In 1973 the barn was sold and later burned in 1975. In 1976, the congregation decided to rebuild on 1.6 ha (4 ac) just west of the first church.

=== Peoples Revival Centre ===
In 1942, the congregation bought the collegiate gym and moved the complex to its present location.

=== Princess Elizabeth Community Centre ===
In 2012, Princess Elizabeth Public School was purchased by a charity named the Vedic Institute of Canada and has been converted to Vedic ashram or retreat centre.

=== Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church ===
The congregation was established in 1838, served by missionaries. The first church, a wooden building, was built on John Street in 1850. It was raised to parish status in 1864. The brick church building on the corner of Thames Street North and Bell Street was built in 1879, it is one of the tallest structures in the town, and its interior contains numerous oil paintings and large stained-glass windows.

=== Salvation Army ===
The congregation was established in 1884 and the church was built in 1935.

=== St. James Anglican Church ===

On granting the township of Oxford-on-the-Thames to Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s associates in 1793, Governor Simcoe had hoped the new settlement would be led by the Rev. Gideon Bostwick (1742–1793), who had been ordained by the Bishop of London at St. James Palace in 1770 and by 1793 had a large and well-known missionary circuit extending many miles north, south and east from St. James Episcopal (Anglican) Church in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. (He had presided over each of Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s marriages there). Bostwick was named first amongst Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s associates, and his &quot;well known suffering&quot; for the church caused Simcoe to note him just the type who should be encouraged to settle here. Bostwick made strenuous preparations for the move but died suddenly from pneumonia before seeing his new home in Upper Canada. His sons and daughters made the move a few years later, and son Henry Bostwick (1782–1816) was appointed by Isaac Brock to command the Oxford Militia in the War of 1812. The Oxford settlement later hamlet of Ingersoll did not have a resident Anglican priest until 40 years after Gideon&#x27;s death, although it was included on the bishop&#x27;s occasional circuits through the province until then. The congregation was formally established in 1834 with the arrival of the Rev. John Rothwell (1797–1866), ordained following his graduation from Trinity College, Dublin. Rather than appointed by the bishop, Rothwell himself chose the hamlet of Ingersoll as his new home, purchasing farm land for his family and volunteering his services for the first five years without asking compensation, encouraging the congregation to concentrate instead on building a suitable first church for the community, using land donated by the Ingersolls on its highest hill (now the site of the senior citizens apartment building on Earl Street), finally completed and consecrated in 1840. The present church building on Oxford Street near the town hall was erected in 1868. The contractors were the Christopher Brothers.

=== St. Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church ===
The congregation was established in 1846. It was originally named Knox Presbyterian until the union of a number of parishes – Knox, Erskine and St. Andrews – at what became St. Paul&#x27;s in 1889. A fascinating description (available online) of the early days of the Knox congregation and the interplay between the Presbyterians, Baptists, Methodists and Anglicans in Ingersoll in the 1840s and 1850s was written by the son of the first pastor of Knox Church, Rev. Robert Wallace (1820–1897). The Presbyterian church sometimes drew followers who could not abide the &quot;ranters&quot; presiding at the other churches.

=== Trinity United Church ===
The United Church was formed in 1925 to complete the national movement underway for decades to unite Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregationalist churches across Canada. The Methodists were originally reformers in the Church of England (Anglican Church) in the 1700s who formed their own church movement when reforms were rejected. The earliest Methodist missionaries to the Oxford settlement came with permission from Thomas Ingersoll, who mourned the loss of Gideon Bostwick&#x27;s evangelical powers, but saw the need for other forms of spiritual leadership. Two of his daughters eventually married Methodist missionaries. As the hamlet of Ingersoll grew in the 1820s, Methodists used the log schoolhouse on Oxford Street for worship, and shared it with the Anglicans when Rev. John Rothwell arrived in 1834. Two branches of the Methodists developed in the hamlet, each with its own church building by the 1850s (Episcopal Methodists on Charles Street at the foot of Oxford Street, and Wesleyan Methodists on Oxford Street across from the Town Hall). The original &quot;Two Tower&quot; church on King Street West was built in 1865 for the Wesleyans. With expansions over the years, it eventually became the home of both Methodist congregations along with some of the Presbyterians in the town. The three-portal entranceway that was added to it and the name Trinity were symbolic of the union.

== Sports history ==
=== Baseball ===
The New England settlers of Oxford-on-the-Thames brought with them an early version of the stick and ball game now known as baseball. This was played in the Great Barrington area in the 1790s, and was a part of the Queen&#x27;s Birthday celebrations in pioneer Oxford, as immortalized in the writings of Dr. Ford which gave nearby Beachville its fame as the birthplace of baseball in Canada. By the 1860s a Canadian championship circuit had been developed from Oxford. Ingersoll&#x27;s team took the title in 1868 and went on to display its prowess in matches against American teams in the 1870s. By the 1930s Ingersoll had a semi-pro team that recruited Oscar &#x27;Lefty&#x27; Judd (1908–1995), a phenomenal pitcher from Nissouri township who helped propel the team to the provincial championship before launching his career as a professional player in the United States.

=== Hockey ===
The greatest year for organized hockey in Oxford was arguably the 1954-55 season, when Woodstock&#x27;s Warriors recruited the sensational young Bobby Hull for its Junior B team and went on to win the provincial championship. The energy was infectious. Bobby was known to hang out at the pool hall in downtown Ingersoll and players in town as well as in Tillsonburg got stoked, carrying their own teams to new heights. Ingersoll&#x27;s Reems captured the Junior C provincial championship that same year, while Tillsonburg topped the Intermediate A ranks.

=== Cycling ===

When bicycling exploded in popularity in the 1890s, the sign of prowess was to complete a &#x27;century&#x27; during free time on the weekend, meaning completion of at least 100 miles of travel. The town&#x27;s undisputed all-time great was Doug Carr (1910-1994), who made a round-the-world bicycle tour of over 60,000 miles from 1937 to 1939, followed by a speaking tour celebrating the feat, before settling into his career as a book and china store operator in Ingersoll. The physical artifacts he saved are housed at the Ingersoll Cheese and Agricultural Museum; his diaries, photographs and papers from his years of adventure are at the Ontario Archives. An online archive has been created from a presentation at the HASTAC 2013 conference at York University, Toronto, and numerous other online summaries are available.

=== School athletics ===

Through much of the last century, the elementary schools in Ingersoll joined each year in presenting a May Festival program of dancing and singing for entertainment of parents at the town arena, and a Field Day program when all the schools paraded to Victoria Park for a day of athletic competitions on the playing fields in front of the covered grandstands. At the high school level, the school boards collaborated in organizing competitions between teams from all the high schools in the county. In 1958 this was expanded to create tri-county athletics championship competitions amongst the high schools of Oxford, Elgin and Norfolk counties, as a preliminary to determining entry in the Western Ontario Secondary School Athletics Association (WOSSAA) championship. When the school boards were merged to form the current Thames Valley District School Board in 1998, the tri-county competition was modified to include Oxford, Elgin and Middlesex as the championship series preliminary to WOSSAA. Ingersoll earned its first tri-county championship in football with a string of IDCI Blue Bombers senior team victories in 1968. The IDCI girls hockey team has reached the WOSSAA championship level three years in a row as of 2018. Rankings, standings and championship holders are all provided on the Thames Valley Regional Athletics website.

== Plaques and monuments ==
=== The Big Cheese ===
Located south of Ingersoll, at the Elm Hurst Inn, off Road 119, the first exit north of Highway 401 has a plaque that marks the site of James Harris&#x27;s co-operative cheese factory, in which was constructed a giant 7,300-pound &quot;Big Cheese.&quot; The mammoth cheddar was made in eight days and cured in three months in a specially-built shed. In August 1866, the &quot;Big Cheese&quot; was transported on a modified wagon by six horses to the train station in Ingersoll. It was exhibited at the New York State Fair in Saratoga and then shipped to England, where it was bought by a Liverpool merchant.

=== First cheese factory ===
Located at the Ingersoll Post Office, a historical plaque commemorates the establishment of the first cheese factory in Canada near the Oxford County village of Norwich in 1864. The rapid, widespread adoption of the co-operative factory system across Ontario marked the beginning of the modern dairy industry in Canada. The Canadian Dairymen&#x27;s Association was founded in Ingersoll in 1867.

=== Founders of Ingersoll ===
Located on the south east corner of the Thames Street bridge. Commemorates Major Thomas Ingersoll and his son Charles who were responsible for the first major settlement of the Townships of East, West and North Oxford and who founded the community of Ingersoll in 1793.

=== Site of Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s log cabin ===
This plaque, situated on a pavilion, marks the former location of Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s log cabin, circa 1795. Located between 131 and 147 Thames Street, Ingersoll.

=== The old town halls and the present-day one ===

The original market house and town hall, constructed of wood in 1853 on the southeast corner of King and Oxford streets, was destroyed by fire in April 1856. The village council replaced it with a brick building in 1857, at a cost of £2,700, and paid £8 15s to have its image displayed on Tremaine&#x27;s 1857 Map of Oxford County. The town demolished that building in 1990 and replaced it with the present-day town hall, on the southwest corner of King and Oxford streets. A Saturday-morning farmer&#x27;s market operates seasonally on the town hall square, situated on original site of the town hall. An historical plaque marking the second building vanished with its demolition.

<text>Ê, ê (e-circumflex) is a letter of the Latin alphabet, found in Afrikaans, French, Friulian, Kurdish, Norwegian (Nynorsk), Portuguese, Vietnamese, and Welsh. It is used to transliterate Chinese, Persian, and Ukrainian and presents an open mid-back unrounded pharynhotic vowel.

==Usage in various languages==

===Afrikaans===
Ê is not considered a separate letter in Afrikaans but a variation of &quot;E&quot;. The circumflex changes the pronunciation of &quot;e&quot; to be (or if the succeeding consonant is either a dorsal or a liquid)

===Chinese===
In the Pinyin romanization of Standard Mandarin Chinese, &quot;ê&quot; represents . It corresponds to Zhuyin ㄝ. The circumflex occurs only if &quot;ê&quot; is the only vowel in a syllable: &quot;ề&quot; (; &quot;eh!&quot;). Without the circumflex, &quot;e&quot; as the only vowel represents : &quot;è&quot; (; &quot;hungry&quot;). Elsewhere, is written as &quot;a&quot; (after &quot;i&quot; or &quot;ü&quot; before &quot;n&quot;) or &quot;e&quot; (before or after another vowel), with the appropriate tone mark,: &quot;xiān&quot; (; &quot;first&quot;), &quot;xuǎn&quot; (; &quot;to choose&quot;, noting that &quot;ü&quot; is written &quot;u&quot; after &quot;x&quot;), &quot;xué&quot; (; &quot;to learn&quot;), &quot;xièxie&quot; (; &quot;thanks&quot;).

In Pe̍h-ōe-jī, &quot;ê&quot; is the fifth tone of &quot;e&quot;: &quot;ê&quot; (; possessive, adjectival suffix).

===French===
Diacritics are not considered to be distinct letters of the French alphabet. In French, ê usually changes the pronunciation of &quot;e&quot; from /ə/ to /ɛ/. It is used instead of &quot;è&quot; for words that used to be written &quot;es&quot;.

===Friulian===
Ê represents and .

===Khmer===
Ê is used in UNGEGN romanization system for Khmer to represent and , for example &quot;Khmêr&quot; ( ) and Dângrêk Mountains ( ).

===Kurdish===
Ê is the 7th letter of the Kurdish Kurmanji alphabet and represents /eː/.

=== Norwegian Nynorsk ===
In Nynorsk, &quot;ê&quot; is used to represent the reduction of the Old Norse sequence , similar to the use of &quot;ê&quot; for the historical sequence in French. It is mostly used to differentiate words which otherwise would be spelled the same, e.g. &quot;vêr&quot; &#x27;weather&#x27; and &quot;ver&quot;, imperative of &#x27;to be&#x27;.

===Persian===
Ê is used in the Persian Latin (Rumi) alphabet, equivalent to ع.

===Portuguese===
In Portuguese, ê marks a stressed only in words whose stressed syllable is in an otherwise unpredictable location in the word: &quot;pêssego&quot; (peach). The letter, pronounced , can also contrast with é, pronounced , as in &quot;pé&quot; (foot).

In Brazilian Portuguese, ê also used on final syllable of the root word e.g. (&quot;Guinea-Bissau&quot;).

===Tibetan===
Ê is used in Tibetan pinyin to represent , for example Gêrzê County.

===Ukrainian===
Ê is used in the ISO 9:1995 system of Ukrainian transliteration as the letter Є.

===Vietnamese===
Ê is the 9th letter of the Vietnamese alphabet and represents . In Vietnamese phonology, diacritics can be added to form five forms to represent five tones of ê:

* Ề ề
* Ể ể
* Ễ ễ
* Ế ế
* Ệ ệ

===Welsh===
In Welsh, &quot;ê&quot; represents long stressed &quot;e&quot; if the vowel would otherwise be pronounced as short : &quot;llên&quot; &quot;literature&quot;, as opposed to &quot;llen&quot; &quot;curtain&quot;, or &quot;gêm&quot; &quot;game&quot;, as opposed to &quot;gem&quot; &quot;gem, jewel&quot;. That is useful for borrowed words with a final stress like &quot;apêl&quot; &quot;appeal&quot;.

===Other===
In Popido, a fictitious dialect of Esperanto made by Manuel Halvelik for use in literature, &quot;ê&quot; represents . It is only used epenthetically to break consonant clusters, especially before grammatical suffixes.

==Character mappings==
Unicode encoded 5 pairs of precomposed characters (Ề / ề, Ể / ể, Ễ / ễ, Ế / ế, Ệ / ệ) for the five tones of ê in Vietnamese. Two pairs of the five (Ế / ế and Ề / ề) can also be used as the second and fourth tones of ê in Pinyin. The first and third tones of ê in Pinyin have to be represented by combining diacritical marks, like ê̄ (ê&amp;#772;) and ê̌ (ê&amp;#780;).

<text>Ë, ë (e-diaeresis) is a letter in the Albanian, Kashubian, Emilian, Romagnol, Ladin, and Lenape alphabets. As a variant of the letter &quot;e&quot;, it also appears in Acehnese, Afrikaans, Belarusian, Breton, Dutch, English, Filipino, French, Luxembourgish, Piedmontese, Russian, the Abruzzese dialect of the Neapolitan language, and the Ascolano dialect. The letter is also used in Seneca, Taiwanese Hokkien, Turoyo, and Uyghur when written in Latin script.

==Usage in various languages==
===Acehnese===
In Acehnese, &quot;ë&quot; is used to represent (schwa), a mid central vowel.

===Afrikaans===
In Afrikaans, the trema (Afrikaans: &quot;deelteken&quot;, ) is used mostly to indicate that two vowels are pronounced separately. The &quot;deelteken&quot; does exactly what it means in Afrikaans (&quot;separation mark&quot;) by marking the beginning of a new syllable and by separating it from the previous one. For example, &quot;geëet&quot; (&quot;eaten&quot;) is pronounced in two syllables, the second one beginning with &quot;ë.&quot;

The &quot;deelteken&quot; does not always influence the number of syllables. The word &quot;voël&quot; (&quot;bird&quot;), pronounced , is different from &quot;voel&quot; (&quot;feel&quot;), pronounced , but both words have one syllable. In other cases, the &quot;deelteken&quot; does not even change the pronunciation. The words &quot;geër&quot; (&quot;giver&quot;) and &quot;geer&quot; (a wedge-shaped piece of fabric), for instance, are both pronounced in contemporary language. Historically, though, words like &quot;geër&quot; or &quot;reën&quot; (&quot;rain&quot;) were pronounced in two syllables: &quot;reën,&quot; which nowadays is pronounced , was pronounced as in older Afrikaans. The &quot;deelteken&quot; is only etymological since the archaic form of &quot;reën&quot; is &quot;regen.&quot;

===Albanian===
&quot;Ë&quot; is the 8th letter of the Albanian alphabet and represents the vowel , like the pronunciation of the in &quot;ago&quot;. It is the fourth most commonly used letter of the language, comprising 7.74 percent of all writings. According to other data, it is the most common letter, comprising 10.290% of writings.

===Armenian===
&quot;Ë&quot; is used in the romanization of Classical or Eastern Armenian to represent the letter (ët’).

===Ascolano===
&quot;Ë&quot; is a phonetic symbol also used in the transcription of Abruzzese dialects and in the Province of Ascoli Piceno (the Ascolano dialect). It is called &quot;mute E&quot; and sounds like a hummed &quot;é&quot;. It is important for the prosody of the dialect itself.

===Dutch===
In Dutch, &quot;ë&quot; appears in the plural form of most words that end in &quot;-ie&quot; or &quot;-ee&quot;, like &quot;kolonie&quot; -&gt; &quot;koloniën&quot;, &quot;zee&quot; -&gt; &quot;zeeën&quot;, and &quot;knie&quot; -&gt; &quot;knieën&quot; (Dutch-language rules stipulate an extra &quot;e&quot; before the &quot;ë&quot; in plurals if the accent falls on the syllable containing the &quot;ë&quot;). This so-called trema indicates that the vowel letter does not form a digraph with the preceding vowel letter but is pronounced separately. For example, &quot;koloniën&quot; is pronounced , but &quot;kolonien&quot; would be pronounced *.

=== Emilian ===
In some peripheral Emilian dialects, ë is used to represent [ə], e.g. &quot;strëtt&quot; [strətː] &quot;narrow&quot;.

===English===
Use of the character &quot;Ë&quot; in the English language is relatively rare. Some publications, such as the American magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, use it more often than others. It is used to indicate that the &quot;e&quot; is to be pronounced separately from the preceding vowel (e.g. in the word &quot;reëntry&quot;, the feminine name &quot;Chloë&quot; or in the masculine name &quot;Raphaël&quot;), or at all – like in the name of the Brontë sisters, where without diaeresis the final &quot;e&quot; would be mute.

===Filipino===
 In the Filipino language (Filipíno/Filipino) of 1987 to the present, and even in its de facto and its predecessor&#x27;s or predecessors&#x27; de jure language basis (of the former Pilipino language from 1959 to 1987 and of the much former Pilipino or Filipino National Language, Pilipino or Filipino Tagalog-based National Language, Pilipino or Filipino Tagalog-based Language, Tagalog-based National Language, Tagalog-based Language and/or (the) National Language from 1937 to 1959), which is the Tagalog language (Tagálog/Tagalog), Ë or ë, only since 2013, represents the schwa vowel sound natively existing in few to some Filipino words from Maranao (Mëranáw/Mëranaw), Pangasinan (Panggasinán/Pangasinan), and Ilocano (Ilokáno/Ilokano) languages that are also words in Filipino, among few to some other Filipino words from the other languages in the Philippines that natively have this vowel sound (e.g. Karay-a (Karáy-a/Kinaray-a), Cuyonon (Kuyónon/Kuyonon), Kankanaey (Kankanáëy/Kankanay), and Ibaloi (Ibalóy/Ibaloy) languages) and that are also words in Filipino.

Before the introduction of this variant of the letter &quot;Ee&quot; in the Filipino language&#x27;s orthography, the schwa vowel sound was ambiguously represented by either the letter &quot;A&quot; / &quot;a&quot; or &quot;E&quot; / &quot;e&quot;. 

===Finnic===
&quot;Ë&quot; is used in the linguistic reconstructions of Proto-Finnic to denote an unrounded (mid?) back vowel [ɤ~ɤ̞~ʌ] the back counterpart to [e] for Proto-Finnic&#x27;s system of vowel harmony. It is also used in the allophonic diphthong [ɤu] – &quot;ëu&quot;.

===French===
&quot;Ë&quot; appears in words like French &quot;Noël&quot;. Like in Dutch, it is used to indicate that the vowel letter does not form a digraph with the preceding vowel letter but is pronounced separately. For example, &quot;Noël&quot; is pronounced , whilst &quot;Noel&quot; would be pronounced .

===German===

&quot;Ë&quot; does not occur in the &quot;official&quot; German alphabet. However, a diaeresis above e in German occurs in a few proper names and ethnonyms, such as Ferdinand Piëch, Bernhard Hoëcker, Alëuten, Niuë, Uëa. Occasionally, a diaeresis may be used in some well-known names, such as Italiën, which is usually written as &quot;Italien&quot;. Without a diaeresis, &quot;ie&quot; would be [iː] instead of [iə]; &quot;eu&quot; would be [ɔʏ] instead of [eu] and &quot;ae&quot;, &quot;oe&quot;, &quot;ue&quot; would be alternative representations of respectively ä, ö, ü.

===Hungarian===
&quot;Ë&quot; does not belong to the &quot;official&quot; Hungarian alphabet, but is usually applied in folklore notations and sometimes also in stylistic writing, e.g. is extensively used in the vocal oeuvre of Kodály. The reason is that open &quot;e&quot; (close to English hat, cat, cap) and closed &quot;ë&quot; (close to Spanish e) are distinguished in most spoken dialects, but is not indicated in writing because of the history of writing and due to little but observable areal variation.

===Kashubian===
&quot;Ë&quot; is the 9th letter of the Kashubian alphabet and represents .

===Ladin===
Although not used in standard Ladin, &quot;Ë&quot; is used in the local variations &quot;gherdëina&quot;, &quot;badiot&quot; and &quot;fodom&quot;. It represents .

===Latin===
In many editions of Latin texts, the diaeresis is used to indicate that &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; form a hiatus, not a diphthong (in the Classical pronunciation) or a monophthong (in traditional English pronunciations). Examples: &quot;aër&quot; &quot;air&quot;, &quot;poëta&quot; &quot;poet&quot;, &quot;coërcere&quot; &quot;to coerce&quot;.

===Lenape===
In the Lenape language, the letter ë is used to represent the schwa vowel. An example of its use is the word &quot;mikwën&quot;, which means &quot;feather&quot;. It can also be found in more complex words, such as &quot;ntëmpëm&quot;, which means &quot;my brain&quot;.

===Luxembourgish===
In Luxembourgish, &quot;ë&quot; is used to indicate stressed schwa as in the word &quot;ëmmer&quot; [ˈəmɐ] (&quot;always&quot;). Otherwise, a stressed &quot;e&quot; is pronounced as [æ] (e.g. &quot;sechs&quot; [zæks] (&quot;six&quot;)), [ɛ] (e.g. &quot;Verb&quot; [vɛχp] (&quot;verb&quot;)) or [eː] (e.g. &quot;Prefix&quot; [ˈpʀeːfiks] (&quot;prefix&quot;)).

It is also used to indicate an unstressed schwa in the following cases:

1. Before or after a double &quot;ee&quot;, pronounced [eː], to indicate that the &quot;ë&quot; does not form a digraph with the preceding or following vowel letter but is pronounced separately, for example: &quot;gëeegent&quot; [ɡəˈʔeːʑənt] (&quot;suitable&quot;), &quot;Eeër&quot; [ˈeːɐ] (&quot;eggs&quot;) or &quot;leeën&quot; [ˈleːən] (&quot;to lay&quot;). This also applies to French loanwords ending in &quot;-ée&quot;, e.g. &quot;Musée&quot; [ˈmyːzeː] (&quot;museum&quot;), &quot;n&quot;-plural: &quot;Muséeën&quot; [ˈmyːzeːən]&quot;, n&quot;-less plural: &quot;Muséeë&quot; [ˈmyːzeːə]. About usage of plural forms with and without &quot;-n&quot;, see Eifeler Regel.

2. To indicate that the word-final &quot;-e&quot; is pronounced in the &quot;n&quot;-less plural form of words whose singular ends in a mute &quot;-e&quot;, e.g. &quot;Orange&quot; [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃ] (&quot;orange&quot;, singular), &quot;Orangen&quot; [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃən] (plural with &quot;-n&quot;), &quot;Orangë&quot; [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃə] (plural without &quot;-n&quot;).

3. In feminine nouns with a word-final mute &quot;-e&quot; denoting a female person, an extra &quot;ë&quot; is added in the plural to distinguish it from the plural of the corresponding masculine noun:

* &quot;Cliente&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːt] (&quot;customer&quot; [female], feminine, singular), &quot;Clienteën&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːtən] (plural with &quot;-n&quot;), &quot;Clienteë&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːtə] (plural without &quot;-n&quot;) vs.
* &quot;Client&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ː] (&quot;customer&quot; [male or gender-neutral], masculine, singular), &quot;Clienten&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːən] (plural with &quot;-n&quot;), &quot;Clientë&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːə] (plural without &quot;-n&quot;).

4. In the corresponding masculine nouns the diaeresis is used in the &quot;n&quot;-less plural form to distinguish it from the singular of the corresponding feminine noun: &quot;Clientë&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːə] (&quot;customers&quot; [male or gender-neutral], masculine, plural without &quot;-n&quot;) vs. &quot;Cliente&quot; [ˈkliɑ̃ːt] (&quot;customer&quot; [female], feminine, singular).

===Mayan languages===
In the modern orthography of Mayan languages, the letter &quot;Ë&quot; represents .

===Piedmontese===
&quot;Ë&quot; represents the mid central vowel in the modern orthography of Piedmontese language.

===Quenya===
In constructed language Quenya diaeresis indicates that a vowel is not part of a diphthong, for example in &quot;ëa&quot; or &quot;ëo&quot;, while final &quot;ë&quot; is marked with a diaeresis to remind English-speakers that it is not silent.

===Romagnol===
Ë is used in Romagnol to represent [ɛː~ɛə], e.g. &quot;fradël&quot; [fraˈdɛəl~fraˈdɛːl] &quot;brother&quot;.

===Russian===
In some Latin transliterations of Russian such as ISO 9, &quot;ë&quot; is used for its homoglyph &quot;ё&quot;, representing a , as in &quot;Potëmkin&quot; to render the Cyrillic &quot;Потёмкин&quot;. Other translations use &quot;yo&quot;, &quot;jo&quot; or (ambiguously) simply &quot;e&quot;.

===Syriac===
In the romanization of Syriac, the letter &quot;Ë&quot; gives a schwa. In some grammatical constructions, it is a replacement for the other, original vowels (a, o, e, i, u). Example words that have &quot;Ë&quot;: &quot;knoṭër&quot; (&quot;he is waiting&quot;), &quot;krëhṭi&quot; (&quot;they are running&quot;), &quot;krëqdo&quot; (&quot;she is dancing&quot;), &quot;ŝërla&quot; (&quot;she has closed&quot;), &quot;gfolëḥ&quot; (&quot;he will work&quot;), &quot;madënḥo&quot; (&quot;east&quot;), &quot;mën&quot; (&quot;what&quot;), &quot;ašër&quot; (&quot;believe&quot;). Turoyo and Assyrian languages may utilize this diacritic, albeit rarely.

===Seneca===
In Seneca, the letter &quot;Ë&quot; is used to represent , a close-mid front unrounded nasalized vowel.

===Tagalog===
In the Tagalog language and in and from its de facto standardized form of or as the Filipino language, &quot;Ë&quot; or &quot;ë&quot;, only since 2013, is used to represent the schwa vowel sound, particularly in non-native Tagalog loanwords from the other languages of the Philippines and, specifically and especially in the case of Tagalog, from or through either themselves or Filipino, or both, such as from Maranao (Mëranaw), Pangasinan (Panggasinan/Pangasinan), Ilocano (Ilokano), Karay-a (Karay-a/Kinaray-a), Cuyonon (Kuyonon), Kankanaey (Kankanaëy/Kankanay), and Ibaloi (Ibaloy). 

Before the introduction of this letter &quot;Ee&quot; variant of and from Filipino&#x27;s orthography, the schwa vowel sound was ambiguously represented by either the letter &quot;A&quot; / &quot;a&quot; or &quot;E&quot; / &quot;e&quot; in Tagalog.

===Uyghur===
&quot;Ë&quot; is the 6th letter of the Uyghur Latin alphabet and represents close-mid front unrounded vowel (while plain &quot;E&quot; stands for or ).

<text>The Remarkables () are a mountain range and part of the Remarkables Conservation Area that includes Kawarau/The Remarkables and Tāpuae O’Uenuku/Hector Mountains and Te Papapuni/Nevis River valley. Located on the southeastern shore of Lake Wakatipu, Otago in the South Island of New Zealand, the range lives up to its name by rising sharply to create a remarkable backdrop. The range is clearly visible from the nearby town of Queenstown.

The highest point in the range is Single Cone (2319 metres). The adjacent Tapuae-o-Uenuku / Hector Mountains southeast of the Remarkables culminate in Mount Tūwhakarōria (2307 m).

The area contains a number of beautiful features, such as Lake Alta, a small lake nestled within a natural amphitheatre at the head of a glacial valley (a ‘cirque’) and below the towering Double Cone peaks. There are a number of high altitude walks in the Remarkables Conservation Area including Lake Alta which can be accessed from the Remarkables Skifield. 

==Name==
The original Ngāi Tahu inhabitants called the mountains , and gave the same name to the Kawarau River which starts beneath them.

The mountains were named The Remarkables by Alexander Garvie in 1857–58 because of the serrated peaks of the range. The range was earlier known as the Crosscuts for the same reason.

==The Remarkables Ski Area==
During the winter months, the Remarkables Ski Area has skiing and other winter activities. The ski area is situated over three mountain bowls covering 220 ha (540 acres) with eight lifts (4 chairlifts, 4 magic carpets). Terrain is rated as 30% beginners, 40% intermediate and 30% advanced. Average annual snowfall is 3.67 metres. 

NZSki Limited operates The Remarkables Ski Area under agreements with the New Zealand government, primarily involving the Department of Conservation (DOC). The ski area is situated within the Rastus Burn Recreation Reserve, a conservation area managed by DOC.

In 2023, NZSki submitted an application for a new 40-year concession. This application sought permissions encompassing a lease, license, and easement to manage and control all activities related to the ownership, operation, repair, and maintenance of The Remarkables ski area. The proposal included plans for extending the base building and maintenance facilities, as well as installing three additional snow fences. Public submissions on this application closed on May 3, 2023, and a virtual hearing was held on May 24, 2023.

Additionally, NZSki has expressed intentions to expand the ski area into the adjacent Doolans Basin, which would significantly increase the skiable terrain. This proposed expansion would require a new concession, as the Doolans Basin is part of the larger Remarkables Conservation Area. The expansion plan includes constructing new chairlifts or gondolas, developing ski trails, and establishing necessary infrastructure such as snowmaking facilities and visitor amenities.

<text>All (stylized ALL) is an American pop-punk band originally from Los Angeles, California, currently based in Fort Collins, Colorado. The group was formed by Descendents members Bill Stevenson, Karl Alvarez, and Stephen Egerton.

== History ==

=== Formation and Cruz Records years ===
All formed in suburban Los Angeles in 1987 when Milo Aukerman, the lead singer of the Descendents, left to pursue a graduate degree in biochemistry, forcing the band into a hiatus. The remaining members, guitarist Stephen Egerton, bassist Karl Alvarez, and drummer Bill Stevenson, decided to carry on as a band, adopting the title of the Descendents&#x27; last studio album, &quot;ALL&quot;, as their official moniker.

Enlisting former Dag Nasty and DYS singer Dave Smalley on vocal duties, ALL released their first two albums in 1988, &quot;Allroy Sez&quot; and the EP &quot;Allroy for Prez&quot; (both distributed by Cruz Records), to critical acclaim. In 1989, Smalley left the band, and new vocalist Scott Reynolds joined. With Reynolds, ALL released four more albums: 1989&#x27;s &quot;Allroy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (which included the single &quot;She&#x27;s My Ex&quot;), 1990&#x27;s &quot;Allroy Saves&quot;, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Percolater&quot;, and the 1990 live album &quot;Trailblazer&quot;. Also during this time, the band recorded &quot;New Girl, Old Story&quot;, an album with former Descendents member Tony Lombardo under the band name TonyALL.

The band lived in a small office complex (as referenced in the Scott Reynolds–penned song &quot;Box&quot;), and toured nearly nonstop. Following a brief stint in rural Brookfield, Missouri, the band eventually relocated to Fort Collins, Colorado; the centrally located city made touring the west and east coasts of the country considerably easier. Reynolds left the band in 1993 and was replaced by vocalist Chad Price. The album &quot;Breaking Things&quot; was released in 1993 to generally positive reviews, and the songs &quot;Guilty&quot; and &quot;Shreen&quot; were released as singles.

=== Interscope/Epitaph years ===
ALL briefly joined major label Interscope Records for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Pummel&quot;, but disputes over marketing and promotion of the album ended their relationship quickly. The song &quot;Million Bucks&quot; was released as a single and a video, but the album ultimately received rather mixed reviews from fans and critics alike. The band was signed by Epitaph Records shortly after.

At this time, Milo Aukerman, now a full-time biochemist, returned to the Descendents and recorded their 1996 comeback album &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, also on Epitaph. Stevenson, Alvarez, and Egerton continued to tour and record with both bands, eventually releasing ALL&#x27;s critically acclaimed 1998 album &quot;Mass Nerder&quot;, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Problematic&quot;, and the 2001 Descendents/ALL live split, &quot;Live Plus One&quot;.

According to a 2004 interview with Bill Stevenson, ALL is no longer under contract with Epitaph Records, and any new ALL material will be released on their own label, Owned &amp; Operated Records

=== Hiatus ===
The band has previously talked about having two albums in the works; however, there has not been any news on them in some time. One album, which was written and partially recorded in early 2002 while the band was recording the Descendents&#x27; album &quot;Cool to Be You&quot;, is reported to consist of all-new material with the familiar All sound, while the other is planned to be much more experimental, with a heavier emphasis on instrumental compositions.

All went through a multi-year period of inactivity, with members working on other projects across the country. Bill Stevenson and Karl Alvarez both live in Fort Collins, Colorado; Stevenson is currently playing with Only Crime and the Lemonheads, and running his own recording studio, The Blasting Room, while Alvarez has contributed bass to the Lemonheads&#x27; 2006 album and Underminer and has toured with Gogol Bordello. Stephen Egerton currently lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with his family, running his own studio, Armstrong Records. Stephen has several music projects in the works. The first, 40Engine, is with former vocalist Scott Reynolds; another is an instrumental band named Slorder, and he also plays bass and drums with a guitarist named Jason Crowley under the name Crowley/Egerton. Chad Price is playing in the Colorado alt-country band Drag the River and tours playing bass for Rocky Votolato.

=== Reunion ===

On January 26, 2008, Egerton, Stevenson, and Alvarez reunited with Scott Reynolds to play a set of All songs as an opening act for Drag the River at the Aggie in Fort Collins. In mid-April of that year, the band announced that they would be reuniting once again with Reynolds for Chicago, Illinois&#x27;s Riot Fest on October 12. They performed at the Congress Theater in Chicago, playing for less than an hour before Chicago police shut down the show.

Additionally, All performed two warm-up shows: one in Japan in July 2008 and the other at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on August 29, 2008. The DNC show was cut short and the band completed an additional set that evening at the 3 Kings Tavern in downtown Denver.

In July 2009 the band completed a short tour with fellow Cruz Records alums Big Drill Car, going across Southern California. Former Descendents bandmate Tony Lombardo joined the band on stage on July 18 and 19 of that tour for two songs, to a very welcoming crowd.

In an interview with RiotFest.org, Scott Reynolds did not rule out the possibility of writing new material but set three conditions that need to be present: people want to hear new music, he feels the need to create, and the &quot;bro&quot; factor between the bandmates needs to be there.

All played a one-off performance in Portland, Oregon, at Dante&#x27;s on October 3, 2009.

In the beginning of 2010, the band was set to perform a short tour on the East Coast, with Off with Their Heads and Shot Baker. The shows were postponed due to health issues with Bill Stevenson, and were never rescheduled. At the 2011 Punk Rock Bowling, the band played a set with all three of their singers, Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. From 2011 to 2014 the band played various shows around the U.S. On February 16, 2013, the band performed at The Mohawk in Austin, Texas, as part of a cancer benefit.

On September 9, 2014, after a showing of Filmage at the Downtown Independent theater in Los Angeles, ALL played a dual set with both Chad and Scott, followed by a karaoke part where both Chad and Scott sang songs, along with surprise guest vocalists: London May (Samhain); Phi Lo (the Last); members of the &quot;Filmage&quot; crew, James, Justin &amp; Deedle; Jen Razavi (the Bombpops); Marko DeSantis (Bad Astronaut) &amp; Ken Stringfellow (Posies); Dennis Lyxzén (Refused); Davey Havok (AFI); Jim Lindberg (Pennywise); and Matt Skiba (Alkaline Trio, Blink 182).
With Chad in vocals, ALL played Amnesia Rockfest in 2015.

Throughout the &#x27; touring cycle from 2016 to 2018, both Chad and Scott have performed songs with the band at various shows. On August 3, 2018, during a show in Buffalo, New York, the band performed two songs after bringing out Scott Reynolds as a special guest. On November 18, 2018, All played a show to celebrate the ending their 2018 &quot;Tourage&quot; where they played a dual set with both Scott and Chad on vocals in Tulsa.

ALL played two sets at Washington&#x27;s in Fort Collins, Colorado in November 2019 with Dave Smalley and Scott Reynolds to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the Blasting Room. Their next show took place with Chad on vocals at Punk Rock Bowling in 2021. They have since reunited to play Fest in 2023, and a Punk Rock Bowling pre show in 2024.

== Mascot ==
All&#x27;s mascot is Allroy, a neon bright yellow cartoon character with spiked hair, for eyes, and a large, toothy grin, often depicted engaged in conflict with an anthropomorphic musical note. Allroy was created by bassist Karl Alvarez, based on a caricature he had drawn of guitarist Stephen Egerton for the Descendents&#x27; 1987 &quot;FinALL&quot; tour posters. &quot;When they go out on tour, Stephen likes to be the one that drives&quot;, said artist Chris Shary. &quot;Well, he&#x27;d been up for a while, just pounding coffee, and Karl was in the back, and Stephen just turned back to look at him and it was this crazed [look], like almost the eyes spinning, and the big grin, and so Karl drew that out and that was the FinALL tour drawing. It just kind of went from there and got tweaked a little bit, and there was Allroy.&quot; Meant to be All&#x27;s equivalent to the Descendents&#x27; Milo character, Allroy is &quot;representative of all things Allular&quot;, said Alvarez, adding &quot;I swear to God I&#x27;d never seen &quot;The Simpsons&quot; when I drew that design&quot;, noting the character&#x27;s resemblance to Bart Simpson (the Simpson family characters debuted April 19, 1987, on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, while Allroy debuted a year later on the cover of All&#x27;s debut album &quot;Allroy Sez&quot;).

Allroy is the eponymous character of All&#x27;s early releases &quot;Allroy Sez&quot; (1988), &quot;Allroy for Prez&quot; (1988), &quot;Allroy&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1989), and &quot;Allroy Saves&quot; (1990), and appears on the covers of these releases in illustrations done by Alvarez. Allroy was absent from the band&#x27;s cover art for much of the 1990s before being revived for &quot;Mass Nerder&quot; (1998), as drawn by Chris Shary. Shary also drew Allroy for the cover of the compilation album &quot;All&quot; (1999), and he and Alvarez together illustrated the character for the cover of &quot;Problematic&quot; (2000).

<text>Î, î (i-circumflex) is a letter in the Friulian, Kurdish, Tupi, Persian Rumi, and Romanian alphabets and phonetic Filipino. This letter also appears in French, Turkish, Italian, Welsh and Walloon as a variant of the letter “i”.

==Afrikaans==
In Afrikaans, î is a punctuated form of i: &#x27;, the plural of &#x27; (&#x27;wedge&#x27;).
==French==

Î is a letter which appears in several French words, like &#x27; (to be born), &#x27; (abyss), &#x27; (master), &#x27; (fresh), and more. Unlike Â, Ê, and Ô, the circumflex does not alter the pronunciation of î or û.

The circumflex usually denotes the exclusion of a letter (usually an s) that was in a prior version of the word:
* &#x27; became &#x27;.
* &#x27; became &#x27; and then &quot;.
* &#x27; became &#x27; and then &quot;.

The 1990 spelling reforms removed the accents if they are not required to distinguish between homonyms and so &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; no longer take the circumflex. &#x27;, however, (meaning &#x27;your one&#x27; as a pronoun) uses the circumflex to distinguish it from &#x27; (meaning &#x27;your&#x27; as a possessive determiner).

==Friulian==

Î is used to get a longer value of I, becoming . It can be found for example in all verbs of the fourth conjugation: &#x27; , (to revel). Another use of Î (and also the other long vowels), is due to Latin derivation. Instead of preserving the last vowel, in Friulian it was used to give a longer value to the penultimate vowel, ending the word with a consonant: gliru(m) &lt; &#x27;, (dormouse), where the ending &quot;u&quot; disappeared.

==Italian==
In Italian the circumflex accent is an optional accent. While the accent itself has many uses, with the letter &quot;i&quot; it is only used while forming the plural of male nouns ending in &#x27; in order to minimize both ambiguity and the stressing of the wrong syllable: &#x27; (principle) has the plural &#x27; , and &#x27; (prince) has &quot;&quot; as plural. In this situation it can be replaced with a double &quot;i&quot; (E.g. &quot;principii&quot; ), with an i followed by a j (E.g. &quot;principij&quot;), with a single j (E.g. &quot;principj&quot;) or, more simply, with a single &quot;i&quot; (E.g. &quot;principi&quot;). In contemporary usage, the single &quot;i&quot; is mostly used and the other variants are seen as archaic and overly formal.

==Kurdish==
Î is the 12th letter of the Kurdish alphabet and represents : &quot;&quot; (, &#x27;Kurdish language&#x27;).

==Persian==
Î is used in the Persian Latin (Rumi) alphabet, equivalent to ي.

==Romanian==
Î is the 12th letter of the Romanian alphabet and denotes . This sound is also represented in Romanian as letter â. The difference is that â is used in the middle of a word, as in &#x27;, but î is used at the beginning or the end of a word: &#x27; (understanding), &#x27; (to hate). A compound word starting with the letter î retains it, even if it is in the middle of the word: &#x27; (misunderstanding). However, if a suffix is added, the î changes into â, as in the example: &#x27; (to hate), &#x27; (hated).

==Turkish==
In Turkish, î can indicate the sound in Arabic loanwords where it is used as an adjectival suffix that makes an adjective from a noun: &quot;askerî&quot; (military), &quot;millî&quot; (national), &quot;dâhilî&quot; (internal) etc.

==Welsh==
In Welsh, &quot;î&quot; is used to represent long stressed &quot;i&quot; when, without the circumflex, the vowel would be pronounced as short (&#x27; , the mutated form of &quot;team&quot;), as opposed to &#x27; &quot;no, nought, nothing&quot;.

== Filipino ==
In Tagalog and other Philippine languages, the circumflex, also called as &#x27;Pakupyâ&#x27;, is used to indicate a (stressed) Glottal stop &#x27;ʔ&#x27;. It is however not used in casual text, but used in formal writing and to differentiate between Homographs.

e.g.: &#x27;&quot;Pinunò&quot;&#x27; means &#x27;leader&#x27;.

&#x27;&quot;Pinunô&quot;&#x27; means &#x27;filled&#x27;.

==Other usage==
===In mathematics===
* The letter formula_1 is sometimes used to denote a unit vector in physics.

<doc id="249024" wikidata="Q14291" url="?curid=249024" title="Ï">
<text>Ï, lowercase ï, is a symbol used in various languages written with the Latin alphabet; it can be read as the letter I with diaeresis, I-umlaut or I-trema.

Initially in French and also in Afrikaans, Catalan, Dutch, Galician, Southern Sami, Welsh, and occasionally English, is used when follows another vowel and indicates hiatus in the pronunciation of such a word. It indicates that the two vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, rather than together as a diphthong or digraph. For example, French &quot;maïs&quot; (; &quot;maize&quot;); without the diaeresis, the is part of the digraph : &quot;mais&quot; (; *but&quot;). The letter is also used in the same context in Dutch, as in &quot;Oekraïne&quot; ( *; &quot;Ukraine&quot;), and English &quot;naïve&quot; ( or ).

The letter is also used in Ukrainian.
In scholarly writing on Turkic languages, is sometimes used to write the close back unrounded vowel , which, in the standard modern Turkish alphabet, is written as the dotless i . The back neutral vowel reconstructed in Proto-Mongolic is sometimes written .

In the transcription of Amazonian languages, is used to represent the high central vowel .

It is also a transliteration of the rune ᛇ.

==Computing==
Lowercase ï is often seen in the sequences codice_1 and codice_2, which are the Unicode replacement character and byte order mark, respectively, in UTF-8 misinterpreted as ISO-8859-1 or CP1252 (both common encodings in software configured for English-language users). Thus, it tends to indicate that any following mojibake can be corrected by reinterpreting the data as UTF-8.

<doc id="249025" wikidata="Q980011" url="?curid=249025" title="Eames House">
<text>The Eames House (also known as Case Study House No. 8) is a landmark of mid-20th century modern architecture located at 203 North Chautauqua Boulevard in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. It was constructed in 1949, by husband-and-wife design pioneers Charles and Ray Eames, to serve as their home and studio. The house was commissioned by &quot;Arts &amp; Architecture&quot; mags as part of its Case Study House program, challenging architects to design progressive, but modest, homes in Southern California. Charles and Ray moved into the home on Christmas Eve in 1949 and never moved out (Charles died in August 1978 and Ray died in August 1988). Charles&#x27;s daughter, Lucia Eames, inherited the home and created the non-profit organization, the Eames Foundation, in 2004. Still a historic house museum maintained by the Eames Foundation, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006 and serves as a pilgrimage site for nearly 20,000 visitors a year (reservations are required).

==Design and history==

In the early 1940s, John Entenza, the owner of Arts &amp; Architecture magazine and Case Study Program founder, purchased 5 acres of land on a wooded bluff that was once part of Will Rogers&#x27; large estate. He sold 1.4 acres of this land to Charles and Ray in 1945. Their home&#x27;s design was first sketched out by Charles Eames with fellow architect Eero Saarinen in 1945 as a raised steel and glass box projecting out of the slope and spanning the entrance drive before cantilevering dramatically over the front yard. The structure was to be constructed entirely from &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; parts available from steel fabricator catalogs. Immediately after the war, though, these parts were in very short supply. By the time the materials arrived three years later, much pre-construction time had been spent picnicking at and exploring the lot where the house would stand. After a period of intense collaboration between Charles and Ray, the scheme was radically changed to sit more quietly in the land and avoid impinging upon the pleasant meadow that fronted the house. Although Eero Saarinen did not have any contribution to the Eames House as built, he did co-design the Entenza House (Case Study House #9) with Charles Eames next door for John Entenza.
The new Eames House design featured a residence building and a studio building tucked into the landscape&#x27;s slope, with an 8-foot (2.4 m) tall by 200 foot (60 m) long concrete retaining wall. The lower level of the residence features a living room with alcove, hall with closets and spiral staircase, kitchen, and utility space. The upper level holds two bedrooms and overlooks the double-height living room in mezzanine fashion. The residence&#x27;s second story also boasts two bathrooms, multiple hallways filled with aluminum closets, and a wire-embedded skylight. The studio building has a similar mezzanine, but is much shorter in length. The studio&#x27;s ground floor features a utility sink, bathroom, dark room for processing photographs, and a large open space with double-volume height. The upper floor was primarily used as storage, but occasionally became guest quarters. A courtyard was also introduced, separating the residence from the studio space. This revised scheme required only one additional beam. The 17 foot (5.1 m) tall facade is broken down into a rigidly geometric composition of brightly colored and neutral-colored panels between thin steel columns and braces, painted &quot;a warm grey&quot;. Over time, painting schemes allowed the grey to become black. The entry door is marked with a gold-leaf panel above. Planted in the 1880s by Abbot Kinney, an existing row of eucalyptus trees was preserved along the exposed wall of the house, providing some shading and a visual contrast with the house&#x27;s bold facade.

As for the interior design, the Eameses&#x27; collection includes, among others: an Isamu Noguchi floor lamps, folk and Abstract Expressionist art, Japanese kokeshi dolls, Chinese lacquered pillows, Native American baskets, Thonet chairs, and numerous Eames furniture designs (some of which never made it past the prototype stage). The maximalist interiors were grouped by the Eameses in idiosyncratic tableaux and the home&#x27;s interior decorating has sparked conversation of the Eameses &quot;humanizing&quot; modernism.
Of the twenty-five Case Study Houses built, the Eames house is considered the most successful both as an architectural statement and as a comfortable, functional living space. The brash sleekness of the design made it a favorite backdrop for fashion shoots in the 1950s and 1960s for publications such as Vogue. Perhaps the proof of its success in fulfilling its program is the fact that it remained at the center of the Eameses&#x27; life and work from the time they moved in (Christmas Eve 1949) until their deaths.

Eames House is one prominent architectural example with the influence of the De Stijl Movement outside Europe. The sliding walls and windows give it the trademark versatility and openness of the De Stijl Movement.

After the Eameses died, the house was largely unchanged. In 2025, the house narrowly escaped damage in the Palisades Fire, which destroyed much of the rest of Pacific Palisades.

==The Eames Foundation==
The Eames House is operated by The Eames Foundation, a non-profit foundation established in 2004 by Lucia Eames, Charles Eames&#x27;s daughter from his first marriage. The Eames Foundation&#x27;s corporate sponsors are the Eames Office, Herman Miller, and Vitra. On September 20, 2006, the Eames House was designated a National Historic Landmark (and administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day). In 2011, the contents of the living room were reassembled at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art as a centerpiece of the exhibition &quot;California Design, 1930–1965: Living in a Modern Way&quot;.

Also in 2011, the Eames Foundation hired Los Angeles architectural firm Escher GuneWardena to develop a plan for the house, one that would restore and preserve the house as it was in 1988. In 2012, the Getty Conservation Institute pledged about $250,000 to preservation-related research work at the Eames House. In 2013, the Eames Foundation teamed up with the digital marketing agency Nebo to produce limited-edition prints for auction with a goal of raising $150,000; every donation will be matched by an Authenticity Fund created by modern furniture manufacturers Herman Miller and Vitra.

Lucia Eames died in 2014, leaving her five children as the Board of Directors of the Eames Foundation. Together, with the help of staff and docents, they oversee the ownership, conservation, and visitor services of the two structures, landscaping, and Charles and Ray&#x27;s belongings. The Eames Foundation&#x27;s 250 Year Project hopes to conserve and care for the home for 250 years into the future.

The Eames House is open to the public five days a week for reservations, which include exterior self-guided visits, private interior tours, picnics, events, and more.

==Literature==
In February 2010, LAS Magazine posted an article about the building&#x27;s history and current significance to the Eames Century Modern Collection, a typography project by design studio House Industries.

In April 2019, the Getty Conservation Institute released the Conservation Management Plan (CMP) of the Eames House. This publication spanned over 200 pages and featured Eames House history, current use of the property, potential damage and ecological risks, and mitigations for conservation. This publication will aid the Eames Foundation&#x27;s 250 Year Project for conservation and serves as a tool for other stewards of modern architecture around the globe.

<doc id="249027" wikidata="Q476" url="?curid=249027" title="Ñ">
<text>Ñ or ñ (, ), is a letter of the modern Latin alphabet, formed by placing a tilde (also referred to as a in Spanish, in order to differentiate it from other diacritics, which are also called ) on top of an upper- or lower-case . It became part of the Spanish alphabet in the eighteenth century when it was first formally defined, but it has subsequently been used in other languages, such as Galician, Asturian, the Aragonese &quot;Grafía de Uesca&quot;, Basque, Chavacano, some Philippine languages (especially Filipino and Bisayan), Chamorro, Guarani, Quechua, Mapudungun, Mandinka, Papiamento, and Tetum alphabets, as well as in Latin transliteration of Tocharian and many Indian languages, where it represents or (similar to the in &quot;canyon&quot;). It represents (the in &quot;wing&quot;) in Crimean Tatar, Kazakh, ALA-LC romanization for Turkic languages, the Common Turkic Alphabet, Nauruan and romanized Quenya. In Breton and in Rohingya, it denotes nasalization of the preceding vowel.

Unlike many other letters that use diacritics (such as in Catalan and Spanish and in Catalan and sometimes in Spanish), in Spanish, Galician, Basque, Asturian, Leonese, Guarani and Filipino is considered a letter in its own right, has its own name (Spanish: &quot;&quot;), and its own place in the alphabet (after ). Historically, it came from a superscript abbreviation for a doubled . Its alphabetical independence is similar to the Germanic , which came from a doubled .

==History==
Historically, arose as a ligature of ; the tilde was shorthand for the second , written over the first; compare umlaut, of analogous origin. It is a letter in the Spanish alphabet that is used for many words—for example, the Spanish word &quot;year&quot; ( in Old Spanish) derived from . Other languages used the macron over an or to indicate simple doubling.

Already in medieval Latin palaeography, the sign that in Spanish came to be called (&quot;little comma&quot;) was used over a vowel to indicate a following nasal consonant ( or ) that had been omitted, as in &quot;tãtus&quot; for &quot;tantus&quot; or &quot;quã&quot; for &quot;quam&quot;. This usage was passed on to other languages using the Latin alphabet although it was subsequently dropped by most. Spanish retained it, however, in some specific cases, particularly to indicate the palatal nasal, the sound that is now spelt as . The word &quot;tilde&quot; comes from Spanish, derived by metathesis of the word &quot;título&quot; as &quot;tidlo&quot;, this originally from Latin &quot;title&quot; or &quot;heading&quot;; compare &quot;cabildo&quot; with Latin .

From spellings of &quot;anno&quot; abbreviated as &quot;año&quot;, as explained above, the tilde was thenceforth transferred to the and kept as a useful expedient to indicate the new palatal nasal sound that Spanish had developed in that position: &quot;año&quot;. The sign was also adopted for the same palatal nasal in all other cases, even when it did not derive from an original , as in (from Latin &quot;ligna&quot;) or (from Latin ).

Other Romance languages have different spellings for this sound: Italian and French use , a consonant cluster that had evolved from Latin, whereas Occitan and Portuguese chose and Catalan even though these digraphs had no etymological precedent.

When Morse code was extended to cover languages other than English, a sequence ( — — · — — ) was allotted for this character.

Although is used by other languages whose spellings were influenced by Spanish, it has recently been chosen to represent the identity of the Spanish language.

== Cross-linguistic usage ==
In Spanish it represents a palatal nasal. This is also the case of Philippine languages, Aymara, Quechua, Mapudungún, Guarani, Basque, Chamorro, Leonese, Yavapai, and , whose orthographies have some basis in that of Spanish. Many languages of Senegal also use it in the same way. Senegal is unique among countries of West Africa in using this letter.

It also represents a palatal nasal in Galician and Uruguayan Portuguese.

In Tetum, it was adopted to represent the same sound in Portuguese loanwords represented by , although this is also used in Tetum, as is , influenced by Indonesian.

In Tagalog, Visayan, and other Philippine languages, most Spanish terms that include are respelled with . The conventional exceptions (with considerable variations) are proper names, which usually retain and their original Spanish or Hispanicised spelling (, , , ). It is collated as the 15th letter of the Filipino alphabet. In old Filipino orthography, the letter was also used, along with , to represent (except at the end of a word, when would be used) if appropriate instead of a tilde, which originally spanned a sequence of and (as in ), such as &quot;pan͠galan&quot; (&quot;name&quot;). That is because the old orthography was based on Spanish, and without the tilde, &quot;pangalan&quot; would have been pronounced with the sequence (therefore &quot;pang-GAlan&quot;). The form became a more common way to represent until the early 20th century, mainly because it was more readily available in typesets than the tilde spanning both letters.

It is also used to represent the velar nasal in Crimean Tatar and Nauruan. In Malay, the Congress Spelling System (1957–1972) formerly used it for before . In Turkmen, it was used for until 1999. In Latin-script writing of the Tatar language and Lule Sámi language, is sometimes used as a substitute for ꞑ, which is not available on many computer systems. In addition to Tatar, represents in the Common Turkic Alphabet.

In the Breton language, it nasalises the preceding vowel, as in , which corresponds to the French name and has the same pronunciation.

It is used in a number of English terms of Spanish origin, such as &quot;jalapeño&quot;, &quot;piña colada&quot;, &quot;piñata&quot;, and &quot;El Niño&quot;. The Spanish word &quot;cañón&quot;, however, became naturalized as &quot;canyon&quot;. Until the middle of the 20th century, adapting it as &quot;nn&quot; was more common in English, as in the phrase &quot;Battle of Corunna&quot;. Now, it is almost always left unmodified. The Society for the Advancement of Spanish Letters in the Anglo Americas (SASLAA) is the preeminent organization focused on promoting the permanent adoption of into the English language.

== Cultural significance ==

 has come to represent the identity of the Spanish language. Latin publisher Bill Teck labeled Hispanic culture and its influence on the United States &quot;Generation Ñ&quot; and later started a magazine with that name. Organizations such as the Instituto Cervantes and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists have adopted the letter as their mark for Hispanic heritage. It was used in the Spanish Republican Air Force for aircraft identification. The circumstances surrounding the crash of serial &#x27;Ñ&#x27; Potez 540 plane that was shot down over the Sierra de Gúdar range of the Sistema Ibérico near Valdelinares inspired French writer André Malraux to write the novel &quot;L&#x27;Espoir&quot; (1937), translated into English as &quot;Man&#x27;s Hope&quot; and made into the movie named &quot;&quot;.

In 1991, a European Community report recommended the repeal of a regulation preventing the sale in Spain of computer products not supporting &quot;all the characteristics of the Spanish writing system,&quot; claiming that it was a protectionist measure against the principles of the free market. This would have allowed the distribution of keyboards without an &quot;Ñ&quot; key. The Real Academia Española stated that the matter was a serious attack against the language. Nobel Prize winner in literature Gabriel García Márquez expressed his disdain over its elimination by saying: &quot;The &#x27;Ñ&#x27; is not an archaeological piece of junk, but just the opposite: a cultural leap of a Romance language that left the others behind in expressing with only one letter a sound that other languages continue to express with two.&quot;
Among other forms of controversy are those pertaining to the anglicization of Spanish surnames. The replacement of with another letter alters the pronunciation and meaning of a word or name, in the same manner that replacing any letter in a given word with another one would. For example, &quot;Peña&quot; is a common Spanish surname and a common noun that means &quot;rocky hill&quot;; it is often anglicized as &quot;Pena&quot;, changing the name to the Spanish word for &quot;pity&quot;, often used in terms of sorrow.

When Federico Peña was first running for mayor of Denver in 1983, the &quot;Denver Post&quot; printed his name without the tilde as &quot;Pena.&quot; After he won the election, they began printing his name with the tilde. As Peña&#x27;s administration had many critics, their objections were sometimes whimsically expressed as &quot;ÑO.&quot;

Since 2011, CNN&#x27;s Spanish-language news channel incorporates a new logo wherein a tilde is placed over both .

Another news channel, TLN en Español, has , with taking the place of the expected , as its logo.

As part of April Fool&#x27;s Day, in 2013, Puerto Rican linguistics professor Aida Vergne penned a mock newspaper article stating that the Royal Spanish Academy had opted to eliminate from Spanish, instead being replaced by the original in Old Spanish. As the Academy had previously eliminated letters such as and , such an allegation was taken seriously and occasionally the Academy has to resort to deny and clarify the allegation.

The Google Doodle for 23 April 2021 celebrated as part of UN Spanish Language Day.

In Unicode has the code U+00D1 (decimal 209) while has the code U+00F1 (decimal 241). Additionally, they can be generated by typing &quot;N&quot; or &quot;n&quot; followed by a combining tilde modifier, &amp;#x303, U+0303, decimal 771.

In HTML character entity reference, the codes for and are codice_1 and codice_2 or codice_3 and codice_4.

 has its own key in the Spanish and Latin American keyboard layouts (see the corresponding sections at keyboard layout and Tilde#Role of mechanical typewriters). The following instructions apply only to English-language keyboards.

On Android devices, holding &quot;N&quot; or &quot;n&quot; down on the keyboard makes entry of and possible.

On Apple Macintosh operating systems (including Mac OS X), it can be typed by pressing and holding the Option key and then typing &quot;N&quot;, followed by typing either &quot;N&quot; or &quot;n&quot;.

On the iPhone and iPad, which use the Apple iOS operating system, the is accessed by holding down the key, which opens a menu (on an English-language keyboard). Apple&#x27;s Mac OS X 10.7 Lion operating system also made the available in the same way.

The lowercase can be made in the Microsoft Windows operating system by typing or on the numeric keypad (with Num Lock turned on); the uppercase can be made with or . Character Map in Windows identifies the letter as &quot;Latin Small/Capital Letter N With Tilde&quot;. A soft (not physical) Spanish-language keyboard is easily installed in Windows.

In Microsoft Word, can be typed by pressing Control-Shift-Tilde () and then an .

On Linux it can be created by pressing Ctrl+Shift+U and then typing &#x27;00d1&#x27; or &#x27;00f1&#x27;, followed by space or Ctrl to end the character code input. This produces or .

Another option (for any operating system) is to configure the system to use the US-International keyboard layout, with which can be produced either by holding Alt Gr and then pressing &quot;N&quot;, or by typing the tilde () followed by .

Yet another option is to use a compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then , and then results in . A capital can be substituted to produce , and in most cases the order of and can be reversed.

=== Use in URLs ===
 may be used in internationalized domain names, but it will have to be converted from Unicode to ASCII using Punycode during the registration process (i.e. from www.piñata.com to www.xn--piata-pta.com).

In URLs (except for the domain name), may be replaced by codice_5, and by codice_6. This is not needed for newer browsers. The hex digits represent the UTF-8 encoding of and . This feature allows almost any Unicode character to be encoded, and it is considered important to support languages other than English.

<text>The multiplication sign (), also known as the times sign or the dimension sign, is a mathematical symbol used to denote the operation of multiplication, which results in a product. 

The symbol is also used in botany, in botanical hybrid names.

The form is properly a four-fold rotationally symmetric saltire. The multiplication sign is similar to a lowercase X () which is not a four-fold rotationally symmetric saltire.

==History==
The earliest known use of the symbol to indicate multiplication appears in an anonymous appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier&#x27;s . This appendix has been attributed to William Oughtred, who used the same symbol in his 1631 algebra text, , stating:Multiplication of species [i.e. unknowns] connects both proposed magnitudes with the symbol &#x27;in&#x27; or : or ordinarily without the symbol if the magnitudes be denoted with one letter. 

Other works have been identified in which crossed diagonals appear in diagrams involving multiplied numbers, such as Robert Recorde&#x27;s &quot;The Ground of Arts&quot; and Oswald Schreckenfuchs&#x27;s 1551 edition of &quot;Almagest&quot;, but these are not symbolizations.

==Uses==
In mathematics, the symbol × has a number of uses, including
* Multiplication of two numbers, where it is read as &quot;times&quot; or &quot;multiplied by&quot;
* Cross product of two vectors, where it is usually read as &quot;cross&quot;
* Cartesian product of two sets, where it is usually read as &quot;cross&quot;
* Geometric dimension of an object, such as noting that a room is 10 feet × 12 feet in area, where it is usually read as &quot;by&quot; (e.g., &quot;10 feet by 12 feet&quot;)
* Screen resolution in pixels, such as 1920 pixels across × 1080 pixels down. Read as &quot;by&quot;.
* Dimensions of a matrix, where it is usually read as &quot;by&quot;
* A statistical interaction between two explanatory variables, where it is usually read as &quot;by&quot;

In biology, the multiplication sign is used in a botanical hybrid name, for instance &quot;Ceanothus papillosus&quot; × &quot;impressus&quot; (a hybrid between &quot;C. papillosus&quot; and &quot;C. impressus&quot;) or &quot;Crocosmia × crocosmiiflora&quot; (a hybrid between two other species of &quot;Crocosmia&quot;). However, the communication of these hybrid names with a Latin letter &quot;x&quot; is common, when the actual &quot;×&quot; symbol is not readily available.

The multiplication sign is also used by historians for an event between two dates. When employed between two dates for example 1225 and 1232 the expression &quot;1225×1232&quot; means &quot;no earlier than 1225 and no later than 1232&quot;.

A monadic symbol is used by the APL programming language to denote the sign function.

== Similar notations ==
The lower-case Latin letter is sometimes used in place of the multiplication sign. This is considered incorrect in mathematical writing.

In algebraic notation, widely used in mathematics, a multiplication symbol is usually omitted wherever it would not cause confusion: &quot; multiplied by &quot; can be written as or .

Other symbols can also be used to denote multiplication, often to reduce confusion between the multiplication sign × and the common variable . In some countries, such as Germany, the primary symbol for multiplication is the &quot;dot operator&quot; (as in &quot;&quot;). This symbol is also used in compound units of measurement, e.g., N⋅m (see International System of Units#Lexicographic conventions). In algebra, it is a notation to resolve ambiguity (for instance, &quot;b times 2&quot; may be written as , to avoid being confused with a value called ). This notation is used wherever multiplication should be written explicitly, such as in &quot; for &quot;; this usage is also seen in English-language texts. In some languages, the use of full stop as a multiplication symbol, such as , is common when the symbol for decimal point is comma.

Historically, computer language syntax was restricted to the ASCII character set, and the asterisk became the de facto symbol for the multiplication operator. This selection is reflected in the numeric keypad on English-language keyboards, where the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are represented by the keys , , and , respectively.

== Typing the character ==

==Unicode and HTML entities==
Other variants and related characters:
* 
* (a zero-width space indicating multiplication; The invisible times codepoint is used in mathematical type-setting to indicate the multiplication of two terms without a visible multiplication operator, e.g. when type-setting 2x (the multiplication of the number 2 and the variable x), the invisible times codepoint can be inserted in-between: 2 x )
* (the interpunct, may be easier to type than the dot operator)
* 
* 
* (intended to &quot;explicitly&quot; denote the cross product of two vectors)
*

<text>Ú, ú (u-acute) is a Latin letter used in the Czech, Dobrujan Tatar, Faroese, Hungarian, Icelandic, Karakalpak and Slovak writing systems. This letter also appears in Dutch, Frisian, Irish, Occitan, Catalan, Pinyin, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Galician, and Vietnamese as a variant of the letter &quot;U&quot;.

==Usage in various languages==

===Czech===
Ú/ú is the 34th letter of the Czech alphabet and represents a sound. It is always the first letter of the word except in compound words, such as &quot;&quot; triangle, which is composed of two words: &quot;&quot;, which is derived from &quot;&quot; three, and &quot;&quot;, which means angle. If this sound is elsewhere in the word, letter Ů is used instead.

===Dobrujan Tatar===
Ú/ú is the 28th letter of Dobrujan Tatar alphabet, represents the hight rounded half-advanced ATR or soft vowel /ʉ/ as in &quot;sút&quot; [s̶ʉt̶] &#x27;milk&#x27;. In the vicinity of semivowel y, which occurs rarely, its articulation shifts to high rounded ATR or soft /y/, close to Turkish pronunciation, as in &quot;súymek&quot; [s̶ym̶ec] &#x27;to love&#x27;.
===Faroese===
Ú/ú is the 24th letter of the Faroese alphabet, and may represent the following sounds:
* Short in such words as &quot;krúss&quot; (&quot;mug&quot;, &quot;coffee cup&quot;)
* Short before in such words as &quot;kúgv&quot; (&quot;cow&quot;), but also in &quot;brúdleyp&quot; (&quot;bridal&quot;)
* Long diphthong in &quot;úti&quot; (&quot;out&quot;), &quot;hús&quot; (&quot;house&quot;), &quot;jú&quot; (&quot;but&quot;),

===Hungarian===
Ú/ú is the 36th letter of the Hungarian alphabet and represents a sound.

===Icelandic===
Ú/ú is the 25th letter of the Icelandic alphabet, and represents a sound.

===Javanese===
Ú/ú is the letter of the Javanese Latin alphabet, and represents a sound

===Kazakh===

It was proposed in 2018 that Ú/ú should be one of its Latin script, it should represent the near-close front rounded vowel () and is used to replace Cyrillic Ү. The replacement is modified to be Ü ü in 2020.

===Karakalpak===
Ú/ú is the 26th letter of the Karakalpak alphabet and represents near-close front rounded vowel.

===Slovak===
Ú/ú is the 39th letter of the Slovak alphabet and represents a sound.

===Portuguese/Galician/Spanish/Catalan===
In Portuguese, Galician, Spanish and Catalan, &quot;ú&quot; is not a distinct letter but a modified letter &quot;u&quot;. It is used to denote an &quot;u&quot; with unusual stress.

===Italian===
Ú/ú is a variant of U carrying an acute accent; it represents an /u/ carrying the tonic accent. It is used only if it is the last letter of the word except in dictionaries.

<text>Niš (; , ; names in other languages), less often spelled in English as Nish, is the third largest city in Serbia and the administrative center of the Nišava District. It is located in the southern part of Serbia. , the city proper has a population of 182,797, while its administrative area (City of Niš) has a population of 260,237 inhabitants.

Several Roman emperors were born in Niš or used it as a residence: Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor and the founder of Constantinople, Constantius III, Constans, Vetranio, Julian, Valentinian I, Valens; and Justin I. Emperor Claudius Gothicus decisively defeated the Goths at the Battle of Naissus (present-day Niš). Later playing a prominent role in the history of the Byzantine Empire, the city&#x27;s past would earn it the nickname &quot;Imperial City.&quot;

After about 400 years of Ottoman rule, the city was liberated in 1878 and became part of the Principality of Serbia, though not without great bloodshed—remnants of which can be found throughout the city. Today, Niš is one of the most important economic centers in Serbia, especially in the electronics, mechanical engineering, textile, and tobacco industries. Constantine the Great Airport is Niš&#x27;s international airport. The city is also the seat of the University of Niš, the Eparchy of Niš and the Command of Serbian Army.

In 2013, the city was host to the celebration of 1700 years of Constantine&#x27;s Edict of Milan.

==Name==
Niš was known as Нишь or Ньшь (&quot;Nyšь&quot;) in Old Serbian and Old Bulgarian. &quot;Nāissus&quot; is the Ancient name of the city. Naissus is itself probably a derivative of the older *&quot;Nāviskos&quot;, from *&quot;Nāvia&quot; (&quot;trough valley&quot;), the Celtic name of the Nišava River, which flows through the city. In historical sources, the town is mentioned as Naissus, Ναϊσσός, Naessus, urbs Naisitana, Нишь, Ньшь, Nisso and Nix.

&quot;Niš&quot; evolved from the toponym attested in Ancient Greek as &quot;ΝΑΙΣΣΟΣ&quot; (Naissos) achieving its present form via phonetic changes in Proto-Albanian and thereafter the placename entered Slavic. &quot;Nish&quot; might indicate that Proto-Albanian was spoken in the region in pre-Slavic antiquity. According to Ismajli (2015), when this settlement happened is a matter of debate, as Proto-Albanians might have moved relatively late in antiquity in the area which might have been an eastern expansion of Proto-Albanian settlement as no other toponyms known in antiquity in the area presuppose an Albanian development. It cannot be ruled out however that the development of &quot;Nish&quot; &lt; &quot;Naiss-&quot; may also represent a regional development in late antiquity Balkans which, while closely related to Albanian (i.e. characterized by the same phonetic system), may not be identical with it. Attempts have been made to explain the place name in various ways as &quot;a purely Slavic development&quot;, such as by Serbian linguist Aleksandar Loma, however, Austrian linguist Joachim Matzinger, who maintains the Albanian transmission of &quot;Naiss &gt; Niš&quot;, states that &quot;a discussion with historical South Slavic linguistics is an urgent desideratum&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The first settlement on the site of today&#x27;s Niš may have been founded by the Celts at the end of the 3rd century BC. There is very little archaeological evidence however which can be used to reconstruct a pre-Roman history of Niš. During the Roman era, the city of Naissus became a large urban center. During the Roman conquest of the Balkans, between 168 and 75 BC, the city was used as a base of operations. Naissus was first mentioned in Roman documents near the beginning of the 2nd century CE, and was considered a place worthy of note in the &quot;Geography&quot; of Ptolemy of Alexandria.

The Romans occupied the town during the Dardanian campaign (75–73 BC), and set up a legionary camp in the city. The city, called &quot;refugia&quot; and &quot;vici&quot; in pre-Roman relation, as a result of its strategic position (the Thracians were based to the south) developed as an important garrison and market town in the province of Moesia Superior. In 169 AD, Naissus was established as a municipium and from Diocletian onwards it belonged to the province of Dardania. In 272, the future Emperor Constantine the Great was born in Naissus. Constantine created the Dacia Mediterranea province, of which Naissus was the capital, which also included Remesiana on the Via Militaris and the towns of Pautalia and Germania. He lived in Naissus briefly from 316 to 322.

The city was of great importance for the Constantinian dynasty. It is the birthplace of Constantine the Great who turned it from a middle-sized town to a large city with many public buildings. The city flourished greatly in the Constantinian period. A bronze bust of Constantine decorated city. It was his temporary residence and the city where he promulgated many laws, preserved in the Theodosian code. In Constantinian narratives, Naissus was the city where the usurper Vetranio abdicated to Constantius II after a powerful speech he gave to the rebel armies. Julian, the last Constantinian emperor, used Naissus, which had arms factories, as his base in the civil war and recruited Illyrians and others as soldiers for his campaign.

In 364 AD, the imperial Villa Mediana was the site where emperors Valentinian and Valens met and divided the Roman Empire into halves which they would rule as co-emperors.

It was besieged by the Huns in 441 and devastated in 448, and again in 480 when the partially-rebuilt town was demolished by the Barbarians. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I restored the town but it was destroyed by the Avars once again. The Slavs, in their campaign against Byzantium, conquered Niš and settled here in 540.

===Middle Ages===

In 805, the town and its surroundings were taken by Bulgarian Emperor Krum. In the 11th century Byzantium reclaimed control over Naissus and the surrounding area.
King Solomon of Hungary and Prince Géza marched along the valley of the river Great Morava as far as Niš. The Hungarians seized the Byzantine city without any resistance in 1072. During the People&#x27;s Crusade, on 3 July 1096, Peter the Hermit clashed with Byzantine forces at Naissus. Manuel I fortified the town, but under his successor Andronikos I it was seized by the Hungarian king Béla III. Byzantine control was eventually reestablished, but in 1185 it fell under Serbian control. By 1188, Niš became the capital of Serbian king Stefan Nemanja. On 27 July 1189, Nemanja received German emperor Frederick Barbarossa and his 100,000 crusaders at Niš. Niš is mentioned in descriptions of Serbia under Vukan in 1202, highlighting its special status. In 1203, Kaloyan of Bulgaria annexed Niš. Stefan Nemanjić later regained the region.

===Ottoman period===
The fall of the Serbian Empire, which was conquered by Ottoman Sultan Murad I in 1385, decided the fate of Niš as well. After a 25-day-long siege the city fell to the Ottomans. It was returned to Serbian rule in 1443. Niš again fell under Ottoman rule in 1448, and remained thusly for 241 years. During Ottoman rule Niš was a seat of the empire&#x27;s military and civil administration. A Silesian traveler stated in 1596 that the route from Sofia to Niš was littered with corpses and described the gates of Niš as bedecked with the freshly-severed heads of poor Bulgarian peasants. In 1689, Niš was seized by the Austrian army during the Great Turkish War, but the Ottomans regained it in 1690. In 1737, Niš was again seized by the Austrians, who attempted to rebuild the fortifications around the city. The same year, the Ottomans reclaimed the city without resistance. The existing fortification is of Ottoman Turkish origin, dating from the first decades of the 18th century (1719–1723). It is well known as one of the most significant and best preserved monuments of this kind in the mid-Balkans. The Fortress was erected on the site of earlier fortifications – the ancient Roman, Byzantine, and later yet Medieval forts.
During the First Serbian uprising in 1809, Serbian revolutionaries attempted to liberate Niš in the Battle of Čegar. After the defeat of the Serbian forces, the Ottoman commander of Niš ordered the heads of the slain Serbs mounted on a tower to serve as a warning. The structure became known as Skull Tower (). In 1821, the Ottomans arrested the Bishop of Niš, Milentija, as well as 200 Serbian patriots, on charges of preparing an uprising in the Niš area in support of the Greek War of Independence. On June 13 of that year, Bishop Milentija and other Serbian leaders were hanged in public.

In the 19th century Niš was an important town, but populated by Bulgarians in the 19th century, when the Niš rebellion broke out in 1841. According to Ottoman statistics during the Tanzimat the population of Sanjak of Niš was treated as Bulgarian, and according to French travelers such as Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui and Ami Boue in 1837/1841. According to all authors between 1840 and 1872 the delineation between Bulgarians and Serbs is undisputed and ran north of Nis, although one author Cyprien Robert claims that half of the population of the town was made up by Serbians. Serbian cartographers of the time (such as Dimitrije Davidović in 1828 and Milan Savić in 1878) also accepted South Morava river as such delineation and added Niš outside the borders of the Serbian people. In 1862 some Muslim families from Belgrade and Smederevo settled in Nis due to the forced displacement of Muslims in the Principality of Serbia. The urban population of Niš consisted of 17,107 Christian and 4,291 Muslim males, with total number of 3,500 Serbian houses and 2,000 Muslim houses. Muslim population of Niš consisted mainly of Turks, of which a part were of Albanian origin, and the rest were Muslim Albanians and Muslim Romani.
In 1870, Niš was included in the Bulgarian Exarchate. Before the area had been under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć. The city was also stipulated the area to be ceded to Bulgaria according to the Constantinople Conference in 1876.

Niš was finally taken by the Serbian Army during the Serbo–Ottoman War of 1876–1878. The battle for the liberation of Niš started on 29 December 1877, and the Serbian Army entered Niš on 11 January 1878, and it became a part of Serbia. The Albanian quarter was burned and some of the town&#x27;s Muslim population, which the majority were Albanians, were forced to flee to the Ottoman vilayet of Kosovo, resettling in Pristina, while others went to Skopje. The descendants of the Albanians that resettled in parts of now Kosovo, are now known as Muhaxhir. The number of remaining Muslims counted were 1,168, with many being Muslim Romani, out of the pre-war ca. 8,500. The Albanian bazaar in Niš was destroyed. 12 out of 15 mosques and about 1,300 out of 4,000 houses were torn down, while the rest of the Muslim houses were sold at discounted prices. The destruction of buildings owned by Muslims, Jews and recalcitrant Christians was followed by the widening of streets and other measures to &quot;modernise&quot; the town and weaken its Ottoman outlook. Albanian traders who wanted to stay were subjected to a targeted campaign of murder. The Serbian authorities subjected the Jewish community to extortion of money, arbitrary arrests, confiscation of property, forced labour and desecration of graves. The demographics of Niš underwent change whereby Serbs who formed half the urban population prior to 1878 became 80 percent in 1884.

===Independent Serbia===
In the following years, the city saw rapid development. The city library was founded in 1879 and the famous Serbian writer Stevan Sremac, a native of Niš, was its first clerk. The first hotel, &quot;Europe&quot;, was built in 1879; shortly after the first district hospital and the first bank started operating in 1881. In 1878, the first Grammar School (Gimnazija), in 1882 the Teacher Training College, and in 1894, the Girls&#x27; College were founded in Niš. The City Hall was built from 1882 to 1887.

In 1883, Kosta Čendaš established the first printing house. In 1884, the first newspaper in the city &quot;Niški Vesnik&quot; was started. In 1884, Jovan Apel built a brewery. A railway line to Niš was built in 1884, as well as the city&#x27;s railway station; on 8 August 1884, the first train arrived from Belgrade. In 1885, Niš became the last station of the Orient Express, until the railroad was built between Niš and Sofia in 1888. In 1887, the Niš Theatre Sinđelić was built.

In 1897 Mita Ristić founded the Nitex textile factory. In 1905 the female painter Nadežda Petrović established the Sićevo art colony. The first film was screened in 1897, and the first permanent cinema started operating in 1906. The hydroelectric dam in Sićevo Gorge on the Nišava was built in 1908; at the time, it was the largest in Serbia. The airfield was built in 1912 on the Trupale field, and the first aeroplane arrived on 29 December 1912. The city&#x27;s museum was founded in 1913.

During the First Balkan War, Niš was the seat of The Main Headquarters of the Serbian Army, which led military operations against the Ottoman Empire. In World War I, Niš was the wartime capital of Serbia, hosting the Government and the National Assembly, until Central Powers conquered Serbia in November 1915, when the city was ceded to Bulgaria. After the breakthrough of the Salonika front, the First Serbian Army commanded by general Petar Bojović liberated Niš on 12 October 1918.
===During the age and breakup of Yugoslavia===

In the first few years after the war, Niš was recovering from the damage. In 1921, Niš became the centre of the Region (oblast), governed by a grand-župan, appointed by royal decree. From 1929 to 1941, Niš was the capital of the Morava Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The tram system in Niš started to run in November 1930. The national airline Aeroput included Niš as a regular destination for the route Belgrade—Niš—Skopje—Thessaloniki in 1930. During the time of German occupation in World War II, the first Nazi Crveni Krst concentration camp in Yugoslavia was in Niš. About 30,000 people passed through this camp, of whom over 10,000 were shot on nearby Bubanj hill. On 12 February 1942, 147 prisoners staged a mass escape. In 1944, the city was heavily bombed by the Allies. In September 1943, the Germans established the Dulag 413 transit camp for Italian Military Internees in the city.

On 14 October 1944, after a long and exhausting battle, the 7th German SS Division &#x27;Prinz Eugen&#x27; was defeated and Niš was liberated by Bulgarian Army, and Partisans. The city was also the site of a unique and accidental friendly fire air war on November 7, 1944 between the air forces of the United States and Soviet Union. On 23 June 1948, Niš was the site of a catastrophic flood during which the Nišava river&#x27;s water level raised by an unprecedented 5.5 meters.

After World War II, the University of Niš was founded on 15 June 1965.

Over the course of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Niš was subject to airstrikes on 40 occasions. On 7 May 1999, the city was the site of a NATO cluster bomb raid which killed 16 civilians. By the end of the NATO bombing campaign, a total of 56 people in Niš had been killed from airstrikes.

==Economy==
The city of Niš is the administrative, industrial, commercial, financial and cultural center of the south-eastern part of Republic of Serbia. The position of Niš is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Niš is easily accessible, having an airport – Niš Constantine the Great Airport and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines.

It is in Niš that the trunk road running from the north down the Morava River valley forks into two major lines:

* the south one, leading to Thessalonica and Athens, along the Vardar River valley,
* and the east one, running along the Nišava and the Marica, leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.

These roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as &#x27;Via Militaris&#x27; in Roman and Byzantine periods, or &#x27;Constantinople road&#x27; in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Niš thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.

As of September 2017, Niš has one of 14 free economic zones established in Serbia.

==Transportation==
Niš is strategically between the Morava river valley in North and the Vardar river valley in the south, on the main route between Greece and Central Europe. In the Niš area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the Nišava river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of Sofia and Istanbul. The city has been a passing station for the Orient Express.

The first highways date back to the 1950s when Niš was linked with capital Belgrade through the Brotherhood and Unity Highway, the first in Southeastern Europe.

Historically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the Roman Empire that built the important road Via Militaris, linking the city with &quot;Singidunum&quot; (current Belgrade) to the North and &quot;Constantinople&quot; (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway E75 with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and Skopje, Thessaloniki and Athens in the south. The road E80 connects Niš with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and Pristina, Montenegro and the Adriatic Sea to the West. The road E771 connects the city with Zaječar, Kladovo and Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania.

The city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.

The Niš Constantine the Great Airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Niš was established in 1910, near the village of Donje Međurovo. In the 1930s then-national airline company Aeroput used the airport for civil service. In 1935 Aeroput included a stop in Niš in its route linking Belgrade with Skoplje.

<text>Reiner Knizia () is a prolific German-style board game designer. He was born in West Germany in 1957 and earned a doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Ulm before designing games full time. He is frequently included on lists of the greatest game designers of all time. Many of his hundreds of designs are considered modern classics, and many have won or been nominated for significant gaming awards, including the Spiel des Jahres and the Deutscher Spiele Preis. His notable designs include Amun-Re, Blue Moon City, Ingenious, Keltis, Lord of the Rings, Medici, Modern Art, Ra, Taj Mahal, Tigris and Euphrates, and Through the Desert. Many of his designs incorporate mathematical principles, such as his repeated use of auction mechanics.

==Early life and education==
Knizia was born in Illertissen, West Germany, in 1957. During his childhood, the small town of Illertissen offered only limited access to boardgames (the only place that sold games was the local barbershop, which had a limited selection). He played Monopoly, which had an impact mainly because the paper money allowed other forms of creativity, such as game design. Because of the limited selection of games in his hometown, at age 8 or 9 he began designing games of his own based on themes he found interesting, such as racing and castles, to play with friends. In one childhood design, a board used a fantasy map of spaces on which knights moved to attack pieces of the other player and occupy their castle. As a teenager, he developed an international-themed wargame, and in his 20s he self-published a play-by-mail magazine where readers would send moves which would be announced in new issues.

He later gained a Master of Science degree from Syracuse University in the United States and a doctorate in Mathematics from the University of Ulm in Germany. He went on to manage a two-billion-dollar mortgage services company in the United Kingdom, from which he was able to retire at age 40. He published many magazine-based games while writing for Spielbox (a German games magazine), and began having success publishing boxed games in the 1990s, with two games themed around digging for gold. Goldrausch was centered around the California Gold Rush, and Digging was themed about avoiding bandits while mining for gold.

==Career==
Knizia has been a full-time game designer since 1997, when he quit his job from the board of a large international bank. Knizia has been living in England since 1993.

In addition to having designed over 700 published games, Knizia is highly acclaimed as a designer, having won the Deutscher Spiele Preis four times, a Spiel des Jahres (in addition to a Kinderspiel des Jahres and a special award), and numerous other national and international awards. At the Origins Game Fair in 2002 he was inducted into the Gaming Hall of Fame. His games frequently make appearances on various &quot;top games&quot; lists, including the GAMES 100 list, the BoardGameGeek top 100, and the Internet Top 100 Games List. Several gaming conventions host &quot;Kniziathons&quot;, which are tournaments dedicated to celebrating Knizia-designed games.

Reiner Knizia started developing games for his play-by-mail game zine &quot;Postspillion&quot;, founded in 1985. The zine still exists, and the game Bretton Woods (also a Reiner Knizia design), which was started in 1987, is still going.

One of Knizia&#x27;s best selling games is &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, published in 17 languages with over one million copies sold. His dice game &quot;Pickomino&quot; has also reached 1 million copies sold and his &quot;Keltis&quot; sold over 600,000 copies. His game &quot;Ingenious&quot; has been published in over 20 languages. In 2011, Knizia designed a Star Trek-themed game for NECA/WizKids, based on the 2009 film that &#x27;reset&#x27; the Star Trek universe. In 2015 Ravensburger released &quot;Star Wars VII - Galaxy Rebellion&quot; based on the popular movie franchise.

A number of Knizia designs have been redeveloped for the electronic gaming &amp; console markets. &quot;Ingenious&quot; (aka &quot;Einfach Genial&quot;) and &quot;Keltis&quot; have both appeared in CD-ROM versions; &quot;Lost Cities&quot; was adapted for Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. An original game for the Nintendo DS, &quot;Dr. Reiner Knizia&#x27;s Brainbenders&quot; was published in 2008; &quot;Keltis&quot; for the NDS followed in 2009. Other mobile implementations of Knizia titles include &quot;Lost Cities&quot;, &quot;Battle Line&quot;, &quot;Kingdoms&quot;, &quot;Medici&quot;, &quot;Ra&quot;, &quot;Through the Desert&quot;, &quot;Samurai&quot; and &quot;Tigris and Euphrates&quot;. Knizia has also designed various game applications specifically for the iPhone, including &quot;Robot Master&quot;, &quot;Dice Monster&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Pipes&quot;.

Over several years Knizia has developed a number of hybrid boardgames with electronic components, most notably with German publisher Ravensburger. The first of these was the &quot;King Arthur&quot; adventure game in 2003, later updated for use with the iPhone in 2014. Other titles include &quot;Die Insel&quot;, the award-winning &quot;Wer War&#x27;s?&quot;, &quot;Der Drei ???&quot; and in 2015 &quot;Captain Black&quot; (notable for a talking ghost pirate captain and a 90 cm3 foot3D ship).

==Game characteristics==

Knizia&#x27;s games cover many board game genres. He has designed small two-player card games, children&#x27;s games, and even a live-action roleplaying game.

One element of modern game design that Reiner Knizia has pioneered is abstract theme. Older themed games like Monopoly have traditionally developed their themes by trying to model or emulate the environment or situation they are thematically tied to. So Monopoly has players buying and developing properties as a real estate developer might. Knizia&#x27;s thematic game designs tend not to try to model a specific environment, but instead try to invoke the thought and decision-making processes that are key to the theme. For example, Knizia&#x27;s game &quot;Medici&quot; has a fairly abstract game system of drawing and buying cards that does not try to model any particular environment, but in the game-world, the players are always attempting to price risk, the key success factor in the investment banking business in which the Medicis made their fortune. A further example of this can be found in Knizia&#x27;s game, &quot;Tigris and Euphrates&quot;. The players each take control of one of four different dynasties of Mesopotamia around 3,000 B.C. Each dynasty has priests, farmers, traders, and kings who are placed strategically on the board. The players take turns expanding their dynasties, controlling rivers, building temples, and attacking the other players&#x27; dynasties. Instead of &quot;Tigris and Euphrates&quot; having many complicated rules, the game is relatively simple and has very streamlined rules that does not attempt to emulate the real-life conflicts but rather abstracts this out, allowing for the players to focus on strategic decision making. This approach has allowed Knizia to develop games that are comparatively simple but require thoughtful game-play, while still retaining strongly thematic elements.

Using his understanding of principles in mathematics to full effect, pricing and evaluating risk are frequently recurring elements in Reiner Knizia games. Many of his most successful designs use auctions as a vehicle to price risk, as in &quot;Ra&quot;, &quot;Medici&quot;, and &quot;Modern Art&quot;.

<text>The following is an incomplete list of [[ghost town]]s, listed by continent, then by country.
== Africa ==

=== Angola ===

* Saint Martin of the Tigers (in Portuguese: &quot;São Martinho dos Tigres&quot;), a settlement situated on a peninsula now known as the Tigres Island (in Portuguese: &quot;Ilha dos Tigres&quot;), was originally a small but well-established fishing village. It was supplied with water from the nearby town of Foz do Cunene, at the mouth of the Cunene River. In the 1970s, Saint Martin of the Tigers was cut off from the mainland by the rising sea levels, and its water supply line was severed; both Tigres and Foz do Cunene were subsequently abandoned. The island, bound by the South Atlantic Ocean and the Tigres Strait, lies in a zone that is ideally suited for ecological projects. The island was mentioned in the BBC documentary &quot;Unknown Africa: Angola&quot;.
* Foz do Cunene, located near Saint Martin of the Tigers and similarly abandoned due to rising sea levels.
* Miconje Velho, in northern Cabinda near the Congolese border.
* Nova Cidade de Kilamba was an underoccupied development built by China International Trust and Investment Company near Luanda. Although the city&#x27;s population eventually grew, in early days it was heralded as a ghost town and predicted to stay that way.

=== Central African Republic ===

* Goroumo, Beogombo Deux, and Paoua are among the many deserted villages created by the actions of government forces and killings by armed gangs from the years 2005 to 2008.
* Lere, Central African Republic.

=== Egypt ===

* Avshalom, Dikla, Nahal Yam, Netiv HaAsara, Sufa, Talmei Yosef, Yamit, and Pri&#x27;el were Israeli settlements in the Sinai built after the Six-Day War in 1967.

<doc id="249084" wikidata="Q1702383" url="?curid=249084" title="Johnny Paycheck">
<text>Johnny Paycheck (born Donald Eugene Lytle; May 31, 1938 – February 19, 2003) was an American country music singer and Grand Ole Opry member notable for recording the David Allan Coe song &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;. He achieved his greatest success in the 1970s as a force in country music&#x27;s &quot;outlaw movement&quot; popularized by artists Hank Williams Jr., Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Billy Joe Shaver, and Merle Haggard. In 1980, Paycheck appeared on the PBS music program &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, though in the ensuing decade, his music career slowed due to drug, alcohol, and legal problems. He served a prison sentence in the early 1990s, and his declining health effectively ended his career in early 2000.

== Early life ==
Johnny Paycheck was born Donald Eugene Lytle on May 31, 1938, in Greenfield, Ohio. By age 9, Lytle was already playing in talent contests. He was singing professionally by age 15.

== Career ==

After a stint in the Navy in the 1950s, he relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. He was a tenor harmony singer with numerous hard country performers in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including Ray Price. He worked along with Willie Nelson in Price&#x27;s band the Cherokee Cowboys. He was featured as a tenor singer on recordings by Faron Young, Roger Miller, and Skeets McDonald. In 1960, he reached Top 35 status in &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine&#x27;s country charts as Donny Young with the tune &quot;Miracle Of Love&quot;. In the early 1960s, he convinced country music legend George Jones to hire him. Paycheck provided harmony vocals as well as bass and steel guitar for Jones. He later co-wrote Jones&#x27;s hit song &quot;Once You&#x27;ve Had the Best.&quot; From the early to mid 1960s, he also enjoyed some success as a songwriter for others, with his biggest songwriting hit being &quot;Apartment No. 9&quot;, which served as Tammy Wynette&#x27;s first chart hit in December 1966. 

In 1964, he changed his name legally to Johnny Paycheck, taking the name from Johnny Paychek, a top-ranked boxer from Chicago who once fought Joe Louis for the heavyweight title (and not directly as a humorous alternative to Johnny Cash, as is commonly believed). He first charted under his new name with &quot;A-11&quot; in 1965. His bestselling single from this period was &quot;She&#x27;s All I Got&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the US country singles charts in 1971 and made it onto the Billboard Hot 100. His &quot;Mr. Lovemaker&quot; also reached No. 2 on the US country singles chart in 1973. But with the popularity of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings in the mid-1970s, Paycheck changed his image to that of outlaw, with which he was to have his largest financial success. 

His producer Billy Sherrill helped revive his career by significantly changing his sound and image. Sherrill was best known for carefully choreographing his records and infusing them with considerable pop feel. The Paycheck records were clearly based on Sherrill&#x27;s take on the bands backing Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson on records.

A member of the Grand Ole Opry, Paycheck is best remembered for his 1977 hit single, &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;, written by David Allan Coe, which sold over two million copies and inspired a motion picture of the same name. &quot;Colorado Kool-Aid&quot;, &quot;Me and the IRS&quot;, &quot;Friend, Lover, Wife&quot;, &quot;Slide Off of Your Satin Sheets&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m the Only Hell (Mama Ever Raised)&quot; were other hits for Paycheck during this period. He received an Academy of Country Music Career Achievement award in 1977.
The most successful of his later singles, released during his appeal, was &quot;Old Violin&quot;, which reached No. 21 on the country chart in 1986. His last album to chart was &quot;Modern Times&quot; in 1987. He continued to release albums, the last of which, &quot;Remembering&quot;, appeared in 2002. He continued to perform and tour until the late 1990s. Shortly before his retirement, in 1997, he was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry; in a rare exception to protocol, Opry general manager Bob Whittaker personally invited Paycheck to join instead of having another member do the invitation.

=== Record companies ===
With his producer, Aubrey Mayhew, Paycheck co-owned his record company, Little Darlin&#x27; Records. Paycheck&#x27;s recordings by Little Darlin&#x27; featured the pedal steel guitar work of Lloyd Green. By the end of the 1960s, Little Darlin&#x27; Records folded. Mayhew and Paycheck soon created Certron Records, a newly formed recording company owned by Certron (a manufacturer of audio and video tape). The label was able to sign Bobby Helms, Ronnie Dove, Clint Eastwood, Pozo-Seco Singers (as Pozo Seco), and Paycheck. After the move to Certron, the label was unable to make a profit and closed by 1972. In the late 1990s, after decades ignored, Little Darlin&#x27; recordings received recognition by country music historians for their distinctive and sharp-edged sound, considered unique in their time—Paycheck&#x27;s in particular.

== Personal life ==
Paycheck was married; he and his wife Sharon Rae had a son Jonathan.

=== Legal troubles ===
In the 1950s, he was court-martialed and imprisoned for two years for assaulting a naval officer.

In 1981, Paycheck was arrested on accusations of statutory rape of a 12-year-old girl in Wyoming. Members of Paycheck&#x27;s band told police that the singer had numerous problems with allegations because of his celebrity status. He was released on bond. In 1982, he pled no contest in order to continue his touring and not go to trial. The prosecution&#x27;s witnesses were reluctant to testify. He pleaded down to a misdemeanor and received a $1,000 fine. A $3 million civil suit resulted from the incident, but the case never made it to a court.

In December 1985, Paycheck was convicted and sentenced to seven years in jail for shooting a man at the North High Lounge in Hillsboro, Ohio; he had fired a .22 pistol, and the bullet grazed the man&#x27;s head. Paycheck claimed the act was self-defense. After several years spent fighting the sentence, he began serving his sentence in 1989, spending 22 months in prison before being pardoned by Ohio Governor Richard Celeste.

In 1990, he filed for bankruptcy after tax problems with the Internal Revenue Service, including a $300,000 lien.

=== Health issues and death ===
Although Paycheck was addicted to drugs and alcohol during his career, he later was said to have &quot;put his life in order&quot; after his prison stay.

After 2000, his health would only allow for short appearances. Contracting emphysema and asthma after a lengthy illness, Paycheck died at Nashville&#x27;s Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 2003, aged 64. He was survived by his son Jonathan Paycheck.

He was buried in Woodlawn Memorial Park in Nashville; reportedly the plot was paid for by George Jones. Among the two-hundred-some attendees at Paycheck’s memorial were Jones, Little Jimmy Dickens, and a sizable grouping contingent of Hell&#x27;s Angels, admirers of the hard-living Paycheck. &quot;By and large, it was the roughest-looking funeral crowd I have ever seen,&quot; the &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; columnist wrote in CMT.

== Legacy ==
A tribute album, &quot;Touch My Heart: a Tribute to Johnny Paycheck&quot;, was released in 2004 on the Sugar Hill Label. Produced by Robbie Fulks, the album features George Jones, Marshall Crenshaw, Hank Williams III, Al Anderson, Dallas Wayne, Neko Case, Gail Davies and Fulks himself covering some of Paycheck&#x27;s best-known songs.
In his song &quot;Grand Ole Opry (Ain&#x27;t So Grand Anymore)&quot;, Hank Williams III praises Paycheck (along with Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, and Hank Williams Jr.) as a &quot;real rebel&quot; the Grand Ole Opry only reluctantly inducted. 

His song &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long (And I&#x27;ll Be Hating You)&quot; appears in the open-world action-adventure video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.

His song &quot;(Pardon Me) I&#x27;ve Got Someone to Kill&quot; is covered on the album &quot;All the Way&quot; by Diamanda Galás.

An episode of Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus features an account of Paycheck&#x27;s life and rise to fame during the Outlaw country movement.

<text>The River Wye (; ) is the fourth-longest river in the UK, stretching some from its source on Plynlimon in mid Wales to the Severn Estuary. The lower reaches of the river forms part of the border between England and Wales. The Wye Valley (lower part) is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Wye is important for nature conservation and recreation, but is affected by pollution.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the river&#x27;s name is not clear. Possibly the earliest reference to the name is &quot;Guoy&quot; in Nennius&#x27; early 9th Century and the modern Welsh name is . The Wye was much later given a Latin name, , an adjective meaning &#x27;wandering&#x27;. The Tithe map references a Vagas Field in both Whitchurch and Chepstow. Philologists such as Edward Lye and Joseph Bosworth in the 18th and early 19th centuries suggested an Old English derivation from , &#x27;wave&#x27;.

==Description==
The source of the Wye is in the Welsh mountains at Plynlimon. It flows through or past several towns and villages, including Rhayader, Builth Wells, Hay-on-Wye, Hereford (the only city on the River Wye), Ross-on-Wye, Symonds Yat, Monmouth and Tintern, meeting the Severn estuary just below Chepstow. The lower of the river from Redbrook to Chepstow form the border between England and Wales.

==Conservation==

The River Wye is protected by two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, one covering the Upper Wye () above Hay-on-Wye, and one covering the Lower Wye () downstream to Chepstow. The criteria for inclusion of the river as an SSSI include geology, topography, flora, mammals, invertebrates, fish and birdlife, as the river and its tributaries constitute a large linear ecosystem. The Lower Wye SSSI is itself divided into seven units of assessment set by Natural England, and administrative responsibilities are shared between the councils of Powys, Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, and Monmouthshire. The Wye abuts a range of other SSSIs in England and Wales, including the Upper Wye Gorge and Lower Wye Gorge.

It is also a Special Area of Conservation and one of the most important rivers in the UK for nature conservation. It is an important migration route and wildlife corridor, as well as a key breeding area for many nationally and internationally important species. The river supports a range of species and habitats covered by European Directives and those listed under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. In Powys the river lies within the Radnorshire Environmentally Sensitive Area. Much of the lower valley is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

===Salmon===
The Lower Wye has been designated as a salmonid fishery under the EC Freshwater Fish Directive.

The Wye was particularly famous for its large &quot;spring&quot; salmon that had spent three or more years at sea before returning to spawn. They used to enter the river between January and June and sometimes reached weights of over , the largest recorded being landed after a long fight by Miss Doreen Davey from the Cowpond Pool at Winforton on 13 March 1923. The last recorded rod-caught salmon from the Wye was taken in 1963 by Donald Parrish and weighed . Since the early 2000s the spring catch has been steadily recovering and salmon of over have been reported every year since 2011.

== Pollution ==
Pollution has severely affected the river; the Wye does not meet European and national standards on river health. This has been happening for some time; a Nutrient Management Board (NMB) was established in 2014 to address the issues. Pollution from chicken and dairy farms has become so bad the Wye has been used as an example of river pollution in the UK on &quot;Countryfile&quot; and in several national newspapers.

This pollution causes algal blooms several times a year with increasing frequency and length, depleting the oxygen in the water causing fish such as brown trout, chub and barbel as well as aquatic invertebrates and plants to suffocate to death. Fish and aquatic invertebrates are the main food source for otters, kingfishers, herons, eels and other protected species.

Along with many other rivers the Wye is being heavily polluted by manure from the 10 million free range chickens for eggs and meat in intensive poultry units (IPUs) in Powys and Herefordshire, contaminating the Wye&#x27;s tributaries. As of April 2020, there were over 110 registered IPUs in Powys, each with over 40,000 birds (smaller IPUs need not be registered).

In addition, runoff from dairy farms, farm slurry and silage liquor are entering the Wye. A study by the Welsh Government found that only 1% of farm slurry stores in Wales met regulations and that farms were purposely spreading slurry on fields before high rainfall, leading to increased run off into waterways. An investigation by Greenpeace found that Environment Agency staff cuts from austerity had reduced pollution inspections by up to one third. An internal report by the Environment Agency showed that the use of a “voluntary approach” by government was leading to increased levels of river pollution across the UK. Powys County Council approved the construction of 20 new free-range chicken sheds in 2019 and as of February 2022 continues to license new chicken farms. In addition to problems with the riverine environment, this is causing air quality issues. Pollution from the chicken factory farms is estimated to have killed 90% to 97% of the river’s water crowfoot beds, and more phosphate than plants can absorb is released in the River Wye&#x27;s catchment every year.

In February 2022, it was declared at a meeting of the River Wye Nutrient Management Board thatIn March 2023, a High Court claim was brought against the Environment Agency by environmental charity River Action for failing to take action to protect the Wye from environmental pollution, after a Lancaster University study found that 60-70% of phosphates in the river come from agriculture.

==History==

The Romans constructed a bridge of wood and stone just upstream of present-day Chepstow, some remains of which were found in the river bed during an archaeological dig in 1911. The River Wye is tidal from its junction with the River Severn for about to Bigsweir, where a band of hard rock forms a natural weir across the river. The tidal range on this lower section is huge, with water levels rising by up to on some spring tides, but despite the risks of navigating such a river, it has been used since Roman times to transport coal from the Forest of Dean, cider from Hereford, together with Italian wine, iron, stone and timber.

When compared to many of the long rivers in Britain, the Wye is quite steep, with a rise of 1.93 feet per mile (0.365 m per km) between its junction with the River Severn and Monmouth, and a rise of 2.4 feet per mile (0.455 m per km) between there and Hereford. In the summer months, the river level at Hereford is above ordnance datum (AOD), and Hereford is about from the river mouth. For navigation to occur, some form of management of river levels was required. Early records are fragmentary, but it appears that the river was used to transport iron from the Forest of Dean for Edward the Confessor&#x27;s ships in the 11th century, and in 1171 and 1172, iron was supplied to Henry II for his invasion of Ireland. From the 13th century, the records are clearer, and iron from forges at Bicknor, Lydbrook, Monmouth and Carey Mills was transported by river. During the reign of Edward I, a common right of navigation on the Wye was recorded, with the channel to be kept free of weirs and other obstructions. Where these already existed, they were to be demolished at the owner&#x27;s expense. Documents from 1561 and 1571 concerning water mills and weirs show that the river was used for navigation at the time.

In 1622, a petition was raised by the counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, together with the city of Hereford, that the river should be cleared of obstructions that made fishing and navigation difficult. A commission of sewers was appointed, but seems to have done very little, since most of the weirs belonged to the king. There were seven weirs on the river in 1641, to provide water power for mills and forges. During Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth period, proposals were made to improve the river for navigation by building flash locks at the weirs, and dredging the channel to make it deeper. Although there were arguments for and against the proposals, Sir William Sandys was appointed in 1662 to oversee making the Wye and the River Lugg navigable. He had previously worked on the Warwickshire Avon to make that navigable. Some £1,300 had already been raised in the country, but it is unclear what he did with the money. He was assisted by Henry and Windsor Sandys, and they were given powers to construct a towing path, wide on both sides of the river, to allow boats to be hauled upstream. Although tolls could be charged, they also had to maintain the right of free passage which was long established on the river. Twenty Commissioners were appointed, ten from Hereford, five from Gloucester and five from Hereford. All weirs were to include an opening, so that salmon and other fish could migrate along the river.

The scheme involved the construction of flash locks in channels cut to bypass the weirs, a system which Sandys had used with success on the Avon, but the Wye was a much faster flowing river, which meant that the solution was impracticable and very costly. It had been abandoned by 1668, as maintenance costs made the operation of boats unprofitable, and a new scheme, proposed by Lord Coningsby of Hampton Court, Herefordshire was to be implemented. All fishing weirs and mill weirs would be bought and demolished, while Sandys locks would be abandoned. The river bed would also be deepened where necessary. The cost of buying the weirs would be raised by a tax on the county, and it was estimated that the river would be navigable for about 200 days per year. At the time there were weirs supplying six fulling mills and three corn mills at Hereford, and another nine elsewhere, at Fownhope, Hancox, Carey, Foy and Wilton. There were another nine derelict weirs above Monmouth, and five below the town.


Lord Coningsby&#x27;s proposals were enshrined in an act of Parliament, the &#x27; (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 14), which authorised the County of Hereford to buy up and demolish the mills on the Wye and Lugg. All locks and weirs were to be removed, except that at New Weir forge below Goodrich, which survived until about 1815. By 1727, around £18,000 had been raised to carry out the work, and thirteen weirs in Herefordshire had been bought and removed. Some work had also been carried out on the Lugg, but much of it was damaged by flooding soon afterwards. One unexpected consequence of removing the weirs was that water levels dropped, resulting in there being a number of shoals that boats now had to negotiate. Another act of Parliament was obtained, the &#x27; (13 Geo. 1. c. 34), which appointed new trustees, and allowed them to authorise the construction of mills and weirs at locations which would assist navigation. In 1763, James Taylor proposed the construction of 22 weirs, each with an associated pound lock, to make the river fully navigable, but the scheme was not implemented. When it looked likely that the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal would not reach Hereford, there were calls to further improve the Wye. At the time, boats were hauled by gangs of ten or eleven men, but men were in short supply, and a towing path for horses was suggested. William Jessop carried out a survey, and the towing path was authorised by the (49 Geo. 3. c. lxxviii). A company was formed to build of path from Lydbrook to Hereford, and to maintain ferries at five points where the path crossed from one side of the river to the other.

Evidence given in Parliament during the passage of the bill stated that some 10,000 tons of coal were moved along the river to Hereford each year, with 3,000 tons of other commodities. Another 4,000 tons of lime and other goods were delivered to various points along the river. Progress on the project was rapid, and local newspapers announced the arrival of two barges in Hereford on 23 January 1811, each towed by two horses. Carriage of coal to Hereford became easier following the opening of the Severn and Wye Tramroad in 1813, which brought coal to the river bank at Bishop&#x27;s Wood. A steam tug was trialled on the river in 1825, but although it proved to be successful, it was sold due to the difficulty of finding suitable barges for it to tow. Passenger services became a feature of the river from 1835, with boats running between Ross, Monmouth and Chepstow, later extended to include Goodrich and Tintern.
The river was also navigable above Hereford, as far as Hay-on-Wye, although only when there was sufficient water, and a system of ropes and pulleys were used to allow boats to negotiate the rapids at Monnington.
Money was spent several times improving the River Lugg from Leominster to its confluence with the Wye at Mordiford, but its navigation is likely to have been difficult. The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal reached Hereford in 1845, providing an alternative way to supply the town with coal, and trade tailed off with the opening of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway in 1854, and the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway in the following year. After the Wye Valley Railway opened in 1876, the river ceased to be navigable above Brockweir, and as the river silted up, Tintern became the normal upper limit for navigation. The river is still used by pleasure craft.

The river was unusual in that it was a Free Navigation from its source to Hay-on-Wye, a distance of . It ceased to be free after the modifications by Sandys in the 17th century, but this right was re-established by the 1695 act, which stated:
Therefore be it enacted that the rivers Wye and Lugg may be henceforth accounted, deemed and taken to be free and common rivers for all to make use of for carrying and conveying of all passenger goods, wares and commodities by boats, barges, lighters and other vessels whatsoever.
The National Rivers Authority brought a case before the High Court in 1995, to enable them to impose bylaws on the river. Shortly afterwards, they were replaced by the Environment Agency, and in 2002, the (SI 2002/1998) was enacted. This confirmed the right of navigation on both the Wye and the Lugg, but established the Environment Agency as the navigation authority for the rivers. It also banned the construction of locks and weirs, so neither river is likely to be navigable by motor boats under normal circumstances. Despite this, in 1989, Frank Barton and Pat Hucket successfully navigated a 230-ton barge up the river to Hereford. Travelling time on the river was 20 hours, but this was spread over six months, as they had to wait for just the right water levels. The vessel was renamed &quot;Wye Invader&quot; during the journey. In March 2019, Barton returned to the river, navigating a narrowboat called &quot;Wye Invader Two&quot; from Sharpness to Monmouth Rowing Club and back again. The trip was possible because there was about of flood water in the river, enabling the boat to pass over the weirs and obstructions.

==Navigation and sport==

The Environment Agency is the navigation authority for the river. The normal tidal limit (NTL) of the river is Bigsweir and navigation below this point is under the control of the Gloucester Harbour Trustees as Competent Harbour Authority. There is a public right of navigation up to Hay-on-Wye, and canoes are generally permitted on the next up to Glasbury, so long as they do not disturb anglers.
The River Wye provides for canoeing and kayaking as it has sections suitable for all ranges of skills and free access all the way downstream from Hay to Hereford and Monmouth, and the tidal Wye to Chepstow and the Severn Estuary. There are a wide range of canoe hire and supervised trips, as well as campsites at key points on the river. Symonds Yat has a particularly popular series of rapids that was purchased by the British Canoe Union in 2003 to preserve the rapids for recreational use, canoe trips through the rapids stop next at Monmouth. There are three rowing clubs on the river at Hereford, Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth. Annual regattas are held at Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth for rowers and scullers of all abilities, next to the local rowing club. In 2017 more than 600 people took to the River Wye in inflatables ranging from dinghies to paddling pools during the event WYE FLOAT, opened by former Olympic ski jumper Eddie the Eagle.

Walkers can take the Wye Valley Walk which follows the route of the River Wye from Coed Hafren, near Plynlimon, to Chepstow along a series of well-maintained way-marked paths. A viewpoint near The Biblins on the Wye is known as &#x27;Three Counties View&#x27;, the meeting place of the counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire.

==Tributaries==
The Wye&#x27;s tributaries include the river Lugg, Elan, Dulas, Irfon, Marteg, Monnow, Trothy, Ithon, Llynfi, Letton Lake, Tarennig (the Wye&#x27;s first tributary) and Bidno. A fuller list is available at the relevant section of the list of rivers of Wales

== 2020 floods ==
In February 2020, Wales and parts of England endured extremely heavy rainfall from Storm Dennis, following shortly after Storm Ciara. The central part of South Wales was particularly affected. The river over-topped its banks and caused flooding in several areas, including Hay-on-Wye, Hereford, Ross-on-Wye and Monmouth. Much of Hereford was flooded, with homes inundated. Churches and leisure centres were opened to accommodate evacuated residents. The river at Monmouth reached its highest level ever recorded.

== 2021 floods ==
In January 2021, the Wye catchment suffered flooding as a result of Storm Christoph.

==Cultural references==

The Romantic poet William Wordsworth includes an apostrophe to the Wye in his famous poem &quot;Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey&quot;, published in 1798 in &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;:

How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,&lt;br&gt;
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro&#x27; the woods,&lt;br&gt;
How often has my spirit turned to thee!
Nelson travelled down the Wye in 1802, along with Lady Hamilton and her husband, Sir William Hamilton. They sailed from Ross-on-Wye to Monmouth, to be greeted by a cannonade and the band of the Monmouthshire Militia playing See, the Conquering Hero Comes. Nelson expressed surprise that he was known at &quot;such a little gut of a river as the Wye&quot;.

<text>The Battle of the Thames , also known as the Battle of Moraviantown, was an American victory in the War of 1812 against Tecumseh&#x27;s Confederacy and their British allies. It took place on October 5, 1813, in Upper Canada, near Chatham. The British lost control of Southwestern Ontario as a result of the battle; Tecumseh was killed, and his confederacy largely fell apart.

British troops under Major General Henry Procter had occupied Detroit until the United States Navy gained control of Lake Erie, cutting them off from their supplies. Procter was forced to retreat north up the Thames River to Moraviantown, followed by the tribal confederacy under Shawnee leader Tecumseh who were his allies.

American infantry and cavalry under Major General William Henry Harrison drove off the British and then defeated the Indigenous peoples, who were demoralized by the death of Tecumseh in action. American control was re-established in the Detroit area, the tribal confederacy collapsed, and Procter was court-martialed for his poor leadership.

==Background==
The American Army of the Northwest under Major General William Henry Harrison was attempting to recover Fort Detroit and capture Fort Malden at Amherstburg, Ontario during the last months of 1812 and for much of 1813 from the Right Division of the British Army in Upper Canada, which was commanded by Major General Henry Procter. The British position depended on maintaining command of Lake Erie, as the sparsely populated region produced insufficient crops and cattle to feed Procter&#x27;s troops, the sailors of the British ships on the lake, and the large number of Indians and their families gathered at Amherstburg under Tecumseh. 

Supplies could effectively be brought to them only by water, usually from Long Point near the eastern end of Lake Erie. If naval command of Lake Erie passed to the Americans, they would be able to land an army on the north shore, cutting off Procter from reinforcement from the east.

British armed vessels had maintained control of the lake from the start of the war to the end of July 1813. The United States Navy was constructing its own squadron at Presque Isle Bay commanded by Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry. During July, the British under Commander Robert Heriot Barclay kept the Americans pinned down in Presque Isle, but they had to lift the blockade for two days in order to receive supplies. 

Perry was able to move his ships across the sandbar at the entrance to the harbor and into the lake, and Barclay failed to attack them. Perry&#x27;s superior squadron instituted a counter-blockade of Amherstburg as soon as his vessels were armed and manned, and supplies of food rapidly ran short.

With supplies almost exhausted, Barclay put out to seek battle with Perry on September 10, but Perry gained a complete victory in the Battle of Lake Erie. Perry hastily wrote a note to General Harrison stating: &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours&quot;. Harrison knew that Procter would be forced to retreat, so he ordered an advance. One thousand mounted troops began advancing along the lake shore to Detroit, and 2,500 foot soldiers were carried there and to Amherstburg by Perry&#x27;s ships once they had repaired any damage received during the battle.

===Procter&#x27;s retreat===
Procter had made preparations to fall back to the British position at Burlington Heights at the western end of Lake Ontario even before he received news of Barclay&#x27;s defeat, and Tecumseh knew that this would remove all protection from the confederation tribes whose lands lay to the west of Detroit. He attempted to dissuade Procter:

Our fleet has gone out, we know they have fought; we have heard the great guns but know nothing of what has happened to our Father with one Arm [&quot;Barclay had lost an arm in 1809&quot;]. Our ships have gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our Father [&quot;Proctor&quot;] tying up everything and preparing to run the other, without letting his red children know what his intentions are... We must compare our Father&#x27;s conduct to a fat animal that carries its tail upon its back; but when affrighted, it drops it between its legs and runs off.

Nevertheless, Procter could not defend Fort Amherstburg, as there was no food and the guns had been removed from the fort to be mounted on Barclay&#x27;s ships. He began to retreat up the Thames River on September 27. Tecumseh had no option but to go with him. Procter apparently agreed to a compromise to retreat only as far as Moraviantown, a settlement of Lenape Indians who had migrated from the United States. This was the highest navigable point of the river, so it was safe from outflanking moves by water. Also, some supplies could be brought there overland from Burlington Heights, although the roads were very poor. However, Procter made no attempt to fortify this position.

The British retreat was badly managed, and the soldiers had been reduced to half rations. Procter allegedly left the main body of his army under command of Colonel Augustus Warburton of the 41st Regiment, without orders, while he led the retreat accompanied by his wife and family, the other women and dependents, and his personal baggage. The British soldiers were becoming increasingly demoralized, and Tecumseh&#x27;s warriors grew ever more impatient with Procter for his unwillingness to stop and fight.

The Americans left a brigade under Duncan McArthur to garrison Detroit and another under Lewis Cass to garrison Sandwich, Ontario. Harrison led the main body from Sandwich in pursuit of Procter on October 2. As they advanced, Harrison&#x27;s men captured several abandoned boats and a steady stream of British stragglers. They caught up with the retreating British and Indians late on October 4. Tecumseh skirmished with the Americans near Chatham, Ontario to slow their advance, but the Indians were quickly overwhelmed. The boats carrying Warburton&#x27;s reserve ammunition and the last of the food ran aground and were left behind to be captured by an American raiding party.

==Forces==

William Henry Harrison&#x27;s force numbered at least 3,500 infantry and cavalry. He had a small detachment of regulars from the 27th U.S. Infantry and five brigades of Kentucky militia led by Isaac Shelby, the 63 year-old governor of Kentucky and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. He had 1,000 volunteer cavalry under Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson. Most of Johnson&#x27;s men were from Kentucky, but some were from the River Raisin area of Michigan, all of them spurred on by the slogan &quot;Remember the River Raisin.&quot;

Procter had about 800 soldiers, mainly from the 41st Regiment. The veterans of the regiment&#x27;s 1st Battalion had been serving in Canada since 1803 and had suffered heavy casualties in several engagements in 1813, including the Battle of Lake Erie, where more than 150 of its men had served aboard Barclay&#x27;s ships. They had been reinforced by the young soldiers of the 2nd Battalion. Most of the regiment&#x27;s officers were dissatisfied with Procter&#x27;s leadership, but Colonel Warburton, the next in seniority, refused to countenance any move to remove him from command. Tecumseh led about 500 Indians.

==Battle==

Procter ordered his troops to abandon their half-cooked breakfast and retreat a further two miles shortly after daybreak on October 5, then formed them into line of battle with a single 6-pounder cannon. He planned to trap Harrison on the banks of the Thames, driving the Americans off the road with cannon fire, but he had made no attempt to fortify the position by creating abatis or throwing up earthworks, and the ground presented no obstacle to the American horsemen, while scattered trees masked the British fire. Tecumseh&#x27;s men formed a line in a black ash swamp on the British right to flank the Americans. Tecumseh rode along the British line, shaking hands with each officer before rejoining his warriors.

General Harrison surveyed the battlefield and ordered James Johnson (brother of Col. Johnson) to make a frontal attack on the British regulars with his mounted riflemen. Despite the Indians&#x27; flanking fire, Johnson&#x27;s Kentuckians broke through, the British cannon not having fired. The exhausted, dispirited, and half-starved British regulars fired a single ragged fusillade before retreating in disorder. 

Procter and about 250 of his men fled from the battlefield, while the rest of his soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered. Most of the British soldiers, including Lieutenant Richard Bullock&#x27;s grenadier company, who escaped the battlefield were on the right of the British line, where the ground was marshy and more thickly wooded.
Tecumseh and his followers remained and carried on fighting. Col. Johnson charged into the Indian position at the head of about 20 horsemen to draw attention away from the main American force, but Tecumseh and his men answered with a volley of musket fire that stopped the cavalry charge. Fifteen of Johnson&#x27;s men were killed or wounded, Johnson himself was hit five times, and his main force became bogged down in the swamp mud. Tecumseh is believed to have been killed during this fighting.

The main force made its way through the swamp, and James Johnson&#x27;s troops were freed from their attack on the British. The American reinforcements were converging as news spread of the death of Tecumseh, and Indian resistance dissolved. Richard Mentor Johnson was credited with shooting Tecumseh, though the evidence is unclear. William Whitley, a Revolutionary War veteran, is also credited with killing him. Lawyer and one-armed marksman James A Drain Sr., in his autobiography &quot;Single Handed&quot; (1927), wrote of hearing from Whitley&#x27;s granddaughter the family tradition that Whitley and Tecumseh killed each other simultaneously.

==Casualties==

Harrison reported that the British regulars had 72 killed and 22 wounded prisoners. Lieutenant Richard Bullock of the 41st Regiment, however, said that there were 12 killed and 36 wounded prisoners. More than a year after the battle, British Colonel Augustus Warburton and Lieutenant Colonel William Evans both reported that 18 were killed and 25 wounded. Harrison reported 601 British troops captured, a figure that included the prisoners taken during the retreat leading up to the battle and stragglers captured after it.

The Indians recorded their own casualties as 16 killed, including Tecumseh, although Harrison claimed that 33 dead Indians were found in the woods after the battle. General Procter wrote in a letter dated October 23, 1813, &quot;The Indian cause and ours experienced a serious loss in the death of Round Head.&quot; American soldiers scalped and skinned some of the dead Indians in order to acquire souvenirs.

There are conflicting versions of the American loss in the battle. Harrison stated that 7 were killed outright, 5 died of wounds, and 17 more were wounded. Major General Isaac Shelby said that 7 or 8 were killed outright, 4 died of their wounds, and about 20 more were wounded. Participant Robert McAfee gave 10 killed and 35 wounded, while Peter Trisler Jr. said that there were 14 killed and 20 wounded.

Brown states that there were 25 killed or fatally injured and 50 wounded in Johnson&#x27;s regiment, and 2 killed and 6–7 wounded in the infantry, for a total of 27 killed and 56 or 57 wounded. Harrison informed Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr. that the only casualties inflicted by the British were three men wounded; all of the rest were caused by the Indians.

==Aftermath==

The enlistments were about to expire for the militia component of Harrison&#x27;s army, so the Americans retired to Detroit.

The American victory led to re-established American control over the Northwest frontier, and the Detroit area remained comparatively quiet for the rest of the war, apart from skirmishes such as the Battle of Longwoods and an American mounted raid near the end of 1814 which resulted in the Battle of Malcolm&#x27;s Mills. American victory at the Thames failed to translate into recapture of Illinois, Wisconsin, and other Midwestern territories, which the British and Indians held until the war&#x27;s end; efforts also failed to regain control of the Old Northwest and of fur trade routes after the British victory at the subsequent Engagements on Lake Huron.

The death of Tecumseh was a crushing blow to the Indian alliance which he created, and it dissolved following the battle. Harrison signed an armistice at Detroit with the chiefs or representatives of several tribes, although others fought on until the end of the war and beyond. He then transferred most of his regulars east to the Niagara River and went himself to Washington where he was acclaimed a hero. However, a comparatively petty dispute with President James Madison and John Armstrong resulted in him resigning his commission as major general. Harrison&#x27;s popularity grew, and he was eventually elected president. Richard Mentor Johnson eventually became vice president to President Martin Van Buren, based partly on the belief that he had personally killed Tecumseh.

A few days after the battle, Procter rallied 246 men of the 41st Regiment at the Grand River, reinforced by some young soldiers of the 2nd battalion who had not been present at the battle. The two battalions were reorganized and merged, as the regiment was severely understrength at this point, and the survivors of the 1st Battalion were placed in the grenadier and light infantry companies. The soldiers of the 41st who were taken prisoner at Moraviantown and the Battle of Lake Erie were exchanged or released towards the end of 1814. They had been held in encampments near Sandusky, Ohio, and had suffered severely from sickness during their captivity.

In May 1814, Procter was charged with negligence and improper conduct, though a court martial could not be held until December, when campaigning had ceased for the winter and a senior board of officers could be assembled. They judged that Procter had managed the retreat badly, failing to secure his stores, and also disposed the troops ineffectively at Moraviantown. He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and pay for six months.

==Legacy==
Three modern battalions of the United States Army perpetuate the lineage of the old 27th Infantry Regiment, elements of which were at the Battle of the Thames.

<doc id="249103" wikidata="Q90238" url="?curid=249103" title="George Meredith">
<text>George Meredith (12 February 1828 – 18 May 1909) was an English novelist and poet of the Victorian era. At first, his focus was poetry, influenced by John Keats among others, but Meredith gradually established a reputation as a novelist. &quot;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel&quot; (1859) briefly scandalised Victorian literary circles. Of his later novels, the most enduring is &quot;The Egoist&quot; (1879), though in his lifetime his greatest success was &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot; (1885). His novels were innovative in their attention to characters&#x27; psychology, and also portrayed social change. His style, in both poetry and prose, was noted for its syntactic complexity; Oscar Wilde likened it to &quot;chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning&quot;. Meredith was an encourager of other novelists, as well as an influence on them; among those to benefit were Robert Louis Stevenson and George Gissing. Meredith was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.

== Life ==
=== Early years, education and first marriage ===
Meredith was born at 73 High Street, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, the only child of Augustus Urmston Meredith and his wife Jane Eliza (née Macnamara). The name Meredith is Welsh, and he would describe himself as &quot;half Irish and half Welsh&quot; (on his mother&#x27;s and father&#x27;s sides, respectively). He was proud of his Welsh origins, and such pride is evident in his novels. His biographer Lionel Stevenson explains that Meredith&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Melchizedek, would sometimes &quot;boast eloquently of his princely forebears&quot;, but &quot;between his immediate forebears and the legendary Welsh princes of seven centuries before, the history of the family remains obscure.&quot;

Augustus Meredith was, as Melchizedek Meredith had been before him, a naval outfitter, and among his employees was James Watson Gieve. Jane died when her son was five, and the outfitting business failed, with Augustus declared bankrupt in November 1838. He moved to London and in July 1839 remarried – his second wife being the family&#x27;s former housekeeper, Matilda Buckett.

George Meredith was educated in Southsea until 1840, when a legacy from his mother&#x27;s sister, Anna, made it possible for him to attend a boarding school in Lowestoft, Suffolk. In August 1842 he was sent to the Moravian School in Neuwied, near Coblenz, where he remained until the spring of 1844; Lionel Stevenson argues that the experience instilled his &quot;impatience towards sham and servility, contempt for conceit, admiration for courage, and devotion to candid and rational forthrightness&quot;.

By 1845 it was planned that he would be articled to a solicitor, Richard Charnock of Paternoster Row, and he was duly articled in February 1846, shortly before his eighteenth birthday. But he abandoned the legal profession for journalism and poetry, taking lodgings in Pimlico.

Drawn to literary circles, Meredith collaborated with Edward Gryffydh Peacock, son of Thomas Love Peacock, in publishing a privately circulated literary magazine, the &quot;Monthly Observer&quot;. One of the contributors was Edward Peacock&#x27;s sister Mary Ellen Nicolls. Described by the artist William Holman Hunt as &quot;a dashing type of horsewoman who attracted much notice&quot;, Mary was the widow of a naval officer, Lieutenant Edward Nicolls, who in 1844 had drowned while attempting to rescue a man under his command.

In August 1849 Meredith married Mary, at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. At the time of the marriage, Meredith was 21 years old; she was 28 and had a five-year-old daughter by Lieutenant Nicolls (born after his death). Augustus Meredith was not present at the wedding, having emigrated to South Africa in April of that year.

=== First books ===
Meredith collected his early writings, first published in periodicals, in an 1851 volume, &quot;Poems&quot;. Dedicated to his father-in-law Thomas Love Peacock, &quot;with the profound admiration and affectionate respect of his son-in-law&quot;, it attracted the interest of Tennyson, who wrote Meredith an admiring letter, expressing the desire to meet, though their first encounter was awkward and left Meredith convinced of the elder poet&#x27;s &quot;conceit&quot;. A review by William Michael Rossetti likened Meredith to &quot;a kind of limited Keats&quot;, &quot;a seeing or sensuous poet&quot; possessing &quot;warmth of emotion&quot;.

The Merediths&#x27; circumstances were precarious, and Mary had more than one miscarriage before in 1853 giving birth to a son, Arthur Gryffydh. At the time the couple were living with her father in Lower Halliford (today part of Shepperton). Following the birth, Peacock rented a house for them, across the village green from his home.

Fatherhood heightened Meredith&#x27;s belief that he must press ahead with his writing career, resulting in what would eventually be his first substantial work of prose fiction, &quot;The Shaving of Shagpat&quot;. An allegorical Arabian fantasy, it was written in imitation of &quot;the style and manner of the Oriental story-tellers&quot;, but sprang &quot;from no Eastern source&quot;. The book attracted little notice when published, in 1856, though it was praised by George Eliot for its &quot;poetical genius&quot;. The following year he published &quot;Farina&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Legend of Cologne&quot;, a work in the comic-grotesque vein that was described by &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;&#x27;s critic as &quot;a full-blooded specimen of the nonsense of Genius&quot; and a &quot;lively, audacious piece of extravaganza&quot;. George Eliot, in &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;, called it &quot;an original and an entertaining book&quot;, but it inevitably suffered from her reviewing it alongside &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;.

=== End of first marriage ===
&quot;The Death of Chatterton&quot;, a notable painting by the English Pre-Raphaelite painter Henry Wallis (1830–1916), for which Meredith served as the model, was exhibited in 1856. Mary and Wallis grew close and became lovers. In 1857, she fell pregnant to him and in April 1858 gave birth to a son, Harold, who was later known as Felix Wallis. The relationship with Wallis however did not last; having spent some of 1858 with him in Capri, she returned to England with Harold, and from then on moved frequently. She died three years later, of kidney failure, a few months after moving to Grotto Cottage, Oatlands Park, Weybridge. Meredith was by this time living in Chelsea, where he kept rooms in Hobury Street and often had Arthur in his care. He did not attend Mary&#x27;s funeral; neither did Henry Wallis or her father.

Meredith&#x27;s first major novel, &quot;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel&quot;, emerged from his experience of the collapse of his marriage and shocked many readers with its sexual frankness. His collection of fifty sonnets entitled &quot;Modern Love&quot; (1862) also traces the decline of a marriage and has been described by Dorothy Mermin as &quot;a curiosity of Victorian literature&quot; and &quot;a point of intersection between Victorian poetry and the Victorian novel&quot;; &quot;in a very real sense novelistic&quot;, it is notable for its &quot;psychological realism&quot; and &quot;extreme subjectivity&quot;.

In 1861 he published &quot;Evan Harrington&quot;, a novel which deals with class, manners and mimicry. It upset his father, living at the time in Cape Town, who complained: &quot;I am pained beyond expression, as I consider it aimed at myself.&quot; The novel, according to the critic Richard Cronin, &quot;recklessly betrays family confidences&quot; and constituted a &quot;treacherous burlesque of his own family&#x27;s history, but also ... [a] love letter to his family&quot;.

=== Second marriage ===
In 1863, Meredith met Marie Vulliamy, a young woman of Anglo-French stock whose father, Justin, was the successful, recently retired proprietor of a wool business in Normandy. Attraction was immediate, and by 1864 Meredith was writing to his friend Frederick Maxse that &quot;She has done me the honour to love me for some time&quot;. But from Mr Vulliamy&#x27;s perspective, the 36-year-old Meredith, a widower with an 11-year-old son, was not the ideal suitor for his 24-year-old daughter, and Meredith had to provide character references, among whom were Edward Peacock, Sir Alexander Duff-Gordon and John Chapman.

Mr Vulliamy was especially keen to understand the details of Meredith&#x27;s previous marriage, to establish both his character and standing. In the end, his investigations &quot;revealed nothing really discreditable, and though the financial outlook was not bright, it was not, with the £200 per annum that he would settle upon Marie, altogether dark. And outweighing all objections was the simple fact that his daughter was in love with Meredith. The only possible answer was yes, and he gave it.&quot; The couple duly married in September 1864 and settled in Surrey, first in Norbiton and then, at the end of 1867, at Flint Cottage near Box Hill.

=== Development of literary career ===
Meredith continued to write poetry, often inspired by nature, but his most notable publications following his second marriage were novels. &quot;Emilia in England&quot; (1864) was a comedy at the expense of English social climbers. &quot;Rhoda Fleming&quot; (1865), which bore a resemblance to George Eliot&#x27;s novels, portrayed a country girl seduced by a callous gentleman. &quot;Vittoria&quot; (1867) was a sequel of sorts to &quot;Emilia in England&quot;, though not comic. None of these met with success, but he gained more recognition with &quot;The Adventures of Harry Richmond&quot; (1871) and the politically charged &quot;Beauchamp&#x27;s Career&quot; (1876). Three novellas followed: &quot;The House on the Beach&quot; (1877), &quot;The Case of General Ople and Lady Camper&quot; (also 1877), and &quot;The Tale of Chloe&quot; (1879).

He also attempted to complete a play, entitled &quot;The Sentimentalists&quot;, which he had begun in 1862. He would never finish it, but after his death J. M. Barrie chose to weave together the various drafts to create a one-act comedy. This was performed alongside two short pieces of Barrie&#x27;s during a season of work at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 1910 – a project driven by Harley Granville-Barker.

Meredith&#x27;s keen understanding of comedy was articulated in his &quot;Essay on Comedy&quot; (1877). Originally delivered as a lecture at the London Institution, it remains a reference work in the history of comic theory, having influenced analysts of comedy such as Joseph Wood Krutch. The essay was in effect preparation for &quot;The Egoist&quot;, published in 1879, which applies some of his theories, in particular his idea of comedy as &quot;the ultimate civiliser&quot;. He followed it with &quot;The Tragic Comedians&quot; (1880), which was written quickly and without great conviction.

Popular success did not come easily to Meredith. &quot;The Egoist&quot; was a turning point inasmuch it brought him widespread critical recognition. One of several of his works which highlight the subjugation of women during the Victorian period, it was considered by W. E. Henley, who reviewed it in at least four publications and possibly as many as seven, to make him &quot;a companion for Balzac and Richardson, an intimate for Fielding and Cervantes&quot;. The critic for the &quot;New Quarterly Magazine&quot; commented, &quot;We pay Mr Meredith a high compliment when we say he enables the reader to understand what is meant by Comedy, in the best and fullest sense of the word.&quot;

His most commercially rewarding novel was &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot;, published in 1885, which attracted notice because of its relationship to real-life events involving Caroline Norton and Lord Melbourne. Margaret Harris explains that &quot;like many of Meredith&#x27;s novels, &quot;Diana&quot; contains commentary on the aims and techniques of fiction, made particularly potent by Diana&#x27;s being herself a novelist dedicated to &#x27;reading the inner as well as exhibiting the outer&#x27;&quot;. George Gissing wrote to his brother, &quot;By hook or crook, get hold of &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot;. The book is right glorious. Shakespeare in modern English&quot;, and William Cosmo Monkhouse wrote in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; that &quot;amongst all his intellectual and literary feats, Mr Meredith has, perhaps, never accomplished one more striking&quot;. &quot;Diana&quot; was his first book to make an impression in America.
=== Influence in literary circles ===
Meredith supplemented his often uncertain writer&#x27;s income with a job as a publisher&#x27;s reader. His advice to Chapman &amp; Hall made him influential in the world of letters, and he was capable of reading as many as ten manuscripts a week, though his judgement was not always reliable; Ellen Wood&#x27;s novel &quot;East Lynne&quot; was rejected by Chapman &amp; Hall on his say-so yet went on, when published by Richard Bentley, to be a bestseller.

His friends in the literary world included, at different times, William and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Cotter Morison, Leslie Stephen, Robert Louis Stevenson, George Gissing and J. M. Barrie.

Gissing wrote in a letter to his brother Algernon that Meredith&#x27;s novels were &quot;of the superlatively tough species&quot;. His contemporary Sir Arthur Conan Doyle paid tribute to him in the short story &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot;, in which Sherlock Holmes says to Dr. Watson, during the discussion of the case, &quot;And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.&quot; Oscar Wilde in &quot;The Art of Novel-Writing&quot; reflected, &quot;Ah, Meredith! Who can define him? ... As a writer he has mastered everything, except language ... Too strange to be popular, too individual to have imitators, ... [he] stands absolutely alone.&quot;
In 1868 Meredith was introduced to Thomas Hardy by Frederic Chapman of Chapman &amp; Hall. Hardy had submitted his first novel, &quot;The Poor Man and the Lady&quot;. Meredith advised Hardy not to publish his book as it would be attacked by reviewers and destroy his hopes of becoming a novelist. Meredith felt the book was too bitter a satire on the rich, and counselled Hardy to put it aside and write another &quot;with a purely artistic purpose&quot; and more of a plot. Meredith spoke from experience; his own first big novel, &quot;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel&quot;, was judged so shocking that Mudie&#x27;s circulating library had cancelled an order of 300 copies. Hardy continued in his attempts to publish the novel, without success, though he clearly took Meredith&#x27;s advice seriously.

His books were translated into Japanese and influenced author Natsume Sōseki.

=== Politics ===
Meredith&#x27;s politics were those of a Radical Liberal, and he was friends with other Radicals such as Frederick Maxse, whom he met around 1860, and John Morley, whom he first encountered in print, as the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;″s enraptured reviewer of &quot;Evan Harrington&quot;. Another politically active friend was W. T. Stead, who replaced Morley as editor of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and was renowned for his campaigning journalism, in particular a crusade against child prostitution. Stead shared with Meredith an aversion to war, a loathing of the &quot;foul fury of Jingoism&quot; and &quot;jingo-Imperialism&quot; periodically evident in the British press, a hostility to the Russophobia then prevalent in Britain, and an appetite for greater democracy.

=== Later life ===
Beginning in the 1880s, Meredith&#x27;s interest in writing poetry intensified again, and he was of the opinion that his poems would prove more durable than his prose. In 1883 he published &quot;Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth&quot;, which contained substantial new pieces such as &quot;Melampus&quot;, &quot;The Day of the Daughter of Hades&quot;, &quot;Earth and Man&quot; and &quot;The Woods of Westermain&quot;, along with pieces that had previously appeared in periodicals, including &quot;The Lark Ascending&quot; and an expanded version of his earlier &quot;Love in the Valley&quot;. Admirers of the volumes included Alice Meynell, W. P. Ker and Mark Pattison. &quot;Ballads and Poems of Tragic Life&quot; (1887) brought together many of his previously uncollected poems. Its poor reception, especially by W. E. Henley, cemented Meredith&#x27;s belief that there was a critical conspiracy against him.

Nine of his novels were republished in 1885–6, priced at six shillings each, which made them accessible to a wider audience, and from 1889 they appeared in an edition priced 3s. 6d.. Meredith was moved to joke to James Payn, editor of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot;, that his &quot;submerged head [was] strangely appearing above the waters in England&quot;.

He continued to publish new novels, including &quot;One of our Conquerors&quot; (1891), an experimental portrait of a troubled marriage, and &quot;Lord Ormont and his Aminta&quot; (1894), which depicts a woman breaking free from a humiliating marriage and re-establishing her self-worth through a new relationship. The latter contains a sketch of a school that resembles the one he attended in Neuwied. &quot;The Amazing Marriage&quot; (1895), melodramatic yet closely concerned with modern questions of psychology and gender, was the last of his novels to be published in his lifetime; &quot;Celt and Saxon&quot;, an unfinished early work which took a keen interest in the relationship between race and ideology, appeared posthumously in 1910.

Marie died of throat cancer in 1885, lauded by Meredith as &quot;the most unpretending, brave and steadfast friend ever given for a mate&quot;. In later life he was troubled by ailments which restricted his mobility. Explanations for this have included locomotor ataxia and osteoarthritis.

Before his death, Meredith was honoured from many quarters: in 1892 he succeeded Tennyson as president of the Society of Authors; that year there was an honorary doctorate from the University of St Andrews; and at a dinner in his honour in 1895 Thomas Hardy and George Gissing paid tribute to his achievements and his influence on them. Max Beerbohm&#x27;s caricature for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, published in 1896 and captioned &quot;Our First Novelist&quot;, was an indication of Meredith&#x27;s standing at that time; Beerbohm thought him, Shakespeare apart, the greatest English literary figure.

In 1905 he was appointed to the Order of Merit, which had recently been established by King Edward VII. He was invested with the Order at Flint Cottage in December of that year, at a small ceremony performed by the King&#x27;s representative, Sir Arthur Ellis.

In 1909, he died at home in Box Hill. His ashes were buried alongside Marie&#x27;s in the cemetery at Dorking, Surrey.

In 1912 Constable &amp; Co. published &quot;Letters of George Meredith&quot; in 2 volumes.

=== Family ===
* Augustus Meredith died in 1876, aged 79, and his second wife Matilda in 1885, aged 67. Both were buried in Southsea, having returned to England from South Africa around 1863. In Augustus&#x27;s final years, George visited him from time to time, though only out of a sense of duty.
* By his two wives, George Meredith had three children, outliving both wives and one child.
* His relationship with Arthur, his son by Mary, was at first affectionate, and they made a memorable trip to the Alps and Venice in 1861. In 1862, Arthur was enrolled at Norwich School, which was run by a friend of Meredith&#x27;s, Augustus Jessopp. Arthur would later be sent to school in Switzerland, before continuing his studies in Stuttgart. For most of Arthur&#x27;s adult life, father and son were estranged. Arthur found work in a linseed warehouse in France, but health problems curtailed this, and he spent several years on Lake Garda, producing a little journalism and attempting to write a book. His health collapsed in 1886, and he relocated to Australia. He died of tuberculosis, not long after returning from Australia, in September 1890.
* With his second wife, Marie, he had two children. Their son, William Maxse (1865–1937), would edit Meredith&#x27;s letters and achieve note in the world of publishing. Their daughter, Marie Eveleen (1871–1933), known as Mariette, married Henry Parkman Sturgis, an American-born banker and politician 24 years her senior, who by his first wife Mary (d. 1886) had six children.
* His stepdaughter Edith Nicolls, later Clarke, for more than 40 years ran The National Training School Of Cookery. A pioneer of what came to be known as &quot;domestic science&quot;, she published several cookbooks and received the MBE. She died in 1926.
* The first biography of Meredith was published in 1920 by Stewart Marsh Ellis, his second cousin.

== Literary style ==
Meredith&#x27;s style has attracted a great deal of comment, both favourable and disapproving.

Early on, critics noted his indebtedness to two writers in particular: Thomas Carlyle and Robert Browning. Stevenson notes that the triad &quot;soon became a critical cliché.&quot; Some critics felt that he was more influenced by the former than the latter, including George Pierce Baker, who asked: &quot;May not Mr. Meredith be called the Carlyle of fiction?&quot;

His novels, far from being action-packed, are instead driven by what he called &quot;action of the mind&quot;, and the large amounts of dialogue have led to their being dismissed as &quot;talky&quot;. Critic Neil Roberts describes &quot;the often irritating but profoundly original world of Meredith&#x27;s novelistic art&quot;, noting that these are two sides of &quot;the sense of the &quot;new&quot;&quot; in his work and that this is &quot;still felt by readers encountering Meredith today&quot;. Roberts argues that Meredith&#x27;s use of dialogue and multiple voices make him &quot;a Bakhtinian novelist &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;.

His prose, aphoristic and allusive, has often been seen as a barrier to comprehension, with some critics arguing that the style, rather than being a means to an end, serves as an end in itself. Oscar Wilde&#x27;s description of &quot;chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning&quot; has been echoed by many others. A recurring objection is the mental effort required to decipher his meaning. &quot;Readers,&quot; writes Vanessa L. Ryan, &quot;complained that Meredith made too constant an appeal to thoughtfulness ... [and] charged his writing with too many ideas and mental abstractions.&quot;

However, admirers since George Eliot have applauded the poetic qualities of Meredith&#x27;s prose. For Max Beerbohm, he &quot;packs tight all his pages with wit, philosophy, poetry, and psychological analysis&quot;. Yet even an enthusiast as fervent as Beerbohm can concede that &quot;His obscurity, like that of Carlyle and Browning, is due less to extreme subtlety than to the plethoric abundance of his ideas&quot;.

In a thesis published in Meredith&#x27;s lifetime, Leah Durand Jones commented that his style is &quot;generally conceded to be more subtle and abstruse, more complex and intricate than that of any other modern writer&quot;: he &quot;usually avoids the conventional&quot;, achieves &quot;independence of thought and expression&quot; through the &quot;brilliancy of his epigrams&quot;, finds &quot;analogies in the most unexpected places&quot;, and possesses a &quot;power of compression&quot; which can disconcert readers, not least through a &quot;constant omission of pronouns, relatives, or even nouns and verbs&quot; that demands &quot;swiftness of comprehension&quot;. More recently, Matthew Sussman argues that Meredith&#x27;s style exemplifies the virtue of &quot;fervidness,&quot; which synthesizes two opposing impulses in the author&#x27;s mind: &quot;the first, identified with metaphor and epigram, gravitates toward the philosophical intensity of poetic condensation, while the second, identified with plotting and syntax, seeks the imaginative freedom of discursive prose.&quot;

As a poet, Meredith has drawn both praise and criticism for his innovation in metrical and stanzaic forms, along with his unorthodox syntax and metaphors. But his poetry is more varied than many assessments recognise; noting the tendency to overlook the pessimistic poetry Meredith produced after &quot;Modern Love&quot; and until the 1880s, Arthur L. Simpson explains that &quot;The contrast between the derivative Romanticism of the early poems and the evolutionary naturalism of those published after 1880 is striking&quot;, and notes, of Meredith&#x27;s work in the 1860s and 1870s, that &quot;The tensions and polarities of the poems of this period bear comparison to those in the poetry of the early Tennyson, of Arnold, and of the Hopkins of the terrible sonnets.&quot;

<text>Gaston Maurice Julia (3 February 1893 – 19 March 1978) was a French mathematician who devised the formula for the Julia set. His works were popularized by Benoit Mandelbrot; the Julia and Mandelbrot fractals are closely related. He founded, independently with Pierre Fatou, the modern theory of holomorphic dynamics.

==Military service==
Julia was born in the Algerian town of Sidi Bel Abbes, at the time governed by the French. During his youth, he had an interest in mathematics and music. His studies were interrupted at the age of 21, when France became involved in World War I and Julia was conscripted to serve with the army. During an attack he suffered a severe injury, losing his nose. His many operations to remedy the situation were all unsuccessful, and for the rest of his life he resigned himself to wearing a leather strap around the area where his nose had been.

==Career in mathematics==
Julia gained attention for his mathematical work at the age of 25, in 1918, when his 199-page &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;itération des fonctions rationnelles&quot; (&quot;Memoir on the Iteration of Rational Functions&quot;) was featured in the &quot;Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées&quot;. This article gained immense popularity among mathematicians and earned him the &quot;Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques&quot; of the French Academy of Sciences in 1918. But after this brief moment of fame, his works were mostly forgotten until Benoit Mandelbrot mentioned them in his works on fractals in the French book &quot;Les Objets Fractals: Forme, Hasard et Dimension&quot;, later translated in 1977 as &quot;Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension&quot;.

On 19 March 1978, Julia died in Paris at the age of 85.

Julia was also father to Marc Julia, the French organic chemist who invented the Julia olefination.

==World War Two and collaboration==

Julia collaborated with Nazi Germany during the occupation of France; recruiting French mathematicians to collaborate with the Zentralblatt für Mathematik. He was suspended for a few weeks after the liberation of France, but according to Michèle Audin:

<doc id="249108" wikidata="Q176537" url="?curid=249108" title="Andy Gibb">
<text>Andrew Roy Gibb (5 March 1958 – 10 March 1988) was an English singer and songwriter. He was the younger brother of Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, musicians who had formed the Bee Gees during the late-1950s. Gibb came to prominence in the late-1970s through the early-1980s with eight singles reaching the Top 20 of the US Hot 100, three of which went to No. 1: &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot; (1977), &quot;(Love Is) Thicker Than Water&quot; (1977), and &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot; (1978). In the early 1980s, he co-hosted the American music television series &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. He also performed in productions of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. Gibb would later have substance use problems and depression. He died on 10 March 1988 from complications due to drug abuse, aged 30.

==Life and career==
===1958–1975: Early life and first recordings===
Andy Gibb was born on 5 March 1958 at Stretford Memorial Hospital, Stretford, Lancashire. He was the youngest of the five children born to Barbara and Hugh Gibb. His mother was of Irish and English descent, and his father was of Scottish and English descent. He had four siblings: his sister, Lesley; and three brothers—Barry and fraternal twins Robin and Maurice.

At the age of six months, Gibb emigrated with his family to Queensland, Australia. The family shared three different homes at Redcliffe, Queensland, north of Brisbane, before settling on Cribb Island, a former suburb of Brisbane in January 1960. After moving several times between Brisbane and Sydney, Gibb returned to the United Kingdom in January 1967 as his three older brothers began to gain international fame as the Bee Gees.

In his childhood, his mother, Barbara, described Gibb as &quot;A little devil, a little monster. I&#x27;d send him off to school, but he&#x27;d sneak off to the stable and sleep with his two horses all day. He&#x27;d wander back home around lunchtime smelling of horse manure, yet he&#x27;d swear he had been at school. Oh, he was a little monkey!&quot; Producer and film director Tom Kennedy described Gibb&#x27;s personality in his childhood:
 Gibb dropped out of school at the age of 13, and with an acoustic guitar given to him by his older brother Barry, he began playing at tourist clubs around Ibiza, Spain (when his parents moved there), and later on the Isle of Man, his brothers&#x27; birthplace, where his parents were living at the time.

In June 1974, Gibb formed his first group, Melody Fayre (named after a Bee Gees song), which included Isle of Man musicians John Alderson on guitar, Stan Hughes on bass, and John Stringer on drums. The group was managed by Gibb&#x27;s mother, Barbara, and had regular bookings on the island&#x27;s hotel circuit. In August 1973, at the age of 15, Gibb made his first recordings at the Nova Sound Studios in London. The songs were &quot;Windows of My World&quot; and the country music number &quot;My Father&#x27;s a Rebel&quot;. The second song was written by Maurice Gibb (according to a November 1973 fan club newsletter) who also produced the session.

At the urging of his brother, Barry, Gibb returned to Australia in 1974. Barry believed that since Australia had been a good training ground for the Bee Gees, it would also help Gibb&#x27;s career. Lesley Gibb had remained in Australia, where she raised a family with her husband. Alderson and Stringer followed Gibb to Australia with the hope of forming a band there. With Col Joye producing, Gibb, Alderson, and Stringer recorded a number of Gibb&#x27;s songs. The first was a demo called &quot;To a Girl&quot;, with his brother Maurice playing organ, which he later performed on his television debut in Australia on &quot;The Ernie Sigley Show&quot;. Sigley later informed the audience that it was from Gibb&#x27;s forthcoming album, however it was never released.

In November of the same year, he recorded six demos—again produced by Joye—including &quot;Words and Music&quot;, &quot;Westfield Mansions&quot;, and &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot; (which was later released). What may have detracted from the &quot;training ground&quot; aspect of Australia for Gibb compared with his brothers was that he was relatively comfortable financially, mainly due to his brothers&#x27; support and largesse; hence, the group&#x27;s sporadic work rate. Gibb would disappear for periods of time, leaving Alderson and Stringer out of work with no income. Despondent, Alderson and Stringer returned to England.

Gibb later joined the band Zenta, consisting of Gibb on vocals, Rick Alford on guitar, Paddy Lelliot on bass, Glen Greenhalgh on vocals, and Trevor Norton on drums. Zenta supported international artists Sweet and the Bay City Rollers on the Sydney leg of their Australian tours. &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Dancing&quot; (a Ray Stevens song which was later a US hit for duo Captain and Tennille in May 1977) was pushed for release, but ultimately did not, although Gibb did perform it on television at least once on the revitalised &quot;Bandstand&quot; show hosted by Daryl Somers. Zenta would appear later as a backing band for Gibb, but did not participate on Gibb&#x27;s recording sessions around 1975, which featured Australian jazz fusion group Crossfire.

&quot;Words and Music&quot; was released on the ATA label, only in Australia and New Zealand, owned by Col Joye, who also produced the Bee Gees&#x27; first singles in Australia. It was Gibb&#x27;s first single and was backed by another composition &quot;Westfield Mansions&quot;. The single would eventually reach No. 78 in Australia and No. 29 in New Zealand. Gibb performed this song on &quot;Countdown&quot; on 7 September 1975. While in Australia, Gibb recorded demos of his compositions as well as his own renditions of old numbers. When Gibb had got the call from his brother Barry in June 1976 that he and Col Joye&#x27;s company ATA had proceeded with the new single (&quot;Words and Music&quot;), Gibb prepared to go to Florida later that year and had his last recording session before moving to the US, including &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot;, &quot;Come Home for the Winter&quot; and &quot;Let It Be Me&quot; which were later re-recorded in Criteria Studios.

===1976–1980: International success===
Gibb at that time lived in Seven Hills, an outer Sydney suburb where he married his girlfriend Kim Reeder at the Wayside Chapel on 11 July 1976. &quot;Kim breeds Staffordshire bull terriers and my sister does too&quot;, he once said. &quot;We met at a dog show when my sister Lesley introduced us&quot;. In 1977, they moved to West Hollywood. Reeder recalled, &quot;He became ensconced in the drug scene. Cocaine became his first love. He became depressed and paranoid.&quot; After they split up, Reeder moved back to Australia, where she gave birth to their daughter, Peta, on 25 January 1978. Gibb and Reeder divorced later that year.

Robert Stigwood, who at the time was the Bee Gees&#x27; manager, signed Gibb to his label, RSO Records in early 1976, after he heard some of his demo tapes. Gibb soon moved to Miami Beach, to begin working on songs with his brother Barry and co-producers Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. In late 1976 in Miami, Gibb, with his brother Barry producing and recording in Criteria Studios, set about making his first album &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot;. Eagles guitarist Joe Walsh played on two songs on the album while recording &quot;Hotel California&quot;. On Gibb&#x27;s compositions, the tracks were a mix of country music and ballads. After the release of &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot;, Gibb revealed:

The first release from the album, and Gibb&#x27;s first single released outside Australia, was &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot; which was written by Barry, who also provided backup vocals. It reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three weeks, starting on the week ending 30 July 1977, and again for the week ending 17 September 1977. &quot;I Just Want to be Your Everything&quot; was Gibb&#x27;s longest-running chart single on &quot;Billboard, Record World,&quot; and &quot;Cashbox&quot; and earned him a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male at the 20th Grammy Awards. The song was later ranked No. 26 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 55th anniversary &quot;All Time Top 100&quot;. Gibb later recalled Barry&#x27;s writing style:

So, once we discussed it all and got the deal together, me and Barry locked ourselves in a bedroom and Barry just started writing. When Barry writes, it is very hard to collaborate with him, because he is so quick. And before I knew it he was starting to do the chorus of &#x27;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&#x27;, and I thought, &#x27;Wow what a hook!&#x27;. He&#x27;s an expert at his craft. Within about 20 minutes, he&#x27;d written a number one record; and then we went right into another one, &#x27;(Love Is) Thicker than Water&#x27;.

Eight of the ten tracks on the album were Gibb compositions, mostly written during his time in Australia. These included a re-recording of his previous single, &quot;Words and Music&quot;. In September 1977 &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot;, with another No. 1 single &quot;(Love Is) Thicker Than Water&quot; (also co-written by Gibb and his brother Barry) to support it, quickly became a multi-million selling album. That single broke in early 1978 during the time that the Bee Gees&#x27; contributions to the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack were dominating the world charts. In the United States it replaced &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; at the top of the Hot 100 on the day before Gibb&#x27;s 20th birthday, only to be surpassed by &quot;Night Fever&quot; at No. 1 two weeks later. Both of the singles from &quot;Flowing Rivers&quot; were certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding 500,000 units.

Gibb then began work with the Gibb-Galuten-Richardson production team on his second album, &quot;Shadow Dancing&quot;, which was released in April 1978 and was his highest-charting album in America (No. 7) and Canada (No. 1). The title track, written by all four Gibb brothers, was released as a single in the United States in April 1978. In mid-June it began a seven-week run at No. 1, achieving platinum status and the honour of being &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s No. 1 song of 1978. In the United States, Gibb became the first male solo artist to have three consecutive No. 1 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with all of the weeks at the top of the chart happening in less than year, from 30 July 1977 through 29 July 1978. Two further Top 10 singles, &quot;An Everlasting Love&quot; (No. 5) and &quot;(Our Love) Don&#x27;t Throw It All Away&quot; (No. 9), were released from the album, which became another multi-million seller.

In 1979, Gibb performed along with the Bee Gees, ABBA and Olivia Newton-John (duet with &quot;Rest Your Love on Me&quot;) at the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly, which was broadcast worldwide. He returned to the studio to begin recording sessions for his final full studio album &quot;After Dark&quot;. In March 1980, the last of Gibb&#x27;s Top 10 singles charted just ahead of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Desire&quot; (No. 4) was recorded for the Bee Gees&#x27; 1979 album &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; and featured their original track, complete with Gibb&#x27;s original &quot;guest vocal&quot; track. A second single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, a duet with family friend and fellow British and Australian expat Olivia Newton-John, reached the Top 20 (No. 12). In 1984, Gibb performed this song on the sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; in the episode &quot;Play It Again, Punky&quot; where Gibb guest starred as Punky&#x27;s piano teacher.

Despite being certified Gold, the album&#x27;s disappointing performance, coupled with Gibb&#x27;s mounting drug problems, would lead to RSO Records dropping Gibb from its roster. Later in the year, &quot;Andy Gibb&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; was released as a finale to his contract with RSO Records, with two new songs: &quot;Time Is Time&quot; (No. 15 in January 1981) and &quot;Me (Without You)&quot; (Gibb&#x27;s last Top 40 chart entry) shipped as singles, before RSO founder Robert Stigwood let him go due to his cocaine addiction and behavioural problems. &quot;After Dark&quot; and &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot; were non-single songs added to the album, the latter of which was a duet with P. P. Arnold, who had previously worked with Barry Gibb, including singing uncredited backups on &quot;Bury Me Down by the River&quot; from &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot;. Around the same time, Gibb was invited to sing the first verse on Queen&#x27;s &quot;Play the Game&quot;, and lead singer Freddie Mercury apparently was amazed with Gibb&#x27;s abilities. According to some sources, the tape was found in 1990 in a search of Queen archives for bonus tracks for a CD but was not used. Since it has not been heard by any Queen collectors, its existence is somewhat doubtful, although record producer Mack has also confirmed that the version does exist.

===1981–1986: Decline and live performances===

While taping &quot;The John Davidson Show&quot; in January 1981, Gibb met actress Victoria Principal. During their high-profile relationship, Gibb began working on several projects outside the recording studio. He co-hosted the television music show &quot;Solid Gold&quot; from 1981 to 1982 with Marilyn McCoo. He also performed in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; in Los Angeles and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; on Broadway. Gibb was ultimately fired from both &quot;Joseph&quot; and &quot;Solid Gold&quot; because of absenteeism caused by cocaine binges. Said Zev Buffman, a Broadway producer and financier for &quot;Joseph&quot;, &quot;When Andy was at the theater, he was a joy. But he wasn&#x27;t there enough&quot;, adding that of the five people to play Joseph up to that point, Gibb was the best actor.

He also said after Gibb&#x27;s death, &quot;We&#x27;d lose him over long weekends. He&#x27;d come back on Tuesday, and he&#x27;d look beat. He was like a little puppy—so ashamed when he did something wrong. He was all heart, but he didn&#x27;t have enough muscle to carry through.&quot; An unnamed co-star in &quot;Joseph&quot; was quoted as saying, &quot;I hear he spent most of his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. I guess he was frightened and insecure. That&#x27;s what happens when you&#x27;re the baby brother of the Bee Gees.&quot; Commenting after Gibb&#x27;s death, &quot;Solid Gold&quot; producer Brad Lachman stated, &quot;...[Andy] was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn&#x27;t being difficult. He was going through problems he couldn&#x27;t deal with. He wanted everyone to love him. He had so much going for him, and he just couldn&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

In August 1981, Gibb and Principal released a duet of The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;. This would be Gibb&#x27;s last official single, and his last US chart entry, peaking at No. 51. Principal recalled after that, &quot;Well, it became very apparent to me that his behavior was becoming erratic and that he was very, very thin. And Andy was a very kind person and a very gentle person, and some of his behavior seemed the antithesis of who I knew him to be. And over a period of ... deduction, I finally realized that it had to be drugs&quot;. Their romance ended shortly thereafter when she gave him an ultimatum to choose between her or drugs. After this, Gibb began dating actress Kari Michaelsen of the NBC television sitcom &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;; Gibb met Michaelsen when he had guest starred on the series for one episode.

In 1984 and 1985, Gibb finished two successful contracts at the Riviera hotel in Las Vegas. His family convinced him to seek treatment for his drug addiction, which included a stay at the Betty Ford Center in 1985. It was during this time that Gibb began touring small venues with a stage show featuring his hits as well as covers. He also appeared in guest-starring roles on television sitcom &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; and &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot; Following an extensive tour of East Asia, he regularly performed shows in Las Vegas and Lake Tahoe. In 1984, he was the headline performer at the Viña del Mar Festival in Chile, performing two nights in a row. He also held a two-week engagement at San Francisco&#x27;s historic Fairmont Hotel in March 1986.

===1987–1988: Attempted comeback and final days===
In early-1987, Gibb went through another drug rehabilitation program and thought he had finally beaten his habits. Gibb now aimed to get a recording contract for release of a new album in 1988. He returned to the studio in June 1987 recording four songs; one of them, &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, was released posthumously in 1991 on a Polydor Records anthology. Another track, &quot;Arrow Through the Heart&quot;, was the final song Gibb would record and was featured on an episode of VH1&#x27;s series, &quot;Behind the Music&quot; and released on the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Mythology&quot; 4-disc box set in November 2010. The songs were co-written by Gibb with Barry and Maurice. Their demo recordings with engineer Scott Glasel were heard by Clive Banks from the English branch of Island Records. Gibb never formally signed a contract, but the record label planned to release a single in Europe that spring, followed by another single that summer with the album to follow. In March 1988, Barry arranged for Island Records to sign Gibb, but when he arrived in England in January 1988, he panicked. Gibb missed meetings with the record company and blamed himself for his trouble writing songs; the deal was never signed.

==Death==
By late January to early February in 1988, Gibb had seemingly beaten his drug addiction, regained his health, and was ready to begin recording a new album; however, he still suffered depression over his break-up with Victoria Principal.&lt;ref name=&quot;idea/ref&quot;&gt;New Idea, 25 November 1989. Robin Gibb: &quot;Andy was scared of us&quot;, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robin Gibb, his brother &quot;just went downhill so fast... he was in a terrible state of depression&quot;. During this period, Gibb slipped back into alcoholic habits, and was receiving phone calls from brothers Maurice and Barry (one call Barry would regret making), with last-ditch efforts to get Gibb to stop. On 5 March 1988, Gibb celebrated his 30th birthday in London while working on the new album. Two days later, he entered John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford complaining of chest pains.
At around 8:30 am on 10 March 1988, Gibb&#x27;s doctor informed him more tests were needed to determine the cause of his chest pains. Shortly afterward, Gibb slumped into unconsciousness and died as a result of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle most likely caused by a virus. Years of cocaine use also weakened his heart. This diagnosis was supported by William Shell, a cardiologist who previously treated Gibb.

Upon the announcement of Gibb&#x27;s death, his ex-wife, Kim Reeder, was not surprised. &quot;I always knew that one day I&#x27;d get a call with news like this. It was only a matter of time.&quot; Gibb&#x27;s family said the cause of death was not an overdose, as some media reports suggested, but natural causes after years of substance abuse.

Gibb&#x27;s body was flown to the United States, where he was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. The headstone reads &quot;Andy Gibb / March 5, 1958 – March 10, 1988 / An Everlasting Love&quot;, after one of his hit singles.

==Legacy==
The Andy Gibb Memorial Foundation contributes to charities that Gibb supported, such as the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, and the Diabetes Research Institute. The song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, which was a track on the Bee Gees 1989 album &quot;One&quot;, was dedicated by his brothers to Gibb.

== Awards and nominations ==
Gibb was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 20th Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for two American Music Awards.

<doc id="249109" wikidata="Q12061332" url="?curid=249109" title="Little Wonder Records">
<text>Little Wonder Records was a United States budget record label from 1914 through 1923. The label was known for producing one-sided records with abbreviated versions of songs at a very low price.

==History==
Little Wonders were manufactured by the Columbia Phonograph Company, and were distributed exclusively by music publisher Henry Waterson (the business partner of Irving Berlin) in their early years (1914–1916) – an arrangement that has only recently been discovered as the original contract stipulated that both parties were to keep this relationship a secret. Artists are generally uncredited on Little Wonder labels, which simply give recordings general attributions such as &quot;band&quot;, &quot;tenor&quot;, &quot;quartette&quot;, or &quot;accordion solo&quot;.

Little Wonders were lateral-cut single sided inch gramophone records. The records contained only about to 2 minutes of music. The small size of the discs (together with the cherubic face on later versions of the label) has led some record collectors to incorrectly assume that Little Wonders were made as children&#x27;s records; they were actually made for the general audience looking for low-priced recordings.

The records retailed for ten cents each, some of the lowest priced recordings available at the time. This price point revolutionized popular recorded music, significantly expanding the market. The audio fidelity is average to slightly above average for the time, with rather narrow grooves (best played with a smaller stylus than contemporary discs). An estimated forty million of these records were sold, principally through the sheet music counters of many five and ten cent store chains of the time and through Sears Roebuck catalogs, rather than in record stores.
All known Little Wonders were made by artists who also recorded for Columbia. One account says that recording artists would visit the Little Wonder recording studio on one floor of the Woolworth Building before or after making records at the Columbia studio on a higher floor of the same building. There has been some speculation that the masters for Little Wonders were actually warm-up balance checks recorded as tests at the beginning of Columbia recording sessions; if such tests happened to record a usable performance, they would be leased to Little Wonder. However, court papers from an early lawsuit between Waterson and Victor Emerson indicate that performers were paid separately and specifically to record for Little Wonder records.

Little Wonder #1 was &quot;Ben Bolt&quot;, sung by Henry Burr, who would make more recordings for the label than any other artist. The vaudevillian Sam Ash made the most recordings as a solo artist, beginning with Little Wonder #98, a version of &quot;Chinatown, My Chinatown&quot;. Al Jolson recorded a version of &quot;Back to the Carolina You Love&quot; (1914) on the label; Jolson was a Columbia artist, but this was his only Little Wonder recording. Other noted artists of the day whose performances were released (uncredited) on Little Wonder include Gene Greene, Wilbur Sweatman, Billy Murray, Vernon Dalhart, Frank Crumit, the Louisiana Five and the California Ramblers.

Beginning in 1916 Columbia took full control of Little Wonder, and in 1917 it began issuing small illustrated children&#x27;s books called &quot;Bubble Books&quot;, and were also best sellers. Much later Columbia also issued various promotional discs in the same &quot;small disc&quot; numerical series, but these should not be confused with the Little Wonder label.

Little Wonder #339, &quot;The Camp Meeting Jubilee&quot; by a male vocal &quot;quartette&quot;, issued in 1916, contains the lyrics &quot;We&#x27;ve been rockin&#x27; an&#x27; rolling in your arms / Rockin&#x27; and rolling in your arms / In the arms of Moses.&quot; This is believed to be one of the earliest uses in an audio recording of the phrase &quot;rock ... and roll&quot;, albeit in the context of a religious spiritual.

<doc id="249110" wikidata="Q1270673" url="?curid=249110" title="Tom Hood">
<text>Thomas Hood (19 January 183520 November 1874) was an English humorist, playwright and author. He was the son of the poet and author Thomas Hood. &quot;Pen and Pencil Pictures&quot; (1857) was the first of his illustrated books. His most successful novel was &quot;Captain Master&#x27;s Children&quot; (1865).

==Biography==

Hood was born at Lake House, Leytonstone, England, the son of the poet Thomas Hood and his wife Jane (née Reynolds) (1791–1846). His elder sister was the children&#x27;s writer Frances Freeling Broderip. After attending University College School and Louth Grammar School, he entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1853. There he studied for the Church and passed all the examinations for the degree of BA, but did not graduate.

At Oxford, he wrote his &quot;Farewell to the Swallows&quot; (1853) and &quot;Pen and Pencil Pictures&quot; (1854). He began to write for the &quot;Liskeard Gazette&quot; in 1856, and edited that paper in 1858 and 1859. In 1861 he wrote &quot;Quips and Cranks&quot;, and &quot;Daughters of King Daher, and other Poems&quot;. The next year, he published &quot;Loves of Tom Tucker and Little Bo-Peep, a Rhyming Rigmarole&quot;, followed in 1864 by &quot;Vere Vereker&#x27;s Vengeance, a Sensation&quot;, and in 1865 by &quot;Jingles and Jokes for the Little Folks&quot;. His novels included &quot;A Disputed Inheritance&quot; (1863), &quot;A Golden Heart&quot; (1867), &quot;The Lost Link&quot; (1868), &quot;Captain Masters&#x27;s Children&quot; (1865), and &quot;Love and Valour&quot; (1872). In 1866 he translated Ernest L&#x27;Épine&#x27;s &quot;La Légende de Croquemitaine&quot;.

He also wrote two books on English verse composition, several children&#x27;s books (in conjunction with his sister, Frances Freeling Broderip), and a body of magazine and journal articles. Hood drew with considerable facility, and illustrated several of his father&#x27;s comic verses, some of which were collected in his father&#x27;s book &quot;Precocious Piggy&quot;.

Meanwhile, in 1860, the younger Hood obtained a position in the War Office, which he served for five years. In 1865 he left the War Office when selected as editor of &quot;Fun&quot;, a Victorian weekly magazine which became very popular under his direction. In 1867, he first issued &quot;Tom Hood&#x27;s Comic Annual&quot;, not to be confused with the similarly-named &quot;Comic Annual&quot; that had been published in 1830 through 1842 by his father, the senior Thomas Hood (who, by then, had already died).

In private life, Hood&#x27;s geniality and sincere friendliness secured him the affection and esteem of a wide circle of acquaintance. Some of these friends became contributors to his publications. For example, he befriended the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the American journalist Ambrose Bierce, both frequent contributors to &quot;Fun&quot;. Hood wrote the burlesque, &quot;Robinson Crusoe; or, The Injun Bride and the Injured Wife&quot; (1867), together with Gilbert, H. J. Byron, H. S. Leigh and Arthur Sketchley. Hood&#x27;s &quot;Fun&quot; gang also included playwright Thomas W. Robertson, among others.

Hood&#x27;s first wife, Susan (on occasion called &quot;Mrs Tom&quot;), died in 1873, at the age of only thirty-seven. He married Justine Rudolphine Charotton (born 1844/5) on 15 August 1874, only a few months before his own death.

Hood died suddenly in his cottage at Peckham Rye, Surrey, on 20 November 1874 and was buried in Nunhead cemetery.

==Controversy over &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;==
In 1887 the literary critic Edward Salmon suggested that Lewis Carroll had plagiarised Hood&#x27;s &quot;From Nowhere to the North Pole&quot; (1875) when writing &quot;Alice&quot;:

Carroll replied a month later, in a terse letter to editor of &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot;:

In 1889 Carroll even inserted an announcement in the back of &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot;, correcting his previous explanation and further denying Tom Hood&#x27;s influence:

==Legacy and honours==
* British dramatist Thomas W. Robertson dedicated his play &quot;Society&quot; (1864) to Hood — &quot;To my dear friend Tom Hood this play is dedicated.&quot;
* His sister, Frances Freeling Broderip, wrote a memoir of him that was published with an 1877 edition of his poems.
* Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s short story &quot;The Damned Thing&quot; was inspired by an alleged encounter with Tom Hood&#x27;s spirit.
* In 1925, Tom Hood School in Leytonstone was renamed after Hood.

<text>The Inns of Court in London are the professional associations for barristers in England and Wales. There are four Inns of Court: Gray&#x27;s Inn, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, Inner Temple and Middle Temple.

All barristers must belong to one of them. They have supervisory and disciplinary functions over their members. The Inns also provide libraries, dining facilities and professional accommodation. Each also has a church or chapel attached to it and is a self-contained precinct where barristers traditionally train and practise. However, growth in the legal profession, together with a desire to practise from more modern accommodations and buildings with lower rents, caused many barristers&#x27; chambers to move outside the precincts of the Inns of Court in the late 20th century.

==History==
During the 12th and early 13th centuries, law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. In 1219 Pope Honorius III promulgated &quot;Super Specula&quot;, prohibiting the clergy from studying secular law as opposed to canon law. As a result, English common law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of clerics. To protect their schools from competition, first Henry II () and later Henry III () issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the civil law within the City of London. The common-law lawyers worked in guilds of law, modelled on trade guilds, which in time became the Inns of Court.

In the earliest centuries of their existence, beginning with the 14th century, the Inns were any of a sizeable number of buildings or precincts where lawyers traditionally lodged, trained and carried on their profession. Over the centuries, the four Inns of Court became where barristers were trained, while the more numerous Inns of Chancery – which were initially affiliated to the Inns of Court – became associated with the training of solicitors in the Elizabethan era.

The four Inns of Court are:
* The Honourable Society of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn
* The Honourable Society of the Inner Temple
* The Honourable Society of the Middle Temple
* The Honourable Society of Gray&#x27;s Inn

Lawyers have lived and worked in the Temple since 1320. In 1337 the premises were divided into the Inner Temple, where the lawyers resided, and Middle Temple, which was also occupied by lawyers by 1346. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, the largest, is able to trace its official records to 1422. The records of Gray&#x27;s Inn begin in 1569, but teaching is thought to have begun there in the late-fourteenth century. In 1620 a meeting of senior judges decided that all four Inns would be equal in order of precedence.

In the 16th century and earlier, students or apprentices learned their craft primarily by attending court sessions and by sharing both accommodation and education during the legal terms. Prior to the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, this training lasted at least seven years; subsequently, the Inns focused their residency requirements on dining together in the company of experienced barristers, to enable learning through contact and networking with experts. In the mid-18th century the common law was first recognised as a subject for study in the universities, and by 1872 bar examinations became compulsory for entry into the profession of law.

===Importance in English Renaissance theatre===

The Inns played an important role in the history of the English Renaissance theatre. Notable literary figures and playwrights who resided in the Inns of Court included John Donne (1572-1631), Francis Beaumont (1584-1616), John Marston (1576-1634), Thomas Lodge (-1625), Thomas Campion (1567-1620), Abraham Fraunce ( 1559- 1593), Sir Philip Sidney (1554-1586), Sir Thomas More (1478-1535), Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626), and George Gascoigne (-1577). Plays written and performed in the Inns of Court include &quot;Gorboduc, Gismund of Salerne&quot; (1561), and &quot;The Misfortunes of Arthur&quot; (1588). An example of a famous masque put on by the Inns was James Shirley&#x27;s &quot;The Triumph of Peace&quot; (1634). Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; () and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; () were also performed at the Inns, although written for commercial theatre.

===Military tradition===

Since at least 1584, members of the Inns of Court have rallied to the defence of the realm during times of crisis. That tradition continues to the present, in that 10 Stone Buildings in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn has been the permanent home of the Inns of Court &amp; City Yeomanry since the building was freed up by the abolition of the Clerks of Chancery in 1842.

==Membership and governance==
Each of the four Inns of Court has three ordinary grades of membership: students, barristers, and masters of the bench or &quot;benchers&quot;. The benchers constitute the governing body for each Inn and appoint new members from among existing barrister members. As a rule, any barrister member of the inn is eligible for appointment. In practice, appointments are made of senior members of the Bar, usually KCs, or High Court judges or those who carry out work on behalf of the Inn, be it on committees or through the training of students and other junior members.

The senior bencher of each Inn is the Treasurer, a position which is held for one year only. Each Inn usually also has at least one royal bencher. They may also appoint honorary benchers, from academics, the world of politics and overseas judiciary.

The Inns of Court no longer provide all the education and training needed by prospective barristers, who must pass the Bar Professional Training Course, but do provide supplementary education during the &#x27;Bar School&#x27; year, pupillage and the early years of practice. All prospective Bar School students must be a member of one of the four Inns, and must attend ten (formerly twelve) &#x27;qualifying sessions&#x27; before being eligible to qualify as a barrister. Qualifying sessions traditionally comprise formal dinners followed by law-related talks, but increasingly the inns offer training weekends that may count for several sessions&#x27; worth of attendance. The Inns still retain the sole right to call qualified students to the bar, which is associated with a graduation ceremony (&#x27;Call Day&#x27;).

Prospective students may choose which Inn to apply to for membership, but can only apply to one Inn for scholarships. It makes no long-term difference which Inn a barrister joins; an applicant might, for example, choose a particular inn because he or she knows someone already a member, or it has a student association at their university.

The inns&#x27; disciplinary functions are carried out by a joint Council of the Inns of Court, which administers the disciplinary tribunals. Barristers are prosecuted by the Bar Standards Board.

==Location and layout==

The four inns are located near one another in central London, near the western boundary of the City of London. Nearby are the Royal Courts of Justice, which were moved for convenience from Westminster Hall to the legal quarter of London in 1882.

Middle Temple and Inner Temple are liberties of the City of London, which means they are within the historic boundaries of the City but are not subject to its jurisdiction. They operate as their own local authorities. These two Inns neighbour each other and occupy the core of the Temple area. The closest Tube station is Temple.

Gray&#x27;s Inn and Lincoln&#x27;s Inn are in the London Borough of Camden (formerly in the Borough of Holborn) near the boundary with the City of London. They do not have the status of a local authority. The nearest Tube station is Chancery Lane.

Each Inn is a substantial complex with a great hall, chapel, libraries, sets of chambers for many hundreds of barristers, and gardens, and covers several acres. The layout is similar to that of an Oxbridge college. The chambers were originally used as residences as well as business premises by many of the barristers, but today they serve as offices with only a small number of apartments.

==Historically related Inns==
===Serjeants&#x27; Inn===
Another important inn, Serjeants&#x27; Inn, was dissolved in 1877 and its assets were, controversially, distributed amongst the existing members. The membership of the Inn had consisted of a small class of senior barristers called serjeants-at-law, who were selected from the members of the other four inns and had exclusive rights of audience in certain Courts. Their pre-eminence was affected by the new rank of King&#x27;s Counsel, which was granted to barristers who were not serjeants. The serjeant&#x27;s privileges were withdrawn by the government in the 19th century, no more serjeants were appointed, and they eventually died out. The area now known as Serjeants&#x27; Inn, one of two sites formerly occupied by the Serjeants (the other being in Chancery Lane), was purchased by the Inner Temple in 2002.

It was formerly the custom for senior judges to join Serjeants&#x27; Inn, thereby leaving the Inn in which they had practised as barristers. This meant that the Masters of the Bench of the four barristers&#x27; Inns of Court were mostly themselves barristers. Since there is now no Serjeants&#x27; Inn, judges remain in the Inns which they joined as students and belonged to as barristers. This has had the effect of making the majority of the Masters of the Bench senior judges, either because they become benchers when appointed as judges, or because they become judges after being appointed as benchers.

===Inns of Chancery===

There were also several Inns of Chancery. These are not Inns of Court but are associated to them: Clement&#x27;s Inn, Clifford&#x27;s Inn and Lyon&#x27;s Inn (attached to the Inner Temple); Strand Inn and New Inn (attached to the Middle Temple); Furnival&#x27;s Inn and Thavie&#x27;s Inn (attached to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn); and Staple Inn and Barnard&#x27;s Inn (attached to Gray&#x27;s Inn).

===Irish Inns of Court===
In the Republic of Ireland, there is only one Inn of Court, the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns, founded in Dublin in 1541. After the partition of Ireland, a separate Northern Ireland Inn of Court was founded in Belfast in 1926.

==American Inns of Court==

From the late 1970s, U.S. Chief Justice Warren Burger led a movement to create Inns of Court in the United States, loosely modelled after the traditional English Inns. In 1985, he and others established the American Inns of Court Foundation to promote and formally charter local Inns of Court across the United States. Each local Inn is devoted to promoting professionalism, civility, ethics, and legal skills amongst the American bench and bar, in a collegial setting, through continuing education and mentoring. At present, each major American city has more than one Inn of Court; for example, one Inn may be affiliated with a local law school, and another may be associated with a specific field of legal practice. American Inns of Court do not possess any real property. They are groups of judges, practising attorneys, law professors and students who meet regularly (usually monthly) to discuss and debate issues relating to legal ethics and professionalism. American Inn of Court meetings typically consist of a shared meal and a programme presented by one of the Inn&#x27;s pupillage teams.

The U.S. does not require attorneys to be members of an Inn of Court, and many of the equivalent functions are performed by state bar associations. Some states require attorneys to belong to the official bar association, e.g., the State Bar of Michigan, while other states, such as Illinois, do not make membership of an official bar association a compulsory condition of licensure. Neither voluntary professional associations (including the American Inns of Court) nor mandatory bar associations typically have any role in training or licensing of law students that would be comparable to that function of the four English Inns of Court in selection and training of new barristers.

While the American Inns of Court share a collegial relationship with the English Inns, there is no formal or legal relationship. A Declaration of Friendship was signed by the English and American Inns of Court, establishing visitation procedures under which American Inn members can acquire a letter of introduction that will officially introduce them to the Inns in England and Ireland, with reciprocal procedures available for English and Irish barristers. An annual six-week exchange program, known as the Pegasus Scholarships, was created to provide for young English barristers to travel to the United States, and young American Inn of Court members to travel to London, to learn about the legal system of the other jurisdiction.

<doc id="249114" wikidata="Q722533" url="?curid=249114" title="Thomas Hood">
<text>Thomas Hood (23 May 1799 – 3 May 1845) was an English poet, author and humorist, best known for poems such as &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Shirt&quot;. Hood wrote regularly for &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, and &quot;Punch&quot;. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, had lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. William Michael Rossetti in 1903 called him &quot;the finest English poet&quot; between the generations of Shelley and Tennyson. Hood was the father of the playwright and humorist Tom Hood (1835–1874) and the children&#x27;s writer Frances Freeling Broderip (1830–1878).

==Early life==

Thomas Hood was born to Thomas Hood and Elizabeth Sands in Poultry (Cheapside), London, above his father&#x27;s bookshop. His father&#x27;s family had been Scottish farmers from the village of Errol near Dundee. The elder Hood was a partner in the business of Vernor, Hood and Sharp, a member of the Associated Booksellers. Hood&#x27;s son, Tom Hood, claimed that his grandfather had been the first to open up the book trade with America and had had great success with new editions of old books.

&quot;Next to being a citizen of the world,&quot; writes Thomas Hood in his &quot;Literary Reminiscences&quot;, &quot;it must be the best thing to be born a citizen of the world&#x27;s greatest city.&quot; On the death of her husband in 1811, Hood&#x27;s mother moved to Islington, where he had a schoolmaster who in appreciating his talents, &quot;made him feel it impossible not to take an interest in learning while he seemed so interested in teaching.&quot; Under the care of this &quot;decayed dominie&quot;, he earned a few guineas – his first literary fee – by revising for the press a new edition of the 1788 novel &quot;Paul and Virginia&quot;.

Hood left his private schoolmaster at 14 years of age and was admitted soon after into the counting house of a friend of his family, where he &quot;turned his stool into a Pegasus on three legs, every foot, of course, being a dactyl or a spondee.&quot; However, the uncongenial profession affected his health, which was never strong, and he began to study engraving. The exact nature and course of his study is unclear: various sources tell different stories. Reid emphasizes his work under his maternal uncle Robert Sands, but no deeds of apprenticeship exist and his letters show he studied with a Mr Harris. Hood&#x27;s daughter in her &quot;Memorials&quot; mentions her father&#x27;s association with the Le Keux brothers, who were successful engravers in the City.

The labour of engraving was no better for his health than the counting house had been, and Hood was sent to his father&#x27;s relations at Dundee, Scotland. There he stayed in the house of his maternal aunt, Jean Keay, for some months. Then on falling out with her, he moved on to the boarding house of one of her friends, Mrs Butterworth, where he lived for the rest of his time in Scotland. In Dundee, Hood made a number of close friends with whom he continued to correspond for many years. He led a healthy outdoor life, but also became a wide and indiscriminate reader. At the same time he began seriously to write poetry and he appeared in print for the first time, with a letter to the editor of the &quot;Dundee Advertiser&quot;.

==Literary society==
Before long Hood was contributing humorous and poetical pieces to provincial newspapers and magazines. As a proof of his literary vocation, he would write out his poems in printed characters, believing that this process best enabled him to understand his own peculiarities and faults, and probably unaware that Samuel Taylor Coleridge had recommended some such method of criticism when he said he thought, &quot;Print settles it.&quot; On his return to London in 1818 he applied himself to engraving, which enabled him later to illustrate his various humours and fancies.

In 1821, John Scott, editor of &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, was killed in a duel, and the periodical passed into the hands of some friends of Hood, who proposed to make him sub-editor. This post at once introduced him to the literary society of the time. He gradually developed his powers by becoming an associate of John Hamilton Reynolds, Charles Lamb, Henry Cary, Thomas de Quincey, Allan Cunningham, Bryan Procter, Serjeant Talfourd, Hartley Coleridge, the peasant-poet John Clare, and other contributors.

==Family life==

Hood married Jane Reynolds (1791–1846). on 5 May 1824. They settled at 2 Robert Street, Adelphi, Westminster. Their first child died at birth, but a daughter, Frances Freeling Broderip (1830–1878), was born soon after they moved to Winchmore Hill, and after they had then moved in 1832 to Lake House, Wanstead, a son, Tom Hood (1835–1874), was also born. Both children took up in Hood&#x27;s profession: Frances became a children&#x27;s writer and Tom a humorist and playwright, and they later collaborated in collecting and publishing their father&#x27;s work. Although constantly worried about money and health, the Hoods were a devoted, affectionate family, as &quot;Memorials of Thomas Hood&quot; (1860), based on his letters and compiled by his children, testifies.

&quot;Odes and Addresses&quot; – Hood&#x27;s first volume – was written in conjunction with his brother-in-law John Hamilton Reynolds, a friend of John Keats. Coleridge wrote to Lamb averring that the book must be the latter&#x27;s work. Keats wrote two poems for Jane Reynolds: &quot;O Sorrow!&quot; (October 1817) and &quot;On a Leander Gem which Miss Reynolds, my Kind Friend, Gave Me&quot; (c. March 1817). Also from this period are &quot;The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies&quot; (1827) and a dramatic romance, &quot;Lamia&quot;, published later. &quot;The Plea&quot; was a book of serious verse, but Hood was known as a humorist and the book was ignored almost entirely.

Hood was fond of practical jokes, which he was said to have enjoyed inflicting on members of his family. In the &quot;Memorials&quot; there is a story of Hood instructing his wife Jane to purchase some fish for the evening meal from a woman who regularly came to the door selling her husband&#x27;s catch. But he warns her to watch for plaice that &quot;has any appearance of red or orange spots, as they are a sure sign of an advanced stage of decomposition.&quot; Mrs Hood refused to purchase the fish-seller&#x27;s plaice, exclaiming, &quot;My good woman... I could not think of buying any plaice with those very unpleasant red spots!&quot; The fish-seller was amazed at such ignorance of what plaice look like.

The series of the &quot;Comic Annual&quot;, dating from 1830, was a type of publication popular at the time, which Hood undertook and continued almost unassisted for several years. He would cover all the leading events of the day in caricature, without personal malice, and with an undercurrent of sympathy. Readers were also treated to an incessant use of puns, of which Hood had written in his own vindication, &quot;However critics may take offence,/A double meaning has double sense&quot;, but as he gained experience as a writer, his diction became simpler.

==Later writings==


In another annual called the &quot;Gem&quot; appeared the verse story of Eugene Aram. Hood started a magazine in his own name, mainly sustained by his own activity. He did the work from a sick-bed from which he never rose, and there also composed well-known poems such as &quot;The Song of the Shirt&quot;, which appeared anonymously in the Christmas number of &quot;Punch&quot;, 1843 and was immediately reprinted in &quot;The Times&quot; and other newspapers across Europe. It was dramatised by Mark Lemon as &quot;The Sempstress&quot;, printed on broadsheets and cotton handkerchiefs, and was highly praised by many of the literary establishment, including Charles Dickens. Likewise &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Labourer&quot;, which were also translated into German by Ferdinand Freiligrath. These are plain, solemn pictures of the conditions of life, which appeared shortly before Hood&#x27;s death in May 1845.

Hood was associated with the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, started in 1828 by James Silk Buckingham, and was a regular contributor to it for the rest of his life. Prolonged illness brought straitened circumstances. Applications were made by a number of Hood&#x27;s friends to the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, to grant Hood a civil list pension, with which the state rewarded literary men. Peel was known to be an admirer of Hood&#x27;s work and in the last few months of Hood&#x27;s life he gave Jane Hood the sum of £100 without her husband&#x27;s knowledge, to alleviate the family&#x27;s debts. The pension that Peel&#x27;s government bestowed on Hood was continued to his wife and family after his death. Jane Hood, who also suffered from poor health, had put tremendous energy into tending her husband in his last year and died only 18 months later. The pension then ceased, but Peel&#x27;s successor Lord John Russell made arrangements for a £50 pension for the maintenance of Hood&#x27;s two children, Frances and Tom. Nine years later, a monument raised by public subscription in Kensal Green Cemetery was unveiled by Richard Monckton Milnes. The monument was originally surmounted by a bronze bust of Hood by the sculptor Matthew Noble and had circular inset bronze roundels on either side, but all have been stolen.

Thackeray, a friend of Hood&#x27;s, gave this assessment of him: &quot;Oh sad, marvellous picture of courage, of honesty, of patient endurance, of duty struggling against pain!... Here is one at least without guile, without pretension, without scheming, of a pure life, to his family and little modest circle of friends tenderly devoted.&quot;

The house where Hood died, No. 28 Finchley Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, now has a blue plaque.

==Examples of his works==
Hood wrote humorously on many contemporary issues. One of the main ones was grave robbing and selling of corpses to anatomists (see West Port murders). On this serious and perhaps cruel issue, he wrote wryly,
November in London is usually cool and overcast, and in Hood&#x27;s day subject to frequent smog. In 1844, he wrote the poem, &quot;No!&quot;:
An example of Hood&#x27;s reflective and sentimental verse is the famous &quot;I Remember, I Remember&quot;, given in full below:



Hood&#x27;s best known work in his lifetime was &quot;The Song of the Shirt&quot;, a verse lament for a London seamstress compelled to sell shirts she had made, the proceeds of which lawfully belonged to her employer, in order to feed her malnourished and ailing child. Hood&#x27;s poem appeared in one of the first editions of &quot;Punch&quot; in 1843 and quickly became a public sensation, being turned into a popular song and inspiring social activists in defence of countless industrious labouring women living in abject poverty.

<doc id="249115" wikidata="Q1275145" url="?curid=249115" title="Victor Herbert">
<text>Victor August Herbert (February 1, 1859 – May 26, 1924) was an American composer, cellist and conductor of English and Irish ancestry and German training. Although Herbert enjoyed important careers as a cello soloist and conductor, he is best known for composing many successful operettas that premiered on Broadway from the 1890s to World War I. He was also prominent among the Tin Pan Alley composers and was later a founder of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). A prolific composer, Herbert produced two operas, a cantata, 43 operettas, incidental music to 10 plays, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions and numerous songs, choral compositions and orchestrations of works by other composers, among other music.

In the early 1880s, Herbert began a career as a cellist in Vienna and Stuttgart, during which he began to compose orchestral music. Herbert and his opera singer wife, Therese Förster, moved to the U.S. in 1886 when both were engaged by the Metropolitan Opera. In the U.S., Herbert continued his performing career, while also teaching at the National Conservatory of Music, conducting and composing. His most notable instrumental compositions were his Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 (1894), which entered the standard repertoire, and his &quot;Auditorium Festival March&quot; (1901). He conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1898 to 1904 (taking over from founding conductor Frederic Archer) and then founded the Victor Herbert Orchestra, which he conducted throughout the rest of his life.

Herbert began to compose operettas in 1894, producing several successes, including &quot;The Serenade&quot; (1897) and &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; (1898). Some of the operettas that he wrote after the turn of the 20th century were even more successful: &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1903), &quot;Mlle. Modiste&quot; (1905), &quot;The Red Mill&quot; (1906), &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1910), &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1913) and &quot;Eileen&quot; (1917). After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose musicals and contributed music to other composers&#x27; shows. While some of these were well-received, he never again achieved the level of success that he had enjoyed with his most popular operettas.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Herbert was born on the island of Guernsey to Frances &quot;Fanny&quot; Muspratt (&quot;née&quot; Lover; c. 1833 – c. 1915) and August Herbert, of whom nothing is known. He was baptized on July 11, 1859, in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Freiburg, Baden, Germany. From 1853, Fanny was separated from her first husband, Frederic Muspratt, who divorced her in 1861 when he found out that she had conceived Herbert by another man. His mother told Herbert that he had been born in Dublin, and he believed this all his life, listing Ireland as his birthplace on his 1902 American naturalization petition and on his 1914 American passport application. Herbert appears to have had no knowledge of his half-sister Angela Lucy Winifred Muspratt, an artist (born 1851) or his half-brother, Frederic Percy (1853–1856). The Muspratts, a family of chemical industrialists in Liverpool, raised Angela after the divorce. Herbert and his mother lived with his maternal grandfather, the Irish novelist, playwright, poet and composer, Samuel Lover, from 1862 to 1866 in Sevenoaks, Kent, England. Lover welcomed a steady flow of musicians, writers and artists to their home. Herbert joined his mother in Stuttgart, Germany in 1867, a year after she had married a German physician, Carl Theodor Schmid of Langenargen. Herbert&#x27;s younger half-brother, Wilhelm Marius Schmid, was born there in 1870. In Stuttgart he received a strong liberal education at the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium, which included musical training.
Herbert initially planned to pursue a career as a medical doctor. Although his stepfather was related by blood to German royalty, his financial situation was not good by the time Herbert was a teenager. Medical education in Germany was expensive, and so Herbert focused instead on music. He initially studied the piano, flute and piccolo but ultimately settled on the cello, beginning studies on that instrument with Bernhard Cossmann from age 15 to age 18. He then attended the Stuttgart Conservatory. After studying cello, music theory and composition under Max Seifritz, Herbert graduated with a diploma in 1879.

===Early career and the move to the U.S.===
Even before studying with Cossmann, Herbert was engaged professionally as a player in concerts in Stuttgart. His first orchestra position was as a flute and piccolo player, but he soon turned solely to the cello. By the time he was 19, Herbert had received engagements as a soloist with several major German orchestras. He played in the orchestra of the wealthy Russian Baron Paul von Derwies for a few years and, in 1880, was a soloist for a year in the orchestra of Eduard Strauss in Vienna. Herbert joined the court orchestra in Stuttgart in 1881, where he remained for the next five years. There he composed his first pieces of instrumental music, playing the solos in the premieres of his first two large-scale works, the Suite for cello and orchestra, Op. 3 (1883) and the Cello Concerto No. 1, Op. 8. In 1883, Herbert was selected by Johannes Brahms to play in a chamber orchestra for the celebration of the life of Franz Liszt, then 72 years old, near Zurich.

In 1885 Herbert became romantically involved with Therese Förster (1861–1927), a soprano who had recently joined the court opera for which the court orchestra played. Förster sang several leading roles at the Stuttgart Opera in 1885 through the summer of 1886. After a year of courtship, the couple married on August 14, 1886. On October 24, 1886, they moved to the United States, as they both had been hired by Walter Damrosch and Anton Seidl to join the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Herbert was engaged as the opera orchestra&#x27;s principal cellist, and Förster was engaged to sing principal roles. During the voyage to America, Herbert and his wife became friends with their fellow passenger and future conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Anton Seidl, and other singers joining the Met.

===Initial musical life in New York City===

Seidl became an important mentor to Herbert and took a particular interest in fostering Herbert&#x27;s skills as a conductor. Upon arriving in New York, Herbert and Förster became active members of New York&#x27;s German music community, socializing and networking at cafes such as Luchow&#x27;s. At these cafes, Herbert handed out business cards saying, &quot;solo cellist from the Royal Orchestra of his Majesty, the King of Württemberg. Instructor in cello, vocal music and harmony.&quot; Herbert hoped to pick up extra income teaching, since he was earning only $40 to $50 a week as a cellist in the Met&#x27;s orchestra.

Meanwhile, in her first season at the Met, 1886–87, Förster sang several roles in German, including the title role of the Queen of Sheba in Goldmark&#x27;s &quot;Die Königin von Saba&quot;, Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, Irene in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Rienzi&quot;, the title role in the Met premiere of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and Elizabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. She earned praise from critics and audiences alike and was featured on the cover of the &quot;Musical Courier&quot;, a major music magazine of the day. The next season, she repeated the role of Elsa but then left the Met and then sang with the German-language Thalia Theatre, again earning good reviews. Although she sang for several more years, her career did not progress. Nevertheless, happy in New York, Herbert and Förster decided to remain in America after their first season at the Metropolitan Opera and eventually became citizens.

Herbert quickly became prominent in New York City&#x27;s musical scene, making his first American solo appearance on the cello in a performance of his own Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3, with Walter Damrosch conducting the Symphony Society of New York at the Metropolitan Opera House on January 8, 1887. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; said of the event, &quot;[Herbert&#x27;s] style is infinitely more easy and graceful than that of most cello players&quot;. This warm reception quickly led to more solo engagements that year, including performances of his own &quot;Berceuse&quot; and &quot;Polonais&quot;. Herbert continued to appear as a cello soloist with major American orchestras into the 1910s. In the fall of 1887, he formed his own 40-piece orchestra, the Majestic Orchestra Internationale, which he conducted and in which he served as cello soloist. Although the orchestra survived for only one season, it performed in several of New York&#x27;s most important concert halls. The same year, he founded the New York String Quartet together with violinists Sam Franko and Henry Boewig, and violist Ludwig Schenck. The group&#x27;s first concert was on December 8, 1887, and it continued to give free-admittance concerts for several years at Steinway Hall, earning enthusiastic critical praise.
During the Summer of 1888, Herbert became Seidl&#x27;s assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s ten-week summer concert seasons on the Boardwalk at Brighton Beach, a prestigious post. Seidl&#x27;s concert seasons made Brighton Beach an important New York musical venue each summer. Herbert conducted the 80-piece orchestra in lighter works paired with more serious repertoire at summer concerts and festivals over the next few years. Herbert&#x27;s association with the New York Philharmonic ended in 1898, after 11 seasons, serving variously as an assistant conductor, guest conductor and solo cellist. In Fall 1888, soprano Emma Juchs hired Herbert to music direct a &quot;concert party&quot; tour of cities and towns in the midwest that had seen little art music, presenting a quartet of singers in varied programs of songs, operatic scenes and arias to new audiences. The accompaniment was usually pianist Adele Aus de Ohe and Herbert at the cello. The group presented their concerts to wealthy patrons at fashionable private parties and at mostly smaller venues to local audiences, educating them about opera, art songs and contemporary music.

===Conducting and composing successes===
On December 1, 1888, Seidl programmed Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for String Orchestra, Op. 12&quot; as part of a concert at Steinway Hall, with the composer conducting. In January 1889, Herbert and violinist Max Bendix were the soloists in the American premiere of the challenging &quot;Double Concerto, Op. 102&quot; for Violin, Cello and Orchestra by Brahms. Conductor Theodore Thomas then invited Herbert to conduct and perform with him in Chicago. In 1889, Herbert formed the Metropolitan Trio Club with Bendix and pianist Reinhold L. Herman. The &quot;Musical Courier&quot; gave effusive praise to both Herbert&#x27;s compositions (&quot;refined taste, abundant melodic invention&quot;) and his playing: &quot;As a violoncellist, Mr. Herbert ranks with the foremost alive&quot;. Seidl brought Herbert, Förster, Bendix, Juchs, Ohe and Lilli Lehmann, together with a large orchestra and 500-voice chorus, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in May 1889 as part of a big music festival to celebrate the new Exposition Building.

Herbert also played and conducted for the Worcester Music Festival, where he returned repeatedly through the 1890s. In the autumn of 1889, Herbert also joined the faculty of the National Conservatory of Music, where he taught cello and music composition for several years. In 1890, he was appointed the conductor of the Boston Festival Orchestra, serving there in seasons through 1893, in addition to all of his conducting commitments elsewhere. In 1891, Herbert premiered an ambitious cantata, &quot;The Captive&quot;, for solo voices, chorus and full orchestra. His &quot;Irish Rhapsody&quot; (1892), written for the Gaelic Society of New York enjoyed a brief but intense period of popularity.
He became director of the 22nd Regimental Band of the New York National Guard in 1894, succeeding its founder, Patrick Gilmore and Gilmore&#x27;s unsuccessful immediate successor David Wallis Reeves. Herbert toured widely with the 22nd Regimental Band through 1900, performing both his own band compositions and works from the orchestral repertory that he transcribed for the band. Beginning in 1894, when he began composing operettas, Herbert&#x27;s band marches were sometimes derived from material from the operettas. Throughout his career, Herbert was well liked by orchestra players for his modesty and unpretentiousness. Herbert continued to compose orchestral music, writing one of his finest works, the Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30, which premiered in 1894.

In 1898, Herbert became the principal conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony, a position he held until 1904. Under his leadership, the orchestra became a major American ensemble and was favorably compared by music critics with ensembles like the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra toured to several major cities during Herbert&#x27;s years as conductor, notably premiering Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Auditorium Festival March&quot; for the celebration of the twelfth anniversary of Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Theatre in 1901. After a disagreement with the management of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1904, Herbert resigned, founding the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He conducted their programs of light orchestral music paired with more serious repertoire (as he had done earlier with Anton Seidl&#x27;s Brighton Beach orchestra concerts) at summer resorts and on tours for most of his remaining years. His orchestra made many acoustical recordings for both Edison Records, from 1909 to 1911, and the Victor Talking Machine Company, from 1911 to 1923. Herbert was also a cello soloist in several Victor recordings as well.

===Activist for the legal rights of composers===
In the early years of the twentieth century, Herbert championed the right of composers to profit from their works. In 1909, he testified before the United States Congress, influencing the formation and development of the Copyright Act of 1909. This law helped to secure the rights of composers to charge royalties on the sales of sound recordings.

Herbert led a group of composers and publishers in founding the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) on February 13, 1914, becoming its vice-president and director until his death in 1924. The organization has historically worked to protect the rights of songwriters and music publishers and continues to do this work today. In 1917, Herbert won a landmark lawsuit before the United States Supreme Court that gave composers, through ASCAP, a right to charge performance fees for the public performance of their music. ASCAP commissioned a bust in Herbert&#x27;s honor in New York City&#x27;s Central Park, erected in 1927.

===Operetta, opera and musical theatre===

In 1894 Herbert composed his first operetta, &quot;Prince Ananias&quot;, for a popular troupe known as The Bostonians. The piece was well received, and Herbert soon composed three more operettas for Broadway, &quot;The Wizard of the Nile&quot; (1895), &quot;The Serenade&quot; (1897), which enjoyed international success, and &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; (1898), starring Alice Nielsen. Although these achieved popularity, Herbert did not produce any more stage works for several years, focusing on his work with the Pittsburgh Symphony until 1904. Just before leaving that orchestra, he returned to Broadway with his first major hit, &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1903). Two more successes followed, &quot;Mlle. Modiste&quot; (1905) and &quot;The Red Mill&quot; (1906), which solidified Herbert as one of the best-known American composers. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1908.

Although Herbert&#x27;s reputation lies with his operettas, he also composed two grand operas. He searched for several years for a libretto that appealed to him, finally finding one by Joseph D. Redding called &quot;Natoma&quot; that concerned a historical story set in California. He composed the work from 1909 to 1910, and it premiered in Philadelphia on February 25, 1911, with soprano Mary Garden in the title role and the young Irish tenor John McCormack in his American operatic debut. The opera was repeated as part of the company&#x27;s repertory during the next three seasons. It also enjoyed performances in New York City, making its debut there on February 28, 1911. Herbert&#x27;s other opera, &quot;Madeleine&quot;, was a much lighter work in one act. On January 24, 1914, it had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, but it was not revived beyond that season.

During this period, Herbert continued to compose operettas, producing two of his most successful works, &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (1910) and &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1913). He also became progressively more involved with Irish-American organizations: in 1908 he joined the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick (becoming president in 1916), the oldest Irish association in New York, and in 1911 he became a member of the American Irish Historical Society. In early 1916, he became the founding president of the Friends of Irish Freedom and became active in the cause of Irish nationalism. Another operetta, &quot;Eileen&quot; (1917, originally entitled &quot;Hearts of Erin&quot;), was the fulfillment of Herbert&#x27;s desire to compose an Irish-themed operetta and a tribute to his grandfather&#x27;s novel &quot;Rory O&#x27;More&quot;. The piece is set during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and contains a rich score; it debuted in time to mark the first anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland. This was the end of Herbert&#x27;s greatest period of producing full scores for operettas. In late 1916 Herbert also orchestrated &quot;Soldiers of Erin&quot;, an English language version of what would later be adopted as the Irish national anthem; it was widely performed in the US from early 1917.
By World War I, with the birth of jazz, ragtime and new dance styles like the foxtrot and tango, Herbert reluctantly switched to writing musical comedies. These featured less elaborate ensembles and simpler songs for less classically trained singers than the European-style operettas that had dominated his earlier career. Herbert, during the last years of his career, was frequently asked to compose ballet music for the elaborate production numbers in Broadway revues and the shows of Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern, among others. He was also a contributor to the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; every year from 1917 to 1924.

Herbert summered at Lake Placid, New York. In 1918, he played the cello there (the first time after retiring 20 years earlier) in a benefit concert for the Red Cross.

==Death and legacy==
A healthy man throughout his life, Herbert died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 65 on May 26, 1924, shortly after his final show, &quot;The Dream Girl&quot;, began its pre-Broadway run in New Haven, Connecticut. He was survived by his wife and two children, Ella Victoria Herbert Bartlett and Clifford Victor Herbert. He was entombed in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Herbert and his music are celebrated in the 1939 film &quot;The Great Victor Herbert&quot;, where he was portrayed by Walter Connolly and which also featured Mary Martin. He was also portrayed by Paul Maxey in the 1946 film &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot;. Many of Herbert&#x27;s own works were made into films, and his music has been used in numerous films and television shows. In 1940 the U.S. Postal Service included Herbert in its Famous Americans series of stamps. A Chicago elementary school is named for him. During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor. Ireland&#x27;s RTÉ Lyric FM&#x27;s feature &quot;Victor Herbert, Son of Dublin&quot; was Silver Radio Winner at the 2019 New York Festivals International Radio Awards in the category best biographical documentary.

==Works==

Herbert was a prolific composer, producing two operas, one cantata, 43 operettas, incidental music to 10 stage productions, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions, one flute and clarinet duet with orchestra, numerous songs, including many for the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, and other works, 12 choral compositions, and numerous orchestrations of works by other composers, among other compositions. He also composed &quot;The Fall of a Nation&quot; (1916), one of the first original orchestral scores for a full-length film. The score was thought to be lost, but it turned up in the film-music collection of the Library of Congress. It was given a recording in 1987.
As a composer, Herbert is chiefly remembered for his operettas. Of his instrumental works, only a few remained consistently within the concert repertoire after Herbert&#x27;s death. However, some of his forgotten works have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity within the last couple decades.

===Operettas and other stage music===
Besides those mentioned above, other Herbert operettas with particularly strong scores are &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; (1899), &quot;The Singing Girl&quot; (1899), &quot;The Enchantress&quot; (1911), &quot;The Madcap Duchess&quot; (1913), and &quot;The Only Girl&quot; (1914). Other shows that were popular include &quot;It Happened in Nordland&quot; (1904), &quot;Miss Dolly Dollars&quot; (1905), &quot;Dream City&quot; (1906), &quot;The Magic Knight&quot; (1906), &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1908), &quot;The Lady of the Slipper&quot; (1912), &quot;The Princess Pat&quot; (1915) and &quot;My Golden Girl&quot; (1920). In addition to composing about 55 full scores for stage works, Herbert produced a considerable body of musical numbers for variety shows such as the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; and the sophisticated private entertainments for the Lambs theatrical club.

Herbert&#x27;s early shows toured widely, usually including a Broadway run to further publicize the tour. As Broadway increasingly became essential to commercial theatrical success, Herbert designed his shows to appeal specifically to New York sensibilities. Although consistently praised for his music, many of Herbert&#x27;s operettas were criticized by theatre critics for their weak librettos and conventional lyrics. By the mid-20th century, revivals of Herbert&#x27;s works were relatively rare. His shows were revived occasionally on Broadway until 1947, but not thereafter. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the operettas began to be revived more frequently, albeit often with heavily rewritten librettos, by companies like the Light Opera of Manhattan and Ohio Light Opera, and revivals continue today.

===Herbert&#x27;s style===
American musical theatre composers of the late nineteenth century tended to imitate either Viennese operetta or the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Many American theatre companies, such as The Bostonians, were established for the purpose of performing Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s operas, such as &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;The Mikado&quot;, and adaptations of Karl Millöcker&#x27;s operettas, such as &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot;, or Franz von Suppé&#x27;s &quot;Boccaccio&quot;, all of which became popular in America. Herbert tailored his operettas to be performed by companies that performed these works. His background made him intimately familiar with Viennese operetta. Indeed, the most characteristic Herbert song was the waltz, and many of his waltzes became highly popular in spite of their high musical demands.
Herbert is also known for his &quot;variation&quot; songs, which consist either of a series of refrains displaying different styles, or of several variations of the same melody. For example, &quot;Serenades of All Nations&quot; from &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; demonstrates serenades from colourful national traditions, sung and danced by a ballerina. &quot;The Song of the Poet&quot; from &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; provides variations on the lullaby &quot;Rock-a-bye Baby&quot; by presenting it first as a brassy march, then in Neapolitan style, and finally as a cakewalk. The best of Herbert&#x27;s operetta music is challenging, calling for trained singers. He often wrote his operettas with a particular singer in mind. During his career he had occasion to work with three great prima donnas: Alice Nielsen, Fritzi Scheff, and Emma Trentini. For them, he wrote leading parts in &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; and &quot;The Singing Girl&quot; (Nielsen), &quot;Babette&quot;, &quot;Mlle. Modiste&quot;, &quot;The Prima Donna&quot; and &quot;Mlle Rosita&quot; (Scheff), and &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; (Trentini). He would also write shows for popular comedians of the day or noted producers. Some of these were spectacular successes (&quot;The Red Mill&quot;, written for the comedy team of David C. Montgomery and Fred Stone, was Herbert&#x27;s most financially successful show.), while others were dismal failures (&quot;When Sweet Sixteen&quot;, written for Joe Weber, who pulled out of the production, which lasted only twelve performances on Broadway.).

Although Herbert had not been exposed to Gilbert and Sullivan before his arrival in the U.S. in 1886, their popularity led him to adopt some of their musical and dramatic sensibilities. An example of this is the quintet &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; from &quot;The Wizard of the Nile&quot;. One of his early successes, &quot;The Serenade&quot;, borrows many of its situations from &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, &quot;Iolanthe&quot; and &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;. The work&#x27;s librettist, Harry B. Smith, went on to steal more Gilbertian ideas for future operettas with Herbert, who often would complement these ideas with music reminiscent of Sullivan. &quot;The Singing Girl&quot;, co-written by Smith and Stanislaus Stange, recalls &quot;The Mikado&quot;, and includes the plot element of a law against kissing without a licence.
Herbert tended to use a slightly larger orchestra than Sullivan did in his comic operas, mostly through use of more types of percussion and occasionally by adding a harp. He generally wrote his own orchestrations, which were admired by music critics and other composers. In revivals of his works, however, new orchestrations have substituted saxophones and brass for strings. For many years, the only recording available of a Herbert show using his original orchestrations was one of &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, produced by the Smithsonian in 1981. Only recently have more recordings of his operettas appeared with the original orchestrations intact. These include &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, &quot;Mlle. Modiste&quot;, &quot;Eileen&quot;, &quot;Sweethearts&quot; and &quot;The Red Mill&quot; by Ohio Light Opera and &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; by The Comic Opera Guild, which also has recorded numerous Herbert operettas live in concert with two-piano accompaniment.

Like Sullivan, Herbert also frequently evokes and imitates music from distant places in his operettas. He uses elements of Spanish music in &quot;The Serenade&quot;, Italian music in &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;, Austrian music in &quot;The Singing Girl&quot; and Eastern music in &quot;The Wizard of the Nile&quot;, &quot;The Idol&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;The Tattooed Man&quot; and other works set in places like Egypt and India. &quot;The Fortune Teller&quot; includes an energetic Hungarian csárdás. He also frequently interpolated Irish-style songs into his operettas which, with the exception of those in &quot;Eileen&quot;, rarely advanced the plot.

By World War I, musical tastes were shifting in America, and Herbert was forced to compose in a simpler musical style. Many of his later works, such as &quot;The Velvet Lady&quot; and &quot;Angel Face&quot; (both 1919), imitated popular new song-types like the foxtrot, ragtime and the tango. Even in some of his earlier works, such as &quot;The Red Mill&quot; (1906), Herbert was already adopting elements that would later become associated with musical comedy in America. His collaboration on &quot;The Century Girl&quot; (1916) with Irving Berlin displayed this simpler style. Although these later shows introduced some memorable numbers, they did not enjoy the enduring popularity of his most popular operettas. The most successful work of his later career was &quot;Orange Blossoms&quot; (1921), which included the popular waltz song, &quot;A Kiss in the Dark&quot;.

===Operas===

Although his success had been in light music, like Sullivan, Herbert aspired to compose serious operas. Approached by Oscar Hammerstein I to write a grand opera, Herbert jumped at the chance. Hammerstein announced, in the April 13, 1907 issue of &quot;Musical America&quot;, a $1,000 prize for the best libretto submitted, fueling public enthusiasm and high expectations. Joseph Redding&#x27;s libretto for &quot;Natoma&quot;, set in 1820s California, is a love story between an American naval officer and a Native American princess. The cast included such distinguished singers as John McCormack and Mary Garden, but the 1911 premiere in Philadelphia was only a moderate success. Critics praised the music, including its effective melodies and leitmotifs set off by orchestral counterpoint. They complained, however, about the libretto and the casting of foreign singers in what was supposed to be an &quot;American opera&quot;.

&quot;Madeleine&quot;, his only other opera, is based on a French play and tells the equable little story of an operatic prima donna whose friends and acquaintances, one by one, decline her invitation to dine with her on New Years Day. The work is in one act and premiered in 1914 in a double bill with Enrico Caruso in the leading tenor role in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. The opera featured Frances Alda in the title role. It failed to make an impression and received only six performances. Its conversational style is complemented by orchestral motivic commentary. Just before the work opened, Herbert added &quot;A Perfect Day&quot; at Alda&#x27;s request. Although not a success, because of Herbert&#x27;s popularity, G. Schirmer took the unprecedented step of publishing the work in full score.

===Instrumental music===
After Herbert&#x27;s death, little of his instrumental music continued to be performed, but within the last couple of decades it has begun to enjoy revivals in concert and recordings. His &quot;Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30&quot;, is an exception to this. First performed in 1894, it was received enthusiastically at its premiere and shows the influence of Franz Liszt. Antonín Dvořák, a colleague of Herbert&#x27;s at the National Conservatory, was inspired to compose his Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, after hearing its premiere. The concerto has been recorded by cellists such as Yo-Yo Ma (with Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic), Lynn Harrell (with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields), Julian Lloyd Webber (with Sir Charles Mackerras and the London Symphony Orchestra), and an early rare recording by Bernard Greenhouse (with Max Schönherr and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra).
More recently, two of Herbert&#x27;s earlier compositions for cello and orchestra have regained a place in the concert repertory. The Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3 (1884), his earliest known composition despite its designation as Op. 3, has been performed by several ensembles in recent years. The work foreshadows the light music of Herbert&#x27;s later compositions. Another work that has been revived is his Cello Concerto No. 1, which was first performed by the composer in Stuttgart shortly before he came to the U.S. For many years, the work was unpublished and apparently unperformed, surviving only in manuscript. It was recorded for the first time in 1986 and has since been published. The composition is admired for achieving an effective balance between its virtuosic elements and its lyricism.

Of his large-scale orchestral works, Herbert&#x27;s tone poem &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; (1901) is his most important. Composed for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra while Herbert was their conductor, the work displays an affinity with both Wagner and Liszt. Another important work that Herbert wrote for the PSO is &quot;Columbus&quot;, Op. 35, a four-movement programmatic suite. The first and final movements of the suite were composed in 1893 as part of a theatrical spectacle intended for the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. However, Herbert never completed that project, and the central two movements were not composed until 1902. The PSO premiered the work in 1903, and it was the last large-scale symphonic work that Herbert composed.

Herbert also composed a considerable body of smaller-scale works, often writing music for his own performance on the cello or producing individual songs for the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He published some of his dance music compositions under the pseudonym Noble MacClure. During the last decade of his life, he composed a number of overtures for feature films, although &quot;The Fall of a Nation&quot; was his only complete film score. On February 12, 1924, Herbert was one of the featured composers at New York&#x27;s Aeolian Hall, in an evening entitled &quot;An Experiment in Modern Music&quot; that included the world premiere of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; by the Paul Whiteman orchestra. Herbert&#x27;s contribution for the evening, &quot;A Suite of Serenades&quot;, was his last work to premiere with him in attendance.

<doc id="249116" wikidata="Q257106" url="?curid=249116" title="Liquorice">
<text>Liquorice (Commonwealth English) or licorice (American English; see spelling differences; ) is the common name of Glycyrrhiza glabra, a flowering plant of the bean family Fabaceae, from the root of which a sweet, aromatic flavouring is extracted.

The liquorice plant is an herbaceous perennial legume native to West Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe. Liquorice is used as a flavouring in confectionery, tobacco, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, and is marketed as a dietary supplement.

Liquorice extracts have been used in herbalism and traditional medicine. Excessive consumption of liquorice (more than per day of pure glycyrrhizinic acid, a key component of liquorice) can lead to undesirable consequences. Clinically, it is suspected that overindulgence in liquorice may manifest as unexplained hypertension, low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), and muscle weakness in individuals. Consuming liquorice should be avoided during pregnancy.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&quot; (UK, CAN), or &quot;&quot; (US), is derived via the Anglo-French , from Late Latin , itself ultimately derived from Greek (the Modern Greek spelling of the genus is ) literally meaning &#x27;sweet root&#x27; and referring to &quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot;.

The latter gives the plant binomial name with &quot;glabra&quot; meaning &quot;smooth&quot; and referring to the plant&#x27;s smooth husks; the former came to being via the influence of , &#x27;to become fluid&#x27;, reflecting the method of extracting the sweet component from the roots.

, its English common name is spelled &#x27;liquorice&#x27; in most of the Commonwealth, but &#x27;licorice&#x27; is also used in some countries.

== Description ==
Liquorice is a herbaceous perennial, growing to in height, with pinnate leaves about long, with 9–17 leaflets. The flowers are long, purple to pale whitish blue, produced in a loose inflorescence. The fruit is an oblong pod, long, containing several seeds. The roots are stoloniferous.

== Chemistry ==

Liquorice root contains triterpenoids, polyphenols, and polysaccharides. Flavonoids account for the yellow root color. The principal glycoside, glycyrrhizin, exists in content of 7% to 10%, depending on cultivation practices. The isoflavene glabrene and the isoflavane glabridin, found in the roots of liquorice, are phytoestrogens.

The scent of liquorice root comes from a complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is some 3% of total volatiles. Much of the sweetness in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has 30–50 times the sweetness of sugar. The sweetness is different from sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.

== Cultivation and uses ==
Liquorice grows best in well-drained soils in deep valleys with full sun. It is harvested in the autumn two to three years after planting. Countries producing liquorice include Turkey, Greece, Iran, and Iraq.

===Tobacco===
Liquorice is used as a flavouring agent for tobacco, for flavour-enhancing and moistening agents in the manufacture of American blend cigarettes, moist snuff, chewing tobacco, and pipe tobacco. Liquorice provides tobacco products with a natural sweetness and a distinctive flavour that blends readily with the natural and imitation flavouring components employed in the tobacco industry. Liquorice can also be added to cigarette rolling papers. , the US Food and Drug Administration banned the use of any &quot;characterizing flavors&quot; other than menthol from cigarettes, but not other manufactured tobacco products.

===Food and confectionery===

Liquorice flavour is found in a wide variety of candies or sweets. In most of these candies, the taste is reinforced by aniseed oil so the actual content of liquorice is low.

In the Netherlands, liquorice confectionery (&quot;drop&quot;) is a common sweet sold in many forms. Mixing it with mint, menthol, aniseed, or laurel is common. It is also mixed with ammonium chloride (); salmiak liquorice in the Netherlands is known as (&#x27;salty liquorice&#x27;). Strong, salty sweets are also consumed in Nordic countries where liquorice flavoured alcohols are sold, particularly in Denmark and Finland.

Dried sticks of the liquorice root are a traditional confectionery in the Netherlands as were they once in Britain. They were sold simply as sticks of (&#x27;sweet wood&#x27;) to chew on as a candy.

Pontefract in Yorkshire, England, is where liquorice mixed with sugar began to be used as a sweet in the contemporary way. Pontefract cakes were originally made there. In Cumbria, County Durham, Yorkshire and Lancashire, it is colloquially known as &#x27;Spanish&#x27;, supposedly because Spanish monks grew liquorice root at Rievaulx Abbey near Thirsk.

In Italy, Spain and France, liquorice is used in its natural form. The root of the plant is simply harvested, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, unsweetened liquorice is consumed in the form of small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract. In Calabria, a liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract and in Reggio Emilia a soft drink called acqua d&#x27;orcio is made. In some parts of the Arab world, including Syria, Egypt, and Palestine, it is consumed as a cold beverage, especially in Ramadan.

In southeastern Turkey, such as in Diyarbakır, licorice root is traditionally made into a chilled beverage that is most commonly consumed in summer.

===Research===
Properties of glycyrrhizin are under preliminary research, such as for hepatitis C or topical treatment of psoriasis, but the low quality of studies prevents conclusions about efficacy and safety.

===Traditional medicine===
In traditional Chinese medicine, a related species &quot;G. uralensis&quot; (often translated as &quot;liquorice&quot;) is known as (), and is believed to &quot;harmonize&quot; the ingredients in a formula. although there is no high-quality clinical research to indicate it is safe or effective for any medicinal purpose. The European Medical Agency added liquorice to their list of herbal medicine.

===Fungicide===
The essential oils inhibit the growth of &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;.

==Adverse effects==
===Consumption levels===
The United States Food and Drug Administration regards that foods containing liquorice and its derivatives (including glycyrrhizin) are generally recognized as safe for use as a food ingredient, if not consumed excessively. Other jurisdictions have suggested no more than of glycyrrhizin per day, the equivalent of about of liquorice confectionery. Although liquorice is considered safe as a food ingredient, glycyrrhizin can cause serious side effects if consumed in large amounts (above 0.2 mg per kg per day). One estimate is that a normal healthy person can consume of glycyrrhizic acid per day.

Because the composition of liquorice extracts in various products may exist in a broad range, there is not enough scientific information to determine that a specific level of intake is safe or unsafe.

===Physiological effects===
The effects of excessive liquorice consumption on lowering potassium levels in the blood and increasing blood pressure are a particular concern for people with hypertension (high blood pressure) or heart or kidney disease.

Some adverse effects of liquorice consumed in amounts of 50 to 200 g per day over four weeks appear to be caused by glycyrrhizic acid (75 to 540 mg per day glycyrrhetinic acid) causing increases in blood pressure. Consuming large amounts of liquorice during pregnancy has been associated with premature birth and health problems in the child. 

Hyper-mineralocorticosteroid syndrome can occur when the body retains sodium, and loses potassium, altering biochemical and hormonal regulation. Some of these activities may include raised aldosterone levels, decline of the renin-angiotensin system and increased levels of the atrial natriuretic hormone in order to compensate the variations in homoeostasis.

Other adverse effects may include electrolyte imbalance, edema, increased blood pressure, weight gain, heart problems, and weakness. Symptoms depend on the severity of toxicity. Some other complaints include fatigue, shortness of breath, kidney failure, and paralysis.

===Potential for toxicity===
The major dose-limiting toxicities of liquorice are corticosteroid in nature, because of the inhibitory effect that its chief active constituents, glycyrrhizin and enoxolone, have on cortisol degradation, and include edema, hypokalaemia, weight gain or loss, and hypertension.

<text>Joseph Franklin Rutherford (November 8, 1869 – January 8, 1942), also known as Judge Rutherford, was an American religious leader and the second president of the incorporated Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. He played a primary role in the organization and doctrinal development of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which emerged from the Bible Student movement established by Charles Taze Russell.

Rutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 8th/14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society&#x27;s board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot;, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.

Rutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the current beliefs and practices of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement, which he later called a theocracy, requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their preaching activity. He also instituted training programs for public speaking as part of their weekly meetings for worship. He established 1914 as the date of Christ&#x27;s invisible return, asserted that Christ died on a tree rather than a cross, formulated the current Witness concept of Armageddon as God&#x27;s war on the wicked, and reinforced the belief that the start of Christ&#x27;s millennial reign was imminent. He condemned the observance of traditional celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays, the saluting of national flags and the singing of national anthems. He introduced the name &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot; in 1931 and the term &quot;Kingdom Hall&quot; for houses of worship in 1935.

He wrote twenty-one Watch Tower Society books and was credited by the Society in 1942 with the distribution of almost 400 million books and booklets. Despite significant decreases during the 1920s, overall membership increased more than sixfold by the end of Rutherford&#x27;s 25 years as president.

==Early life==

Rutherford was born on November 8, 1869, to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as Boonville, Missouri, but according to his death certificate he was born in Versailles, Missouri. Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.

===Law career===
Rutherford spent two years as a judge&#x27;s intern, became an official court reporter at age 20, and was admitted to The Missouri Bar in May 1892 at age 22. He became a trial lawyer for a law firm and later served for four years in Boonville as a public prosecutor. He campaigned briefly for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. He was appointed as a Special Judge in the 8th/14th Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri, sitting as a substitute judge at least once when a regular judge was unable to hold court. As a result of this appointment he became known by the sobriquet Judge Rutherford. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1909 and admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States the same year.

==Watch Tower Society==

In 1894, Rutherford purchased the first three volumes of Charles Taze Russell&#x27;s &quot;Millennial Dawn&quot; series of Bible study textbooks from two colporteurs who visited his office. Rutherford, who then viewed all religions as insincere, shallow and hypocritical, was struck by Russell&#x27;s sincerity and his sentiments towards religion, which mirrored his own view. Rutherford immediately wrote to the Watch Tower Society to express appreciation for the books. He was baptized twelve years later and he and his wife began holding Bible classes in their home. In 1907, he became legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society at its Pittsburgh headquarters, and from around that time began to give public talks as a &quot;pilgrim&quot; representative of the Society. 

As Russell&#x27;s health deteriorated, Rutherford represented him on trips to Europe. In April 1915 he was deputized to speak at a major debate with Baptist preacher J. H. Troy over four nights in Los Angeles before an audience of 12,000, debating various subjects, including the state of the dead, hellfire and Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. Rutherford wrote a pamphlet, &quot;A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens&quot;, in defense of Russell and served as chairman of the Bible Students&#x27; Los Angeles convention in September 1916.

===Board of directors===
By 1916, Rutherford had become one of the seven directors of the Watch Tower Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916, he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January. He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run &quot;The Watch Tower&quot; from the December 15, 1916, issue. Russell&#x27;s will, drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.

Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, who served as an aide to the executive committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society&#x27;s officers approached. He wrote: &quot;A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held a large number of votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office.&quot; 

Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, &quot;Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn&#x27;t do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord&#x27;s will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself had nothing to do with it.&quot;

===Presidency dispute===

On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.

By June, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford&#x27;s expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board&#x27;s authority from the president. Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society&#x27;s official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford. The pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford&#x27;s. 

On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.

The controversy fractured the Bible Student movement and some congregations split into opposing groups loyal either to Rutherford or those he had expelled. By mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford&#x27;s leadership, and over the following decade they helped form or joined other groups including the Stand Fast Movement, the Layman&#x27;s Home Missionary Movement, the Dawn Bible Students Association, the Pastoral Bible Institute, the Elijah Voice Movement, the Concordant Publishing Concern, and the Eagle Society.

==&quot;The Finished Mystery&quot;==
In late 1916, Fisher and another prominent Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee&#x27;s approval to produce a book about the prophecies of the books of Revelation and Ezekiel based primarily on Russell&#x27;s writings. Work on the book, &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot;, proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.

The book, which was misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell&#x27;s &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;, was denounced by Rutherford&#x27;s opponents, but became a best-seller and was translated into six languages and serialized in &quot;The Watch Tower&quot;. Expecting God&#x27;s Kingdom to establish rule on earth and for the saints to be raised to heaven in 1918, Rutherford wrote in January of that year: &quot;The Christian looks for the year to bring the full consummation of the church&#x27;s hopes.&quot; He embarked on a vast advertising campaign to expose the &quot;unrighteousness&quot; of religions and their alliances with &quot;beastly&quot; governments, expanding on claims in &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; that patriotism was a delusion and murder. 

The campaign attracted the attention of governments and on February 12, 1918, the book was banned by the Canadian government for what a Winnipeg newspaper described as &quot;seditious and antiwar statements&quot;. On February 24 in Los Angeles Rutherford gave a talk entitled &quot;The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die&quot; (subsequent talks in the series were renamed, &quot;Millions Now Living &quot;Will&quot; Never Die&quot;) in which he attacked the clergy, declaring: &quot;As a class, according to the Scriptures, the clergymen are the most reprehensible men on earth for the great war that is now afflicting mankind.&quot; Three days later the Army Intelligence Bureau seized the Society&#x27;s Los Angeles offices and confiscated literature.

===Imprisonment and release===
In early May 1918, US Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory condemned &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; as &quot;one of the most dangerous examples of ... propaganda ... a work written in extremely religious language and distributed in enormous numbers&quot;. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower directors, who were charged under the 1917 Espionage Act with attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, refusal of duty in the armed forces and obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service of the U.S. while it was at war. 

On June 21, seven of them, including Rutherford, were sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would gain control of the Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919, he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before, convincing him that God wanted him in the position. On March 26, 1919, the directors were released on bail after an appeals court ruled they had been wrongly convicted; in May 1920 the government announced that all charges had been dropped.

==Reorganization==

===Administrative changes===

Following his release from prison, Rutherford began a major reorganization of Bible Student activities. At a May 1919 convention in Ohio he announced the publication of a new magazine, &quot;The Golden Age&quot; (later renamed &quot;Awake!&quot;). Because Russell&#x27;s will had decreed the Society should publish no other periodicals the new magazine was at first published by &quot;Woodworth, Hudgings &amp; Martin&quot;, with a Manhattan (rather than Brooklyn) address. Within months Bible Students were organized to distribute it door-to-door. He expanded the Society&#x27;s printing facilities, revived the colporteur work and in 1920 introduced the requirement for weekly reports of Bible Students&#x27; preaching activity. He expanded and reorganized overseas branch offices in what he regarded as a &quot;cleansing&quot; and &quot;sifting&quot; work.

Beginning with an eight-day convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922 Rutherford, launched a series of major international conventions under the theme &quot;Advertise the King and Kingdom&quot;, attracting crowds of up to 20,000. Audiences were urged to &quot;herald the message far and wide&quot;. He stressed that the primary duty of all Bible Students was to become &quot;publicity agents&quot; in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14, especially in the form of door-to-door evangelism with the Society&#x27;s publications. In 1928 Rutherford began to teach that the Cedar Point convention and the events resulting from it fulfilled the prophecy of the 1290 days at Daniel 12:11.

In 1920, Rutherford published a booklet, &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;, and a year later published his first hardcover book, &quot;The Harp of God&quot;. This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as &quot;Creation&quot; (1927), &quot;Jehovah&quot; (1934) and &quot;Children&quot; (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies. In 1925, he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, &quot;Birth of the Nation&quot;, which contained significant doctrinal changes. 

Rutherford later claimed Satan had &quot;tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort&quot;; In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell&#x27;s &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot;. The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every leading article in &quot;The Watch Tower&quot; until his death. The 1933 Watch Tower Society &quot;Yearbook&quot; observed that the demise of the Editorial Committee indicated &quot;that the Lord himself is running his organization&quot;.

Rutherford expanded his means of spreading the Watch Tower message in 1924 with the start of 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on Staten Island, and eventually via a network of as many as 480 radio stations. A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the NBC and BBC radio networks banning his broadcasts.

In 1928, Rutherford began to abolish the system of electing elders by congregational voting, dismissing them as &quot;haughty&quot; and &quot;lazy&quot;, and finally asserting in 1932 that electing elders was unscriptural. He impressed on elders the need to obey the Society&#x27;s &quot;regulations&quot;, &quot;instructions&quot; and &quot;directions&quot; without complaint. Service directors, who reported back to Brooklyn, were appointed in each congregation and a weekly &quot;service meeting&quot; introduced to meeting programs. In 1933 Rutherford claimed that abolishing elective elders was a fulfillment of the prophecy of 2300 days at Daniel 8:13–14, and that God&#x27;s sanctuary (the Watch Tower Society) was thereby cleansed.

At a 1931 Bible Student assembly in Columbus, Ohio, Rutherford proposed a new name for the organization, &quot;Jehovah&#x27;s witnesses&quot;, to differentiate them from the proliferation of other groups that followed Russell&#x27;s teachings. Bible Students who opposed or abandoned Rutherford to form new groups were increasingly described as the &quot;evil servant class&quot; by &quot;The Watchtower&quot;, which said it was wrong to pray for those who were &quot;unfaithful&quot;. Four years later the term &quot;Kingdom Hall&quot; was introduced for the local meeting place of congregations.

In 1937, the door-to-door preaching program was extended to formally include &quot;back calls&quot; on interested people and Witnesses were urged to start one-hour Bible studies in the homes of householders. In the late 1930s, he advocated the use of &quot;sound cars&quot; and portable phonographs with which talks by Rutherford were played to passersby and householders.

In 1938, he introduced the term &quot;theocracy&quot; to describe the denomination&#x27;s system of government, with &quot;Consolation&quot; explaining: &quot;The Theocracy is at present administered by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of which Judge Rutherford is the president and general manager.&quot; &quot;Zone servants&quot; (now known as &quot;circuit overseers&quot;) were appointed to supervise congregations. In a &quot;Watchtower&quot; article Rutherford declared the need for congregations to &quot;get in line&quot; with the changed structure.

By 1942, the year of his death, worldwide attendance at the annual Memorial of Christ&#x27;s death was 140,450 though his restructuring of the Bible Student community coincided with a dramatic loss of followers during the 1920s and 1930s. Worldwide attendance of the annual Memorial of Christ&#x27;s death fell from 90,434 in 1925 to 17,380 in 1928. Memorial attendance figures did not surpass 90,000 again until 1940. Author Tony Wills, who analyzed attendance and &quot;field worker&quot; statistics, suggests it was the &quot;more dedicated&quot; Bible Students who quit through the 1920s, to be replaced by newcomers in larger numbers, although Rutherford dismissed the loss of the original Bible Students as the Lord &quot;shaking out&quot; the unfaithful. In the &quot;1942 Yearbook of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;, Rutherford wrote that the year&#x27;s achievements &quot;would, on the face of it, show that the Theocratic witness work on earth is about done&quot;.

===Doctrinal changes===

In July 1917, Rutherford had &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot; published as a seventh volume of the &quot;Studies in the Scriptures&quot; series. The volume, though written by Fisher and Woodworth, was advertised as Russell&#x27;s &quot;posthumous work&quot; and &quot;last legacy&quot; but contained several interpretations and viewpoints not espoused by Russell, including an urging of all Bible Students to cast judgment upon Christendom and its clergy, the adoption of new dates for the fulfillment of particular prophecies, a claim that salvation is tied to membership within the Watch Tower Society, as well as shunning and censuring any who reject the interpretations given in the volume or related articles in &quot;Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower&quot; magazine.

 In the February 1918 discourse &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot; (printed in booklet form in May 1920) a revision of Russell&#x27;s calculation of a &quot;Jubilee type&quot; was presented, changing it from 1875 to 1925, despite Russell&#x27;s rejection of such a change a few months prior to his death. In October 1920 the Society published a new edition of Russell&#x27;s 1881 &quot;Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices&quot;. It included an appendix introducing many alterations or reinterpretations of Russell&#x27;s original views on the death of Jesus and the role of Christ&#x27;s followers in heaven as typified in the ceremonies of the Jewish tabernacle.

At the 1922 Cedar Point convention Rutherford began teaching that Christ&#x27;s reign had begun in 1914, and not 1878 as Russell had taught. Rutherford expanded on this view in the March 1, 1925, issue of &quot;The Watch Tower&quot; in the article &quot;Birth of The Nation&quot;, which he later acknowledged &quot;caused a real stir or shake-up within the ranks.&quot; In 1927 he moved the date of the resurrection of the &quot;sleeping saints&quot; (all Christians who had died since Jesus&#x27; time) from 1878 to 1918 and as early as 1930 began to dismiss the year 1874 as the date for the invisible presence of Christ in favor of the year 1914.

From 1925 he developed the view of the battle of Armageddon as a universal war waged by God rather than Russell&#x27;s belief that it was the decline of human society into social, political and religious anarchy. Rutherford based his interpretations on the books of Exodus, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Psalms as well as additional material from the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. An article in the January 1, 1926 &quot;Watch Tower&quot; introduced new emphasis on the importance of the name &quot;Jehovah&quot;; from 1929 Rutherford taught that the vindication of God&#x27;s name—which would ultimately occur when millions of unbelievers were destroyed at Armageddon—was the primary doctrine of Christianity and more important than God&#x27;s display of goodness or grace toward humankind. In 1932 he published an interpretation of a passage in Ezekiel describing the attack on Jerusalem by Gog of Magog, in which he predicted an intensification of persecution of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses that would culminate in God intervening on their behalf to begin the battle of Armageddon, which would destroy all opposers of God&#x27;s organization.

In 1926, he discredited Russell&#x27;s teaching on the importance of Christian &quot;character development&quot; or personal &quot;sanctification&quot; and a year later discarded the teaching that Russell had been the &quot;faithful and wise servant&quot; of Matthew 24:45–47, warning that the desire to revere men was a snare set by the Devil. In May 1926 Rutherford released his book &quot;Deliverance&quot; at the Bible Student&#x27;s convention in Kensington, England later interpreting the event as the fulfillment of the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12.

In 1927, Christmas was declared to be of pagan origin, and the following year its celebration by Bible Students was condemned as supporting &quot;Satan&#x27;s organization&quot;. Mother&#x27;s Day was condemned in 1931, with other holidays as well as birthdays officially renounced in subsequent years.

In 1928, Rutherford discarded Russell&#x27;s teaching that the natural Jews would be restored to Palestine and return to God&#x27;s favor, despite having declared ten years earlier that prophecies of their restoration were already being fulfilled with the British takeover of Palestine from Turkey during World War I. He denied there was a role for Jews in God&#x27;s Kingdom arrangement and by 1933 he had reversed Russell&#x27;s earlier teaching, claiming that prominent Jewish business leaders were &quot;arrogant, self-important and extremely selfish,&quot; and would gain no favored standing with God. The teaching that God would restore the Jews to Palestine was discontinued around the same time.

Russell&#x27;s teaching that the Great Pyramid of Giza was built under God&#x27;s direction was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted that it had been built under the direction of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God&#x27;s people in the last days. The announcement prompted further defections among long-time Bible Students.

In 1930, Rutherford published a systematic reinterpretation of the book of Revelation. Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.

At a Washington, D.C. convention in 1935, Rutherford rejected Russell&#x27;s teaching that the &quot;great company&quot; of Revelation 7:9 was a &quot;secondary spiritual class&quot; composed of millions of Christians who would be resurrected to heaven apart from the 144,000 &quot;elect&quot;, and instead argued that the &quot;great multitude&quot;, the &quot;sheep&quot; of Matthew 25 and the &quot;Jonadabs&quot; of 2 Kings chapter 10 all picture the people who could potentially survive Armageddon and receive everlasting human life on earth if they became Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses before it began.

In 1935, Rutherford objected to U.S. state laws requiring school students to salute the flag as a means of instilling patriotism; in the 1936 &quot;Yearbook&quot; he declared that baptized Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who did salute the flag were breaking their covenant with God and were thus &quot;guilty of death&quot;. In 1940, children in 43 states were expelled for refusing to salute the flag and the Watch Tower Society took most cases to court, with Rutherford personally leading the unsuccessful case of Minersville School District v. Gobitis. Controversy over the flag salute issue escalated and mob attacks became prevalent in many U.S. states until 1943 when the court overruled its previous decision in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. A U.S. law magazine noted how Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had helped shape the course of constitutional law, remarking: &quot;Through almost constant litigation this organization had made possible an ever-increasing list of precedents concerning the application of the 14th amendment to freedom of speech and religion&quot;.

In 1936, Rutherford rejected the belief that Jesus had been executed on a Roman cross, in favor of an upright stake or &quot;tree.&quot;

==Character and attitudes==
Biographers describe Rutherford as tall and solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, and a strong booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Rutherford &quot;has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker&quot;. Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Watchtower history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford &quot;was warm and generous toward his associates but he was also a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense.&quot; 

Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, &quot;His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood.&quot; Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford &quot;spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what he had to say was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death.&quot; Macmillan added, &quot;He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth.&quot; 

Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford&#x27;s abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with &quot;a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil&quot;, while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a &quot;dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance.&quot;

Rutherford&#x27;s confrontation with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness of his personality and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played &quot;hard-fisted church politics&quot; and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using &quot;The Watchtower&quot; as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At the heart of his opponents&#x27; complaints was his &quot;autocratic&quot; behavior as he strove to &quot;exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs.&quot; 

Penton similarly describes Rutherford&#x27;s actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society&#x27;s accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish &quot;The Finished Mystery&quot;—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, &quot;It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord.&quot; Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and &quot;did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society&#x27;s charter&quot;.

According to Wills, Rutherford emerged from prison in 1919 bitter against the world and the collusion he saw between the clergy and military that had secured his imprisonment. Soon after his release he coined the term &quot;Satan&#x27;s organization&quot; to refer to this supposed conspiracy. In &quot;Watchtower&quot; articles Rutherford was similarly scathing towards big business, politics and the League of Nations. Rogerson describes Rutherford&#x27;s attitude towards the clergy—his avowed enemies—as &quot;unadulterated hatred&quot;. 

His attacks on clergymen, particularly those of the Catholic Church, from the late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by the NBC radio network, which condemned his &quot;rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy&quot;. He also applied criticizing terms to those who had deserted Watch Tower ranks, calling them the &quot;evil servant&quot;. He urged readers to view with contempt anyone who had &quot;openly rebelled against God&#x27;s order or commandments&quot; and also described elective elders of the 1930s who refused to submit to Watch Tower Society administrative changes as &quot;despicable&quot;.

Wills states that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He claims that towards the close of his ministry Rutherford spent about half of each year&#x27;s &quot;Watchtowers&quot; writing about Armageddon.

According to Penton, Rutherford&#x27;s austerity—evidenced by his distaste for Christmas, birthday parties and other popular customs that were described as of pagan origin or that encouraged idolatry and were not to be observed—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings; singing was reinstated soon after his death.

Rutherford&#x27;s books and magazine articles reveal his strong views on &quot;the proper place of women&quot; in the church and society. In a 1931 book he linked the post-1919 rise of women&#x27;s movements that encouraged equality of the sexes with satanic influence, and claimed the custom of men tipping their hats to women or standing when a woman approached was a scheme of the devil to turn men from God and indicated an effeminate streak in men who practiced the custom. Mother&#x27;s Day was similarly described as part of a plan to turn people away from God. In 1938 he urged adherents to delay marriage and child-bearing until after Armageddon, which Wills claims prompted a strong community bias among Witnesses against marriage. Those who did marry, says Wills, were considered to be weak in faith. At a 1941 convention in Missouri he quoted Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s description of women as &quot;a rag and a bone and a hank of hair&quot;.

Former Jehovah&#x27;s Witness and former Governing Body member Raymond Franz claimed there was no evidence Rutherford engaged in door-to-door ministry despite his assertion that it was a requirement and sacred duty of all Witnesses. Franz claimed to have heard Rutherford&#x27;s associates say his responsibilities as president &quot;do not permit his engaging in this activity&quot;. Macmillan, however, related details of Rutherford&#x27;s home preaching in 1905 or 1906 when he was baptized, and a 1975 article quoted several Witnesses relating their experiences with Rutherford in the house-to-house ministry in the 1920s. The official history of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also notes, &quot;Rutherford personally shared with other conventioners as they engaged in the work of Kingdom proclamation from house to house.&quot; On August 2, 1928, in a meeting with the Bible Student elders who had attended a general convention in Detroit, Michigan Rutherford listed his responsibilities and concluded &quot;when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door.&quot;

Authors William Whalen and James Penton have claimed that Rutherford was to Russell what Brigham Young was to Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Penton contends that both Russell and Smith were capable religious leaders but naive visionaries, while Rutherford and Young were &quot;hard-bitten pragmatists who gave a degree of permanency to the movements they dominated&quot;.

==Personal life==

Rutherford, a Baptist, married Mary Malcolm Fetzer, a Presbyterian, in Boonville, Missouri, on December 31, 1891. Around the time of the marriage, Rutherford became an atheist. Their only child, Malcolm, was born on November 10, 1892. The couple joined the Bible Student movement in the early 20th century and separated after Joseph Rutherford became president of the Watch Tower Society. Mary remained an active member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses until becoming confined to her home in the years before her death in 1962 at age 93.

Rutherford had reportedly lost the use of one lung from pneumonia suffered during his imprisonment in 1918 and 1919. Finding New York&#x27;s winter weather &quot;impossible&quot;, Rutherford was encouraged by a doctor to &quot;spend as much time as possible&quot; in a more favorable climate. In 1929, a residence named &quot;Beth Sarim&quot; (literally, &quot;House of Princes&quot;) was constructed at San Diego, California for Rutherford&#x27;s use, initially as winter accommodation and later as a full-time residence. He died at the property in 1942. The villa was sold in 1948, with &quot;The Watchtower&quot; declaring, &quot;It had fully served its purpose and was now only serving as a monument quite expensive to keep.&quot;

The standard of Rutherford&#x27;s accommodation and his personal conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society&#x27;s former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of &quot;luxurious&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot; residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), as well as two Cadillacs and alleged that on more than one occasion he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and &#x27;go from &quot;drink to drink&quot;&#x27;. 

In July 1939 Olin R. Moyle, legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing &quot;the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren.&quot; Moyle also accused Rutherford of &quot;unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language&quot; and condemned his allowing the &quot;glorification of alcohol&quot; at Bethel. Penton notes that Moyle was a &quot;teetotaller&quot; and &quot;puritanical&quot;, but claims Rutherford&#x27;s drinking habits were &quot;notorious&quot; and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.

==Death and burial==
From the age of 70, Rutherford underwent several medical treatments for cancer of the colon. This included an operation on November 5, 1941, which found &quot;carcinoma of the rectal sigmoid&quot;. Doctors gave him less than six months to live. Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942, at the age of 72. Cause of death was &quot;uraemia due to carcinoma of the rectum due to pelvic metastasis.&quot;

A Watch Tower Society staff member said of the announcement of Rutherford&#x27;s death, &quot;It was at noontime when the family was assembled for lunch. ... The announcement was brief. There were no speeches. No one took the day off to mourn. Rather, we went back to the factory and worked harder than ever.&quot;

Rutherford&#x27;s burial was delayed for five months due to legal proceedings arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. According to &quot;Consolation&quot;, &quot;Judge Rutherford looked for the early triumph of &#x27;the King of the East&#x27;, Christ Jesus, now leading the host of heaven, and he desired to be buried at dawn facing the rising sun, in an isolated part of the ground which would be administered by the princes, who should return from their graves.&quot; Based on his claims that resurrected biblical characters would live at Beth Sarim, Rutherford concluded that it was appropriate that his bones be buried on the property.

The legal problem arose because Beth Sarim was not a legally zoned cemetery. Witnesses collected more than 14,000 signatures for two petitions—one supporting his burial at Beth Sarim, another for a second preferred site on a nearby Watch Tower Society property named Beth-Shan—that Rutherford&#x27;s dying wish might be granted. &quot;Consolation&quot; condemned San Diego County officials for their refusal to grant a permit for Rutherford&#x27;s burial at either property, stating &quot;It was not the fate of the bones which they decided, but their own destiny. Nor is their blood on anyone else&#x27;s head, because they were told three times that to fight against God, or to tamper with His servant&#x27;s bones even, would bring upon them the condemnation of the Lord. ... So their responsibility is fixed, and they followed the course of Satan.&quot;

Speculation that Rutherford was secretly buried at Beth Sarim has been called &quot;private rumor&quot;, &#x27;frequently disproven&#x27;, and &quot;myth&quot;. The May 4, 1942, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine noted Rutherford&#x27;s burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road. In 2002, a caretaker at the immediately adjoining graveyard answered an inquiry about Watch Tower&#x27;s graveyard by noting, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell you who is buried on it because it has absolutely no markers or headstones&quot;.

Rutherford was succeeded by Nathan Homer Knorr as president of the Watch Tower Society.

<doc id="249140" wikidata="Q7378139" url="?curid=249140" title="Rugby, Tennessee">
<text>Rugby is an unincorporated community in Morgan and Scott counties in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Founded in 1880 by English author Thomas Hughes, Rugby was built as an experimental utopian colony. While Hughes&#x27;s experiment largely failed, a small community lingered at Rugby throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s, residents, friends and descendants of Rugby began restoring the original design and layout of the community, preserving surviving structures and reconstructing others. Rugby&#x27;s Victorian architecture and picturesque setting have since made it a popular tourist attraction. In 1972, Rugby&#x27;s historic area was listed under the name Rugby Colony on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

The Rugby experiment grew out of the social and economic conditions of Victorian England, where the practice of primogeniture and an economic depression had left many of the &quot;second sons&quot; of the English gentry jobless and idle. Hughes envisioned Rugby as a colony where England&#x27;s second sons would have a chance to own land and be free of social and moral ills that plagued late-19th-century English cities. The colony would reject late Victorian materialism in favor of the Christian socialist ideals of equality and cooperation espoused in Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;.

From the outset, however, the colony was beset with problems, namely a typhoid epidemic in 1881, lawsuits over land titles, and a population unaccustomed to the hard manual labor required to extract crops from the poor soil of the Cumberland Plateau. By late 1887, most of the original colonists had either died or moved away from Rugby. However, a few carried on into the 20th century and the village retained a small, continuous population.

==Geography==
Rugby is located atop the Cumberland Plateau near the junction of Morgan, Scott, and Fentress counties. While it straddles the two former counties, the majority of it lies in Morgan County. On the north side of Rugby, the Clear Fork joins White Oak Creek to form a natural pool known as &quot;The Meeting of the Waters&quot; that has been a popular hiking destination since the colony&#x27;s early days. Beyond Meeting-of-the-Waters, the Clear Fork continues northeastward for another to where it joins New River to form the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River.

State Route 52 passed through the town, until December 2013 when the &quot;Rugby Bypass&quot; opened, connecting it with U.S. Route 127 in Jamestown to the west and U.S. Route 27 in the community of Elgin to the east. The area is relatively remote, with the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area dominating the area to the north, and sparsely-populated rolling hills stretching for miles to the south. Most of the historic district is located on or near Tennessee state highway 52. A more modern residential area is located in the Beacon Hill section on the north side of the community.

==History==

===Establishment===

Thomas Hughes was born in Uffington, Oxfordshire, England in 1822. In the 1830s, he attended the Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, where he was greatly influenced by the school&#x27;s progressive headmaster, Thomas Arnold. Both Rugby School and Arnold figured prominently in Hughes&#x27;s 1857 novel, &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, and the school would eventually be the namesake for Hughes&#x27;s utopian colony in Tennessee. In &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;, Hughes espoused the ideals of Christian socialism, namely the cooperative ownership of community businesses. By the 1860s, Hughes had grown disenchanted with the materialism of late Victorian England. He was disheartened by the fact that the talents of many of England&#x27;s younger sons were wasted due to an economic recession and the medieval system of primogeniture, in which the oldest son inherited all of the family&#x27;s land.

In 1870, Hughes traveled to America to meet his friend, the poet James Russell Lowell, and learned of the Boston-based Board of Aid to Land Ownership, which specialized in helping unemployed urban craftsmen relocate to rural areas. Hughes indicated that such an operation might also be beneficial to young, unemployed English gentry. In 1878, Board of Aid president Franklin Webster Smith and an agent with the new Cincinnati Southern Railway, Cyrus Clarke, were travelling on the railroad&#x27;s new tracks along the Cumberland Plateau when they identified the future site of Rugby, and were impressed with its virgin forests, clear air, and scenic gorges. Clarke secured options on hundreds of thousands of acres of Plateau land. Knoxville attorney Oliver Perry Temple, who became the colony&#x27;s legal and agricultural advisor, began the complicated process of securing land titles.

Smith returned to Boston to recruit families to move to the newly acquired land on the Plateau, but economic conditions in the northeast had improved, and few families were interested in relocating. Smith then notified Hughes of the Board&#x27;s new land acquisitions, and Hughes expressed interest in establishing a colony. Hughes formed a partnership with British lawyers Sir Henry Kimber and John Boyle, and bought the Board of Aid.

===Rugby Colony, 1880–1887===
Franklin W. Smith, who was primarily responsible for Rugby&#x27;s early layout, chose the townsite for Rugby for its resort-like qualities, even though it was from the nearest railroad stop at Sedgemoor (modern-day Elgin, Tennessee). The colony&#x27;s first frame structure, known as the &quot;Asylum&quot; (now the Pioneer Cottage), was erected in early 1880, and the first wave of colonists constructed tennis and croquet courts, and built a walkway to &quot;The Meeting of the Waters.&quot; Within a few months, several residences had been completed, along with the three-story Tabard Inn, which was named for the Southwark hostelry in &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;.

Thomas Hughes was on hand for the colony&#x27;s &quot;opening&quot; on October 5, 1880, and gave a speech that laid out his plans for Rugby. All colonists would be required to invest $5 in the commissary, thus ensuring public ownership. Personal freedoms were guaranteed, although the sale of alcohol was banned. The colony would build an Episcopal church, but the building could be used by any denomination. On opening day, Tennessee&#x27;s Episcopal bishop, the Right Reverend Charles Quintard, chartered Christ Church and licensed colonist Joseph Blacklock as lay reader.

American publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and London publications such as &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and &quot;Punch&quot;, all followed the colony&#x27;s progress. Rugby published its own newspaper, &quot;The Rugbeian&quot;, which was edited by Oxford graduate Osmond Dakeyne, and several colonists formed a Library and Reading Room Society, headed by Tübingen graduate Edward Bertz, who was a long-term friend of the late nineteenth century English author George Gissing, with whom he corresponded over many years. In summer 1881, a typhoid outbreak killed seven colonists—including Dakeyne—and forced the Tabard Inn to close for cleansing, but the colony recovered. By 1884, the colony boasted over 400 residents, 65 frame public buildings and houses, a tennis team, a social club, and a literary and dramatic society. In 1885, Rugby established a university, Arnold School, named for Rugby School headmaster Thomas Arnold.

===Struggle and decline===
Throughout its early history, Rugby was beset with lawsuits over land titles. While Cyrus Clarke had obtained options on nearly of land, many of the Plateau&#x27;s Appalachian natives grew suspicious of Clarke and refused to sell their property. This slowed the colony&#x27;s early development, and as the lawsuits dragged on, many colonists gave up and moved away. Furthermore, Smith, who had selected the townsite, had ignored the site&#x27;s poor soil in favor of its potential as a mountain resort. Rugby&#x27;s main resort hotel, the Tabard, was forced to close due to the typhoid outbreak in 1881, and burned down altogether in 1884, halting Rugby&#x27;s burgeoning tourist economy and damaging the Board of Aid&#x27;s credit.

Frustrated by the colony&#x27;s slow development, the Board of Aid&#x27;s London backers replaced colony director John Boyle with Irish-born Cincinnati city engineer Robert Walton in May 1882. Rugby attempted to establish a tomato canning operation in 1883, but after the cannery was constructed, colonists failed to grow enough tomatoes to keep it operational. Newspapers began to ridicule Rugby, with London&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; accusing Hughes of creating a &quot;pleasure picnic&quot; rather than a functioning colony, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; claiming that Hughes was planning to abandon the colony altogether.

In 1887, the deaths of a number of prominent colonists—including Hughes&#x27;s mother, Margaret, and geologist Charles Wilson—led to the departure of most of Rugby&#x27;s original settlers. That year, Hughes made his last annual visit to the colony, and &quot;The Rugbeian&quot; ceased publication. In 1892, Sir Henry Kimber reorganized the Board of Aid as the Rugby Tennessee Company, which focused on harvesting the region&#x27;s natural resources, all but abandoning the anti-materialistic ideals on which the colony was founded. By 1900, the company had sold its Cumberland Plateau holdings.

===Preservation===
Robert Walton&#x27;s son, William (1887–1958), maintained the Thomas Hughes Library, the Christ Church Episcopal, and Kingstone Lisle until the mid-20th century. During the same period, Uffington House was maintained by the family of C.C. Brooks. Conservation efforts at Rugby began in the 1940s when logging practices were decimating the surrounding virgin forests. The efforts were publicized by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and gained federal support with the aide of Secretary of State Cordell Hull, but the state of Tennessee rejected the logging companies&#x27; offering price for the land, and the forest was cut right up to the community&#x27;s boundaries.

In 1966, preservationists formed Historic Rugby, a non-profit group dedicated to restoring and maintaining the community&#x27;s surviving historic structures, which include the Christ Church Episcopal, the Thomas Hughes Library, the Rugby School, Kingstone Lisle, Uffington House, and Newbury House. The group has also reconstructed several buildings based on their original designs, including the Board of Aid office, the Rugby Commissary, and Sir Henry Kimber&#x27;s Percy Cottage. The Harrow Road Cafe, a restaurant built in the 1980s, was named for a restaurant that existed at Rugby in the 1880s, although its original design is unknown. The Cafe was destroyed by fire on September 4, 2020. The Rugby Printing Works, which originally stood at nearby Deer Lodge, was moved to Rugby in the 1970s. Historic Rugby opened up the community&#x27;s Beacon Hill area (originally planned to include residences and a park) to new home construction, with the condition that all new homes must be designed in accordance with the community&#x27;s Victorian aesthetic.

==Notable buildings==
===Christ Church Episcopal===
The Christ Church Episcopal was established on October 5, 1880, and initially used the original Rugby schoolhouse for services. The current building was built in the Carpenter Gothic style in 1887 by Cornelius Onderdonk, who constructed many of the original buildings in Rugby, and consecrated by Episcopal bishop Charles Quintard in 1888. The church&#x27;s alms basin was designed by English carpenter Henry Fry, who had previously done work for various churches in the London area. The church&#x27;s reed organ, built in 1849, is one of the oldest in the United States. The Christ Church parish has met here regularly since 1887.

===Thomas Hughes Library===
Built in 1882, the Thomas Hughes Library is the most unchanged of all the buildings in Rugby. The library&#x27;s 7,000 volumes were collected primarily by Boston bookseller Estes &amp; Lauriat, and donated to Rugby&#x27;s Library and Reading Room Society with the stipulation they name the new library for Hughes. The library still contains most of its original collection, the oldest volume of which dates to 1687. German-born colonist Edward Bertz, Rugby&#x27;s first librarian, published a book about his Rugby experiences, entitled &quot;Das Sabinergut&quot;, in 1896.

===Kingstone Lisle===
Kingstone Lisle, a Queen Anne-style cottage, was built in 1884 as a residence for Thomas Hughes, although Hughes stayed at the cottage for just a very short period on one of his annual visits (he usually stayed at the Newbury House). In the late 1880s, Hughes gave the house to Christ Church priest Joseph Blacklock for use as a rectory. Historic Rugby restored the house in the 1960s, and has outfitted it with period furniture.

<doc id="249142" wikidata="Q1118509" url="?curid=249142" title="List of Royal Air Force stations">
<text>This list of Royal Air Force stations is an overview of all current stations of the Royal Air Force (RAF) throughout the United Kingdom and overseas. This includes front-line and training airbases, support, administrative and training stations with no flying activity, unmanned airfields used for training, intelligence gathering stations and an early warning radar network.

The list also includes RAF stations occupied by the United States Visiting Forces, former RAF stations now operated by defence contractor QinetiQ on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and air weapons ranges operated by the MOD.

Overseas, the RAF operates airfields at four Permanent Joint Operating Bases (PJOBs) which are located in British Overseas Territories.

==RAF stations and MOD airfields in the UK==
===Royal Air Force===

RAF front-line operations are centred on seven main operating bases (MOBs):
*RAF Coningsby, RAF Marham, and RAF Lossiemouth — Air Combat
*RAF Waddington — Combat Intelligence, Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance
*RAF Brize Norton — Air Transport
*RAF Benson and RAF Odiham — Support Helicopter Force, operating under Joint Aviation Command

Operations are supported by numerous other flying and non-flying stations, with activity centred at RAF Honington which coordinates Force Protection, and RAF Leeming and RAF Wittering which have a support enabler role.

Stations such as RAF Cranwell, RAF Valley and RAF Shawbury form part of the UK Military Flying Training System, which is dedicated to training aircrew for all three UK armed services. Specialist ground crew training takes place at RAF Cosford and MOD St Athan.

The Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) at RAF Boulmer is tasked with compiling a Recognised Air Picture of UK airspace and providing tactical control of the Quick Reaction Alert Force. Boulmer is supported by a network of seven Remote Radar Heads (RRHs) spread throughout the UK.

===Ministry of Defence===
Several former RAF stations are still owned by the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and are operated by defence contractor QinetiQ in the test and evaluation role. The main facility is MOD Boscombe Down in Wiltshire, which still has a significant RAF presence.

A small number of former RAF stations remain in MOD ownership even though they are used by the RAF in the relief landing ground (RLG) role, flying by Volunteer Gliding Squadrons or other training purposes. They are described as &quot;airfields&quot; and are typically unmanned.

===RAF stations===
=== Non-RAF stations used by the RAF ===
These are MOD or British Army facilities (most former RAF stations) listed in recognition of the RAF retaining a presence at each site.
=== Remote Radar Heads ===
Remote Radar Heads (RRHs) are the UK&#x27;s air defence radar sites. The RRHs can now be monitored centrally with only limited on-site radar maintenance support. This has enabled the release of the majority of RAF personnel previously based permanently at these locations. The sites are maintained and operated primarily by Serco. The MOD finished installing new state-of-the-art communications buildings, radar towers and bespoke perimeter security on the sites in 2023 under Programme HYDRA.
==RAF stations operated by the United States Visiting Forces==
At the invitation of the UK Government, the United States has had military forces (known as US Visiting Forces) permanently stationed in the United Kingdom since the Second World War. The 1951 NATO Status of Forces Agreement and the Visiting Forces Act 1952, along with other bilateral acts, establishes the legal status of the USVF in the UK. Several military sites within England are made available for the USVF&#x27;s purposes.

A Royal Air Force commander is present at the main USVF sites, and is normally of the rank of Squadron Leader, whereas a US Colonel will normally command US personnel at each station. The role of the RAF commander is to liaise with the US base commander, and act as head of establishment for Ministry of Defence employees. The use of UK bases for combat operations by the United States is a joint decision by both governments.

The United States Air Force (USAF) 501st Combat Support Wing manages and supports operations at RAF Alconbury, RAF Croughton, RAF Fairford, RAF Menwith Hill, RAF Molesworth, and RAF Welford, whereas RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall are managed by their respective host wings.
==MOD air weapons ranges==
Air weapons ranges (AWR) within the United Kingdom, previously operated by the Royal Air Force, are the responsibility of the Service Delivery (SD) part of the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO). QinetiQ were awarded a three-year contract by the DIO in 2010 to manage the ranges, but this role was taken over by Landmarc Support Services (part of Interserve) in 2014 as part of a contract covering the wider MOD Defence Training Estate.

==RAF stations and locations overseas==
===Permanent Joint Operating Bases===
The United Kingdom operates Permanent Joint Operating Bases (PJOBs) in four British Overseas Territories, namely Ascension Island, the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar. 

The Falklands Islands also have three Remote Radar Heads, forming part of an early warning and airspace control network.

The PJOBs contribute to the physical defence and maintenance of sovereignty of these British Overseas Territories and enable the UK to conduct expeditionary military operations.

<text>Wang Ko (; Mongolian name: Öljeyitü (完澤禿); d. 1345), known by his Korean Royal title as Prince Yeonan () and served in Yuan as King Shen of Yang (), was a Goryeo Royal Family member as the son of Duke Gangyang and grandson of King Chungnyeol who became a nobleman in Yuan Dynasty and a potential competitor to King Chungseon (his half uncle) and King Chungsuk which favored him.

==Biography==
In 1314 when King Chungseon passed the throne to his son Ratnashri (King Chungsuk), Öljeyitü was installed as Crown Prince and sent to the Yuan court as a hostage by rule. However, when King Chungsuk fathered Buddhashri (King Chunghye), Öljeyitü forced to abdicate from crown prince, but King Chungseon transferred his post of King of Shen to him instead. The title of King of Shen was originally given to King Chungseon by Khayishan (Külüg Khan) after his support of Khayisan&#x27;s succession in 1307. Öljeyitü married with a daughter of Sungshan (松山 songshan), King of Liang (粱王) of the imperial family.

When Sidibala (Gegeen Khan) ascended to the throne in 1320, Öljeyitü began a campaign to become the King of Goryeo. By his scheme, the Khan banished Chungseon to Tibet in 1320 and interned King Chungsuk in 1321. However, Sidibala was assassinated in 1323 and Öljeitü&#x27;s plan was aborted.

King Chungsuk, who was allowed to return to Goryeo in 1325, passed the throne to Buddhashri in 1330 but was reinstated after two years because Buddhashri was deposed by Yuan. In 1333 Öljeyitü reached a settlement with Ratnashri and returned to Goryeo.

When King Chungsuk died in 1339, Öljeyitü try to wrest the crown again but was crushed by King Chunghye. However Bayan, who seized real power, hated Chunghye because he had friendly relations with El Temür, whose faction was purged by Bayan. Bayan imprisoned Chunghye in 1340. Immediately after that, Bayan was banished by his nephew and Öljeyitü&#x27;s plot was stopped again.

King Chunghye was arrested in 1343 and died while being transported to Guangdong. Wang Ko acted as a king for a while. Padma Dorji (King Chungmok), Chunghye&#x27;s little son, ascended to the throne after the death of Chunghye. Öljeyitü returned to Goryeo but died the next year.

In 1354 Öljeyitü&#x27;s grandson Toghtua Bukha (脫脫不花) was installed as King of Shen. In 1356 Öljei Khutugh Khatun wanted him to become King of Goryeo but he refused the offer. When King Gongmin died in 1374, the Yuan Dynasty in Mongolia tried to appoint him again and a faction in Goryeo welcomed the plan, but it was eventually failed.

<doc id="249152" wikidata="Q171399" url="?curid=249152" title="Fuji Speedway">
<text>is a motorsport race track standing in the foothills of Mount Fuji, in Oyama, Suntō District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. It was built in the early 1960s. In the 1980s, Fuji Speedway was used for the FIA World Sportscar Championship and national racing. Originally managed by Mitsubishi Estate, Fuji Speedway was acquired by Toyota in 2000. The circuit hosted the Formula One 2007 Japanese Grand Prix after an absence of nearly 30 years, replacing the Suzuka Circuit owned by Honda. After Fuji Speedway hosted the 2008 race, the Japanese Grand Prix returned to Suzuka for races from 2009 onward. The Super GT Fuji 500 km race is held at the racetrack on Golden Week.

Fuji Speedway has one of the longest straights in motorsport, at in length. The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.

==History==

=== 1963–79: F1 launches in Japan ===
Fuji Speedway Corporation was established in 1963 as Japan NASCAR Corporation. At first, the circuit was planned to hold NASCAR-style races in Japan. Therefore, the track was originally designed to be a banked superspeedway, but there was not enough money to complete the project and only one of the bankings was completed. Mitsubishi Estate invested in the circuit and took over the reins of management in October 1965.

Converted to a road course, the circuit opened in December 1965 and proved to be somewhat dangerous, with the wide banked turn (named &quot;Daiichi&quot;) regularly resulting in major accidents. Vic Elford said:

After a fatal accident in 1974 on the Daiichi banking where drivers Hiroshi Kazato and Seiichi Suzuki were both killed in a fiery accident that injured 6 other people, a new part of track was built to counteract the problem, and the resultant course, which also eliminated 5 other fast corners, proved more successful. In 1966, the track hosted a USAC Indy Car non-championship race, won by Jackie Stewart. The track had a 24-hour race in 1967.

The speedway brought the first Formula One race to Japan at the end of the 1976 season. The race had a dramatic World Championship battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and in rainy conditions, Hunt earned enough points to win the title. Mario Andretti won the race, with Lauda withdrawing due to the dangerous conditions.

In 1977, Gilles Villeneuve was involved in a crash that killed two spectators on the side of the track, leading to Formula One leaving the speedway. When Japan earned another race on the F1 schedule ten years later, it went to Suzuka instead. The Grand Prix returned to Fuji in 2007 following its renovation.

===1980–2000: National racing venue===

Fuji remained a popular sports car racing venue; the FIA World Sportscar Championship visited the track between 1982 and 1988 and it was often used for national races. Speeds continued to be very high, and two chicanes were added to the track: one after the first hairpin corner, the second at the entry to the wide, fast final turn (300R). Even with these changes, the main feature of the track remained its approximately long straight, one of the longest in all of motorsports.

The long pit straight has also been utilised for drag racing. NHRA exhibitions were run in 1989, and in 1993 Shirley Muldowney ran a 5.30 on the quarter-mile strip at Fuji. Local drag races are common on the circuit, at both &amp; distances.

The track continued to be used for Japanese national races. Plans to host a CART event in 1991 were abandoned due to conflicts with the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile. It was not until the autumn of 2000 that the majority of the stocks of the track were bought by Toyota from Mitsubishi Estate as part of its motor racing plans for the future.

On May 3, 1998, there was a multi-car crash during a parade lap before a JGTC race caused by the safety car slowing in torrential rain. Ferrari driver Tetsuya Ota suffered serious burns over his entire body after being trapped in his car for almost 90 seconds, and Porsche driver Tomohiko Sunako fractured his right leg.

===2001–present: renovations===
In 2003, the circuit was closed down to accommodate a major reprofiling of the track, using a new design from Hermann Tilke. The track was reopened on April 10, 2005, and hosted its first Formula One championship event in 29 years on September 30, 2007. In circumstances similar to Fuji&#x27;s first Grand Prix in 1976, the race was run in heavy rain and mist and the first 19 laps were run under the safety car, in a race won by Lewis Hamilton.
The circuit has hosted the Nismo Festival for historic Nissan racers since refurbishment in 2003; the event previously took place at Okayama. When the festival returned in 2005, the organisers allowed circuit owner Toyota to bring in its Toyota 7 Can-Am racer to re-enact an old Japanese GP battle. Toyota also hosts its own historic event a week before the Nismo festival called the Toyota Motorsports Festival. Close to the circuit is a drifting course, which was built as part of the refurbishment under the supervision of &quot;Drift King&quot; Keiichi Tsuchiya and former works driver and Super GT team manager Masanori Sekiya. There is a Toyota Safety Education Center and a mini circuit. In addition to motorsports, Fuji also hosts the Udo Music Festival.

The only time the circuit is run on a reverse direction is during the D1 Grand Prix round, as Keiichi Tsuchiya felt the new layout meant reduced entry speed, making it less suitable for drifting. The series has hosted its rounds since ; with the exception of the 2004 closure, the circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit. The drift course starts from the 300R section and ends past the Coca-Cola corner. With the reprofiling, as cars no longer run downbank, entry speeds have since been reduced, the hill at the exit making acceleration difficult. As part of the 2003 renovations, most of the old banked section of track was demolished. Only a small section remains to this day.

Fuji Speedway was announced to host the finish of the road cycling races at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics.

===2007 and 2008 Japanese Grands Prix===
During the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, Fuji Speedway met with a lot of problems, including the paralysis of the transportation network provided by the shuttle buses, poor facilities including some reserved seats without a view, lack of organization, and expensive meals such as simple lunch boxes being sold for 10,000 yen (US$87) at the circuit.

Newspaper accounts of the event also alleged problems with Toyota bias and control. The circuit prohibited spectators from setting up flags and banners to support teams and drivers, with the exception of the Toyota F1 team. Therefore, there were very few flags and banners in the event compared with other Grand Prix events.

For the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix race, organizers responded to lessons learned the previous year by reducing the total number of spectators allowed at the event. Compared to 140,000 persons allowed for Sunday events in 2007, attendance was restricted to 110,000. Additionally, walkways and spectator facilities were improved, along with larger screens. However, the race was also affected by rainy weather, which has historically interfered in a number of past races at the circuit, and later in 2013, led to interference with a 6-hour endurance race at the track for the FIA World Endurance Championship.

Following both poor ticket sales and weather, it was decided by FOM that the FIA Japanese Grand Prix would be shared between Fuji and Suzuka on alternate years, with Suzuka holding the next race on Sunday, October 4, 2009. After the Great Recession and its own operational deficit, Toyota discontinued the hosting of Japanese Grand Prix beginning in 2010.

===2020 Summer Olympics===
During the 2020 Summer Olympics, which due to the COVID-19 pandemic were postponed to 2021, the speedway was a venue and finish for the cycling races:
* Men&#x27;s individual road race: on 24 July 2021 won the gold medal, silver and bronze.
* Women&#x27;s individual road race: on 25 July 2021 won the gold medal, silver and bronze.
* Women&#x27;s road time trial: on 28 July 2021 won the gold medal, won silver and won bronze.
* Men&#x27;s road time trial: on 28 July 2021 won the gold medal, silver and bronze.

=== 2022: Fuji Motorsports Forest ===
In April 2022, Toyota announced the construction of the &quot;Fuji Motorsports Forest&quot;, which , a real-estate company of Toyota Group, was pushing forward as the &quot;Motorsports Village&quot; project until then. The project precedes the completion of the Shin-Tōmei Expressway and smart interchange near the circuit.

With the regional redevelopment plan centered on Fuji Speedway, the Fuji Speedway Hotel (operated by Hyatt) including the Fuji Motorsports Museum was built on the west side of the circuit and opened in October 2022.

==Layout history==

==Race lap records==

As of May 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Fuji Speedway are listed as:

==Corners==
This is the official listing of the twelve corners that make up the current circuit layout, in use since 2005. Only some corners have Japanese names, most of which are a result of sponsorship agreements. The rest are named after the radius of the corner in metres.
#TGR Corner (27R)
#75R
#Coca-Cola Corner (80R)
#Toyopet (100R)
#Advan Corner (30R)
#120R
#300R
#Dunlop Corner (15R)
#30R
#45R
#GR Supra Corner (25R)
#Panasonic Corner (12R)

The Dunlop corner differs with the configuration used. In the full configuration, it consists of a tight right hairpin turn followed by a left-right flick. In the GT course, it is a medium-speed right-hander, bypassing turns 11 and 12.

<text>Laura Secord (; 13 September 1775 – 17 October 1868) was a Canadian woman involved in the War of 1812. She is known for having walked out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack. Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada. Though Laura Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the Laura Secord Chocolates company, named after her on the centennial of her walk.

Laura Secord&#x27;s father, Thomas Ingersoll, lived in Massachusetts and fought on the side of the Patriots during the Revolutionary War (1775–1783). In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of Upper Canada after he had applied for and received a land grant. Shortly after, Laura married Loyalist James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights early in the War of 1812. While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the Niagara Peninsula, including Queenston. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant James FitzGibbon in the territory still controlled by the British. The information helped the British and their Mohawk allies repel the invading Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams. Her effort was forgotten until 1860, when Edward, Prince of Wales, awarded the impoverished widow £100 (£12,955.64 in 2022) for her service on his visit to Canada.

The story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada. Her tale has been the subject of books, plays, and poetry, often with many embellishments. Since her death, Canada has bestowed honours on her, including schools named after her, monuments, a museum, a memorial stamp and coin, and a statue at the Valiants Memorial in the Canadian capital.

==Personal history==

===Family history and early life===

Laura&#x27;s father, Thomas Ingersoll, married seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Dewey on 28 February 1775 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. Their first child, Laura, was born there on 13 September 1775. Thomas, son of Jonathan Ingersoll, was born in 1749 in Westfield, Massachusetts. Elizabeth, daughter of Israel Dewey, was also born in Westfield. Thomas moved to Great Barrington in 1774, where he settled into a house on a small piece of land by the Housatonic River. Over the next several years, his success as a hatter allowed him to marry, increase his landholdings, and enlarge his house as his family grew. During the American Revolutionary War, Thomas spent much time away from home as a militia officer serving on the Patriot side. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Massachusetts militia in October 1777 and rose to the rank of captain. When the war was over, Thomas was appointed a magistrate upon his return to Great Barrington. Thomas helped suppress Shays&#x27; Rebellion in 1786, which earned him the rank of major.

Elizabeth gave birth to three more girls: Elizabeth Franks on 17 October 1779; Mira (or Myra) in 1781; and Abigail in September 1783. Elizabeth Ingersoll died on 20 February 1784, and Abigail was given up for adoption to Elizabeth&#x27;s sister Abigail and her husband Daniel Nash. Thomas remarried on 26 May 1785 to Mercy Smith, widow of Josiah Smith. Although Mercy was childless, she has been credited with teaching her stepdaughters to read and do needlework before her death from tuberculosis in 1789.

Thomas remarried four months after Mercy&#x27;s death, on 20 September 1789, to Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Backus (née Whiting), a widow with a daughter, Nancy. The couple had an additional four girls and three boys. The first boy, Charles Fortescue, was born on 27 September 1791. Charlotte (born 1793) and Appolonia &quot;Appy&quot; (born 1794) were the last members of this branch of the Ingersoll family to be born in Massachusetts.

In the years after the Revolutionary War, Laura&#x27;s father witnessed and was offended by the continuing persecution of Loyalists in Massachusetts. Thomas realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the war, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again. In 1793, Thomas met in New York City with Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, who offered to show him the best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the British Crown was encouraging development. He and four associates travelled to Upper Canada and petitioned Lieutenant Governor John Simcoe for a land grant. They received in the Thames River valley, and founded Oxford-on-the-Thames (later known as Ingersoll, Ontario), on condition that they populate it with forty other families within seven years. After winding up his affairs in Great Barrington, Thomas and his family moved to Upper Canada in 1795.

===Upper Canada, marriage and children===

Thomas Ingersoll supported his family in their early years in Upper Canada by running a tavern in Queenston while land was being cleared and roads built in the settlement. The family stayed in Queenston until a log cabin was completed on the settlement in 1796. After Governor Simcoe returned to England in 1796, opposition grew in Upper Canada to the &quot;Late Loyalists&quot;, such as Thomas, who had come to Canada for the land grants. The grants were greatly reduced, and Thomas&#x27;s contract was cancelled for not having all of its conditions fulfilled. Feeling cheated, in 1805 he moved the family to Credit River, close to York (present-day Toronto), where he successfully ran an inn until his 1812 death following a stroke. Sally continued to run it until her own death in 1833.

Laura Ingersoll remained in Queenston when the family moved. She married merchant James Secord, likely in June 1797. James was the son of James Secord, a Loyalist who had served as a Lieutenant in the British Indian Department during the Revolutionary War. The couple lived in a house built in , the first floor of which was a shop. Secord gave birth to her first child, Mary, in St. in 1799. Mary was followed by Charlotte (1801), Harriet (10 February 1803), Charles Badeau (1809 – the only male child) and Appolonia (1810).

===Battle of Queenston Heights===

When the United States declared war against Britain in June 1812, James enlisted in the 1st Lincoln Regiment of Militia as a sergeant. He had previously been a captain in the 1st Lincoln but had resigned his commission before 1812. James was attached to Issac Swayze&#x27;s troop of Provincial Royal Artillery Drivers, also known as the &quot;Car Brigade.&quot; This militia unit was responsible for moving field guns and ammunition during military engagements.

On October 13, 1812, the Americans crossed the Niagara River and landed near Queenston. Laura and her five children took shelter in a farmhouse about a mile inland, while James mustered with the militia. During the ensuing Battle of Queenston Heights, James was shot twice, once in the shoulder and once in the knee. When the guns fell silent, Laura returned to the village to discover that American soldiers had ransacked her house. She received word that James had been wounded and headed for the battlefield. With &quot;the assistance of a gentleman&quot; Laura brought James to their home and treated his injuries. Once James was well enough to be moved, Laura took her husband and children to St. Davids where they spent the winter living with James&#x27;s relatives.

An early biographer of Laura Secord, Emma A. Currie, related a story, attributed to James and Laura&#x27;s grandson, that Laura encountered three American soldiers intending to club her wounded husband to death with their muskets. An American officer, Captain John E. Wool, intervened, sent the three back across the river under guard, and ordered his men to carry James to his house in Queenston. This story has been dismissed by later biographers as the Americans had surrendered well before Laura arrived on the battlefield, while Captain Wool had been ordered back across the river hours earlier to have his wounds treated.

===Secord&#x27;s walk===

On 27 May 1813, the American army launched an attack across the Niagara River, and captured Fort George. Queenston and the Niagara area fell to the Americans. Men of military age were sent as prisoners to the U.S., though the still-recuperating James Secord was not among them. That June, a number of U.S. soldiers were billeted at the Secords&#x27; home.

On the evening of 21 June 1813, Laura Secord heard of plans for a surprise American attack on Lieutenant James FitzGibbon&#x27;s British troops at Beaver Dams, which would have furthered American control in the Niagara Peninsula. It is unclear how she became aware of these plans. According to tradition she overheard a conversation among the billeted Americans as they ate dinner.

As her husband was still recovering from his October injuries, Secord set out early the next morning to warn the lieutenant. She reportedly walked from present-day Queenston through St. , Homer, Shipman&#x27;s Corners and Short Hills at the Niagara Escarpment before she arrived at the camp of allied Mohawk warriors, who led her the rest of the way to FitzGibbon&#x27;s headquarters at the DeCew House. Based on her warning, a small British force and a larger contingent of Mohawk warriors were readied for the American attack. They defeated the Americans, most of whom were casualties or taken prisoner in the Battle of Beaver Dams on 24 June. No mention of Secord was made in reports that immediately followed the battle.

===Post-war years===

After the war, with the Secords&#x27; Queenston store in ruins, the family was impoverished. Only James&#x27;s small war pension and the rent from 200 acres (81 ha) of land they had in Grantham Township supported them.

The Secords&#x27; sixth child, Laura Anne, was born in October 1815, and their last child, Hannah, was born in 1817. The Secords&#x27; eldest daughter Mary wedded a doctor, William Trumball, on 18 April 1816. On 27 March 1817, Mary gave birth in Ireland to Elizabeth Trumball, the first of Laura and James&#x27;s grandchildren. Mary had another daughter, also named Mary, in Jamaica. Following her husband&#x27;s death, Mary returned to Queenston with her children in 1821.

The struggling James petitioned the government in 1827 for some sort of employment. Lieutenant-Governor Peregrine Maitland did not offer him a position, but offered something to Laura. He asked her to be in charge of the yet-to-be-completed Brock&#x27;s Monument. At first, she turned it down, but then reluctantly accepted it. When Brock&#x27;s Monument opened in 1831, Secord learned the new Lieutenant-Governor, John Colborne, intended to give the keys to the widow of a member of the monument committee who had died in an accident. On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland&#x27;s promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war. She wrote that Colonel Thomas Clarke had been told by Maitland, &quot;it was too late to think of [the committee member&#x27;s widow] Mrs. Nichol as I have pledged my word to Mrs. Secord that as soon as possible she should have the key.&quot; Despite her pleas, Secord did not receive the keys to the monument.

In 1828, the Secords&#x27; daughter, Appolonia, died at 18 of typhus, and James was appointed registrar of the Niagara Surrogate Court. He was promoted to judge in 1833, and his son Charles Badeau Secord took over the registrar position. Charles Badeau Secord&#x27;s first son, Charles Forsyth Secord, was born 9 May 1833. His is the only line of Secords that survived into the 21st century.

James became a customs collector in 1835 at the port of Chippawa. The position came with a home in Chippawa, into which the family moved. Charles Badeau Secord took over the Queenston home. Daughter Laura Ann and her son moved into the home in 1837 following her husband&#x27;s death.

===Later life and death===

James Secord died of a stroke on 22 February 1841. He was buried, according to his wishes, at Drummond Hill (now in Niagara Falls). James&#x27;s death left Laura destitute. When his war pension ended, she was unable to maintain her land as profitable and sold off much of it. Governor-General Sydenham denied a 27 February 1841 petition which she sent, seeking to have her son to take over James&#x27;s customs position. Sydenham also denied a petition she sent that May for a pension for herself, as James had received a pension for decades.

Possibly with help from better-off members of the family, Secord moved to a red brick cottage on Water Street in November 1841. Daughter Harriet and her own two daughters joined her in May 1842, after Harriet&#x27;s husband died of alcohol poisoning. The three shared quarters with Secord for the rest of her life. Youngest daughter Hannah also moved in when she was widowed in 1844, and brought two daughters with her. Though she lacked training, for a short time Laura Secord ran a small school out of the home in an effort to support herself. This venture came to an end when the public common school system was introduced in the 1840s.

Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully petitioned the government for some kind of acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the Prince of Wales heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned of Laura Secord&#x27;s plight as an aging widow and sent an award of £100 (). It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.

Laura Secord died in 1868 at the age of 93. She was interred next to her husband in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls. Her grave is marked by a monument with a bust on top, and is close to a monument marking the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane.

The inscription on her grave marker reads:

==Memory and legend==

Her granddaughter described Secord as being with brown eyes and a fair complexion. James FitzGibbon wrote she was &quot;of slight frame and delicate appearance&quot;. She was skilled at needlework, dressmaking and cooking. According to biographer Peggy Dymond Leavey, her many grandchildren enjoyed hearing their grandmother tell stories of her early life, and her Anglican faith increased with age.

In his report of the battle, FitzGibbon stated only that he &quot;received information&quot; about the threat; it is possible he omitted mention of Secord to protect her family during wartime. He first wrote of Secord in a certificate dated 26 February 1820, in support of a petition by her husband for a licence to operate a stone quarry in Queenston. In 1827 FitzGibbon wrote:

FitzGibbon wrote in a certificate dated 23 February 1837 that Secord did &quot;acquaint&quot; him with the Americans&#x27; intentions, but does not state whether he used the information. A diary entry of Mohawk chief John Norton talks of &quot;a loyal Inhabitant brought information that the Enemy intended to attack&quot;, but does not name the &quot;Inhabitant&quot;. Dominique Ducharme, leader of the Caughnawaga Mohawk in the Battle of Beaver Dams, made no mention of Secord in his reports, nor of receiving information from either Secord or FitzGibbon about the impending American attack.

Secord wrote two accounts of her walk, the first in 1853, and the second in 1861. Neither account contains details that can be corroborated with military accounts of the battle, such as specific dates or details about troops. Her account changed throughout her life. Historian Pierre Berton noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack. She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord&#x27;s informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with treason had Secord revealed her source. In the 1860s, as Secord&#x27;s story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.

A number of historians have questioned Secord&#x27;s account. W. Stewart Wallace, in his 1932 book, &quot;The Story of Laura Secord: A Study in Historical Evidence&quot;, concluded her story was mostly myth, and that she played no significant role in the outcome of the Battle of Beaver Dams. Historian George Ingram contended in his 1965 book &quot;The Story of Laura Secord Revisited&quot; that Secord&#x27;s debunking had been taken too far. Ruth MacKenzie also burnished Secord&#x27;s reputation with &quot;Laura Secord: The Legend and the Lady&quot; in 1971.

The question of Secord&#x27;s actual contribution to the British success has been contested. In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on 23 June. Historian Ernest Cruikshank wrote in 1895 that &quot;Scarcely had Mrs Secord concluded her narrative, when [Ducharme&#x27;s] scouts came in ... they had encountered the advance guard of the enemy.&quot; Later, two testimonials were found which FitzGibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827, which supported Secord&#x27;s claim. FitzGibbon asserted that Laura Secord had arrived on 22 June (not 23 June), and that &quot;in consequence of this information&quot;, he had been able to intercept the American troops.

==Legacy==

According to legend, &quot;it took her approximately 17 hours to travel the distance to warn Lieutenant James FitzGibbon of the impending American attack&quot;.

She has often been depicted as &quot;a lone figure bravely travelling through approximately 30 km of wilderness from her home at Queenston to a British military detachment camped in DeCew House in what is today Thorold, Ontario.&quot;

Historian Cecilia Morgan argues that the Secord story became famous in the 1880s when upper-class women sought to strengthen the emotional ties between Canadian women and the British Empire. She writes that they needed a female heroine to validate their claims for women&#x27;s suffrage. The first product of their campaign was Sarah Anne Curzon&#x27;s verse drama &quot;Laura Secord: The Heroine of 1812&quot; in 1887. The play was a catalyst for &quot;a deluge of articles and entries on Secord that filled Canadian histories and school textbooks at the turn of the 20th century&quot;. Although critics gave the play negative reviews, it was the first full work devoted to Secord&#x27;s story and popularized her image.

Secord has been compared to French-Canadian heroine Madeleine de Verchères and to American Revolution hero Paul Revere. Her story has been retold and commemorated by generations of biographers, playwrights, poets, novelists and journalists.

After discovering a newspaper clipping of the events, early feminist Emma Currie began a lifelong interest in Secord&#x27;s life. She tracked down information from Laura&#x27;s relatives as far away as Great Barrington, and published a biographical account in 1900 called &quot;The Story of Laura Secord&quot;. She later successfully petitioned to have a Secord memorial erected in Queenston Heights. The cut stone granite monument stands and was dedicated in 1901. In 1905, Secord&#x27;s portrait was hung in Parliament. Playwright Merrill Denison wrote a radio play of her story in 1931 which mixed serious history with parody.

On the centennial of Secord&#x27;s walk in 1913, and to capitalize on Canadian patriotic feelings, Frank O&#x27;Connor founded Laura Secord Chocolates. The chain&#x27;s first location opened on Yonge and Elm streets in Toronto. The chocolates were packaged in black boxes adorned with a cameo of Secord. By the 1970s, the company had become the largest candy retailer in Canada. Among most Canadians, the name Laura Secord is more strongly associated with the chocolate company than with the historical figure.

During the War of 1812, the Secords&#x27; Queenston homestead was fired upon and looted. It was restored in the late 20th century and given to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1971. It is now operated as a museum and gift shop at Partition and Queen streets in Queenston. The Laura Secord Legacy Trail covers the 32 kilometer route of the journey she undertook from her homestead in Queenston to DeCew House in Thorold where she delivered her message to Lt. FitzGibbon on 22 June 1813.

Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s old home on Main Street in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Laura Secord&#x27;s birthplace, was used as the town&#x27;s Free Library from 1896 until 1913. The Mason Library replaced it and was built on the site. The Great Barrington Historic District Commission made 18 October 1997 Laura Secord Day, and dedicated a plaque in her honour at the site of the Mason Library.

Laura Secord is the namesake of a number of schools, including Laura Secord Public School (also known as Laura Secord Memorial School, 1914–2010) in Queenston, École Laura Secord School in Winnipeg, Manitoba (built 1912), Laura Secord Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario and Laura Secord Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia. Beaver Dams Battlefield Park has a plaque dedicated to Secord. In 1992, Canada Post issued a Laura Secord commemorative stamp. In 2003, the Minister of Canadian Heritage declared Secord a &quot;Person of National Historical Significance&quot;, and in 2006 Secord&#x27;s was one of fourteen statues dedicated at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of her walk, Secord&#x27;s image adorned a circulation quarter issued by the Royal Canadian Mint and a postage stamp from Canada Post.

<text>A cenotaph is an empty tomb or a monument erected in honor of a person or group of people whose remains are elsewhere or have been lost. It can also be the initial tomb for a person who has since been reinterred elsewhere. Although the majority of cenotaphs honor individuals, many noted cenotaphs are also dedicated to the memories of groups of individuals, such as the lost soldiers of a country or of an empire.

==Etymology==
&quot;Cenotaph&quot; means &quot;empty tomb&quot; and is derived from the Greek , a compound word that is created from the morphological combination of two root words: 
# meaning &quot;empty&quot;
# meaning &quot;tomb&quot;, from 

==History==
Cenotaphs were common in the ancient world. Many were built in Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece and across Northern Europe (in the shape of Neolithic barrows).

The cenotaph in Whitehall, London, designed in 1919 by Sir Edwin Lutyens, influenced the design of many other war memorials in Britain and in the British sectors of the Western Front, as well as those in other Commonwealth nations. Lutyens&#x27; cenotaph was chosen as a deliberately secular monument. 

The Church of Santa Engrácia, in Lisbon, Portugal, turned into a National Pantheon in 1966, holds six cenotaphs, namely to Luís de Camões, Pedro Álvares Cabral, Afonso de Albuquerque, Nuno Álvares Pereira, Vasco da Gama and Henry the Navigator.

The Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Italy, contains a number of cenotaphs, including one for Dante Alighieri, who is buried in Ravenna.

==Regional==

===Africa===
====South Africa====
Durban has a striking and unusual cenotaph made of granite and lavishly decorated with brightly coloured ceramics.

Gqeberha (its former name Port Elizabeth) has a cenotaph. Located on the edge of St George&#x27;s Park in Rink Street, it was designed by Elizabeth Gardner to commemorate the men who died in the First World War (1914–1918) and was erected by the monumental mason firm of Pennachini Bros. On either side of the central sarcophagus are statues by Technical College Art School principal, James Gardner, who served in the trenches during the war. One depicts St George and the Dragon, the other depicts the sanctity of family life. Surrounding the sarcophagus are a number of bas-relief panels depicting scenes and people during the First World War. It was unveiled by Mrs W F Savage and dedicated by Canon Mayo on 10 November 1929. A surrounding memorial wall commemorates the men and women killed during World War II.

====Zambia====

===The Americas===
====Argentina====
A monument which has come to be known to as the &quot;Cenotaph&quot; was erected in Plaza San Martín, in downtown Buenos Aires, to commemorate the Argentinian soldiers who died during the Falklands War, in 1982. The monument consists of a series of plaques of black marble with the names of the fallen, surrounding a flame, and during the day is guarded by two soldiers.

Another cenotaph, which is a replica of the Argentine Military Cemetery in Darwin on the Falkland Islands, exists in Campo de Mayo, a large Army facility and training field just outside Buenos Aires.

====Bermuda====
A limestone replica of the Cenotaph at Whitehall in London was erected outside the Cabinet Building in Hamilton, Bermuda (with the cornerstone laid in 1920, and the completed monument unveiled in 1925).

====Falkland Islands====

In the Falkland Islands, there are several war memorials to commemorate those killed in the Falklands War in 1982. The main memorial for Falkland Islanders is the 1982 Liberation Memorial, a cenotaph erected in Stanley in 1984 which lists all the British Army regiments, RAF squadrons, Royal Navy vessels and the Royal Marine formations and units that took part in the conflict. The names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war are listed on ten plaques behind the Memorial, divided into the service branches.

Services are held at the Memorial each year on 14 June (Liberation Day) and on Remembrance Sunday, with wreaths being laid at the foot of the Memorial.

====United States====

It has an Egyptian Revival cenotaph base, surmounted by a fasces bound together with ribbons bearing the names of the dead. It was designed by French émigré architect Maximilian Godefroy in 1815, and construction was completed in 1827. It is considered the first war memorial in America, and an early example of a memorial to individual soldiers. The Monument appears on the Seal and the Logo of the City of Baltimore, and serves as a symbol for any agencies of the municipal government.

A cenotaph for the defenders of the Battle of the Alamo (March 1836) stands in front of the Alamo mission chapel in San Antonio, Texas. The cenotaph is empty because the remains of the fallen were cremated.

===Europe===
====Belgium====

The Interallied Memorial of Cointe, commissioned by FIDAC (The Interallied Federation of War Veterans Organisations) and built after World War I in Liège, is a complex consisting of a cenotaph with a tower as a secular monument and the Sacré-Cœur church as a religious building. Numerous monuments donated by Allied nations are displayed in the tower and on the adjoining esplanade.

====France====

In the Museum of Aquitaine, in Bordeaux, is the cenotaph of Michel de Montaigne, a French Renaissance writer and philosopher. The tomb was sculpted in 1593, a year after his death on the request of his wife, Françoise de la Chassaigne, probably by Prieur and Guillerman, two Bordeaux ornamentists.

On the cenotaph, next to the coat of arms, there are two epitaphs, in Greek and in Latin. The one in Latin begins: &quot;To Michel de Montaigne, son of Pierre, grandson of Grimond, great-grand-son of Raymond, knight of Saint-Michel, ex-mayor of the city of Bordeaux, a man born for glory, with gentle manners, a witty mind ...&quot;.

====United Kingdom====

=====London=====

A cenotaph in the UK that stands in Whitehall, London, was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and replaced Lutyens&#x27; identical wood-and-plaster cenotaph erected in 1919 for the Allied Victory Parade, and is a Grade I listed building. It is undecorated save for a carved wreath on each end and the words &quot;The Glorious Dead&quot;, chosen by Lloyd George. It was intended to commemorate specifically the victims of the First World War, but is used to commemorate all of the dead in all wars in which British servicemen and women have fought. The dates of the First World War and the Second World War are inscribed on it in Roman numerals. The design was used in the construction of many other war memorials throughout the British Empire. The Cenotaph is used for annual Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday Commemorations held every November where all political leaders and ex-prime ministers attend and lay a wreath in dedication to the fallen.

=====Belfast=====

The Cenotaph in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is located in the grounds of Belfast City Hall and is set within a Garden of Remembrance. It is about high and presents several carvings including laurel wreaths, symbolising victory and honour. The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Northern Ireland memorial held on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November (Armistice Day).

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, Anzac Day commemorations are usually held at all of the nation&#x27;s many war memorials, but not all of them are cenotaphs. Cenotaphs include the Hobart Cenotaph, the Sydney Cenotaph and the obelisk within the State War Memorial in Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia.

====New Zealand====
Anzac Day commemorations in New Zealand are also usually held at local war memorials. Cenotaphs include the Dunedin Cenotaph, the Wellington Cenotaph and the Auckland War Memorial Museum Cenotaph (a copy of the Whitehall Cenotaph).

==Cenotaphs for the missing==
Although most notable cenotaphs commemorate notable individuals buried elsewhere, many cenotaphs pay tribute to people whose remains have never been located, particularly those lost at sea. Some such cenotaphs are dedicated to victims of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; whose bodies were not recovered after the sinking. Although Isidor Straus&#x27;s body was recovered, Ida Straus&#x27;s body was not, and a cenotaph at the Straus Mausoleum at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx is dedicated to Isidor and Ida together. Its inscription reads: &quot;Many waters cannot quench love—neither can the floods drown it.&quot; () The striking cenotaph of Major Archibald Butt, aide to U.S. President William Taft, is located at Arlington National Cemetery.

In Inishmore, one of the Aran Islands of Ireland, drowning was formerly such a common cause of death for island fishermen that each family had a memorial to those lost at sea known as &quot;leachtaí cuimhneacháin&quot; (memorial cairns). Most were erected in the 19th century, although some date back to the eighteenth. A modern memorial was erected in 1997.

==Chhatris==

In India, cenotaphs are a basic element of Hindu architecture, later used by Moghuls as seen in most of the mausoleums of Mughal Emperors which have two burial chambers, the upper one with a cenotaph, as in Humayun&#x27;s Tomb, Delhi, or the Taj Mahal, Agra, while the real tomb often lies exactly below it, or further removed. The term &quot;chhatri&quot;, used for these canopylike structures, comes from Hindustani word literally meaning umbrella, and are found throughout the northwestern region of Rajasthan as well as in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In the Shekhawati region of Rajasthan, &quot;chhatri&quot;s are built on the cremation sites of wealthy or distinguished individuals. &quot;Chhatri&quot;s in Shekhawati may consist of a simple structure of one dome raised by four pillars to a building containing many domes and a basement with several rooms. In some places, the interior of the &quot;chhatri&quot; is painted in the same manner as the &quot;haveli&quot;.

==Art==
Cenotaphs have also been the subject of a number of illustrations including:
* &quot;The Cenotaph to Reynold&#x27;s Memory&quot; (John Constable, c. 1833)
* &quot;Elevation for Newton&#x27;s Cenotaph, Perspective&quot; (Etienne-Louis Boullée, c. 1785)
* &quot;The Cenotaph of Jean Jacques Rousseau&quot; (Hubert Robert, 1794)

==Digital and astronomical==
In the Internet age, virtual cenotaphs are common in the game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, as well as in &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series games though modding add-ons.

They have also been created in the augmented reality game &quot;Ingress&quot; in honour of the slain MIT police officer Sean Collier and in memory of the victims of the 1942 Struma disaster.

On 13 January 2016, Belgian amateur astronomers at MIRA Public Observatory dedicated, in conjunction with radio station Studio Brussels, an asterism of seven stars in the vicinity of Mars which had been photographed at the exact time of David Bowie&#x27;s death; when appropriately connected they form the iconic lightning bolt of &quot;Aladdin Sane.&quot;
