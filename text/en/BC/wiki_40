<text>Kobe Bean Bryant ( ; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the sport&#x27;s greatest and most influential players, Bryant won five NBA championships and was an 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. He ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. Bryant was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

The son of NBA player Joe Bryant, Bryant was born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy. Recognized as the top American high-school basketball player while at Philadelphia suburb Lower Merion High School, Bryant declared for the 1996 NBA draft and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th pick; he was then traded to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a reputation as a high-flyer by winning the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest and was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite his contentious relationship with teammate Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was charged with sexual assault. Charges were dropped after the accuser refused to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court, with Bryant issuing an apology and admitting to a sexual encounter he maintained was consensual.

After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O&#x27;Neal was traded and Bryant became the franchise&#x27;s cornerstone. He led the NBA in scoring in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points, the second most scored in a single NBA game behind Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point game. Bryant led the team to championships in 2009 and 2010, and was named NBA Finals MVP both times. He continued to be among the league&#x27;s premier players through the 2012–13 season when he suffered a torn achilles tendon. The last years of his playing career were hampered by injuries and limited playing time. Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season. In 2017, the Lakers retired both his Nos. 8 and 24, making Bryant the only player in NBA history to have multiple numbers retired by the same franchise.

The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20 seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the third most. His four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in history. Bryant gave himself the nickname Black Mamba in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the public. He won gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams. In 2018, Bryant won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for &quot;Dear Basketball&quot; (2017).

In January 2020, Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were among nine people who died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California. A number of tributes and memorials followed, and the All-Star MVP Award was renamed in Bryant&#x27;s honor.

== Early life ==
Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother, Pam Bryant ( Cox), is the sister of basketball player Chubby Cox, and his father, Joe Bryant, who played eight seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He has two older sisters: Sharia and Shaya. His father named him after the Kobe beef from Japan, which he saw on a restaurant menu, whereas his middle name, Bean, was derived from his father&#x27;s nickname &quot;Jellybean&quot;. Bryant&#x27;s family was Catholic and he was brought up with this faith.

Bryant started playing basketball at the age of three, and the Lakers were his favorite team when he was growing up. When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti in Italy to continue playing professional basketball. After two years, they moved first to Reggio Calabria, then to Pistoia and Reggio Emilia. Kobe became accustomed to his new lifestyle and learned to speak fluent Italian. He was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, which Kobe considered a loving place and where some of his best childhood memories were made. Kobe began to play basketball seriously while living in Reggio Emilia. His grandfather mailed him videos of NBA games for him to study. Another source of inspiration was animated European films about sports, from which Kobe learned more about basketball. From 1987 to 1989, his father played for Olimpia Basket Pistoia where he paired with former Detroit Pistons player Leon Douglas. Kobe worked at the games as a ball and mop boy and practiced shooting at halftime. Douglas said, &quot;At every one of our games at halftime, it was the Kobe show. He&#x27;d get out there and get his shot up. We&#x27;d come out of the locker room at halftime and have to chase him off the court&quot;.

Bryant also learned to play soccer, and his favorite soccer team was A.C. Milan. During summers, Bryant returned to the United States to play in a basketball summer league. When he was 13, Bryant and his family moved back to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in the eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

=== High school (1992–1996) ===

Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high-school career at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, located in the Philadelphia suburb of Lower Merion. He played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Bryant became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion&#x27;s varsity team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record. The following three years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions. During his junior year, Bryant averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.3 steals and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year while also earning a fourth-team &quot;Parade&quot; All-American nomination, attracting attention from college recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list. However, after high schooler Kevin Garnett went in the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant also began contemplating going directly to the pros.

At Adidas ABCD Camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP award while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom. While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry Stackhouse. As a senior, Bryant led the Aces to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots in leading the Aces to a 31–3 record. Bryant finished his high-school career as Southeastern Pennsylvania&#x27;s all-time leading scorer at 2,883 points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.

Bryant received several awards for his outstanding performance during his senior year at Lower Merion. These included being named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men&#x27;s National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald&#x27;s All-American, a first-team &quot;Parade&quot; All-American and a &quot;USA Today&quot; All-USA First Team player. Bryant&#x27;s varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented that he was &quot;a complete player who dominates&quot; and praised his work ethic, even as the team&#x27;s top player. In 1996, Bryant took R&amp;B singer Brandy to her Hollywood High senior prom. Ultimately, the 17-year-old Bryant decided to go directly into the NBA, becoming only the sixth player in NBA history to do so. His news was met with a significant publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years). His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission to any college Bryant chose, but he did not officially visit any campuses. In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans for his high school play as well as his later accomplishments.

== Professional career ==

=== 1996 NBA draft ===

Before the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper and, according to then-Laker general manager Jerry West, &quot;marched over these people.&quot;

The Lakers were looking to trade their starting center Vlade Divac for a player&#x27;s draft rights to free up salary cap space to make an offer to free-agent center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Bill Branch, the Charlotte Hornets&#x27; head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft. Before the trade agreement, the Hornets never considered drafting Bryant. During the draft, the Lakers told the Hornets whom to select minutes before the pick was made. Bryant was the first guard drafted directly out of high school. After the draft, the trade was put in jeopardy when Divac threatened to retire rather than be traded from Los Angeles. However, on June 30, Divac relented on his threat and the trade was made final on July 9, 1996, when the league&#x27;s off-season ended. Since Bryant was still 17 at the time, his parents had to co-sign his contract with the Lakers until Bryant was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began. Bryant signed a three-year rookie contract totaling $3.5 million.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2016) ===
==== Adjusting to the NBA (1996–1999) ====
Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris. Bryant scored 36 points in the finale and finished with averages of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four games. As a rookie in 1996–97, Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel. At the time, he was the second-youngest player ever to play in an NBA game (18 years, 72 days) and also became the youngest NBA starter (18 years, 158 days). Initially, Bryant played limited minutes, but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time.

By the end of the season, Bryant averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star weekend, he participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion at the age of 18. Bryant&#x27;s performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight.

The Lakers advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game 5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was ejected for fighting with Utah&#x27;s Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bryant shot four air balls at the end of the game; the Jazz won 98–93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4–1. He first missed a game-winning two-point jump shot in the fourth quarter, and then misfired three three-point field goals in overtime, including two tying shots in the final minute. O&#x27;Neal commented that &quot;[Bryant] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that.&quot;

In Bryant&#x27;s second season, he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant&#x27;s point averages more than doubled, from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game. He would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers &quot;played small&quot;, which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he would usually back up. Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA&#x27;s Sixth Man of the Year Award, and through fan voting, he also became the youngest NBA All-Star starter in NBA history. Bryant was joined by teammates O&#x27;Neal, Van Exel, and Jones, making it the first time since 1983 that four players on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant&#x27;s 15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.

The 1998–99 season marked Bryant&#x27;s emergence as a premier guard in the league. With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded, Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. During the season, he signed a six-year contract extension worth $70 million. This kept Bryant with the Lakers until the end of the 2003–04 season. Even at an early stage of his career, sportswriters were comparing Bryant&#x27;s skills to those of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson. However, the playoff results were no better as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Semifinals.

==== Three-peat (1999–2002) ====

Bryant&#x27;s fortunes improved when Phil Jackson took over as coach of the Lakers in 1999. After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league&#x27;s All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defensive teams. The Lakers became championship contenders behind the center-guard combination of Bryant and O&#x27;Neal. Jackson utilized the triangle offense that he implemented to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls; this offense would help both Bryant and O&#x27;Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. Three championships were won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and 2002, further cementing this view.

Bryant was sidelined for six weeks prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season due to a hand injury that he had incurred during a preseason game against the Washington Wizards. When Bryant was back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he had an increase in all statistical categories during the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O&#x27;Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O&#x27;Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player to receive All-Defensive honors). While playing second fiddle to O&#x27;Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch performances, including a 25-point, 11-rebound, seven-assist, four-block game in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers. He also threw an alley-oop pass to O&#x27;Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the 2000 Finals, against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers&#x27; Jalen Rose&#x27;s foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally. Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half and led the team to an overtime victory as O&#x27;Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120–118. With a 116–111 victory in Game 6, the Lakers won their first championship since 1988.

Statistically, the 2000–01 season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, but he averaged six more points per game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O&#x27;Neal began to surface. Once again, Bryant led the team in assists, with five per game. However, the Lakers only won 56 games, an 11-game drop-off from the previous year. The team responded by going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the semifinals round, the Lakers swept the Sacramento Kings. In Game 4 against the Kings, Bryant recorded 48 points, 16 rebounds, and three assists in a 119–113 series-clinching victory. They swept the San Antonio Spurs in the Conference Finals to advance to the Finals, before losing their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime. They would go on to win the next four games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O&#x27;Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league. Bryant ended up making the All-NBA Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. He was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the third year in a row (no game in 1999).

In the 2001–02 season, Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. On January 14, 2002, Bryant recorded a then career-high 56 points to go along with five rebounds and four assists in a 120–81 victory over the visiting Memphis Grizzlies. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. Bryant also had a career-high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. Bryant claimed his first All-Star MVP trophy after a 31-point performance in Philadelphia when he was loudly booed by fans as they had throughout the game, stemming from his earlier comment to a 76ers heckler during the Finals that the Lakers were &quot;going to cut your hearts out.&quot; While making the All-NBA Defensive Team again, Bryant was also named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second in the Pacific Division behind in-state rival Sacramento Kings. Bryant was suspended for one game after he punched Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers after the Lakers&#x27; March 1, 2002, victory over the Pacers.

The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had enjoyed the previous year. While they swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Lakers did not have home-court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to seven games, the first time this had happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive NBA Finals appearance. In the 2002 Finals against the New Jersey Nets, Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the team&#x27;s points. At age 23, he became the youngest player to win three championships. Bryant&#x27;s play was notable and praised for his performance in the fourth quarter of games, specifically the last two rounds of the playoffs. This cemented Bryant&#x27;s reputation as a &quot;clutch player.&quot;

==== Coming up short (2002–2004) ====

In the first game of the 2002–03 season, Bryant recorded 27 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 87–82 loss to the visiting Spurs. On November 1, he recorded a triple-double of 33 points, 15 rebounds, and 12 assists in a 108–93 victory over the Clippers. Bryant also set an NBA record for three-pointers in a game on January 7, 2003, when he made 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics. He averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting 40 or more points in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. Bryant also averaged 6.9 rebounds, 5.9 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, all career-highs to that point. He was once again voted to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams, and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers floundered in the playoffs and lost in the Western Conference semifinals in six games to the eventual NBA champions San Antonio Spurs.

The following season, the Lakers were able to acquire NBA All-Stars Karl Malone and Gary Payton to make another push at the NBA championship. Bryant was arrested for sexual assault before the season began. This caused him to miss some games due to court appearances or attend court earlier in the day and travel to play games later on the same day. In the final game of the regular season, the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers. Bryant made two buzzer-beaters to win the game and the Pacific Division title. At the end of the fourth quarter, Bryant made a three-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to send it into overtime. The game eventually went to a second overtime, in which Bryant made another three-pointer as time expired to narrowly lift the Lakers past the Blazers, 105–104.

With a starting lineup of O&#x27;Neal, Malone, Payton, and Bryant, the Lakers were able to reach the 2004 Finals. However, they were upset in five games by the Detroit Pistons, who won their first championship since 1990. In that series, Bryant averaged 22.6 points per game and 4.4 assists while shooting 35.1% from the field. Jackson&#x27;s contract as coach was not renewed, and Rudy Tomjanovich took over. O&#x27;Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler, and Brian Grant. The following day, Bryant declined a six-year, $100 million offer to sign with the Los Angeles Clippers and re-signed with the Lakers on a seven-year, $136.4 million contract.

==== Scoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007) ====

Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Jackson wrote &quot;The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul&quot;. The book detailed the events of the Lakers&#x27; tumultuous 2003–04 season and has several criticisms of Bryant. In the book, Jackson called Bryant &quot;un-coachable.&quot; Midway through the season, Tomjanovich suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion. Without him, stewardship of the remainder of the Lakers&#x27; season fell to career assistant coach Frank Hamblen. Bryant was the league&#x27;s second-leading scorer at 27.6 points per game, but he was surrounded by a subpar supporting cast, and the Lakers went 34–48 and missed the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. The year signified a drop in his overall status in the NBA, as Bryant did not make the NBA All-Defensive Team and was also demoted to the All-NBA Third Team. During the season, Bryant also engaged in public feuds with Malone and Ray Allen.

The 2005–06 season marked a crossroads in Bryant&#x27;s basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned to coach the Lakers. Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, they worked well together the second time around, leading the Lakers back into the playoffs. Bryant&#x27;s individual scoring accomplishments resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, he had personally outscored the entire Mavericks team 62–61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since the introduction of the shot clock. When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them. A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two were seen laughing together.

On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points in a 122–104 victory over the Toronto Raptors. In addition to breaking the previous franchise record of 71 set by Elgin Baylor, Bryant&#x27;s 81-point game was the second-highest point total in NBA history, surpassed only by Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point game in 1962. Whereas Chamberlain was fed repeatedly by teammates for inside shots in a blowout win, Bryant created his own shot—mostly from the outside—in a game which the Lakers trailed at halftime by 14 and did not pull away until the fourth quarter. Chamberlain, playing in an era when the games were paced faster and scoring opportunities were more plentiful, accounted for 59 percent of his team&#x27;s points in Philadelphia&#x27;s 169–147 victory, compared to Bryant scoring 66 percent of the Lakers&#x27; 122 points. That same month, he also became the first player since 1964 to score 45 points or more in four consecutive games, joining Chamberlain and Baylor as the only players to do so. For the month of January, Bryant averaged 43.4 points per game, the eighth highest single month scoring average in NBA history and highest for any player other than Chamberlain. By the end of the 2005–06 season, Bryant set Lakers single-season franchise records for most 40-point games (27) and most points scored (2,832). He won the league&#x27;s scoring title for the first time by averaging 35.4 points per game, becoming just the fifth player in league history to average at least 35 in a season. Bryant finished in fourth place in the voting for the 2006 NBA Most Valuable Player Award but received 22 first place votes—second only to winner Steve Nash.

Later in the season, it was reported that Bryant would change his jersey number from 8 to 24 at the start of the 2006–07 season. Bryant&#x27;s first high-school number was 24 before he switched to 33. After the Lakers&#x27; season ended, Bryant said on TNT that he wanted 24 as a rookie, but it was unavailable as it was worn by George McCloud, as was 33, retired with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bryant wore 143 at the Adidas ABCD camp and chose 8 by adding those numbers. In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers played well enough to reach a 3–1 series lead over the Phoenix Suns, culminating with Bryant&#x27;s overtime-forcing and game-winning shots in Game 4. They came within six seconds of eliminating the second-seeded Suns in Game 6, but the Lakers lost that game 126–118 in overtime. Despite Bryant&#x27;s 27.9 points per game in the series, the Lakers broke down and ultimately fell to the Suns in seven games. After scoring 50 points on 20 of 35 shooting in the Game 6 loss, Bryant was criticized for only taking three shots in the second half of the 121–90 Game 7 loss to Phoenix.
During the 2006–07 season, Bryant was selected to his ninth All-Star Game appearance, and on February 18, he logged 31 points, six assists, and six steals, earning his second career All-Star Game MVP trophy. Over the course of the season, Bryant became involved in a number of on-court incidents. On January 28, while attempting to draw contact on a potential game-winning jump shot, he flailed his arm, striking San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginóbili in the face with his elbow. Following a league review, Bryant was suspended for the subsequent game at Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks. The basis given for the suspension was that Bryant had performed an &quot;unnatural motion&quot; in swinging his arm backward. Later, on March 6, he seemed to repeat the motion, this time striking Minnesota Timberwolves guard Marko Jarić. The next day, the NBA handed Bryant his second one-game suspension. In his first game back on March 9, Bryant elbowed Kyle Korver in the face, which was retroactively re-classified as a Type 1 flagrant foul.

On March 16, Bryant scored a season-high 65 points in a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers, which helped end the Lakers seven-game losing streak. This was the second-best scoring performance of his 11-year career. The following game, Bryant recorded 50 points against the Timberwolves, after which he scored 60 points in a road win against the Memphis Grizzlies—becoming the second Laker to score three straight 50-plus point games, a feat not seen since Jordan last did it in 1987. The only other Laker to do so was Baylor, who also scored 50+ in three consecutive contests in December 1962. The next day, in a game against the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, Bryant scored 50 points, making him the second player in NBA history to have four straight 50-point games behind Chamberlain, who achieved it twice with streaks of five and seven. Bryant finished the year with a total of 10 50-plus point games, surpassed only by Chamberlain. Bryant also won his second straight scoring title that season. Throughout the 2006–07 season, Bryant&#x27;s jersey became the top selling NBA jersey in the United States and China. A number of journalists have attributed the improved sales to Bryant&#x27;s new number, as well as his continuing All-Star performance on the court. In the 2007 NBA playoffs, the Lakers were once again eliminated in the first round by the Phoenix Suns, 4–1.

==== Back on top (2007–2010) ====
On May 27, 2007, ESPN reported that Bryant stated that he wanted to be traded if Jerry West did not return to the team with full authority. Bryant later confirmed his desire for West&#x27;s return to the franchise, but denied stating that he would want to be traded if that did not take place. However, three days later, on Stephen A. Smith&#x27;s radio program, Bryant expressed anger over a Lakers &quot;insider&quot; who claimed that Bryant was responsible for Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s departure from the team, and publicly stated, &quot;I want to be traded.&quot; Three hours after making that statement, Bryant stated in another interview that after having a conversation with head coach Jackson, he had reconsidered his decision and backed off his trade request. Bryant was later shown in an infamous amateur video saying that center Andrew Bynum should have been traded for All-Star Jason Kidd.
On December 23, 2007, Bryant became the youngest player (29 years, 122 days) to reach 20,000 points, in a game against the New York Knicks, in Madison Square Garden, after scoring 39 points to go along with 11 rebounds and eight assists. This record has since been broken by LeBron James. On March 28, Bryant scored a season-high 53 points to go along with 10 rebounds in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies.

Despite an injury to his shooting hand&#x27;s small finger, described as &quot;a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament, an avulsion fracture, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint&quot; that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, Bryant stated, &quot;I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer&#x27;s Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that and the Lakers&#x27; medical staff will just have to continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis.&quot;

Aided by the trade for All-Star Pau Gasol, Bryant led his team to a West-leading 57–25 record. The Lakers swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round and on May 6, 2008, Bryant was officially announced as the league MVP. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s been a long ride. I&#x27;m very proud to represent this organization, to represent this city.&quot; West, who was responsible for bringing Bryant to the Lakers, was on hand at the press conference to observe Bryant receive his MVP trophy from NBA commissioner David Stern. Stern stated, &quot;Kobe deserved it. He&#x27;s had just another great season. Doesn&#x27;t surprise me one bit.&quot; In addition to winning his MVP award, Bryant was the only unanimous selection to the All-NBA team on May 8, 2008, for the third straight season and sixth time in his career. Bryant would then headline the NBA All-Defensive First Team with Kevin Garnett, receiving 52 points overall including 24 first-place nods, earning his eighth selection.

The Lakers finished the 2007–08 regular season with a 57–25 record, finishing first in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Nuggets. In Game 1, Bryant, who said he made himself a decoy through most of the game, scored 18 of his 32 points in the final eight minutes to keep Los Angeles safely ahead. That made Denver the first 50-win team to be swept out of the first round of the playoffs since the Memphis Grizzlies fell in four games to the San Antonio Spurs in 2004. In the first game of the next round, against the Utah Jazz, Bryant scored 38 points as the Lakers beat the Jazz in Game 1. The Lakers won the next game as well, but dropped Games 3 and 4, even with Bryant putting up 33.5 points per game. The Lakers then won the next two games to win the semifinals. This set up a Western Conference Finals berth against the Spurs. The Lakers won the series in five games, sending themselves to the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. This marked the fifth time in Bryant&#x27;s career, and the first time without O&#x27;Neal, that he made the NBA Finals. The Lakers then lost to the Celtics in six games.
In early September 2008, Bryant decided not to have surgery to repair his right pinkie. In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers opened the campaign by winning their first seven games. Bryant led the team to tie the franchise record for most wins to start the season going 17–2, and by the middle of December they compiled a 21–3 record. He was selected to his 11th consecutive All-Star Game as a starter, and was named the Western Conference Player of the Month for December and January in addition to being named Western Conference Player of the week three times. In a game against the Knicks on February 2, 2009, Bryant scored 61 points, setting a record for the most points scored at Madison Square Garden. During the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant tallied 27 points, four assists, four rebounds, and four steals and was awarded All-Star Game co-MVP with former teammate O&#x27;Neal. The Lakers finished the regular season with the best record in the West (65–17). Bryant was runner-up in the MVP voting behind James, and was selected to the All-NBA First Team and All-Defensive First Team for the seventh time in his career.

In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Utah Jazz in five games and the Houston Rockets in seven games in the opening two rounds. By finishing off the Denver Nuggets in the Conference Finals in six games, the Lakers earned their second straight trip to the NBA Finals. The Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in five games. Bryant was awarded his first NBA Finals MVP trophy upon winning his fourth championship, achieving series averages of 32.4 points, 7.4 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks. Bryant became the first player since West in the 1969 NBA Finals to average at least 32.4 points and 7.4 assists for a Finals series and the first since Jordan to average 30 points, five rebounds, and five assists for a title-winning team in the Finals. Bryant was the league&#x27;s leading scorer throughout the 2000s decade, accumulating 21,065 points in regular season play between the 1999-00 and 2008–09 seasons.

During the 2009–10 season, Bryant made six game-winning shots including a buzzer-beating, one-legged three-pointer over Dwyane Wade on December 4, 2009, leading to the Lakers&#x27; narrow 108–107 victory over the Miami Heat. Bryant considered the shot &quot;one of the luckiest he has made.&quot; A week later, Bryant suffered an avulsion fracture in his right index finger in a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite the injury, Bryant elected to continue playing, rather than take any time off to rest the injury. Five days after his finger injury, Bryant made another game-winning shot, after missing on an opportunity in regulation, this time against the Milwaukee Bucks in an overtime game. Bryant also became the youngest player (31 years, 151 days) to reach 25,000 points in his career during the season, surpassing Chamberlain. Bryant continued his dominant clutch plays making yet another game-winning three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, and what would be the game-winning field goal against the Boston Celtics. The following day, Bryant surpassed West to become the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. After being sidelined for five games by an ankle injury, which also forced him to miss the 2010 NBA All-Star Game despite being the Western Conference&#x27;s leading vote-getter, Bryant made his return and made another clutch three-pointer to give the Lakers a one-point lead with four seconds remaining against the Memphis Grizzlies. Two weeks later, he made his sixth game-winning shot of the season, against the Toronto Raptors.

On April 2, 2010, Bryant signed a three-year contract extension worth $87 million. He finished the regular season missing four of the final five games, due to injuries to his knee and finger. Bryant suffered multiple injuries throughout the season and missed nine games as a result. The Lakers began the playoffs as the No. 1-seed in the Western Conference against the Oklahoma City Thunder, eventually defeating them in six games. The Lakers swept the Utah Jazz in the second round and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Phoenix Suns. In Game 2, Bryant finished the game with 13 assists, setting a new playoff career-high; it was the most assists by a Laker in the playoffs since Magic Johnson had 13 in 1996. The Lakers went on to win the series in six games capturing the Western Conference Championship and advancing to the NBA Finals for a third straight season. In a rematch against the 2008 Champion Boston Celtics, Bryant, despite shooting 6-for-24 from the field, led the Lakers back from a 13-point third-quarter deficit in Game 7 to win the championship; he scored 10 of his game-high 23 points in the fourth quarter and finished the game with 15 rebounds, tying an NBA Finals record shared by Sam Jones and Tom Gola for rebounds by a shooting guard. Bryant won his fifth championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. This marked the first time the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Celtics in the NBA Finals. Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all of his five championships.

==== Chasing a sixth championship (2010–2013) ====

Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan&#x27;s total. The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games. In his ninth game of the season, playing against the Denver Nuggets, Bryant became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 26,000 career points. Bryant also recorded his first triple-double since January 21, 2009. On January 30, 2011, against the Celtics, Bryant became the youngest player to score 27,000 points. Two days later, Bryant became one of seven players with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. In Boston on February 10, Bryant scored 20 of his 23 points in the second half as the Lakers rallied from an early 15-point deficit for a 92–86 victory over the Celtics. It was the Lakers&#x27; first victory of the season against one of the league&#x27;s top four teams, as they entered the game 0–5 in previous matchups and had been outscored by an average of 11 points. Bryant, selected to his 13th straight All-Star game after becoming the leading vote-getter, had 37 points, 14 rebounds, and three steals in the 2011 All-Star Game and won his fourth All-Star MVP, tying Hall of Famer Bob Pettit for the most All-Star MVP awards. During the season, Bryant moved from 12th to sixth place on the NBA all-time career scoring list, passing John Havlicek, Dominique Wilkins, Oscar Robertson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Elvin Hayes, and Moses Malone. Bryant finished the season averaging less than 20 shots a game, his fewest since the 2003–04 season.

On April 13, 2011, the NBA fined Bryant $100,000 for directing a gay slur at referee Bennie Adams in frustration in the previous day&#x27;s game. The Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation praised the NBA&#x27;s decision to fine Bryant, and the Human Rights Campaign said that Bryant&#x27;s language was a &quot;disgrace&quot; and &quot;distasteful.&quot; Bryant stated that he was open to discussing the matter with gay rights groups and wanted to appeal his fine. Bryant later apologized for the use of the word. Bryant and other Lakers appeared in a Lakers public service announcement denouncing his behavior. The team&#x27;s quest for another three-peat was ended when they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs.
Bryant received experimental platelet-rich plasma therapy called Orthokine in Germany to treat the pain on his left knee and ankle, and Mike Brown replaced the retired Jackson as coach of the Lakers in the off-season. Bryant began the season playing with an injured wrist. On January 10, 2012, he scored 48 points against the Suns. &quot;Not bad for the seventh-best player in the league,&quot; said Bryant, referring to a preseason ESPN ranking of the NBA&#x27;s top players. He went on to score 40, 42, and 42 in his next three games. It was the sixth time in his career Bryant scored 40 or more points in four straight games, a feat exceeded only by Chamberlain (19 times). At the 2012 NBA All-Star Game, Bryant scored 27 points to pass Jordan as the career scoring leader in the All-Star Game. He also suffered a broken nose and a concussion in the third quarter of the All-Star Game after a hard foul from Dwyane Wade. In April, Bryant missed seven games with a bruised left shin. He returned three games before the end of the regular season. Bryant sat out the season finale against Sacramento, foregoing the chase for a possible third NBA scoring title, having needed 38 points to surpass Kevin Durant. The Lakers were knocked out of the playoffs by Durant and Oklahoma City in the second round of the playoffs, losing in five games in what would be Bryant&#x27;s final postseason appearance.

In 2012–13, the Lakers acquired center Dwight Howard and point guard Steve Nash. On November 2, 2012, Bryant scored 40 points with two steals, and he passed Magic Johnson (1,724) as the Lakers career leader in steals. However, the Lakers lost the game to the Clippers and started the season 0–3 for the first time in 34 years and just the fourth time in franchise history. After starting the season 1–4, coach Brown was fired. He was replaced by Mike D&#x27;Antoni, whom Bryant knew as a child when Bryant&#x27;s father was playing in Italy and D&#x27;Antoni was also a star player there. Bryant had grown close with D&#x27;Antoni during their time with Team USA. On December 5 against New Orleans, Bryant became the youngest player (34 years and 104 days) in league history to score 30,000 points, joining Hall of Famers Chamberlain, Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Karl Malone as the fifth player to reach that milestone. On December 18, in a narrow 101–100 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats, Bryant scored 30+ points in his seventh consecutive game, the longest streak by an NBA player after turning 34 years old; it was the fourth-longest such streak in his career. Bryant&#x27;s streak would be snapped at 10 on December 28 in a 104–87 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, when he scored 27 points, sitting out the whole fourth quarter. In a move to improve the team&#x27;s defense, D&#x27;Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent&#x27;s best perimeter player; he was the primary defender on the Cavaliers&#x27; Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender after having a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when Bryant played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups.
Bryant was leading the league in scoring through much of the first 42 games. With a disappointing 17–25 start to the season, D&#x27;Antoni had Bryant became the primary facilitator on offense and Nash was moved off the ball and became more of a spot-up shooter. In the next three games, Bryant had at least 10 assists in three wins with a three-game total of 39 assists, the most in his career. Bryant missed a triple-double in each game with nine rebounds twice and eight in the other. In two crucial wins in March, he scored at least 40 points and had at least 10 assists in back-to-back games, becoming the first Laker to accomplish the feat since West in 1970. Bryant surpassed Chamberlain to become the fourth-leading scorer in league history in a March 30, 2013, victory over Sacramento.

With the Lakers fighting to secure the eighth and final playoff berth in the Western Conference, coupled with injuries on the team, Bryant began playing almost all 48 minutes each game. On April 10, 2013, he became the first player in NBA history to get 47 points, eight rebounds, five assists, four blocks, and three steals in a game. Two days later, Bryant suffered a torn Achilles tendon against the Golden State Warriors, ending his season. Bryant&#x27;s injury came while he was playing seven consecutive quarters and at least 40 minutes for seven consecutive games. The 34-year-old Bryant was averaging his most minutes (38.6) in six years, and only Portland rookie Damian Lillard was averaging more minutes. Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak had spoken to Bryant about his extensive playing time 10 days earlier, but Bryant insisted the minutes needed to continue given the Lakers&#x27; playoff push. He had surgery on April 13 to repair the tear, and it was estimated that he would miss six to nine months. Bryant ended the season with customary averages of 27.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 6 assists per game on 46.3% shooting. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called his leading of the Lakers back into playoff contention &quot;perhaps some of the finest work of his career.&quot; He reached 40 points eight times during the season, and Bryant had 10 or more assists in his role as distributor 11 times. Bryant was dubbed &quot;Magic Mamba&quot; after the passing skills of Magic Johnson. Bryant&#x27;s assists were the second-highest of his career and his field goal percentage was its highest since 2008–09. The Lakers finished the season at 45–37, good for seventh in the West. Playing without Bryant, the Lakers were swept in four games by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.

==== Injury-plagued years (2013–2015) ====

Bryant resumed practicing in November 2013, after the 2013–14 season had already begun. On November 25, he signed a two-year contract extension with the Lakers at an estimated value of $48.5 million. Bryant remained the league&#x27;s highest-paid player, although he accepted a discounted deal; Bryant had been eligible to receive an extension starting at $32 million per year. His contract became a polarizing topic, with detractors arguing that stars should take less money to allow their team more financial freedom, while supporters countered that the NBA&#x27;s biggest stars were being paid less than their true value. Bryant resumed playing on December 8 after missing the season&#x27;s first 19 games, being limited to nine points, although tying a team-high in assists and rebounds, with eight and four respectively, in 106–94 home loss to the Toronto Raptors. Nine days later, he matched his season high of 21 points in a 96–92 win over Memphis, but suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee that was expected to sideline him for six weeks. Bryant had played six games since returning from his Achilles injury, which included time at point guard after injuries to Nash, Steve Blake, and Jordan Farmar. Bryant was averaging 13.8 points, 6.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds. Despite being sidelined, he was voted by fans to start in his 16th All-Star game. Bryant did not feel he was deserving of the selection, and some likened it to a career achievement award for his past performance. However, Bryant missed playing in the game, still hampered by his knee. On March 12, 2014, the Lakers ruled Bryant out for the rest of the season, citing his need for more rehab and the limited time remaining in the season. At the time, the team was 22–42 and tied for the worst record in the Western Conference. The Lakers finished 27–55 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.

Bryant returned for the 2014–15 season, his 19th season with the Lakers, who had replaced D&#x27;Antoni with Bryant&#x27;s former Lakers teammate, Byron Scott. On November 30, 2014, in a 129–122 overtime victory over the Toronto Raptors, Bryant recorded his 20th career triple-double with 31 points, 12 assists, and 11 rebounds. At age 36, Bryant became the oldest NBA player to achieve 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a game. On December 14, he became the NBA&#x27;s third all-time leading scorer, passing Jordan (32,292) in a 100–94 victory over Minnesota. Bryant played in the first 27 games of the season, averaging team-highs with 26.4 points and 35.4 minutes per game while leading the league with 22.4 shots per game. However, Scott held him out for three straight games to rest after one of his worst performances of the season, when Bryant committed nine turnovers and scored 25 points on just 8-for-30 shooting in a 108–101 loss to Sacramento. He was suffering from soreness in his knees, feet, back, and Achilles tendons, and Scott planned to reduce Bryant&#x27;s workload going forward as a result. Bryant had exceeded 40 minutes in a game thrice, and the coach blamed himself for overloading Bryant after he started the season in such great shape. For the season, Bryant had been shooting just 37 percent from the field, and the team&#x27;s record was only 8–19. In his second game back after resting, Bryant had 23 points, 11 assists, and 11 rebounds in a 111–103 victory over Denver, and became just the third player in league history to record multiple triple-doubles in a season at age 36 or older. On January 21, 2015, Bryant suffered a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder while driving baseline for a two-handed dunk against the New Orleans Pelicans. Though he was right-handed, Bryant returned to play in the game and ran the offense while shooting, dribbling, and passing almost exclusively with his left hand. Prior to the injury, Bryant had been rested in eight of 16 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for the injury, finishing the season averaging 22.3 points but shooting a career-low 37.3 percent, well below his 45.4 percent career mark to start the season. Bryant was expected to be sidelined for nine months with a return targeted toward the start of the 2015–16 season. The Lakers finished the season with a record of 21–61, surpassing the franchise record for most losses in a season that they had set the previous year.

==== Final season (2015–2016) ====

After recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason, Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games. However, he played in the season opener to begin his 20th season with the Lakers, surpassing John Stockton&#x27;s league record of 19 for the most seasons with the same team. On November 24, 2015, the Lakers fell to 2–12 after losing 111–77 to the Warriors. Bryant scored just four points in 25 minutes on 1-for-14 shooting, matching the worst-shooting game of his career in which he attempted at least five shots. A week later, Bryant played his last game against his hometown team, the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring a team-high 20 points in a 103–91 Lakers loss.

On November 29, 2015, Bryant announced via &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot; that he would be retiring at the end of the season. In his poem titled &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, Bryant wrote that he fell in love with the game at age six: &quot;A love so deep I gave you my all/From my mind &amp; body/To my spirit &amp; soul.&quot; The 2015–16 season &quot;is all I have left to give./My heart can take the pounding/My mind can handle the grind/But my body knows it&#x27;s time to say goodbye./And that&#x27;s OK./I&#x27;m ready to let you go.&quot; In a letter distributed to Lakers&#x27; fans before that evening&#x27;s game against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant wrote: &quot;What you&#x27;ve done for me is far greater than anything I&#x27;ve done for you. ... My love for this city, this team and for each of you will never fade. Thank you for this incredible journey.&quot;

At the time of his announcement, Bryant was second on the team in minutes (30.8) behind Jordan Clarkson and leading the team with 16.7 field goal attempts per game, while averaging just 15.7 points and shooting a career-low 31.5 percent. Bryant&#x27;s free throw attempts had dropped from his career average, and his game had become over-reliant on pump fakes and long-range shots, making a league-worst 19.5 percent from three-point range while attempting seven a game, almost double his career average. In his press conference after the announcement, Bryant acknowledged his declining skills. He stated: &quot;Even though I play like shit, I&#x27;ve worked really, really hard not to play like crap and I do everything I possibly can. And I feel good about that.&quot;

Bryant requested that opposing teams on the road not hold any on-court ceremonies in his honor or present him any gifts in public. Prior to announcing his retirement, Bryant had been steadfast about not wanting the fuss of a staged farewell tour, preferring to hear boos instead of cheers. However, Bryant was still honored around the league with video tributes and fan ovations, including arenas that historically jeered him such as TD Garden in Boston, Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Moda Center in Portland, Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento, and Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City. Previously, Bryant was respected but not beloved, and he was astonished at the cheers he was now receiving.
On February 3, Bryant made seven three-pointers and scored a then season-high 38 points, including 14 of the team&#x27;s 18 points in the last 5:02 of the game, for a 119–115 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves. The win ended a 10-game losing streak, and the Lakers averted establishing the longest losing streak in franchise history. He became just the fourth NBA player over 37 years old to log at least 35 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a game. Bryant was the leading overall vote-getter for the 2016 All-Star Game with 1.9 million votes, ahead of Stephen Curry&#x27;s 1.6 million. Having moved to small forward that season, Bryant was selected as a frontcourt starter for the first time. Playing in his first All-Star game since 2013, Bryant had 10 points, six rebounds, and seven assists. West teammates offered to feed him the ball in an attempt to get him another All-Star MVP, but Bryant declined.

In the season finale on April 13, Bryant scored an NBA season-high 60 points against the Utah Jazz in his last NBA game, outscoring the entire Jazz team 23–21 in the fourth quarter, in the Lakers&#x27; 101–96 victory. Bryant became the oldest player to score 60 or more points in a game at 37 years and 234 days old. Following the victory, Bryant would address the Staples Center crowd, bidding farewell and thanking them for their prolonged support, notably closing out his speech with, &quot;What can I say? Mamba out&quot;. The Lakers finished the season with a 17–65 record, their worst record in franchise history.
== National team career ==
Bryant declined to play in the 2000 Olympics because he was getting married in the off-season. Bryant also decided not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship. He was originally selected for the FIBA Americas Championship in 2003, but withdrew after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder and knee surgeries. The following summer, Bryant had to withdraw from the Olympic team because of his sexual assault case. Along with LeBron James, Bryant was one of the first two players to be publicly named to the 2006–2008 U.S. preliminary roster in 2006 by Jerry Colangelo. However, he was once again sidelined after knee surgery and did not participate in the 2006 FIBA World Championship.

Bryant&#x27;s United States national team career finally began in 2007. He was a member of the 2007 USA Men&#x27;s Senior National Team and USA FIBA Americas Championship Team that finished 10–0, won gold and qualified the United States men for the 2008 Olympics. Bryant started in all 10 of the USA&#x27;s FIBA Americas Championship games. He averaged 15.3 points, 2.9 assists, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.6 steals per game in the tournament.

On June 23, 2008, Bryant was named to the USA Men&#x27;s Senior National Team for the 2008 Summer Olympics. This was his first time going to the Olympics. Bryant scored 20 points, including 13 in the fourth quarter, along with six assists, as Team USA defeated Spain 118–107 in the gold medal game on August 24, 2008, for its first gold medal in a worldwide competition since the 2000 Olympics. He averaged 15.0 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.1 assists while shooting .462 from the field in eight Olympic contests.

Bryant rejoined the national team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. After winning another gold medal, he decided to retire from the team. Bryant finished his national team career with a record of 26–0 across three tournaments, winning a gold medal each time.

== Player profile ==
Bryant primarily played as a shooting guard. He was listed at and , Bryant was often cited as one of the most dangerous scorers in the NBA. He has drawn frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan, after whom Bryant modeled his playing style. Like Jordan, Bryant became most known for shooting a fall-away jump shot. Chris Ballard of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; described another of Bryant&#x27;s most famous moves as the &quot;jab step-and-pause&quot; in which Bryant jabbed his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax but instead of bringing the jab foot back, Bryant pushed off of it and drove around his opponent to get to the basket. Bryant also learned and practiced post moves through individual coaching sessions from Hakeem Olajuwon.

Bryant established a reputation for taking shots in the closing moments of tight games, even when he was double or triple-teamed, and was noted as one of the premier closers in the NBA. In a 2012 annual survey of NBA general managers, Bryant was selected for the 10th consecutive season as the player general managers would want to take a clutch shot with a game on the line. Bryant enjoyed being the villain, and reveled in being booed and then silencing the crowd with his play. Bryant&#x27;s ability to make difficult shots has also drawn criticism of his shot selection. Throughout his career, Bryant was disparaged for being a selfish, high-volume shooter; he missed more field goal attempts in his career than any other player in NBA history, until LeBron James broke that record in 2024. Phil Jackson, who coached Bryant for many years, stated that Bryant &quot;tends to force the action, especially when the game isn&#x27;t going his way. When his shot is off, Kobe will pound away relentlessly until his luck turns.&quot; According to Bryant, &quot;I would go 0 for 30 before I would go 0 for 9; 0 for 9 means you beat yourself, you psyched yourself out of the game.&quot;

In addition to his abilities on offense, Bryant also established himself as a standout defensive player. Bryant rarely drew charges when he played defense, which he believed spared his body and contributed to his longevity. However, some critics have suggested that Bryant&#x27;s defensive accolades in his later years were based more on his reputation than his actual play.

Bryant was also lauded for his relentless work ethic, dubbed the &quot;Mamba mentality.&quot; Throughout his first 17 seasons, Bryant&#x27;s body was resilient, and he exhibited a high pain threshold while often playing through injuries. A fierce competitor, Bryant made opponents and teammates alike the objects of his scorn. Many players have considered him difficult to play with because of his high level of commitment and performance. According to sportswriter Mark Heisler of &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;circa 2004–2007, Kobe was the most alienated superstar the NBA had ever seen.&quot; After the departure of Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, he led the Lakers to two NBA championships; during this period, Bryant became more of a mentor to his teammates than he had been earlier in his career. Bryant&#x27;s longtime head coach Phil Jackson noted a big difference during his two Lakers coaching stints in Bryant&#x27;s demeanor towards his teammates. If Bryant talked to teammates in his earlier years, it was usually &quot;give me the damn ball,&quot; but during the latter period, &quot;[Bryant] embraced the team and his teammates, calling them up when we were on the road and inviting them out to dinner. It was as if the other players were now his partners, not his personal spear-carriers.&quot;

== Off the court ==

=== Personal life ===
Bryant was the youngest of three children. He grew up with two older sisters, Sharia and Shaya, and had close relationships with them his entire life.

In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer on the Tha Eastsidaz music video &quot;G&#x27;d Up.&quot; Bryant was in the building and working on his debut album. They began dating and became engaged six months later in May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California. To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study. According to Vanessa&#x27;s cousin Laila Laine, there was no prenuptial agreement. Laila said Bryant &quot;loved her too much for one.&quot; They got married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point, California. The wedding was not attended by Bryant&#x27;s parents, his two sisters, his longtime advisor and agent Arn Tellem, or his Laker teammates. Bryant&#x27;s parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons—including, reportedly, his marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American. This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when the couple&#x27;s first daughter was born.

The Bryants&#x27; first daughter, Natalia, was born in January 2003. Due to an ectopic pregnancy, Vanessa suffered a miscarriage in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore (also referred to as &quot;Gigi&quot;), was born in May 2006. On December 16, 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, and the couple requested joint custody of their daughters. On January 11, 2013, Bryant and his wife announced via social media that they had called off their divorce. In early December 2016, Vanessa gave birth to their third daughter, and in January 2019, the Bryants announced they were expecting a fourth daughter, who was born in June 2019.

Bryant was a practicing Catholic. He said his faith and a priest helped him through difficult times, such as the period following his accusation of rape. A Catholic cantor said that she was inspired by Bryant&#x27;s faith, and the respect that he showed her. Bryant and his family were regular attendees at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newport Beach. He and his daughter, Gianna, received the Eucharist together just hours before they died.

Bryant was multilingual. He was fluent in English, Italian, and Spanish. Inspired by the codename for Uma Thurman&#x27;s character in the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; films, Bryant assigned himself the nickname of &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the eponymous snake&#x27;s ability to &quot;strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession.&quot; During the 2012–13 season, Bryant began referring to himself as &quot;vino&quot; to describe how his play had been aging like a fine wine.

In January 2002, Bryant bought a Mediterranean-style house for $4 million, located on a cul-de-sac in Newport Coast, Newport Beach. He sold the house in May 2015.

In 2013, Bryant had a legal disagreement with an auction house over memorabilia from his early years that his parents had put up for auction. Bryant&#x27;s parents received $450,000 from the auction house for the items, and contended Bryant had given her the rights to the items he had remaining in their home. However, Bryant&#x27;s lawyers asked the auction house to return the items. Before the scheduled trial, a settlement was reached allowing the auction house the sale of less than 10% of the items. Bryant&#x27;s parents apologized to him for the misunderstanding in a written statement, and appreciated the financial support he had given them over the years.

Bryant grew up a baseball fan and had been a long-time supporter of the Los Angeles Dodgers during his tenure with the Lakers. However, during the 2009 National League Championship Series when the Dodgers played his hometown Philadelphia Phillies, Bryant revealed to Craig Sager that he actually grew up a fan of their National League East archrivals, the New York Mets wanting to be like Darryl Strawberry and boasted that he still had a Ron Darling baseball card.

Bryant also was a lifelong fan of his hometown NFL team, the Philadelphia Eagles. Bryant was also a fan of soccer teams Barcelona, AC Milan, and Manchester City.

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, at the time of his retirement, Bryant&#x27;s $680 million in career earnings was the most ever by a team athlete during their playing career.

Bryant was a second cousin of his former Lakers teammate Cedric Ceballos.

==== Sexual assault case ====

In the summer of 2003, the sheriff&#x27;s office of Eagle, Colorado, arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. The accuser stated that Bryant raped her in his hotel room the night before he was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted to an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser but denied her sexual assault allegation. Bryant was charged on June 18, 2003.

The accusation had a negative impact on Bryant&#x27;s reputation, and the public&#x27;s perception of him plummeted; his endorsement contracts with McDonald&#x27;s and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant&#x27;s replica jersey fell significantly. In September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser decided not to testify at the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public &quot;mea culpa&quot;: &quot;Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.&quot; The accuser filed a separate lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides settled privately.

===Endorsements===
Before starting the 1996–97 season, Bryant signed a six-year contract with Adidas worth approximately $48 million. His first signature shoe was the Equipment KB 8. Bryant&#x27;s other, earlier endorsements included deals with The Coca-Cola Company to endorse their Sprite soft drink, appearing in advertisements for McDonald&#x27;s, promoting Spalding&#x27;s new NBA Infusion Ball, Upper Deck, Italian chocolate company Ferrero SpA&#x27;s brand Nutella, Russell Corporation, and appearing on his own series of video games by Nintendo. Many companies like McDonald&#x27;s and Ferrero SpA terminated Bryant&#x27;s contracts when rape allegations against him became public. A notable exception was Nike, Inc., who had signed Bryant to a five-year, $40–45 million contract just before the incident. They refused to use his image or market a new shoe of his for the year, but started promoting Bryant two years later, when his image had recovered. Bryant also resumed endorsement deals with The Coca-Cola Company, through their subsidiary Energy Brands, to promote their Vitamin Water brand of drinks. He was also the cover athlete for &quot;NBA &#x27;07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2&quot; and appeared in commercials for the video games &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; (with Tony Hawk, Michael Phelps, and Alex Rodriguez) in 2008 and &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; (alongside Jimmy Kimmel) in 2010.

In a 2008 video promoting Nike&#x27;s Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant appears to jump over a speeding Aston Martin. The stunt was considered fake, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said a real stunt would probably be a violation of Bryant&#x27;s Lakers contract. After promoting Nike&#x27;s Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant came out with the fourth edition of his signature line by Nike, the Zoom Kobe IV. In 2010, Nike launched another shoe, Nike Zoom Kobe V. In 2009, Bryant signed a deal with Nubeo to market the Black Mamba Collection, a line of sports/luxury watches ranging from $25,000 to $285,000. On February 9, 2009, he was featured on the cover of &quot;ESPN The Magazine—&quot;not for anything basketball related, but about his being a big fan of FC Barcelona. CNN estimated Bryant&#x27;s endorsement deals in 2007 to be worth $16 million a year. In 2010, he was ranked third, behind Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan, in &quot;Forbes&quot;″ list of the world&#x27;s highest-paid athletes, with $48 million.
On December 13, 2010, Bryant signed a two-year endorsement deal with Turkey&#x27;s national airline, Turkish Airlines; he appeared in a promotional film aired in over 80 countries, and appeared in digital, print and billboard advertising.

In September 2012, Bryant shot a commercial for Turkish Airlines with FC Barcelona star Lionel Messi. In the airline&#x27;s latest commercial, the duo competes to win the attention of a young boy. In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed Bryant the fifth-highest paid sports star in the world behind Floyd Mayweather, Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James, and Lionel Messi.

Bryant appeared as the cover athlete for the following video games:
* &quot;Kobe Bryant in NBA Courtside&quot;
* &quot;NBA Courtside 2: Featuring Kobe Bryant&quot;
* &quot;NBA Courtside 2002&quot;
* &quot;NBA 3 on 3 Featuring Kobe Bryant&quot;
* &quot;NBA &#x27;07: Featuring the Life Vol. 2&quot;

* &quot;NBA 2K21&quot; (Mamba Forever Edition)
* &quot;NBA 2K24&quot; (Kobe Bryant Edition and Black Mamba Edition)

Bryant was also one of the global ambassadors of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China.

===Music===
In high school, Bryant was a member of a rap group called CHEIZAW, named after the Chi Sah gang in the martial arts film &quot;Kid with the Golden Arm&quot;. The group was signed by Sony Entertainment, but the company&#x27;s ultimate goal was to eliminate the group and have Bryant record on his own. The label wanted to capitalize on Bryant&#x27;s youth and NBA fame. He performed at a 1997 concert by Sway &amp; King Tech and recorded a verse for a remix of Brian McKnight&#x27;s &quot;Hold Me.&quot; Bryant even appeared on Lakers teammate O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s &quot;Respect&quot;, starting the track &quot;3 X&#x27;s Dope&quot;, though Bryant&#x27;s name was not listed on the credits.

Sony pushed Bryant from his roots of underground hip hop into a more radio-friendly sound. His debut album, &quot;Visions&quot;, was scheduled to release in the spring of 2000. The first single, &quot;K.O.B.E&#x27;&quot;, featured supermodel Tyra Banks singing the hook. The single debuted in January 2000, and was performed at NBA All-Star Weekend that month, but it was not well received. Sony abandoned plans for the album, which was never released, and dropped Bryant later that year. The Sony president who originally signed Bryant had already left, and Bryant&#x27;s other backers had mostly abandoned him. Afterward, Bryant co-founded an independent record label, Heads High Entertainment, but it folded within a year. In 1999, he appeared on a remix of &quot;Say My Name&quot; by Destiny&#x27;s Child on the Maxi single version of the song.

In 2011, Bryant was featured in Taiwanese singer Jay Chou&#x27;s single &quot;The Heaven and Earth Challenge&quot; (天地一鬥, pronounced &quot;Tian Di Yi Dou&quot;). The proceeds for downloads of both the single and ringtones were donated to impoverished schools for basketball facilities and equipment. The music video of the single also features Bryant. The song was also used by Sprite in its 2011 marketing campaign in China.

In 2009, American rapper Lil Wayne released a song called &quot;Kobe Bryant.&quot; Similarly, in 2010, American rapper Sho Baraka released a song called &quot;Kobe Bryant On&#x27;em&quot;, which was featured on his album &quot;Lions and Liars&quot;. In 2012, American rapper Chief Keef released &quot;Kobe&quot;, a song paying tribute to Bryant. It was featured on his debut studio album, &quot;Finally Rich&quot;, as a part of the deluxe edition. For the &quot;NBA 2K21&quot; soundtrack, Damian Lillard, under his stage name Dame D.O.L.L.A., released a tribute track also titled &quot;Kobe,&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg and Derrick Milano.

=== Film and television ===
Bryant made his acting debut in 1996, appearing in an episode of &quot;Moesha&quot;. Bryant met the show&#x27;s star, Brandy, earlier in the year at a Nike All-Star basketball game; a couple of months later, in May 1996, he was Brandy&#x27;s date to her Hollywood High School senior prom. That year, Bryant guest starred as himself on an episode of &quot;Arli$$&quot; (episode: &quot;What About the Fans?&quot;) and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; (episode: &quot;Kid-Napped&quot;). In 1997, Bryant appeared on an episode of &quot;Hang Time&quot;, followed by a guest appearance on the Nickelodeon sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; (1998). He was also the first choice for the role of Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;He Got Game&quot;, but turned down the role, saying &quot;this summer is too big for me.&quot;

Bryant was the subject of Spike Lee&#x27;s 2009 documentary film &quot;Kobe Doin&#x27; Work&quot;, which chronicled Bryant during the 2007–08 NBA season.

In 2018, Bryant became the first African-American to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, and the first former professional athlete to be nominated for and win an Academy Award in any category, for his film &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;. Despite winning the Oscar, he was denied membership into the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences due to his past sexual abuse case and their new set of standards of conduct within the recent MeToo movement. The film also won the Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject and a Sports Emmy Award. The film was produced by Bryant&#x27;s production company, Granity Studios. In addition to future animation projects, Bryant had been in talks with animator veteran Bruce Smith for the last six months before his death about starting his own animation studio.

Beginning in 2018, Bryant wrote, produced and hosted the television series &quot;Detail&quot;, which aired for multiple seasons on ESPN and ESPN+. It featured his insights into the game of basketball and in-depth analyzes of games and individual players. Bryant also appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Ridiculousness&quot; in 2019.

====Filmography====
=== Philanthropy ===
Bryant was the official ambassador for After-School All-Stars (ASAS), an American non-profit organization that provides comprehensive after-school programs to children in 13 US cities. Bryant also started the Kobe Bryant China Fund which partnered with the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, a charity backed by the Chinese government. The Kobe Bryant China Fund raises money within China earmarked for education and health programs. On November 4, 2010, Bryant appeared alongside Zach Braff at the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; launch event at the Santa Monica Airport, where they presented a $1 million check to the Call of Duty Endowment, an Activision-founded nonprofit organization that helps veterans transition to civilian careers after their military service has ended.

Bryant and his wife founded the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation (KVBFF). Its goals are &quot;helping young people in need, encouraging the development of physical and social skills through sports and assisting the homeless.&quot; Bryant spoke of the injustice aimed at homeless people who are blamed for their situation, saying that homelessness should not be ignored or made a low priority. Bryant said he wanted more out of life than just a successful basketball career.

Bryant and his wife were also founding donors of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, with Bryant also donating his uniform that he wore in the 2008 NBA Finals, the year Bryant was named the league MVP. During his lifetime, Bryant granted over 200 requests for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

=== Business ventures ===
Bryant established Kobe Inc. to own and grow brands in the sports industry. The initial investment was a 10% stake in the Bodyarmor SuperDrink company for $6 million in March 2014. The headquarters are in Newport Beach, California. With The Coca-Cola Company purchasing a minority stake in the company in August 2018, the valuation of Bryant&#x27;s stake rose to approximately $200 million.

In 2013, Bryant launched a production company called Granity Studios, which developed different media, ranging from films to television shows and novels.

On August 22, 2016, Bryant and his business partner Jeff Stibel launched Bryant-Stibel, a venture capital firm focused on different businesses including media, data, gaming, and technology, with $100 million in funding. In 2018, Bryant and Sports Academy launched Mamba Sports Academy, a joint athletic-training business venture. The academy established locations in Thousand Oaks and Redondo Beach, California.

=== Books ===
On October 23, 2018, Bryant&#x27;s book &quot;The Mamba Mentality: How I Play&quot;, with photographs and afterword by Andrew D. Bernstein, an introduction by Phil Jackson, and a foreword by Pau Gasol, was published by MCD / Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The book looks back on his career with photos and his reflections.

At the time of his death, Bryant was working with Brazilian author Paulo Coelho on a children&#x27;s book aimed at inspiring underprivileged children. After Bryant&#x27;s death, Coelho deleted the draft, saying in an interview that &quot;it didn&#x27;t make any sense to publish without him.&quot; He did not say how many pages had been written or whether the book had a title.

Bryant also co-wrote/produced several young adult novels through Granity Studios: &quot;The Wizenard Series: Training Camp&quot;, &quot;Legacy and the Queen&quot;, and &quot;Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof&quot;. A fourth novel, &quot;The Wizenard Series: Season One&quot;, was released posthumously in March 2020. &quot;The Wizarenard Series: Season One&quot; topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; middle-grade hardcover list.

At 9:06a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six family friends including John Altobelli, and the pilot, Ara Zobayan. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County for a basketball game at Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.

Due to light rain and fog that morning, the Los Angeles Police Department helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded. The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above Glendale, California, due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30 a.m., Zobayan contacted the Hollywood Burbank Airport&#x27;s control tower, notifying the tower of the situation, and was told he was &quot;flying too low&quot; to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40 a.m., the helicopter climbed rapidly from , flying at .

At 9:45 a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain in Calabasas, about northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and began burning. Bryant, his daughter, and the other seven occupants were all killed on impact. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a helicopter struggling before crashing.

=== Investigations ===
On January 28, Bryant&#x27;s identity was officially confirmed using fingerprints. The following day, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner stated that the official cause of death for him and the eight others on the helicopter was blunt force trauma.

The Federal Aviation Administration, National Transportation Safety Board, and the FBI launched investigations into the crash. 
The cause of the crash was hard to investigate, as the helicopter was not equipped with a black box. Over a year after the crash, on February 9, 2021, the NTSB declared that pilot Ara Zobayan probably became disoriented after flying into thick clouds. The five board members also said Zobayan, who also died in the crash, ignored his training and violated federal regulations during the 40-minute flight.

On February 28, 2023, Vanessa Bryant was awarded a $28.85 million settlement from Los Angeles County to conclude legal proceedings over graphic photos of the aftermath of the helicopter crash that were shared without the permission of the family. The figure includes the $15 million she was awarded from L.A. County in a 2022 civil trial, with &quot;additional funds to settle potential claims from her daughters&quot;—Natalia, 20, Bianka, 6, and Capri, 3. Chris Chester, a co-plaintiff who lost his 45-year-old wife and 13-year-old daughter in the crash, settled for $19.95 million.

=== Tributes and funeral services ===
On February 7, Bryant and his daughter were buried in a private funeral in Pacific View Memorial Park in the Corona del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach, California. A public memorial service was held on February 24 (2/24, marking both Kobe&#x27;s and Gianna&#x27;s jersey numbers) at Staples Center (later Crypto.com Arena) with Jimmy Kimmel hosting. Speakers at the service included Vanessa, Jordan, and O&#x27;Neal, along with Phoenix Mercury guard Diana Taurasi and Geno Auriemma, Taurasi&#x27;s coach at Connecticut, where Gianna had been aspiring to play.
The NBA had postponed the Lakers&#x27; game against the Clippers just two days after the accident on January 28—the first time an NBA game was postponed for any reason since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing led to the postponement of a Celtics game. On January 30, the first game at Staples Center after the crash was played between the Clippers and the Sacramento Kings; the Clippers honored Bryant before the game, with Southern California native Paul George narrating a video tribute to Bryant. The next day, the Lakers played their first game after the crash against the Trail Blazers. Ahead of the game, the Lakers paid tribute to Bryant and all who lost their lives in the crash with a ceremony held just before tip-off, with Usher singing &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; and Boyz II Men singing the national anthem, while Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth reunited to perform &quot;See You Again&quot;—originally their tribute to Paul Walker after his death while filming &quot;Furious 7&quot;—at halftime. James also delivered a speech to the crowd before the game, and every player in the Lakers starting lineup was announced with Bryant&#x27;s name. The game was the second-most-watched in ESPN history, averaging 4.41 million viewers. The first ever head-to-head meeting between Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Yao Ming in 2003 was the only one with more viewers.

Also, beginning with the Spurs and the Raptors in their game in San Antonio on the day of the crash, teams paid tribute to Bryant at the start of their games with intentional on-court violations referring to his uniform numbers on their first possession—either a 24-second shot clock or an 8-second backcourt violation. On February 15, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that the All-Star Game MVP Award would be renamed to the NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player Award in Bryant&#x27;s honor. In May 2020, the Mamba Sports Academy was renamed to Sports Academy out of respect for Bryant.

The 62nd Annual Grammy Awards went ahead as scheduled at Staples Center on the day of the crash, but included tributes by multiple artists and groups, including host Alicia Keys opening the show with a tribute speech in which she called Staples Center &quot;the house that Kobe Bryant built&quot; and joining Boyz II Men to sing &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday&quot;.

Bryant also appeared at the start of the In Memoriam segment of the 92nd Academy Awards following his Oscar in 2018 for &quot;Dear Basketball&quot;, and Spike Lee wore a suit in tribute to him at the ceremony. He was not included in the montages at the 2020 VMAs and Emmys, held later in the year. Fans were upset at the omission, especially as actors Naya Rivera and Chadwick Boseman had been featured prominently in both; after Rivera and Boseman&#x27;s unexpected deaths in July and August 2020 respectively, the three young black celebrities were popularly compared.

The 2020 Pro Bowl was also played at Camping World Stadium in Orlando on the day of the crash, and before kickoff, NFC players who learned of Bryant&#x27;s death conducted a prayer led by Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, while various on-field and PA tributes were made during the game.

In the 2020 WNBA draft, Gianna Bryant, Alyssa Altobelli, and Payton Chester were made honorary draft picks.

After the Lakers beat the Miami Heat in Game 6 of the 2020 NBA Finals to clinch the franchise&#x27;s 17th NBA championship, rapper, Lakers fan and Long Beach native Snoop Dogg paid homage to Bryant and the Lakers with a full forearm tattoo. Bryant was posthumously inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021, with Vanessa delivering the acceptance speech on Bryant&#x27;s behalf.

== Legacy ==
Bryant was called &quot;one of the greatest players in the history of our game&quot; by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Bryant had &quot;one of the most decorated careers in the history of the sport.&quot; Reuters called him &quot;arguably the best player of his generation&quot;, while both &quot;Sporting News&quot; and TNT named him their NBA player of the decade for the 2000s. In 2008 and again in 2016, ESPN ranked Bryant the second-greatest shooting guard of all time after Jordan. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and they named Bryant as the 10th-greatest player in NBA history and the second-highest shooting guard on the list, behind only Jordan. Many peer players—including Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, and Derrick Rose—called Bryant their generation&#x27;s version of Jordan. &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot; described Bryant as &quot;maybe the greatest Laker in the organization&#x27;s history.&quot; He was the Lakers&#x27; all-time leading scorer, and his five titles are tied for the most in franchise history. Both numbers Bryant wore during his career, 8 and 24, were retired by the Lakers on December 18, 2017. In his first year of eligibility, Bryant was named a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, weeks after his death, before being elected a couple of months later in April 2020. His formal induction was delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Bryant was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. The team was honored during the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland, with Bryant receiving one of the loudest cheers of the night.

With career averages of 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game, Bryant was considered one of the most complete players in NBA history. He is the fourth-leading scorer in league history with 33,643 points. Bryant was the first player in NBA history to have at least 30,000 career points and 6,000 career assists, and was one of only four players with 25,000 points, 6,000 rebounds, and 6,000 assists. He led the NBA in scoring during the and seasons. Bryant&#x27;s 81-point performance against Toronto in 2006 was the second-highest in NBA history, behind only Chamberlain&#x27;s 100. Bryant scored at least 50 points 24 times in his career, which is third in league history behind Jordan (31) and Chamberlain (118); six times Bryant scored at least 60. He was just the third player in NBA history to average 40 points in a calendar month, which Bryant accomplished four times. He was voted the league MVP in 2008 and led his team to the 2008 NBA Finals as the first seed in the Western Conference. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bryant won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. men&#x27;s basketball team, occasionally referred to as &quot;The Redeem Team.&quot; He won another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Bryant led the Lakers to two more championships in 2009 and 2010, winning the Finals MVP award on both occasions.

Bryant was an 18-time All-Star, which ranks second behind only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s and LeBron James&#x27; 19. Bryant was chosen a then-record 18 straight times, each time as a starter. On four occasions (2003, 2011, 2013, 2016), he was the leading vote-getter. Bryant was named the All-Star MVP four times, a record he shares with Bob Pettit. Bryant was selected to the All-NBA Team on 15 occasions, tied for the most with Abdul-Jabbar and Tim Duncan, and his 11 first-team honors are tied for the second-most with Karl Malone. Bryant was also a 12-time All-Defensive Team selection, trailing only Duncan&#x27;s 15, and Bryant was named to the All-Defensive First Team nine times, tied with Jordan, Garnett, and Gary Payton for the most all time. He was the first guard to play 20 seasons in the NBA. Bryant also won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 1997 and was its youngest winner. In his career, Bryant scored 40-plus points in 121 games, and he recorded a triple-double 21 times.

During the 2020 NBA playoffs, the Lakers&#x27; players wore &#x27;Black Mamba&#x27; jerseys in honor of Bryant. Designed by Bryant himself, the black jersey features a snakeskin pattern with yellow accents and 16 stars representing the team&#x27;s 16 championships at the time. In a Game 2 victory over the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals, Anthony Davis made a buzzer-beating three-pointer and yelled Bryant&#x27;s name, while the team was wearing the &#x27;Black Mamba&#x27; jerseys. Following a Game 2 victory in the 2020 NBA Finals, LeBron James was asked about the jerseys and had this to say: &quot;It&#x27;s always special to represent someone that meant so much, not only to the game but also to the Lakers organization for 20-plus years. For us to honor him, being on the floor, this is what it&#x27;s all about.&quot;

On January 26, 2022, coinciding with the second anniversary of his death and the helicopter crash, a statue of Bryant and his daughter Gianna was placed at the site where the crash occurred. Later in February, the NBA redesigned the All-Star Game MVP trophy as part of the major redesign of the All-Star Weekend trophies in celebration of the league&#x27;s 75th anniversary season.

On August 24, 2023, the Lakers stated that Bryant&#x27;s statue outside of the Crypto.com Arena would be revealed on February 8, 2024, to honor his two numbers with the Lakers, 8 and 24, and 2 for the number of his daughter Gianna. The inspiration for the statue, based on an image of Bryant after his 81-point game, pointing a finger toward the sky, was requested by Bryant himself before his death.

In February 2025, Donald Trump announced that Bryant would get a statue in the proposed National Garden of American Heroes.

<doc id="246186" wikidata="Q3128" url="?curid=246186" title="Graham Hill">
<text>Norman Graham Hill (15 February 1929 – 29 November 1975) was a British racing driver, rower and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Nicknamed &quot;Mr. Monaco&quot;, Hill won two Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles and—at the time of his retirement—held the record for most podium finishes (36); he won 14 Grands Prix across 18 seasons. In American open-wheel racing, Hill won the Indianapolis 500 in 1966 with Mecom. Upon winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Matra, Hill became the first—and to this date, only—driver to complete the Triple Crown of Motorsport.

Born and raised in London, Hill studied engineering before completing national service in the Royal Navy. He was a member of London Rowing Club from 1952 to 1954, contesting twenty finals and stroking the London crew in the Grand Challenge Cup. He made his racing debut in Formula Three aged 25. He initially joined Lotus in Formula One as a mechanic, before earning a driving debut with the team at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix and securing a full-time contract. After non-classified championship finishes in and with Lotus, Hill moved to BRM in , scoring his maiden podium at the . BRM fielded the competitive P57 in , with Hill taking his maiden victory at the season-opening and winning three further Grands Prix as he secured his maiden title, beating career rival Jim Clark and Bruce McLaren. He finished runner-up to Clark the following season, before losing the title by one point to John Surtees. Hill took multiple wins in as he finished runner-up to Clark once more in the standings. After a winless campaign, Hill returned to Lotus to partner Clark.

Helping develop the Lotus 49 for the new Cosworth DFV engines, Hill struggled with reliability throughout , with podiums in Monaco and the United States. Clark was killed after their 1–2 finish at the season opener in , leaving Hill in a close title battle with Jackie Stewart, which Hill won at the final race of the season. In , Hill became a five-time winner of the Monaco Grand Prix, a record he held for 24 years. During the , Hill was seriously injured in a crash, breaking both of his legs and ending his season prematurely. After recovering from his injuries, he returned as a privateer in before competing with Brabham for two further seasons, where he won the non-championship BRDC International Trophy in 1971. Hill founded and competed for Embassy Hill from to , retiring from motor racing after the to focus on team ownership and supporting his protégé Tony Brise. In addition to his two championships, Hill achieved 14 race wins, 13 pole positions, 10 fastest laps and 38 podiums in Formula One.

Outside Formula One, Hill entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans 10 times between and , winning the latter alongside Henri Pescarolo in the Matra-Simca MS670. He also entered the Indianapolis 500 three times from 1966 to 1968, winning the Borg-Warner Trophy at his first attempt. Throughout his early years, Hill also competed in the British Saloon Car Championship, topping his class in 1963, and entered six seasons of the Tasman Series, finishing runner-up to Stewart in 1966. In November 1975, Hill and five other Embassy Hill executives, including Brise, were killed when the Piper PA-23 Aztec aircraft Hill was piloting crashed in low-visibility conditions in north London whilst returning from a test session for the Hill GH2 at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Embassy Hill subsequently shut down ahead of the season. Hill&#x27;s son Damon went on to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in , becoming the first father-and-son World Drivers&#x27; Champions. Hill was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1990.

==Early life==
Hill was born in Hampstead, London, one of two sons of stockbroker Norman Herbert Devereux Hill, of Belsize Park, and his wife Constance Mary, née Philp. He attended Hendon Technical College and joined Smiths Instruments as an apprentice engineer. He was conscripted into the Royal Navy and served as an Engine Room Artificer (ERA) on the light cruiser HMS &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, rising to the rank of petty officer. After leaving the navy he rejoined Smiths Instruments.

==Racing career==

Hill did not pass his driving test until he was 24 years old, and he himself described his first car as &quot;A wreck. A budding racing driver should own such a car, as it teaches delicacy, poise and anticipation, mostly the latter I think!&quot; He had been interested in motorcycles but in 1954 he saw an advertisement for the Universal Motor Racing Club at Brands Hatch offering laps for five shillings. He made his debut in a Cooper 500 Formula 3 car and was committed to racing thereafter. Hill joined Team Lotus as a mechanic soon after but quickly talked his way into the cockpit. The Lotus presence in Formula One allowed him to make his debut at the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix, retiring with a halfshaft failure.

In 1960, Hill joined BRM, he won also in that year on 8 May 1960 the Targa Florio in the class Sports 1600 together with a German driver Edgar Barth in a Porsche 718, and won the world championship with BRM in 1962. He was known for his race preparation, keeping records of the settings on his car and working long hours with his mechanics. Hill was also part of the so-called &#x27;British invasion&#x27; of drivers and cars in the Indianapolis 500 during the mid-1960s, triumphing there in 1966 in a Lola-Ford.

At the same time, Hill along with his F1 contemporaries competed in the British Saloon Car Championship, scoring several outright wins. He achieved a best finish of sixth overall in 1961 driving a Jaguar Mark 2.

In 1967, back at Lotus, Hill helped to develop the Lotus 49 with the new Cosworth-V8 engine. It fell to Hill to perform the initial testing of the new car and its engine. After the first shakedown run, Hill quipped &quot;Well, it&#x27;s got some poke! Not a bad old tool.&quot; After teammates Jim Clark and Mike Spence were killed in early 1968, Hill led the team, and won his second world championship in 1968. The Lotus had a reputation of being very fragile and dangerous at that time, especially with the new aerodynamic aids which caused similar crashes of Hill and Jochen Rindt at the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix. A crash at the 1969 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen broke both his legs and interrupted his career. Typically, when asked soon after the crash if he wanted to pass on a message to his wife, Hill replied &quot;Just tell her that I won&#x27;t be dancing for two weeks.&quot;

Upon recovery Hill continued to race in F1 for several more years, but never again with the same level of success. Colin Chapman, believing Hill was a spent force, placed him in Rob Walker&#x27;s team for 1970, sweetening the deal with one of the brand-new Lotus 72 cars. Although Hill scored points in 1970 he started the season far from fully fit and the 72 was not fully developed until late in the season. Hill moved to Brabham for 1971–2; his last win in Formula One was in the non-Championship International Trophy at Silverstone in 1971 with the &quot;lobster claw&quot; Brabham. The team was in flux after the retirements of Sir Jack Brabham and then Ron Tauranac&#x27;s sale to Bernie Ecclestone; Hill did not settle there.

Hill was known during the latter part of his career for his wit and became a popular personality – he was a regular guest on television and wrote a notably frank and witty autobiography, &quot;Life at the Limit&quot;, when recovering from his 1969 accident. A second autobiography, which covered his career up until his retirement from racing simply called &quot;Graham&quot; was published posthumously in 1976. A staunch campaigner for road safety, Hill presented a series for Thames Television entitled &quot;Advanced Driving with Graham Hill&quot; comprising six 30-minute programmes broadcast weekly in June and July 1974. A book accompanying the series giving advice on safer and responsible driving was co-written by him. Hill was also irreverently immortalized on a Monty Python episode (&quot;It&#x27;s the Arts (or: Intermission)&quot; sketch called &quot;Historical Impersonations&quot;), in which a Gumby appears asking to &quot;see John the Baptist&#x27;s impersonation of Graham Hill.&quot; The head of St. John the Baptist appears (with a stuck-on moustache in Hill&#x27;s style) on a silver platter, which runs around the floor making putt-putt noises of a race car engine.
Hill was involved with four films between 1966 and 1974, including appearances in &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;Caravan to Vaccarès&quot;, in which he appeared as a helicopter pilot. During a Christmas Eve 1970 special of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; Hill played against Raymond Baxter on an early computer racing game, with data centre workers Anne Norie and Margaret Watson manning the terminals for the game.

Although Hill had concentrated on F1 he also maintained a presence in sports car racing throughout his career (including two runs in the Rover-BRM gas turbine car at Le Mans). As his F1 career drew to a close he became part of the Matra sports car team, taking a victory in the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans with Henri Pescarolo. This victory completed the so-called Triple Crown of Motorsport which is alternatively defined as winning either:
* the Indianapolis 500 (won by Hill in 1966), the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1972) and the Monaco Grand Prix (1963–65, 1968, 1969), or
* the Indianapolis 500, the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Formula One World Championship (1962, 1968).
Using either definition, Hill is still the only person ever to have accomplished this feat.

Hill set up his own team in 1973: Embassy Hill with sponsorship from Imperial Tobacco. The team used chassis from Shadow and Lola before evolving the Lola into its own design in 1975. After failing to qualify for the 1975 Monaco Grand Prix, where he had won five times, Hill retired from driving to concentrate on running the team and supporting his protege Tony Brise.

Along with Stirling Moss, Hill put his name to and supported the Grand Prix Midget Championship, which started in 1975, with the aim of bringing low cost motor sport to people who wanted to try a new career.

Hill&#x27;s record of 176 Grand Prix starts remained in place for over a decade until being equalled by Jacques Laffite.

==Family==
Hill married Bette in 1955; because Hill had spent all his money on his racing career, she paid for the wedding. They had two daughters, Brigitte and Samantha, and a son, Damon, who himself later became Formula One World Champion – the first son of a former world champion to emulate his father.

The family lived in Mill Hill during the 1960s. The house now features an English Heritage blue plaque. During the early 1970s, Hill moved to Lyndhurst House in Shenley in Hertfordshire. The house is now owned by musician Jeff Wayne. Well known for throwing extravagant parties at his houses to which most of the Grand Prix paddock and other famous guests attended, Hill was universally popular.

==Rowing==

Before taking up motor racing, Hill spent several years actively involved in rowing. Initially, he rowed at Southsea Rowing Club, while stationed in Portsmouth with the Royal Navy and at Auriol Rowing Club in Hammersmith. He met his future wife Bette at a Boxing Day party at Auriol and, while courting her, he also coached her clubmates at Stuart Ladies&#x27; Rowing Club on the River Lea.

In 1952 he joined London Rowing Club, then as now one of the largest and most successful clubs in Great Britain. From 1952 to 1954, Hill rowed in twenty finals with London, usually as stroke of the crew, eight of which resulted in wins. He also stroked the London eight in the highly prestigious Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta, losing a semi-final to Union Sportif Metropolitaine des Transports, France by a length.

Through his racing career he continued to support rowing and London. In 1968 when the club began a financial appeal to modernise its clubhouse, Hill launched proceedings by driving an old Morris Oxford, which had been obtained for £5, head-on into a boundary wall. Hill made three runs to reduce the wall to rubble, and the car was subsequently sold for £15.

Hill felt that the experience gained in rowing helped him in his motor-racing. He wrote in his autobiography:

&quot;I really enjoyed my rowing. It really taught me a lot about myself, and I also think it is a great character-building sport...The self discipline required for rowing and the &#x27;never say die&#x27; attitude obviously helped me through the difficult years that lay ahead.&quot;

Hill adopted the colours and cap design of London Rowing Club for his racing helmet – dark blue with white oar-shaped tabs. His son Damon and grandson Josh later adopted the same colours with permission from the club.

==Death==
Hill died on 29 November 1975 at the age of 46 when his Piper PA-23 Aztec twin-engine light aircraft crashed near Arkley in the London Borough of Barnet, while on a night approach to Elstree Airfield in thick fog. On board with him were five other members of the Embassy Hill team who all died: manager Ray Brimble, mechanics Tony Alcock and Terry Richards, driver Tony Brise, and designer Andy Smallman. The party was returning from a car-testing session at the Paul Ricard Circuit in southern France.

The subsequent investigation revealed that Hill&#x27;s aircraft, originally registered in the US as had been removed from the FAA register and at the time of the accident was &quot;unregistered and stateless&quot;, despite still displaying its original markings. Furthermore, Hill&#x27;s American FAA pilot certification had expired, as had his instrument rating. His UK IMC rating, which would have permitted him to fly in the weather conditions that prevailed at the time, was also out of date and invalid. Hill was effectively uninsured. The investigation into the crash was ultimately inconclusive, but pilot error was deemed the most likely explanation.

Hill&#x27;s funeral was held at St Albans Abbey, and he is buried at St Botolph&#x27;s graveyard, Shenleybury. The church has since been deconsecrated so the tomb now sits in a private garden.

==Legacy==
After his death, Silverstone village, home to the track of the same name, named a road, Graham Hill, after him and there is a &quot;Graham Hill Road&quot; on The Shires estate in nearby Towcester. Graham Hill Bend at Brands Hatch is also named in his honour. A blue plaque commemorates Hill at 32 Parkside, in Mill Hill, London NW7.

In Bourne, Lincolnshire, where Hill&#x27;s former team BRM is based, a road called Graham Hill Way is named in his honour. Also a nursery school in Lusevera, Italy, was named in his honour.

*Hill failed to qualify the innovative John Crosthwaite (who had worked with Hill at Team Lotus) designed &#x27;roller skate&#x27; car for the 1963 Indianapolis 500 race after crashing in practice. Hill, who had been commuting weekly due to other commitments in Europe, would not wait in the USA while the car was repaired and risk not qualifying or qualifying badly.
*Hill&#x27;s 1966 victory marked the first win by a rookie driver since George Souders&#x27; 1927 win and the last until Juan Pablo Montoya&#x27;s visit to Victory Lane in 2000 (Montoya has also emulated Hill&#x27;s feat of winning both the Indianapolis 500 and the Monaco Grand Prix).
*Hill entered the 1969 Indianapolis 500, but his car (Lotus-Ford Chassis 64/2) was withdrawn during practice along with those of Mario Andretti and Jochen Rindt due to delays rectifying problems associated with hub failure on Andretti&#x27;s car.

==Honours and awards==
Hill&#x27;s easy wit and charm helped him become a television personality, notably on the BBC show &quot;Call My Bluff&quot; with Patrick Campbell and Frank Muir. For a number of years in the early 1970s he appeared as one half of a double act, with Jackie Stewart, as an insert within the &quot;BBC Sports Personality of the Year&quot; show. In June 1975 he appeared alongside his son, Damon Hill, on the popular television programme &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;. His appearance was later rebroadcast as part of the twentieth anniversary celebrations of the programme in January 1995, with Damon presenting a new segment at the end.

Hill was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1968 Birthday Honours for services to motor racing. In 1990, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.

A one-off BBC Four documentary called &quot;Graham Hill: Driven&quot; was first broadcast on 26 May 2008.

<doc id="246188" wikidata="Q318754" url="?curid=246188" title="Summation by parts">
<text>In mathematics, summation by parts transforms the summation of products of sequences into other summations, often simplifying the computation or (especially) estimation of certain types of sums. It is also called Abel&#x27;s lemma or Abel transformation, named after Niels Henrik Abel who introduced it in 1826.

==Statement==
Suppose formula_1 and formula_2 are two sequences. Then,
:formula_3

Using the forward difference operator formula_4, it can be stated more succinctly as

:formula_5

Summation by parts is an analogue to integration by parts:
:formula_6

or to Abel&#x27;s summation formula:
:formula_7

An alternative statement is
:formula_8
which is analogous to the integration by parts formula for semimartingales.

Although applications almost always deal with convergence of sequences, the statement is purely algebraic and will work in any field. It will also work when one sequence is in a vector space, and the other is in the relevant field of scalars.

==Newton series==
The formula is sometimes given in one of these - slightly different - forms

:formula_9

which represent a special case (formula_10) of the more general rule

:formula_11

both result from iterated application of the initial formula. The auxiliary quantities are Newton series:

:formula_12
and 
:formula_13
:formula_14

A particular (formula_15) result is the identity
:formula_16

Here, formula_17 is the binomial coefficient.

==Method==

For two given sequences formula_18 and formula_19, with formula_20, one wants to study the sum of the following series: formula_21

If we define formula_22 then for every formula_23 formula_24 and
formula_25
formula_26

Finally formula_27

This process, called an Abel transformation, can be used to prove several criteria of convergence for formula_28.

==Similarity with an integration by parts==

The formula for an integration by parts is formula_29.

Beside the boundary conditions, we notice that the first integral contains two multiplied functions, one which is integrated in the final integral (formula_30 becomes formula_31) and one which is differentiated (formula_32 becomes formula_33).

The process of the &quot;Abel transformation&quot; is similar, since one of the two initial sequences is summed (formula_34 becomes formula_35) and the other one is differenced (formula_36 becomes formula_37).

==Applications==

* It is used to prove Kronecker&#x27;s lemma, which in turn, is used to prove a version of the strong law of large numbers under variance constraints.
* It may be used to prove Nicomachus&#x27;s theorem that the sum of the first formula_38 cubes equals the square of the sum of the first formula_38 positive integers.
* Summation by parts is frequently used to prove Abel&#x27;s theorem and Dirichlet&#x27;s test.
* One can also use this technique to prove Abel&#x27;s test: If formula_40 is a convergent series, and formula_41 a bounded monotone sequence, then formula_42 converges.

Proof of Abel&#x27;s test. Summation by parts gives
formula_43
where &quot;a&quot; is the limit of formula_41. As formula_40 is convergent, formula_46 is bounded independently of formula_47, say by formula_48. As formula_49 go to zero, so go the first two terms. The third term goes to zero by the Cauchy criterion for formula_40. The remaining sum is bounded by
formula_51
by the monotonicity of formula_41, and also goes to zero as formula_53.

Using the same proof as above, one can show that if
# the partial sums formula_46 form a bounded sequence independently of formula_47;
# formula_56 (so that the sum formula_57 goes to zero as formula_47 goes to infinity) 
# formula_59
then formula_42 converges.

In both cases, the sum of the series satisfies:formula_61

== Summation-by-parts operators for high order finite difference methods ==
A summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference operator conventionally consists of a centered difference interior scheme and specific boundary stencils that mimics behaviors of the corresponding integration-by-parts formulation. The boundary conditions are usually imposed by the Simultaneous-Approximation-Term (SAT) technique. The combination of SBP-SAT is a powerful framework for boundary treatment. The method is preferred for well-proven stability for long-time simulation, and high order of accuracy.

<doc id="246206" wikidata="Q164727" url="?curid=246206" title="Psittacosis">
<text>Psittacosis—also known as parrot fever, and ornithosis—is a zoonotic infectious disease in humans caused by a bacterium called &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot; and contracted from infected parrots, such as macaws, cockatiels, and budgerigars, and from pigeons, sparrows, ducks, hens, gulls and many other species of birds. The incidence of infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in psittacine birds.

In certain contexts, the word is used when the disease is carried by any species of birds belonging to the family Psittacidae, whereas ornithosis is used when other birds carry the disease.

==In humans==

===Signs and symptoms===
In humans, after an incubation period of 5–19 days, the disease course ranges from asymptomatic to systemic illness with severe pneumonia. It presents chiefly as an atypical pneumonia. In the first week of psittacosis, the symptoms mimic typhoid fever, causing high fevers, joint pain, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, nose bleeds, and low level of white blood cells. Rose spots called Horder&#x27;s spots sometimes appear during this stage. These are pink, blanching maculopapular eruptions resembling the rose spots of typhoid fever. Spleen enlargement is common towards the end of the first week, after which psittacosis may develop into a serious lung infection. Diagnosis is indicated where respiratory infection occurs simultaneously with splenomegaly and/or epistaxis. Headache can be so severe that it suggests meningitis and some nuchal rigidity is not unusual. Towards the end of the first week, stupor or even coma can result in severe cases.

The second week is more akin to acute bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with continuous high fevers, headaches, cough, and dyspnea. X-rays at that stage show patchy infiltrates or a diffuse whiteout of lung fields.

Complications in the form of endocarditis, liver inflammation, inflammation of the heart&#x27;s muscle, joint inflammation, keratoconjunctivitis (occasionally extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the lacrimal gland/orbit), and neurologic complications (brain inflammation) may occasionally occur. Severe pneumonia requiring intensive-care support may also occur. Fatal cases have been reported (less than 1% of cases).

===Transmission route===
The &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot; bacterium that causes psittacosis can be transmitted by mouth-to-beak contact, or through the airborne inhalation of feather dust, dried faeces, or the respiratory secretions of infected birds. Person-to-person transmission is possible, but rare.

===Diagnosis===
Blood analysis usually shows a normal white cell count, but marked leukocytosis is occasionally apparent. Liver enzymes are abnormal in half of the patients, with mild elevation of aspartate transaminase. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein can be markedly elevated. Differential diagnosis must be made with typhus, typhoid, and atypical pneumonia by &quot;Mycoplasma, Legionella&quot;, or Q fever. Exposure history is paramount to diagnosis.
Diagnosis involves microbiological cultures from respiratory secretions of patients or serologically with a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers against &quot;C. psittaci&quot; in blood samples combined with the probable course of the disease. Typical inclusions called &quot;Leventhal-Cole-Lillie bodies&quot; can be seen within macrophages in BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) fluid. Culture of &quot;C. psittaci&quot; is hazardous and should only be carried out in biosafety laboratories.

===Treatment===
The infection is treated with antibiotics; tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are the choice for treating patients. Most people respond to oral therapy doxycycline, tetracycline hydrochloride, or chloramphenicol palmitate. For initial treatment of severely ill patients, doxycycline hyclate may be administered intravenously. Remission of symptoms is usually evident within 48–72 hours. However, relapse can occur, and treatment must continue for at least 10–14 days after fever subsides.

===Epidemiology===

Psittacosis was first reported in Europe in 1879.

In 1929, a highly publicized outbreak of psittacosis hit the United States. Although not the first report of psittacosis in the United States, it was the largest up to that time. It led to greater controls on the import of pet parrots. The aftermath of the outbreak and how it was handled led to the establishment of the National Institutes of Health.

From 2002 through 2009, 66 human cases of psittacosis were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most resulted from exposure to infected pet birds, usually cockatiels, parakeets, and macaws. Many more cases may occur that are not correctly diagnosed or reported.
Bird owners, pet shop employees, zookeepers, and veterinarians are at risk of the infection. Some outbreaks of psittacosis in poultry-processing plants have been reported.

==In birds==

In birds, &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot; infection is referred to as avian chlamydiosis. Infected birds shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, which can remain infectious for several months. Many strains remain quiescent in birds until activated under stress. Birds are excellent, highly mobile vectors for the distribution of chlamydial infection because they feed on, and have access to, the detritus of infected animals of all sorts.

=== Signs ===
&quot;C. psittaci&quot; in birds is often systemic and infections can be inapparent, severe, acute, or chronic with intermittent shedding. Signs in birds include &quot;inflamed eyes, difficulty in breathing, watery droppings, and green urates.&quot;

=== Diagnosis ===

Initial diagnosis may be by symptoms, but is usually confirmed by an antigen and antibody test. A polymerase chain reaction-based test is also available. Although any of these tests can confirm psittacosis, false negatives are possible, so a combination of clinical and laboratory tests is recommended before giving the bird a clean bill of health. 

=== Epidemiology ===
Infection is usually by the droppings of another infected bird, though it can also be transmitted by feathers and eggs, and is typically either inhaled or ingested.

&quot;C. psittaci&quot; strains in birds infect mucosal epithelial cells and macrophages of the respiratory tract. Septicaemia eventually develops and the bacteria become localized in epithelial cells and macrophages of most organs, conjunctiva, and gastrointestinal tract. It can also be passed in the eggs. Stress commonly triggers onset of severe symptoms, resulting in rapid deterioration and death. &quot;C. psittaci&quot; strains are similar in virulence, grow readily in cell culture, have 16S-rRNA genes that differ by &lt;0.8%, and belong to eight known serovars. All should be considered to be readily transmissible to humans.

&quot;C. psittaci&quot; serovar A is endemic among psittacine birds and has caused sporadic zoonotic disease in humans, other mammals, and tortoises. Serovar B is endemic among pigeons, has been isolated from turkeys, and has also been identified as the cause of abortion in a dairy herd. Serovars C and D are occupational hazards for slaughterhouse workers and for people in contact with birds. Serovar E isolates (known as Cal-10, MP, or MN) have been obtained from a variety of avian hosts worldwide, and although they were associated with the 1920s–1930s outbreak in humans, a specific reservoir for serovar E has not been identified. The M56 and WC serovars were isolated during outbreaks in mammals.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment is usually with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or tetracycline, and can be administered through drops in the water or injections. Many strains of &quot;C. psittaci&quot; are susceptible to bacteriophages.

==Use as a biological weapon==
Psittacosis was one of more than a dozen agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program.

==Notable casualties==
In 1930, during the 1929–1930 psittacosis pandemic, Lena Rose Pepperdine died of parrot fever. She was the first wife of George Pepperdine, the founder of Pepperdine University.

<text>In graph theory, a component of an undirected graph is a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph. The components of any graph partition its vertices into disjoint sets, and are the induced subgraphs of those sets. A graph that is itself connected has exactly one component, consisting of the whole graph. Components are sometimes called connected components.

The number of components in a given graph is an important graph invariant, and is closely related to invariants of matroids, topological spaces, and matrices. In random graphs, a frequently occurring phenomenon is the incidence of a giant component, one component that is significantly larger than the others; and of a percolation threshold, an edge probability above which a giant component exists and below which it does not.

The components of a graph can be constructed in linear time, and a special case of the problem, connected-component labeling, is a basic technique in image analysis. Dynamic connectivity algorithms maintain components as edges are inserted or deleted in a graph, in low time per change. In computational complexity theory, connected components have been used to study algorithms with limited space complexity, and sublinear time algorithms can accurately estimate the number of components.

==Definitions and examples==

A component of a given undirected graph may be defined as a connected subgraph that is not part of any larger connected subgraph. For instance, the graph shown in the first illustration has three components. Every vertex formula_1 of a graph belongs to one of the graph&#x27;s components, which may be found as the induced subgraph of the set of vertices reachable from Every graph is the disjoint union of its components. Additional examples include the following special cases:
*In an empty graph, each vertex forms a component with one vertex and zero edges. More generally, a component of this type is formed for every isolated vertex in any graph.
*In a connected graph, there is exactly one component: the whole graph.
*In a forest, every component is a tree.
*In a cluster graph, every component is a maximal clique. These graphs may be produced as the transitive closures of arbitrary undirected graphs, for which finding the transitive closure is an equivalent formulation of identifying the connected components.

Another definition of components involves the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation defined on the graph&#x27;s vertices.
In an undirected graph, a is &quot;reachable&quot; from a if there is a path from formula_2 or equivalently a walk (a path allowing repeated vertices and edges).
Reachability is an equivalence relation, since:
*It is reflexive: There is a trivial path of length zero from any vertex to itself.
*It is symmetric: If there is a path from formula_2 the same edges in the reverse order form a path from formula_1 
*It is transitive: If there is a path from formula_2 and a path from formula_1 the two paths may be concatenated together to form a walk from formula_2 
The equivalence classes of this relation partition the vertices of the graph into disjoint sets, subsets of vertices that are all reachable from each other, with no additional reachable pairs outside of any of these subsets. Each vertex belongs to exactly one equivalence class. The components are then the induced subgraphs formed by each of these equivalence classes. Alternatively, some sources define components as the sets of vertices rather than as the subgraphs they induce.

Similar definitions involving equivalence classes have been used to defined components for other forms of graph connectivity, including the weak components and strongly connected components of directed graphs and the biconnected components of undirected graphs.

==Number of components==
The number of components of a given finite graph can be used to count the number of edges in its spanning forests: In a graph with formula_8 vertices and formula_9 components, every spanning forest will have exactly formula_10 edges. This number formula_10 is the matroid-theoretic rank of the graph, and the rank of its graphic matroid. The rank of the dual cographic matroid equals the circuit rank of the graph, the minimum number of edges that must be removed from the graph to break all its cycles. In a graph with formula_12 edges, formula_8 vertices and formula_9 components, the circuit rank is 

A graph can be interpreted as a topological space in multiple ways, for instance by placing its vertices as points in general position in three-dimensional Euclidean space and representing its edges as line segments between those points. The components of a graph can be generalized through these interpretations as the topological connected components of the corresponding space; these are equivalence classes of points that cannot be separated by pairs of disjoint closed sets. Just as the number of connected components of a topological space is an important topological invariant, the zeroth Betti number, the number of components of a graph is an important graph invariant, and in topological graph theory it can be interpreted as the zeroth Betti number of the graph.

The number of components arises in other ways in graph theory as well. In algebraic graph theory it equals the multiplicity of 0 as an eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of a finite graph. It is also the index of the first nonzero coefficient of the chromatic polynomial of the graph, and the chromatic polynomial of the whole graph can be obtained as the product of the polynomials of its components. Numbers of components play a key role in the Tutte theorem characterizing finite graphs that have perfect matchings and the associated Tutte–Berge formula for the size of a maximum matching, and in the definition of graph toughness.

==Algorithms==
It is straightforward to compute the components of a finite graph in linear time (in terms of the numbers of the vertices and edges of the graph) using either breadth-first search or depth-first search. In either case, a search that begins at some particular will find the entire component (and no more) before returning. All components of a graph can be found by looping through its vertices, starting a new breadth-first or depth-first search whenever the loop reaches a vertex that has not already been included in a previously found component. describe essentially this algorithm, and state that it was already &quot;well known&quot;.

Connected-component labeling, a basic technique in computer image analysis, involves the construction of a graph from the image and component analysis on the graph.
The vertices are the subset of the pixels of the image, chosen as being of interest or as likely to be part of depicted objects. Edges connect adjacent pixels, with adjacency defined either orthogonally according to the Von Neumann neighborhood, or both orthogonally and diagonally according to the Moore neighborhood. Identifying the connected components of this graph allows additional processing to find more structure in those parts of the image or identify what kind of object is depicted. Researchers have developed component-finding algorithms specialized for this type of graph, allowing it to be processed in pixel order rather than in the more scattered order that would be generated by breadth-first or depth-first searching. This can be useful in situations where sequential access to the pixels is more efficient than random access, either because the image is represented in a hierarchical way that does not permit fast random access or because sequential access produces better memory access patterns.

There are also efficient algorithms to dynamically track the components of a graph as vertices and edges are added, by using a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of the partition of the vertices into equivalence classes, replacing any two classes by their union when an edge connecting them is added. These algorithms take amortized time formula_15 per operation, where adding vertices and edges and determining the component in which a vertex falls are both operations, and formula_16 is a very slowly growing inverse of the very quickly growing Ackermann function. One application of this sort of incremental connectivity algorithm is in Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm for minimum spanning trees, which adds edges to a graph in sorted order by length and includes an edge in the minimum spanning tree only when it connects two different components of the previously-added subgraph. When both edge insertions and edge deletions are allowed, dynamic connectivity algorithms can still maintain the same information, in amortized time formula_17 per change and time formula_18 per connectivity query, or in near-logarithmic randomized expected time.

Components of graphs have been used in computational complexity theory to study the power of Turing machines that have a working memory limited to a logarithmic number of bits, with the much larger input accessible only through read access rather than being modifiable. The problems that can be solved by machines limited in this way define the complexity class L. It was unclear for many years whether connected components could be found in this model, when formalized as a decision problem of testing whether two vertices belong to the same component, and in 1982 a related complexity class, SL, was defined to include this connectivity problem and any other problem equivalent to it under logarithmic-space reductions. It was finally proven in 2008 that this connectivity problem can be solved in logarithmic space, and therefore that 

In a graph represented as an adjacency list, with random access to its vertices, it is possible to estimate the number of connected components, with constant probability of obtaining additive (absolute) error at most formula_19, in sublinear time formula_20.

== In random graphs ==
In random graphs the sizes of components are given by a random variable, which, in turn, depends on the specific model of how random graphs are chosen. 
In the formula_21 version of the Erdős–Rényi–Gilbert model, a graph on formula_8 vertices is generated by choosing randomly and independently for each pair of vertices whether to include an edge connecting that pair, with of including an edge and probability formula_23 of leaving those two vertices without an edge connecting them. The connectivity of this model depends and there are three different ranges with very different behavior from each other. In the analysis below, all outcomes occur with high probability, meaning that the probability of the outcome is arbitrarily close to one for sufficiently large values The analysis depends on a parameter formula_24, a positive constant independent of formula_8 that can be arbitrarily close to zero.

;Subcritical formula_26
: In this range of formula_27, all components are simple and very small. The largest component has logarithmic size. The graph is a pseudoforest. Most of its components are trees: the number of vertices in components that have cycles grows more slowly than any unbounded function of the number of vertices. Every tree of fixed size occurs linearly many times.
;Critical formula_28
: The largest connected component has a number of vertices proportional to There may exist several other large components; however, the total number of vertices in non-tree components is again proportional to 
;Supercritical formula_29
: There is a single giant component containing a linear number of vertices. For large values of formula_27 its size approaches the whole graph: formula_31 where formula_32 is the positive solution to the equation The remaining components are small, with logarithmic size.
In the same model of random graphs, there will exist multiple connected components with high probability for values of formula_27 below a significantly higher threshold, and a single connected component for values above the threshold, This phenomenon is closely related to the coupon collector&#x27;s problem: in order to be connected, a random graph needs enough edges for each vertex to be incident to at least one edge. More precisely, if random edges are added one by one to a graph, then with high probability the first edge whose addition connects the whole graph touches the last isolated vertex.

For different models including the random subgraphs of grid graphs, the connected components are described by percolation theory. A key question in this theory is the existence of a percolation threshold, a critical probability above which a giant component (or infinite component) exists and below which it does not.

<doc id="246225" wikidata="Q1465419" url="?curid=246225" title="Music of Greece">
<text>The music of Greece is as diverse and celebrated as its history. Greek music separates into two parts: Greek traditional music and Byzantine music. These compositions have existed for millennia: they originated in the Byzantine period and Greek antiquity; there is a continuous development which appears in the language, the rhythm, the structure and the melody. Music is a significant aspect of Hellenic culture, both within Greece and in the diaspora.

==Greek musical history==
Greek musical history extends far back into ancient Greece, since music was a major part of ancient Greek theater. Later influences from the Roman Empire, Eastern Europe and the Byzantine Empire changed the form and style of Greek music. In the 19th century, opera composers, like Nikolaos Mantzaros (1795–1872), Spyridon Xyndas (1812–1896) and Spyridon Samaras (1861–1917) and symphonists, like Dimitris Lialios and Dionysios Rodotheatos revitalized Greek art music.

===Ancient Greece===

In ancient Greece, men usually performed choruses for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual reasons. Instruments included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument (like pandura), the kanonaki, the lyre, especially the special kind called a kithara.

Music was an important part of education in ancient Greece, and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created a flowering of development; Greek music theory included the Greek musical modes, eventually became the basis for Eastern and Western religious music and classical music.

===Roman era===

Due to Rome&#x27;s reverence for Greek culture, the Romans borrowed the Greek method of &#x27;enchiriadic notation&#x27; (marks which indicated the general shape of the tune but not the exact notes or rhythms) to record their music, if they used any notation at all.

===Byzantine era===

The tradition of eastern liturgical chant, encompassing the Greek-speaking world, developed in the Byzantine Empire from the establishment of its capital, Constantinople, in 330 until its fall in 1453. It is undeniably of composite origin, drawing on the artistic and technical productions of the classical Greek age, of Jewish religious music, and inspired by the monophonic vocal music that evolved in the early (Greek) Christian cities of Alexandria, Antioch and Ephesus (see also Early Christian music). In his lexicographical discussion of instruments, the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911) cited the lūrā (bowed lyra) as a typical instrument of the Byzantines along with the &quot;urghun&quot; (organ), &quot;shilyani&quot; (probably a type of harp or lyre), and the &quot;salandj&quot; (probably a bagpipe). Other instruments used in the folk Byzantine-era music, were kanonaki, oud, laouto, santouri and other instruments that are still played in post-Byzantine regions today.

===Ottoman era===
The Greeks were familiar, in this period that stretched from the 15th century to the time of Greek war of independence, with the traditional Greek folk music, elements of the Ottoman music, such as with surviving Byzantine music and more specifically, hymns: Church music. These genres have certainly reached a high degree of evolution. They were forms of a mono music that had many elements of ancient Greek origin but also, they had nothing to do with Western polyphonic music.
By the beginning of the 20th century, music-cafés (καφέ-σαντάν) were popular in cities like Constantinople and Smyrna, where small groups of musicians from Greece played. The bands were typically led by a female vocalist and included a violin. The improvised songs typically exclaimed &quot;amán amán&quot;, which led to the name &quot;amanédhes&quot; (αμανέδες &quot;amanédes&quot;, singular &quot;amanés&quot;) or &quot;café-aman&quot; (καφέ-αμάν). Greek musicians of this period included Marika Papagika, Rosa Eskenazi and Rita Abatzi. This period also brought in the Rebetiko movement, which had local Smyrniote, Ottoman and Byzantine influences.

===Folk music (dimotiká or demotic)===

Greek folk music traditions are said to derive from the music played by ancient Greeks. There are said to be two musical movements in Greek folk music (παραδοσιακή μουσική): Acritic songs and Klephtic songs. Akritic music comes from the 9th century &quot;akrites&quot;, or border guards of the Byzantine Empire. Following the end of the Byzantine period, klephtic music arose before the Greek Revolution, developed among the &quot;kleftes&quot;, warriors who fought against the Ottoman Empire. Klephtic music is monophonic and uses no harmonic accompaniment.

&quot;Dimotika tragoudia&quot; are only from the mainland and accompanied by clarinets, tambourines, laouto, violins and lyras, and include dance music like syrtó, kalamatianó, tsámiko and hasaposérviko, as well as vocal music like kléftiko. The lyrics are based on dimotiki (folk) poetry (usually by anonymous lyricist) and popular themes are love, marriage, humor, death, nature, water, sea, religious, about klephts, armatoloi, various war fighters or battles etc. Some notable instrumentalists include clarinet virtuosos like Petroloukas Chalkias, Giorgos Gevgelis and Yiannis Vassilopoulos, as well as laouto and fiddle players like Nikos Saragoudas, Vasilis Kostas and Giorgos Koros.

Greek folk music is found all throughout Greece, Cyprus, and several regions of Turkey, as well as among communities in countries like the United States, Canada and Australia. The island of Cyprus and several regions of Turkey are home to long-standing communities of Greeks in Turkey with their own unique styles of music.

====Nisiótika====

&quot;Nisiotika&quot; is a general term denoting folk songs from the Greek islands, especially the Aegean Islands. Among the most popular types of them is &quot;Ikariótiko tragoúdi&quot;, &quot;song from Ikaria&quot;.

=====Ikariótikos=====

&quot;Ikariótikos&quot; is a traditional type of dance, and also the name of its accompanying type of singing, originating in the Aegean island of Ikaria. At first it was a very slow dance, but today Ikariotikos is a very quick dance. Some specialists say that the traditional Ikariotikos was slow and the quick &quot;version&quot; of it is in fact Ballos. Music and dancing are major forms of entertainment in Ikaria. Throughout the year Ikarians host baptisms, weddings, parties and religious festivals where one can listen and dance to live traditional Ikarian Music.

=====Modern nisiótika=====
Singer Mariza Koch was largely responsible for the revival of interest in Nisiótika in the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1990s and 2000s, singers such as Yiannis Parios and Stella Konitopoulou helped this music gain occasional mainstream popularity.

====Cretan music====

The Cretan lyra is the dominant folk instrument on the island; it is a three-stringed bowed instrument similar to the Byzantine Lyra. It is often accompanied with laouto (which is similar to both an oud and a lute), guitar, violin and (Cretan) mandolin. Nikos Xylouris, Psarantonis (Antonis Xylouris), Thanassis Skordalos, Kostas Moundakis, Ross Daly, Nikos Zoidakis and Vasilis Skoulas are among the most renowned players of the lýra. The violin is used also in Cretan music. The most renowned player of the violin is the Antonis Martsakis which is also a dancer. Mandolin is also used in Cretan music. Loudovikos ton Anogeion (Λουδοβίκος των Ανωγείων) is a well-known mandolin player from Crete. The bass in that music coming from the laouto. Giannis Haroulis and Michalis Tzouganakis are notable artists of the instrument.

=====Cretan music in media=====
The Cretan music theme &quot;Zorba&#x27;s dance&quot; by Mikis Theodorakis (incorporating elements from the hasapiko dance) which appears in the Hollywood 1964 movie Zorba the Greek remains the best-known Greek song abroad.

==Classical music==

===Ionian school===

It was through the Ionian islands (which were under Venetian rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first school of modern Greek classical music (Heptanesian or Ionian school; Greek: Επτανησιακή Σχολή), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Spyridon Samaras, Dionysius Rodotheatos and Pavlos Carrer.

The Church music (Byzantine) of the islands is also different from the rest of Greece, with significant western and Catholic influences on the Orthodox rite.

===Greek national school===
Manolis Kalomiris (1883–1962) was the founder of the Greek national school of music. Born in Smyrna, he attended school in Constantinople and studied piano and composition in Vienna. His work drew influences also from the Greek folk music, poetry (he was an admirer of Kostis Palamas) and myth, aiming to combine the German Romanticism with Greek motives. In 1919 he founded the Hellenic Conservatory and in 1926 the National Conservatoire. Representatives are also Nikos Skalkottas, who drew his influences also from Greek folk tradition, Emilios Riadis and the conductor Dimitris Mitropoulos.

==Popular music==

===Greek operetta and early popular songs===

The Heptanesean kantádes (καντάδες &#x27;serenades&#x27;; sing.: καντάδα) are based on the popular Italian music of the early 19th century and became the forerunners of the Greek modern song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style.

The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια &#x27;theatrical revue songs&#x27;) in revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens&#x27; theatre scene. Notable composers of operettas or nocturnes were Spyridon Samaras, Kostas Giannidis, Spyridon Kaisaris, Dionysios Lavrangas, Nikos Hatziapostolou, while Theophrastos Sakellaridis&#x27; &quot;The Godson&quot; remains probably the most popular operetta. Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly dramatic forms of Art, they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include Orestis Makris, Kalouta sisters, Petros Epitropakis, Vasilis Avlonitis, Afroditi Laoutari, Rena Vlahopoulou, Eleni Papadaki, Aris Maliagros, Marika Nezer, Marika Krevata and others. Italian opera had also a great influence on the musical aesthetics of the modern Greeks. Some popular operettas include:
*&quot;Kritikopoula&quot; (Spyridon Samaras, 1916)
*&quot;The Godson&quot; (Theophrastos Sakellaridis, 1918)
*&quot;I want to see the Pope&quot; (Theophrastos Sakellaridis, 1920)
*&quot;Oi Apachides ton Athinon&quot; (Nikos Hatziapostolou, 1921)
*&quot;Beba&quot; (Theophrastos Sakellaridis, 1928)

After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition, Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the tango, samba, waltz, swing, bolero, foxtrot, some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades&#x27; repertory. Nikos Gounaris was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time (often called &quot;Mr. Greece&quot;). Giorgos Mouzakis was a prominent virtuoso trumpeter (borrowed latin jazz elements), while Attik and Michalis Souyioul were also among the most succeeded and popular composers. Notable singers of this style include also Fotis Polymeris, Sofia Vembo (a star of the era), Mary Lo, Danaë Stratigopoulou, Stella Greca and Tony Maroudas.

===Rebetiko===

&quot;Rebetiko&quot; was initially associated with the lower and poor classes, but later reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished. Rebetiko probably originated in the music of the larger Greek cities, most of them coastal, in today&#x27;s Greece and Asia Minor. Emerged by the 1920s as the urban folk music of Greek society&#x27;s outcasts. The earliest Greek rebetiko singers (refugees, drug-users, criminals and itinerants) were scorned by mainstream society. They sang heartrending tales of drug abuse, prison and violence, usually accompanied by the bouzouki.

In 1923, after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, many ethnic Greeks from Asia Minor fled to Greece as a result of the Greco-Turkish War. They settled in poor neighborhoods in Piraeus, Thessaloniki, and Athens. Many of these immigrants were highly educated, such as songwriter Vangelis Papazoglou, and Panagiotis Toundas, composer and leader of Odeon Records&#x27; Greek subsidiary, who are traditionally considered as the founders of the Smyrna school of rebetiko. Another tradition from Smyrna that came along with the Greek refugees was the &quot;tekés&quot; (τεκές) &#x27;opium den&#x27;, or hashish dens. Groups of men would sit in a circle, smoke hashish from a hookah, and improvise music of various kinds.

With the coming of the Metaxas dictatorship, rebetiko was suppressed due to the uncompromising lyrics. Hashish dens, baglamas and bouzouki were banned, or at least playing in the eastern-style manner and scales.

Some of the earliest legends of Greek music, such as the quartet of Anestis Delias, Markos Vamvakaris, Stratos Payioumtzis and Yiorgos Batis came out of this music scene. Vamvakaris became perhaps the first renowned rebetiko musician after the beginning of his solo career. Other popular rebetiko songwriters and singers of this period (1940s) include: Dimitris Gogos (better known as Bayandéras), Stelios Perpiniadis, Spyros Peristeris, Giannis Papaioannou, and Apostolos Hatzichristos.

The scene was soon popularized further by stars like Vassilis Tsitsanis. His song Συννεφιασμένη Κυριακή - &quot;Synnefiasméni Kyriakí&quot; became an anthem for the oppressed Greeks when it was composed in 1943 (during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II), despite the fact that it was not recorded until 1948. He was followed by female singers like Marika Ninou, Ioanna Yiorgakopoulou, and Sotiria Bellou. In 1953, Manolis Chiotis added a fourth pair of strings to the bouzouki, which allowed it to be played as a guitar and set the stage for the future &#x27;electrification&#x27; of rebetiko. This final era of rebetiko (mid 1940s–1953) also featured the emergence of (κέντρα διασκεδάσεως) as a means of popularizing music. By the late 1950s, rebetiko had declined; it only survived in the form of &quot;archontorebetiko&quot; (αρχοντορεμπέτικο &quot;posh rebetiko&quot;), a refined style of rebetiko that was far more accepted by the upper class than the traditional form of the genre. The mainstream popularity of archontorebetiko paved the way for éntekhno and laïkó. In the 1960s Manolis Chiotis popularized the eight-string bouzouki and set the stage for the future &#x27;electrification&#x27; of rebetiko.

Rebetiko in its original form was revived during the Junta of 1967–1974, when the Regime of the Colonels banned it. After the end of the Junta, many revival groups (and solo artists) appeared. The most notable of them include Opisthodromiki Kompania, Rembetiki Kompania, Babis Tsertos, Agathonas Iakovidis and others.

===Éntekhno===

Drawing on rebetiko&#x27;s internationalization by Tsitsanis and Chiotis, &quot;éntekhno&quot; (or &quot;éntechno&quot;) arose in the late 1950s. Éntekhno (art song) is orchestral music with elements from Greek folk rhythm and melody; its lyrical themes are often based on the work of famous Greek poets. As opposed to other forms of Greek urban folk music, éntekhno concerts would often take place outside a hall or a night club in the open air. Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis were the most popular early composers of éntekhno song cycles. They were both educated in Classical music and -among other reasons- the lacking of a wide public for this kind of music in Greece, drove them to the invention of Éntekhno, in which they transferred some values of Western art music, such as ballads tune. 

Theodorakis was the first composer to use the bouzouki in this genre of music, trying to include this organ into the mainstream culture. Other significant Greek songwriters included Stavros Kouyoumtzis, Manos Loïzos, and Dimos Moutsis. Significant lyricists of this genre are Nikos Gatsos, Manos Eleftheriou and poet Tasos Livaditis. By the 1960s, innovative albums helped éntekhno become close to mainstream, and also led to its appropriation by the film industry for use in soundtracks.

A specific form of éntekhno was the so-called &quot;political song&quot;; songs with political message, of the Left, which arose during the military junta and became very popular after its fall in the late &#x27;70s. Manos Loizos, guitarist Panos Tzavellas, Maria Dimitriadi and Maria Farantouri were some representatives. Thanos Mikroutsikos released an album featuring Greek partisan songs of the Greek resistance, with his own orchestration. A form of éntekhno which is even closer to western classical music was introduced during the late 1970s by Mikroutsikos. (See the section &#x27;Other popular trends&#x27; below for further information on Néo Kýma and contemporary éntekhno.)

===Laïkó===

&quot;Laïkó&quot; (λαϊκό τραγούδι &#x27;song of the people&#x27; / &#x27;popular song&#x27; or αστική λαϊκή μουσική &#x27;urban folk music&#x27;), is a Greek music genre that is composed in Greek language in accordance with the tradition of the Greek people. Laïkó followed after the commercialization of rebetiko music. Until the 1930s the Greek discography was dominated by two musical genres: the Greek folk music (&quot;dimotiká&quot;) and the &quot;elafró tragoudi&quot; (literally: &quot;light song&quot;). The latter was the Greek version of the international urban music of the era. &quot;Classic laïkó&quot; (κλασικό/παλιό λαϊκό) as it is known today, was the mainstream popular music of Greece during the 1960s and 1970s. It was dominated by singers such as Grigoris Bithikotsis, Marinella, Stelios Kazantzidis, Panos Gavalas and others. Among the most significant songwriters and lyricists of this period are considered George Zambetas, Manolis Hiotis and Vassilis Tsitsanis; of course the big names of this kind are still in Greek business. The more cheerful version of laïkó, called &quot;elafró laïkó&quot; (ελαφρολαϊκό, &quot;elafrolaïkó&quot; &#x27;light laïkó&#x27;) and it was often used in musicals during the Golden Age of Greek cinema. Contemporary laïkó (σύγχρονο λαϊκό), also called &quot;modern laïkó,&quot; is currently Greece&#x27;s mainstream music genre. Some of the strongest Greek dances and rhythms of today&#x27;s Greek music culture &quot;laïká&quot; are Nisiotika, Syrta, Hasapika, Kalamatiana, zeibekiko, syrtaki and Greek belly dance and the most of them are set to music by the Greek instrumental bouzouki. Thus, on the one hand there is the homogenized Greek popular song, with all the idioms of traditional Greek folk music, and on the other, the peculiar musical trends of the urban rebetiko (song of the cities) known also in Greece as &quot;αστικό&quot;.

Other significant songwriters and lyricists of this category are considered George Zambetas, Akis Panou, Apostolos Kaldaras, Giorgos Mitsakis, Stavros Kouyioumtzis, Lefteris Papadopoulos and Eftichia Papagianopoulos. Many artists have combined the traditions of éntekhno and laïkó with considerable success, such as the composers Mimis Plessas and Stavros Xarchakos.

During the same era, there was also another kind of soft music (ελαφρά μουσική, also called ελαφρό, &quot;elafró&quot; &#x27;soft (song)&#x27;, literally &#x27;light&#x27;) which became fashionable; it was represented by ensembles of singers/musicians such as the Katsamba Brothers duo, the Trio Kitara, the Trio Belcanto, the Trio Atene and others. The genre&#x27;s sound was an imitation of the then contemporary Cuban and Mexican folk music, but also had elements from the early Athenian popular songs.

===Modern laïká===

&quot;Modern laïká&quot; (μοντέρνα λαϊκά)—also &quot;contemporary laïkó&quot;/&quot;laïká&quot; (σύγχρονο λαϊκό/σύγχρονα λαϊκά) or &quot;laïko-pop&quot; (λαϊκο-πόπ)—is currently Greece&#x27;s mainstream music along with some pop recordings.

Modern laïká emerged as a style in the early 1980s. An indispensable part of the contemporary laïká culture is the písta (πίστα; pl.: πίστες) &quot;dance floor/venue&quot;. Night clubs at which the DJs play only contemporary laïká where colloquially known on the 1990s as ellinádika. Over the years until today, the aim of Greek music scene is only one: &quot;quality.&quot; Virtuoso musicians and expressive singers take every season, with more professionalism and love for what they do to entertain the Greek audience, to lure and to make it dance with the songs and music that everyone loves. All this music effort take place in Europe and internationally. Greek-American music includes rebetiko and Greek folk music. The Greek music culture exists as a serious aspect of Hellenic culture, both within Greece and in the diaspora.

Renowned songwriters of modern laïká include Alekos Chrysovergis, Nikos Karvelas, Phoebus, Nikos Terzis and Christos Dantis. Renowned lyricists include Giorgos Theofanous, Evi Droutsa and Natalia Germanou.

;2010s
In the 2010s, several new artists emerged. Artists, such as Kostas Martakis, Panos Kalidis, Ioakim Fokas, Stella Kali, Stan, Katerina Stikoudi, Demy and X-Factor contestants such as Konstantinos Argyros, Eleftheria Eleftheriou and Ivi Adamou. Several artists sometimes incorporated dance-pop elements in their laïko-pop recordings.

====Terminology====
In effect, there is no single name for modern laïká in the Greek language, but it is often formally referred to as σύγχρονο λαϊκό (), a term which is however also used for denoting newly composed songs in the tradition of &quot;proper&quot; laïkó; when ambiguity arises, σύγχρονο (&#x27;contemporary&#x27;) λαϊκό or disparagingly λαϊκο-ποπ (&#x27;folk-pop&#x27;, also in the sense of &quot;westernized&quot;) is used for the former, while γνήσιο (&#x27;genuine&#x27;) or even καθαρόαιμο (&#x27;pureblood&#x27;) λαϊκό is used for the latter. The choice of contrasting the notions of &quot;westernized&quot; and &quot;genuine&quot; may often be based on ideological and aesthetic grounds.

====Criticism====
Despite its popularity, the genre of modern laïká (especially laïko-pop) has come under scrutiny for &quot;featuring musical clichés, average singing voices and slogan-like lyrics&quot; and for &quot;being a hybrid, neither laïkó, nor pop&quot;.

===Skyládiko===

&quot;Skyládiko&quot; (; pl.: &quot;Skyládika&quot;; , meaning &quot;doghouse&quot;) is a derogatory term to describe some branches of laïkó music and some of the current nightclubs in Greece in which a form of popular Greek music is performed. It is performed with electric bouzouki and guitars. It is associated with mass entertainment of lower quality and until the 1970s was marginal, but gained popularity after the 1980s. Critics of this genre relate it with modern laïká, mentioning the low quality and the indispensable common part of the &quot;pista&quot; (πίστα, pl.: πίστες) &quot;dance floor/venue&quot;.

===Other popular trends===
====New Wave (Néo Kýma)====
Folk singer-songwriters (τραγουδοποιοί) first appeared in the 1960s after Dionysis Savvopoulos&#x27; 1966 breakthrough album &quot;Fortigó&quot;. Many of these musicians started out playing &quot;Néo Kýma&quot;, &quot;New wave&quot; (not to be confused with new wave music, the British-born genre), a mixture of éntekhno and chansons from France. Savvopoulos mixed American musicians like Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa with Macedonian folk music and politically incisive lyrics. In his wake came more folk-influenced performers like Arleta, Mariza Koch, Mihalis Violaris, Kostas Hatzis and the composer Giannis Spanos. This music scene flourished in a specific type of &quot;&quot;.

====Political song====
A notable musical trend in the 1970s (during the Junta of 1967–1974 and a few years after its end) was the rise in popularity of the topical songs (πολιτικό τραγούδι &quot;political song&quot;). Classic éntekhno composers associated with this movement include Mikis Theodorakis, Thanos Mikroutsikos, Giannis Markopoulos, and Manos Loïzos.

====Other====
Nikos Xydakis, one of Savvopoulos&#x27; pupils, was among the people who revolutionized laïkó by using orientalized instrumentation. His most successful album was 1987&#x27;s &quot;Kondá sti Dóxa miá Stigmí&quot;, recorded with Eleftheria Arvanitaki.

Thanasis Polykandriotis, laïkó composer and classically trained bouzouki player, became renowned for his mixture of rebetiko and orchestral music (as in his 1996 composition &quot;Concert for Bouzouki and Orchestra No. 1&quot;).

A popular trend since the late 1980s has been the fusion of éntekhno (urban folk ballads with artistic lyrics) with pop / soft rock music (έντεχνο ποπ-ροκ). Moreover, certain composers, such as Dimitris Papadimitriou have been inspired by elements of the classic éntekhno tradition and written songs cycles for singers of contemporary éntekhno music, such as Fotini Darra. The most renowned contemporary éntekhno (σύγχρονο έντεχνο) lyricist is Lina Nikolakopoulou.

There are however other composers of instrumental and incidental music (including filmscores and music for the stage), whose work cannot be easily classified, such as Stamatis Spanoudakis, Giannis Spanos, Giorgos Hatzinasios, Giorgos Tsangaris, Nikos Kypourgos, Nikos Mamangakis, Eleni Karaindrou, and Evanthia Remboutsika. Vangelis and Yanni were also Greek instrumental composers who became internationally renowned.

Even though it has always had a considerable number of listeners supporting it throughout the history of the post 1960s Greek music, it is only very recently (late 2000s) that pop-oriented music has reached the popularity of laïkó/laïká, and there is a tendency among many urban folk artists to turn to more pop-oriented sounds.

===Independent music scenes===
Since the late 1970s various independent scenes of &quot;marginal&quot; musical genres have appeared in Greece (mainly in Athens, Piraeus, and Thessaloniki).

<doc id="246228" wikidata="Q1387837" url="?curid=246228" title="Oliver Mowat">
<text>Sir Oliver Mowat (July 22, 1820 – April 19, 1903) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and Ontario Liberal Party leader. He served for nearly 24 years as the third premier of Ontario. He was the eighth lieutenant governor of Ontario and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He is best known for defending successfully the constitutional rights of the provinces in the face of the centralizing tendency of the national government as represented by his longtime Conservative adversary, John A. Macdonald. This longevity and power was due to his manoeuvring to build a political base around Liberals, Catholics, trade unions, and anti-French-Canadian sentiment.

==Early years==
Mowat was born in Kingston, Upper Canada (now Ontario), to John Mowat and Helen Levack, Scottish Presbyterians who both emigrated from Caithness, Scotland. As a youth, he had taken up arms with the loyalists during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, which suggested a conservative inclination in politics. But he instead joined the Reformers.

==Marriage, family, and legal success==
Mowat was called to the bar of Upper Canada on November 5, 1841. In 1846, he married Jane Ewart, a daughter of John Ewart of Toronto. Mowat and his wife had three sons and four daughters. In 1856 Mowat was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

He was known to be a tenacious legal practitioner, with two of his cases being upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In the 1858 case &quot;Bowes v. City of Toronto&quot;, John George Bowes (previously mayor of Toronto) was successfully sued for recovery of the share of the profit he was suspected to have made in collaboration with co-premier Francis Hincks out of a speculation in city debentures. Afterwards, Mowat admitted, &quot;I cannot speak with much force unless I have an opponent, and things are said by others which I do not altogether coincide with.&quot;

==Political career before Confederation==

Mowat first entered politics as an alderman of the City of Toronto in 1857. From there, he became a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for South Ontario. As a member of the Assembly from 1858 to 1867, he was closely associated with George Brown. Mowat served as Provincial Secretary (1858) and Postmaster-General (1863–1864) in the pre-Confederation governments of George Brown and John Sandfield Macdonald for the Liberal Party of Canada.

Mowat was a member of the Great Coalition government of 1864 and was a representative at that year&#x27;s Quebec Conference, where he helped work out the division of powers between the federal and provincial governments. On November 14, 1864, he was appointed to the judiciary as Vice-Chancellor of the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada, He held this position until he was appointed premier on October 25, 1872. One of the more notable cases during his time on the Court was &quot;Dickson v Burnham&quot; in 1868, whose underlying jurisprudence would be altered during his later time as Premier, with the passage of the &quot;Rivers and Streams Act, 1884&quot;.

==Premier and Attorney-General of Ontario==
Mowat served as provincial member for the riding of Oxford North, about 150 km west of Toronto, for his entire term as premier.

As premier in the 1880s a series of disputes with the Dominion arose over Provincial boundaries, jurisdiction over liquor licenses, trade and commerce, rivers and streams, timber, escheats, and other matters. In 1890, it was said:

These court battles resulted in a weakening of the power of the federal government in provincial matters. Although Macdonald had dismissed him as &quot;Blake&#x27;s jackal&quot;, Mowat&#x27;s battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than Macdonald had intended.

He also served as his own Attorney-General concurrently with his service as Premier, and introduced reforms such as the secret ballot in elections, and the extension of suffrage beyond property owners. He also extended laws regulating liquor and consolidated the laws relating to the municipal level of government. His policies, particularly regarding liquor regulation and separate schools, routinely drew criticism from political conservatives, including the Orange Lodge and its associated newspaper, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.

The boundary between Ontario and Manitoba became a hotly contested matter, with the federal government attempting to extend Manitoba&#x27;s jurisdiction eastward to the Great Lakes, into the areas that Ontario claimed. In 1882, Premier Mowat threatened to pull Ontario from Confederation over the issue. Mowat sent police into the disputed territory to assert Ontario&#x27;s claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, serving as Canada&#x27;s highest appeal court, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights. These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a more decentralized federation. John Ibbitson writes that by 1914:
:Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald&#x27;s worst nightmare. Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes—even income taxes, in a few cases—exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.

George William Ross praised Mowat&#x27;s ability to read the public mind, and John Stephen Willison remarked that his political genius rose from &quot;the fact that for so long he had a generous support from the liquor interest and a still more generous support from Prohibitionists&quot;.

His government was moderate and attempted to cut across divisions in the province between Roman Catholics and Protestants as well as between country and city. He also oversaw the northward expansion of Ontario&#x27;s boundaries and the development of its natural resources, as well as the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada.

Mowat&#x27;s nearly 24 years as premier of Ontario remains the longest consecutive service by any premier in Ontario history, and is the third longest by any premier in Canada, behind only George Henry Murray of Nova Scotia and Ernest Manning of Alberta.

Mowat was notoriously hostile to aboriginal and treaty rights. In 1884, when the federal government urged that Ontario transfer to the Teme-Augama Anishnabai indigenous people all or some of the 2,770 square miles as a reserve, for which that band&#x27;s head chief, Ignace Tonené, had campaigned with the federal authorities for many years, Mowat blocked the land transfer, primarily concerned about the value of the red and white pine lumber at the location. It was not until 1943 that lands were finally set aside for the Temagami, and the official creation of their Bear Island Reserve did not occur until 1971.

==Federal level==

In 1896, the leader of the opposition, Wilfrid Laurier, convinced Mowat to enter federal politics. It was thought that the combination of a French Canadian (Laurier) and the prestige of Oliver Mowat in Ontario would be a winning ticket for the Liberal party. The slogan was &quot;Laurier, Mowat and Victory&quot;. Victory was won, and Mowat became Minister of Justice and Senator.

In 1897, he was appointed the eighth Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and served until his death in office in 1903. He is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

==Macdonald and Mowat in power==
The two former Kingston law partners, Macdonald as prime minister in Ottawa and Mowat as premier in Toronto, led their respective governments during the same era for a total of 14 years. Mowat was premier for just under 24 years.

==Family==
Mowat&#x27;s daughter, Jane Helen Mowat, married Charles Robert Webster Biggar, who wrote a two-volume biography of Mowat in 1905. Their son Oliver Mowat Biggar became Canada&#x27;s first Chief Electoral Officer. Sir Oliver Mowat&#x27;s son Frederick Mowat was the father-in-law of the diabetologist Andrew Almon Fletcher.

Sir Oliver Mowat was also the great-granduncle of the Canadian author, Farley Mowat. The son of Angus Mowat, a famed Canadian librarian that served in the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

==Other achievements==

Mowat was knighted in 1892, increasing his importance in Canada.

Mowat was himself the author of two small books in the field of Christian apologetics:
:* 

Mowat also documented his government&#x27;s first 18 years of Ontario government (from 1872 to 1890) in an 1890 book.

==Legacy==

After his death, Wilfrid Laurier placed Mowat&#x27;s policy of sectarian tolerance second in historical importance only to his role in giving Confederation its character as a federal compact. He credited Mowat with giving Ontario &quot;a Government which can be cited as a model for all Governments: a Government which was honest, progressive, courageous, and tolerant&quot;.

By nature a secretive individual, he left instructions in his will that resulted in the destruction of nearly all his papers.

Mowat is honoured by a statue in Queen&#x27;s Park. Mowat Avenue in Kingston is named in his honour.

Mowat is the inspiration for the naming of The Mowat Centre, an independent Canadian public policy think tank associated with the School of Public Policy &amp; Governance at the University of Toronto.

The Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute in Toronto was named in his honour.

Queen&#x27;s University organized a two-day historical colloquium in 1970 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Mowat&#x27;s birth.

Mowat was portrayed by David Onley (the 28th Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario) in the Canadian TV series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; in 2013 in the episode &quot;The Ghost of Queen&#x27;s Park.&quot;

Mowat was portrayed by Kingston actor Patrick Downes, in 2015, in Kingston-based Salon Theatre&#x27;s stage productions featuring the life of John A. Macdonald, staged during the Bicentennial celebrations of Macdonald&#x27;s birth.

The building where Mowat and Macdonald practiced law together in the 1830s, on the east side of Wellington Street between Princess and Brock Streets in Kingston, was renovated, restored, and expanded, from 2014 to 2018, but has had its heritage elements preserved, insofar as possible, under direction from Kingston City Council. The building re-opened as the &#x27;Kensington&#x27; in 2018, and now features, on its street level, an alley portraying historical and heritage aspects of its past, along with the Macdonald-Mowat relationship.

<doc id="246235" wikidata="Q4816008" url="?curid=246235" title="Atlanta Beat (WUSA)">
<text>The Atlanta Beat was a professional soccer team that played in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association. The team played at Bobby Dodd Stadium on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology in its first year of operation before moving to Herndon Stadium, on the campus of Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Georgia.

==History==
The team began play in 2001, and reached the playoffs in each of the WUSA&#x27;s three seasons — the only team in the league to do so. They advanced to the Founders Cup in both 2001 and 2003, losing on both occasions.

The Beat&#x27;s &quot;founding players&quot; were Briana Scurry, Cindy Parlow, and Nikki Serlenga of the USA women&#x27;s national team. The Beat had the #1 pick in the inaugural WUSA draft, and selected China&#x27;s Sun Wen, star of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Their first goal was scored by Japan star midfielder Homare Sawa.

The coach of the Atlanta Beat was Tom Stone.

==League Suspension==
The WUSA announced on September 15, 2003, that it was suspending operations. Several former Beat players went on to play for the Atlanta Silverbacks Women in the W-League, and five – Briana Scurry, Sharolta Nonen, Homare Sawa, Nancy Augustyniak, and Ifeoma Dieke—played in Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer.

It was announced on October 7, 2009, that a newly formed version of the Atlanta Beat would be joining WPS. On June 17, 2009, the new Atlanta Beat announced that Shawn McGee would be the General Manager of the recently reformed team.

<doc id="246238" wikidata="Q7013856" url="?curid=246238" title="New York Power">
<text>The New York Power was an American professional soccer team that played in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), the first professional soccer league for women in the United States. The team played at Mitchel Athletic Complex in Uniondale, New York. The team played from 2001 to 2003 when the league ceased operations.

==History==

On February 15, 2000, it was announced that the first professional women&#x27;s soccer league would be formed by a number of major U.S. media companies and individual investors in response to the successful and hugely popular U.S. women&#x27;s national soccer team who had won the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Time Warner Cable invested $5,000,000 for the operating rights for a team in the New York market. In addition to the upfront financial investment, league investors also provided resources for staff, facilities, and promotional efforts via cable television.

===Team name and stadium unveiled===
On November 16, 2000, the league announced the names of the eight teams admitted in the league. The New York Power was announced as the team name for the New York area with games to be played at the 10,000 capacity Mitchel Athletic Complex, a multi-purpose athletic facility located in Uniondale, New York. The team name was selected by team&#x27;s front office with the slogan &quot;Get emPOWERed&quot; used in promotional materials.
===Inaugural season===

The Power began play in 2001 during the inaugural season of the WUSA. The team finished the regular season with a 9–7–5 record third in the standings. They reached the semi-finals in the playoffs where they faced the Bay Area CyberRays and lost 3–2. Average attendance for the club&#x27;s home games during the 2001 season was 5,724. Tiffeny Milbrett was the leading scorer on the team with 16 goals on the season. She also led the team in points (35), shots (73), shots on goal (42), and game-winning goals (4). Goalkeeper Gao Hong recorded 87 saves with a 1.11 goals against average (GAA).

===2002 season=== 
During the league&#x27;s second season, the Power finished last in the regular season standings with a 3–17–1 record. The club had a rough time recovering from a number of injuries and the retirement of Norwegian defender Gro Espeseth, who departed after the inaugural season. Goalkeeper Gao Hong, defender Christie Pearce and defender-midfielder Sara Whalen all suffered injuries destabilizing the team. In July, head coach Pat Farmer was fired after the team lost many more games than it won or tied. Assistant coach and former Rutgers University coach Charles Duccilli was named head coach. The team&#x27;s general manager, Susan Marenoff, said of the coaching swap, &quot;The team needed a change ... Pat worked very hard to make the best team he could. I really think we needed a different style, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve accomplished.&quot;

===2003 season===
The Power re-surged during the 2003 season to finish fifth among the league&#x27;s eight teams, narrowly missing the playoffs. Australia women&#x27;s national team coach and San Jose CyberRays assistant coach, Tom Sermanni, was named head coach during the 2002 postseason. The Power finished the regular season with a 7–9–5 record. Forward Christie Welsh led the team in goals with six while midfielder Shannon Boxx led in assists with eight. Inaugural season star Tiffeny Milbrett ranked second on the team for goals (5) and assists (6) and led the team in shots (51), shots on goal (22) and points (16). Goalkeeper Saskia Webber made 50 saves during her 13 appearances for the club recording a 1.52 goals against average (GAA).

==Year-by-year==
==Players==
The &quot;founding players&quot; of the Power were Tiffeny Milbrett, Christie Pearce and Sara Whalen of the 1999 U.S. Women&#x27;s World Cup team. International players who played for the Power included Ann Kristin Aarønes (Norway), Gro Espeseth (Norway), Gao Hong (China), Cheryl Salisbury (Australia) and Anita Rapp (Norway).

<text>The Washington Freedom were an American professional soccer club based in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Germantown, Maryland, that participated in Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer. The Freedom was founded in 2001 as a member of the defunct Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association. Beginning in 2004, the Freedom played its home games at the Maryland SoccerPlex. In 2011, the team relocated to Boca Raton, Florida, and became magicJack.

== History ==

=== WUSA (2001–03) ===

The team played its home games at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., where the team offices were also located. The team&#x27;s &quot;founding players&quot; (players from the national team allocated three to each WUSA team) were Mia Hamm, Siri Mullinix and Michelle French. They were expected by some to be one of the best in the league but finished seventh out of the eight teams their first season.

However, this finish allowed the Freedom to select Abby Wambach as their first pick in the 2002 WUSA draft. Additional personnel changes, better performance from retained players, and a Mia Hamm improved by off-season knee surgery led to a far better finish, as Washington went undefeated in their last eight matches and finished in third place (only two points out of first). In the postseason, they won their semifinal match against the Philadelphia Charge, 1–0, and went to the Founders Cup, the WUSA championship match, which they lost, 3–2, to the Carolina Courage.
In 2003, the Freedom were just good enough to make the playoffs, clinching the fourth and final spot with two games to go. However, they would go on to beat the regular season champion Boston Breakers in the semifinals, 0–0 (3–1 penalty kick shootout), and then defeated the Atlanta Beat in the Founders Cup, 2–1, in overtime. It was the last Golden Goal in a FIFA-sanctioned first-division league before the practice was changed.

=== Exhibition years (2004–05) ===
After the WUSA folded, the Freedom maintained an existence as the Washington Freedom Soccer Club, moving their home stadium to the Maryland Soccerplex and putting together a team called Washington Freedom Reserves, which consisted of half-a-dozen players from the WUSA days along with young local players. In 2004, they played assorted exhibition matches against college and W-League teams and participated in the WUSA Festivals.

In 2005, the roster was significantly upgraded by adding former WUSA players like Tiffany Roberts, Kylie Bivens, and Emily Janss, as well as players Ali Krieger and Joanna Lohman from the U-21 National Team. The team also brought in former star soccer players Sun Wen and Brandi Chastain as guest players for one game each. In a season of exhibition matches, almost all against W-League teams, the Freedom compiled a 7–2–2 record.

=== W-League (2006–08) ===
The team became an associate member of the W-League in 2006 and played an exhibition season based on home-and-home series against east coast W-League teams. Then, on December 7, 2006, Washington announced that they had acquired a full W-League franchise.

In 2007, playing games that mattered for the first time since 2003, the Freedom compiled a 12–1–1 record, defeated the regular season champion Ottawa Fury in the Eastern Conference championship game, then went on to beat the Atlanta Silverbacks, 3–1, in the W-League championship match.

In 2008, the Freedom went 11–1–2 in the regular season, winning the Northeast Division, then defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks, 2–1, to capture the Eastern Conference championship, but then fell to the eventual W-League champion Pali Blues, 2–0, in the W-League semifinals.

=== Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer: The first season (2009)===
When the Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer league formed in 2008, the Freedom became one of the original seven teams that started play in 2009.

The initial WPS player allocation, announced on September 16, 2008, assigned US Women&#x27;s National Team players Abby Wambach, Cat Whitehill and Ali Krieger to the Freedom. Wambach had played for the Freedom in 2002 and 2003, while Krieger played for the Washington Freedom Reserves in 2004 and 2005, and for the W-League team in 2007.

In the 2008 WPS International Draft, conducted on September 24, 2008, the Freedom selected Japanese striker Homare Sawa, French players Sonia Bompastor and Louisa Necib and Australian forward Lisa De Vanna. Following the draft, the Freedom named Erin McLeod and Lene Mykjåland as post-draft discovery players.

Following that was the 2008 WPS General Draft on October 6, 2008, and all of the players selected by the Freedom were from the Freedom&#x27;s 2008 W-League roster: Sarah Huffman, Becky Sauerbrunn, Lori Lindsey and Emily Janss. Lindsey had been on the Freedom roster since the final WUSA season in 2003, and Janss had been with the team since 2005.

The 2009 WPS Draft took place on January 16, 2009. The Freedom drafted Allie Long, Alex Singer, Jill Gilbeau, Parrissa Eyorokon, Briana Scurry, Rebecca Moros, Sarah Senty, Kati Jo Spisak, Claire Zimmeck, and Christen Karniski. Additionally, the Freedom received the rights to Joanna Lohman in a trade with Saint Louis Athletica. All of the players except for Long, Eyorokon, and Scurry had previous experience playing for the Freedom&#x27;s W-League team.

Two players were added to the roster after tryouts and training camp: Kristin DeDycker and Madison Keller. Keller had experience with the Freedom going back to 2004, while DeDycker (née Warren) had played for the Atlanta Beat in the WUSA.

McLeod was intended to be the starting goalkeeper, but visa issues kept her unavailable through the first five matches of the regular season, and the Freedom had mixed success with Briana Scurry and Kati Jo Spisak in goal. Following her arrival, though, the Freedom won three out of the next six matches while only losing once.

Abby Wambach, meanwhile, was recovering from a broken leg and didn&#x27;t feel fully recovered until late in the season, when she returned from national team duty having scored her 100th international goal. She then went on a tear, scoring five goals and two assists in the team&#x27;s final four games. The Freedom won three of those four matches and thereby clinched third place in the standings and a home playoff match. But despite looking strong going into the playoff match, and coming off a solid 3–1 victory over their opponents, Sky Blue FC, they put on a listless performance and were eliminated from the playoffs, 2–1.

=== Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer: season two (2010)===
Unlike most of the other WPS teams, the Freedom made only limited changes in the offseason. The marquee signing was of young forward Lene Mykjåland from the Norway national football team, followed by picking up Nikki Marshall, Beverly Goebel, Kristi Eveland, and Caitlin Miskel in the 2010 college draft. The team then signed Christie Welsh, who had helped lead the 2007 Freedom to the W-League championship before being drafted by the WPS Los Angeles Sol and then traded to the St. Louis Athletica. Brittany Bock was acquired in the dispersal draft to place former Los Angeles Sol players. Marisa Abegg and Meagan McCray were brought in after going unsigned by their former WPS team, FC Gold Pride. After the St. Louis Athletica folded, the Freedom signed their 2010 second-round draft pick Ashlyn Harris, who went on to become the starting goalkeeper after Erin McLeod tore her ACL in a match on July 24. On August 5, the Freedom traded their rights to Nigerian defender Faith Ikidi to the Chicago Red Stars for England national team defender Anita Asante.

Players did not return for several reasons. Lori Lindsey and Sarah Senty were picked up in the expansion draft by the Philadelphia Independence, one of the two new WPS teams for 2010. Lindsey had originally joined the team in 2003 during its last year in the WUSA, while Senty joined the W-League team in 2007. Ali Krieger signed a two-year contract with FFC Frankfurt, keeping her there into 2012. Other players with extended Freedom experience not re-signed included Emily Janss (since 2005), Joanna Lohman (2005), Kati Jo Spisak (2007), and Christen Karniski (2008). Additionally, Alex Singer, who joined the W-League team in 2007, was cut on August 5 to make room for Anita Asante.

The Freedom started their season solidly in April and May, with a 4–2–1 record good enough for second place. However, in July and August they went on a ten-game winless streak ending with five losses in a row that put them out of playoff position and put head coach Gabarra&#x27;s job in jeopardy. Longtime assistant coach Clyde Watson resigned and former Chicago Red Stars head coach Emma Hayes was hired as a consultant. The team rebounded to finish the regular season 4–1–2, good enough for the fourth and final playoff position. That led to a road match against the Philadelphia Independence, which the Freedom lost on a goal from Amy Rodriguez in the waning seconds of overtime, wasting a superb performance from rookie backup goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris.

Following the season, Gabarra announced his resignation, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; between himself and team management.

=== Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer: purchase, relocation, and termination (2011)===
Financial troubles that had stirred in the background during the middle of the previous season came to the front during the offseason, with the longtime team owners finally deciding to back out after ten years of supporting the club. With multiple teams having trouble making offseason payments, the league was under threat of folding.

Dan Borislow, owner of the phone service MagicJack, bought the Freedom in 2011. He changed the team name to Magicjack and moved the team to Boca Raton, Florida. He quickly came into conflict with the players and owners of other teams and the league terminated the franchise on October 25, 2011, accusing Borislow of misconduct. The WPS subsequently cancelled the 2012 season and the WPS ceased to exist.

==Competition history==
The Washington Freedom was one of the eight professional soccer teams that played in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association from 2001 to 2003. The team won the WUSA Founders Cup III in their final year, shortly before the league announced on September 15, 2003, that it was suspending operations. Unique among the WUSA teams, though, the Freedom maintained a continued existence, playing exhibition seasons in 2004 and 2005, then joining the USL W-League in 2006 and winning the W-League Championship in 2007. The Freedom became a part of Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer that launched in April 2009 and participated in that league in 2009 and 2010. The team was then sold, moved to Florida, and renamed MagicJack.

Despite the addition of a professional team, the Freedom maintained an elite amateur team, which played in the W-League in 2009 and 2010, finishing second in the league in 2009.

Since the WUSA ended, the Washington Freedom has played most of their home matches at the Soccerplex in Maryland. They have, however, continued to play some games at RFK as doubleheaders with DC United. These include games as the Freedom Reserves in 2004, while in the W-League, and since joining the WPS. They played three doubleheaders in 2009 and one doubleheader in 2010.

<doc id="246242" wikidata="Q1985730" url="?curid=246242" title="Homestead strike">
<text>The Homestead strike, also known as the Homestead steel strike, Homestead massacre, or Battle of Homestead, was an industrial lockout and strike that began on July 1, 1892, culminating in a battle in which strikers defeated private security agents on July 6, 1892. 
The governor responded by sending in the National Guard to protect strikebreakers. The dispute occurred at the Homestead Steel Works in the Pittsburgh-area town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA) and the Carnegie Steel Company. The final result was a major defeat for the union strikers and a setback for their efforts to unionize steelworkers. The battle was a pivotal event in U.S. labor history.

==Background==
Carnegie Steel made major technological innovations in the 1880s, especially the installation of the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, charging machines, and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with unskilled workers. However, while Carnegie Steel grew and progressed, workers at Homestead were seeing their wages drop.

==Union==

The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) was an American labor union formed in 1876. It was a craft union representing skilled iron and steelworkers.

The AA&#x27;s membership was concentrated in ironworks west of the Allegheny Mountains. The union negotiated national uniform wage scales on an annual basis; helped regulate working hours, workload levels and work speeds; and helped improve working conditions. It also acted as a hiring hall, helping employers find scarce puddlers and rollers.

The AA organized the independently owned Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works in Homestead in 1881. The AA engaged in a strike at the Homestead works on January 1, 1882, in an effort to prevent management from including a non-union clause in the workers&#x27; contracts, known as a &quot;yellow-dog contract&quot;. The violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous strikebreakers. The strike ended on March 20, in a complete victory for the union.

The AA struck the steel plant again on July 1, 1889, when negotiations for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement failed. The strikers seized the town and once again made common cause with various immigrant groups. Backed by 2,000 townspeople, the strikers drove off a trainload of strikebreakers on July 10. When the sheriff returned with 125 newly deputized agents two days later, the strikers rallied 5,000 townspeople to their cause. Although victorious, the union agreed to significant wage cuts that left tonnage rates less than half those at the nearby Jones and Laughlin works, where technological improvements had not yet been made.

Carnegie officials conceded that the AA essentially ran the Homestead plant after the 1889 strike. The union contract contained 58 pages of footnotes defining work rules at the plant and strictly limited management&#x27;s ability to maximize output.

For its part, the AA saw substantial gains after the 1889 strike. Membership doubled, and the local union treasury had a balance of $146,000. The Homestead union grew belligerent, and relationships between workers and managers became tense.

==Nature of the 1892 strike==
The Homestead strike was organized and purposeful, a harbinger of the type of strike which marked the modern age of labor relations in the United States. The AA strike at the Homestead steel mill in 1892 was different from previous large-scale strikes in American history such as the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 or the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886. Earlier strikes had been largely leaderless and disorganized mass uprisings of workers.

==Plans of Carnegie and Frick==

Andrew Carnegie placed industrialist Henry Clay Frick in charge of his company&#x27;s operations in 1881. Frick resolved to break the union at Homestead. &quot;The mills have never been able to turn out the product they should, owing to being held back by the Amalgamated men,&quot; he complained in a letter to Carnegie.

Carnegie was publicly in favor of labor unions. He condemned the use of strikebreakers and told associates that no steel mill was worth a single drop of blood. But Carnegie agreed with Frick&#x27;s desire to break the union and &quot;reorganize the whole affair, and ... exact good reasons for employing every man. Far too many men required by Amalgamated rules.&quot; Carnegie ordered the Homestead plant to manufacture large amounts of inventory so the plant could weather a strike. He also drafted a notice (which Frick never released) withdrawing recognition of the union.

With the collective bargaining agreement due to expire on June 30, 1892, Frick and the leaders of the local AA union entered into negotiations in February. With the steel industry doing well and prices higher, the AA asked for a wage increase; the AA represented about 800 of the 3,800 workers at the plant. Frick immediately countered with a 22% wage decrease that would affect nearly half the union&#x27;s membership and remove a number of positions from the bargaining unit. Carnegie encouraged Frick to use the negotiations to break the union: &quot;...the Firm has decided that the minority must give way to the majority. These works, therefore, will be necessarily non-union after the expiration of the present agreement.&quot; Carnegie believed that the Amalgamated was a hindrance to efficiency; furthermore it was not representative of the workers. It admitted only a small group of skilled workers. It was in its own way an elitist, discriminatory organization that was not worthy of the republic, Carnegie felt.

Frick announced on April 30, 1892, that he would bargain for 29 more days. If no contract was reached, Carnegie Steel would cease to recognize the union. Carnegie formally approved Frick&#x27;s tactics on May 4. Then Frick offered a slightly better wage scale and advised the superintendent to tell the workers, &quot;We do not care whether a man belongs to a union or not, nor do we wish to interfere. He may belong to as many unions or organizations as he chooses, but we think our employees at Homestead Steel Works would fare much better working under the system in vogue at Edgar Thomson and Duquesne.&quot;

==Lockout==
Frick locked workers out of the plate mill and one of the open hearth furnaces on the evening of June 28. When no collective bargaining agreement was reached by June 29, Frick locked the union out of the rest of the plant. A high fence topped with barbed wire, begun in January, was completed and the plant sealed to the workers. Sniper towers with searchlights were constructed near each mill building, and high-pressure water cannons (some capable of spraying boiling-hot liquid) were placed at each entrance. Various aspects of the plant were protected, reinforced, or shielded.

At a mass meeting on June 30, local AA leaders reviewed the final negotiating sessions and announced that the company had broken the contract by locking out workers a day before the contract expired. The Knights of Labor, which had organized the mechanics and transportation workers at Homestead, agreed to walk out alongside the skilled workers of the AA. Workers at Carnegie plants in Pittsburgh, Duquesne, Union Mills and Beaver Falls struck in sympathy the same day.

The Declaration of the Strike Committee, dated July 20, 1892 reads in part,

The employees in the mill of Messrs. Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Co., at Homestead, Pa., have built there a town with its homes, its schools and its churches; have for many years been faithful co-workers with the company in the business of the mill; have invested thousands of dollars of their savings in said mill in the expectation of spending their lives in Homestead and of working in the mill during the period of their efficiency. … &quot;Therefore, the committee desires to express to the public as its firm belief that both the public and the employees aforesaid have equitable rights and interests in the said mill which cannot be modified or diverted without due process of law; that the employees have the right to continuous employment in the said mill during efficiency and good behavior without regard to religious, political or economic opinions or associations; that it is against public policy and subversive of the fundamental principles of American liberty that a whole community of workers should be denied employment or suffer any other social detriment on account of membership in a church, a political party or a trade union; that it is our duty as American citizens to resist by every legal and ordinary means the unconstitutional, anarchic and revolutionary policy of the Carnegie Company, which seems to evince a contempt [for] public and private interests and a disdain [for] the public conscience. . . .

The strikers were determined to keep the plant closed. They secured a steam-powered river launch and several rowboats to patrol the Monongahela River, which ran alongside the plant. Men also divided themselves into units along military lines. Picket lines were thrown up around the plant and the town, and 24-hour shifts established. Ferries and trains were watched. Strangers were challenged to give explanations for their presence in town; if one was not forthcoming, they were escorted outside the city limits. Telegraph communications with AA locals in other cities were established to keep tabs on the company&#x27;s attempts to hire replacement workers. Reporters were issued special badges which gave them safe passage through the town, but the badges were withdrawn if it was felt misleading or false information made it into the news. Tavern owners were even asked to prevent excessive drinking.

Frick was also busy. The company placed ads for replacement workers in newspapers as far away as Boston, St. Louis and even Europe.

But unprotected strikebreakers would be driven off. On July 4, Frick formally requested that Sheriff William H. McCleary intervene to allow supervisors access to the plant. Carnegie corporation attorney Philander Knox gave the go-ahead to the sheriff on July 5, and McCleary dispatched 11 deputies to the town to post handbills ordering the strikers to stop interfering with the plant&#x27;s operation. The strikers tore down the handbills and told the deputies that they would not turn over the plant to nonunion workers. Then they herded the deputies onto a boat and sent them downriver to Pittsburgh.

Frick had ordered the construction of a solid board fence topped with barbed wire around mill property. The workers dubbed the newly fortified mill &quot;Fort Frick&quot;.

==Battle on July 6==
Frick&#x27;s intent was to open the works with nonunion men on July 6. Knox devised a plan to get the Pinkertons onto the mill property. With the mill ringed by striking workers, agents from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, which Frick had contracted to provide security at the plant in April 1892, planned to access the plant grounds from the river. Three hundred Pinkerton agents assembled on the Davis Island Dam on the Ohio River about five miles below Pittsburgh at 10:30 p.m. on the night of July 5, 1892. They were given Winchester rifles, placed on two specially-equipped barges and towed upriver. They were also given badges which read &quot;Watchman, Carnegie Company, Limited&quot;. Many had been hired out of lodging houses at $2.50 per day and were unaware of what their assignment was in Homestead.

The strikers were prepared for the Pinkerton agents; the AA had learned of the Pinkertons as soon as they had left Boston for the embarkation point. The small flotilla of union boats went downriver to meet the barges. Strikers on the steam launch fired a few random shots at the barges, then withdrew—blowing the launch whistle to alert the plant. The strikers blew the plant whistle at 2:30 a.m., drawing thousands of men, women and children to the plant.

===Pinkertons attempt to land===
The Pinkertons attempted to land under cover of darkness about 4 a.m. A large crowd of families had kept pace with the boats as they were towed by a tug into the town. A few shots were fired at the tug and barges, but no one was injured. The crowd tore down the barbed-wire fence and strikers and their families surged onto the Homestead plant grounds. Some in the crowd threw stones at the barges, but strike leaders shouted for restraint.

The Pinkerton agents attempted to disembark, and more shots were fired. Conflicting testimony exists as to which side fired the first shot in this encounter. (Shooting having begun earlier when the barges were being towed up the river) John T. McCurry, a boatman on the steamboat &quot;Little Bill&quot; (which had been hired by the Pinkerton Detective Agency to ferry its agents to the steel mill) and one of the men wounded by the strikers, said: &quot;The armed Pinkerton men commenced to climb up the banks. Then the workmen opened fire on the detectives. The men shot first, and not until three of the Pinkerton men had fallen did they respond to the fire. I am willing to take an oath that the workmen fired first, and that the Pinkerton men did not shoot until some of their number had been wounded.&quot; But according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Pinkertons shot first. The newspaper reported that the Pinkertons opened fire and wounded William Foy, a worker. Regardless of which side opened fire first, the first two individuals wounded were Frederick Heinde, captain of the Pinkertons, and Foy. The Pinkerton agents aboard the barges then fired into the crowd, killing two and wounding eleven. The crowd responded in kind, killing two and wounding twelve. The firefight continued for about 10 minutes.

The strikers then huddled behind the pig and scrap iron in the mill yard, while the Pinkertons cut holes in the side of the barges so they could fire on any who approached. The Pinkerton tug departed with the wounded agents, leaving the barges stranded. The strikers soon set to work building a rampart of steel beams further up the riverbank from which they could fire down on the barges. Hundreds of women continued to crowd on the riverbank between the strikers and the agents, calling on the strikers to &#x27;kill the Pinkertons&#x27;.

The strikers continued to sporadically fire on the barges. Union members took potshots at the ships from their rowboats and the steam-powered launch. The burgess of Homestead, John McLuckie, issued a proclamation at 6:00 a.m. asking for townspeople to help defend the peace; more than 5,000 people congregated on the hills overlooking the steelworks. A 20-pounder brass cannon was set up on the shore opposite the steel mill, and an attempt was made to sink the barges. Six miles away in Pittsburgh, thousands of steelworkers gathered in the streets, listening to accounts of the attacks at Homestead; hundreds, many of them armed, began to move toward the town to assist the strikers.

The Pinkertons attempted to disembark again at 8:00 a.m. A striker high up the riverbank fired a shot. The Pinkertons returned fire, and four more strikers were killed (one by shrapnel sent flying when cannon fire hit one of the barges). Many of the Pinkerton agents refused to participate in the firefight any longer; the agents crowded onto the barge farthest from the shore. More experienced agents were barely able to stop the new recruits from abandoning the ships and swimming away. Intermittent gunfire from both sides continued throughout the morning. When the tug attempted to retrieve the barges at 10:50 a.m., gunfire drove it off. More than 300 riflemen positioned themselves on the high ground and kept a steady stream of fire on the barges. Just before noon, a sniper shot and killed another Pinkerton agent. A Pinkerton agent on one of the barges was A.L. Wells, a Bennett Medical College student, who had joined the &quot;expedition&quot; to earn enough money during the summer months. During the fighting, he played a vital role and attended to the injured on the barge.

After a few more hours, the strikers attempted to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill&#x27;s wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water&#x27;s edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00 p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.

===Calls for state intervention===
The AA worked behind the scenes to avoid further bloodshed and defuse the tense situation. At 9:00 a.m., outgoing AA international president William Weihe rushed to the sheriff&#x27;s office and asked McCleary to convey a request to Frick to meet. McCleary did so, but Frick refused. He knew that the more chaotic the situation became, the more likely it was that Governor Robert E. Pattison would call out the state militia.

Sheriff McCleary resisted attempts to call for state intervention until 10 a.m. on July 6. In a telegram to Governor Pattison, he described how his deputies and the Carnegie men had been driven off, and noted that the workers and their supporters actively resisting the landing numbered nearly 5,000. Pattison responded by requiring McCleary to exhaust every effort to restore the peace. McCleary asked again for help at noon, and Pattison responded by asking how many deputies the sheriff had. A third telegram, sent at 3:00 p.m., again elicited a response from the governor exhorting McCleary to raise his own troops.

===Pinkerton surrender===

At 4:00 p.m., events at the mill quickly began to wind down. More than 5,000 men—most of them armed mill hands from the nearby South Side, Braddock and Duquesne works—arrived at the Homestead plant. Weihe wanted to prevent further trouble at Homestead, so he pleaded with Frick to confer with representatives of the Amalgamated to return to Homestead and stop the armed conflict. Weihe urged the strikers to let the Pinkertons surrender, but he was shouted down. Weihe tried to speak again, but this time his pleas were drowned out as the strikers bombarded the barges with fireworks left over from the recent Independence Day celebration. Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, a heater in the plant and head of the union&#x27;s strike committee, then spoke to the crowd. He demanded that each Pinkerton be charged with murder, forced to turn over his arms and then be removed from the town. The crowd shouted their approval.

The Pinkertons also wished to surrender. At 5:00 p.m., they raised a white flag and two agents asked to speak with the strikers. O&#x27;Donnell guaranteed them safe passage out of town. Upon arrival, their arms were stripped from them. With heads uncovered, to distinguish them from the mill hands, they passed along between two rows of guards armed with Winchesters. As the Pinkertons crossed the grounds of the mill, the crowd formed a gantlet through which the agents passed. Men and women threw sand and stones at the Pinkerton agents, spat on them and beat them. Several Pinkertons were clubbed into unconsciousness. Members of the crowd ransacked the barges, then burned them to the waterline.

As the Pinkertons were marched through town to the opera house (which served as a temporary jail), the townspeople continued to assault the agents. The press expressed shock at the treatment of the Pinkerton agents, and the torrent of abuse helped turn media sympathies away from the strikers.
The strike committee met with the town council to discuss the handover of the agents to McCleary. But the real talks were taking place between McCleary and Weihe in McCleary&#x27;s office. At 10:15 p.m., the two sides agreed to a transfer process. A special train arrived at 12:30 a.m. on July 7. McCleary, the international AA&#x27;s lawyer and several town officials accompanied the Pinkerton agents to Pittsburgh.

But when the Pinkerton agents arrived at their final destination in Pittsburgh, state officials declared that they would not be charged with murder (per the agreement with the strikers) but rather simply released. The announcement was made with the full concurrence of the AA attorney. A special train whisked the Pinkerton agents out of the city at 10:00 a.m. on July 7.

William Pinkerton in his testimony before Congress stated that three Pinkerton agents died in the strike—two because of injuries and a third injured agent committed suicide. The total number of Pinkertons, according to the agents themselves, who died was seven and who were wounded was eleven. According to one newspaper report, an agent under cannon fire jumped off a barge and drowned. John Shingle, the captain of the steamboat &quot;Little Bill&quot; was killed. Between thirty-three to thirty-five agents and one crewman of the &quot;Little Bill&quot; were reported in the hospital injured. The total number of captured Pinkertons was 324. A roster of 266 names and 360 Winchester rifles and enough provisions to feed a regiment for a week were also taken from the barges.

==Arrival of the state militia==

On July 7, the strike committee sent a telegram to Governor Pattison to attempt to persuade him that law and order had been restored in the town. Pattison replied that he had heard differently. Union officials traveled to Harrisburg and met with Pattison on July 9. Their discussions revolved not around law and order, but the safety of the Carnegie plant.

Pattison, however, remained unconvinced by the strikers&#x27; arguments. Although Pattison had ordered the Pennsylvania militia to muster on July 6, he had not formally charged it with doing anything. Pattison&#x27;s refusal to act rested largely on his concern that the union controlled the entire city of Homestead and commanded the allegiance of its citizens. Pattison refused to order the town taken by force, for fear a massacre would occur. But once emotions had died down, Pattison felt the need to act. He had been elected with the backing of a Carnegie-supported political machine, and he could no longer refuse to protect Carnegie interests.

The steelworkers resolved to meet the militia with open arms, hoping to establish good relations with the troops. But the militia managed to keep its arrival to the town a secret almost to the last moment. At 9:00 a.m. on July 12, the Pennsylvania state militia arrived at the small Munhall train station near the Homestead mill (rather than the downtown train station as expected). Their commander, Major General George R. Snowden, made it clear to local officials that he sided with the owners. When Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, the head of the union&#x27;s strike committee attempted to welcome Snowden and pledge the cooperation of the strikers, Snowden told him that the strikers had not been law abiding, and that &quot;I want you to distinctly understand that I am the master of this situation.&quot; More than 4,000 soldiers surrounded the plant. Within 20 minutes they had displaced the picketers; by 10:00 a.m., company officials were back in their offices. Another 2,000 troops camped on the high ground overlooking the city.

The company quickly brought in strikebreakers and restarted production under the protection of the militia. Despite the presence of AFL pickets in front of several recruitment offices across the nation, Frick easily found employees to work the mill. The company quickly built bunk houses, dining halls and kitchens on the mill grounds to accommodate the strikebreakers. New employees, many of them black, arrived on July 13, and the mill furnaces relit on July 15. When a few workers attempted to storm into the plant to stop the relighting of the furnaces, militiamen fought them off and wounded six with bayonets. But all was not well inside the plant. A race war between nonunion black and white workers in the Homestead plant broke out on July 22, 1892.

Desperate to find a way to continue the strike, the AA appealed to Whitelaw Reid, the Republican candidate for vice president, on July 16. The AA offered to make no demands or set any preconditions; the union merely asked that Carnegie Steel reopen the negotiations. Reid wrote to Frick, warning him that the strike was hurting the Republican ticket and pleading with him to reopen talks. Frick refused.

==Attempted assassination and collapse of the strike==

Frick, too, needed a way out of the strike. The company could not operate for long with strikebreakers living on the mill grounds, and permanent replacements had to be found. On July 18, the town was placed under martial law, further disheartening many of the strikers.

National attention became riveted on Homestead when, on July 23, Alexander Berkman, a New York anarchist with no connection to steel or to organized labor, plotted with his lover Emma Goldman to assassinate Frick. He came in from New York, gained entrance to Frick&#x27;s office, then shot and stabbed the executive. Frick survived and continued his role; Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison.

The Berkman assassination attempt undermined public support for the union and prompted the final collapse of the strike. Hugh O&#x27;Donnell was removed as chair of the strike committee when he proposed to return to work at the lower wage scale if the unionists could get their jobs back. On August 12, the company announced that 1,700 men were working at the mill and production had resumed at full capacity. The national AFL refused to intervene, the East European workers ignored the union and it had no strategy left. The union voted to go back to work on Carnegie&#x27;s terms; the strike had failed and the union had collapsed.

===Legal battles===
The company had waged a second front in state court, and was winning. On July 18, sixteen of the strike leaders were charged with conspiracy, riot and murder. Each man was jailed for one night and forced to post a $10,000 bond. The union retaliated by charging company executives with murder as well. The company men, too, had to post a $10,000 bond, but they were not forced to spend any time in jail. One judge issued treason charges against the Advisory Committee on August 30 for making itself the law. Most of the men could not raise the bail bond, and went to jail or into hiding. A compromise was reached whereby both sides dropped their charges.

==The strike&#x27;s conclusion==

Support for the strikers evaporated. The AFL refused to call for a boycott of Carnegie products in September 1892. Wholesale crossing of the picket line occurred, first among Eastern European immigrants and then among all workers. The strike had collapsed so much that the state militia pulled out on October 13, ending the 95-day occupation. The AA was nearly bankrupted by the job action. Weekly union relief for a member averaged $6.25 but totaled a staggering $10,000 per week when including 1,600 strikers. With only 192 out of more than 3,800 strikers in attendance, the Homestead chapter of the AA voted, 101 to 91, to return to work on November 20, 1892.

In the end, only four workers were ever tried on the actual charges filed on July 18. Three AA members were found innocent of all charges. Hugh Dempsey, the leader of the local Knights of Labor District Assembly, was found guilty of conspiring to poison nonunion workers at the plant—despite the state&#x27;s star witness recanting his testimony on the stand. Dempsey served a seven-year prison term. In February 1893, Knox and the union agreed to drop the charges filed against one another, and no further prosecutions emerged from the events at Homestead.

The striking AA affiliate in Beaver Falls gave in the same day as the Homestead lodge. The AA affiliate at Union Mills held out until August 14, 1893. But by then the union had only 53 members. The union had been broken; the company had been operating the plant at full capacity for almost a year, since September 1892.

==Aftermath==
The Homestead strike broke the AA as a force in the American labor movement. Many employers refused to sign contracts with their AA unions while the strike lasted. A nationwide 1893 Depression saw prices for steel plunge; other steel companies sought wage decreases similar to those imposed at Homestead.

An organizing drive at the Homestead plant in 1896 was suppressed by Frick. The economy recovered by 1897. In May 1899, three hundred Homestead workers formed an AA lodge, but Frick ordered the Homestead works shut down and the unionization effort collapsed.
De-unionization efforts throughout the Midwest began against the AA in 1897 when Jones and Laughlin Steel refused to sign a contract. By 1900, not a single steel plant in Pennsylvania remained unionized. The AA presence in Ohio and Illinois continued for a few more years, but the union continued to collapse. Many lodges disbanded, their members disillusioned. Others were easily broken in short battles. Carnegie Steel&#x27;s Mingo Junction, Ohio, plant was the last major unionized steel mill in the country. But it, too, successfully withdrew recognition without a fight in 1903.

AA membership sagged to 10,000 in 1894 from its high of over 24,000 in 1891. A year later, it was down to 8,000. A 1901 strike against Carnegie&#x27;s successor company, U.S. Steel, collapsed. By 1909, membership in the AA had sunk to 6,300. A nationwide steel strike of 1919 also was unsuccessful. The AA maintained a rump membership in the steel industry until its takeover by the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1936. The two organizations officially disbanded and formed the United Steelworkers on May 22, 1942.

In 1999 the Bost Building in downtown Homestead, AA headquarters throughout the strike, was designated a National Historic Landmark. It is used as a museum devoted not only to the strike, but also the steel industry in the Pittsburgh area. A railroad bridge over the Monongahela River near the site of the battle is named Pinkerton&#x27;s Landing Bridge in honor of the dead. Two sites were each designated with a Pennsylvania state historical marker: the site where Pinkerton attempted to land, and the two adjoining cemeteries of St. Mary&#x27;s and Homestead where are buried the remains of six of the seven Carnegie Steel Company workers that were killed. The Pinkerton landing site was also named a Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark.

==Modern site==
The pump house where the gunfight occurred remains as a museum and meeting hall. There are several historical markers as well as a metal commemorative sign with the US Steel logo that reads &quot;In honor of the workers&quot;.

<text>The Philadelphia Charge was an American women&#x27;s professional soccer team that played in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association. The team played at Villanova Stadium on the campus of Villanova University near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==History==
In spring of 2000, the newly formed Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA) announced eight cities were granted franchises to start the league, including Philadelphia. Most of the inaugural teams were owned by major media companies, with the new Philadelphia club operated by locally headquartered Comcast Corporation who invested an initial $5 million into WUSA. In November 2000, the club&#x27;s name and logo was officially announced as the Philadelphia Charge and would play home matches at Villanova Stadium. The logo for the Charge incorporated the Comcast Corp. &quot;C&quot; as part of its marketing efforts. The Charge began preparations for the first team with a 15-person front office and was supported by the Comcast-Spector organization for stadium operations, marketing, promotions, tickets, and merchandise.

By late 2000, the Charge had announced that University of Hartford women&#x27;s soccer coach, Mark Krikorian, would be appointed the first head coach of the team. Prior to the start of the season, Krikorian would bring on former Swedish international Pia Sundhage and John Natale as assistant coaches.

The Philadelphia Charge conducting sports performance training at Aspiring Champions in King of Prussia, PA with certified sports trainers, Antonio Davis and Maine Prince. Both attending Penn State University and studied Exercise and Sports Science. Eventually after the team dissolved, Antonio Davis opened The Premiere Sports Academy in King of Prussia, PA. Sports Performance Trainer. Maine Prince, opened Philadelphia Sports Training Center in 2005, with his wife Justina Prince, a 2-time Academic All-American Soccer Player from Moravian University in Bethlehem, PA. The 85,000 square foot sports training facility located in Aston, PA was the premiere sports performance training facility for professional athletes, college athletes, high school athletes, and weekend warriors. Until sold in 2011 for over one billion dollars and is now the largest movie studio in Pennsylvania called Sun Center Studios. Following the sale of the building for Philadelphia Sports Training Center, Maine Prince opened a fulltime sports agency called Prince Management Group. The Philadelphia Charge was the city of Philadelphia&#x27;s most recognizable sports venture conceived by the late, Ed Snider, owner of Comcast (as well as owner of the Philadelphia Flyers and Philadelphia Sixers - at that time).

===2001 season===
The Charge would begin their first campaign led by American forward Lorrie Fair, German defender Doris Fitschen, and English forward Kelly Smith. Finishing the inaugural season in fourth, the Charge advanced to the WUSA semi-final playoff match, losing to Atlanta Beat 3–2.

Building on their first season, the Charge finished second in the standings for the regular season and lead the league in defense with fewest goals conceded (22). This season also featured the signing of Marinette Pichon, who lead the team in scoring and earning Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year awards. Similar to the first season, the Charge lost in the semi-finals, this time to Washington Freedom. Mark Krikorian also won WUSA Coach of the Year honors from the successful regular season.

===2003 season===
The Charge&#x27;s final season featured the team&#x27;s worst record, finishing last (eighth) in the WUSA regular season standings. This season also began the career of future national team goalkeeper, Hope Solo, who made her professional debut in the Charge&#x27;s first win of the season at New York Power.

==Stadium==
The Charged played all their home matches at Villanova Stadium, located in Villanova, Pennsylvania. The 12,500 capacity stadium was the only WUSA stadium utilizing artificial turf. The Charge players, coaches and front office representatives took part in upgraded turf unveiling ahead of the 2002 season.

<doc id="246248" wikidata="Q27287" url="?curid=246248" title="Piperales">
<text>Piperales is an order of flowering plants (4,170 recognized species). It necessarily includes the family Piperaceae but other taxa have been included or disincluded variously over time. Well-known plants which may be included in this order include black pepper, kava, the many Peperomias, pepper elder, lizard&#x27;s tail, birthwort, and wild ginger. The two perianthless families Piperaceae and Saururaceae are mainly herbaceous plants possessing highly reduced flowers.

==Classification==

===APG system===
In the APG IV system, of 2016, this order is placed in the clade magnoliids and is circumscribed as follows:

*order Piperales 
*: family Aristolochiaceae (including Asaraceae, Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae)
*: family Piperaceae
*: family Saururaceae

This is an expansion from the APG system, of 1998, which used the same placement (in the magnoliids) but used this circumscription: 
* order Piperales&quot;
*: family Aristolochiaceae
*: family Lactoridaceae
*: family Piperaceae
*: family Saururaceae

===Earlier systems===
The Cronquist system, of 1981, placed the order in the subclass Magnoliidae of class Magnoliopsida [=dicotyledons] and used this circumscription: 
* order Piperales
*: family Chloranthaceae
*: family Piperaceae
*: family Saururaceae

The Engler system, in its update of 1964, placed the order in subclassis Archichlamydeae in class Dicotyledoneae [=dicotyledons] and used this circumscription: 
* order Piperales
*: family Chloranthaceae
*: family Lactoridaceae
*: family Piperaceae
*: family Saururaceae

The Wettstein system, latest version published in 1935, assigned the order to the Monochlamydeae in subclass Choripetalae of class Dicotyledones. It used the circumscription:
* order Piperales
*: family Piperaceae

In the Hutchinson system the carnivorous Nepenthaceae (now placed in Caryophyllales) and the parasitic Cytinaceae (now placed in Malvales) and Hydnoraceae (now placed in Piperales) are also included. In the Melchior (aka Engler) system Hydnoraceae and Rafflesiaceae (including Cytinaceae) are included in addition to Aristolochiaceae.

<text>San Jose CyberRays was a professional soccer team that played in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association. The team played at Spartan Stadium on the South Campus of San José State University in San Jose, California. Stars included U.S. National Team star Brandi Chastain, WUSA Goalkeeper of the Year LaKeysia Beene, and leading scorer Julie Murray. Other memorable CyberRays were Brazilians Sissi and Katia, Tisha Venturini (from the U.S. National Team), and &quot;ironwoman&quot; Thori Bryan, who played every minute of the first season. They were coached by Ian Sawyers, who received WUSA Coach of the Year honors in 2001.

==History==
===Establishment===

The CyberRays were founded in 2000 as a member of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, the first professional women&#x27;s soccer league in the United States. The league featured many of the stars from the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The team featured United States women&#x27;s national team players and league founding players Brandi Chastain, Tisha Venturini and LaKeysia Beene.

==Year-by-year==

===Inaugural season===

The team won the WUSA title (known as the Founders Cup) for the league&#x27;s inaugural season in 2001. The CyberRays triumphed over the Atlanta Beat, in a 4–2 shootout after double overtime of a 3–3 game. It was the only year in the country&#x27;s history that both a women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s professional soccer team won championship titles in the same city.

===2002===

In 2002 the team changed its name from the Bay Area CyberRays to the San Jose CyberRays, and also gave their roster a facelift, allowing Murray to retire and trading for Pretinha from the Washington Freedom, who along with Katia and Sissi, gave the new attack a decidedly Brazilian flavor. The bold changes didn&#x27;t have the desired effect, however, and the team finished out of the playoffs. One bright spot was the emergence of Katia, who scored 15 goals and broke Tiffeny Milbrett&#x27;s record for most points in a season.

===2003===
The CyberRays had high hopes for 2003, but an anemic offense (worst in the league in goals scored) hurt the team all year. The team remained in contention until the end of the season, but finished out of the playoffs for a second straight year.

But even bigger problems were brewing in the background, as the WUSA continued to struggle financially. The CyberRays folded on September 15, 2003, when the league announced it was suspending operations.


==Stadium==

The CyberRays played at Spartan Stadium on the South Campus of San Jose State University in San Jose, California. The stadium was used for the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup and was also the home of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer from 1996 to 2005. At the time, the stadium featured a grass pitch and up to 30,456 capacity.

==Broadcasting==
In 2002, games were broadcast on television via PAX TV. California Bears assistant coach Jennifer Thomas provided color commentary while KCBS Radio sports announcer Hal Ramey was the play-by-play announcer. A number of league games were broadcast on Turner Sports and CNN/Sports Illustrated.

<doc id="246257" wikidata="Q333560" url="?curid=246257" title="Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke, (21 February 1705 – 17 October 1781) was a Royal Navy officer and politician. As captain of the third-rate , he took part in the Battle of Toulon in February 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession. He also captured six ships of a French squadron in the Bay of Biscay in the second Battle of Cape Finisterre in October 1747.

Hawke went on to achieve a victory over a French fleet at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, preventing a French invasion of Britain. He developed the concept of a Western Squadron, keeping an almost continuous blockade of the French coast throughout the war.

Hawke also sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1747 to 1776 and served as First Lord of the Admiralty for five years between 1766 and 1771. In this post, he was successful in bringing the navy&#x27;s spending under control and also oversaw the mobilisation of the navy during the Falklands Crisis in 1770.

==Early life==
Hawke was the only son of Edward Hawke, a barrister of Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and his wife Elizabeth Bladen, a daughter of Nathaniel Bladen of Hemsworth in Yorkshire, and widow of Col. Ruthven. Hawke benefited from the patronage of his maternal uncle, Colonel Martin Bladen, a Member of Parliament.

Hawke joined the navy as a volunteer in the sixth-rate on the North American Station in February 1720. Promoted to lieutenant on 2 June 1725, he transferred to the fifth-rate on the West Coast of Africa later that month, to the fourth-rate in the Channel Squadron in April 1729 and to the fourth-rate in November 1729. After that he moved to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot; in the Mediterranean Fleet in May 1731, to the sixth-rate in January 1732 and to the fourth-rate , flagship of Commodore Sir Chaloner Ogle, Commander-in-Chief of the Jamaica Station, in December 1732.

After this, Hawke&#x27;s career accelerated: promoted to commander on 13 April 1733, he became commanding officer of the sloop later that month and promoted to captain on 20 March 1734, he became commanding officer of the sixth-rate later that month. The following year he went on half-pay and did not go to sea again until July 1739 when he was recalled to become commanding officer of HMS &quot;Portland&quot; on the North American Station and was sent to cruise in the Caribbean with orders to escort British merchant ships. He did this successfully, although it meant his ship did not take part in the British attack on Porto Bello in November 1739 during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

===Battle of Toulon===
Hawke became commanding officer of the third-rate in June 1743: he did not see action until the Battle of Toulon in February 1744 during the War of the Austrian Succession. The fight at Toulon was extremely confused, although Hawke had emerged from it with a degree of credit. While not a defeat for the British, they had failed to take an opportunity to comprehensively defeat the Franco-Spanish fleet when a number of British ships had not engaged the enemy, leading to a mass court martial. Hawke&#x27;s ship managed to capture the only prize of the battle, the Spanish ship &quot;Poder&quot;, although it was subsequently destroyed by the French. He was then given command of the second-rate in August 1745.

===Battle of Cape Finisterre===

Despite having distinguished himself at Toulon, Hawke had few opportunities over the next three years. However, he was promoted to rear admiral on 15 July 1747 and appointed Second-in-Command of the Western Squadron, with his flag in the fourth-rate in August 1747. He went on to replace Admiral Peter Warren as the Commander-in-Chief, English Channel in charge of the Western Squadron, with his flag in the third-rate , in October 1747. Hawke then put a great deal of effort into improving the performance of his crews and instilling in them a sense of pride and patriotism. The Western Squadron had been established to keep a watch on the French Channel ports. Under a previous commander, Lord Anson, it had successfully contained the French coast and in May 1747 won the First Battle of Cape Finisterre when it attacked a large convoy leaving harbour.
The British had received word that there was now an incoming convoy arriving from the West Indies. Hawke took his fleet and lay in wait for the arrival of the French. In October 1747, Hawke captured six ships of a French squadron in the Bay of Biscay in the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre. The consequence of this, along with Anson&#x27;s earlier victory, was to give the British almost total control in the English Channel during the final months of the war. It proved ruinous to the French economy, helping the British to secure an acceptable peace at the negotiations for the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

===Peace===

For Hawke, however, the arrival of peace brought a sudden end to his opportunities for active service. In December 1747, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the naval town of Portsmouth, which he was to represent for the next thirty years. He was not on good terms with the new First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Anson, although they shared similar views on how any future naval war against France should be waged. In spite of their personal disagreements, Anson had a deep respect for Hawke as an admiral, and pushed unsuccessfully for him to be given a place on the Admiralty board. Promoted to vice admiral on 26 May 1748, he became Port Admiral at Portsmouth serving in that post for three years. He was installed as a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath (KB) on 26 June 1749 and was recalled as Port Admiral at Portsmouth in 1755.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
As it began to seem more likely that war would break out with France, Hawke was ordered to hoist his flag in the first-rate HMS &quot;St George&quot; and to reactivate the Western Squadron in Spring 1755. This was followed by a command to cruise off the coast of France intercepting ships bound for French harbours. He did this very successfully, and British ships captured more than 300 merchant ships during the period. This in turn further worsened relations between Britain and France, bringing them to the brink of declaring war. France would continue to demand the return of the captured merchant ships throughout the coming war. By early 1756, after repeated clashes in North America, and deteriorating relations in Europe, the two sides were formally at war.

===Fall of Menorca===

Hawke was sent to replace Admiral John Byng as commander in the Mediterranean, with orders to hoist his flag in the second-rate HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot;, in June 1756. Byng had been unable to relieve Menorca (historically called &quot;Minorca&quot; by the British) following the Battle of Minorca and he was sent back to Britain where he was tried and executed. Almost as soon as Menorca had fallen in June 1756, the French fleet had withdrawn to Toulon in case they were attacked by Hawke. Once he arrived off Menorca, Hawke found that the island had surrendered and there was little he could do to reverse this. He decided not to land the troops he had brought with him from Gibraltar. Hawke then spent three months cruising off Menorca and Marseille before returning home where he gave evidence against Byng. Hawke was subsequently criticised by some supporters of Byng, for not having blockaded either Menorca or Toulon. He was promoted to full admiral on 24 February 1757.

===Descent on Rochefort===
Hawke blockaded Rochefort in 1757 and later in the year he was selected to command a naval escort that would land a large force on the coast of France. The expedition arrived off the coast of Rochefort in September. After storming the offshore island of Île-d&#x27;Aix, the army commander Sir John Mordaunt hesitated before proceeding with the landing on the mainland. Despite a report by Colonel James Wolfe that they would be able to capture Rochefort, Mordaunt was reluctant to attack. Hawke then offered an ultimatum – either the Generals attacked immediately or he would sail for home. His fleet was needed to protect an inbound convoy from the West Indies, and could not afford to sit indefinitely off Rochefort. Mourdaunt hastily agreed, and the expedition returned to Britain without having made any serious attempt on the town. The failure of the expedition led to an inquiry which recommended the court-martial of Mordaunt, which commenced on 14 December 1757 and at which he was acquitted.

In 1758 Hawke directed the blockade of Brest for six months. In 1758 he was involved in a major altercation with his superiors at the Admiralty which saw him strike his flag and return to port over a misunderstanding at which he took offence. Although he later apologised, he was severely reprimanded. In Hawke&#x27;s absence the Channel Fleet was placed under the direct command of Lord Anson.

===Battle of Quiberon Bay===
In May 1759 Hawke was restored to the command of the Western Squadron. Meanwhile, the Duc de Choiseul was planning an invasion of Britain. A French army was assembled in Brittany, with plans to combine the separate French fleets so they could seize control of the English Channel and allow the invasion force to cross and capture London. When Hawke&#x27;s force was driven off station by a storm, the French fleet under Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans, took advantage of the opportunity and left port.

During a gale on 20 November 1759 Hawke took the risky decision to follow French warships into an area of shoals and rocky islands. The British, unlike the French, had no maps or knowledge of the area, and the French admiral fully expected the British ships to wreck themselves in the dangerous waters. Hawke ordered the master of his ship to follow the French admiral into these waters. The master of the &quot;Royal George&quot;, Hawke&#x27;s flagship, is said to have remonstrated as to the danger of doing so, further compounded by a lee shore. To this Hawke gave his famous reply, &quot;You have done your duty Sir, now lay me alongside the Soleil Royal&quot;. He won a sufficient victory in the Battle of Quiberon Bay, that when combined with Admiral Edward Boscawen&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Lagos, the French invasion threat was eliminated. Although he had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action for the remainder of the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory, asserting that had he had two more hours of daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been captured.

===Blockade of Brest===
Although Hawke&#x27;s victory at Quiberon Bay ended any immediate hope of a major invasion of Great Britain, the French continued to entertain hopes of a future invasion for the remainder of the war, which drove the British to keep a tight blockade on the French coast. This continued to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France&#x27;s economy. After a spell in England, Hawke returned to take command of the blockading fleet off Brest. The British were now effectively mounting a blockade of the French coast from Dunkirk to Marseille. Hawke attempted to destroy some of the remaining French warships, which he had trapped in the Vilaine Estuary. He sent in fire ships, but these failed to accomplish the task. Hawke developed a plan for landing on the coast, seizing a peninsula, and attacking the ships from land. However, he was forced to abandon this when orders reached him from Pitt for a much larger expedition.

===Capture of Belle Île===

In an effort to further undermine the French, Pitt had conceived the idea of seizing the island of Belle Île, off the coast of Brittany and asked the navy to prepare for an expedition to take it. Hawke made his opposition clear in a letter to Anson, which was subsequently widely circulated. Pitt was extremely annoyed by this, considering that Hawke had overstepped his authority. Nonetheless, Pitt pressed ahead with the expedition against Belle Île. An initial assault in April 1761 was repulsed with heavy loss but, reinforced, the British successfully captured the island in June. Although the capture of the island provided another victory for Pitt and lowered the morale of the French public by showing that the British could now occupy parts of Metropolitan France, Hawke&#x27;s criticisms of its strategic usefulness were borne out. It was not a useful staging point for further raids on the coast and the French were not especially concerned about its loss, telling Britain during subsequent peace negotiations that they would offer nothing in exchange for it and Britain could keep it if they wished. 

==First Lord of the Admiralty==
Hawke then retired from active duty, becoming Rear-Admiral of Great Britain on 4 January 1763 and Vice-Admiral of Great Britain on 5 November 1765. He was made First Lord of the Admiralty in the Chatham Ministry in December 1766 and promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 15 January 1768. His appointment drew on his expertise on naval matters, as he did little to enhance the government politically. During his time as First Lord, Hawke was successful in bringing the navy&#x27;s spending under control. He also oversaw the mobilisation of the navy during the Falklands Crisis in 1770 and was then succeeded as First Lord by Lord Sandwich in January 1771.

Hawke was influential in the decision to give Captain James Cook command of his first expedition that left in 1768. When at a meeting in the Royal Geographical Society it was suggested that a civilian should lead the expedition, Hawke is supposed to have remarked that he would sooner have his right hand cut off than allow this to happen. Cook named a series of prominent places that he came across in the &#x27;New World&#x27; after Hawke as a sign of his gratitude.

== Final years ==
Hawke was created Baron Hawke &quot;of Towton&quot; (in which Yorkshire parish was situated his residence of Scarthingwell Hall, inherited by his wife) on 20 May 1776. Towards the end of his life he had his country house built in Sunbury-on-Thames and lived alternately there and at a rented home in North Stoneham, Hampshire. He died at his house in Sunbury-on-Thames on 17 October 1781 and was buried at St Nicolas Church, North Stoneham.

==Cultural references==
His memorial, carved by John Francis Moore and depicting the Battle of Quiberon Bay, is in St. Nicolas&#x27; Church, North Stoneham.

In the Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s 1883 novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, Long John Silver claims that he used to serve in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under &quot;the immortal Hawke&quot;.

Places named after Hawke include:
;Australia
* Cape Hawke in New South Wales.
;New Zealand
* Hawke Bay and subsequently Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region in the North Island.
;Canada

* Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador.
* Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia.

;Royal Navy ships named in Hawke&#x27;s honour
* The 74-gun launched in 1820.
* built in 1891.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1737 he married Catherine Brooke, the only daughter and sole heiress of Walter Brooke (1695-1722) of Burton Hall, Gateforth near Hull and of Gateforth Hall in Yorkshire, by his wife Catherine Hammond (d.1721) daughter and heiress of William Hammond of Scarthingwell Hall, in the parish of Saxton, Yorkshire. Hawke made his home at Scarthingwell Hall and took for his barony the territorial designation &quot;of Towton&quot; from the parish in which it was situated. By his wife he had three sons and one daughter, who survived, and three children who died in infancy.

<text>The Aristolochiaceae () are a family, the birthwort family, of flowering plants with seven genera and about 400 known species belonging to the order Piperales. The type genus is &quot;Aristolochia&quot; L.

== Description ==
They are mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, shrubs, or lianas. The membranous, cordate simple leaves are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. No stipules are present. The bizarre flowers are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical.

== Classification ==
Aristolochiaceae are magnoliids, a basal group of angiosperms which are not part of the large categories of monocots or eudicots. As of APG IV (2016), the former families Hydnoraceae and Lactoridaceae are included, because exclusion would make Aristolochiaceae in the traditional sense paraphyletic.

Some newer classification schemes, such as the update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order Piperales, but it is still quite common, though superseded, for the Aristolochiaceae to be assigned, sometimes with some other families, their own order (Aristolochiales).

== Phylogeny ==
Eight genera are accepted – &quot;Aristolochia, Asarum, Euglypha, Hydnora, Lactoris, Prosopanche, Saruma, and Thottea.

Four assemblages can be distinguished in the genus-level cladogram of Aristolochiaceae:
* &quot;Aristolochia&quot; is closely related to &quot;Thottea&quot;.
* &quot;Hydnora&quot; is closely related to &quot;Prosopanche&quot;.
* &quot;Lactoris&quot; occupies an isolated position.
* &quot;Asarum&quot; is closely related to &quot;Saruma&quot;, and both genera display a deep-branching position in the family.

== Phytochemistry ==
Many members of &quot;Aristolochia&quot; and some of &quot;Asarum&quot; contain the toxin aristolochic acid, which discourages herbivores and is known to be carcinogenic in rats. &quot;Aristolochia&quot; species are carcinogenic to humans.

== Genomics ==

The complete plastid genome sequence of one species of Aristolochiaceae, &quot;Hydnora visseri&quot;, has been determined. As compared to the chloroplast genome of its closest photosynthetic relatives, the plastome of &quot;Hydnora visseri&quot; shows extreme reduction in both size (ca. 27 kilo base pairs) and gene content (24 genes appear to be functional). This Aristolochiaceae species therefore possesses one of the smallest plastid genomes among flowering plants.

== Ecology ==
Pipevine swallowtail butterflies lay their eggs on pipevine (&quot;Aristolochia&quot; species), and the larvae feed on the plant, but are not affected by the toxin, which then offers the adult butterfly protection against predators.

== Fossil record ==
The earliest records of the family are the fossil seeds of †&quot;Aristospermum huberi&quot; and †&quot;Siratospermum mauldinense&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of Portugal and Virginia, United States. The oldest fossil leaf remains are of †&quot;Aristolochites dentata&quot; from the Late Cretaceous of Nebraska. Pollen record of †&quot;Aristolochiacidites viluiensis&quot; has been described from Upper Cretaceous sediments of Siberia. Fossil wood is known from the Deccan Traps of India some 66 million years ago. Leaf fossils of &quot;Aristolochia&quot; are known from the Early and Late Tertiary of North America and the Late Tertiary of Abkhazia, Ukrainia and Poland. Fossil leaf remains of †&quot;Aristolochia austriaca&quot; have been described from Late Miocene sediments of the Pellendorf site at the Vienna Basin in Austria. †&quot;A. austriaca&quot; is most similar to the extant Mediterranean species &quot;A. rotunda&quot; and &quot;A. baetica&quot;.

<doc id="246267" wikidata="Q288266" url="?curid=246267" title="Magnesium sulfate">
<text>Magnesium sulfate or magnesium sulphate is a chemical compound, a salt with the formula , consisting of magnesium cations (20.19% by mass) and sulfate anions . It is a white crystalline solid, soluble in water but not in ethanol.

Magnesium sulfate is usually encountered in the form of a hydrate , for various values of &quot;n&quot; between 1 and 11. The most common is the heptahydrate , known as [[Epsomite|Epsom salt]], which is a household chemical with many traditional uses, including bath salts.

The main use of magnesium sulfate is in agriculture, to correct soils deficient in magnesium (an essential plant nutrient because of the role of magnesium in chlorophyll and photosynthesis). The monohydrate is favored for this use; by the mid 1970s, its production was 2.3 million tons per year. The anhydrous form and several hydrates occur in nature as minerals, and the salt is a significant component of the water from some springs.

==Hydrates==
Magnesium sulfate can crystallize as several hydrates, including:
* Anhydrous, ; unstable in nature, hydrates to form epsomite.
* Monohydrate, ; kieserite, monoclinic.
* Monohydrate, ; triclinic.
* or .
* Dihydrate, ; orthorhombic.
* or .
* Trihydrate, .
* Tetrahydrate, ; starkeyite, monoclinic.
* Pentahydrate, ; pentahydrite, triclinic.
* Hexahydrate, ; hexahydrite, monoclinic.
* Heptahydrate, (&quot;Epsom salt&quot;); epsomite, orthorhombic.
* Enneahydrate, , monoclinic.
* Decahydrate, .
* Undecahydrate, ; meridianiite, triclinic.

As of 2017, the existence of the decahydrate apparently has not been confirmed.

All the hydrates lose water upon heating. Above 320 °C, only the anhydrous form is stable. It decomposes without melting at 1124 °C into magnesium oxide (MgO) and sulfur trioxide ().

===Heptahydrate===

The heptahydrate takes its common name &quot;Epsom salt&quot; from a bitter saline spring in Epsom in Surrey, England, where the salt was produced from the springs that arise where the porous chalk of the North Downs meets the impervious London clay.

The heptahydrate readily loses one equivalent of water to form the hexahydrate.

It is a natural source of both magnesium and sulphur. Epsom salts are commonly used in bath salts, exfoliants, muscle relaxers and pain relievers. However, these are different from Epsom salts that are used for gardening, as they may contain aromas and perfumes not suitable for plants.

===Monohydrate===
Magnesium sulfate monohydrate, or kieserite, can be prepared by heating the heptahydrate to 120 °C. Further heating to 250 °C gives anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Kieserite exhibits monoclinic symmetry at pressures lower than 2.7 GPa after which it transforms to phase of triclinic symmetry.

===Undecahydrate===
The undecahydrate , meridianiite, is stable at atmospheric pressure only below 2 °C. Above that temperature, it liquefies into a mix of solid heptahydrate and a saturated solution. It has a eutectic point with water at −3.9 °C and 17.3% (mass) of . Large crystals can be obtained from solutions of the proper concentration kept at 0 °C for a few days.

At pressures of about 0.9 GPa and at 240 K, meridianiite decomposes into a mixture of ice VI and the enneahydrate .

===Enneahydrate===
The enneahydrate was identified and characterized only recently, even though it seems easy to produce (by cooling a solution of and sodium sulfate in suitable proportions).

The structure is monoclinic, with unit-cell parameters at 250 K: &quot;a&quot; = 0.675 nm, &quot;b&quot; = 1.195 nm, &quot;c&quot; = 1.465 nm, β = 95.1°, &quot;V&quot; = 1.177 nm3 with &quot;Z&quot; = 4. The most probable space group is P21/c. Magnesium selenate also forms an enneahydrate , but with a different crystal structure.

==Natural occurrence==
As and ions are respectively the second most abundant cation and anion present in seawater after and , magnesium sulfates are common minerals in geological environments. Their occurrence is mostly connected with supergene processes. Some of them are also important constituents of evaporitic potassium-magnesium (K-Mg) salts deposits.

Bright spots observed by the Dawn Spacecraft in Occator Crater on the dwarf planet Ceres are most consistent with reflected light from magnesium sulfate hexahydrate.

Almost all known mineralogical forms of are hydrates. Epsomite is the natural analogue of &quot;Epsom salt&quot;. Meridianiite, , has been observed on the surface of frozen lakes and is thought to also occur on Mars. Hexahydrite is the next lower hydrate. Three next lower hydrates – pentahydrite, starkeyite, and especially sanderite – are rare. Kieserite is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps.

==Preparation==

Magnesium sulfate is usually obtained directly from dry lake beds and other natural sources. It can also be prepared by reacting magnesite (magnesium carbonate, ) or magnesia (oxide, MgO) with sulfuric acid ():

Another possible method is to treat seawater or magnesium-containing industrial wastes so as to precipitate magnesium hydroxide and react the precipitate with sulfuric acid.

Also, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (epsomite, ) is manufactured by dissolution of magnesium sulfate monohydrate (kieserite, ) in water and subsequent crystallization of the heptahydrate.

==Physical properties==
Magnesium sulfate relaxation is the primary mechanism that causes the absorption of sound in seawater at frequencies above 10 kHz (acoustic energy is converted to thermal energy). Lower frequencies are less absorbed by the salt, so that low frequency sound travels farther in the ocean. Boric acid and magnesium carbonate also contribute to absorption.

==Uses==
===Medical===
Magnesium sulfate is used both externally (as Epsom salt) and internally.

The main external use is the formulation as bath salts, especially for foot baths to soothe sore feet. Such baths have been claimed to also soothe and hasten recovery from muscle pain, soreness, or injury. Potential health effects of magnesium sulfate are reflected in medical studies on the impact of magnesium on resistant depression
and as an analgesic for migraine and chronic pain.
Magnesium sulfate has been studied in the treatment of asthma,
preeclampsia and eclampsia.

Magnesium sulfate is usually the main component of the concentrated salt solution used in isolation tanks to increase its specific gravity to approximately 1.25–1.26. This high density allows an individual to float effortlessly on the surface of water in the closed tank, eliminating stimulation of as many of the external senses as possible.

In the UK, a medication containing magnesium sulfate and phenol, called &quot;drawing paste&quot;, is useful for small boils or localized infections and removing splinters.

Internally, magnesium sulfate may be administered by oral, respiratory, or intravenous routes. Internal uses include replacement therapy for magnesium deficiency, treatment of acute and severe arrhythmias, as a bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma, preventing eclampsia and cerebral palsy, a tocolytic agent, and as an anticonvulsant. The effectiveness and safety of magnesium sulfate for treating acute bronchiolitis in children under the age of 2 years old is not well understood.

It also may be used as laxative.

===Agriculture===
In agriculture, magnesium sulfate is used to increase magnesium or sulfur content in soil. It is most commonly applied to potted plants, or to magnesium-hungry crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, peppers, lemons, and roses. The advantage of magnesium sulfate over other magnesium soil amendments (such as dolomitic lime) is its high solubility, which also allows the option of foliar feeding. Solutions of magnesium sulfate are also nearly pH neutral, compared with the slightly alkaline salts of magnesium as found in limestone; therefore, the use of magnesium sulfate as a magnesium source for soil does not significantly change the soil pH. Contrary to the popular belief that magnesium sulfate is able to control pests and slugs, helps seeds germination, produce more flowers, improve nutrient uptake, and is environmentally friendly, it does none of the purported claims except for correcting magnesium deficiency in soils. Magnesium sulfate can even pollute water if used in excessive amounts.

Magnesium sulfate was historically used as a treatment for lead poisoning prior to the development of chelation therapy, as it was hoped that any lead ingested would be precipitated out by the magnesium sulfate and subsequently purged from the digestive system. This application saw particularly widespread use among veterinarians during the early-to-mid 20th century; Epsom salt was already available on many farms for agricultural use, and it was often prescribed in the treatment of farm animals that had inadvertently ingested lead.

===Food preparation===
Magnesium sulfate is used as:
* Brewing salt in making beer
* Coagulant for making tofu
* Salt substitute
* A food additive to add taste to bottled water.

===Chemistry===
Anhydrous magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a desiccant in organic synthesis owing to its affinity for water and compatibility with most organic compounds. During work-up, an organic phase is treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The hydrated solid is then removed by filtration, decantation, or by distillation (if the boiling point is low enough). Other inorganic sulfate salts such as sodium sulfate and calcium sulfate may be used in the same way.

===Construction===
Magnesium sulfate is used to prepare specific cements by the reaction between magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate solution, which are of good binding ability and more resistance than Portland cement. This cement is mainly utilized in the production of lightweight insulation panels, although its poor water resistance limits its usage.

Magnesium (or sodium) sulfate is also used for testing aggregates for soundness in accordance with ASTM C88 standard, when there are no service records of the material exposed to actual weathering conditions. The test is accomplished by repeated immersion in saturated solutions followed by oven drying to dehydrate the salt precipitated in permeable pore spaces. The internal expansive force, derived from the rehydration of the salt upon re-immersion, simulates the expansion of water on freezing.

Magnesium sulfate is also used to test the resistance of concrete to external sulfate attack (ESA).

===Aquaria===
Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate is also used to maintain the magnesium concentration in marine aquaria which contain large amounts of stony corals, as it is slowly depleted in their calcification process. In a magnesium-deficient marine aquarium, calcium and alkalinity concentrations are very difficult to control because not enough magnesium is present to stabilize these ions in the saltwater and prevent their spontaneous precipitation into calcium carbonate.

==Double salts==
Double salts containing magnesium sulfate exist. There are several known as sodium magnesium sulfates and potassium magnesium sulfates. A mixed copper-magnesium sulfate heptahydrate was found to occur in mine tailings and was given the mineral name alpersite.

<doc id="246270" wikidata="Q1210921" url="?curid=246270" title="Music of Indonesia">
<text>Indonesia is a country with many different tribes and ethnic groups, and its music is also very diverse, coming in hundreds of different forms and styles. Every region has its own culture and art, and as a result traditional music from area to area also uniquely differs from one another. For example, each traditional type of music is often accompanied by its very own dance and theatre. Contemporary music scene have also been heavily shaped by various foreign influences, such as America, Britain, Japan, Korea, and India. 

The music of Java, Sumatra, Bali, Flores (Lesser Sunda Islands) and other islands have been well documented and recorded,
and further research by Indonesian and international scholars is also ongoing. The music in Indonesia predates historical records, various Native Indonesian tribes often incorporate chants and songs accompanied with musical instruments in their rituals. The contemporary music of Indonesia today is also popular amongst neighbouring countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.

In general, traditional music and songs of Indonesia compromises a strong beat and harmony with strong influence from Indian, Java, Arabic, Chinese and Malay classical music. The influence is strongly visible in the popular traditional music genre of Dangdut.

== Musical instruments ==

The musical identity of Indonesia as we know it today began as the Bronze Age culture migrated to the Indonesian archipelago in the 2nd-3rd century BC. Traditional musics of Indonesian tribes often uses percussion instruments, especially gongs and gendang (drums). Some of them developed elaborate and distinctive musical instruments, such as sasando string instrument of Rote island, angklung of Sundanese people, and the complex and sophisticated gamelan orchestra of Java and Bali.

Indonesia is the home of gong chime, gong chime is a generic term for a set of small, high-pitched bossed pot gongs. The gongs are ordinarily placed in order of pitch, with the boss upward on cords held in a low wooden frame. The frames can be rectangular or circular (the latter are sometimes called &quot;gong circles&quot;), and may have one or two rows of gongs. They are played by one to four musicians, each using two padded sticks to strike them. They are an important instrument in many Indonesian musical ensembles, such as gamelan, kulintang, and talempong.

===Gong===
Gong is a mainly metalic percussion instrument family in various sizes originating from Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, it is usually used by &quot;gamelan&quot; ansambel.

=== Bonang and talempong ===
Bonang is an instrument from gong family in the gamelan device. Talempong is a traditional instrument of the Minangkabau of West Sumatra with shape almost the same as the bonang. Talempongs can be made of brass, but some are made of wood and stone. Talempongs are played by being hit using a wooden rod or a stick. Talempong is usually used to accompany dance or welcoming performances, such as the typical Tari Piring, Tari Pasambahan, Tari Alang, Tari Suntiang Pangulu and Tari Gelombang. Talempong is usually performed with an accordion accompaniment, a type of organ supported and played with the right hand played by the player. In addition to the accordion, instruments such as saluang, gandang, serunai and other traditional Minangkabau instruments are also commonly played with talempong.

=== Kulintang ===
Kolintang or kulintang is a bronze and wooden percussion instrument native to eastern Indonesia and also The Philippines. In Indonesia it is particularly associated with Minahasa people of North Sulawesi, however it also popular in Maluku and Timor. The instrument consist of a row/set of 5 to 9 graduated pot gongs, horizontally laid upon a frame arranged in order of pitch with the lowest gong found on the players&#x27; left. The gongs are laid in the instrument face side up atop two cords/strings running parallel to the entire length of the frame, with bamboo/wooden sticks/bars resting perpendicular across the frame, creating an entire kulintang set called a &quot;pasangan&quot;.

The main purpose for kulintang music in the community is to function as social entertainment at a professional, folk level. This music is unique in that it is considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect from the community and nothing more.
Kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.

=== Angklung ===
Angklung is a bamboo musical instrument native to Sundanese people of West Java. It is made out of bamboo tubes attached to a bamboo frame. The tubes are carved so that they have a distinctive resonant pitch when being vibrated. Each angklung only plays one note.
This musical instrument made of bamboo is played by shaking it. The sound of the Angklung is generated from the impact of bamboo tubes. It has a distinctive sound that vibrates in a composition of 2, 3, to 4 notes in each size.

Angklung existed before the Hindu era in Indonesia. In the days of the Sundanese kingdom (12th to 16th centuries), Angklung became a musical instrument that was always used in various events or celebrations, especially traditional events in farming. At that time, Angklung was played as worship of &quot;Dewi Sri&quot;, namely the Goddess of Rice or the Goddess of Fertility to be given blessings to the plants she planted and also to prosper in life. Not only that, during the Sundanese kingdom, Angklung was also used as a trigger for the spirit of war.

The types of bamboo that are commonly used as musical instruments are black bamboo (awi wulung) and ater bamboo (awi temen), which when dry are whitish yellow. Each note (barrel) is produced from the sound of the bamboo tube in the form of a blade (wilahan) for each bamboo segment from small to large. Each bamboo size has a different pitch. UNESCO designated the &quot;angklung&quot; a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 18 November 2010.

=== Suling ===
Suling is the Sundanese word for seruling the word of Indonesian, which means &#x27;flute&#x27;. Made from bamboo, Indonesian flutes are always end blown and vary in size. The fingering position changes the wavelength of sound resonance inside the suling&#x27;s body. Depending on the distance of nearest hole to the suling&#x27;s head, different notes can be produced. The airflow speed also can modify the tone&#x27;s frequency. A note with twice frequency can be produced mostly by blowing the air into suling&#x27;s head&#x27;s hole with twice speed. Generally, the shorter the suling the higher the pitch. This simple suling produces tunes or melodies that have traditionally been interpreted as the sound of joyful learning. There are many regions in Indonesia that use suling as a traditional instrument and have different local names for it. In Java, Sunda, and Bali, this instrument is commonly called suling, in Minang it is called saluang, in Toraja, it is called Lembang flute, in Halmahera, it is called bangsil, and in West Nusa Tenggara it is called silu. Suling is an Indonesian bamboo ring flute which is used in various traditional musical ensemble performances, including gamelan, gambus, and dangdut. This flute is made of a long, thin-walled bamboo tube called tamiang and a thin rattan band encircles the mouthpiece.

=== Kacapi suling ===
Kacapi suling is a type of instrumental music that is highly improvisational and popular in parts of West Java that employs two instruments, kacapi (zither) and suling (bamboo flute). It is related to tembang sunda. The rhythmic strains of the kecapi are slow in tempo, produced by strings that blend into soft music when combined with the melody of the suling or melismatic vocals. The kacapi is a traditional zither of Sundanese musical instrument derived from the Chinese , and similar to the Japanese &quot;koto&quot;, the Mongolian , the Korean , the Vietnamese and the Kazakh jetigen, and suling is a bamboo flute.

=== Kendang ===
Kendang or Gendang is a two-headed drum used by peoples from Indonesian archipelago. Among the Javanese, Sundanese, or Balinese peoples, the kendang has one side larger than the other, with the larger, lower-pitched side usually placed to the right, and are usually placed on stands horizontally and hit with the hands on either side while seated on the floor. Amongst groups like the Balinese both sides are of equal size, and are played on either one or both sides using a combination of hands and/or sticks. Among the Makassarese, the Ganrang drums have much more importance, with it considered the most sacred of all musical instruments, comparable to gongs in Java.

One of the best known variations of the Kendang is the Gendang beleq. Gendang beleq is a traditional music from Lombok island, Indonesia. The name &quot;gendang beleq&quot; is a Sasak language term, which means &quot;big drum (big gendang)&quot;, as the performance is about a group of musicians playing, dancing and marching with their traditional instruments, centered on two big drum (&quot;gendang&quot;). The drum is made from a wood frame with goat skin drum-head. The wood is selected from woods which is hard yet light. In a Gendang beleq performance, the drummers carry and play gendang and dance a dramatic and confrontational duet. The drummers play interlocking tune with their large drums. Aside from able to play their instruments, the players must have the agility and stamina to perform the dance and marching with their instrument.

=== Sasando ===
Sasando is a plucked string instrument native of Rote island of East Nusa Tenggara. The parts of sasando are a bamboo cylinder surrounded by several wedges where the strings are stretched, surrounded by a bag-like fan of dried &quot;lontar&quot; or palmyra leaves (Borassus flabellifer), functioned as the resonator of the instrument.

=== Tapanuli ogong ===

Musical performance from Tapanuli area of North Sumatra. Tapanuli ogong is a form of dance music played with a type of lute, trumpet and flute.

=== Sape Dayak ===

The sapeʼ (sampek, sampeʼ, sapek) is a traditional lute of the Kenyah and Kayan community who live in the longhouses that line the rivers of East Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and North Kalimantan. Sape&#x27; are carved from a single bole of wood, with many modern instruments reaching over a metre in length. Technically, the sape is a relatively simple instrument, with one string carrying the melody and the accompanying strings as rhythmic drones. In practice, the music is quite complex, with many ornamentations and thematic variations.

== Traditional genres ==

The diverse world of Indonesian music genres was the result of the musical creativity of its people, and also the subsequent cultural encounters with foreign musical influences into the archipelago. Next to distinctive native form of musics, several genres can traces its origin to foreign influences; such as gambus and qasidah from Middle Eastern Islamic music, keroncong from Portuguese influences, and dangdut with notable Hindi music influence.

=== Folk music ===

Indonesian regional folk pop musics reflects the diversity of Indonesian culture and Indonesian ethnicity, mostly use local languages and a mix of western and regional style music and instruments. Indonesian folk music is quite diverse, and today embraces pop, rock, house, hip hop and other genres, as well as distinct Indonesian forms. There are several kinds of &quot;ethnic&quot; pop music, generally grouped together as &quot;Pop Daerah&quot; (regional pop). These include Pop sunda, Pop Minang, Pop Batak, Pop Melayu, Pop Ambon, Pop Minahasa and others. Other than featuring the legacy of &quot;Lagu Daerah&quot; (regional traditional songs) of each regional cultures, the musician might also create some new compositions in their own native language.

=== Gamelan ===

The most popular and famous form of Indonesian music is probably gamelan, an ensemble of tuned percussion instruments that include metallophones, drums, gongs and spike fiddles along with bamboo flutes. Similar ensembles are prevalent throughout Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, however gamelan is originated from Java, Bali, and Lombok.
In the Central Java, gamelan is intricate and meticulously laid out. The central melody is played on a metallophone in the centre of the orchestra, while the front elaboration and ornamentation on the melody, and, at the back, the gongs slowly punctuate the music. There are two tuning systems. Each gamelan is tuned to itself, and the intervals between notes on the scale vary between ensembles. The metallophones cover four octaves, and include types like the slenthem, demung, saron panerus and balungan. The soul of the gamelan is believed to reside in the large gong, or gong ageng. Other gongs are tuned to each note of the scale and include ketuk, kenong and kempul. The front section of the orchestra is diverse, and includes rebab, suling, siter, bonang and gambang. Male choruses (gerong) and female (pesindhen) solo vocalists are common. With the arrival of the Dutch colonisers, a number system called kepatihan was developed to record the music. Music and dance at the time were divided into several styles based on the main courts in the area—Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Pakualaman and Mangkunegaran.

Gamelan from eastern Java is less well-known than central or western parts of the island. Perhaps most distinctive of the area is the extremely large gamyak drum. In West Java, formerly Sunda, has several types of gamelan. Gamelan Degung, gamelan salendro and tembang sunda are three primary types. The Osing Javanese minority in eastern Java are known for social music for weddings and other celebrations called gandrung, as well as angklung, played by young amateur boys, which is very similar to Balinese gamelan.
In Indonesia, gamelan often accompanies dance, &quot;wayang&quot; puppet performances, or rituals and ceremonies. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble. In &quot;wayang&quot;, the &quot;dalang&quot; (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan can be performed by itself – in &quot;klenengan&quot; style, or for radio broadcasts – and concerts presentation are common in national arts conservatories founded in the middle of the 20th century.
Gamelan&#x27;s role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying, &quot;It is not official until the gong is hung&quot;. Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the sultan of Yogyakarta. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the &quot;Gamelan Sekaten&quot;, which is used in celebration of &quot;Mawlid an-Nabi&quot; (Muhammad&#x27;s birthday). In Bali, almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the Catholic church in Indonesia. Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When an &quot;ending&quot; piece (such as &quot;Udan Mas&quot;) is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers, and can be used to ward off evil spirits.

=== Tembang Sunda ===
Tembang sunda, also called &quot;seni mamaos cianjuran&quot;, or just cianjuran, is a form of sung poetry which arose in the colonial-era of Cianjur. It was first known as an aristocratic art; one cianjuran composer was R.A.A. Kusumahningrat (Dalem Pancaniti), ruler of Cianjur (1834–1862). The instruments of Cianjuran are kacapi indung, kacapi rincik and suling or bamboo flute, and rebab for salendro compositions. The lyrics are typically sung in free verse, but a more modern version, panambih, is metrical. It is usually the drums.

=== Jaipongan ===

Jaipongan is a very complex rhythmic dance music from the Sundanese people of western Java. The rhythm is liable to change seemingly randomly, making dancing difficult for most listeners. Its instruments are entirely Sundanese, completely without imported instruments. It was invented by artists like Gugum Gumbira after Sukarno prohibited rock and roll and other western genres in the 1960s.

=== Gambus ===
Gambus literally means &quot;oud&quot;, referring to a type of lute or 12-string pear-shaped guitar, is the Middle-Eastern-derived Islamic vocal and instrumental music. These traditions began to be incorporated throughout many areas of Indonesia by the 16th century.

=== Qasidah modern ===
Qasidah is an ancient Arabic word for religious poetry accompanied by chanting and percussion. Qasidah modern adapts this for pop audiences. It is used to denote a type of orchestra and the music it plays, believed to be introduced by Muslim settlers from Yemen. Qasidah modern were derived from Islamic pop, adding local dialects and lyrics that address Indonesian contemporary issues. Though popular among Arabs in Indonesia, it has gained little popularity elsewhere. One of the oldest qasidah modern musical groups in Indonesia is Nasida Ria.

The contemporary form of Islamic Middle Eastern-influenced music in Indonesia is exemplified by the band Debu, that feature a sufism approach on music to spread their message.

=== Nasheed ===
In Indonesia, as a predominantly Muslim country, many singers perform tradisional or contemporary &quot;nasheed&quot;, a genre of Islamic vocal music, either primarily or in addition to their repertoire.

=== Kroncong ===
Kroncong (alternative spelling: Keroncong) has been evolving since the arrival of the Portuguese, who brought European instruments. By the early 1900s, it was considered a low-class urban music. This changed in the 1930s, when the rising Indonesian film industry began incorporating kroncong. And then even more so in the mid- to late 1940s, it became associated with the struggle for independence.

Perhaps the most famous song in the kroncong style is &quot;Bengawan Solo&quot;, written in 1940 by Gesang Martohartono, a Solonese musician. Written during the Japanese Imperial Army occupation of the island in World War II, the song (about the Bengawan Solo River, Java&#x27;s longest and most important river) became widely popular among the Javanese, and then later nationally when recordings were broadcast over the local radio stations. The song also became quite popular with the Japanese soldiers, and when they returned to Japan at the end of the war re-recordings of it (by Japanese artists) became best-sellers. Over the years it has been re-released many times by notable artists, mainly within Asia but also beyond (like Anneke Grönloh), and in some places it is seen as typifying Indonesian music. Gesang himself remains the most renowned exponent of the style, which although it is seen now as a somewhat starchy and &quot;dated&quot; form is still popular among large segments of the population, particularly the older generation.

After World War II and during Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949) and afterwards, kroncong was associated with patriotism, since many of Indonesian poets and patriotic songs authors uses kroncong and somewhat jazz fusion as the genre of their works. The patriotic theme and romantic wartime romance was obvious in the works of Ismail Marzuki, such as &quot;Rayuan Pulau Kelapa&quot;, &quot;Indonesia Pusaka&quot;, &quot;Sepasang Mata Bola&quot;, &quot;Keroncong Serenata&quot; and &quot;Juwita Malam&quot;. These patriotic songs can be sung in hymn or even in orchestra, but most often was sung in kroncong style known as &quot;kroncong perjuangan&quot; (struggle kroncong). The kroncong divas; Waldjinah, Sundari Sukoco and Hetty Koes Endang, was instrumental in reviving the style in the 1980s.

=== Langgam Jawa ===
There is a style of kroncong native to Surakarta (Solo) called langgam jawa, which fuses kroncong with the gamelan seven-note scale.

=== Gambang kromong ===
Early in the 20th century, kroncong was used in a type of theatre called Komedi Stambul; adapted for this purpose, the music was called gambang kromong. Gambang kromong is quite prevalent in Betawi culture of Jakarta.

=== Tanjidor ===
Tanjidor is a traditional Betawi musical ensemble of Jakarta. The instruments used are almost the same as a military marching band and/or corps of drums/drum and bugle corps, usually consists of tuba or sousaphone, trumpet, clarinet, tambourine and drums. The term tanjidor was derived from Portuguese &quot;tanger&quot; (playing music) and &quot;tangedor&quot; (playing music outdoors), subsequently adopted in Betawi language as &quot;tanji&quot; (music). Other than Jakarta, tanjidor musical ensamble is also can be found in Pontianak, West Kalimantan.

== Contemporary genres ==
The contemporary music of Indonesia is diverse and vibrant. Throughout its history, Indonesian musicians were open to foreign influences of various music genres of the world. American jazz was heavily marketed in Asia, and foxtrots, tangos, rumbas, blues and Hawaiian guitar styles were all imitated by Indonesian musicians. As the result, various genres were developed within Indonesian music frame: Indonesian pop, rock, gospel, jazz, R&amp;B, and hip hop.

Indonesian music also plays a vital role in the Indonesian creative pop culture, especially as the soundtracks or theme songs of Indonesian cinema and sinetrons (Indonesian TV drama). Indonesian film &quot;Badai Pasti Berlalu&quot; (1977) were also produced successful soundtrack hit with same title in the same year, the soundtrack was remade in 1999 with Chrisye as the main singer and rendered by Erwin Gutawa in orchestra style. In 2007 the film was remade again with a new soundtrack that still features same songs performed by younger generation artist. Another popular Indonesian coming of age teen movie &quot;Ada Apa Dengan Cinta&quot; (2002) also produced successful soundtrack hits with most songs written and performed by Melly Goeslaw.

In the late 1990s, within Indonesian popular music, contemporary Islamic songs were emerged, their performers made music as a tool for preaching. The main genres are nasheed (Aa Gym), Islamic rock (Ahmad Dhani and Dewa 19), and fusion style (Cak Nun and Kiai Kanjeng).

Today the Indonesian music industry enjoys nationwide popularity. Thanks to common culture and intelligible languages between Indonesian and Malay, Indonesian music enjoyed regional popularity in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. However, the overwhelming popularity of Indonesian music in Malaysia had alarmed the Malaysian music industry. In 2008 Malaysian music industry demanded the restriction of Indonesian songs on Malaysian radio broadcasts.

=== Orchestra and classical music ===
Western classical music reached Indonesia in the era of Dutch East Indies as early as the 18th century, but it was enjoyed only by a handful of wealthy Dutch plantation owners and officers in elite social clubs and ballrooms such as &quot;Societeit Harmonie&quot; in Batavia and &quot;Societeit Concordia&quot; in Bandung. De Schouwburg van Batavia (today Gedung Kesenian Jakarta) was designed as a concert hall in the 19th century. Classical music has been restricted to the refined, wealthy and educated high-class citizen, and never penetrated the rest of the population during the East Indies colonial era. The type of western-derived music that transcended the social barrier at that time was Kroncong, known as lower-class music.

An amateur group called &quot;Bataviasche Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; was established in Dutch colonial times. It became the NIROM orchestra when the radio broadcasting station Nederlandsch-Indische Radio Omroep Maatschappij was born in 1912. Today it is known as Jakarta Symphony Orchestra that has existed in the country&#x27;s musical world for almost a century through its changing formats to suit prevailing trends and needs. In 1950, a merger of the Cosmopolitan Orchestra under Joel Cleber and the Jakarta Studio Orchestra under Sutedjo and Iskandar appeared as the Djakarta Radio Orchestra under Henkie Strake for classical repertoires, and the Jakarta Studio Orchestra led by Syaiful Bachri specialised in Indonesian pieces. In 2010 Jakarta Symphony Orchestra staged a comeback after a fairly long absence. The Jakarta Symphony was emerged in &#x27;70s.

In the 1960s to 1980s classical music in Indonesia aired mainly by the national radio broadcasting service Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) and the national TV station Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI) through their programs. During these decades, the classical orchestra mainly developed in universities as an extracurricular activity for students which included choir. In the 1990s the group of professional symphony orchestra start to take form, notably The Twilite Orchestra led by Addie MS, was founded in June 1991, initially an ensemble with 20 musicians. The ensemble has developed since then into a full symphonic orchestra with 70 musicians, a 63-member Twilite Chorus, and a repertoire that ranges from Beethoven to The Beatles. The orchestra has played a role in promoting Indonesian music, especially in the preservation of national songs by Indonesian composers and traditional songs. Aided by the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra with the Twilite Chorus, Addie MS re-recorded the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya, by WR Supratman in its original orchestral arrangement by Jos Cleber, as well as other Indonesian popular national songs in the album &quot;Simfoni Negeriku&quot;.

The Indonesian composer who is considered most prominent and well known worldwide in the classical / contemporary music is Ananda Sukarlan (born 1968), with many orchestral works, chamber and instrumental. His most celebrated works are a series of virtuosic Rapsodia Nusantara for piano solo, with musical motifs based on Indonesian folktunes. He has written works for musicians such as from the Boston Symphony Orchestra, violinist Midori Goto etc., and his works are widely performed worldwide

Today, major cities like Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Batam are no strangers to orchestral music, with their own symphony groups. Jakarta, for instance, has its Nusantara Symphony Orchestra, the Twilite Orchestra and the Jakarta Chamber Orchestra.

Indonesia also has many patriotic songs that are used, played, and memorized by the population, some of these national songs are used during the colonial era of the Dutch East Indies, Japanese Occupation, and today Indonesia. Many of these songs have been recorded using orchestral recordings on different albums such as &#x27;Simfoni Negeriku&#x27; conducted by Addie MS.

Among contemporary Indonesian musicians who associated with classical music are: the composers Ananda Sukarlan and Sinta Wullur; the pianists Hendry Wijaya, Eduardus Halim, Esther Budiardjo, and Victoria Audrey Sarasvathi; the flautist Embong Rahardjo; the soprano singers Pranawengrum Katamsi, Aning Katamsi, and Isyana Sarasvati (she is also successful pop sentimental ballad vocalist).

=== Pop ===
Indonesian pop music today, known simply as I-pop or Indo pop (&quot;pop Indonesia&quot;) sometimes influenced by trends and recordings from West music. Although influences ranging from American pop, British pop, and also Asian J-pop are obvious, the Indonesian pop phenomenon is not completely derivative; it expresses the sentiments and styles of contemporary Indonesian life.

Koes Bersaudara later formed as Koes Plus is considered one of the pioneers of Indonesian pop and rock and roll music in the 1960s and 1970s. The American and British music influences were obvious in the music of Koes Bersaudara, The Beatles were known to be the main influences of this band. Several Indonesian musician were survived through decades and become Indonesian music legends, such as pop and ballad singers Iwan Fals and Chrisye, as well as pop and dangdut maestro Rhoma Irama. One of the most influential Indonesian singers in pop music scene, especially during early 2000, is Agnes Monica, who had later known as Agnez Mo.

Indonesian pop music from the 1980s until the 90s&#x27;, known as &quot;Pop kreatif&quot;, are commonly referred to as &quot;Indonesian city pop&quot;, due to their perceived similarities to the Japanese genre. The Japanese city pop and &quot;Pop Kreatif&quot; genre themselves gained popularity among youngsters and amateur musicians in the late 2010s via the Internet.

The most recent foreign influences on Indonesian pop music are influenced from Japanese pop. Several bands such as J-Rocks emulate Japanese pop culture. Girl groups are also spreading among boy bands, such as 7icons and Cherrybelle, as well as JKT48 which is an offshoot of the Japanese AKB48.

=== Rock ===

Just like pop music, Indonesian rock scene also was heavily influenced by the development of rock music in America. The most influential Indonesian rock bands were probably Panbers, God Bless and D&#x27;Lloyd that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. In the late 1980s to mid-1990s several female rock singers popularly known as &quot;Lady Rockers&quot; were famous in Indonesia, such as Nicky Astria, Nike Ardilla, and Anggun who started her career in as a poprock singer in Indonesia before moving to France and pursue her international career. Other notable hard and poprock bands include Slank, Jamrud, Dewa 19, and Peterpan.

Some of Indonesian poprock bands are rekindled with their Malay roots and revived a genre called &quot;Pop melayu&quot; (Malay pop) and popular in the late 2000s. The pop Malay bands include Kangen Band, Wali, Hijau Daun, Armada, Angkasa and ST 12.

Metal bands also exist, such as the metalcore band Killing Me Inside, Death Metal / Grindcore band Jasad and the Groove Metal / Metalcore band Burgerkill. Punk music scene also had steady underground success, with band like Pee Wee Gaskins, Superman Is Dead, and Netral rose to mainstream. Notable act from ska music is Tipe-X.

Dangdut is a popular semitraditional music genre of Indonesia which is partly derived of Indian, Arabic, and Malay music in the late 1960s in Jakarta city. It consists of melodious and harmonical music with the main tabla as the percussion beat especially in the classical dangdut versions. It was originally an Indonesian dance music that has spread throughout Southeast Asia, became the dominant pop style in the mid-1970s. Famous for its throbbing beat and the slightly moralistic lyrics that appeal to youth, dangdut stars dominate the modern pop scene. However dangdut—especially performed by female singers—also often featuring suggestive dance movements and naughty lyrics to appeal the larger audience. This development was strongly opposed by the conservative older generation dangdut artist.

Dangdut is based around the singers, and stars include Rhoma Irama and Elvy Sukaesih (the King and Queen of Dangdut), Mansyur S., A. Rafiq, Camelia Malik and Fahmy Shahab; along with Cici Paramida, Evie Tamala, Inul Daratista, Julia Perez and Dewi Perssik from younger generation.

=== Campursari ===

A musical fusion style of traditional Javanese music and dangdut that prevalent in Javanese cultural sphere, mainly Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java, Perhaps its greatest current artist is Didi Kempot. In the western part of Java, the &quot;Sundanese Dangdut&quot; or Campursari version of the Sundanese was born and developed from traditional Jaipong music with a distinctive drum beat.

=== Experimental music ===
A significant experimental music scene has developed in Indonesia, with many acts combining traditional Indonesian vocal techniques and instrumentation with metal and electronic genres such as gabber and ambient. The experimental band Senyawa has achieved international success with these fusions. Labels such as Yes No Wave in Yogyakarta have been at the forefront of promoting the Indonesian experimental scene.

=== Gospel ===
Gospel music also has a big influence in Indonesia. Gospel music began to enter Indonesia in the 1980s when it was brought in by United States evangelical figures (Evangelical Movement). Gospel music itself experienced its peak of popularity in Indonesia in the 1991s, at which time Franky Sihombing created many Christian spiritual songs. The entry of gospel music into Indonesia was not much sought after by music lovers in Indonesia, but it brought many changes to church music. Currently, many churches in Indonesia use gospel music as a means of their worship. Apart from that, there are also many famous Indonesian gospel musicians who release songs for Indonesian congregations as a means of evangelism and discipleship. Apart from that, there are also many well-known Indonesian gospel musicians such as Joy Tobing, Sidney Mohede, Sari Simorangkir and Franky Sihombing as well as church praise and worship team musicians such as JPCC Worship. Gospel music in Indonesia has now expanded into a whole genre of Christian spiritual music.

In recent years, gospel music has also become increasingly popular among Indonesian people, especially Christians. Gospel music concerts held in Indonesia are always packed with gospel music fans from various circles, especially Christian revival meetings. Apart from that, Indonesian gospel music is also popular in churches in neighboring countries, such as Malaysia, which is common because Malaysian is used in that country as an official language and as a language of instruction for worship, which has similar languages such as Indonesian so it is closely related and in part mutually understandable.

=== Jazz fusion ===
Some of Indonesian musicians and bands were exploring the jazz music. Notable Indonesian jazz musicians include Jack Lesmana, Benny Likumahuwa, Benny Mustafa, Maryono, Bubi Chen Maliq &amp; D&#x27;Essentials. Various other groups fuse contemporary westernised jazz fusion music with the traditional ethnic music traditions of their hometown. In the case of Krakatau and SambaSunda, the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese kacapi suling and gamelan orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars.

=== R&amp;B ===
Currently, contemporary R&amp;B is one of the most popular music genres developed by musicians in Indonesia. Both musicians who already have big reputations and newcomers present their own musical colors which are enough to help introduce R&amp;B more widely so that it can be accepted by various groups of Indonesian society.

=== Hip hop ===

In Indonesia, hip-hop music was generally first introduced by Benyamin Sueb and Farid Hardja. Then, other hip-hop musicians also introduced hip-hop music to the public, such as Iwa-K and other hip-hop musicians.

<doc id="246275" wikidata="Q13676" url="?curid=246275" title="Earwig">
<text>Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short, rarely used forewings, hence the scientific order name, &quot;skin wings&quot;. Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs are found on all continents except Antarctica.

Earwigs are mostly nocturnal and often hide in small, moist crevices during the day, and are active at night, feeding on a wide variety of insects and plants. Damage to foliage, flowers, and various crops is commonly blamed on earwigs, especially the common earwig &quot;Forficula auricularia.&quot;

Earwigs have five molts in the year before they become adults. Many earwig species display maternal care, which is uncommon among insects. Female earwigs may care for their eggs; the ones that do will continue to watch over nymphs until their second molt. As the nymphs molt, sexual dimorphism such as differences in pincer shapes begins to show.

Extant Dermaptera belong to the suborder Neodermaptera, which first appeared during the Cretaceous. Some earwig specimen fossils are placed with extinct suborders Archidermaptera or Eodermaptera, the former dating to the Late Triassic and the latter to the Middle Jurassic. Dermaptera belongs to the major grouping Polyneoptera, and are amongst the earliest diverging members of the group, alongside angel insects (Zoraptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera), but the exact relationship among the three groups is uncertain.

== Etymology ==
The scientific name for the order, &quot;Dermaptera&quot;, is Greek in origin, stemming from the words , meaning , and (plural ), meaning . It was coined by Charles De Geer in 1773. The common term, &quot;earwig,&quot; is derived from the Old English , which means , and , which means , or literally, . Entomologists suggest that the origin of the name is a reference to the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded. The name is more popularly thought to be related to the old wives&#x27; tale that earwigs burrowed into the brains of humans through the ear and laid their eggs there. Earwigs are not known to purposefully climb into ear canals, but there has been at least one anecdotal report of earwigs being found in the ear.

==Distribution==

Earwigs are abundant and can be found throughout the Americas and Eurasia. The common earwig was introduced into North America in 1907 from Europe, but tends to be more common in the southern and southwestern parts of the United States. The only native species of earwig found in the north of the United States is the spine-tailed earwig (&quot;Doru aculeatum&quot;), found as far north as Canada, where it hides in the leaf axils of emerging plants in southern Ontario wetlands. However, other families can be found in North America, including Forficulidae (&quot;Doru&quot; and &quot;Forficula&quot; being found there), Spongiphoridae, Anisolabididae, and Labiduridae.

Few earwigs survive winter outdoors in cold climates. They can be found in tight crevices in woodland, fields and gardens. Out of about 1,800 species, about 25 occur in North America, 45 in Europe (including 7 in Great Britain), and 60 in Australia.

==Morphology==

Most earwigs are flattened (which allows them to fit inside tight crevices, such as under bark) with an elongated body generally long. The largest extant species is the Australian giant earwig (&quot;Titanolabis colossea&quot;) which is approximately long, while the possibly extinct (declared extinct in 2014) Saint Helena earwig (&quot;Labidura herculeana&quot;) reached . Earwigs are characterized by the cerci, or the pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen; male earwigs generally have more curved pincers than females. These pincers are used to capture prey, defend themselves and fold their wings under the short tegmina. The antennae are thread-like with at least 10 segments.

Males in the six families Karschiellidae, Pygidicranidae, Diplatyidae, Apachyidae, Anisolabisidae and Labiduridae have paired penises, while the males in the remaining groups have a single penis. Both penises are symmetrical in Pygidicranidae and Diplatyidae, but in Karschiellidae the left one is strongly reduced. Apachyidae, Anisolabisidae, and Labiduridae have an asymmetrical pair, with left and right one pointing on opposite directions when not in use. The females have just a single genital opening, so only one of the paired penises is ever used during copulation.

The forewings are short oblong leathery plates used to cover the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and in the pattern of folding that requires the use of the cerci.

===Internal===

The neuroendocrine system is typical of insects. There is a brain, a subesophageal ganglion, three thoracic ganglia, and six abdominal ganglia. Strong neuron connections connect the neurohemal corpora cardiaca to the brain and frontal ganglion, where the closely related median corpus allatum produces juvenile hormone III in close proximity to the neurohemal dorsal arota. The digestive system of earwigs is like all other insects, consisting of a fore-, mid-, and hindgut, but earwigs lack gastric caecae which are specialized for digestion in many species of insect. Long, slender (excretory) malpighian tubules can be found between the junction of the mid- and hind gut.

The reproductive system of females consist of paired ovaries, lateral oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber. The lateral ducts are where the eggs leave the body, while the spermatheca is where sperm is stored. Unlike other insects, the gonopore, or genital opening is behind the seventh abdominal segment. The ovaries are primitive in that they are polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate along the length of the ovariole). In some species these long ovarioles branch off the lateral duct, while in others, short ovarioles appear around the duct.

==Life cycle and reproduction==

Earwigs are hemimetabolous, meaning they undergo incomplete metamorphosis, developing through a series of four to six molts. The developmental stages between molts are called instars. Earwigs live for about a year from hatching. They start mating in the autumn, and can be found together in the autumn and winter. The male and female will live in a chamber in debris, crevices, or soil deep. After mating, the sperm may remain in the female for months before the eggs are fertilized. From midwinter to early spring, the male will leave, or be driven out by the female. Afterward the female will begin to lay 20 to 80 pearly white eggs in two days. Some earwigs, those parasitic in the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina, are viviparous (give birth to live young); they would be fed by a sort of placenta. When first laid, the eggs are white or cream-colored and oval-shaped, but right before hatching they become kidney-shaped and brown. Each egg is approximately tall and wide.

Earwigs are among the few non-social insect species that show maternal care. The mother pays close attention to the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection. She faithfully defends the eggs from predators, not leaving them even to eat unless the clutch goes bad. She also continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for only a few days after they are removed, and does not return even if the eggs are replaced; however, when the eggs were continuously replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean the new eggs for up to three months.

Studies have also shown that the mother does not immediately recognize her own eggs. After laying them, she gathers them together, and studies have found mothers to pick up small egg-shaped wax balls or stones by accident. Eventually, the impostor eggs were rejected for not having the proper scent.


The eggs hatch in about seven days. The mother may assist the nymphs in hatching. When the nymphs hatch, they eat the egg casing and continue to live with the mother. The nymphs look similar to their parents, only smaller, and will nest under their mother and she will continue to protect them until their second molt. The nymphs feed on food regurgitated by the mother, and on their own molts. If the mother dies before the nymphs are ready to leave, the nymphs may eat her.

After five to six instars, the nymphs will molt into adults. The male&#x27;s forceps will become curved, while the females&#x27; forceps remain straight. They will also develop their natural color, which can be anything from a light brown (as in the tawny earwig) to a dark black (as in the ringlegged earwig). In species of winged earwigs, the wings will start to develop at this time. The forewings of an earwig are sclerotized to serve as protection for the membranous hindwings.
==Behavior==
Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, living in small amounts of debris, in various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species have been found to be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous, reported to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consists of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species &quot;Doru taeniatum&quot; of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.
Under exceptional circumstances, earwigs form swarms and can take over significant areas of a district. In August 1755 they appeared in vast numbers near Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK, especially in the cracks and crevices of &quot;old wooden buildings...so that they dropped out oftentimes in such multitudes as to literally cover the floor&quot;. A similar &quot;plague&quot; occurred in 2006, in and around a woodland cabin near the Blue Ridge Mountains of the eastern United States; it persisted through winter and lasted at least two years.

==Ecology==
Earwigs are mostly scavengers, but some are omnivorous or predatory. The abdomen of the earwig is flexible and muscular. It is capable of maneuvering as well as opening and closing the forceps. The forceps are used for a variety of purposes. In some species, the forceps have been observed in use for holding prey, and in copulation. The forceps tend to be more curved in males than in females.
The common earwig is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit as well as actively hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the crop.

Species of the suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina are generally considered epizoic, or living on the outside of other animals, mainly mammals. In the Arixeniina, family Arixeniidae, species of the genus &quot;Arixenia&quot; are normally found deep in the skin folds and gular pouch of Malaysian hairless bulldog bats (&quot;Cheiromeles torquatus&quot;), apparently feeding on bats&#x27; body or glandular secretions. On the other hand, species in the genus &quot;Xeniaria&quot; (still of the suborder Arixeniina) are believed to feed on the guano and possibly the guanophilous arthropods in the bat&#x27;s roost, where it has been found. Hemimerina includes &quot;Araeomerus&quot; found in the nest of long-tailed pouch rats (&quot;Beamys&quot;), and &quot;Hemimerus&quot; which are found on giant &quot;Cricetomys&quot; rats.

Earwigs are generally nocturnal, and typically hide in small, dark, and often moist areas in the daytime. They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free-fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice. During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight. Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames, or anything with minute spaces (even artichoke blossoms) can potentially harbour them.

===Predators and parasites===
Earwigs are regularly preyed upon by birds, and like many other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, &quot;Triarthria setipennis&quot;, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, &quot;Ocytata pallipes&quot;, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (&quot;Vespula maculifrons&quot;), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, &quot;Mermis nigrescens&quot;, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, &quot;Histiostoma polypori&quot; (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.

==Evolution==
The fossil record of the Dermaptera starts in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic period about in England and Australia, and comprises about 70 specimens in the extinct suborder Archidermaptera. Some of the traits believed by neontologists to belong to modern earwigs are not found in the earliest fossils, but adults had five-segmented tarsi (the final segment of the leg), well developed ovipositors, veined tegmina (forewings) and long segmented cerci; in fact the pincers would not have been curled or used as they are now. The theorized stem group of the Dermaptera are the Protelytroptera, which are similar to modern Blattodea (cockroaches) with shell-like forewings and the large, unequal anal fan, are known from the Permian of North America, Europe and Australia. No fossils from the Triassic — during which Dermaptera would have evolved from Protelytroptera — have been found. Amongst the most frequently suggested order of insects to be the closest relatives of Dermaptera is Notoptera, theorized by Giles in 1963. However, other arguments have been made by other authors linking them to Phasmatodea, Embioptera, Plecoptera, and Dictyoptera. A 2012 mitochondrial DNA study suggested that this order is the sister to stoneflies of the order Plecoptera. A 2018 phylogenetic analysis found that their closest living relatives were angel insects of the order Zoraptera, with very high support.

Archidermaptera is believed to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are probably no older than late Tertiary.

Some evidence of early evolutionary history is the structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to the frontal cuticle near the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.

==Taxonomy==
===Distinguishing characteristics===
The characteristics which distinguish the order Dermaptera from other insect orders are:
* &quot;General body shape&quot;: Elongate; dorso-ventrally flattened.
* &quot;Head&quot;: Prognathous. Antennae are segmented. Biting-type mouthparts. Ocelli absent. Compound eyes in most species, reduced or absent in some taxa.
* &quot;Appendages&quot;: Two pairs of wings normally present. The forewings are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards.
* &quot;Abdomen&quot;: Cerci are unsegmented and resemble forceps. The ovipositor in females is reduced or absent.

The overwhelming majority of earwig species are in the former suborder Forficulina, grouped into nine families of 180 genera, including &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot;, the common European Earwig. Species within Forficulina are free-living, have functional wings and are not parasites. The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large, forceps-like structures.

The first epizoic species of earwig was discovered by a London taxidermist on the body of a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera. These were subsequently demoted to family Arixeniidae and superfamily Hemimeroidea (with sole family Hemimeridae), respectively. They are now grouped together with the former Forficulina in the new suborder Neodermaptera.

Arixeniidae represents two genera, &quot;Arixenia&quot; and &quot;Xeniaria&quot;, with a total of five species in them. As with Hemimeridae, they are blind and wingless, with filiform segmented cerci. Hemimeridae are viviparous ectoparasites, preferring the fur of African rodents in either &quot;Cricetomys&quot; or &quot;Beamys&quot; genera. Hemimerina also has two genera, &quot;Hemimerus&quot; and &quot;Araeomerus&quot;, with a total of 11 species.

===Phylogeny===
Dermaptera is relatively small compared to the other orders of Insecta, with only about 2,000 species, 3 suborders and 15 families, including the extinct suborders Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera with their extinct families Protodiplatyidae, Dermapteridae, Semenoviolidae, and Turanodermatidae. The phylogeny of the Dermaptera is still debated. The extant Dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for the monophyly of the families Forficulidae, Chelisochidae, Labiduridae and Anisolabididae, however evidence has supported the conclusion that the former suborder Forficulina was paraphyletic through the exclusion of Hemimerina and Arixeniina which should instead be nested within the Forficulina. Thus, these former suborders were eliminated in the most recent higher classification.

==Relationship with humans==
Earwigs are fairly abundant and are found in many areas around the world. There is no evidence that they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. Earwigs have been rarely known to crawl into the ears of humans, and they do not lay eggs inside the human body or human brain as is often claimed.

There is a debate whether earwigs are harmful or beneficial to crops, as they eat both the foliage and the insects eating such foliage, such as aphids, though it would take a large population to do considerable damage. The common earwig eats a wide variety of plants, and also a wide variety of foliage, including the leaves and petals. They have been known to cause economic losses in fruit and vegetable crops. Some examples are the flowers, hops, red raspberries, and corn crops in Germany, and in the south of France, earwigs have been observed feeding on peaches and apricots. The earwigs attacked mature plants and made cup-shaped bite marks in diameter.

==In literature and folklore==
* One of the primary characters of James Joyce&#x27;s experimental novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; is referred to by the initials &quot;HCE,&quot; which primarily stand for &quot;Humphrey Chimpden Earwicker,&quot; a reference to earwigs. Earwig imagery is found throughout the book, and also occurs in the author&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; in the Laestrygonians chapter.
* Oscar Cook wrote the short story (appearing in &quot;Switch On The Light&quot;, April, 1931; &quot;A Century Of Creepy Stories&quot; 1934; &quot;Pan Horror 2&quot;, 1960) &quot;Boomerang&quot;, which was later adapted by Rod Serling for the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; TV-series episode, &quot;The Caterpillar&quot;. It tells the tale of the use of an earwig as a murder instrument applied by a man obsessed with the wife of an associate. 
* Thomas Hood discusses the myth of earwigs finding shelter in the human ear in the poem &quot;Love Lane&quot; by saying the following: &#x27;Tis vain to talk of hopes and fears, / And hope the least reply to win, / From any maid that stops her ears / In dread of earwigs creeping in!&quot;
* In some parts of rural England the earwig is called &quot;battle-twig&quot;, which is present in Alfred, Lord Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Spinster&#x27;s Sweet-Arts&quot;: &#x27;Twur as bad as battle-twig &#x27;ere i&#x27; my oan blue chamber to me.&quot;
* In some regions of Japan, earwigs are called &quot;Chinpo-Basami&quot; or &quot;Chinpo-Kiri&quot;, which means &quot;penis cutter&quot;. Kenta Takada, a Japanese cultural entomologist, has inferred that these names may be derived from the fact that earwigs were seen around old Japanese-style toilets.
*In Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;George&#x27;s Marvellous Medicine&quot;, George&#x27;s Grandma encourages him to eat unwashed celery with beetles and earwigs still on them. A big fat earwig is very tasty,&#x27; Grandma said, licking her lips. &#x27;But you&#x27;ve got to be very quick, my dear, when you put one of those in your mouth. It has a pair of sharp nippers on its back end and if it grabs your tongue with those, it never lets go. So you&#x27;ve got to bite the earwig first, chop chop, before it bites you.

<doc id="246280" wikidata="Q267051" url="?curid=246280" title="Polly Bergen">
<text>Polly Bergen (born Nellie Paulina Burgin; July 14, 1930 – September 20, 2014) was an American actress, singer, television host, writer, and entrepreneur.

She won an Emmy Award in 1958 for her performance as Helen Morgan in &quot;Helen Morgan (Playhouse 90)&quot;. For her stage work, she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance as Carlotta Campion in &quot;Follies&quot; in 2001. Her film work included &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Caretakers&quot; (1963), for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. She hosted her own weekly variety show for one season (&quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;), was a regular panelist on the TV game show &quot;To Tell the Truth,&quot; and later in life had roles in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. She wrote three books on beauty, fashion, and charm. She is also the inspiration behind Mother Goose in &quot;The Land of Stories&quot;.

==Early life==
Bergen was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Lucy (née Lawhorne; 1909–1985) and William Hugh Burgin (1909–1982), a construction engineer. Bill Bergen, as he was later known, had singing talent and appeared with his daughter in several episodes of her 18-episode comedy/variety show &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;, which aired during the 1957–1958 television season to much fanfare. They released a duet Columbia LP, &quot;Polly and Her Pop&quot;.

==Career==

Bergen appeared in many film roles, most notably in the original &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1962) opposite Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. She had roles as the romantic interest in three Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis comedy films in the early 1950s: &quot;At War with the Army&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy,&quot; and &quot;The Stooge&quot;. She was featured in a number of Westerns during the 1950s, including &quot;Warpath&quot;, &quot;Arena,&quot; and &quot;Escape from Fort Bravo&quot;. She starred in the horse-racing comedy &quot;Fast Company&quot;; she starred as the first female commander-in-chief in &quot;Kisses for My President&quot;; and as the wife of James Garner in the romantic comedy &quot;Move Over, Darling&quot;, which also starred Doris Day. Bergen&#x27;s later roles included Mrs. Vernon-Williams in &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;, a John Waters film.

Bergen received an Emmy Award for her portrayal of the true-life title subject in the episode &quot;Helen Morgan&quot; of the 1950s television series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. Signed to Columbia Records, she also enjoyed a successful recording career during this era. She recorded an album in 1957 titled, &quot;Bergen Sings Morgan&quot;, which included the song &quot;Bill&quot;.

In the 1950s, she became known as &quot;the Pepsi Cola Girl&quot;, having done a series of commercials for this product.

She was a regular panelist on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; during its original run. She was an occasional panelist and appeared three times as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. She appeared on the interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. She earned two Emmy Award nominations for her role as Rhoda Henry, wife of Captain &quot;Pug&quot; Henry (played by Robert Mitchum), in two miniseries: &quot;The Winds of War&quot; and its sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;.

Bergen starred in a 2001 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; at the Belasco Theater and received a Tony Award nomination as Best Featured Actress in a Musical. In 2003, she starred at the same theatre in &quot;Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks&quot; opposite Mark Hamill in a role she took over from Rue McClanahan.

In 2004, Bergen played Fran Felstein on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the former mistress of Johnny Soprano and John F. Kennedy. From 2007 to 2011, Bergen had a guest role in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Stella Wingfield, which earned her an Emmy Award nomination.

She was a semiregular cast member of &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; (2006) as the mother of Mackenzie Allen, the fictional president of the United States, played by Geena Davis. Bergen had once played the first female president of the United States in &quot;Kisses for My President&quot; (1964). Another late appearance came in the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation &quot;Candles on Bay Street&quot; (2006), in which she played the assistant to a husband-and-wife team of veterinarians.

In 1965, Bergen created the Polly Bergen Company cosmetics line, also known as Oil of the Turtle. She also created lines of jewelry and shoe brands, and wrote three books on beauty. She had retail stores in Knoxville and Gatlinburg bearing her name.

==Personal life==
Bergen was married to actor Jerome Courtland from 1950 to 1955. In 1957, she married Hollywood agent-producer Freddie Fields, with whom she had two adopted children, Pamela Kerry Fields and Peter William Fields, and stepdaughter, Kathy Fields. Bergen converted from Southern Baptist to Judaism upon marrying Fields. The couple divorced in 1975. She was married to entrepreneur Jeffrey Endervelt in the 1980s.

In 1991, Bergen spoke about having had an abortion, for inclusion in the book &quot;The Choices We Made: Twenty-Five Women and Men Speak Out About Abortion.&quot;

On March 31, 1993, Brandon Lee died accidentally on the set of &quot;The Crow&quot;, and in early April, Bergen held a memorial at her home in Los Angeles with 200 of Lee&#x27;s family, friends, and business associates attended.

Bergen was a liberal-minded, politically active Democrat and feminist. She was an active advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment, women&#x27;s education, and Planned Parenthood. Bergen&#x27;s niece is television producer Wendy Riche.

==Death==
Bergen died of natural causes on September 20, 2014, at her home in Southbury, Connecticut, surrounded by family and close friends. She had been diagnosed with emphysema and other ailments in the late 1990s. Upon her death, she was cremated.

<doc id="246283" wikidata="Q5126034" url="?curid=246283" title="Clara Peller">
<text>Clara Peller (born Rocha Swerdlova; August 4, 1902 – August 11, 1987) was a Russian-born American manicurist and television personality who, already an octogenarian, starred in the 1984 &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; advertising campaign for the Wendy&#x27;s fast food restaurant chain, created by the Dancer Fitzgerald Sample advertising agency.

==Life and career==
Born in Polotsk in Imperial Russia, in 1902, one of eight or nine children born to Wolf Swerdlove (originally Swerdlov/Sverdlov; died 1949) and Yudis (aka &quot;Julia&quot; or &quot;Judith&quot;) Tilkin (or Tilken; died 1952), young Clara spent most of her early life in Chicago. Her father left Russia in February 1906 when he was being drafted for the second time, and after arriving in Boston, Massachusetts, they settled down in Illinois. At age 20, Clara married a local jeweler, William Peller. They had a son (Leslie) and a daughter (Marlene), but later divorced. She never remarried. She worked for 35 years as a manicurist at a Chicago beauty salon, and later moved to the suburban North Shore area to be near her daughter, Marlene Necheles.

At age 80, Peller was hired as a temporary manicurist for a television commercial set in a Chicago barbershop. Impressed by her no-nonsense manners and unique voice, the agency later asked her to sign a contract as an actress for the agency. Though hard of hearing and suffering from emphysema, which limited her ability to speak long lines of dialogue, Peller was quickly used in a number of TV spot advertisements. She first attracted attention as a comical cleaning lady in an advertisement for the new Massachusetts State Lottery game &quot;Megabucks&quot;, and later nationally in a series of commercials for the Wendy&#x27;s restaurant chain.

===Wendy&#x27;s campaign===
First airing on January 10, 1984, the Wendy&#x27;s commercial portrayed a fictional fast-food competitor named &quot;Big Bun&quot;, where three elderly ladies are served an enormous hamburger bun containing a minuscule hamburger patty. While two of the women are commenting on the size of the bun, they are interrupted by an irascible Peller, who looks around in vain for customer assistance while making the outraged demand: &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; Sequels featured a crotchety Peller yelling her famous line in various scenes, such as storming drive-thru counters, or in telephone calls to a fast-food executive attempting to relax on his yacht, the S.S. &quot;Big Bun&quot;.

Peller&#x27;s &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; line instantly became a catchphrase across the United States and Canada. The diminutive octogenarian actress made the three-word phrase a cultural phenomenon, and herself a cult star. At Wendy&#x27;s, sales jumped 31% to $945 million in 1985 worldwide. Wendy&#x27;s senior vice president for communications, Denny Lynch, stated at the time that &quot;with Clara we accomplished as much in five weeks as we did in years.&quot; Former Vice President Walter Mondale also used the line against rival Senator Gary Hart in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1984 campaign.

While hugely popular, the advertising campaign proved to be short-lived, at least for Wendy&#x27;s. Peller had made actor-scale wages — $317.40 per day — for the initial Wendy&#x27;s TV commercial of the campaign in January 1984. Her fee for subsequent work as a Wendy&#x27;s spokesperson was not disclosed, though Peller acknowledged in an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine that she had earned $30,000 from the first two commercials and profits from product tie-in sales. Wendy&#x27;s later stated that the company had paid Peller a total of $500,000 for her work on the campaign, though Peller denied earning that much.

Per the terms of her Screen Actors Guild union contract, the actress was free to participate in any commercials for products, goods or services, which did not directly compete with Wendy&#x27;s hamburgers. She subsequently signed a contract with the Campbell Soup Company to appear in an advertisement for Prego Pasta Plus spaghetti sauce. In the Prego commercial, Peller examines the Prego sauce and after wondering &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; declares, &quot;I found it! I really found it&quot;. However, after the Prego commercial aired on television in 1985, Wendy&#x27;s management decided to terminate her contract, contending that the Prego commercial implies &quot;that Clara found the beef at somewhere other than Wendy&#x27;s restaurants&quot;. In announcing the dismissal, Wendy&#x27;s Denny Lynch stated, &quot;Clara can find the beef only in one place, and that is Wendy&#x27;s&quot;. Peller responded, &quot;I&#x27;ve made them millions, and they don&#x27;t appreciate me.&quot;

Following the conclusion of the &quot;Where&#x27;s the beef?&quot; campaign, Wendy&#x27;s Restaurants entered a two-year sales slump. Vice President Lynch later admitted that consumer awareness of the Wendy&#x27;s brand did not recover for another five years, with the advent of a new, humorous line of TV commercials featuring the brand&#x27;s founder, Dave Thomas.

===Final appearances and death===
Despite the setback with Wendy&#x27;s, Peller continued to make the most of her newfound fame, granting numerous press interviews and making several guest TV appearances. She regularly amused interviewers and friends by claiming not to know exactly how old she was, once telling a frustrated Social Security clerk (who was given three different ages by Peller) that she was &quot;whichever one will get me Social Security.&quot;

On April 14, 1984, Peller made an uncredited cameo appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which was hosted that night by 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She also made an appearance in the low-budget 1985 Neal Israel comedy &quot;Moving Violations&quot;. In Larry Cohen&#x27;s &quot;The Stuff&quot;, she appeared with Abe Vigoda in a commercial. In the &quot;Remote Control Man&quot; episode of the Steven Spielberg show &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, she had a cameo as a disgruntled motorist. On April 7, 1986, she made an appearance at WrestleMania 2 at Chicago&#x27;s Rosemont Horizon, where she was the guest timekeeper for the 20-man invitational over-the top-rope battle royal involving both wrestlers and NFL players of the 1970s and 1980s.

Peller died on August 11, 1987, in Chicago, one week after her 85th birthday, from congestive heart failure. She is buried at Waldheim Jewish Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

Daughter Marlene Necheles published a biography in 2010, &quot;Clara Peller: An American Icon&quot;, then collaborated with Geoff Shell on a musical, &quot;Clara and the Beef&quot;, based on her biography. Peller&#x27;s grandson, who is the son of Marlene, is a pediatrician in Chicago.

<text>Gore-Tex is W. L. Gore &amp; Associates&#x27;s trade name for waterproof, breathable fabric membrane. It was invented in 1969. Gore-Tex blocks liquid water while allowing water vapor to pass through and is designed to be a lightweight, waterproof fabric for all-weather use. It is composed of expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a stretched out form of the PFAS compound polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).

==History ==

Gore-Tex was co-invented by Wilbert L. Gore and Gore&#x27;s son, Robert W. Gore. In 1969, Robert (Bob) Gore stretched heated rods of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and created expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). His discovery of the right conditions for stretching PTFE was a happy accident, born partly of frustration. Instead of slowly stretching the heated material, he applied a sudden, accelerating yank. The solid PTFE unexpectedly stretched about 800%, forming a microporous structure that was about 70% air. It was introduced to the public under the trademark Gore-Tex.

Gore promptly applied for and obtained the following patents:
* , valid from 1976-04-27 to 1993-04-27 for a porous form of polytetrafluoroethylene with a micro-structure characterized by nodes interconnected by fibrils
* , valid from 1980-02-05 to 1997-02-05
* , valid from 1980-03-18 to 1998-06-29 for a &quot;waterproof laminate&quot;, together with Samuel Allen

Another form of stretched PTFE tape was produced prior to Gore-Tex in 1966, by John W. Cropper of New Zealand. Cropper had developed and constructed a machine for this use. However, Cropper chose to keep the process of creating expanded PTFE as a closely held trade secret and as such, it had remained unpublished.

In the 1970s Garlock, Inc. allegedly infringed Gore&#x27;s patents by using Cropper&#x27;s machine and was sued by Gore in the Federal District Court of Ohio. The District Court held Gore&#x27;s product and process patents to be invalid after a &quot;bitterly contested case&quot; that &quot;involved over two years of discovery, five weeks of trial, the testimony of 35 witnesses (19 live, 16 by deposition), and over 300 exhibits&quot; (quoting the Federal Circuit). On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit disagreed in the famous case of &quot;Gore v. Garlock&quot;, reversing the lower court&#x27;s decision on the ground, as well as others, that Cropper forfeited any superior claim to the invention by virtue of having concealed the process for making ePTFE from the public. As a public patent had not been filed, the new form of the material could not be legally recognised. Gore was thereby established as the legal inventor of ePTFE.

Following the &quot;Gore v. Garlock&quot; decision, Gore sued C. R. Bard for allegedly infringing its patent by making ePTFE vascular grafts. Bard promptly settled and agreed to exit the market. Gore next sued IMPRA, Inc., a smaller maker of ePTFE vascular grafts, in the federal district court in Arizona. IMPRA had a competing patent application for the ePTFE vascular graft. In a nearly decade-long patent/antitrust battle (1984–1993), IMPRA proved that Gore-Tex was identical to prior art disclosed in a Japanese process patent by duplicating the prior art process and through statistical analysis, and also proved that Gore had withheld the best mode for using its patent, and the main claim of Gore&#x27;s product patent was declared invalid in 1990. In 1996, IMPRA was purchased by Bard and Bard was thereby able to reenter the market. After IMPRA&#x27;s vascular graft patent was issued, Bard sued Gore for infringing it.

Gore-Tex is used in products manufactured by many different companies.

Gore&#x27;s patents on ePTFE based fabric expired in 1997 and ePTFE membrane waterproof fabrics have become available from other brands.

For his invention, Robert W. Gore was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.

In 2015, Gore was ordered by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to pay Bard $1 billion in damages. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Federal Circuit&#x27;s decision.

== Structure ==
ePTFE has a porous microstructure composed of long, narrow fibrils that intersect at nodes. Increasing the processing temperature or increasing the strain rate leads to more homogenous expansion with more spherically symmetric pores and more intersections between fibrils. The formation of ePTFE is enabled by the unwinding of PTFE molecules to create large pores within the structure. This favors highly ordered, crystalline PTFE that allows the molecules to disentangle more easily and uniformly when stretched. The porosity is largely determined by the stretching temperature and rate. Changing the stretching rate from 4.8 m/min to 8m/min can increase the porosity from 60.4% to 70.8%.

== Properties ==
Due to the high work hardening rate of PTFE, ePTFE is significantly stronger than the unstretched material. On a microscopic level, this work hardening corresponds to the increasing crystallinity of PTFE as the fibrils untangle and orient upon the application of an external stress. ePTFE has a strikingly high ultimate tensile strength (50–800 MPa) relative to its full-density counterpart (20–30 MPa) as a result of its high crystallinity. This behavior also yields a negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio due to the expansion of ePTFE along all directions, contrasting the more expected reduction in the directions perpendicular to the stress in cases with volume conservation.

ePTFE has tunable porosity based on the processing conditions and can be made permeable to certain vapors and gases. However, it is impermeable to most liquids, including water, a property that is exploited in certain applications such as raincoats. These additional properties in combination with the inherent properties of PTFE-based materials more generally (chemical inertness, thermal stability) make ePTFE a versatile material for a range of applications.

== Processing ==
The most common process used to produce large sheets of ePTFE at scale is a tape stretching process through the following steps:

# A lubricating agent (often an oil) is added to fine PTFE powder until a paste is formed. 
# The paste is extruded into a sheet that is calendered to obtain a specific, uniform thickness.
# The PTFE sheet passes through an oven set to an elevated temperature (often around 300C) while simultaneously undergoing an applied stress that dramatically stretches the material. While heating during this step is not necessary for expansion, it improves the uniformity of expansion.
# The ePTFE is sintered to increase its strength. This typically involves heating it to a temperature just above the melting temperature of unexpanded PTFE (340C) so that molecules can diffuse across the boundaries between grains in the material. This reduces the gaps in the ePTFE that might have formed during the stretching step.

Factors such as strain rate, oven temperature, sintering time, and sintering duration can affect the specific properties of the resulting ePTFE sheet which can be tailored to match particular applications.

==Environmental and health concerns==
PTFE is a fluoropolymer made using an emulsion polymerization process that utilizes the fluorosurfactant PFOA, a persistent environmental contaminant. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified PFOA as &quot;carcinogenic to humans.&quot;

Gore pledged in 2017 to eliminate PFCs such as PFOA by 2023, although the core technology will continue to be based on PTFE, which is a PFAS compound. Many Gore-Tex products have a durable water repellent coating and the version that do not contain PFCs of environmental concerns are marketed as &quot;Gore PFCEC Free DWR&quot;. Unlike the &quot;Gore DWR&quot;, it lacks any form of oil repellency.

From 2024 onwards, the company is replacing ePTFE membrane with an expanded polyethylene (ePE) membrane in consumer fabrics. The new material, while intended to perform comparably to the existing ePTFE material, will cost more, and require more frequent washing.

=== Pollution lawsuit ===
In 2023, two lawsuits have been filed against Gore on the matter of PFAS related water pollution around its Cecil County, Maryland manufacturing plant and the Maryland Department of the Environment has ordered an investigation and residents in the monitoring area have been offered bottled water. One of the lawsuits alleges that the company knew about the dangers of PFOA/PFAS since the 1990s.

A lawsuit was filed by the state of Maryland in December 2024, focusing on liability for pollution left by thirteen Gore-Tex manufacturing facilities in the northeastern part of the state.

==Applications==
Gore-Tex materials are typically based on thermo-mechanically expanded PTFE and other fluoropolymer products. They are used in a wide variety of applications such as high-performance fabrics, medical implants, filter media, insulation for wires and cables, gaskets, and sealants. However, Gore-Tex fabric is best known for its use in protective, yet breathable, rainwear.

=== Use in rainwear ===
Before the introduction of Gore-Tex, the simplest sort of rainwear would consist of a two-layer sandwich, where the outer layer would typically be woven nylon or polyester to provide strength. The inner one would be polyurethane (abbreviated: PU) to provide water resistance, at the cost of breathability.

Early Gore-Tex fabric replaced the inner layer of non-breathable PU with a thin, porous fluoropolymer membrane (Teflon) coating that is bonded to a fabric. This membrane had about 9 billion pores per square inch (around 1.4 billion pores per square centimeter). Each pore is approximately the size of a water droplet, making it impenetrable to liquid water while still allowing the more volatile water vapor molecules to pass through.

The outer layer of Gore-Tex fabric is coated on the outside with a Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatment. The DWR prevents the main outer layer from becoming wet, which would reduce the breathability of the whole fabric. However, the DWR is not responsible for the jacket being waterproof. Without the DWR, the Gore-Tex layer would become soaked, thus preventing any breathability, and the wearer&#x27;s sweat being produced on the inside would fail to evaporate, leading to dampness there. This might give the appearance that the fabric is leaking when it is not. Wear and cleaning will reduce the performance of Gore-Tex fabric by wearing away this Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatment. The DWR can be reinvigorated by tumble drying the garment or ironing on a low setting.

Gore requires that all garments made from their material have taping over the seams, to eliminate leaks. Gore&#x27;s sister product, Windstopper, is similar to Gore-Tex in being windproof and breathable, and it can stretch, but it is not waterproof. The Gore naming system does not imply any specific technology or material but instead implies a specific set of performance characteristics.

=== Use in other clothing ===
Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is used in clothing due to its breathability and water protection capabilities. Besides use in rainwear ePTFE can now be found in space suits.

=== Other uses ===
Gore-Tex is also used internally in medical applications, because it is nearly inert inside the body. Specifically, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE) can take the form of a fabric-like mesh. Implementing and applying the mesh form in the medical field is a promising type of technological material feature. In addition, the porosity of Gore-Tex permits the body&#x27;s own tissue to grow through the material, integrating grafted material into the circulation system. Gore-Tex is used in a wide variety of medical applications, including sutures, vascular grafts, heart patches, and synthetic knee ligaments, which have saved thousands of lives. In the form of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE), Gore-Tex has been shown to be a reliable synthetic, medical material in treating patients with nasal dorsal interruptions. In more recent observations, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (E-PTFE) has recently been used as membrane implants for glaucoma surgery.

Gore-Tex has been used for many years in the conservation of illuminated manuscripts.

Explosive sensors have been printed on Gore-Tex clothing leading to the sensitive voltametric detection of nitroaromatic compounds.

The &quot;Gore-Tex&quot; brand name was formerly used for industrial and medical products.

Gore-Tex has been used since the 1980s to make bagpipe (woodwind instrument) bags as an alternative to bags made of animal hides as it was able to hold air while allowing moisture to escape, and did not degrade with exposure to water.

<text>Dorsey William Burnett Jr. (December 28, 1932 – August 19, 1979) was an American early rockabilly singer. With his younger brother Johnny Burnette and a friend named Paul Burlison, he was a founding member of The Rock and Roll Trio. He is also the father of country musician and former Fleetwood Mac member Billy Burnette.

==Background and early career==
Dorsey William Burnett Jr. was born on December 28, 1932, to Willie Mae and Dorsey William Burnett Sr. in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. The &#x27;e&#x27; at the end of his surname was added later. His younger brother, John Joseph &quot;Johnny&quot; Burnett, was born on March 25, 1934. The family lived in a public housing project in the Lauderdale Courts area of Memphis, Tennessee.

Dorsey was a competent athlete with an interest in boxing. Both of the Burnette brothers turned out to be successful amateur boxers, becoming local Golden Gloves champions. In 1949, Dorsey was introduced to another young boxing contender named Paul Burlison by Jimmy Denson, his boxing teacher, and they were to become friends. Later, Burlison was introduced to Johnny Burnette, and they also became friends. All three men had a mutual interest in music. Burlison had begun to receive guitar lessons when he was eight years old. In 1939, Dorsey Sr. gave his two sons a pair of Gene Autry guitars. According to most sources, the brothers immediately broke them over each other&#x27;s head. Dorsey Sr. then bought them two more guitars. Dorsey later recalled that their father had said &quot;Learn to play those guitars. You can be like those folks on the Grand Ole Opry if you want to.&quot; Dorsey said that &quot;he learned the G, C and E chords and when the strings broke, he would use baling wire&quot;.

After graduating from a Catholic high school in Memphis, Dorsey became a professional boxer before working at a number of daytime jobs, which included a cotton picker, an oiler on a Mississippi riverboat, a fisherman, a carpet layer. He was finally to work at the Crown Electric Company with Paul Burlison as an apprentice electrician and would spend six years studying for an electrician&#x27;s license. Johnny Burnette also worked as a deck hand on barges, which traversed the Mississippi River and though they worked separately, each of them would bring his guitar on board and write songs during his spare time. After work, they would perform those and other songs together at local bars with a varying array of sidemen. Paul Burlison joined them after his discharge from the United States Armed Forces, and in 1952 or 1953, they formed a group, which may have been called The Rhythm Rangers at the time. Johnny Burnette sang the vocals and played acoustic guitar, Dorsey played bass, and Paul Burlison played lead guitar.

==The Rock and Roll Trio==
For economic reasons, in 1956, the three young men moved to New York City, where they got an audition with Ted Mack on &quot;The Original Amateur Hour&quot;. They won the competition three times in a row, which gained them a place in the finals and a recording contract with Coral Records and they officially became The Rock and Roll Trio. Promotional appearances were arranged on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; and Perry Como&#x27;s Kraft Music Hall, together with a summer tour with Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent. On September 9, 1956, they appeared as finalists in the Ted Mack Original Amateur Hour at Madison Square Garden. Despite all of this activity, however, the three singles released over this period failed to make the national charts.

To cover their living expenses, the Trio was forced to go on the road. This exhausting regime led to squabbles, which were exacerbated in Dorsey&#x27;s case by Jerome&#x27;s use of the name Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio on records and live dates. Things finally came to a head at a gig in Niagara Falls in the fall of 1956, when as a result of a fight, Dorsey quit the group a week before they were to appear in Alan Freed&#x27;s film &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;. Johnny Burnette and Paul Burlison recruited Johnny Black, the brother of Elvis Presley&#x27;s bassist Bill Black, to fill Dorsey&#x27;s place, and the Trio completed their spot in the film. Despite the film appearance and three more single releases and one LP release, the group failed to achieve any chart success, and the Trio officially disbanded in the fall of 1957. 

==Move to California==
Colin Escott of &quot;Showtime Magazine&quot; states that during or after his stint with his own trio, Dorsey recorded a demo session with Fabor Robinson (owner of Fabor Records, co-owner of Abbott Records and sometime manager of Johnny Horton and Jim Reeves). French researchers Giles Vignal and Marc Alesina place the demo session at the Sun Records Studio in November 1956, and they have Dorsey&#x27;s being backed by Johnny Burnette and Paul Burlison. &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot; and four other tracks were cut, but all are believed to be lost. On November 24, 1956, Dorsey went to a session at the Fabor Studio in Malibu, California, where he cut four tracks: &quot;The Devil Queen&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;At a Distance&quot; and &quot;Jungle Magic&quot;. These tracks were released as two singles: &quot;Let&#x27;s Fall in Love/The Devil&#x27;s Queen&quot; (Abbott 188–45) on November 24, 1956, and &quot;Jungle Magic/At a Distance&quot; (Abbott 190–45) on February 23, 1957. Fabor Robinson offered to place Dorsey on either the Louisiana Hayride or the Town Hall Party (the West Coast&#x27;s leading showcase for country music).

After moving to California, Dorsey found work as an electrician to make ends meet and began writing songs in his spare time. Once he had become settled, Dorsey sent for his family. By the fall of 1957, Johnny Burnette was unemployed, and he tried his luck on the West Coast. With a friend, Joe Campbell, he hitched a ride in a railroad boxcar to Los Angeles, where they joined Dorsey. With their past differences forgotten, the brothers attempted to resurrect The Rock and Roll Trio by sending for Paul Burlison. He briefly joined them, but returned to Memphis and concentrated on his electrical business. Dorsey continued with his day job as an electrician to pay the family expenses, and he and Johnny continued with their song-writing activities in their spare time.

==The Burnette Brothers==
In November 1957, the brothers were approached by songwriter John Marascalco, who had written &quot;Ready Teddy&quot; and &quot;Rip It Up&quot; for Little Richard as well as &quot;Good Night My Love&quot;. He was looking for a singer to help him with &quot;Bertha Lou&quot;, a new song. Dorsey and Johnny went into the Master Recorders Studio in Hollywood and backed by Odell Hull (lead guitar), Danny Flores (piano) and H.B. Barnum (drums) cut two tracks: &quot;Bertha Lou&quot; and &quot;‘Till The Law Says Stop&quot;. It originally was planned that Johnny should sing the lead vocals, but when he recalled that he was still under contract to Coral Records, Dorsey suggested that nobody would care if he sang the song. The vocal duties were switched, with Johnny singing some of the backing vocals. The two sides were released as a single (Surf SR5019-45) under Dorsey&#x27;s name. Coral threatened to sue, and so label owner Kenny Babcock withdrew the record. Babcock had Dorsey&#x27;s voice overdubbed with that of Johnny Faire (also known as John Faircloth). Surf SR5019-45 was subsequently re-released as by Johnny Faire. Johnny Faire later changed his name and found fame as Donnie Brooks.

The songwriting credits show John Marascalco as the writer of &quot;Bertha Lou&quot;, but Cub Koda reports Brooks as saying that the song was in fact written by Johnny Burnette, who, as part of the recording deal, sold it to Marascalco. John Marascalco later was persuaded to release Dorsey&#x27;s version, which he still owned. In 1965, &quot;Bertha Lou&quot;/&quot;Keep a Knockin’&quot; was released as Cee-Jam No. 6 with &quot;Bertha Lou&quot; under the name of Dorsey Burnette. The flipside &quot;Keep a Knockin’&quot; was released under the name The Brothers. In 1966, &quot;Bertha Lou&quot;/&quot;’Til The Law Says Stop&quot; was released as Cee-Jam No. 16 with both sides under the name Dorsey Burnette.

It was sheer bravado that enabled the Burnette Brothers to have their first major breakthrough as songwriters. On arriving in Los Angeles, Joe Campbell bought a copy of &quot;A Map to the Stars&quot;, which showed the location of the then teen idol Ricky Nelson&#x27;s home. In an effort to get their songs to him, the Burnettes and Campbell sat on the steps of the star&#x27;s home until they could get a meeting with him. This persistence worked, and Nelson was impressed with their work, and he recorded &quot;Believe What You Say&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; and &quot;Waitin&#x27; in School&quot;. Other artists on Imperial Records, Nelson&#x27;s label, such as Roy Brown, who covered the brothers&#x27; &quot;Hip Shakin&#x27; Baby&quot;, benefited from their songwriting abilities, and this led to their signing a recording contract with Imperial.

As the Burnette Brothers, Dorsey and Johnny had a single release on the Imperial label, &quot;Warm Love&quot;/&quot;My Honey&quot; (Imperial X5509), released on May 5, 1958. It did not make the charts. In 1961, they had two instrumentals releases on the small Infinity and Gothic labels. The first single &quot;Green Grass of Texas&quot;/&quot;Bloody River&quot; (Infinity INX-001) was released on February 20, 1961. The second single &quot;Rockin&#x27; Johnny Home&quot;/&quot;Ole Reb&quot; (Gothic GOX-001) was released on May 29, 1961. Both singles were released under the name The Texans. Another instrumental, &quot;Lonely Island&quot;/&quot;Green Hills&quot; (Liberty 55460), under the name The Shamrocks, appeared on Liberty Records on June 6, 1962. &quot;Green Grass of Texas&quot;/&quot;Bloody River&quot; was re-released in February 1965 on the Vee-Jay label (VJ 658), again under the name of The Texans. 

==Solo career==
===Pop years===
Dorsey Burnette had two single releases while contracted to Imperial Records as a solo artist: &quot;You Came as a Miracle&quot;/&quot;Try&quot; (Imperial X5561), released on March 9, 1959, and &quot;Lonely Train&quot;/&quot;Misery&quot; (Imperial X 5597), released on September 7, 1959. Neither record was a hit. In late 1959, Dorsey offered &quot;Tall Oak Tree&quot; to Ricky Nelson, who turned it down. Now signed to Era Records, Dorsey recorded the song himself, and it was released on January 11, 1960, backed with &quot;Juarez Town&quot; (Era 3012). The record entered the charts and reached No. 23 on the Hot 100. He was the first of the Burnette Brothers to have a hit record. This success spurred Coral Records to dig into their archives and release two old Rock and Roll Trio recordings as &quot;Blues Stay Away from Me&quot;/&quot;Midnight Train&quot; (Coral 9–62190). The top side was released under the name Dorsey Burnette, but the flip side was under the names Dorsey and Johnny Burnette. It did not make the charts. On May 2, 1960, Era released a follow-up record, &quot;Hey Little One&quot;/&quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; (Era 3019), by Dorsey and it reached No. 48 in the Hot 100. Two days later on May 4, 1960, &quot;Dreamin’&quot;, Johnny Burnette&#x27;s first major solo hit record, was released on Liberty Records. On May 23, 1960, Imperial Records followed Coral&#x27;s example and released &quot;Way in the Middle of the Night&quot;/&quot;Your Love&quot; (Imperial X 5668) under the name Dorsey Burnette, but it failed to make the charts.

&quot;The Ghost of Billy Malloo&quot;/&quot;Red Roses&quot; (Era 3025), Dorsey Burnette&#x27;s third single on the Era Label, was released on August 29, 1960, but unlike its predecessors, it failed to enter the charts. His final release for the Era label that year was &quot;This Hotel&quot;/&quot;The River and the Mountain&quot; (Era 3033), released on November 7, 1960, but it also failed to become a hit. In 1961, he had two single releases on Era Records: &quot;Hard Rock Mine&quot;/&quot;(It&#x27;s No) Sin&quot; (Era 3041), released February 27, 1961, and &quot;Great Shakin&#x27; Fever&quot;/&quot;That&#x27;s Me Without You&quot; (Era 3045) released April 24, 1961. These singles failed to become hits, and in May 1961, Herb Newman of Era Records sold Dorsey&#x27;s contract together with the masters of his last two Era recording sessions to Dot Records (its biggest recording artist at that time was Pat Boone). 

Dorsey had three singles released during his time with Dot. The first was &quot;Rainin&#x27;&quot;/&quot;A Full House&quot; (Dot 45–16230), released May 1961; followed by &quot;Feminine Touch&quot;/&quot;Sad Boy&quot; (Dot 45–16265), released September 25, 1961; and finally &quot;Dying Ember&quot;/&quot;A Country Boy in the Army&quot; (Dot 45–16305) released January 1962. None of these releases caught the public&#x27;s ear, and he was released at the end of his six-month contract. From here, he moved to Reprise Records, the label owned at that time by Frank Sinatra. At Reprise, Dorsey worked with producer Jimmy Bowen and arranger Jack Nitzsche and had two single releases in 1962. &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;/&quot;The Boys Kept Hangin&#x27; Around&quot; (Reprise R-20,093) was released on June 30, 1962, and &quot;I&#x27;m Waitin&#x27; for Ya Baby&quot;/&quot;Darling Jane&quot; (Reprise R-20,121) was released October 27, 1962. Neither single was a hit. During 1963, he had four singles releases on Reprise. The first was &quot;Foolish Pride&quot;/&quot;Four For Texas&quot; (Reprise R-20,146) released February 23, 1963; followed by &quot;Hey Sue&quot;/&quot;It Don&#x27;t Take Much&quot; (Reprise R-20,153), released March 9, 1963; then &quot;Invisible Chains/Pebbles&quot; (Reprise R-20,177), released May 9, 1963. His final release was &quot;Where&#x27;s the Lonely Girl?&quot;/&quot;One of the Lonely&quot; (Reprise R-20,208) released August 24, 1963. To coincide with this single, Imperial released &quot;Circle Rock&quot;/&quot;House with a Tin Roof Top&quot; (Imperial 5987) in August 1963. None of these singles reached the charts, and so he moved to the Mel-O-Dy label, a subsidiary of Motown Records. The label&#x27;s early releases were soul-oriented and included tracks by Lamont Dozier, The Vells (Martha and the Vandellas) and The Pirates (The Temptations).

The single &quot;The Greatest Love&quot;/&quot;Thin Little, Simple Little, Plain Little Girl&quot; (Liberty 56087) was released in late 1968 and was in &quot;hitbound&quot; status on some radio stations as of December 25, 1968.

===Johnny Burnette&#x27;s death===
Three months later Dorsey Burnette suffered a family tragedy from which, according to most sources, he never fully recovered. On August 14, 1964, his brother Johnny had gone on a fishing trip on Clear Lake, California. After dark, his tiny, unlit fishing boat was struck by an unaware cabin cruiser, and the impact threw him into the lake where he drowned. Dorsey was distraught, and he telephoned Paul Burlison, who immediately flew to comfort him. The two men renewed their friendship, and Johnny Burnette was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. His last two Mel-O-Dy singles, &quot;Jimmy Brown&quot;/&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Angel&quot; (Mel-O-Dy 116) released October 1964 and &quot;Long Long Time Ago&quot;/&quot;Ever Since the World Began&quot; (Mel-O-Dy 118), released in November 1964, failed to make the charts. The label was discontinued in April 1965, and from then on, Dorsey recorded without luck on a series of labels, including Liberty, Merri, Happy Tiger, Music Factory, Smash (where he re-recorded &quot;Tall Oak Tree&quot;), Mercury, Hickory and Condor, which released &quot;The Magnificent Sanctuary Band&quot;/&quot;Can&#x27;t You See It Happening&quot; (Condor FF-1005) on February 7, 1970.

===Country years===
By the 1970s Dorsey had become a born-again Christian and had returned to country material. He found success on the country charts with self-penned songs such as &quot;In the Spring (The Roses Always Turn Red)&quot; (Capitol 3307; 1972; No. 21), &quot;I Just Couldn&#x27;t Let Her Walk Away&quot; (Capitol 3404; 1972; No. 40), &quot;Darlin’&quot; (Capitol 3678; 1973; No. 26), &quot;Molly (I Ain&#x27;t Getting&#x27; Any Younger)&quot; (Melodyland 6007: 1975; No. 28) and &quot;Things I Treasure&quot; (Calliope 8004; 1977; No. 31). He was voted Most Promising Male Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music in 1974, and in all, he had 15 country hits, but none made the top 20.

===Films===
During the 1970s, Dorsey turned to the big screen. In 1974, he was credited with writing the songs for the film &quot;Bootleggers&quot; (also known as &quot;Bootleggers Angel&quot;). In 1976, he helped compose the music, with Mike Curb and Duane Eddy, for &quot;Dixie Dynamite&quot;. In 1977, he was credited as the composer of the original music for the soundtrack of the horror movie &quot;Kingdom of the Spiders&quot;. In 1978, he was credited with singing the title song of the movie &quot;My Boys Are Good Boys&quot; as well as co-writing the song in collaboration with Doug Goodwin.

==Death==
In 1979, he signed with Elektra/Asylum label. Just after his first record release, however, he died of a massive heart attack at his home in Canoga Park, California, on August 19, 1979, aged 46. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Final public performance==
Dorsey last appeared in public on August 18, 1979 (the day before he died), at The Performing Arts Center in Oxnard, California. He played a half-hour show at a benefit for the Arthritis Foundation.

Patrick Landreville, who played the final show with Dorsey, stated:Most people that play benefits for national or international charities get paid for their performances, at the least their expenses are paid. But Dorsey and I choose to play for free at these affairs, though neither one of us is well off financially. Dorsey is a legendary figure in music and could command a hefty sum for his services but he&#x27;s chosen to give, not to take. I&#x27;m proud to know him and to have had the opportunity to make music with him and I&#x27;m especially proud that he considers me his peer.

==Legacy==
After his death, singer and friend Delaney Bramlett organized a benefit concert for Dorsey Burnette&#x27;s widow at The Forum in Inglewood, California, where Kris Kristofferson, Hoyt Axton, Tanya Tucker, Glen Campbell, Edward James Olmos, Duane Eddy, Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Gary Busey, Maureen McGovern and Roger Miller appeared. Burnette&#x27;s pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

<text>The great Highland bagpipe ( &#x27;the great pipe&#x27;) is a type of bagpipe native to Scotland, and the Scottish analogue to the great Irish warpipes. It has acquired widespread recognition through its usage in the British military and in pipe bands throughout the world.

The bagpipe of any kind is first attested in Scotland around 1400. The earliest references to bagpipes in Scotland are in a military context, and it is in that context that the great Highland bagpipe became established in the British military and achieved the widespread prominence it enjoys today, whereas other bagpipe traditions throughout Europe, ranging from Portugal to Russia, almost universally went into decline by the late 19th and early 20th century.

Though widely famous for its role in military and civilian pipe bands, the great Highland bagpipe is also used for a solo virtuosic style called &quot;pìobaireachd&quot;, &quot;ceòl mòr&quot;, or simply pibroch. Through development over the centuries, the great Highland bagpipes probably reached something like their distinctive modern form in the 18th century.

== History ==
Though popular belief sets varying dates for the introduction of bagpipes to Scotland, concrete evidence is limited until approximately the 15th century. One clan still owns a remnant of a set of bagpipes said to have been carried at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, though the veracity of this claim is debated. There are many ancient legends and stories about bagpipes which were passed down through minstrels and oral tradition, whose origins are now lost. However, textual evidence for Scottish bagpipes is more definite in 1396, when records of the Battle of the North Inch of Perth reference &quot;warpipes&quot; being carried into battle. These references may be considered evidence as to the existence of particularly Scottish bagpipes, but evidence of a form peculiar to the Highlands appears in a poem written in 1598 and later published in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; which refers to several types of pipe, including the Highland: &quot;On hieland pipes, Scotte and Hybernicke / Let heir be shraichs of deadlie clarions.&quot;

In 1746, after the forces loyal to the Hanoverian government had defeated the Jacobites in the Battle of Culloden, King George II attempted to assimilate the Highlands into Great Britain by weakening Gaelic culture and the Scottish clan system, though the oft-repeated claim that the Act of Proscription 1746 banned the Highland bagpipes is not substantiated by the text itself, nor by any record of any prosecutions under this act for playing or owning bagpipes. However, the loss of the clan chief&#x27;s power and patronage and widespread emigration did contribute to its decline. It was soon realised that Highlanders made excellent troops and a number of regiments were raised from the Highlands over the second half of the eighteenth century. Although the early history of pipers within these regiments is not well documented, there is evidence that these regiments had pipers at an early stage and there are numerous accounts of pipers playing into battle during the 19th century, a practice which continued into World War I when it was abandoned after the early battles, due to the high casualty rate.

The custom was revived by the 51st Highland Division for their assault on the enemy lines at the start of the Second Battle of El Alamein on 23 October 1943. Each attacking company was led by a piper, playing tunes that would allow other units to recognise which Highland regiment they belonged to. Although the attack was successful, losses among the pipers were high, and they were not used in combat again during the war. Bill Millin, the personal piper of Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, was at the landing of 1st Special Service Brigade at Sword Beach on 6 June 1944 in Normandy. At Lovat&#x27;s request he marched up and down the beach playing his pipes under fire. The Calgary Highlanders had company pipers play during the unit&#x27;s first battle in Normandy in July 1944, but likewise refrained from using pipers again for the rest of the war. A final use of the pipes in combat was in 1967 during the Aden Emergency, when 1st Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were led into the rebel-held Crater district by their pipe major playing the regimental marches.

== Design ==

The great Highland bagpipe is classified as a woodwind instrument, like the bassoon, oboe, and clarinet. Although it is further classified as a double-reed instrument, the reeds are all closed inside the wooden &quot;stocks&quot;, instead of being played directly by mouth as most other woodwinds are. The great Highland bagpipe actually has four reeds: the chanter reed (double), two tenor drone reeds (single), and one bass drone reed (single).

A modern set has a bag, a chanter, a blowpipe, two tenor drones, and one bass drone.

The scale of the chanter is in Mixolydian mode, which has a flattened seventh scale degree. It has a range from one whole tone lower than the tonic to one octave above it. The drones are tuned to this tonic note, called A (specifically A4). The nine notes of the chanter scale are &quot;low G, low A, B, C (sounds as a C), D, E, F (sounds as a F), high G, and high A&quot;. However, the A pitch of most pipers and pipe bands currently is somewhere around 470–480 Hz. Standard pitch B4 is 466.16 Hz. A minority of pipes, made or adapted for playing with other instruments, sound at exactly this pitch, with the scale sounding A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B. These are thus a transposing instrument in D-flat major (i.e. the pitch at which a notional C, were the bagpipe able to play it, would sound), but in bagpipe terminology are referred to as B instruments, with the pitch given for the tonic A rather than the C of conventional transposition terminology. As stated, most bagpipes currently sound sharper than this, but the great Highland bagpipe is often nonetheless described as a transposing instrument in D. Historically it was indeed flatter, as evidenced by recordings, and extant instruments.

Highland bagpipe music is written in the key of D major, where the C and F are sharp (despite the key-signature usually being omitted from scores), however only some tunes are in D major. Due to the lack of chromatic notes, to change key is also to change modes; tunes are in A Mixolydian (most commonly), D major, B minor, or occasionally E Dorian. In concert pitch (notes on the piano) it will be B Mixolydian, E major, C Aeolian, or occasionally F Dorian.

Traditionally, certain notes were sometimes tuned slightly off from just intonation. For example, on some old chanters the D and high G would be somewhat sharp. According to Forsyth (1935), the C and F holes were traditionally bored exactly midway between those for B and D and those for E and G, respectively, resulting in approximately a quarter-tone difference from just intonation, somewhat like a &quot;blue&quot; note in jazz. Today, however, the notes of the chanter are usually tuned in just intonation to the Mixolydian scale, with the G tuned to the harmonic seventh which is significantly flatter than the just minor seventh or the equal temperament minor seventh. The two tenor drones are an octave below the keynote of the chanter (low A), and the bass drone two octaves below. There are some documented examples of other tunings: Forsyth lists three traditional drone tunings: &quot;Ellis&quot;, A3–A3–A2; &quot;Glen&quot;, A4–A4–A2; and &quot;Mackay&quot;, G3–B3–C2.

Modern developments have included reliable synthetic drone reeds as well as synthetic bags that deal with moisture arguably better than hide bags.

The chanter reed is typically made out of cane. It is possible to get synthetic reeds for chanters but it is not very common. The cane reeds change pitch as the moisture levels change, meaning that as they are played they go out of tune. Until recently drone reeds were also cane but now many pipers have replaced cane reeds with synthetic reeds. Cane drone reeds are incredibly unreliable; they could stop working without warning and also change pitch as they are played. Synthetic reeds are much more reliable, they are easier to use and don&#x27;t change pitch meaning once the drones are tuned to each other they will stay there and only have to be tuned to the chanter.

== Materials ==

Highland pipes were originally constructed of such locally available woods as holly, laburnum, and boxwood. Later, as expanding colonisation and trade provided access to more exotic woods, tropical hardwoods including cocuswood (from the Caribbean), ebony (from West Africa and South and Southeast Asia) and African blackwood (from sub-Saharan Africa) became standard in the late 18th and early 19th century. In the modern day, synthetic materials, particularly Polypenco, have become quite popular, especially among pipe bands where uniformity of chanters is desirable.

Ornamentation on stands of pipes can be made from: ivory, horn, nickel, German silver, silver, stainless steel, imitation ivory (often catalin or possibly bakelite depending on the year the pipes were made), or other exotic woods.

== Music ==

Compared to many other musical instruments, the great Highland bagpipe is limited by its range (nine notes), lack of dynamics, and the enforced legato style, due to the continuous airflow from the bag. The great Highland bagpipe is a closed reed instrument, which means that the four reeds are completely encased within the instrument and the player cannot change the sound of the instrument via mouth position or tonguing. As a result, notes cannot be separated by simply stopping blowing or tonguing, so grace notes and combinations of grace notes, called &quot;embellishments&quot;, are used for this purpose. These are more complicated ornaments using two or more grace notes include doublings, taorluaths, throws, grips, and birls. There are also a set of ornaments usually used for &quot;pìobaireachd&quot;, for example the &quot;dare&quot;, &quot;vedare&quot;, &quot;chedare&quot;, &quot;darado&quot;, &quot;taorluath&quot; and &quot;crunluath&quot;. Some of these embellishments have found their way into light music over the course of the 20th century. These embellishments are also used for note emphasis, for example to emphasize the beat note or other phrasing patterns. These three single grace notes (G, D, and E) are the most commonly used and are often played in succession. All grace notes are performed rapidly, by quick finger movements, giving an effect similar to tonguing or articulation on modern wind instruments. Due to the lack of rests and dynamics, all expression in great Highland bagpipe music comes from the use of embellishments and to a larger degree by varying the duration of notes. Despite the fact that most great Highland bagpipe music is highly rhythmically regimented and structured, proper phrasing of all types of great Highland bagpipe music relies heavily on the ability of the player to stretch specific notes within a phrase or measure. In particular, the main beats and off-beats of each phrase are structured. However, sub-divisions within each beat are flexible.

Music for the great Highland bagpipe is divided into piobaireachd and light music.

The Scottish Gaelic word literally means &quot;piping&quot;, but it has been adapted into English as &quot;piobaireachd&quot; or &quot;pibroch&quot;. In Gaelic, this, the &quot;great music&quot; of the great Highland bagpipe is referred to as &quot;ceòl mòr&quot;. &quot;Ceòl mòr&quot; consists of a slow &quot;ground&quot; movement () which is a simple theme, then a series of increasingly complex variations on this theme, and ends with a return to the ground. The &quot;ceòl mòr&quot; style was developed by the well-patronized dynasties of bagpipers MacArthurs, MacGregors, Rankins, and especially the MacCrimmons and seems to have emerged as a distinct form during the 17th century.

&quot;Light music&quot; is also referred to as &quot;ceòl beag.&quot; &quot;Ceòl beag&quot; includes marches (, , , , etc.), dance tunes (particularly strathspeys, reels, hornpipes, and jigs), slow airs, and more. A common combination, particularly for competition purposes, is the march, strathspey, and reel (MSR).

Bagpipes are rarely played with other instruments due to their tuning. Most other instruments are tuned at standard concert pitch (440 Hz), whilst a bagpipe is tuned around 470–480 Hz. It is possible to change the pitch by using different chanters and reeds. &quot;Few attempts have been made hitherto to combine the bagpipes with classical orchestral instruments, due mainly to conflicts of balance and tuning,&quot; said composer Graham Waterhouse about his work &quot;Chieftain&#x27;s Salute&quot; Op. 34a for Great Highland Bagpipe and String Orchestra (2001). &quot;A satisfactory balance was achieved in this piece by placing the piper at a distance from the orchestra.&quot; Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27; &quot;Orkney Wedding, With Sunrise&quot; (1985) also features a great Highland Bagpipe solo towards the end.

== Cultural role ==
The great Highland bagpipe plays a role as both a solo and ensemble instrument. In ensembles, it is generally played as part of a pipe band. One notable form of solo employment is the position of Piper to the Sovereign, a position dating back to the time of Queen Victoria.

== Popular music ==
The great Highland bagpipes have played a minor, but not insignificant role in rock and pop music. Well-known examples of songs giving prominence to bagpipes include:

*&quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; by Wings featuring the Campbeltown Pipe Band
*&quot;Are you ready to rock?&quot; by Wizzard, played by Roy Wood
*&quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot; by AC/DC played by Bon Scott
*&quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot; by Korn, played by Jonathan Davis (plus numerous other songs throughout their discography)

== Worldwide diffusion ==
The great Highland bagpipe is widely used by both soloists and pipe bands, both civilian and military, and is now played in countries around the world. It is particularly popular in areas with large Scottish and Irish emigrant populations, mainly England, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

=== Former British Empire ===
The great Highland bagpipe has also been adopted by many countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, despite their lack of a Scottish or Irish population. These countries include India, Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia and Singapore.

The great Highland bagpipe also spread to parts of Africa and the Middle East where the British military&#x27;s use of pipes made a favourable impression. Piping spread to Arabic countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Oman, some of whom had previously existing bagpipe traditions. In Oman, the instrument is called &quot;habban&quot; and is used in cities such as Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar. In Uganda president Idi Amin forbade the export of African blackwood, to encourage local bagpipe construction, during the 1970s.

=== Thailand ===
The great Highland bagpipe was also adopted in Thailand; around 1921, King Rama VI ordered a set to accompany the marching exercises of the &quot;Sua Pa&quot; Wild Tiger Corps. This was a royal guard unit which had previously practiced to the sounds of an oboe called &quot;pi chawa&quot;.

Although the bagpipes arrived from the British Isles with a user&#x27;s manual, no one was able to figure out how to play them, so bassoon player Khun Saman Siang-prajak went to the British Embassy and learned how to play the instrument with the British soldiers, and then became instructor to the rest of the Corps. The band, which plays Thai as well as Scottish tunes, still practices at Vachiravuth High School in Bangkok, which is named for Rama VI.

=== Brittany ===

During the First World War, some Breton pipers serving in the French Army came in contact with the pipers of Scottish regiments, and brought back home a few great Highland bagpipes which Breton pipe-makers started copying. Polig Monjarret led the introduction of the Great Highland bagpipe to Brittany during the Celtic revival of the 1920s Breton folk music scene, inventing the &quot;bagad&quot;, a pipe band incorporating a &quot;binioù braz&quot; section, a bombarde section, a drums section, and in recent years almost any added grouping of wind instruments such as the saxophones, and brass instruments such as the trumpet and trombone.

Well known &quot;bagadoù&quot; include Bagad Kemper, Kevrenn Alre, Bagad Brieg and Bagad Cap Caval. In Brittany, the great Highland bagpipe is known as the &quot;binioù braz&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;binioù kozh&quot;, the small traditional Breton bagpipe.

One notable development of the Highland bagpipe in Brittany is the creation of slightly shorter drones in C (Scottish &quot;B&quot;; see notes on tuning above), so that the many tunes played in that key will have drone accompaniment in the tonic. Many &quot;bagad&quot; pipers will keep two sets of pipes, one in standard B (Scottish &quot;A&quot;) and one in C, and a whole suite may be performed in C.

== Notable bands ==

Some of the most famous pipe bands in the world are the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band, Shotts and Dykehead Caledonia Pipe Band, Simon Fraser University Pipe Band, The Inveraray &amp; District Pipe Band (the reigning world champions), The Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band, The St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole Pipe Band and Peoples Ford Boghall and Bathgate Caledonia Pipe Band, all of which have won the World Pipe Band Championships.

<text>Edward Irving Koch ( ; December 12, 1924February 1, 2013) was an American politician. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977 and was mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989.

Koch was a lifelong Democrat who described himself as a &quot;liberal with sanity&quot;. The author of an ambitious public housing renewal program in his later years as mayor, he began by cutting spending and taxes and cutting 7,000 employees from the city payroll. He was the second Jewish mayor of New York, after Abraham Beame. As a congressman before his terms as mayor of New York City, Koch was a fervent supporter of Israel. He crossed party lines to endorse Rudy Giuliani for mayor of New York City in 1993, Al D&#x27;Amato for Senate in 1998, Michael Bloomberg for mayor of New York City in 2001, and George W. Bush for president in 2004.

Koch was first elected mayor of New York City in 1977 and was re-elected in 1981 with 75% of the vote. He was the first New York City mayor to win endorsement on both the Democratic and Republican party tickets. In 1985, Koch was elected to a third term with 78% of the vote. His third term was fraught with scandal regarding political associates (although the scandal never touched him personally) and with racial tensions, including the killings of Michael Griffith and Yusuf Hawkins. In a close race, Koch lost the 1989 Democratic primary to his successor, David Dinkins.

== Early life ==
Koch was born in the Crotona Park East section of the Bronx in New York City, the son of Yetta (or Joyce, née Silpe) and Louis (Leib) Koch, Polish-Jewish immigrants from Kozliv and Uścieczko (Ustechko) in Eastern Galicia, both located in Ternopil Oblast in western Ukraine. He came from a family of Conservative Jews who resided in Newark, New Jersey, where his father worked at a theater. As a child, he worked as a hatcheck boy in a Newark dance hall. He graduated from South Side High School in Newark in 1941.

== WWII ==
In 1943, he was drafted into the United States Army. Koch did his basic training at Camp Croft, S.C., in 1943 before entering the Army Specialized Training Program. He then joined the 104th Infantry Division. On 27 August 1944, he departed New York City, landing in Cherbourg, France, on 7 September 1944. He earned a European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, a World War II Victory Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge for service in the European Theater of Operations. After V-E Day, because he could speak German, Koch was sent to Bavaria to help remove Nazi public officials from their jobs and find non-Nazis to take their place. He was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant in 1946.

== Post WWII ==

Koch returned to New York City to attend City College of New York, graduating in 1945, and New York University School of Law, receiving his law degree in 1948. Koch was a sole practitioner from 1949 to 1964, and a partner with Koch, Lankenau, Schwartz &amp; Kovner from 1965 to 1968. A Democrat, he became active in New York City politics as a reformer and opponent of Carmine DeSapio and Tammany Hall. In 1962 Koch ran for office for the first time, unsuccessfully opposing incumbent William Passannante, a DeSapio ally, for the Democratic nomination for the State Assembly.

In 1963, Koch defeated DeSapio for the position of Democratic Party leader for the district which included Greenwich Village, and Koch won again in a 1965 rematch. Koch served on the New York City Council from 1967 to 1969.

== Career ==

=== Elections ===
1968

Koch ran for Congress in New York&#x27;s 17th congressional district after Republican Theodore Roosevelt Kupferman retired. He defeated Republican Whitney Seymour Jr. and Conservative Richard J. Callahan, who partly split the conservative vote. He won 48.5% of the vote to Seymour&#x27;s 45.6% and Callahan&#x27;s 5.9%.

1970

Koch was reelected with 62% of the vote, defeating Republican Peter J. Sprague and Conservative Callahan who finished with 32% and 6%, respectively.

1972

In advance of the 1972 elections, Koch&#x27;s district was redistricted into the 18th district. He defeated Republican Jane Pickens Langley and Socialist Workers nominee Rebecca Finch, 70%–29%–1%.

1973

Koch briefly ran for mayor in 1973, but garnered little support and dropped out before the Democratic primary. He threw his support to State Assemblyman Albert H. Blumenthal, but Blumenthal&#x27;s bid was derailed by a scandal and he came in third. Comptroller Abraham Beame won the election.

1974

Koch won reelection (with career-best 76.7% of the vote) to the 18th district against John Boogaerts Jr. (Republican, 18.8%), Gilliam M. Drummond (Conservative, 3.7%), and Katherine Sojourner (Socialist Workers, 0.8%).

1976

Koch was again reelected, this time with 75.7% of the vote, defeating Sonia Landau (Republican, 20.1%), and James W. McConnell (Conservative, 4.3%).

1977

Koch announced his campaign for mayor of New York City against incumbent Beame. Koch and future governor Mario Cuomo finished first (19.8%) and second (18.7%) in the Democratic primary, eliminating Beame (18%). In a runoff, Koch defeated Cuomo, 55%-45%. In the general election, Koch again defeated Cuomo, who ran on the Liberal Party ticket, 50% to 41%.

Koch ran to the right of the other candidates on a &quot;law and order&quot; platform. According to historian Jonathan Mahler, the New York City blackout of July 1977 and the subsequent rioting helped catapult Koch and his message of restoring public safety to front-runner status.

1981

Koch won both the Democratic and Republican nominations and appeared on the ballot with both of their lines. He faced opposition only from third parties. He won 74.6% of the vote, with Unity candidate Frank Barbaro netting next-best 13.3%. John A. Esposito (Conservative) and Mary T. Codd (Liberal) also ran. Koch swept all five boroughs by landslide margins, breaking 60% of the vote in Manhattan and 70% in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.

1982

After incumbent Hugh Carey announced he would not run for reelection, Koch announced his candidacy for governor of New York. Cuomo, who had been elected lieutenant governor, also ran. Koch received the party&#x27;s endorsement with 61% of the convention vote, but Cuomo won the Democratic primary. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Cuomo&#x27;s victory a &quot;stunning upset&quot; that relied on &quot;an unusual coalition of liberal Democrats, labor, minorities and upstaters&quot;. Koch ran strongly in Jewish communities, while Cuomo won black, liberal, and Italian communities by a similar margin. A key to Cuomo&#x27;s victory was his strong showing in New York City itself; though Koch won the city and its four suburban counties (Rockland, Westchester, Suffolk, and Nassau) as expected, Cuomo kept the margin close and won half of the city&#x27;s Assembly districts. That, combined with large victories in nearly every upstate county, allowed Cuomo to win. Koch endorsed Cuomo immediately, declaring &quot;what&#x27;s important to all of us is that we keep a Democrat in Albany.&quot; Many say the deciding factor in Koch&#x27;s loss was an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in which he critiqued lifestyle of suburbia. Koch&#x27;s remarks are thought to have alienated many voters from outside New York City. Cuomo was elected governor over Republican Lewis Lehrman, and served three terms.

1985

Koch was reelected to a third term in a landslide. He defeated Carol Bellamy (Liberal) and Dian McGrath (Republican/Conservative), 78%-10%-9%, respectively, and was sworn into his third and final term in January 1986. As of 2021, this is the most recent mayoral election in which a Democrat carried Staten Island. During the campaign, Koch visited the Lubavitcher Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, seeking his blessing and endorsement.

1989

Koch ran for an unprecedented fourth term in 1989. No mayor had ever won a fourth term, though Fiorello La Guardia and Robert Wagner also served three terms, and Wagner attempted to run for a fourth in 1969. Koch lost the Democratic primary to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, who finished with 547,901 votes to Koch&#x27;s 456,313. Dinkins was helped in part by large margins in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, while Koch carried Staten Island and Queens. Dinkins defeated Rudy Giuliani in the general election by a narrow margin, with Giuliani carrying both counties Koch won in the primary. Giuliani won a rematch against Dinkins in 1993.

=== U.S. Congressional tenure ===
Koch was the Democratic U.S. Representative from New York&#x27;s 17th congressional district from January 3, 1969, until January 3, 1973, when, after a redistricting, he represented New York&#x27;s 18th congressional district until December 31, 1977, when he resigned to become Mayor of New York City.

Koch said he began his political career as &quot;just a plain liberal&quot;, with positions including opposing the Vietnam War and marching in the South for civil rights. In April 1973, Koch coined the term &quot;Watergate Seven&quot; when, in response to U.S. Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr.&#x27;s indicating that one of the men in Watergate scandal had been ordered in the spring of 1972 to keep certain senators and representatives under surveillance, he posted a sign on his office door reading, &quot;These premises were surveilled by the Watergate Seven. Watch yourself&quot;. At about the same time, Koch began his rightward shift toward being a &quot;liberal with sanity&quot; after reviewing the 1973 controversy around then-New York City Mayor John Lindsay&#x27;s attempt to place a 3,000-person housing project in a middle-class community in Forest Hills, Queens. Koch met with residents of the community, most of whom were against the proposal. He was convinced by their arguments, and spoke out against the plan, shocking some of his liberal allies.

Koch was active in advocating for a greater U.S. role in advancing human rights within the context of fighting Communism. He had particular influence in the foreign aid budget, as he sat on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. In 1976, Koch proposed that the U.S. cut off military aid and supplies to the military dictatorship of Uruguay. In mid-July 1976, the CIA learned that two high-level Uruguayan intelligence officers had discussed a possible assassination attempt on Koch by Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA), the Chilean secret police under dictator Augusto Pinochet. The CIA did not regard these threats as credible until after the September 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., by DINA agents coordinated by Operation Condor. After that, Director of Central Intelligence George H. W. Bush informed Koch of the threat. Koch subsequently asked both the CIA and the FBI for protection, but none was extended.

=== Tenure as mayor of New York City ===
==== First term ====
When Koch entered office the city was facing multiple serious issues. The city was in financial crisis, crime rates were soaring, and the city was still recovering from a major blackout and looting. Koch instituted austerity measures which put the city on better financial foundations for his second term.

During his first term as mayor, which many consider his best, a number of major events occurred in New York City. John Lennon&#x27;s abrupt assassination sent shock waves around the world. Grief-stricken New Yorkers walked the streets openly crying for days after the shooting, which took place in front of The Dakota, Lennon&#x27;s place of residence on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. Koch also dealt with the second transit strike, and pushed for the 1980 Democratic National Convention to be in NYC. His first term also saw a sister city relationship begin with Beijing.

==== Second term ====

Among the events of Koch&#x27;s second term as mayor were the Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s 100th anniversary, the appointing of Benjamin Ward as the city&#x27;s first ever African American police commissioner in 1983, the emergence of AIDS as a public health crisis, extensive media coverage of Bernhard Goetz&#x27;s shooting of four African American teenagers in the subway in 1984, and the United Nations&#x27; 40th anniversary.

Koch often deviated from the conventional liberal line, strongly supporting the death penalty, adding 3,500 officers to the NYPD in the 1980s, and taking a hard line on &quot;quality of life&quot; issues, such as giving police broader powers in dealing with the homeless and signing legislation banning the playing of radios on subways and buses. These positions prompted harsh criticism from the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and many African-American leaders, particularly Reverend Al Sharpton.

In 1984, Koch published his first memoir, &quot;Mayor&quot;, which became a best-seller and was adapted into an off-Broadway and later Broadway musical, &quot;Mayor&quot;.

==== Third term ====
In 1986, Koch signed a lesbian and gay rights ordinance for the city after the City Council passed the measure (on March 20), after 15 years of failed attempts by that body to approve such legislation. Despite his overall pro-lesbian and pro-gay-rights stance, he nonetheless backed up the New York City Health Department&#x27;s decision to shut down the city&#x27;s gay bathhouses in 1985 in response to concerns over the spread of AIDS. The enactment of the measure the next year placed the city in a dilemma, as it apparently meant that the bathhouses would have to be reopened because many heterosexual &quot;sex clubs&quot;such as Plato&#x27;s Retreatwere in operation in the city at the time, and allowing them to remain open while keeping the bathhouses shuttered would have been a violation of the newly adopted anti-discrimination law. The Health Department, with Koch&#x27;s approval, reacted by ordering the heterosexual clubs, including Plato&#x27;s Retreat, to close as well. Also in 1986, Koch participated in Hands Across America and in the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration. Koch&#x27;s third term was also marked by the career-ending face-slashing of model Marla Hanson, the paralyzing shooting of NYCPD detective Steven McDonald, the crack cocaine epidemic and its related gangs, the Robert Chambers &quot;preppie murder&quot; case, the Howard Beach incident, and the racially motivated murder of Yusef Hawkins.

Koch consistently demonstrated a fierce love for New York City, which some observers felt he carried to extremes on occasion: in 1984, he went on record as opposing the creation of a second telephone area code for the city, claiming that this would divide the city&#x27;s population; and when the National Football League&#x27;s New York Giants won Super Bowl XXI in January 1987, he refused to grant a permit for the team to hold their traditional victory parade in the city, quipping famously, &quot;If they want a parade, let them parade in front of the oil drums in Moonachie&quot; (a town in New Jersey adjacent to the East Rutherford site of the Meadowlands Sports Complex, where the Giants play their home games).

In his third term, Koch&#x27;s popularity was shaken after a series of corruption scandals, touched off by Donald Manes&#x27;s suicide and the Parking Violations Bureau scandal, which revealed that he had acceded to the requests of political allies (most notably Queens Borough President Manes, Bronx Democratic Party official Stanley M. Friedman and Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman Meade Esposito, an American Mafia associate long perceived as New York City&#x27;s preeminent political leader) to stack city agencies with patronage appointments. There were no allegations that Koch obtained any financial benefit from the corruption, but the scandals undermined Koch&#x27;s claims that he ran a patronage-free municipal government. Michael Tager attributes the scandals not to Koch&#x27;s failures but to the steadily declining power of the Democratic machine and its bosses&#x27; desperate efforts to reverse the collapse.

In July 1987, Koch proposed banning bicycling on Fifth, Park and Madison Avenues during weekdays, but many bicyclists protested and had the ban overturned.
It has been said that race relations in Koch&#x27;s last years in office were poor. He became a controversial figure in the 1988 presidential campaign with his public criticism of Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson, who surprised many political observers by winning key primaries in March and running even with the front-runner, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. As the April New York primary approached, Koch reminded voters of Jackson&#x27;s earlier antisemitic statements, and said that Jews would be &quot;crazy&quot; to vote for Jackson. Koch endorsed Tennessee Senator Al Gore, who had run well in his native South but hadn&#x27;t won 20% in a northern state. As Koch&#x27;s anti-Jackson rhetoric intensified, Gore seemed to shy away from Koch. On primary day, Gore finished a weak third place with 10% of the vote and dropped out of the race. Jackson ran ten points behind Dukakis, whose nomination became assured after his New York win.

====Assessments====
A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Koch as the 15th-worst American big-city mayor to have served between 1820 and 1993. Other analyses rate his tenure more favorably.

In the final chapter of &quot;Ed Koch and the Rebuilding of New York City&quot; (Columbia University Press, 2010), NYU history professor Jonathan Soffer wrote: &quot;Koch faced challenges greater than any New York mayor of the 20th century and met many of them.&quot; He added, &quot;Koch bravely faced one of the worst crises in New York history, restructured the city with minimal help from the federal government and kept it solvent and growing for a generation.&quot; And Soffer concluded, &quot;Koch&#x27;s tireless personal lobbying campaign led to quite simply the greatest turnaround accomplished by any New York mayor in the twentieth century, including Fiorello La Guardia.&quot;

Sam Roberts, former City Editor for the New York Daily News and Urban Affairs Correspondent for the New York Times, in The New York Times Book Review of Soffer&#x27;s book reconciled Holli&#x27;s negative survey of 1993 with Soffer&#x27;s analysis of 2010, writing, &quot;Perhaps the survey was taken too soon, before Mr. Koch&#x27;s legacy could be fully appreciated.&quot;

=== Post-mayoral years ===
In the years following his mayoralty, Koch became a partner in the law firm of Robinson, Silverman, Pearce, Aronsohn, and Berman LLP (now Bryan Cave LLP) and a commentator on politics, as well as reviewing movies and restaurants for newspapers, radio and television. He also became an adjunct professor at New York University (NYU) and the judge on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; for two years (1997–99) following the retirement of Judge Joseph Wapner. In 1999, he was a visiting professor at Brandeis University. Koch regularly appeared on the lecture circuit, and had a high-rated talk show on WABC radio. He also hosted his own online movie review show, &quot;The Mayor at the Movies&quot;.

A street in southern Tel Aviv was named after Koch in an August 12, 1993, ceremony attended by him alongside prominent Israeli and American dignitaries.

In 2004, together with his sister Pat (also Pauline) Koch Thaler, Koch wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Eddie, Harold&#x27;s Little Brother&quot;; it tells the story of Koch&#x27;s childhood, when he tried unsuccessfully to emulate his older brother Harold&#x27;s baseball talents, before realizing that he should instead focus on what he was already good at, which was telling stories and speaking in public.

The New York City Council voted to rename the Queensboro Bridge the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge on March 23, 2011. Later, city councilman Peter Vallone introduced legislation banning the naming of New York City property after people who are still alive, but the legislation failed.

Koch formed an organization called New York Uprising to push for statewide redistricting reform. In April 2011, he publicly upbraided 42 state legislators he claimed had broken their promises to support redistricting reform.

In May 2011, Koch sat for a portrait by Dmitry Borshch that has been exhibited at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, DePaul University, Brecht Forum, and CUNY Graduate Center, and is included in the Catalog of American Portraits at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery.

==== &quot;Mayor at the Movies&quot; ====
Koch began appearing in weekly movie review segments for an online show, &quot;Mayor at the Movies&quot;, in the summer of 2009. He was an avid moviegoer who often saw two or three movies a weekend. Although he was invited to private screenings, Koch preferred to see films with a public audience and was often approached by moviegoers who were surprised to find him there. His reviews were outspoken and wry, with his rating system consisting not of stars but of a &quot;plus&quot; for a good film or a &quot;minus&quot; for a bad one. He sought out great documentaries, and had a particular passion for anything of Jewish interest.

He had a particular passion for independent cinema and documentaries, but enjoyed dramas and action films as well. In addition to &quot;Mayor at the Movies&quot;, his film reviews were regularly featured on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and in the New York newspaper &quot;The Villager&quot;. Koch also appeared in more than 60 Hollywood films and television shows as himself, including &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Double Rush&quot;, a brief cameo in &quot;The Muppets Take Manhattan&quot; and also hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. A documentary about his life, &quot;Koch&quot;, had its world premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 8, 2012, and was released theatrically on February 1, 2013 (coincidentally, the day of Koch&#x27;s death).

=== Political endorsements ===
After leaving office, Koch frequently endorsed prominent Republican candidates, including Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg for mayor, Al D&#x27;Amato for U.S. Senate, Peter T. King for U.S. House, George Pataki for governor, and, in 2004, George W. Bush for president. Koch also endorsed Democrats, including Eliot Spitzer for governor in the 2006 election. He endorsed Bill Bradley for president in 2000.

Koch took back his endorsement of Spitzer in the aftermath of the governor&#x27;s prostitution scandal. He said, &quot;At the time the prostitution episode emerged, I commented that nothing could explain his behavior other than the fact that he had a screw loose in his head. Probably several.&quot;

Though Koch supported Giuliani&#x27;s first mayoral bid, he became opposed to him in January 1996, and began writing a series of columns in the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; criticizing Giuliani, most frequently accusing him of being authoritarian and insensitive. In 1999, the columns were compiled into the book &quot;Giuliani: Nasty Man&quot;. He resumed his attacks, and had the book republished, in 2007, after Giuliani announced his candidacy for president. In May 2007, Koch called Giuliani &quot;a control freak&quot; and said that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t meet with people he didn&#x27;t agree with. That&#x27;s pretty crazy.&quot; He also said that Giuliani &quot;was imbued with the thought that if he was right, it was like a God-given right. That&#x27;s not what we need in a president.&quot;

Koch originally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president during the 2008 campaign, then endorsed Democratic nominee Barack Obama in the general election. In his endorsement of Obama, Koch wrote that he felt that (unlike in 2004) both candidates would do their best to protect both the United States and Israel from terrorist attacks, but that he agreed with Obama&#x27;s domestic policies much more and that the idea of Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin ascending to the presidency &quot;would scare me&quot;. In 2010, he rescinded his support for Obama, saying that Obama could very well harm American–Israeli relations.

Koch endorsed Republican Bob Turner for Congress in 2011 because he &quot;wanted to send a message to Obama to take a stronger position in support of Israel.&quot;

In October 2012, Koch told Al Sharpton that after a conversation with Obama about his position on Israel he was satisfied, and endorsed his reelection.

Early in 2013, Koch endorsed Christine Quinn in the Democratic primary for that year&#x27;s mayoral election.

=== Other political statements ===
Koch often wrote in defense of Israel and against antisemitism. He also appeared in the documentary &quot;FahrenHYPE 9/11&quot; defending President Bush and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and blasting Michael Moore. Koch was quoted in the film saying of Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s not a documentary, it&#x27;s a lie.&quot;

Koch praised New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, saying that he had the right approach in reducing government spending and refraining from raising taxes.

Koch was an early supporter of the Iraq War. In July 2007, Koch wrote that he was &quot;bailing out&quot; of his previous support for that war, due to the failure of the United States&#x27; NATO allies, and other Arab countries, to contribute to the war effort. Koch wrote, &quot;I would support our troops remaining in Iraq if our allies were to join us. But they have made it clear they will not.&quot; He added that the U.S. must still &quot;prepare for the battles that will take place on American soil by the Islamic forces of terror who are engaged in a war that will be waged by them against Western civilization for at least the next 30 years.&quot;

On April 8, 2010, Koch wrote a piece in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; excoriating what he saw as increasing anti-Catholicism in the media, largely made evident by coverage of the priest sex abuse scandals. While denouncing the abuse, Koch wrote, &quot;the procession of articles on the same events are, in my opinion, no longer intended to inform, but simply to castigate.&quot; He also wrote that he believed that many in the media, some themselves Catholic, exhibited such anti-Catholicism largely because of their opposition to the Catholic Church&#x27;s teachings on such issues as abortion, homosexuality, and artificial contraception. He stated that, while he opposed the Church&#x27;s teaching in all these matters, he firmly believed that the Church had the right to espouse these beliefs and to expect its members to espouse them as well, calling the Church &quot;a force for good in the world, not evil.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Koch was a resident of Greenwich Village for most of his adult life. At the time of his death, he lived at 2 Fifth Avenue, overlooking Washington Square Park.

===Sexuality===
Koch never married, and rumors about his sexual orientation became an issue in the 1977 mayoral election with the appearance of placards and posters (disavowed by the Cuomo campaign) with the slogan &quot;Vote for Cuomo, Not the Homo.&quot; Koch denounced the attack.

In 1989, Koch was interviewed about a book he had coauthored with Cardinal John J. O&#x27;Connor. When the interviewer asked Koch to clarify his views on homosexuality relative to O&#x27;Connor, Koch responded, &quot;I happen to believe that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with homosexuality. It&#x27;s whatever God made you. It happens that I&#x27;m a heterosexual.&quot; He once told &quot;New York&quot; magazine, &quot;Listen, there&#x27;s no question that some New Yorkers think I&#x27;m gay, and voted for me nevertheless. The vast majority don&#x27;t care, and others don&#x27;t think I am. And I don&#x27;t give a shit either way!&quot; He was frequently accompanied at political functions by his friend Bess Myerson, who also acted as co-chair of his 1977 election campaign.

In a 2022 article, &quot;The New York Times&quot; confirmed Koch&#x27;s homosexuality, based on interviews with close confidants. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Koch disclosed his sexuality only to friends who were also gay, and was only known to have had one long-term relationship, with health care consultant Richard W. Nathan. Koch quickly ended the relationship after being elected mayor. In the 1980s, activist and writer Larry Kramer, who was critical of Koch&#x27;s handling of the AIDS epidemic, unsuccessfully attempted to out him after learning of the relationship with Nathan. This influenced Koch&#x27;s insistence on remaining closeted for the rest of his life, as he did not &quot;want to give activists like Mr. Kramer the satisfaction of seeing him come out, after they had tried so hard to see him outed&quot;.

=== Health, death and funeral ===
Koch had a mild stroke in 1987, but was able to resume his duties as mayor within about a week. A former spokesman later suggested that the anxiety Koch experienced from efforts to out him during that period caused a decline in his health, which could have contributed to the stroke.

After his mayoralty, Koch experienced further health problems, particularly heart issues, and was frequently hospitalized in the final months of his life. On January 31, 2013, he was admitted to Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan due to fatigue, where he died from heart failure at 2 a.m. the next day, aged 88. His funeral took place on February 4, 2013, at Temple Emanu-El, a Reform Jewish congregation in Manhattan. Former president Bill Clinton addressed the congregation, serving as President Obama&#x27;s representative. Other speakers included then-mayor Michael Bloomberg. New York City Police Department helicopters gave a fly-over at the service.

Koch purchased a burial plot in Trinity Church Cemetery in April 2008 so that he could be buried in Manhattan. It is the only graveyard in the borough that accepts new burials. He chose to put the last words of the late journalist Daniel Pearl on his tombstone: &quot;My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.&quot;

== Wit ==
A practiced public speaker since his days stumping for Adlai Stevenson, Koch was well known for his quips and one-liners. A few include:
* (On the occasion of his primary loss to David Dinkins) &quot;The people have spoken ... and they must be punished.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m the sort of person who will never get ulcers. Why? Because I say exactly what I think. I&#x27;m the sort of person who might give other people ulcers.&quot;
* &quot;If you agree with me on nine out of 12 issues, vote for me. If you agree with me on 12 out of 12 issues, see a psychiatrist.&quot;

<doc id="246298" wikidata="Q350538" url="?curid=246298" title="Adam Oates">
<text>Adam Robert Oates (born August 27, 1962) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, former co-head coach for the New Jersey Devils and former head coach for the Washington Capitals. He played 19 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, Boston Bruins, Washington Capitals, Philadelphia Flyers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Edmonton Oilers from 1985 to 2004. Known as an elite playmaker, Oates&#x27; career total of 1,079 assists was the fifth-highest total in NHL history at the time of his 2004 retirement. He has the highest number of games played and points scored among undrafted NHL players, with 1,337 and 1,420, respectively.

After retiring as a player, Oates served as an assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Lightning and New Jersey Devils before joining the Capitals as their head coach for two seasons, from 2012 to 2014. In 2017, Oates was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.

As a college player, Oates was a standout forward for the RPI Engineers. He set single-season school records for assists and points. He was named an Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) all-star and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American in both 1984 and 1985. Oates was named a tournament all-star in helping RPI win the 1985 national championship, and in 1990–91, the NHL included him in its second All-Star team; he played in five All-Star Games. He holds the record for most points all-time of any NHL player who also played NCAA Hockey. Oates was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2012.

==Early life==
Oates was born on August 27, 1962, in Weston, a neighborhood in Toronto. As a youth, he played both hockey and box lacrosse, favouring the latter sport. He played in the 1975 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Toronto.

Oates played five seasons with the Etobicoke Eclipse of the Ontario Lacrosse Association (OLA) Junior A Lacrosse League. An offensive standout, Oates&#x27; total of 181 points in 19 games in 1981 was the 11th highest total in OLA junior history at the time. As the league&#x27;s leading scorer, he won the Bobby Allan Award and in one game that season, set OLA Junior A single-game records of 19 assists and 29 points. Oates played one season of Senior A with the Brampton Excelsiors of Major Series Lacrosse but left the game in 1984 to focus on his hockey career.

Describing his younger self as a &quot;punk&quot;, Oates said he partied frequently. He dropped out of high school to focus on hockey and ended up working as a gas station attendant at age 19. Oates played two full seasons and parts of a third with the Junior A Markham Waxers of the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League (OPJAHL). He scored 89 points in 43 games during 1980–81 and 159 points – including 105 assists – in 1981–82. He went unselected in the NHL Entry Draft; however, as scouts considered him too slow to play in the NHL. He returned to high school to complete his diploma when he was recruited to play for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

==Playing career==

===College===
RPI&#x27;s assistant coach Paul Allen noticed Oates during a 1982 OPJAHL game while scouting a different player and offered him a position on the school&#x27;s team. Consequently, Oates played three seasons with the RPI Engineers, leading the team in assists each year. After scoring 42 points in 22 games in his freshman season of 1982–83, he spent the summer working with a skating instructor to improve his foot speed. In 1983–84, he set school records in points with 83 and assists with 57. He was named to the East Coast Athletic Conference (ECAC) second all-star team. He became the first RPI hockey player to earn a berth on the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All-American team since 1965.

In 1984–85, Oates broke his own school records by recording 60 assists and 91 points. His career total of 150 assists remains a school record . Again named an NCAA All-American, he was voted to the ECAC first all-star team and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award as the top hockey player in the NCAA. After helping RPI win the 1985 national championship, he was included in the all-tournament team. In his three years with RPI, the Engineers recorded an record and won the ECAC championships in 1984 and 1985. Oates was voted to the ECAC&#x27;s all-decade team of the 1980s. He was inducted into RPI&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame and was named the inaugural member of the hockey team&#x27;s Ring of Honor in 2004.

===Detroit and St. Louis===
NHL teams took an interest in Oates following his junior season; at least five teams attempted to sign him. Choosing to forgo his final year of college eligibility, Oates signed a four-year, $1.1 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings that made him the highest paid rookie in the NHL in 1985–86. He made his NHL debut on October 10, 1985, against the Minnesota North Stars, scoring his first goal that night on goaltender Don Beaupre and added an assist. After this, Oates struggled offensively and was pointless in his following 16 games; the team subsequently demoted him to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL). Oates split the remainder of the season between Detroit and Adirondack, finishing his first NHL season with 38 games played, 9 goals and 11 assists. He scored 18 goals and 28 assists in 34 games in the AHL. Having finished the NHL season in Detroit, he was returned to Adirondack for the AHL playoffs, which the team won to take the Calder Cup championship.

Oates became a fulltime NHLer in 1986–87, scoring 47 points in 76 games. He improved to 54 points in 63 games the following year despite missing a month due to a groin injury, and finished third in team scoring with 78 points in 1988–89. However, Detroit made changes following a first round loss in the playoffs; Oates, along with Paul MacLean, was traded to the St. Louis Blues on June 15, 1989, in exchange for veterans Bernie Federko and Tony McKegney. The deal, which is now considered one of the worst in Red Wings&#x27; history, left Oates &quot;heartbroken&quot; to leave his first NHL club.
The Blues made Oates their first-line centre and played him alongside Brett Hull. The pair, dubbed &quot;Hull and Oates&quot; as a play on the band Hall and Oates, put up prolific offensive numbers. In 1989–90, Oates topped the 100-point mark for the first time in his career with 102 points. He improved to 115 in 1990–91. He helped Hull score 72 and 86 goals those seasons, the latter the third highest in single-season total in NHL history. Oates was named to the second all-star team following the season and played in the 1991 All-Star Game.

Oates signed a four-year, $3 million contract extension with the Blues prior to the 1991–92 season, but after the team signed Brendan Shanahan, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter to significant deals, felt he was underpaid. After playing in his second career All-Star Game, he threatened to walk off the team following the All-Star break if the Blues did not renegotiate his contract, prompting a negative reaction from St. Louis fans, who booed him loudly. The conflict was resolved on February 7, 1992, when the team traded him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Craig Janney and Stéphane Quintal.

===Boston and Washington===
Oates&#x27; best individual season came in his first full year in Boston. He led the league with 97 assists in 1992–93 and finished third in overall scoring with 142 points. At the 1993 All-Star Game, Oates set a record by recording four assists in one period as part of a 16–6 victory for the Wales Conference. He played in his fourth consecutive All-Star Game in 1994 and again finished third in league scoring with 112 points in 1993–94. In a five-year period between 1989 and 1994, Oates was the second-highest point producer in the NHL. His average of 114 points per season over that time was second to Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 124.

A finger injury suffered during the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs hampered Oates throughout the 1994–95 season and required surgery at the season&#x27;s conclusion. Despite the injury, Oates finished fourth in the NHL with 41 assists in a season disrupted by a work stoppage. In game five of the conference quarter-final series against the New Jersey Devils, Oates scored the final goal in the history of the Boston Garden in a 3–2 loss. The Bruins signed him to a five-year, $10 million contract extension late in that season, but Oates once again became frustrated with his salary relative to the rest of the league by 1997. With the Bruins struggling on the ice and out of playoff contention late in 1996–97 season, Oates publicly berated team management, saying, &quot;You go on a [road] trip and everyone says it&#x27;s a big trip. For what? So we can win five games because we&#x27;re lousy and we get in the eighth spot and lose four straight and get embarrassed and then get shelled all summer? It&#x27;s upstairs, baby. That&#x27;s their job, not ours. ... Are we rebuilding? What are we doing? What direction are we going in?&quot;

Less than two weeks after his tirade, on March 1, 1997, Oates was traded to the Washington Capitals. In the trade, Oates, Bill Ranford and Rick Tocchet went to Washington in exchange for Jim Carey, Anson Carter, Jason Allison and two draft picks, 3rd Round 1997 (Lee Goren) &amp; Conditional 2nd Round 1998 (Bobby Allen) Oates initially refused to report to Washington, demanding his contract be renegotiated, but chose to join the team after a four-day holdout. He continued to demand a new contract in the off-season, while his agent claimed Oates would retire before playing for the Capitals again. After several months of contentious negotiations, the two sides agreed to a three-year contract worth around $2.9 million per season with an option on a fourth year.

Oates became the 47th player in NHL history, and the 15th fastest, to score his 1,000th career point on October 7, 1997, against the New York Islanders. He reached the milestone by scoring a hat-trick and adding two assists for the sixth five-point game of his career. He finished the 1997–98 season as the team leader with 56 assists, and second to Peter Bondra in team scoring with 78 points. The Capitals reached the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep; their first finals appearance in franchise history.

The Capitals named Oates the ninth captain in franchise history prior to the 1999–2000 season, following the departure of his predecessor, Dale Hunter. He led the team in scoring with 71 points and played his 1,000th NHL game on December 22, 1999, against the Vancouver Canucks. He led the league in assists the following two seasons, at the ages of 38 and 39, with 69 in 2000–01 and 64 in 2001–02. On January 14, 2002, Oates became the eighth player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career assists when he set up Dainus Zubrus&#x27; overtime winning goal in a 1–0 victory over the Boston Bruins.

===Philadelphia, Anaheim and Edmonton===
With Washington out of playoff contention late in the 2001–02 season and with his contract expiring following the season, the Capitals traded Oates to the Philadelphia Flyers on March 19, 2002, in exchange for goaltender Maxime Ouellet and the Flyers&#x27; first, second and third round selections in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft. The Flyers hoped that bringing Oates in would solidify their playoff chances. The move did not work, as the Flyers were defeated in the first round by the lower ranked Ottawa Senators, losing the series in five games. The team scored only one goal in regulation time and were shut-out three times by Ottawa&#x27;s Patrick Lalime.

The Flyers chose not to offer Oates a new contract following the loss, making him an unrestricted free agent. He then signed a $3.5 million contract for the 2002–03 season, with an option for 2003–04, with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on July 1, 2002. He scored 45 points in 67 games with the Mighty Ducks, and added 13 points in 21 playoff games. Anaheim reached the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, where in the third game of the series against the New Jersey Devils, Oates assisted on Ruslan Salei&#x27;s overtime-winning goal. It was Oates&#x27; ninth career playoff overtime point, tying him with Joe Sakic and Doug Gilmour for the NHL all-time lead. The Ducks ultimately lost the series in seven games.

The Mighty Ducks declined their option on the 41-year-old Oates&#x27; contract, again making him a free agent. He remained unsigned six weeks into the 2003–04 season until he agreed to a one-year contract with the Edmonton Oilers on November 17, 2003. He appeared in 60 games in Edmonton, scoring 2 goals and 16 assists. The Oilers were eliminated from playoff contention in their final game of the season with a 5–2 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on April 4, 2004. Oates announced his retirement as a player immediately after the game.

==Playing style==

Oates was one of the NHL&#x27;s great playmakers, a style that he credits his father as encouraging: &quot;It was just kind of our family talks: &#x27;If you can be unselfish, your teammates will always like you.&#x27; And it just kind of became my role, where I was obviously trying to please my dad, growing up and becoming a playmaker out of that.&quot; Oates&#x27; father, a British immigrant, idolized Stanley Matthews, considered one of the greatest association football (soccer) players of all-time and hoped that his son would adopt a pass-first mentality similar to Matthews.

Oates led the NHL in assists three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and finished in the top ten on 12 occasions. Oates finished third in league scoring three times; 1990–91, 1992–93, and 1993–94. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely, and Peter Bondra reach the mark. His teammates praised his consistency, noting Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. Oates scored himself, reaching the 20-goal mark seven times, including a career-high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals. Boston teammate Ray Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated, saying, &quot;I think a lot of people take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He&#x27;s not a flashy guy. He&#x27;s not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He&#x27;s the best centerman I&#x27;ve been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn&#x27;t see him this much.&quot; Others noted that Oates never received the attention nor honors of the other nine players on the NHL&#x27;s top ten all-time assists list.

At the time of Oates&#x27; retirement, his 1,420 points were the 13th highest total in NHL history, and his 1,079 assists ranked 5th. He played in a total of five NHL All-Star Games and was a six-time finalist for the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct on the ice (Oates has described himself as the Susan Lucci for the Lady Byng.) The Markham Waxers retired his jersey number 10 in 1999. Oates was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as part of its 2012 class.

==Coaching career==

===Assistant coach===
The Tampa Bay Lightning hired Oates as an assistant coach in the 2009–10 season, where he worked with the team&#x27;s offence. Under his guidance, the team&#x27;s power play finished ninth in the league and he was credited with playing a significant role in Steven Stamkos&#x27; offensive development. Oates then joined the New Jersey Devils in 2010, where he served an additional two years as an assistant coach, helping the team reach the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games. New Jersey general manager Lou Lamoriello praised Oates&#x27; work with the team: &quot;He did an outstanding job for us. I wish him well. He&#x27;s very communicative, very intelligent, he explains things very well. He has the resume behind him as a player and having the success he had – all the credentials are there for having the kind of respect players have for him.&quot;

===Washington Capitals===
The same day Oates was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame, June 26, 2012, he returned to Washington Capitals, where he was named the 16th head coach in franchise history, succeeding Dale Hunter, who had decided not to renew his contract. Oates&#x27; former teammates praised his appointment as head coach, calling him a &quot;detail-oriented players&#x27; coach&quot; with excellent communication skills. While the 2012–13 NHL lockout delayed Oates&#x27; debut with the Capitals, he acted as co-coach with Mark French for Washington&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears.

When the NHL resumed for the shortened 2012–13 season, Oates and the Capitals struggled initially and won only 2 of their first 11 games. However, the team improved throughout the season and went from last place in the Southeast Division to first; they won 15 of their final 19 games to win the division title. Oates&#x27; players praised his positive outlook and willingness to work closely with them as primary reasons why the team was able to turn its season around. However, the Capitals were defeated in the first round of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, losing to the New York Rangers in seven games.

The Capitals struggled throughout the 2013–14 season and faced increasing discontent from the fans as the team had failed to advance far into the playoffs in 16 years. The team finished with a 38–30–14 record, but finished ninth in the Eastern Conference and missed the playoffs. As a consequence, the Capitals opted to dismiss both Oates as head coach and the team&#x27;s general manager, George McPhee.

===New Jersey Devils===
On December 27, 2014, Oates was hired by the New Jersey Devils to become what the team referred to as a &quot;co-head coach&quot; following the team&#x27;s firing of head coach Peter DeBoer. Oates split coaching duties with former Devils captain Scott Stevens, with each coach responsible for a specific group of players; Oates was responsible for the forwards while Stevens was responsible for the defensemen. Oates and Stevens were assisted by Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello, who had previously served as the team&#x27;s interim head coach. On June 1, 2015, John Hynes was named the new full-time head coach.

==Personal life==
Although Oates left RPI after three years to begin his professional hockey career, he continued his studies during the off-seasons. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Management from the school in 1991.

While a member of the Bruins, Oates also worked for a brief time with the investment firm Boston Capital Partners.

Oates is a co-founder of sporting apparel retailer Old Time Hockey, which donates a portion of all sales to the NHL emergency assistance fund.

Oates operated a men&#x27;s boutique on 69th and 3rd in New York City for a few years, which he discussed when profiled by Harry Rosen.

His parents are David and Loretta, and he has two sisters: Michelle and Laurel. Oates was once engaged to model and actress Darlene Vogel; however, the couple cancelled their planned 1998 marriage at the last moment. He also has a house in Osterville, Massachusetts.

<doc id="246299" wikidata="Q60347" url="?curid=246299" title="Walter H. Schottky">
<text>Walter Hans Schottky (; 23 July 1886 – 4 March 1976) was a German physicist who played a major early role in developing the theory of electron and ion emission phenomena, invented the screen-grid vacuum tube in 1915 while working at Siemens, co-invented the ribbon microphone and ribbon loudspeaker along with Dr. Erwin Gerlach in 1924 and later made many significant contributions in the areas of semiconductor devices, technical physics and technology.

The Schottky effect (a thermionic emission, important for vacuum tube technology), the Schottky diode (where the depletion layer occurring in it is called the Schottky barrier), the Schottky vacancies (or Schottky defects), the Schottky anomaly (a peak value of the heat capacity) and the Mott-Schottky equation (also Langmuir-Schottky space charge law) were named after him. He conducted research on electrical noise mechanisms (shot noise), space charge, especially in electron tubes, and the barrier layer in semiconductors, which were important for the development of copper oxide rectifiers and transistors.

== Early life ==
Schottky&#x27;s father was mathematician Friedrich Hermann Schottky (1851–1935). Schottky had one sister and one brother. His father was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Zurich in 1882, and Schottky was born four years later. The family then moved back to Germany in 1892, where his father took up an appointment at the University of Marburg.
Schottky graduated from the Steglitz Gymnasium in Berlin in 1904. He completed his B.S. degree in physics at the Frederick William University Berlin in 1908, and he completed his PhD in physics at this university in 1912, studying under Max Planck and Heinrich Rubens, with a thesis entitled: .

== Career ==
Schottky&#x27;s postdoctoral period was spent at University of Jena (1912–14). He then lectured at the University of Würzburg (1919–23). He became a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rostock (1923–27). For two considerable periods of time, Schottky worked at the Siemens Research laboratories (1914–19 and 1927–58).

His research group moved in 1943 to Pretzfeld in Upper Franconia during World War II. This was also the trigger for the establishment of a semiconductor laboratory of the Siemens-Schuckert-Werke in the castle of Pretzfeld in 1946 until 1955, then he worked in Erlangen until 1958. The physicist lived in Pretzfeld until his death in 1976, where he was also buried.

== Inventions ==
In 1924, Schottky co-invented the ribbon microphone along with Erwin Gerlach. The idea was that a very fine ribbon suspended in a magnetic field could generate electric signals. This led to the invention of the ribbon loudspeaker by using it in the reverse order, but it was not practical until high flux permanent magnets became available in the late 1930s.

== Major scientific achievements ==
In 1914, Schottky developed the well-known classical formula, written here as
: formula_1.

This computes the interaction energy between a point charge &quot;q&quot; and a &quot;flat&quot; metal surface, when the charge is at a distance &quot;x&quot; from the surface. Owing to the method of its derivation, this interaction is called the &quot;image potential energy&quot; (image PE). Schottky based his work on earlier work by Lord Kelvin relating to the image PE for a sphere. Schottky&#x27;s image PE has become a standard component in simple models of the barrier to motion, &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), experienced by an electron on approaching a metal surface or a metal–semiconductor interface from the inside. (This &quot;M&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the quantity that appears when the one-dimensional, one-particle, Schrödinger equation is written in the form
: formula_2
Here, formula_3 is the reduced Planck constant, and &quot;m&quot; is the electron mass.)

The image PE is usually combined with terms relating to an applied electric field &quot;F&quot; and to the height &quot;h&quot; (in the absence of any field) of the barrier. This leads to the following expression for the dependence of the barrier energy on distance &quot;x&quot;, measured from the &quot;electrical surface&quot; of the metal, into the vacuum or into the semiconductor:
: formula_4
Here, &quot;e&quot; is the elementary positive charge, &quot;ε&quot;0 is the electric constant and &quot;ε&quot;r is the relative permittivity of the second medium (=1 for vacuum). In the case of a metal–semiconductor junction, this is called a Schottky barrier; in the case of the metal-vacuum interface, this is sometimes called a Schottky–Nordheim barrier. In many contexts, &quot;h&quot; has to be taken equal to the local work function &quot;φ&quot;.

This Schottky–Nordheim barrier (SN barrier) has played an important role in the theories of thermionic emission and of field electron emission. Applying the field causes lowering of the barrier, and thus enhances the emission current in thermionic emission. This is called the &quot;Schottky effect&quot;, and the resulting emission regime is called &quot;Schottky emission&quot;.

In 1923 Schottky suggested (incorrectly) that the experimental phenomenon then called autoelectronic emission and now called field electron emission resulted when the barrier was pulled down to zero. In fact, the effect is due to wave-mechanical tunneling, as shown by Fowler and Nordheim in 1928. But the SN barrier has now become the standard model for the tunneling barrier.

Later, in the context of semiconductor devices, it was suggested that a similar barrier should exist at the junction of a metal and a semiconductor. Such barriers are now widely known as Schottky barriers, and considerations apply to the transfer of electrons across them that are analogous to the older considerations of how electrons are emitted from a metal into vacuum. (Basically, several emission regimes exist, for different combinations of field and temperature. The different regimes are governed by different approximate formulae.)

When the whole behaviour of such interfaces is examined, it is found that they can act (asymmetrically) as a special form of electronic diode, now called a Schottky diode. In this context, the metal–semiconductor junction is known as a &quot;Schottky (rectifying) contact&quot;.

Schottky&#x27;s contributions in surface science/emission electronics and in semiconductor-device theory now form a significant and pervasive part of the background to these subjects. It could possibly be argued that – perhaps because they are in the area of technical physics – they are not as generally well recognized as they ought to be.

== Awards ==
He was awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Hughes Medal in 1936 for his discovery of the shot effect (spontaneous current variations in high-vacuum discharge tubes, called by him the &quot;Schrot effect&quot;: literally, the &quot;small shot effect&quot;) in thermionic emission and his invention of the screen-grid tetrode and a superheterodyne method of receiving wireless signals.
1962, he was awarded with the Carl-Friedrich-Gauss-Medal.
In 1964 he received the Werner von Siemens Ring honoring his ground-breaking work on the physical understanding of many phenomena that led to many important technical appliances, among them tube amplifiers and semiconductors.

== Controversy ==
The invention of superheterodyne is usually attributed to Edwin Armstrong. However, Schottky published an article in the Proceedings of the IEEE that may indicate he had invented and patented something similar in Germany in 1918.
The Frenchman Lucien Lévy had filed a claim earlier than either Armstrong or Schottky, and eventually his patent was recognized in the US and Germany.

== Legacy ==

The Walter Schottky Institute for semiconductor research and the Walter Schottky Prize for outstanding achievements in solid state physics are named after him. The Walter Schottky House of the RWTH Aachen University and the Walter Schottky Building of the of Applied Sciences in Nuremberg are also named after him. The &quot;Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Systems and Device Technology&quot; is located in the Schottky-Street in Erlangen.

<text>The Highlands Services Act 1715, also known as the Disarming Act 1715 (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. 54), was an 18th-century Act of Parliament of Great Britain that was enacted to curtail Jacobitism among the Scottish clans in the Scottish Highlands after the Jacobite rising of 1715. The new law, which came into effect on 1 November 1716, aimed at &quot;securing the peace of the highlands in Scotland&quot;. It outlawed anyone in defined parts of Scotland from having &quot;in his or their custody, use, or bear, broad sword, poignard, whinger, or durk, side pistol, gun, or other warlike weapon&quot; unless authorised.

However, the act proved ineffectual at enforcing the ban. In 1725 a new act was passed that for &quot;disarming the highlands in that part of Great Britain called Scotland; and for the better securing the peace and quiet of that part of the kingdom&quot;. This new law was enforced by Major-General George Wade, who used it to successfully confiscate a significant number of weapons. Wade&#x27;s efforts to confiscate weapons of war from was proven by the number of antiquated weapons utilised by Jacobites who answered the call when Charles Edward Stuart began the Jacobite rising of 1745 at Glenfinnan in 1745. Nevertheless, Jacobite Army troops quickly acquired many of Brown Bess muskets and bayonets after their victory at the Battle of Prestonpans.

The main articles of the Disarming Act were further strengthened in the Act of Proscription 1746 following the defeat of Bonnie Prince Charlie at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.
