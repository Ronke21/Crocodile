<doc id="241984" wikidata="Q2294744" url="?curid=241984" title="Videl">
<text> is a fictional character from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media franchise. Created by Akira Toriyama, she first appears in Chapter 421 of the &quot;Dragon Ball manga&quot; originally published in Issue 23 of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; on May 11, 1993. Her name is a play on words with her father&#x27;s name Mr. Satan. Within the series, she is adept in martial arts like her father and using her abilities to fight crime in the city. She is the love interest of Gohan and plays an important role during the story arc where he is the lead character of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. When Gohan appears as a costumed vigilante known as the Great Saiyaman, she quickly figures out his identity, and blackmails him into teaching her new techniques using her &quot;ki&quot;. After the main antagonist of the story arc Majin Buu is defeated, the two establish a settled lifestyle and later have a daughter named Pan.

Videl&#x27;s reception has been generally positive with series fans, whereas commentators have mixed views about her relevance as a character. As one of the few major female &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters, her role in the series as well as other &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media has been variously described as important or inconsequential by commentators.

==Development==
Like many &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; characters whose names are puns, the character&#x27;s name is an anagram of devil as her father&#x27;s name is Mr. Satan; he is known as Hercule in edited versions of the English dub and in the English manga published by Viz Media. While she is training with Gohan for the World Martial Arts Tournament, Videl mentions that her mother died. Otherwise, Videl&#x27;s mother is never named or discussed within the series, though Toriyama suggested that her mother is a beautiful singer named &quot;Miguel&quot; (ミゲル, &quot;migeru&quot;), based on the notion of an unconventional marriage between her (an &quot;archangel&quot;) and him (a &quot;devil&quot;). In keeping with the theme of her naming convention, the numerical registration identifier for Videl&#x27;s vehicle registration plate is 666.

Unlike her father, who is depicted as a showboating yet cowardly comic relief character, Videl is characterized with more heroic traits and displays an admirable fighting potential. Her hairstyle went through multiple drafts before the final design of twin pigtails was chosen in 1992, though the alternate hair designs have been used for other characters in the series, including Bulma.

===Portrayal===
Videl is voiced by Yūko Minaguchi in the original Japanese anime, and by Shino Kakinuma in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; Kai. In English localizations, Videl is voiced by Moneca Stori in the Ocean dub, Kara Edwards in the Funimation dub, and Erika Harlacher in the Bang Zoom! Entertainment dub. Minaguchi and Edwards are the most consistent voice actresses for the majority of Videl&#x27;s appearances in video games and other media.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;===
Videl first appears as a headstrong, tomboyish vigilante who assists the police force of Satan City. Gohan, her classmate at Orange Star High School, soon learns that she is the daughter of Mr. Satan, who took credit for his defeat of the superpowered villain Cell years ago and is celebrated worldwide as a hero. While she is raised with celebrity and fame surrounding her, her father is very protective of her, particularly with respect to her interactions with boys. She grew up learning martial arts in order to emulate her father, and uses her fighting abilities in her crimefighting activities.

She becomes suspicious of Gohan after she notices him at school, and tails him in order to learn more about him. Videl eventually discovers Gohan&#x27;s secret identity as the Great Saiyaman; realizing Gohan is more powerful than he seems, she blackmails him into teaching her combat techniques using her knowledge of his secret identity. In a matter of days she learns how to fly by utilizing her &quot;ki&quot; and surpasses her father in fighting ability. She also gradually develops a liking for Gohan, even cutting her hair at his innocuous suggestion that long hair may get in the way of a fight. Videl later enters the 25th Tenka&#x27;ichi Budokai martial arts tournament, but is brutally beaten to near-death by a magically empowered man named Spopovitch in a slanted match, enraging Gohan and sparking a chain of events which leads to the revival of the ancient primordial creature Majin Buu.

Videl is devastated when she learns that Gohan is presumed dead as a result of his initial defeat by Buu. Along with the family members and associates of the series&#x27; main characters, Videl is relocated to Kami&#x27;s Lookout after Buu goes on a murderous rampage throughout the world, but is later killed when Buu discovers and reaches the refuge. Videl is later returned to life through the power of the Namekian Dragon Balls, and is reunited with Gohan and her father. By the ending of the original series following a ten-year gap, Videl is married to Gohan and they have a daughter named Pan.

===&quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
Videl&#x27;s appearance is redesigned for &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, which takes place chronologically after the defeat of Majin Buu but prior to the ending of the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. During Bulma&#x27;s birthday party, Videl reveals that she is pregnant, and participates in a ritual on behalf of her unborn daughter Pan to enable Goku to transform into a Super Saiyan God, where her hair briefly turns golden yellow like that of a Super Saiyan. Pan is born later in the series and makes recurring appearances as a minor supporting character cared for by her mother.

A noteworthy subplot in the anime version of &quot;Super&quot; involves Videl being coveted by famed actor Barry Kahn, who is corrupted by an alien organism and later defeated by Gohan who revives his Great Saiyaman gimmick.

=== In Akira Toriyama&#x27;s films===
Videl appears as a supporting character in multiple films with the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; branding. In &quot;Broly – Second Coming&quot;, she accompanies Gohan, Goten and Trunks in their search for the Dragon Balls and encounters a revived Broly. In &quot;Fusion Reborn&quot; she assists Chi-Chi with domestic chores, and later Gohan with fending off a horde of revived villains from the series&#x27; history; in &quot;Wrath of the Dragon&quot;, she pursues criminals as a costumed vigilante alongside Gohan, and calls herself the &quot;Great Saiyaman 2&quot; or &quot;Great Saiyawoman&quot;.

Her participation in the Super Saiyan God ritual in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; is an adaptation of a similar scene from the 2013 film &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;. In this version, Gohan discovers that Videl is pregnant with their child after she is accidentally injured by a pistol-wielding Mai from the Pilaf Gang.

Videl makes a minor appearance in &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, in which she requests Piccolo to pick up Pan from school as both she and Gohan were too busy.

===Other appearances===
Videl appears in the 2008 &quot;Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!&quot; television special, and the 2013 crossover show &quot;Dream 9 Toriko &amp; One Piece &amp; Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!&quot;. Videl plays a minor role in the &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; series, and is often seen in the company of her mother-in-law Chi-Chi. Videl and her husband are later possessed by Baby, and attack their daughter Pan when she attempts to help other civilians who are under Baby&#x27;s influence, but they are intercepted by Uub and are later cured from Baby&#x27;s influence. She is last seen when Goku says goodbye to everyone and departs the mortal world with Shenron at the end of the series.

Videl has appeared in several &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; video games, often as a playable character: examples include the &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai&quot; series, the &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&quot;, &quot;Super Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Xenoverse&quot; and its sequel. She appears in post-launch downloadable content DLC for 2018&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot;, initially as a match commentator in March 2018, and later as a playable character in 2019. Videl&#x27;s unique gameplay mechanics reflect her portrayal in the original source material as a skilled human martial artist who is underpowered compared to other recurring series characters, but nevertheless is bolstered by her partnership with Gohan. Videl is the only character in &quot;FighterZ&quot; with an alternate appearance: players may toggle between her default short haired look and her original twin pigtail hairstyle.

==Reception==
Videl is one of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise&#x27;s most popular female characters. In a 2004 popularity poll participated by Japanese voters, Videl was ranked the twentieth most popular character of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. Videl remains a popular subject for cosplay activities and fan art by &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; fandom.

In his review of the DVD compilation of the original anime&#x27;s season 8, Anime News Network&#x27;s Theron Martin criticized the naming convention of the daughter of a man named Mr. Satan as &quot;corny&quot; and part of the series&#x27; &quot;grating jokes&quot;. Martin found that Videl&#x27;s voice actress for the Funimation English dub, Kara Edwards, were among the few weak performances in the series, which surprised him as he considered her performance as Goten to be vastly superior.

Some commentators have discussed Videl&#x27;s role within the context of the overall portrayal of female characters in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series. Antonio Sánchez-Migallón from &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; lamented that Videl went from a strong heroic character who is determined to defend her city as a vigilante to emulating her mother-in-law as a domesticated housewife whose only function is to look after Pan and her home. Similarly, Martin said Videl is too underutilized to make much of an impact. Conversely, Valdez praised Videl&#x27;s characterization as a supportive wife to Gohan and dedicated mother to Pan during the Barry Kahn subplot in &quot;Super&quot;. In response to a Valencian television network&#x27;s decision to ban the airing of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; due to allegations of its sexist content, Maigo Gomez from &quot;GeeksTerra&quot; argued that Videl is one of several examples of a strong female character with agency in the series, as opposed to a damsel in distress who is in need of rescuing.

Ian Walker from &quot;Kotaku&quot; reported that multiple professional esports competitors praised Videl&#x27;s playable appearance in &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot; for her “fast, tricky” style as well as her strong &quot;mix ups&quot;, which refers to a combination of different attacks that require the opposing player to employ specific defenses to guard against. On the other hand, Kevin Cardignan from &quot;PC Invasion&quot; claimed that Videl is one of the worst characters in &quot;FighterZ&quot; as she lacks a standard reflect mechanic and could only dodge instead, rendering her &quot;susceptible to levels of pressure&quot; which can be easily ignored by other characters.

<doc id="241985" wikidata="Q2904080" url="?curid=241985" title="Montreal Biodome">
<text>The Montreal Biodome () is a museum of enclosed ecosystems located at Olympic Park in the Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, that allows visitors to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas. 

It is one of two large-scale enclosed ecosystem structures in the Western Hemisphere, the other being Biosphere 2 in Tucson, Arizona. However, unlike the latter, the Montreal Biodome was designed primarily as a museum, resembles but is fundamentally different from a closed ecological system such as Biosphere 2.

The building was originally constructed for the 1976 Olympic Games as a velodrome (cycling stadium) with 2,600 seats. It hosted both track cycling and judo events. Renovations on the building began in 1989 and in 1992 the indoor nature exhibit was opened.

The Montreal Biodome is one of four facilities that make part of the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, Space for Life, which also includes the Montreal Insectarium, Montreal Botanical Garden, and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. It is an accredited member of both the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and the Canada&#x27;s Accredited Zoos and Aquariums association (CAZA).

==History==
The building was designed by French architect Roger Taillibert as part of his larger plan for an Olympic park that included the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Olympic pool. The venue was a combined velodrome and judo facility. Construction of the building began in August 1973, and the facility was officially opened in April 1976.

The velodrome, along with the accompanying Olympic pool, inspired Tallibert&#x27;s later designs for Luxembourg&#x27;s National Sports and Culture Centre.

In 1988, a feasibility study was conducted for converting the velodrome into a biodome. Construction started in 1989, and the facility was opened to the public on 18 June 1992 as the Montreal Biodome.

In the summer of 2003, the Biodome installed an audio guide system that lets visitors get information about what they are viewing, and also provides statistics to the facility about what the visitors find most interesting. Visitors can rent a receiver programmed to receive French, Spanish, or English for adults, or French or English for children.

==Exhibits==
The facility allows visitors to walk through replicas of four ecosystems found in the Americas:
* The Tropical Forest is a replica of the South American rainforest.
* The Laurentian Forest is a replica of the North American wilderness.
* The Saint Lawrence Marine Eco-system is an estuary habitat modelled on the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
* The Sub-Polar Region is a habitat that is divided into Arctic and Antarctic.

All the exhibits are housed inside the former velodrome that was used for the cycling and judo events of the 1976 Summer Olympics, with each of the four environments taking up a portion of the stadium. A variety of animals live in each simulated habitat, ranging from the macaws in the Tropical Forest, to the lynx in the Laurentian Forest, to the penguins in the Antarctic and the different kinds of fish that inhabit the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. As well, two new species have been discovered living in the Biodome: the acarian &quot;Copidognathus biodomus&quot; in the simulated estuary in 1996, and the bacterium &quot;Nitratireductor aquibiodomus&quot; in the water reprocessing system in 2003.

==Renovation==
In October 2015, it was announced that both the Biodome and the Insectarium would be closing their doors to the public from September 2016 to December 2017, in order to be renovated, as part of the city of Montreal&#x27;s 375th anniversary; however, in August 2016, the mayor of Montreal cancelled the contract to renovate the Biodome, because the bid results received by the city were much higher than the initial estimates. The facelift project went back to a bidding process. The Biodome closed for renovations on 2 April 2018. The reopening was pushed back from September 2019 to December 2019, and then to the spring of 2020 due to a shortage of supplies and specialized labourers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused additional delays, and the Biodome finally reopened to the public on 31 August 2020. A mobile app was also released, offering augmented reality features and more in-depth information about the different plants and animals.

<text>Maxim (stylized in all caps) is an international men&#x27;s magazine, devised and launched in the United Kingdom in 1995, but based in New York City since 1997. It is known for its photography of actors, singers and female models whose careers are at their peak. &quot;Maxim&quot; has a circulation of about 9 million readers each month. Maxim Digital reaches more than 4 million unique viewers each month. &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine publishes 16 editions, sold in 75 countries worldwide.

== History ==
&quot;Maxim&quot; was founded by Felix Dennis (1947–2014) in 1995 and expanded to the United States in 1997.

In 1999, MaximOnline.com (now maxim.com) was created. It contains content not included in the print version, and focuses on the same general topics, along with exclusive sections and videos.

In December 2001, Editorial Televisa published the Spanish-language edition of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine for Latin America and the Hispanic communities of the United States, its first cover was Colombian model and actress Sofía Vergara.

On February 5, 2005, Maxim Radio, featuring male-oriented talk programming, debuted on Sirius Satellite Radio. Following the Sirius-XM merger in late 2008, the &quot;Maxim&quot; brand was dropped, and the channel is now known as Sirius XM Stars Too.

Since 2005, in Argentina, the Argentinian edition of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine began to adapt and approximate the styles of the American adult magazines &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Hustler&quot;, publishing photos of Argentinian models in thongs and topless.

On June 5, 2006, the magazine announced plans to build a casino on the Las Vegas Strip north of Circus Circus, but the casino plan failed after local condominium owners complained that the proposed casino would ruin their view. The land was sold to MGM Mirage.

On June 15, 2007, private equity firm Quadrangle Group, along with long-time media executive Kent Brownridge, announced the acquisition of the parent company of &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, and MaximOnline.com in the United States, under the name Alpha Media Group. As of April 23, 2009, Dennis Publishing has announced that it will no longer produce a print edition of &quot;Maxim&quot; in the United Kingdom, though the website for the UK version will remain.

Quadrangle Group gave up on its investment in Alpha Media Group in August 2009, making Cerberus Capital Management the majority partner. In 2013, Alpha announced the sale of &quot;Maxim&quot; to the newly created Darden Media Group, but Darden was unable to raise the money. Calvin Darden Jr. was later charged with fraud relating to the transaction.

Between 2010 and 2012, &quot;Maxim&quot; eliminated two issues, going from 12 issues a year to 10, and decreased its circulation numbers by 20%, from a reported 2.5 million to only 2.0 million.

The Argentinian edition of the magazine &quot;Maxim&quot; stopped circulating in March 2013 in Argentina and its last cover was the Argentinian model Valeria Degenaro.

On February 27, 2014, entrepreneur Sardar Biglari, the founder of Biglari Holdings and Biglari Capital, purchased &quot;Maxim&quot;. In September 2014, Kate Lanphear became editor-in-chief. During Lanphear&#x27;s tenure, the September 2015 issue featured actor Idris Elba on its cover, marking the first time that the magazine did not have a woman on the cover. Lanphear left the magazine in November 2015.

In January 2016, Biglari officially took over as editor-in-chief of &quot;Maxim&quot;, though a &quot;Maxim&quot; staffer said that the new masthead title just formalized what had always been clear since Biglari&#x27;s purchase; Biglari exercises full editorial control over &quot;Maxim&quot;. At one point in 2015, the staffer said, Biglari decided to throw out a nearly complete version of the December issue to completely redesign the magazine. On January 13, 2016, Gilles Bensimon joined Biglari as a special creative director.

The Indonesian edition of the magazine &quot;Maxim&quot; stopped circulating in August 2017 in Indonesia and its last cover was the Australian model Jessica Gomes.

== MaximBet ==
In April 2021, Maxim collaborated with international sports betting operator, Carousel Group, to create MaximBet, a licensed iGaming and sports betting services provider. In September 2021, MaximBet made its debut in Colorado, when they partnered with Johnny Nolon&#x27;s Saloon and Gambling Emporium. In late September 2021, MaximBet expanded its operations and its brand launched in Indiana.

In April 2022, just after the Major League Baseball lockout ended, MaximBet entered into an endorsement deal with an active MLB player, Charlie Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies, as a brand ambassador.

In May 2022, Nicki Minaj was named as the creative director and global ambassador of MaximBet.

== Events and controversies ==

In 2004, the Gender Issues Centre, an on-campus feminist organization at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario, protested an on-campus &quot;Thunder Bay Boob Idol&quot; event sponsored by &quot;Maxim&quot; and Coors Light. The Centre described &quot;Maxim&quot; as consisting of &quot;sexist bravado and racist imagery&quot;. In 2006, Alok Jha of &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized &quot;Maxim&quot; for encouraging excessive alcohol consumption and sexual objectification of women.

In June 2007, Israeli diplomat David Saranga invited &quot;Maxim&quot; to the country. In what came to be known as &quot;beers and babes&quot;, the magazine did photo shoots of near-naked Israeli women who serve in the army. The campaign drew an angry reaction from lawmaker Colette Avital, a former diplomat who served as Israel&#x27;s consul-general in New York City in the 1990s. Professor John H. Brown of Georgetown University described the spread as the first event in a new branch of public diplomacy.

In February 2008, &quot;Maxim&quot; was criticized by The Black Crowes for rating their upcoming CD, &quot;Warpaint&quot;, without hearing the entire album. Black Crowes manager Pete Angelus said, &quot;&quot;Maxim&quot;″s actions seem to completely lack journalistic integrity and intentionally mislead their readership.&quot; According to Crowes, the magazine stated in an email, &quot;Of course, we always prefer to hearing music, but sometimes there are big albums that we don&#x27;t want to ignore that aren&#x27;t available to hear, which is what happened with the Crowes. It&#x27;s either an educated guess preview or no coverage at all, so in this case we chose the former.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s editorial director James Kaminsky later apologized, stating, &quot;It is &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s editorial policy to assign star ratings only to those albums that have been heard in their entirety. Unfortunately, that policy was not followed in the March 2008 issue of our magazine and we apologize to our readers.&quot; Facing more criticism over rating albums without listening to them, &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine maintains it was previewing CDs in its March 2008 issue, not reviewing them, and the mistake was to include star ratings.

== International editions ==

&quot;Maxim&quot; has launched international editions of its magazines since 1995. In 2006, it has launched its 26th and 27th international editions in Serbia and Greece, where it is published by Attica Media. Notably, the magazine has been circulating editions in South Korea, Indonesia (defunct), India (defunct), Japan, Portugal (as &quot;Maxmen&quot;), the United States, Thailand, France (as&quot; Maximal&quot;), Russia, Turkey, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Argentina (defunct), Italy, Canada, Poland, Brazil, Germany, Australia, Mexico (defunct), Colombia (defunct) and the Philippines.

<doc id="241994" wikidata="Q212348" url="?curid=241994" title="Aberdeen Angus">
<text>The Aberdeen Angus, sometimes simply Angus, is a Scottish breed of small beef cattle. It derives from cattle native to the counties of Aberdeen, Banff, Kincardine and Angus in north-eastern Scotland. In 2018 the breed accounted for over 17% of the beef production in the United Kingdom.

The Angus is naturally polled and solid black or red; the udder may be white. The cattle have been exported to many countries of the world; there are large populations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South America and the United States, where it has developed into two separate and distinct breeds, the American Angus and Red Angus. In some countries it has been bred to be taller than the native Scottish stock.

Its conservation status worldwide is &quot;not at risk&quot;; in the United Kingdom the original Native Aberdeen Angus – cattle not influenced by cross-breeding with imported stock – is listed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust as &quot;at risk&quot;.

== History ==

Aberdeen Angus cattle have been recorded in north-eastern Scotland since at least the sixteenth century. For some time before the 1800s, the hornless cattle in Angus were called &quot;Angus Doddies&quot;, while those in the historic province of Buchan (later part of Aberdeenshire) were known as &quot;Buchan Humlies&quot;, both &quot;doddie&quot; and &quot;humlie&quot; meaning “polled.”

In 1824, William McCombie of Tillyfour, later the Member of Parliament for West Aberdeenshire, began to improve the stock and is regarded today as the father of the breed.

The breed was officially recognised in 1835, and was initially registered together with the Galloway in the Polled Herd Book. A society was formed in 1879. The cattle became commonplace throughout the British Isles in the mid-twentieth century.

=== Argentina ===
As stated in the fourth volume of the Herd Book of the UK&#x27;s Angus, this breed was introduced to Argentina in 1879 when &quot;&quot;Don&quot; Carlos Guerrero&quot; imported one bull and two cows for his &quot;Estancia&quot; &quot;Charles&quot; located in Juancho, Partido de General Madariaga, Provincia de Buenos Aires. The bull was born on 19 April 1878; named &quot;Virtuoso 1626&quot; and raised by Colonel Ferguson. The cows were named &quot;Aunt Lee 4697&quot; raised by J. James and &quot;Cinderela 4968&quot; raised by R. Walker and were both born in 1878, on 31 January and 23 April respectively.

=== Australia ===

Angus cattle were first introduced to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) in the 1820s, and to the southern mainland in 1840. The breed is now found in all Australian states and territories with calves registered with Angus Australia in 2010.

=== Canada ===

In 1876 William Brown, a professor of agriculture and then superintendent of the experimental farm at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission by the government of Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, Gladiolus, and a cow, Eyebright, bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On 12 January 1877, Eyebright gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls and cows, eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881.

=== United States ===

On 17 May 1873, George Grant brought four Angus bulls, without any cows, to Victoria, Kansas. These were seen as unusual as the normal American cattle consisted of Shorthorns and Longhorns, and the bulls were used only in crossbreeding. However, the farmers noticed the good qualities of these bulls, and afterwards many more cattle of both sexes were imported.

On 21 November 1883, the American Angus Association was founded in Chicago, Illinois. The first herd book was published in March 1885. At this time both red and black animals were registered without distinction. However, in 1917 the Association barred the registering of red and other coloured animals in an effort to promote a solid black breed.

The Red Angus Association of America was founded in 1954 by breeders of Red Angus cattle. It was formed because the breeders had had their cattle struck off the herd book for not conforming to the changed breed standard regarding colour.

===Germany===

A separate breed was cross bred in Germany called the German Angus. It is a cross between the Angus and several different cattle such as the German Black Pied Cattle, Gelbvieh, and Fleckvieh. The cattle are usually larger than the Angus and appear in black and red colours.

== Characteristics ==

Because of their native environment, the cattle are very hardy and can survive the Scottish winters, which are often harsh, with snowfall and storms. Cows weigh about and bulls some . Bulls may be used on dairy cows to produce a beef calf. The cattle are naturally polled and may be either black or red. They reach maturity earlier than some other native British breeds such as the Hereford or North Devon. 

The cattle have a large muscle content and are regarded as medium-sized. In Japan the meat is prized for its marbling.

Among the recessive genetic defects that can affect the cattle are: arthrogryposis multiplex (&quot;curly calf&quot;); neuropathic hydrocephalus (&quot;water head&quot;); contractural arachnodactyly or &quot;fawn calf syndrome&quot;; dwarfism; osteoporosis; and notomelia.

== Use ==

The Aberdeen Angus is reared for beef. The meat can be marketed as superior due to its marbled appearance. This has led to many markets, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom to adopt it into the mainstream. Angus cattle can also be used in cross-breeding to reduce the likelihood of dystocia (difficult calving) or, because of their dominant polled gene, to produce polled calves.

<text>The Chauchat (&quot;show-sha&quot;, ) was the standard light machine gun or &quot;machine rifle&quot; of the French Army during World War I (1914–18). Its official designation was &quot;Fusil Mitrailleur Modele 1915 CSRG&quot; (&quot;Machine Rifle Model 1915 CSRG&quot;). Beginning in June 1916, it was placed into regular service with French infantry, where the troops called it the FM Chauchat, after Colonel Louis Chauchat, the main contributor to its design. The Chauchat in 8mm Lebel was also extensively used in 1917–18 by the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), where it was officially designated as the &quot;Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)&quot;. A total of 262,000 Chauchats were manufactured between December 1915 and November 1918, including 244,000 chambered for the 8mm Lebel service cartridge, making it the most widely manufactured automatic weapon of World War I. The armies of eight other nations—Belgium, Finland, Greece, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia—also used the Chauchat machine rifle in fairly large numbers during and after World War I.

The Chauchat was one of the first light, automatic rifle-caliber weapons designed to be carried and fired by a single operator and an assistant, without a heavy tripod or a team of gunners. It set a precedent for several subsequent 20th-century firearm projects, being a portable, yet full-power automatic weapon built inexpensively and in very large numbers. The Chauchat combined a pistol grip, an in-line stock, a detachable magazine, and a selective fire capability in a compact package of manageable weight (20 pounds, 9 kilograms) for a single soldier. Furthermore, it could be routinely fired from the hip and while walking (marching fire). The Chauchat is the only mass produced fully-automatic weapon actuated by long recoil, a Browning-designed system already applied in 1906 to the Remington Model 8 semi-automatic rifle: extraction and ejection of the empties takes place when the barrel returns forward, while the bolt is retained in the rear position. Afterwards the barrel trips a lever which releases the bolt and allows it to chamber another round.

The muddy trenches of northern France exposed a number of weaknesses in the Chauchat&#x27;s design. Construction had been simplified to facilitate mass production, resulting in low quality of many metal parts. The magazines in particular were the cause of about 75% of the stoppages or cessations of fire; they were made of thin metal and open on one side, allowing for the entry of mud and dust. The weapon also ceased to function when overheated, the barrel sleeve remaining in the retracted position until the gun had cooled off. Consequently, in September 1918, barely two months before the Armistice of November 11, the A.E.F. in France had already initiated the process of replacing the Chauchat with the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Shortly after World War I, the French army replaced the Chauchat with the new gas-operated Mle 1924 light machine gun. 
It was mass manufactured during World War I by two reconverted civilian plants: &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Sidarme&quot;. Besides the 8mm Lebel version, the Chauchat machine rifle was also manufactured in U.S. .30-06 Springfield and in 7.65×53mm Argentine Mauser caliber to arm the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.) and the Belgian Army, respectively. The Belgian military did not experience difficulties with their Chauchats in 7.65mm Mauser and kept them in service into the early 1930s, as did the Polish Army. Conversely, the Chauchat version in U.S. .30-06 made by &quot;Gladiator&quot; for the A.E.F., the Model 1918, proved to be fundamentally defective and had to be withdrawn from service. The Chauchat has a poor reputation in some quarters; the .30-06 version in particular is by some experts considered the worst machine gun ever fielded.

==History==
The design of the Chauchat dates back to 1903, and its long recoil operation is based on the John Browning-designed Remington Model 8 semi-automatic rifle of 1906, not (as so often repeated in the past) on the later designs (1910) of Rudolf Frommer, the Hungarian inventor of the commercial Frommer Stop pistol. The Chauchat machine rifle project was initiated between 1903 and 1910 in a French Army weapon research facility located near Paris: Atelier de Construction de Puteaux (APX). This development was aiming at creating a very light, portable automatic weapon served by one man only, yet firing the 8 mm Lebel service ammunition. The project was led from the beginning by Colonel Louis Chauchat, a graduate from Ecole Polytechnique, assisted by senior armorer Charles Sutter. Not less than eight trial prototypes were tested at APX, between 1903 and 1909. As a result, a small series (100 guns) of 8 mm Lebel CS (Chauchat-Sutter) machine rifles was ordered in 1911, then manufactured between 1913 and 1914 by Manufacture d&#x27;armes de Saint-Étienne (MAS). Because they were light, they were used temporarily during the early part of World War I to arm observation crews on French military aircraft. Only one CS machine rifle is known to have survived in a Prague museum.

In 1914, when World War I broke out, French troops did not operate any light machine gun. It was clear that this type of weapon had become indispensable in modern warfare, because of the increase in firepower it could provide to an infantry section. Spurred by General Joseph Joffre, it was decided to adopt the Chauchat, above all else because the pre-war CS (Chauchat-Sutter) machine rifle was already in existence, thoroughly tested, and designed to fire the 8mm Lebel service ammunition. Furthermore, due to its projected low manufacturing costs and relative simplicity, the newly adopted (1915) CSRG machine rifle could be mass-produced by a converted peacetime industrial plant. The term CSRG is made up of the initials of Chauchat, Sutter, Ribeyrolles and Gladiator, the respective manufacturers. Paul Ribeyrolles was the general manager of the Gladiator company, a peacetime manufacturer of motor cars, motorcycles, and bicycles located in Pre-Saint-Gervais (a northern suburb of Paris). The fairly large Gladiator factory was thus converted into an arms manufacturer in 1915 and became the principal industrial producer of Chauchat machine rifles during World War I. Later on, in 1918, a subsidiary of Compagnie des forges et acieries de la marine et d&#x27;Homecourt named SIDARME and located in Saint-Chamond, Loire, also participated in the mass manufacture of CSRGs.

==Design details==

The Chauchat machine rifle or &quot;automatic rifle&quot; functioned on the long barrel recoil principle with a gas assist.

The Chauchat machine rifle (CSRG) delivered to the French Army fired the 8mm Lebel cartridge at the slow rate of 240 rounds per minute. At , the gun was much lighter than the contemporary portable light machine guns of the period, such as the Hotchkiss M1909 Benét–Mercié machine gun and the Lewis gun. It was a selective fire weapon, either on automatic or semi-automatic mode.

The Chauchat&#x27;s construction was a mix of new, high quality components, re-used parts proven in other designs, and the shoddy and sub standard. This combination did not help in the reliability of the weapon. The recoiling barrel sleeve, as well as all the bolt moving parts, were precision milled from solid steel and always fully interchangeable. The barrels were standard Lebel rifle barrels that had been shortened from the muzzle end. The barrel radiators were made of ribbed cast aluminum. On the other hand, the outer breech housing was a simple tube, and the rest of the gun was built of stamped metal plates of mediocre quality. Side plate assemblies were held by screws that could become loose after prolonged firings. The sights were always misaligned on the Gladiator-made guns, creating severe aiming problems that had to be corrected by the gunners.

The exact number on record of Chauchat machine rifles manufactured between 1916 and the end of 1918 is 262,300. The Gladiator factory manufactured 225,700 CSRGs in 8 mm Lebel plus 19,000 in the U.S. caliber .30-06 between April 1916 and November 1918. SIDARME manufactured 18,600 CSRGs, exclusively in 8mm Lebel, between October 1917 and November 1918. The SIDARME-manufactured Chauchats were generally better finished and better functioning than those made by Gladiator. The French Army had a stock of 63,000 CSRG&#x27;s just before the Armistice.

The French military at the time considered the Chauchat&#x27;s performance as inferior in comparison to the reliable heavy Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. However, whereas the Hotchkiss was a weighty, tripod-mounted weapon, the Chauchat was a light, portable gun that could be mass-produced quickly, cheaply, and in very large numbers. It was also never intended to take the role of static defense of the heavy machine gun. On the contrary, it was designed to be a light, thus highly portable, automatic weapon that would increase the firepower of infantry squads while they progressed forward during assaults. A significant plus is that it could easily be fired while walking (marching fire), by hanging the Chauchat&#x27;s sling over a shoulder hook located onto the gunner&#x27;s upper left side of his Y–strap.

The CSRG 1915 Chauchat was operated with &quot;Balle D&quot; 8mm ammunition, which was standard for the French until 1932 when they went to an improved &quot;Balle N&quot; 8mm Lebel cartridge. The Chauchats, as they were retired, were not converted to the &quot;Balle N&quot;, and as a result, they do not operate well with the &quot;Balle N&quot; cartridge (French World War I weapons converted to &quot;Balle N&quot; will have a noticeable &quot;N&quot; markings). Only &quot;Balle D&quot; 8mm should be used in the Chauchat 1915. The quickest way to identify the different cartridge is that the &quot;Balle D&quot; bullet is brass colored while the &quot;Balle N&quot; is a shiny silver.

==Service==

The Mle 1915 Chauchat&#x27;s performance on the battlefield drew decidedly mixed reviews from the users when the war was stagnating in the mud of the trenches in 1916. This brought about a survey, regiment by regiment, requested by General Pétain in late 1916; the survey&#x27;s essential conclusion was that the open-sided half-moon magazines were defective and caused about two thirds of all stoppages. For instance, it was a common practice for the gunners to oil up the inside of the magazines to facilitate movement of the 8mm Lebel rounds. Also, loose earth, grit, and other particles easily entered the gun through these open-sided magazines, an ever-present risk in the muddy environment of the trenches. An insistence on using only good, undeformed magazines with strong springs was the most practical solution to this problem. Chauchat gunners were also known to load their magazines with 18 or 19 rounds, instead of the maximum 20, in order to avoid the dreaded first-round failure to feed. The Chauchat&#x27;s long recoil system is often cited as a source of excessive stress on the gunner when firing, though recent and extensive firing tests have demonstrated that it is the Chauchat&#x27;s ergonomics and its loose bipod, rather than its recoil, that makes it a difficult gun to keep on target beyond very short bursts. On most of the Gladiator-made guns, the sights also made the Chauchat shoot systematically too low and to the right, a failing which was soon recognized but never corrected. Overheating during uninterrupted periods of full automatic fire (about 120 rounds with the 8mm Lebel version) often resulted in the barrel sleeve assembly locking in the rear position due to thermal expansion, causing stoppage of fire until the gun had cooled off. Hence, French and US Army manuals recommended firing in short bursts or semi-auto. In 1918, the A.E.F. officially labeled the Chauchat in its user manuals as an &quot;automatic rifle&quot;, a product of mistranslation of the term &quot;Fusil Mitrailleur&quot;, instead of &quot;Machine Gun Rifle&quot;, a more accurate description.

===American service===
While rate of fire restrictions (250 rounds/minute) made the gun manageable in its 8mm Lebel version, the U.S. .30-06 version fired more powerful cartridges that exacerbated the problems of overheating. Furthermore, the 18,000 Chauchats in .30-06 delivered to the A.E.F. were not conversions of the French model. Rather, they were newly manufactured guns which had been delivered directly to the A.E.F. by the Gladiator factory. As documented from the original American and French military archives, most of these Mle 1918 Chauchats in .30-06 were flawed from the beginning due to incomplete chamber reaming and other dimensional defects acquired during the manufacturing process at the Gladiator factory. Very few .30-06 Chauchats reached the front lines of northern France; however, when they did, it was reportedly not uncommon for U.S. units to simply discard their Chauchats in favor of M1903 Springfield rifles and cease to function as an auto-rifle squad altogether. Whereas instruction manuals in both French and English for the 8mm Lebel Chauchat are still commonly found today, instruction manuals for the US 30-06 &quot;American Chauchat&quot; have never been seen in U.S. and French military archives or in private collections.

====Chauchat in American service====

After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) arrived in France without automatic weapons or field artillery. Consequently, it turned to its French ally to purchase ordnance. General Pershing chose the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun and the Chauchat machine rifle (designated as &quot;Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)&quot; by the AEF and nicknamed the &quot;Sho-Sho&quot; by the troops) to equip U.S. infantry. Between August 1917 and the November 11, 1918 Armistice with Germany, the Gladiator factory delivered to the AEF 16,000 Chauchats in 8 mm Lebel and, late in 1918, 19,000 Chauchats in .30-06.

While the performance of the M1915 Chauchat in 8 mm Lebel was combat-effective, judging by the numbers of decorated U.S. Chauchat gunners found in the U.S. Divisional Histories, the performance of the M1918 Chauchat in .30-06 was soon recognized as abysmal (and in large part the reason for the gun&#x27;s bad reputation). The most common problem was a failure to extract after the gun had fired only a few rounds and became slightly hot. A modern-day test firing of the M1918 .30-06 Chauchat was performed at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in July 1973, but no particular problem was described in the official report, which is accessible on open file. Conversely, an exhaustive firing test of the M1918 Chauchat in .30-06 was also carried out in 1994 near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, by R. Keller and W. Garofalo. Their testing, which is reported in &quot;The Chauchat Machine Rifle&quot; volume, did expose severe extraction problems caused by incorrect chamber measurements and other substandard manufacturing. During World War I, in 1918, the preserved U.S. archival record also documents that American inspectors at the Gladiator factory had rejected about 40% of the .30-06 Chauchat production, while the remaining 60% proved problematic when they reached the front lines. Supplies of the newly manufactured and superior M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) were allocated sparingly and only very late, during the Meuse-Argonne offensive, which began in late September 1918. Therefore, about 75% of the U.S. Divisions were still equipped with the Chauchat – in its original French M1915 version in 8 mm Lebel – at the time of the Armistice of November 11, 1918. It is also well documented that General Pershing had been holding back on the BAR until victory was certain, for fear it would be copied by Germany. However, it is also known that the very first BARs delivered had improperly tempered recoil springs, and had these guns been prematurely introduced during the summer of 1918, their employment may also have been problematic. One of the most significant accounts of the Chauchat&#x27;s poor performance was from then-lieutenant Lemuel Shepherd, who was quoted saying:

As documented by World War I veteran Laurence Stallings (in &quot;The Doughboys&quot;, 1963) and by U.S. Divisional Histories, the Medal of Honor was awarded to three American Chauchat gunners in 1918:
# Private Nels Wold (35th Division, 138th Infantry, KIA, posthumous)
# Private Frank Bart (2nd Division, 9th Infantry) 
# Private Thomas C. Neibaur (42nd Division, 107th Infantry)

===Improvements===
Several prototypes of dirt-proof, fully enclosed Chauchat magazines were successfully tested in May and June 1918, but came too late to be placed into service. Stronger open-sided standard magazines, as well as tailored canvas gun covers protecting the gun against mud during transport, had previously been issued in late 1917; as well as a flash hider. The initial two-man Chauchat team was considered effective and grew to a four-man squad by October 1917 (the squad leader, the gunner, the first ammo bearer who handled the magazines plus one additional ammo bearer). Both the gunner and the assistant gunner (&quot;pourvoyeur&quot;, ammo bearer) carried at all times a .32 ACP Ruby pistol with three magazines, each one loaded with 9 rounds, as part of their regular equipment. The squad leader and the magazine carrier were both equipped with a rifle or with a Berthier carbine. The additional men provided assistance in carrying loaded magazines, helping manage malfunctions, and protecting the gunner, but mainly to carry more ammunition; thus boosting the combat load. This is still the basic layout of a modern infantry squad or fire-team, with the suppressive fire as the center of its combat formations.

===Tactical Innovation===
The French infantry section/platoon took its modern form in the years 1916-1918. It was then equipped with six portable light machine guns (Chauchat) and four to six rifle grenade launchers (VB rifle grenade) and its &quot;voltigeurs&quot; started being equipped with semi-automatic rifles, some with scopes. This differentiation induces an interdependence of the men which increases the psychological resistance superior to that of the aligned bayonet-men of 1914. Above all, the infantry platoon can maneuver other than in line, as an articulated unit at intervals thanks to its autonomous combat groups. The qualitative leap in a few years is enormous and modern squads and platoons still function in the same manner, albeit with more sophisticated equipment such as portable radios and night vision devices.

A specially lightened assault order was introduced in June 1915. The pack was now to be left behind in the second line; instead, rations and spare ammunition were rolled up in a blanket and worn bandolier-style. Steel helmets were standard for the infantry in September 1915, in time for the Champagne offensive; standard issue for other arms occurred in October. Experience at Verdun showed how difficult it was to keep men in the front lines supplied with fresh water, so every man was given a second water bottle and a second haversack to carry necessities for a day or two of unsupported fighting; plus two gas masks (one in the ready position, one in a tin box); tools like an M1909 folding pick/shovel; extra ammunition and grenades, and sandbags for consolidating the objective.

The rifle grenadiers and bombers (hand grenadiers) each carried a special haversack, which held the grenades in individual pouches inside. The rifle grenade cup was carried in its own pouch attached to the user&#x27;s waistbelt. The men of the new fire and support teams were given new equipment for their spare ammunition. The Chauchat gunners each wore semi-circular pouches on the waistbelt, containing one spare magazine each, as well as a pack containing a further eight magazines and 64 loose rounds, and a haversack containing a further four magazines. Riflemen would be discouraged to fire, as this slowed the advance, their job was to leapfrog while being covered; firing by the platoon and half-platoon was only permitted to cover its own advance or that of a neighbouring platoon, or to deal with enemy pockets on their way.

The principal role of the Chauchat was to provide a mobile barrage during the advance. This required skilled teamwork on the part of the crew, changing the magazines while on the move to keep up the volume of fire. As the center of the tactical device, the Chauchat gunner (&quot;tireur&quot;) would expect casualties - but also decorations:&quot;&quot;Soldat Carpentier, 20e RI, near Nogentel, Oise, 31 August 1918... he advanced on the enemy, firing while walking, the rest of the platoon led by Sergeant Berthault. He succeed in maneuvering around the flank of an island of resistance and in capturing, with his comrades, four machine guns and twenty-five German gunners&quot;.&quot;Carpentier was awarded the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; with palm.

By 1916, French Army tactical methods started emphasizing concentrated firepower and the flexible use of infantry. The experience of Verdun would carry to the Somme, and French units were successful in capturing their objectives at the beginning of the offensive, as well as suffering less casualties.

From October 1917 the platoon had two LMG/rifle-grenadier sections, one hand grenade section and one rifle section. This new system would fight the Battle of La Malmaison, from 23 to 27 October, with the French interarms infantry beating back enemy attacks where the German infantry attacked &quot;en masse&quot;, shoulder to shoulder. At the same battle, General Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey the commander of 6th Army, successfully introduced specially trained squads of infantry whose role was to accompany the tanks (&quot;chars d&#x27;assaut&quot;, as they were called). In a series of instructions in 1918, General Philippe Pétain sought to achieve greater cooperation between air power, artillery and tanks, all acting in support of the assaulting infantry; measures which bore fruit in the counter-offensives of summer 1918.

By mid-1918, the Allies managed to restore some degree of mobility to the war and the end of the stalemate on the Western Front; with less muddy trenches and more open fields. Furthermore, French infantry regiments had been reorganized into multiple small (18 men) combat groups (&quot;Demi-Sections de Combat&quot;). The infantry platoon now had a platoon leader and platoon sergeant, formed in two half-platoons commanded by sergeants. The 1st half-platoon had a Grenadier Squad (Corporal, 2x hand grenadiers, 2x grenade carriers, 2x riflemen) and a LMG Squad (Corporal, 3x rifle grenadiers, 2x ammo carriers, 1x LMG gunner), the 2nd half-platoon had a LMG Squad (Corporal, 3x rifle grenadiers, 2x ammo carriers, 1x LMG gunner) and a Rifle Squad (Corporal, 6x riflemen).

The French regimental records and the statistics of medals given to Chauchat gunners document that they were an essential contribution to the success of these updated infantry tactics. Those were applied to suppress enemy machine gun nests, that would be approached by fire on the move, and destroyed by the combined action of Chauchat automatic fire coming from the sides and VB rifle grenades fired from the front, within less than 200 yards (182.9 meters); in military terms, assault distance. Captured terrain would be defended by emplaced Chauchat fire bases suppressing enemy counter-attacks until heavier machine guns could be brought from the rear.

===WWI German use===
A number of captured Chauchats were used by German front-line infantrymen in flamethrower units and assault troops because they had no equivalent light machine guns of their own until their attempt at one such portable weapon - the Maxim MG 08-15 lightened machine guns - that were issued to them during early 1917. The German army tried to modify some of these guns to fire the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge.

===Belgian use===

The Belgian Army, which held a large sector of the Western Front but left its arms industry on the territories occupied by the Germans, started to acquire Chauchats for its infantry in the spring of 1916, getting over 1400 in a year, all in 8 mm Lebel. In order to simplify squad-level logistics in the spring of 1917 a version chambered in their standard 7.65×53mm Mauser ammunition was tested, which had a new curved box magazine lacking cutouts for the mud to get inside. During the war, Belgium acquired almost 7000 Chauchats, and reportedly about a half of those were either produced in 7.65 or retrofitted to the &quot;modelle 1915-17&quot; standard, with 3250 in active service and an unknown number (taking into account combat losses) in reserve. These numbers, however, are inconsistent with the fact that 4000 of Belgian M1915/17s were sold to Yugoslavia (see below). By 1924, Belgium only had 2902 automatic rifles to declare to the League of Nations, with none in reserve.

The remaining ones were modified to address the numerous deficiencies in the unrefined design, the most visually obvious one was being covers against mud and dust on all the orifices. Less obvious modifications were a better bipod and a latch to tighten upper receiver to the lower. Postwar-upgraded guns were designated &quot;Fusil-Mitrailleur 1915-27&quot;. They were kept in service into the 1930s including some rear-line troops in 1940.

===Serbian use===
The Royal Serbian Army received at least 1,400 Chauchats, locally known as &quot;puškomitraljez M. 1915&quot;, between December 1916 and April 1917. In mid-1920s Yugoslavia bought 4,000 M1915/17s more from Belgium as a stopgap measure, and in 1926-1928 rechambered them from 7,65-mm Belgian to captured 7.9x57 M1888 ammo, designating the result as &quot;puškomitraljez 7,9 mm. M. 15/26&quot;.

===Greek use===

Chauchat entered service with Hellenic Army in 1917. The guns fired the 6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer cartridge, stored in semi-circular magazine. Turkish National Movement forces used captured guns during the Greco-Turkish War. The Chauchat was still in frontline use during the Greco-Italian War.

===Polish use===
Poland received French military assistance, notably infantry weapons and artillery, after World War I. As a part of those French weaponry transfers, Poland received over 2,000 Chauchats, which they used extensively during the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921). After that war, Poland bought more of them, and their numbers reached 11,869, becoming a standard Polish light machine gun (the &quot;RKM wz 15&quot;). Eventually, about half of them were successfully converted during the mid-1920s to 7.92×57mm Mauser (or 8mm Mauser) and kept in service until the early 1930s under the designation &quot;RKM wz 15/27&quot;. One remaining specimen of these Polish Chauchats in 8mm Mauser is preserved and visible in the MoD (Ministry of Defence) National Firearms Centre which is a part of the Royal Armouries in Leeds, Great Britain. Later, in 1936–1937, some 2,650 Chauchats were sold abroad by Poland, some to the Mexican Army, others to Republican Spain and also on the international surplus weapon market.

===Finnish use===
During the Winter War between Soviet Union and Finland, over 5,000 surplus Chauchats were donated by France to Finland, which was short on automatic weapons. The weapons arrived too late to see action but were used in Continuation War, mostly on the home front. After the war they were warehoused until 1955 and sold to Interarmco in 1959–1960.

===WWII use===
Chinese-made copies of the Chauchat were captured by Japanese forces during the Second Sino-Japanese War. French third-line units that faced the German breakthrough during the Fall of France in May and June 1940 were still equipped with Chauchat machine guns.

Nazi Germany seized Chauchats from Poland, Belgium, France, Greece and Yugoslavia. Ex-French guns were designated &quot;LeMG 156(f)&quot;, ex-Yugoslav and ex-Polish &quot;LeMG 147(j)&quot;, ex-Greek &quot;LeMG 156(g)&quot; and ex-Belgian &quot;LeMG 126(b)&quot;. A small number of Chauchats captured by the Germans were issued to the Hungarians.

===Other uses===
The Chauchat saw service by Syria in the 1948 Arab-Israel war.

==Comparison==

Unlike much heavier air- and water-cooled machine guns (such as the Hotchkiss machine gun and the various belt-fed Maxim gun derivatives), and like the Madsen machine gun and Lewis gun, the Chauchat was not designed for sustained defensive fire from fixed positions. The tactical edge expected from the light and portable Chauchat machine rifle was to increase the offensive firepower of advancing infantry during the assaults. This particular tactic became known as marching fire. Colonel Chauchat had already formulated this tactical vision since the early 1900s, in his many proposals to the highest levels of the French military command structure, including General Joffre.

==Users==

*: 6,935 (about half of them converted to 7.65×53mm Mauser)
*: Used captured examples
*: About 100 copies of the Chauchat were produced by Jinglin Arsenal and used during the Second Sino-Japanese War.
*: The Czechoslovak Legion brought back 130 Chauchat guns from Russia in 1920
*: over 100,000 placed in front-line service at the infantry squad level between April 1916 and November 1918.
*: delivered by France from 1917 and 3,950 received from Poland
*: 546 used by the Latvian Army (by April 1936)
*: 1,729
*: 4,495
*: 6,100
* Soviet Russia: several Red Army units used Chauchats during Russian Civil War
*: 3,838
*: at least 100,000, many of them converted to 7.92×57mm Mauser
*: Captured from Republicans or intercepted during transport
*: used during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War
* : Turkish National Movement used captured examples, later used by the Army
* (1917–1918): 15,918 in 8mm Lebel plus 19,241 in US 30-06. The latter model (in US .30-06), being unsatisfactory, was never deployed in significant numbers.

==Replacement==

After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the French military decided to upgrade to a more reliable light squad automatic weapon that would be designed and manufactured nationally. Experimentation was carried out at the Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Châtellerault during the early 1920s, culminating in the adoption of the new light machine gun (in French: &quot;fusil-mitrailleur&quot;), the FM Mle 1924. Gas-operated, and using a new 7.5 mm rimless cartridge (that would evolve into the 7.5x54mm French), this finally corrected all the problems associated with the Chauchat, and was manufactured in large numbers (232,000) and widely used by the French Army until the late 1950s.

<text>Nuclear chemistry is the sub-field of chemistry dealing with radioactivity, nuclear processes, and transformations in the nuclei of atoms, such as nuclear transmutation and nuclear properties.

It is the chemistry of radioactive elements such as the actinides, radium and radon together with the chemistry associated with equipment (such as nuclear reactors) which are designed to perform nuclear processes. This includes the corrosion of surfaces and the behavior under conditions of both normal and abnormal operation (such as during an accident). An important area is the behavior of objects and materials after being placed into a nuclear waste storage or disposal site.

It includes the study of the chemical effects resulting from the absorption of radiation within living animals, plants, and other materials. The radiation chemistry controls much of radiation biology as radiation has an effect on living things at the molecular scale. To explain it another way, the radiation alters the biochemicals within an organism, the alteration of the bio-molecules then changes the chemistry which occurs within the organism; this change in chemistry then can lead to a biological outcome. As a result, nuclear chemistry greatly assists the understanding of medical treatments (such as cancer radiotherapy) and has enabled these treatments to improve.

It includes the study of the production and use of radioactive sources for a range of processes. These include radiotherapy in medical applications; the use of radioactive tracers within industry, science and the environment, and the use of radiation to modify materials such as polymers.

It also includes the study and use of nuclear processes in &quot;non-radioactive&quot; areas of human activity. For instance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used in synthetic organic chemistry and physical chemistry and for structural analysis in macro-molecular chemistry.

==History==
After Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays in 1895, many scientists began to work on ionizing radiation. One of these was Henri Becquerel, who investigated the relationship between phosphorescence and the blackening of photographic plates. When Becquerel (working in France) discovered that, with no external source of energy, the uranium generated rays which could blacken (or &quot;fog&quot;) the photographic plate, radioactivity was discovered. Marie Skłodowska-Curie (working in Paris) and her husband Pierre Curie isolated two new radioactive elements from uranium ore. They used radiometric methods to identify which stream the radioactivity was in after each chemical separation; they separated the uranium ore into each of the different chemical elements that were known at the time, and measured the radioactivity of each fraction. They then attempted to separate these radioactive fractions further, to isolate a smaller fraction with a higher specific activity (radioactivity divided by mass). In this way, they isolated polonium and radium. It was noticed in about 1901 that high doses of radiation could cause an injury in humans. Henri Becquerel had carried a sample of radium in his pocket and as a result he suffered a highly localized dose which resulted in a radiation burn. This injury resulted in the biological properties of radiation being investigated, which in time resulted in the development of medical treatment.
Ernest Rutherford, working in Canada and England, showed that radioactive decay can be described by a simple equation (a linear first degree derivative equation, now called first order kinetics), implying that a given radioactive substance has a characteristic &quot;half-life&quot; (the time taken for the amount of radioactivity present in a source to diminish by half). He also coined the terms alpha, beta and gamma rays, he converted nitrogen into oxygen, and most importantly he supervised the students who conducted the Geiger–Marsden experiment (gold foil experiment) which showed that the &#x27;plum pudding model&#x27; of the atom was wrong. In the plum pudding model, proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1904, the atom is composed of electrons surrounded by a &#x27;cloud&#x27; of positive charge to balance the electrons&#x27; negative charge. To Rutherford, the gold foil experiment implied that the positive charge was confined to a very small nucleus leading first to the Rutherford model, and eventually to the Bohr model of the atom, where the positive nucleus is surrounded by the negative electrons.

In 1934, Marie Curie&#x27;s daughter (Irène Joliot-Curie) and son-in-law (Frédéric Joliot-Curie) were the first to create artificial radioactivity: they bombarded boron with alpha particles to make the neutron-poor isotope nitrogen-13; this isotope emitted positrons. In addition, they bombarded aluminium and magnesium with neutrons to make new radioisotopes.

In the early 1920s Otto Hahn created a new line of research. Using the &quot;emanation method&quot;, which he had recently developed, and the &quot;emanation ability&quot;, he founded what became known as &quot;applied radiochemistry&quot; for the researching of general chemical and physical-chemical questions. In 1936 Cornell University Press published a book in English (and later in Russian) titled &quot;Applied Radiochemistry&quot;, which contained the lectures given by Hahn when he was a visiting professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1933. This important publication had a major influence on almost all nuclear chemists and physicists in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union during the 1930s and 1940s, laying the foundation for modern nuclear chemistry.
Hahn and Lise Meitner discovered radioactive isotopes of radium, thorium, protactinium and uranium. He also discovered the phenomena of radioactive recoil and nuclear isomerism, and pioneered rubidium–strontium dating. In 1938, Hahn, Lise Meitner and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission, for which Hahn received the 1944 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Nuclear fission was the basis for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Hahn is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry and godfather of nuclear fission.

==Main areas==
Radiochemistry is the chemistry of radioactive materials, in which radioactive isotopes of elements are used to study the properties and chemical reactions of non-radioactive isotopes (often within radiochemistry the absence of radioactivity leads to a substance being described as being &quot;inactive&quot; as the isotopes are &quot;stable&quot;).

For further details please see the page on radiochemistry.

===Radiation chemistry===
Radiation chemistry is the study of the chemical effects of radiation on matter; this is very different from radiochemistry as no radioactivity needs to be present in the material which is being chemically changed by the radiation. An example is the conversion of water into hydrogen gas and hydrogen peroxide. Prior to radiation chemistry, it was commonly believed that pure water could not be destroyed.

Initial experiments were focused on understanding the effects of radiation on matter. Using a X-ray generator, Hugo Fricke studied the biological effects of radiation as it became a common treatment option and diagnostic method. Fricke proposed and subsequently proved that the energy from X - rays were able to convert water into activated water, allowing it to react with dissolved species.

===Chemistry for nuclear power===
Radiochemistry, radiation chemistry and nuclear chemical engineering play a very important role for uranium and thorium fuel precursors synthesis, starting from ores of these elements, fuel fabrication, coolant chemistry, fuel reprocessing, radioactive waste treatment and storage, monitoring of radioactive elements release during reactor operation and radioactive geological storage, etc.

===Study of nuclear reactions===
A combination of radiochemistry and radiation chemistry is used to study nuclear reactions such as fission and fusion. Some early evidence for nuclear fission was the formation of a short-lived radioisotope of barium which was isolated from neutron irradiated uranium (139Ba, with a half-life of 83 minutes and 140Ba, with a half-life of 12.8 days, are major fission products of uranium). At the time, it was thought that this was a new radium isotope, as it was then standard radiochemical practice to use a barium sulfate carrier precipitate to assist in the isolation of radium. More recently, a combination of radiochemical methods and nuclear physics has been used to try to make new &#x27;superheavy&#x27; elements; it is thought that islands of relative stability exist where the nuclides have half-lives of years, thus enabling weighable amounts of the new elements to be isolated. For more details of the original discovery of nuclear fission see the work of Otto Hahn.

=== The nuclear fuel cycle ===

This is the chemistry associated with any part of the nuclear fuel cycle, including nuclear reprocessing. The fuel cycle includes all the operations involved in producing fuel, from mining, ore processing and enrichment to fuel production (&quot;Front-end of the cycle&quot;). It also includes the &#x27;in-pile&#x27; behavior (use of the fuel in a reactor) before the &quot;back end&quot; of the cycle. The &quot;back end&quot; includes the management of the used nuclear fuel in either a spent fuel pool or dry storage, before it is disposed of into an underground waste store or reprocessed.

==== Normal and abnormal conditions ====

The nuclear chemistry associated with the nuclear fuel cycle can be divided into two main areas, one area is concerned with operation under the intended conditions while the other area is concerned with maloperation conditions where some alteration from the normal operating conditions has occurred or (&quot;more rarely&quot;) an accident is occurring. Without this process, none of this would be true.

====Reprocessing====

=====Law=====
In the United States, it is normal to use fuel once in a power reactor before placing it in a waste store. The long-term plan is currently to place the used civilian reactor fuel in a deep store. This non-reprocessing policy was started in March 1977 because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. President Jimmy Carter issued a Presidential directive which indefinitely suspended the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the United States. This directive was likely an attempt by the United States to lead other countries by example, but many other nations continue to reprocess spent nuclear fuels. The Russian government under President Vladimir Putin repealed a law which had banned the import of used nuclear fuel, which makes it possible for Russians to offer a reprocessing service for clients outside Russia (similar to that offered by BNFL).

=====PUREX chemistry=====
The current method of choice is to use the PUREX liquid-liquid extraction process which uses a tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon mixture to extract both uranium and plutonium from nitric acid. This extraction is of the nitrate salts and is classed as being of a solvation mechanism. For example, the extraction of plutonium by an extraction agent (S) in a nitrate medium occurs by the following reaction.

:Pu4+aq + 4NO3−aq + 2Sorganic → [Pu(NO3)4S2]organic

A complex bond is formed between the metal cation, the nitrates and the tributyl phosphate, and a model compound of a dioxouranium(VI) complex with two nitrate anions and two triethyl phosphate ligands has been characterised by X-ray crystallography.

When the nitric acid concentration is high the extraction into the organic phase is favored, and when the nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the organic phase is &quot;stripped&quot; of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after the removal of the insoluble matter the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded organic phase to create a &quot;medium active&quot; liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This medium active aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new organic phase, the metal bearing organic phase is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium. The two stages of extraction are used to improve the purity of the actinide product, the organic phase used for the first extraction will suffer a far greater dose of radiation. The radiation can degrade the tributyl phosphate into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can act as an extraction agent for both the actinides and other metals such as ruthenium. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can make the system behave in a more complex manner as it tends to extract metals by an ion exchange mechanism (extraction favoured by low acid concentration), to reduce the effect of the dibutyl hydrogen phosphate it is common for the used organic phase to be washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove the acidic degradation products of the tributyl phosphatioloporus.

=====New methods being considered for future use=====

The PUREX process can be modified to make a UREX (&quot;UR&quot;anium &quot;EX&quot;traction) process which could be used to save space inside high level nuclear waste disposal sites, such as Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, by removing the uranium which makes up the vast majority of the mass and volume of used fuel and recycling it as reprocessed uranium.

The UREX process is a PUREX process which has been modified to prevent the plutonium being extracted. This can be done by adding a plutonium reductant before the first metal extraction step. In the UREX process, ~99.9% of the uranium and &gt;95% of technetium are separated from each other and the other fission products and actinides. The key is the addition of acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) to the extraction and scrubs sections of the process. The addition of AHA greatly diminishes the extractability of plutonium and neptunium, providing greater proliferation resistance than with the plutonium extraction stage of the PUREX process.

Adding a second extraction agent, octyl(phenyl)-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dibutyl carbamoylmethyl phosphine oxide (CMPO) in combination with tributylphosphate, (TBP), the PUREX process can be turned into the TRUEX (&quot;TR&quot;ans&quot;U&quot;ranic &quot;EX&quot;traction) process this is a process which was invented in the US by Argonne National Laboratory, and is designed to remove the transuranic metals (Am/Cm) from waste. The idea is that by lowering the alpha activity of the waste, the majority of the waste can then be disposed of with greater ease. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.

As an alternative to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (&quot;DIAM&quot;ide&quot;EX&quot;traction) process has the advantage of avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain. The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.

Selective Actinide Extraction (SANEX). As part of the management of minor actinides, it has been proposed that the lanthanides and trivalent minor actinides should be removed from the PUREX raffinate by a process such as DIAMEX or TRUEX. In order to allow the actinides such as americium to be either reused in industrial sources or used as fuel the lanthanides must be removed. The lanthanides have large neutron cross sections and hence they would poison a neutron-driven nuclear reaction. To date, the extraction system for the SANEX process has not been defined, but currently, several different research groups are working towards a process. For instance, the French CEA is working on a bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) based process.

Other systems such as the dithiophosphinic acids are being worked on by some other workers.

This is the &quot;UNiversal&quot; &quot;EX&quot;traction process which was developed in Russia and the Czech Republic, it is a process designed to remove all of the most troublesome (Sr, Cs and minor actinides) radioisotopes from the raffinates left after the extraction of uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. The chemistry is based upon the interaction of caesium and strontium with poly ethylene oxide (poly ethylene glycol) and a cobalt carborane anion (known as chlorinated cobalt dicarbollide). The actinides are extracted by CMPO, and the diluent is a polar aromatic such as nitrobenzene. Other diluents such as &quot;meta&quot;-nitrobenzotrifluoride and phenyl trifluoromethyl sulfone have been suggested as well.

====Absorption of fission products on surfaces====
Another important area of nuclear chemistry is the study of how fission products interact with surfaces; this is thought to control the rate of release and migration of fission products both from waste containers under normal conditions and from power reactors under accident conditions. Like chromate and molybdate, the 99TcO4 anion can react with steel surfaces to form a corrosion resistant layer. In this way, these metaloxo anions act as anodic corrosion inhibitors. The formation of 99TcO2 on steel surfaces is one effect which will retard the release of 99Tc from nuclear waste drums and nuclear equipment which has been lost before decontamination (e.g. submarine reactors lost at sea). This 99TcO2 layer renders the steel surface passive, inhibiting the anodic corrosion reaction. The radioactive nature of technetium makes this corrosion protection impractical in almost all situations. It has also been shown that 99TcO4 anions react to form a layer on the surface of activated carbon (charcoal) or aluminium. A short review of the biochemical properties of a series of key long lived radioisotopes can be read on line.

99Tc in nuclear waste may exist in chemical forms other than the 99TcO4 anion, these other forms have different chemical properties.
Similarly, the release of iodine-131 in a serious power reactor accident could be retarded by absorption on metal surfaces within the nuclear plant.

== Education ==
Despite the growing use of nuclear medicine, the potential expansion of nuclear power plants, and worries about protection against nuclear threats and the management of the nuclear waste generated in past decades, the number of students opting to specialize in nuclear and radiochemistry has decreased significantly over the past few decades. Now, with many experts in these fields approaching retirement age, action is needed to avoid a workforce gap in these critical fields, for example by building student interest in these careers, expanding the educational capacity of universities and colleges, and providing more specific on-the-job training.

Nuclear and Radiochemistry (NRC) is mostly being taught at university level, usually first at the Master- and PhD-degree level. In Europe, as substantial effort is being done to harmonize and prepare the NRC education for the industry&#x27;s and society&#x27;s future needs. This effort is being coordinated in a project funded by the Coordinated Action supported by the European Atomic Energy Community&#x27;s 7th Framework Program. Although NucWik is primarily aimed at teachers, anyone interested in nuclear and radiochemistry is welcome and can find a lot of information and material explaining topics related to NRC.

==Spinout areas==
Some methods first developed within nuclear chemistry and physics have become so widely used within chemistry and other physical sciences that they may be best thought of as separate from &quot;normal&quot; nuclear chemistry. For example, the isotope effect is used so extensively to investigate chemical mechanisms and the use of cosmogenic isotopes and long-lived unstable isotopes in geology that it is best to consider much of isotopic chemistry as separate from nuclear chemistry.

=== Kinetics (use within mechanistic chemistry) ===

The mechanisms of chemical reactions can be investigated by observing how the kinetics of a reaction is changed by making an isotopic modification of a substrate, known as the kinetic isotope effect. This is now a standard method in organic chemistry. Briefly, replacing normal hydrogen (protons) by deuterium within a molecule causes the molecular vibrational frequency of X-H (for example C-H, N-H and O-H) bonds to decrease, which leads to a decrease in vibrational zero-point energy. This can lead to a decrease in the reaction rate if the rate-determining step involves breaking a bond between hydrogen and another atom. Thus, if the reaction changes in rate when protons are replaced by deuteriums, it is reasonable to assume that the breaking of the bond to hydrogen is part of the step which determines the rate.

=== Uses within geology, biology and forensic science ===

Cosmogenic isotopes are formed by the interaction of cosmic rays with the nucleus of an atom. These can be used for dating purposes and for use as natural tracers. In addition, by careful measurement of some ratios of stable isotopes it is possible to obtain new insights into the origin of bullets, ages of ice samples, ages of rocks, and the diet of a person can be identified from a hair or other tissue sample. (See Isotope geochemistry and Isotopic signature for further details).

==== Biology ====

Within living things, isotopic labels (both radioactive and nonradioactive) can be used to probe how the complex web of reactions which makes up the metabolism of an organism converts one substance to another. For instance a green plant uses light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose by photosynthesis. If the oxygen in the water is labeled, then the label appears in the oxygen gas formed by the plant and not in the glucose formed in the chloroplasts within the plant cells.

For biochemical and physiological experiments and medical methods, a number of specific isotopes have important applications.

*Stable isotopes have the advantage of not delivering a radiation dose to the system being studied; however, a significant excess of them in the organ or organism might still interfere with its functionality, and the availability of sufficient amounts for whole-animal studies is limited for many isotopes. Measurement is also difficult, and usually requires mass spectrometry to determine how much of the isotope is present in particular compounds, and there is no means of localizing measurements within the cell.
*2H (deuterium), the stable isotope of hydrogen, is a stable tracer, the concentration of which can be measured by mass spectrometry or NMR. It is incorporated into all cellular structures. Specific deuterated compounds can also be produced.
*15N, a stable isotope of nitrogen, has also been used. It is incorporated mainly into proteins.
*Radioactive isotopes have the advantages of being detectable in very low quantities, in being easily measured by scintillation counting or other radiochemical methods, and in being localizable to particular regions of a cell, and quantifiable by autoradiography. Many compounds with the radioactive atoms in specific positions can be prepared, and are widely available commercially. In high quantities they require precautions to guard the workers from the effects of radiation—and they can easily contaminate laboratory glassware and other equipment. For some isotopes the half-life is so short that preparation and measurement is difficult.

By organic synthesis it is possible to create a complex molecule with a radioactive label that can be confined to a small area of the molecule. For short-lived isotopes such as 11C, very rapid synthetic methods have been developed to permit the rapid addition of the radioactive isotope to the molecule. For instance a palladium catalysed carbonylation reaction in a microfluidic device has been used to rapidly form amides and it might be possible to use this method to form radioactive imaging agents for PET imaging.

*3H (tritium), the radioisotope of hydrogen, is available at very high specific activities, and compounds with this isotope in particular positions are easily prepared by standard chemical reactions such as hydrogenation of unsaturated precursors. The isotope emits very soft beta radiation, and can be detected by scintillation counting.
*11C, carbon-11 is usually produced by cyclotron bombardment of 14N with protons. The resulting nuclear reaction is . Additionally, carbon-11 can also be made using a cyclotron; boron in the form of boric oxide is reacted with protons in a (p,n) reaction. Another alternative route is to react 10B with deuterons. By rapid organic synthesis, the 11C compound formed in the cyclotron is converted into the imaging agent which is then used for PET.
*14C, carbon-14 can be made (as above), and it is possible to convert the target material into simple inorganic and organic compounds. In most organic synthesis work it is normal to try to create a product out of two approximately equal sized fragments and to use a convergent route, but when a radioactive label is added, it is normal to try to add the label late in the synthesis in the form of a very small fragment to the molecule to enable the radioactivity to be localised in a single group. Late addition of the label also reduces the number of synthetic stages where radioactive material is used.
*18F, fluorine-18 can be made by the reaction of neon with deuterons, 20Ne reacts in a (d,4He) reaction. It is normal to use neon gas with a trace of stable fluorine (19F2). The 19F2 acts as a carrier which increases the yield of radioactivity from the cyclotron target by reducing the amount of radioactivity lost by absorption on surfaces. However, this reduction in loss is at the cost of the specific activity of the final product.

=== Nuclear spectroscopy ===
Nuclear spectroscopy are methods that use the nucleus to obtain information of the local structure in matter. Important methods are NMR (see below), Mössbauer spectroscopy and Perturbed angular correlation. These methods use the interaction of the hyperfine field with the nucleus&#x27; spin. The field can be magnetic or/and electric and are created by the electrons of the atom and its surrounding neighbours. Thus, these methods investigate the local structure in matter, mainly condensed matter in condensed matter physics and solid state chemistry.

==== Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) ====
NMR spectroscopy uses the net spin of nuclei in a substance upon energy absorption to identify molecules. This has now become a standard spectroscopic tool within synthetic chemistry. One major use of NMR is to determine the bond connectivity within an organic molecule.

NMR imaging also uses the net spin of nuclei (commonly protons) for imaging. This is widely used for diagnostic purposes in medicine, and can provide detailed images of the inside of a person without inflicting any radiation upon them. In a medical setting, NMR is often known simply as &quot;magnetic resonance&quot; imaging, as the word &#x27;nuclear&#x27; has negative connotations for many people.

<doc id="242006" wikidata="Q3394849" url="?curid=242006" title="Reaction rate">
<text>The reaction rate or rate of reaction is the speed at which a chemical reaction takes place, defined as proportional to the increase in the concentration of a product per unit time and to the decrease in the concentration of a reactant per unit time. Reaction rates can vary dramatically. For example, the oxidative rusting of iron under Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is a slow reaction that can take many years, but the combustion of cellulose in a fire is a reaction that takes place in fractions of a second. For most reactions, the rate decreases as the reaction proceeds. A reaction&#x27;s rate can be determined by measuring the changes in concentration over time.

Chemical kinetics is the part of physical chemistry that concerns how rates of chemical reactions are measured and predicted, and how reaction-rate data can be used to deduce probable reaction mechanisms. The concepts of chemical kinetics are applied in many disciplines, such as chemical engineering, enzymology and environmental engineering.

==Formal definition==
Consider a typical balanced chemical reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;{\mathit{a}A} + {\mathit{b}B} -&gt; {\mathit{p}P} + {\mathit{q}Q}&lt;/chem&gt;

The lowercase letters (, , , and ) represent stoichiometric coefficients, while the capital letters represent the reactants ( and ) and the products ( and ).

According to IUPAC&#x27;s Gold Book definition
the reaction rate formula_1 for a chemical reaction occurring in a closed system at constant volume, without a build-up of reaction intermediates, is defined as:

formula_2

where denotes the concentration of the substance or . The reaction rate thus defined has the units of mol/L/s.

The rate of a reaction is always positive. A negative sign is present to indicate that the reactant concentration is decreasing. The IUPAC recommends that the unit of time should always be the second. The rate of reaction differs from the rate of increase of concentration of a product P by a constant factor (the reciprocal of its stoichiometric number) and for a reactant A by minus the reciprocal of the stoichiometric number. The stoichiometric numbers are included so that the defined rate is independent of which reactant or product species is chosen for measurement. For example, if and then is consumed three times more rapidly than , but formula_3 is uniquely defined. An additional advantage of this definition is that for an elementary and irreversible reaction, formula_1 is equal to the product of the probability of overcoming the transition state activation energy and the number of times per second the transition state is approached by reactant molecules. When so defined, for an elementary and irreversible reaction, formula_1 is the rate of successful chemical reaction events leading to the product.

The above definition is only valid for a &quot;single reaction&quot;, in a &quot;closed system&quot; of &quot;constant volume&quot;. If water is added to a pot containing salty water, the concentration of salt decreases, although there is no chemical reaction.

For an open system, the full mass balance must be taken into account:

formula_6
where 
* is the inflow rate of in molecules per second;
* the outflow;
*formula_1 is the instantaneous reaction rate of (in number concentration rather than molar) in a given differential volume, integrated over the entire system volume at a given moment. 
When applied to the closed system at constant volume considered previously, this equation reduces to:
formula_8,
where the concentration is related to the number of molecules by formula_9 Here is the Avogadro constant.

For a single reaction in a closed system of varying volume the so-called &quot;rate of conversion&quot; can be used, in order to avoid handling concentrations. It is defined as the derivative of the extent of reaction with respect to time.

formula_10

Here is the stoichiometric coefficient for substance , equal to , , , and in the typical reaction above. Also is the volume of reaction and is the concentration of substance .

When side products or reaction intermediates are formed, the IUPAC recommends the use of the terms the rate of increase of concentration and rate of the decrease of concentration for products and reactants, properly.

Reaction rates may also be defined on a basis that is not the volume of the reactor. When a catalyst is used the reaction rate may be stated on a catalyst weight (mol g−1 s−1) or surface area (mol m−2 s−1) basis. If the basis is a specific catalyst site that may be rigorously counted by a specified method, the rate is given in units of s−1 and is called a turnover frequency.

==Influencing factors==
Factors that influence the reaction rate are the nature of the reaction, concentration, pressure, reaction order, temperature, solvent, electromagnetic radiation, catalyst, isotopes, surface area, stirring, and diffusion limit. Some reactions are naturally faster than others. The number of reacting species, their physical state (the particles that form solids move much more slowly than those of gases or those in solution), the complexity of the reaction and other factors can greatly influence the rate of a reaction.

Reaction rate increases with concentration, as described by the rate law and explained by collision theory. As reactant concentration increases, the frequency of collision increases. The rate of gaseous reactions increases with pressure, which is, in fact, equivalent to an increase in the concentration of the gas. The reaction rate increases in the direction where there are fewer moles of gas and decreases in the reverse direction. For condensed-phase reactions, the pressure dependence is weak.

The order of the reaction controls how the reactant concentration (or pressure) affects the reaction rate.

Usually conducting a reaction at a higher temperature delivers more energy into the system and increases the reaction rate by causing more collisions between particles, as explained by collision theory. However, the main reason that temperature increases the rate of reaction is that more of the colliding particles will have the necessary activation energy resulting in more successful collisions (when bonds are formed between reactants). The influence of temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation. For example, coal burns in a fireplace in the presence of oxygen, but it does not when it is stored at room temperature. The reaction is spontaneous at low and high temperatures but at room temperature, its rate is so slow that it is negligible. The increase in temperature, as created by a match, allows the reaction to start and then it heats itself because it is exothermic. That is valid for many other fuels, such as methane, butane, and hydrogen.

Reaction rates can be independent of temperature (&quot;non-Arrhenius&quot;) or decrease with increasing temperature (&quot;anti-Arrhenius&quot;). Reactions without an activation barrier (for example, some radical reactions), tend to have anti-Arrhenius temperature dependence: the rate constant decreases with increasing temperature.

Many reactions take place in solution and the properties of the solvent affect the reaction rate. The ionic strength also has an effect on the reaction rate.

Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy. As such, it may speed up the rate or even make a reaction spontaneous as it provides the particles of the reactants with more energy. This energy is in one way or another stored in the reacting particles (it may break bonds, and promote molecules to electronically or vibrationally excited states...) creating intermediate species that react easily. As the intensity of light increases, the particles absorb more energy and hence the rate of reaction increases. For example, when methane reacts with chlorine in the dark, the reaction rate is slow. It can be sped up when the mixture is put under diffused light. In bright sunlight, the reaction is explosive.

The presence of a catalyst increases the reaction rate (in both the forward and reverse reactions) by providing an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy. For example, platinum catalyzes the combustion of hydrogen with oxygen at room temperature.

The kinetic isotope effect consists of a different reaction rate for the same molecule if it has different isotopes, usually hydrogen isotopes, because of the relative mass difference between hydrogen and deuterium.
In reactions on surfaces, which take place, for example, during heterogeneous catalysis, the rate of reaction increases as the surface area does. That is because more particles of the solid are exposed and can be hit by reactant molecules.

Stirring can have a strong effect on the rate of reaction for heterogeneous reactions.

Some reactions are limited by diffusion. All the factors that affect a reaction rate, except for concentration and reaction order, are taken into account in the reaction rate coefficient (the coefficient in the rate equation of the reaction).

==Rate equation==

For a chemical reaction , the rate equation or rate law is a mathematical expression used in chemical kinetics to link the rate of a reaction to the concentration of each reactant. For a closed system at constant volume, this is often of the form 
formula_11

For reactions that go to completion (which implies very small ), or if only the initial rate is analyzed (with initial vanishing product concentrations), this simplifies to the commonly quoted form

formula_12

For gas phase reaction the rate equation is often alternatively expressed in terms of partial pressures.

In these equations is the &quot;reaction rate coefficient&quot; or &quot;rate constant&quot;, although it is not really a constant, because it includes all the parameters that affect reaction rate, except for time and concentration. Of all the parameters influencing reaction rates, temperature is normally the most important one and is accounted for by the Arrhenius equation.

The exponents and are called reaction orders and depend on the reaction mechanism. For an elementary (single-step) reaction, the order with respect to each reactant is equal to its stoichiometric coefficient. For complex (multistep) reactions, however, this is often not true and the rate equation is determined by the detailed mechanism, as illustrated below for the reaction of H2 and NO.

For elementary reactions or reaction steps, the order and stoichiometric coefficient are both equal to the molecularity or number of molecules participating. For a unimolecular reaction or step, the rate is proportional to the concentration of molecules of reactant, so the rate law is first order. For a bimolecular reaction or step, the number of collisions is proportional to the product of the two reactant concentrations, or second order. A termolecular step is predicted to be third order, but also very slow as simultaneous collisions of three molecules are rare.

By using the mass balance for the system in which the reaction occurs, an expression for the rate of change in concentration can be derived. For a closed system with constant volume, such an expression can look like

formula_13

===Example of a complex reaction: hydrogen and nitric oxide===
For the reaction

formula_14

the observed rate equation (or rate expression) is
formula_15

As for many reactions, the experimental rate equation does not simply reflect the stoichiometric coefficients in the overall reaction: It is third order overall: first order in H2 and second order in NO, even though the stoichiometric coefficients of both reactants are equal to 2.

In chemical kinetics, the overall reaction rate is often explained using a mechanism consisting of a number of elementary steps. Not all of these steps affect the rate of reaction; normally the slowest elementary step controls the reaction rate. For this example, a possible mechanism is

formula_16

Reactions 1 and 3 are very rapid compared to the second, so the slow reaction 2 is the rate-determining step. This is a bimolecular elementary reaction whose rate is given by the second-order equation
formula_17
where is the rate constant for the second step.

However N2O2 is an unstable intermediate whose concentration is determined by the fact that the first step is in equilibrium, so that formula_18 where is the equilibrium constant of the first step. Substitution of this equation in the previous equation leads to a rate equation expressed in terms of the original reactants
formula_19

This agrees with the form of the observed rate equation if it is assumed that . In practice the rate equation is used to suggest possible mechanisms which predict a rate equation in agreement with experiment.

The second molecule of H2 does not appear in the rate equation because it reacts in the third step, which is a rapid step &quot;after&quot; the rate-determining step, so that it does not affect the overall reaction rate.

==Temperature dependence==

Each reaction rate coefficient has a temperature dependency, which is usually given by the Arrhenius equation:

formula_20

where 
*, is the pre-exponential factor or frequency factor,
* is the exponential function,
* is the activation energy, 
* is the gas constant.
Since at temperature the molecules have energies given by a Boltzmann distribution, one can expect the number of collisions with energy greater than to be proportional to formula_21.

The values for and are dependent on the reaction. There are also more complex equations possible, which describe the temperature dependence of other rate constants that do not follow this pattern.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the reactants. As temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the reactants increases. That is, the particles move faster. With the reactants moving faster this allows more collisions to take place at a greater speed, so the chance of reactants forming into products increases, which in turn results in the rate of reaction increasing. A rise of ten degrees Celsius results in approximately twice the reaction rate.
The minimum kinetic energy required for a reaction to occur is called the activation energy and is denoted by or . The transition state or activated complex shown on the diagram is the energy barrier that must be overcome when changing reactants into products. The molecules with an energy greater than this barrier have enough energy to react.

For a successful collision to take place, the collision geometry must be right, meaning the reactant molecules must face the right way so the activated complex can be formed.

A chemical reaction takes place only when the reacting particles collide. However, not all collisions are effective in causing the reaction. Products are formed only when the colliding particles possess a certain minimum energy called threshold energy. As a rule of thumb, reaction rates for many reactions double for every ten degrees Celsius increase in temperature. For a given reaction, the ratio of its rate constant at a higher temperature to its rate constant at a lower temperature is known as its temperature coefficient, (). &quot;Q&quot;10 is commonly used as the ratio of rate constants that are ten degrees Celsius apart.

==Pressure dependence==
The pressure dependence of the rate constant for condensed-phase reactions (that is, when reactants and products are solids or liquid) is usually sufficiently weak in the range of pressures normally encountered in industry that it is neglected in practice.

The pressure dependence of the rate constant is associated with the activation volume. For the reaction proceeding through an activation-state complex:

formula_22

the activation volume, , is:

formula_23

where denotes the partial molar volume of a species and (a double dagger) indicates the activation-state complex.

For the above reaction, one can expect the change of the reaction rate constant (based either on mole fraction or on molar concentration) with pressure at constant temperature to be:

:formula_24

In practice, the matter can be complicated because the partial molar volumes and the activation volume can themselves be a function of pressure.

Reactions can increase or decrease their rates with pressure, depending on the value of . As an example of the possible magnitude of the pressure effect, some organic reactions were shown to double the reaction rate when the pressure was increased from atmospheric (0.1 MPa) to 50 MPa (which gives  −0.025 L/mol).

<text>Fort McCoy is an unincorporated community in Marion County, Florida, United States. It is situated northeast of Ocala and lies between the towns of Sparr and Eureka on County Road 316 and is directly north of Silver Springs on County Road 315. The community is part of the Ocala Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Fort McCoy is located at . The community is located west of the Ocala National Forest.

==History==
Fort McCoy was originally named Fort Mackay. MacKay and MacCoy were both settlers in the area who were killed by Indians during the war. The town of Fort McCoy is named after the settler Jeb MacCoy but spelled differently. When hostilities with Native Americans worsened, Jeb MacCoy was killed by Indians while bringing his family into Fort Russell. Captain Mackay was head of the local militia, and was killed while surveying Itonia Scrub on March 20, 1839.

==Education==
The first school in Fort McCoy was supposedly a log cabin that was built near the fort; and it is thought to have been abandoned during the Second Seminole War. When the Union Church was built near the Fort McCoy Cemetery, it was used as the school, with church services on the weekends. Sometime between the 1890s and the first decade of the 1900s, a wooden building was built to serve as the school. In 1935, this building was destroyed in a fire. A small new school (to serve the approximate 75 pupils at the time) was built on the land donated by Dr Percy F. Lisk, which was right in front of the old schools location. The new brick school opened in 1936. The earliest known student grade levels are from the 1940s, when the school was known as Fort McCoy High School.

Fort McCoy High School was closed in 1963 and re-opened soon after as Fort McCoy Elementary School. The population of Fort McCoy increased over the years, and by the 1980s the property was a vast land full of &quot;portable classrooms&quot;. Due to the population increase and age of the building (50 years old), the Marion County School Board decided to have a new school built in 1986. The original brick building became the Fort McCoy Public Library in 1996, after a $60,000 renovation. In 1988, the new campus opened, renamed as Fort McCoy School, which now served elementary and middle school students (Pre-K to Eighth grade). That campus is still being used today, as well as the same grade levels being served.

Most kids from kindergarten through eighth grade attend Fort McCoy School. Most high school students in Fort McCoy attend North Marion High School, while some attend Lake Weir High School.

<text>The Simple Things is an animated short film, part of the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series, produced by Walt Disney Productions. Released by RKO Radio Pictures on March 27, 1953, the short is notable as the 126th and final regular entry in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; theatrical cartoon series.

Following this short, one-shot Mickey shorts were produced: the featurettes &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990), and the shorts &quot;Runaway Brain&quot; (1995), and &quot;Get a Horse!&quot; (2013).

==Plot==
At the start of the cartoon, Mickey is seen whistling to the tune of the song &quot;The Simple Things&quot; while walking along a rocky seashore, fishing gear in hand. Pluto, sniffing behind him, spots a mussel as he tries to cover up miniature geysers along the way. The mussel then squirts water at him. Pluto barks at the mussel and the mussel barks back. The mussel gets trapped on Pluto&#x27;s tail after they fight. He pulls the mussel up and attempts to shove it off his tail but instead, he pulls the mussel up and down like a yo-yo. The mussel accidentally gets stuck in his mouth.

Pluto then rushes to Mickey for assistance. At first, Mickey thinks that Pluto is asking for food and feeds him a hot dog. The mussel then steals Mickey&#x27;s sandwich and a full pepper shaker which causes the mussel to sneeze thus freeing itself from Pluto&#x27;s mouth. The mussel bounces around sneezing and wakes up a seagull that decides to eat the mussel. The sneezing mussel escapes the seagull by entering the sea. The hungry seagull steals the hot dog that Mickey is feeding Pluto instead.

The seagull then sets his sights on the fish bait Mickey is using and unsuccessfully attempts to steal the fish while the line is being cast. Dejected but determined, the seagull then sits on top of Mickey&#x27;s hat and easily steals the fish as he is baiting the hook until Mickey shoos the seagull away. He then floats under the hat to the other bait bucket and again eats the fish until Pluto notices and shoos him away and the seagull by tying up Pluto using his own tail and ears.

Mickey again catches the seagull in his bait and after the bird tries to fly away carrying the bait, Mickey throws a rock in it which weighs it down. To overcome this, the seagull spells out &quot;FREE FRESH FISH&quot; using flag semaphore to get the other seagulls to chase Mickey and Pluto away. The short ends with the seagull floating away with his portable radio and fish in his mouth singing the song &quot;The Simple Things&quot;.

==Other appearances==
The cartoon was featured in the video game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse&quot;.

==Voice cast==
* Mickey Mouse: Jimmy MacDonald
* Pluto: Pinto Colvig

==Reception==
In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Movies: The Theatrical Films of Mickey Mouse&quot;, Gijs Grob writes: &quot;It would have been nice if Mickey went out with a bang, but &quot;The Simple Things&quot; is anything but that. It&#x27;s a quiet, unassuming film, in which we find Mickey at his most relaxed... Both storylines are executed routinely, and the whole comedy feels tired and uninspired.&quot;

==Home media==
The short was released on May 18, 2004, on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Living Color, Volume Two: 1939-Today&quot;.

<doc id="242023" wikidata="Q2392702" url="?curid=242023" title="Humphrey the Bear">
<text>Humphrey the Bear is a cartoon character created in 1950 at Walt Disney Animation Studios. He first appeared in the 1950 Goofy cartoon &quot;Hold That Pose&quot;, in which Goofy tried to take his picture. After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons: &quot;Rugged Bear&quot; (1953), &quot;Grin and Bear It&quot; (1954), &quot;Bearly Asleep&quot; (1955), and &quot;Beezy Bear&quot; (1955).

Disney gave him his own series in 1955, but only two films resulted (&quot;Hooked Bear&quot; and &quot;In the Bag&quot;, both 1956) before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects. When the shorts division closed, Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own, starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo (the six others were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, and Figaro).

The Humphrey cartoons feature a broader, wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags; critic Leonard Maltin described them as &quot;belly-laugh comedies that can hold their own against the best of MGM and Warner Brothers&quot;.

==Development==
The bear that would become Humphrey first appeared in the 1950 Goofy cartoon &quot;Hold That Pose!&quot; Three years later, Donald Duck series animator Jack Hannah revived the ursine character:

==Personality==
Humphrey is a big, opportunistic, neurotic and dimwitted brown bear who lives in Brownstone National Park. He is constantly trying different ways to steal food and/or shelter from unsuspecting visitors, often violating the park rules in the process. However, his habit of fulfilling his wants/needs in this manner is not entirely unjustified, as it is often shown that he is seldom rewarded when he follows the rules. Unlike most Disney characters, Humphrey does not speak, but instead makes an assortment of inarticulate sounds to convey his emotions; those grunts were supplied by Disney staffer Jimmy MacDonald. When stricken by worry or panic, Humphrey runs desperately in place, with his feet seemingly headed in all directions. Humphrey&#x27;s foil is most often Donald Duck, one of his antagonists; otherwise it is typically an officious park ranger voiced by Bill Thompson. The ranger&#x27;s name was never identified in the theatrical shorts, but when the films were re-edited into an hour-long Disney TV episode, he was referred to as J. Audubon Woodlore.

==Popularity==
The films were popular in theaters, and the character was familiar enough to be included in the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; opening (Humphrey is one of the characters who holds the trampoline that bounces Mickey Mouse in the air).

==Later appearances==
Although the series Humphrey starred in enjoyed only a short run, a later generation of Disney artists and directors remembered Humphrey fondly, and cast him in episodes of &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;, &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;. Humphrey returned to the screen in three new shorts: &quot;Donald&#x27;s Grizzly Guest&quot; and &quot;Donald&#x27;s Fish Fry&quot; reunite Humphrey with Donald Duck, and in &quot;Hot Tub Humphrey&quot; Humphrey is once again in the title role, alongside Ranger Woodlore. In these appearances, his vocals alternated between Frank Welker and Jim Cummings. Due to adding Humphrey to these Disney programs he became a more current character and can be seen in more Disney-related merchandise such as watches, cards, pins, T-shirts, and posters. In 2018, he returned in the series &quot;Legend of the Three Caballeros&quot;, where he is re-imagined as a bear rug reanimated by a magical artifact called the Spark of Life. He later made a cameo in &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;, where he is seen doing a dance and picking up trash on the floor in the background when Vanellope visits OhMyDisney.com. He has a cameo appearance in the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, where he rode in an elevator to take a group photo with several other Disney characters.

==Comic book appearances==
Humphrey appeared in two American comic stories drawn by Paul Murry in 1959 and in another one drawn by Tony Strobl in 1966. Strobl also drew comic stories with Humphrey for the market outside of the US, most of them also featuring Grandma Duck. Ed Nofziger wrote scripts for many foreign market stories with Humphrey. Most of those ones were drawn by cartoonists of the Argentinian art studio &quot;Jaime Diaz Studio&quot;.

==Popular culture==
Jack Hannah, who directed the 1950s Humphrey shorts, revived the &quot;dumb bear&quot; idea for Walter Lantz&#x27;s &quot;Fatso the Bear&quot; cartoons in 1960 and 1961. It would also seem probable that the Hanna-Barbera animation studio was somewhat inspired by Humphrey in its creation of the somewhat smarter Yogi Bear (from 1958), who lives at Jellystone Park, begs, steals, and plays tricks to steal picnic baskets from campers, and is constantly on the lookout for Ranger Smith.

Humphrey is currently the spokescharacter for Disney&#x27;s Wilderness Lodge Resort at Walt Disney World in Florida. He is featured on the totem pole in the lobby along with Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy. His merchandise is featured in the Briar Patch in the Magic Kingdom.

<doc id="242024" wikidata="Q676459" url="?curid=242024" title="Bank account">
<text>A bank account is a financial account maintained by a bank or other financial institution in which the financial transactions between the bank and a customer are recorded. Each financial institution sets the terms and conditions for each type of account it offers, which are classified in commonly understood types, such as deposit accounts, credit card accounts, current accounts, loan accounts or many other types of account. A customer may have more than one account. Once an account is opened, funds entrusted by the customer to the financial institution on deposit are recorded in the account designated by the customer. Funds can be withdrawn from the accounts in accordance with their terms and conditions.

The financial transactions which have occurred on a bank account within a given period of time are reported to the customer on a bank statement, and the balance of the accounts of a customer at any point in time represents their financial position with the institution..

==Nature of a bank account==
In most legal systems, a deposit of funds in a bank is not a bailment; that is, the actual funds deposited by a person in a bank cease to be the property of the depositor and become the property of the bank. The depositor acquires a claim against the bank for the sum deposited but not to the actual cash handed over to the bank. In accounting terms, the bank creates (&quot;opens&quot;) an account in the name of the depositor or a name directed by the depositor in which the amount received is recorded as a transaction. The deposit account is a &quot;liability&quot; of the bank and an &quot;asset&quot; of the depositor (the account holder).

On the other hand, a bank can lend some or all of the money it has on deposit to third parties. Such accounts, generally called loan or credit accounts, are subject to similar but reverse principles of a deposit account. In accounting terms, a loan account is an &quot;asset&quot; of the bank and a &quot;liability&quot; of the borrower. Loan accounts may be unsecured or secured with collateral from the borrower, and they may be guaranteed by a third person, with or without security.

Each financial institution sets the terms and conditions for each type of account it offers, and when a customer applies for the opening of an account, and is accepted by the institution, they form the contract between the financial institution and the customer in relation to the account.

The laws of each country specify how bank accounts may be opened and operated. They may specify who may open an account, for example, how the signatories can identify themselves, deposit and withdrawal limits among other specifications.

The minimum age for opening a bank account is most commonly 18 years. However, in some countries, the minimum age to open a bank account can be 16 years, and accounts may be opened in the name of minors but operated by their parent or guardian. In general, it is unlawful to open an account in a false name.

== Account structure ==
From the customer&#x27;s point of view, bank accounts may have a positive, or &quot;credit&quot; balance, when the financial institution owes money to the customer; or a negative, or &quot;debit&quot; balance, when the customer owes the financial institution money.

Broadly, accounts that hold credit balances are referred to as deposit accounts, and accounts opened to hold debit balances are referred to as loan accounts. Some accounts can switch between credit and debit balances.

Some accounts are categorized by the function rather than nature of the balance they hold, such as savings account, which routinely are in credit.

Financial institutions have an account numbering scheme to identify each account, which is important as a customer may have multiple accounts.

==Types of accounts== 
Each financial institution has its own names for the various accounts it offers to customers, but these can be categorised as:

* Bank statement

<text>Hardee&#x27;s Restaurants LLC is an American fast-food restaurant chain operated by CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. (&quot;CKE&quot;) with locations primarily in the Southern and Midwestern United States. The company has evolved through several corporate ownerships since its establishment in 1960 in North Carolina.

In April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl&#x27;s Jr., paid $327 million to Montreal-based Imasco Limited for Hardee&#x27;s. The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants – 3,152 Hardee&#x27;s outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl&#x27;s Jr. outlets, primarily in California. In June 2018, former CKE CEO Jason Marker announced that Carl&#x27;s Jr. and Hardee&#x27;s would become separate brands, claiming that CKE&#x27;s racy advertising and marketing campaigns were incompatible with a family-oriented chain like Hardee&#x27;s. In April 2019, Ned Lyerly, a 30-year veteran of the company and formerly president of CKE&#x27;s International division, was named CEO, replacing Jason Marker.

==History==
Wilber Hardee (1918–2008) opened his namesake restaurant in Greenville, North Carolina, on September 3, 1960. After a year of success, Wilber decided to look into expanding his restaurant and opening another location so he met with James Gardner and Leonard Rawls to discuss doing so. Shortly thereafter, the first company store was opened in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in May 1961 by James Carson Gardner and Leonard Rawls at 329 North Church Street in Rocky Mount, known within the chain as building number 1. That location was demolished in 2007 and replaced with a veterans&#x27; park named for Jack Laughery, a former Hardee&#x27;s chairman and military veteran.

According to Wilber Hardee, Gardner and Rawls won a controlling share of the company from him during a game of poker. After realizing that he had lost control over his namesake company, Hardee sold his remaining shares to them as well.

However, this story has been disputed by Gardner &amp; Rawls, who bought out Wilber Hardee and began establishing franchises in 1961. According to Jack Laughery, CEO of Hardee&#x27;s from 1975 to 1990, &quot;Leonard put together an organization with relatively little capital. If it weren&#x27;t for him and Jim Gardner, there wouldn&#x27;t be anything of Hardee&#x27;s Food Systems.&quot;

Rawls and Gardner sold their first franchises to a small group of longtime friends and acquaintances who formed their own companies and over time, built hundreds more franchised locations. Hardee&#x27;s Food Systems went public in 1963 with Rawls as president. Gardner, who was vice president, had political ambitions and left the company when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1966.

The 1964 menu included hamburger for 15 cents, cheeseburgers for 20 cents, french fries for 10 cents, apple turnovers for 15 cents, milk for 12 cents, coffee for 10 cents, soft drinks for 10 cents, and milkshakes (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla) for 20 cents. Strawberry milkshakes were created from vanilla by addition of a berry syrup which had to be mixed with a spindle.
At the end of the 1960s, the corporation operated nearly 200 restaurants in the Midwest and Southeastern U.S., as well as its first international locations in West Germany. Around this same time, Hardee&#x27;s began an expansion into the mid-Atlantic states, notably Southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. The expansion was done via the franchisee Hardee Northern, Inc, which was a subsidiary of Acme Markets, a prominent grocery store chain based in Philadelphia.

Hardee&#x27;s purchased Sandy&#x27;s in 1972. During the mid-and-late 1970s, Hardee&#x27;s saw rapid chain growth and high profits on the strength of its two key sandwiches: the &quot;Big Twin&quot; and the &quot;Big Deluxe&quot;. Another acquisition occurred in the late 1970s when Hardee&#x27;s purchased the Utah-based burger chain Dee&#x27;s Drive-In. In 1977; following a test run at a Virginia Beach location owned by longtime Hardee&#x27;s franchise operator Boddie-Noell Enterprises, Hardee&#x27;s introduced its breakfast menu and its Made from Scratch breakfast biscuits nationwide.
Hardee&#x27;s was purchased by Canadian company Imasco Limited in 1981. In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to Imasco for $44 million. Imasco converted many locations to Hardee&#x27;s restaurants and let franchises and locations near existing Hardee&#x27;s locations convert to other brands. Remaining restaurants that did not convert to Hardee&#x27;s or new names and branding simply closed.

A new management team, in the early 1980s, seeking to cut costs, changed the signature burger recipe and eliminated the flagship menu item, the Big Twin. The Big Deluxe continued to be offered throughout the 1990s.

For a few years after acquiring the Roy Rogers Restaurants fast food chain in the early 1990s, Hardee&#x27;s outlets sold fried chicken prepared using the popular Roy Rogers Restaurant recipe hoping it could compete with KFC. In addition to Roy Rogers, Hardee&#x27;s also owned Rax Roast Beef for a period of time and sold roast beef sandwiches throughout the Hardee&#x27;s system.

===Merger with Carl&#x27;s Jr. and aftermath===
In April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl&#x27;s Jr., bought Hardee&#x27;s from Imasco for $327 million. The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants – 3,152 Hardee&#x27;s outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl&#x27;s Jr. outlets primarily in California. Initially, the plan was for the larger Hardee&#x27;s chain to completely rebrand as Carl&#x27;s Jr but continue to offer Hardee&#x27;s existing breakfast menu branded as &quot;Hardee&#x27;s breakfast&quot; (due to Hardee&#x27;s stronger sales during breakfast hours, unusual among fast food chains), and even ran a test by rebranding Hardee&#x27;s locations in the Peoria, Illinois and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma markets as Carl&#x27;s Jr. However, by 1999 CKE instead rebranded Hardee&#x27;s into the Carl&#x27;s Jr. imaging including the Happy Star logo and parts of its lunch menu but kept the Hardee&#x27;s name and left the breakfast menu intact, though the Oklahoma City locations kept the Carl&#x27;s Jr. branding permanently.

In 2001, Hardee&#x27;s headquarters moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In 2005, Hardee&#x27;s introduced Hand-Scooped Ice Cream Shakes &amp; Malts.

In September 2013, it was announced that Hardee&#x27;s would expand into the Northeastern United States. In April 2015, Hardee&#x27;s announced the opening of its 300th restaurant in the Middle East with longtime franchisee, The Americana Group.

In 2015, Nation&#x27;s Restaurant News ranked Hardee&#x27;s as the No. 28 foodservice chain by sales in the United States through 2011. Carl&#x27;s Jr. was ranked at No. 37. Combined sales would rank the two at No. 15. In 2013, QSR listed Hardee&#x27;s at No. 20 and Carl&#x27;s Jr. at No. 24; if combined they would have been listed at No. 14.

In July 2015, Hardee&#x27;s announced that it would be offering The All-Natural Burger, which launched at sister-chain Carl&#x27;s Jr. restaurants in December 2014.

As of March 2016, CKE has a total of 3,664 franchised or company-operated restaurants in 44 states and 37 foreign countries and U.S. territories.

==Controversies, disputes, and legal issues==
===Burger Chef trademark dispute===
In January 2007, Hardee&#x27;s had a challenge filed against it with the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office by River West Brands, LLC of Chicago for the use of the Burger Chef trademark and name. Shortly thereafter, Hardee&#x27;s reissued the Burger Chef Big Shef sandwich in Terre Haute, Indiana, as a trial offering and later in additional Indiana markets and Dayton, Ohio, for a limited time. The reissue of the Big Shef has also used the Burger Chef name and logo in advertisements in the markets in which it is offered, and has claimed to provide Burger Chef fans with their Big Shef &quot;fix&quot;. On April 16, 2009, River West Brands dropped their petition for cancellation and both parties agreed to pay their own attorney&#x27;s fees.

===Harvey&#x27;s controversy===
Due to a trademark dispute with Canada&#x27;s Harvey&#x27;s burger chain, the Hardee&#x27;s brand name cannot be used in the country. Instead, CKE Restaurants operates exclusively under the Carl&#x27;s Jr. banner.

==Advertising==

A new Hardee&#x27;s logo was unveiled in 2006 that featured script lettering and retained the iconic Happy Star, further unifying the Hardee&#x27;s and Carl&#x27;s Jr. brands. Hardee&#x27;s also marketed special Super Bowl celebratory pins in the early 1990s.

===Controversy===
Several Hardee&#x27;s ad campaigns in the 2000s have been criticized by groups including Parents Television Council for their sexually suggestive nature. A campaign titled &quot;More Than a Piece of Meat&quot; featured scantily clad women appearing to receive sexual gratification from consuming Hardee&#x27;s products, and &quot;Name Our Holes&quot; – an ad campaign and website promoting Hardee&#x27;s Biscuit Holes.

In January 2015, Carl&#x27;s Jr. released a commercial online featuring model Charlotte McKinney advertising its new All Natural Burger to air regionally during Super Bowl XLIX. The ad features McKinney walking around a farmers&#x27; market, implying that she is &quot;all natural&quot; and uses double entendres to suggest that she is naked with strategically placed items in the market until it reveals McKinney in a bikini eating the All Natural Burger. Critics suggested that the ad &quot;sets feminism back four decades,&quot; while others, including McKinney&#x27;s elderly grandfather, enjoyed the ad. Until the YouTube video of the ad was privatized by Carl&#x27;s Jr. in March 2017, it had over 13 million views and 10 thousand likes.

===Carl Hardee Sr. campaign===
In March 2017, Hardee&#x27;s began to move away from the sexualized ads by releasing a commercial featuring a white bearded character played by Charles Esten as &quot;Carl Hardee Sr.&quot; who had come back into the office (much to the delight of the employees) to find his son (Drew Tarver), a.k.a. &quot;Carl Jr.&quot; who was focusing on sex appeal over its food. The commercial marked a turning point in CKE&#x27;s advertising, as the company wanted to move away from its provocative ads and focus more on food and as a competitor to Five Guys, Steak &#x27;n Shake, and In-N-Out Burger. &quot;Carl Hardee Sr.&quot; was also expected to become the new company spokesperson.

===Tastes Like America===
In 2018, CKE resumed producing separate campaigns for their Hardee&#x27;s and Carl&#x27;s Jr. brands. For Hardee&#x27;s, it started the &quot;Tastes Like America&quot; campaign with music by Big Wet. For this campaign, Hardee&#x27;s restored its 1976 logo, now in white; however, the Happy Star still appears, replacing the A in &quot;Tastes&quot;. The previous logo will also continue to be used as well.

==International franchises==
Many international Hardee&#x27;s franchises are located in countries in the Middle East and Pakistan, most being owned and operated by Americana Group. The Americana Group opened the Middle East&#x27;s first Hardee&#x27;s restaurant in Kuwait in June 1980. As of 2016, there are over 300 Hardee&#x27;s restaurants throughout Asia and the Middle East, specifically in Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and plans to open in Israel. Singapore had a Hardee&#x27;s franchise first opened in 1984, but the last three outlets closed in 1988. Hardee&#x27;s opened a store in South Korea in 1990, but it pulled in 2004, due to poor performance. Hardee&#x27;s also used to operate in Hong Kong, but it pulled out in 2006, due to licensing issues with its US parent. Specifically, in the Middle East, the Hardee&#x27;s menu does not include any pork items and each beef is certified Halal due to religious and cultural beliefs. The same menu is offered at Hardee&#x27;s locations in Pakistan, which opened its first location in the country in 2009 in Lahore. Hardee&#x27;s currently has 18 locations in Pakistan, with six in Lahore, four in Karachi, two each in Islamabad and Rawalpindi and one each in Faisalabad, Bhera, Peshawar and Multan. In 2014, it opened a restaurant in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan.

There is also a Hardee&#x27;s location at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi, Kenya, Africa.

<text>Word of mouth is the passing of information from person to person using oral communication, which could be as simple as telling someone the time of day. Storytelling is a common form of word-of-mouth communication where one person tells others a story about a real event or something made up. Oral tradition is cultural material and traditions transmitted by word of mouth through successive generations. Storytelling and oral tradition are forms of word of mouth that play important roles in folklore and mythology. Another example of oral communication is oral history—the recording, preservation and interpretation of historical information, based on the personal experiences and opinions of the speaker. Oral history preservation is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of oral history materials collected by word of mouth, whatever format they may be in.

==Storytelling==
Storytelling often involves improvisation or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and in order to instill moral values.

The earliest forms of storytelling were thought to have been primarily oral combined with gesture storytelling for many of the ancient cultures. The Australian Aboriginal people painted symbols from stories on cave walls as a means of helping the storyteller remember the story. The story was then told using a combination of oral narrative, music, rock art, and dance.

Traditionally, oral stories were committed to memory and then passed from generation to generation. However, in literate societies, written, televised, and internet media have largely replaced this method of communicating local, family, and cultural histories. Oral storytelling remains the dominant medium of learning in some countries with low literacy rates.

==Oral tradition==
Oral tradition (sometimes referred to as &quot;oral culture&quot; or &quot;oral lore&quot;) is cultural material and traditions transmitted orally from one generation to another. The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledges across generations without a writing system.

Sociologists emphasize a requirement that the material is held in common by a group of people, over several generations, and thus distinguish oral tradition from testimony or oral history. In a general sense, &quot;oral tradition&quot; refers to the transmission of cultural material through vocal utterance, and was long held to be a key descriptor of folklore (a criterion no longer rigidly held by all folklorists). As an academic discipline, it refers both to a set of objects of study and a method by which they are studied—the method may be called variously &quot;oral traditional theory&quot;, &quot;the theory of Oral-Formulaic Composition&quot; and the &quot;Parry-Lord theory&quot; (after two of its founders). The study of oral tradition is distinct from the academic discipline of oral history, which is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events. It is also distinct from the study of orality, which can be defined as thought and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.

==Oral history==
Oral history is the recording of personal memories and histories of those who experienced historical eras or events. Oral history is a method of historical documentation, using interviews with living survivors of the time being investigated. Oral history often touches on topics scarcely touched on by written documents, and by doing so, fills in the gaps of records that make up early historical documents. Oral history preservation is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of oral history materials, whatever format they may be in.

== Verbal communication ==
Verbal communication in the literal sense is oral communication with words that a person or other people speak out loud.

== Social media ==
Social media is a form of electronic communication through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos). Social media involves the way individuals communicate with others online. Social media in itself is not word of mouth, but it is one way that word of mouth spreads. In fact, half of all word of mouth takes place online. Practitioners have started using electronic word of mouth for consumer insight through text analytics, sentiment, hashtag analytics, and other machine learning tools. However, researchers of the Keller Fay Group found discussions are often face-to-face and not primarily dominated by social media. Alluding to offline word of mouth (real life conversations) being just as persuasive as online word of mouth.

Researchers argue that social media itself is not word of mouth, but rather a medium through which word of mouth spreads. Word of mouth is a story or verbal recommendation, as some researchers view social media as a mechanism. Social media is thus a big part of how word of mouth travels between people.

==Systems==
Long-established systems using word-of-mouth include:

* the &quot;grapevine&quot;
* the salon
* the &quot;bush telegraph&quot;
* the lecture circuit
* preaching

<doc id="242031" wikidata="Q210069" url="?curid=242031" title="Milton Obote">
<text>Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 – 10 October 2005) was a Ugandan politician who served as the second prime minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and the second president of Uganda from 1966 to 1971 and later from 1980 to 1985.

A Lango, Obote studied at the Busoga College and Makerere University. In 1956, he joined the Uganda National Congress (UNC) and later split away by founding the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) in 1960. After Uganda gained independence from British colonial rule in 1962, Obote was sworn in as prime minister in a coalition with the Kabaka Yekka, whose leader Mutesa II was named president. Due to a rift with Mutesa over the 1964 Ugandan lost counties referendum and later getting implicated in a gold smuggling scandal, Obote overthrew him in 1966 and declared himself president, establishing a dictatorial regime with the UPC as the sole official party in 1969. As president, Obote implemented ostensibly socialist policies, under which the country suffered from severe corruption and food shortages.

He was overthrown in a military coup d&#x27;état by Idi Amin in 1971, settling in exile in Tanzania, but was re-elected in an election reported to be neither free nor fair in 1980, a year after Amin&#x27;s 1979 overthrow. His second period of rule ended after a long and bloody conflict known as the Ugandan Bush War during which he was overthrown a second time by another coup d&#x27;état in 1985 led by Tito Okello, prompting him to live the rest of his life in exile.

==Early life==
Apollo Milton Obote was born in the Akokoro village in the Apac district in northern Uganda, on 28 December 1925. He was the third born of nine children of a tribal chief of the Oyima clan Lango ethnic group. He began his education in 1940 at the Protestant Missionary School in Lira, and later attended Gulu Junior Secondary School, Busoga College, Mwiri and eventually university at Makerere University. Having intended to study law, a subject not taught at the university, Obote took a general arts course, including English and geography. At Makerere, Obote honed his natural oratorical skills; he may have been expelled for participating in a student strike, or alternatively left after a place to study law abroad was not funded by the protectorate government. He worked in Buganda in southern Uganda before moving to Kenya, where he worked as a construction worker at an engineering firm.

While in Kenya, Obote became involved in the national independence movement. Upon returning to Uganda in 1956, he joined the political party Uganda National Congress (UNC), and was elected to the colonial Legislative Council in 1957. In 1959, the UNC split into two factions, with one faction under the leadership of Obote merging with the Uganda People&#x27;s Union to form the Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC).

Obote represented the UPC at the Ugandan Constitutional Conference, held at Lancaster House in 1961, alongside fellow Ugandan politician A. G. Mehta. The Conference was organised by the British Government to pave the way for Ugandan independence.

==Prime minister==
In the runup to independence elections, Obote formed a coalition with the Buganda royalist party, Kabaka Yekka. The two parties controlled a Parliamentary majority and Obote became prime minister in 1962. He assumed the post on 25 April 1962, appointed by Sir Walter Coutts, then Governor-General of Uganda. The following year the position of governor-general was replaced by a ceremonial presidency to be elected by the parliament. Mutesa, the &quot;Kabaka&quot; (King) of Buganda, became the ceremonial president, with Obote as executive prime minister.
In January 1964, a mutiny occurred at the military barracks at Jinja, Uganda&#x27;s second city and home to the 1st Battalion of the Uganda Army. There were similar mutinies in two other eastern African states; all three countries requested the support of troops from the British military. Before they arrived, however, Obote sent his defence minister Felix Onama to negotiate with the mutineers. Onama was held hostage, and agreed to many demands, including significant pay increases for the army, and the rapid promotion of many officers, including the future president Idi Amin. Later that year he participated in the 2nd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cairo. In 1965, Kenyans had been barred from leadership positions within the government, and this was followed by the removal of Kenyans en masse from Uganda in 1969, under Obote&#x27;s guidance.

As prime minister, Obote was implicated in a gold smuggling plot, together with Idi Amin, then deputy commander of the Ugandan armed forces. When the Parliament demanded an investigation of Obote and the ousting of Amin, he suspended the constitution and declared himself President in March 1966, allocating to himself almost unlimited power under state of emergency rulings. Several members of his cabinet, who were leaders of rival factions in the party, were arrested and detained without charge. Obote responded with an armed attack upon Mutesa&#x27;s palace, which ended with Mutesa fleeing to exile. In 1967, Obote&#x27;s power was cemented when the parliament passed a new constitution that abolished the federal structure of the independence constitution and created an executive presidency.

=== Attack on Muteesa&#x27;s Palace ===
The attack on Muteesa&#x27;s palace refers to a significant event that occurred during Milton Obote&#x27;s first reign of presidency in Uganda commonly known as the Mengo Crisis. On 24 May 1966, Obote ordered an assault on the (Lubiri) palace located at Mengo in Kampala, the residence of King (Kabaka) Edward Muteesa II of Buganda. The attack aimed to dislodge Muteesa from power and diminish his influence.

During the assault, the palace was heavily shelled, resulting in substantial damage notable of which were his Rolls Royce cars that were set on fire. Muteesa managed to escape and sought refuge in the British High Commission in Kampala, although his brother Prince Alexander David Ssimbwa was arrested. This incident marked a pivotal moment in Ugandan politics and had profound implications for the country&#x27;s future.

The attack on Muteesa&#x27;s palace was followed by Obote&#x27;s subsequent abolition of the kingdoms in Uganda, including Buganda, and the declaration of Uganda as a republic. This action led to heightened political unrest and ethnic tensions within the country.

The assault on Muteesa&#x27;s palace and its aftermath played a significant role in shaping Uganda&#x27;s political landscape. It contributed to the rise of Idi Amin, who later seized power in a military coup in 1971. Furthermore, it had long-lasting implications for the relationship between the central government and traditional institutions in Uganda.

==First presidency==
On 19 December 1969, there was an assassination attempt against Obote. As he was leaving the UPC annual delegates&#x27; conference at Lugogo Indoor Stadium in Kampala, Mohamed Sebaduka fired one shot at the president. The bullet struck Obote in the face, breaking two of his teeth and passing through his cheek. Sebaduka&#x27;s pistol jammed, and another assassin, Yowana Wamala, threw a grenade at the president, but it failed to explode. Sebaduka was shot by Obote&#x27;s bodyguards, but both conspirators escaped in the pandemonium following the attempt. Investigators later arrested them and several members of the Democratic Party—the leading opposition party—accusing former prime minister Benedicto Kiwanuka of orchestrating the plot. In the aftermath of the attempt, all opposition political parties were banned, leaving Obote as an effectively supreme leader. A state of emergency was in force for much of the time and many political opponents were jailed without trial for life. Obote&#x27;s regime terrorised, harassed, and tortured people. His secret police, the General Service Unit, led by Obote&#x27;s cousin, was responsible for many cruelties.

In 1969–70, Obote published a series of pamphlets that were supposed to outline his political and economic policy. &quot;The Common Man&#x27;s Charter&quot; was a summary of his approach to socialism, which became known as the Move to the Left. The government took over a 60% share in major private corporations and banks in the country in 1970. During Obote&#x27;s regime, flagrant and widespread corruption emerged in the name of his version of &quot;socialism&quot;. Food shortages sent prices through the ceiling. Obote&#x27;s persecution of Indian traders contributed to this rise in prices.

The Israeli government was training the Ugandan police and military and providing arms to the Anyanya in Southern Sudan who were engaged in a guerilla war with the Sudanese government. The Obote government withdrew support for the rebels and arrested a German mercenary called Steiner and extradited him to Sudan for trial. The Israeli government was unhappy with these events.

In January 1971, Obote was overthrown by the army while on a visit to Singapore to attend a Commonwealth conference, and Amin became president. In the two years before the coup Obote&#x27;s relations with the West had become strained. Some have suggested that Western Governments were at least aware of, and may have aided, the coup. The Israeli government certainly played an active role in planning and implementing the coup. They operated mechanized equipment and maintained a high profile in and around the capital including manning roadblocks. According to one source, &quot;They were to be seen everywhere.&quot; The fall of Obote&#x27;s regime was welcomed and celebrated by many Ugandans.

== First exile and attempts to regain power ==
Once he was informed of the coup, Obote immediately flew to Nairobi to rally loyalist army elements in Uganda to oppose Amin&#x27;s takeover. However, Kenyan authorities blocked his attempts to contact his followers, and the remaining pro-Obote soldiers failed to organize a counteroffensive. The pro-Amin forces were consequently able to swiftly eliminate them in a series of purges. Still, Obote refused to give up, and moved to Tanzania where he received much more support. Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation. The Tanzanian and Somali governments initially planned to help Obote regain power by invading Uganda through the Kagera Salient. This project was never implemented, as Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai informed the involved parties that he opposed a military intervention, while the Tanzanians feared that Western powers might intervene on Amin&#x27;s side. At this point, Obote&#x27;s loyalists in the Uganda Army had been crushed, and Nyerere offered Obote training camps in Tanzania to organize a guerrilla army in exile. Meanwhile, thousands of Obote supporters (including many soldiers) escaped to Sudan whose government also offered them sanctuary and training camps. From late March 1971, Obote built up a rebel army, and moved to Sudan.

However, Obote&#x27;s exile efforts were hampered by his lack of support among Ugandans, as many other opposition groups—both leftists and conservatives—were more willing to support Amin than offer him any aid. Even part of the UPC had decided to split from him. There were also considerable ethnic tensions as well as personal rivalries in Obote&#x27;s camps, undermining the military training. In addition, the Sudanese government signed a treaty with Amin in early 1972, expelling Obote and his followers, greatly weakening them. Overall, Obote was unable to mobilize more than about 1,000 insurgents, many of whom lacked proper training. As tensions mounted between Tanzania and Uganda, even escalating in occasional border clashes, Nyerere finally greenlit the planned invasion. Even some exiles critical of Obote, such as Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s group, joined the operation. The 1972 invasion of Uganda by Obote&#x27;s rebel alliance was a military disaster, with much of the insurgent force destroyed. This failure contributed to the existing tensions among the anti-Amin forces. On his part, Obote would accuse Museveni of having lied about controlling an underground network in southern Uganda. This alleged network was supposed to cause a popular uprising, but the latter did not materialize, thereby contributing to the invasion&#x27;s defeat. Obote never forgave Museveni for this, creating a lasting rift. The attempted invasion was also met with international condemnation, forcing the Tanzanian government to officially close the insurgent camps and pledge to stop supporting anti-Amin rebels. Obote and members of his inner circle consequently relocated to Dar es Salaam where many began to work as teachers, lawyers, doctors, etc., while his common fighters were moved to Tabora to become coffee farmers.

The Tanzanian government informed Obote that it would continue tolerating anti-Amin insurgent activities as long as they remained clandestine, despite the international agreement signed after the failed invasion. As a result, Obote kept a low-profile in the next years, as he continued his efforts to regain power. As he had not siphoned off money to overseas banks during his first presidency, Obote mostly lived off a Tanzanian pension. He gave no more interviews, and rarely ventured abroad to meet other opposition figures. Most of the time, he stayed at a comfortable beach house close to Nyerere&#x27;s private residence; Tanzanian officials initially continued to call him &quot;President&quot;, and later &quot;Mzee&quot;. Despite his rare public appearances and public restraint, Obote vigorously plotted to overthrow Amin: He set up a small rebel force of 100 guerrillas which occasionally launched raids from Kenya into Uganda, and created his own &quot;navy&quot; of six boats which smuggled coffee on Lake Victoria to finance political and militant activities. The navy also built up an underground network in Uganda. These operations were entrusted to some of his most trusted followers such as David Oyite-Ojok. Obote hoped to gradually undermine Amin&#x27;s regime until being able to launch a general uprising with support by the exiles in Tanzania. However, the efforts of his rebel network produced few tangible results, as his movement was unable to assassinate important followers of Amin and lacked support among most Ugandans. In fact, Obote remained deeply unpopular in much of Uganda, and even those opposed to Amin did not want to see him return to power.

== Second presidency ==

In 1979, Idi Amin was ousted by Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles. By 1980, Uganda was governed by an interim Presidential Commission. At the time of the 1980 elections, the chairman of the commission was a close associate of Obote, Paulo Muwanga. Muwanga had briefly been the &quot;de facto&quot; President of Uganda from 12–20 May 1980, as one of three presidents who served for short periods of time between Amin&#x27;s ousting and the setting up of the Presidential Commission. The other two presidents were Yusuf Lule and Godfrey Binaisa.

The elections in 1980 were won by Obote&#x27;s Uganda People&#x27;s Congress (UPC) party. However, the UPC&#x27;s opposition believed that the elections were rigged, which led to a guerrilla war by Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s National Resistance Army (NRA) and several other military groups. Obote held the additional title of Minister of Finance.

In 1983, the Obote government launched Operation Bonanza, a military expedition that claimed tens of thousands of lives and displaced a significant portion of the population. The brunt of the blame for this massacre was placed on the people of northern Uganda for supporting the action of the Prime Minister which increased the existing regional tensions in the country. It has been estimated that approximately 100,000 to 500,000 people died as a result of fighting between Obote&#x27;s Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA) and the guerrillas.

On 27 July 1985, Obote was deposed again. As in 1971, he was overthrown by his own army commanders in a military coup d&#x27;état; this time the commanders were Brigadier Bazilio Olara-Okello and General Tito Okello. The two men briefly ruled the country through a Military Council, but after a few months of near-chaos, Museveni&#x27;s NRA seized control of the country. By July 1985, Amnesty International estimated that the Obote regime had been responsible for more than 300,000 civilian deaths across Uganda. Abuses were particularly conspicuous in an area of central Uganda known as the Luweero Triangle.

==Death in exile==
After his second removal from power, Obote fled to Kenya and later to Zambia. For some years, it was rumoured that he would return to Ugandan politics. In August 2005, however, he announced his intention to step down as leader of the UPC. In September 2005, it was reported that Obote would return to Uganda before the end of the year. On 10 October 2005, Obote died of kidney failure in a hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa at the age of 79.
Milton Obote was given a state funeral, attended by President Museveni, in the Ugandan capital Kampala in October 2005, to the surprise and appreciation of many Ugandans because he and Museveni had been bitter rivals. Other groups, such as the Baganda survivors of the Luweero Triangle massacres, were bitter that Obote was given a state funeral.

He was survived by his wife and five children. On 28 November 2005, his wife Miria Obote was elected UPC&#x27;s president.

<text>South Park is a grassland flat within the basin formed by the Rocky Mountains&#x27; Mosquito and Park Mountain Ranges within central Colorado. This high valley ranges in elevation from approximately 9,000 to 10,000 ft (3,000 m). It encompasses approximately 1,000 square miles (2,590 km2 or 640,000 acres) around the headwaters of the South Platte River in Park County approximately 60 mi (100 km) southwest of Denver. It is the largest and southernmost of three similarly named high elevation basins in the Front Range of Colorado, the others being North Park and Middle Park. The largest town in the basin is Fairplay, with a population of 724.

==Geology==
Geologically, the valley is a wide faulted syncline of sedimentary rocks, sitting between the predominantly Precambrian igneous rocks of the Front Range to the east and the Sawatch Uplift to the west. The Mosquito Range forms a high barrier along the western side of the valley. The long-extinct Thirty-Nine Mile volcanic field is located just to the southeast.

The valley is mostly underlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks concealed by a thin layer of gravel laid down by glaciation during Pleistocene time. The underlying rocks are dipping slightly to the east. The eastern (and newer) side of the valley is underlain primarily by Pierre Shale laid down during Cretaceous time. The western (and older) side of the valley, on the west side of Red Hill, is underlain primarily by Permian and Pennsylvanian rocks. Red Hill runs through the center of the valley as a hogback ridge of tilted Cretaceous and Jurassic sedimentary rocks.

===Gold===
Gold mining in South Park began in 1859. Extensive placer deposits were mined along the west side of the park, and lode deposits were mined in the Mosquito Range. The extensive gravel ridges east of Fairplay are the result of dredging for gold. (&quot;see Gold mining in Colorado&quot;).

===Petroleum===
Although South Park contains some of the same geologic formations that yield oil and gas in the Denver Basin further east, efforts to find commercial oil and gas in South Park have so far proven unsuccessful.

===Uranium===
A minor amount of uranium has been mined from sandstone in South Park (&quot;see Uranium mining in Colorado&quot;).

==Transportation==

The valley is traversed by several highways, including U.S. Highway 285, which enters the valley from the eastern side over the Front Range at Kenosha Pass, providing a vehicle link to Denver. The highway crosses Red Hill at Red Hill Pass. On its northern side, the valley is connected by several high mountain passes to the valley of the North Fork of the South Platte River (a tributary of the South Platte). It is also connected by CO Route 9 via Hoosier Pass to the valley to the Blue River near Breckenridge. To the west, the extremely high Mosquito Pass crosses the Mosquito Range to Leadville. (Mosquito Pass is no longer a practical transportation route, but is now a historical and recreation site.) On its southwestern side, at the southern end of the Mosquito Range, it is connected by Trout Creek Pass to the upper valley of the Arkansas River near Buena Vista. U.S. Highway 24 enters South Park from the east at Wilkerson Pass, where the highway provides vehicle access to Colorado Springs. To the very south, CO Route 9 crosses Currant Creek Pass, which marks the southern edge of the South Park region.

==History==
Like much of the mountainous areas of Colorado, the valley was inhabited by Utes before the arrival of European settlers in the middle 19th century. However, from the 1850s onward, the area was increasingly encroached on by Southern Arapaho bands, who came to cherish it as an important buffalo range after witnessing the continued degradation of their typical hunting grounds on the plains and who repeatedly became entangled in skirmishes with the Utes over the territory. It was explored by John C. Fremont during his second expedition in 1844, at which time it was referred to as &quot;Bayou Salade&quot;, a corruption of Spanish &quot;Valle Salado&quot;, meaning salty valley. In 1859, the discovery of placer gold in the streams of the valley during the Colorado Gold Rush led to an influx of prospectors and miners. The town of Fairplay was founded as a more law-abiding place to live than the older, nearby town of Tarryall during this time and continued to be a center of gold, and later silver mining up through the middle 20th century. South Park City, an open-air museum outside Fairplay, provides a historical recreation of the gold rush days. The basin was connected to Denver by railroad with the extension of the Denver, South Park and Pacific Railroad over Kenosha Pass in 1879.

==In popular culture==
Since the late 1990s, South Park has been best-known as the eponymous setting of the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;. Trey Parker, one of the creators of the &quot;South Park&quot; series, grew up in Conifer, about 40 miles (65 km) east of Fairplay. According to Parker and co-creator Matt Stone, who is also a Colorado native, the area was well-known in Colorado for supernatural tall tales, UFO conspiracies and alien abduction stories that served as partial inspiration for the series.

<text>George Ames Plimpton (March 18, 1927 – September 25, 2003) was an American writer. He is known for his sports writing and for helping to found &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, as well as his patrician demeanor and accent. He was known for &quot;participatory journalism,&quot; including accounts of his active involvement in professional sporting events, acting in a Western, performing a comedy act at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and playing with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur. 

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his &quot;exploits in editing and writing seesawed between belles lettres and the witty accounts he wrote of his various madcap attempts to slip into other people&#x27;s high-profile careers ... a lanky, urbane man possessed of boundless energy and perpetual bonhomie, became, in 1953, the first and only editor of The Paris Review. A ubiquitous presence at book parties and other gala social events, he was tireless in his commitment to the serious, contemporary fiction the magazine publishes ... All of this contributed to the charm of reading about Mr. Plimpton&#x27;s frequently hapless adventures as &#x27;professional&#x27; athlete, stand-up comedian, movie bad guy or circus performer; which he chronicled in witty, elegant prose in nearly three dozen books.&quot;

==Early life==
Plimpton was born in New York City on March 18, 1927, and spent his childhood there, attending St. Bernard&#x27;s School and growing up in an apartment duplex on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side located at 1165 Fifth Avenue. During the summers, he lived in the hamlet of West Hills, Huntington, Suffolk County on Long Island.

He was the son of Francis T. P. Plimpton and the grandson of Frances Taylor Pearsons and George Arthur Plimpton. His father was a successful corporate lawyer and name partner of the law firm Debevoise and Plimpton; he was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations, serving from 1961 to 1965.

His mother was Pauline Ames, the daughter of botanist Oakes Ames (1874–1950) and artist Blanche Ames. Both of Plimpton&#x27;s maternal grandparents were born with the surname Ames; his mother was the granddaughter of Medal of Honor recipient Adelbert Ames (1835–1933), an American sailor, soldier, and politician, and Oliver Ames, a US political figure and the 35th Governor of Massachusetts (1887–1890). She was also the great-granddaughter on her father&#x27;s side of Oakes Ames (1804–1873), an industrialist and congressman who was implicated in the Crédit Mobilier railroad scandal of 1872; and Governor-General of New Orleans Benjamin Franklin Butler, an American lawyer and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States House of Representatives and later served as the 33rd Governor of Massachusetts.

Plimpton&#x27;s son described him as a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant and wrote that both of Plimpton&#x27;s parents were descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers.

George had three siblings: Francis Taylor Pearsons Plimpton Jr., Oakes Ames Plimpton, and Sarah Gay Plimpton.

==Education==
After St. Bernard&#x27;s School, Plimpton attended Phillips Exeter Academy (from which he was expelled just shy of graduation), and Daytona Beach High School, where he received his high school diploma, before entering Harvard College in July 1944. He wrote for the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club, Pi Eta, the Signet Society, and the Porcellian Club and majored in English. Plimpton entered Harvard as a member of the Class of 1948, but did not graduate until 1950 due to intervening military service. He was also an accomplished birdwatcher.

Plimpton&#x27;s studies at Harvard were interrupted by military service from 1945 to 1948, during which time he served in Italy as an Army tank driver. After finishing at Harvard in 1950, he attended King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, from 1950 to 1952, and graduated with third class honors in English.

==Career==
===&quot;The Paris Review&quot;===

In 1952, Plimpton was recruited by Peter Matthiessen to join the literary journal &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, founded by Matthiessen, Thomas H. Guinzburg, and Harold L. Humes. This periodical has carried great weight in the literary world, but has never been financially strong; for its first half-century, it was allegedly largely financed by its publishers and by Plimpton. Matthiessen took the magazine over from Humes and ousted him as editor, replacing him with Plimpton, using it as his cover for Matthiessen&#x27;s CIA activities. Jean Stein became Plimpton&#x27;s co-editor. Plimpton was associated with the Paris literary magazine &quot;Merlin&quot;, which folded because the State Department withdrew its support. Future Poet Laureate Donald Hall, who had met Plimpton at Exeter, was Poetry Editor. One of the magazine&#x27;s most notable discoveries was author and screenwriter Terry Southern, who was living in Paris at the time and formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton, along with writer Alexander Trocchi and future classical and jazz pioneer David Amram. In 1958, he published an influential article about Vali Myers. That same year, Plimpton interviewed Ernest Hemingway for the &quot;Review&quot;.

===Participatory journalism===

Plimpton was famous for competing in professional sporting events and then recording the experience from the point of view of an amateur. Per &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;As a &#x27;participatory journalist,&#x27; Mr. Plimpton believed that it was not enough for writers of nonfiction to simply observe; they needed to immerse themselves in whatever they were covering to understand fully what was involved. For example, he believed that football huddles and conversations on the bench constituted a &#x27;secret world, and if you&#x27;re a voyeur, you want to be down there, getting it firsthand&#x27;.&quot; He was influenced by Paul Gallico, about whom he said: &quot;What Gallico did was to climb down out of the press box.&quot; In 1958, prior to a post-season exhibition game at Yankee Stadium between teams managed by Willie Mays (National League) and Mickey Mantle (American League), Plimpton pitched against the National League. This experience was captured in &quot;Out of My League&quot; (1961). (He intended to face both line-ups, but tired badly and was relieved by Ralph Houk.) Plimpton sparred for three rounds with boxing greats Archie Moore and Sugar Ray Robinson while on assignment for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Hemingway praised &quot;Out of My League&quot; as &quot;beautifully observed and incredibly conceived, his account of a self-imposed ordeal that has the chilling quality of a true nightmare ... It is the dark side of the moon of Walter Mitty.&quot;

In 1963, Plimpton attended preseason training with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League as a backup quarterback, and he ran a few plays in an intrasquad scrimmage. These events were recalled in his best-known book, &quot;Paper Lion&quot; (1966), which was adapted as a 1968 film starring Alan Alda. Plimpton revisited pro football in 1971, this time joining the defending Super Bowl champion Baltimore Colts and seeing action in an exhibition game against his previous team, the Lions. These experiences served as the basis of &quot;Mad Ducks and Bears&quot; (1973), although much of the book dealt with the off-field escapades and observations of football friends Alex Karras (&quot;Mad Duck&quot;) and John Gordy (&quot;Bear&quot;). 

Plimpton&#x27;s &quot;The Bogey Man&quot; (1968) chronicles his attempt to play professional golf on the PGA Tour during the Nicklaus and Palmer era of the 1960s. Among other challenges for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, he attempted to play top-level bridge, and spent some time as a high-wire circus performer. Some of these events, such as his stint with the Colts, and an attempt at stand-up comedy, were presented on the ABC television network as a series of specials. &quot;Open Net&quot; (1985) saw him train as an ice hockey goalie with the Boston Bruins, even playing part of a National Hockey League preseason game. 

Among other adventures, he attempted &quot;acrobatics as an aerialist for the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus—he failed miserably&quot;. More happily, he tried &quot;his hand as a percussionist with the New York Philharmonic (where a miss-hit on the gong earned him the immediate applause of conductor Leonard Bernstein).&quot; 

===Sidd Finch===
In the April 1, 1985, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Plimpton pulled off a widely reported April Fools&#x27; Day prank. With the help of the New York Mets organization and several Mets players, Plimpton wrote an account of an unknown pitcher in the Mets spring training camp, Siddhartha Finch, who threw a baseball over 160 mph, wore a hiking boot on one foot, and was a practicing Buddhist who had studied yoga in Tibet. The article had many clues that the story was a prank, starting with the subheading: &quot;He&#x27;s a pitcher, part yogi and part recluse. Impressively liberated from our opulent life-style, Sidd&#x27;s deciding about yoga—and his future in baseball.&quot; This is an acrostic reading &quot;Happy April Fools&#x27; Day—a(h) fib&quot;. The article was so convincing that many readers believed it, and the popularity of the prank led to Plimpton expanding on Sidd&#x27;s story in &quot;The Curious Case of Sidd Finch&quot; (1987).

===Fireworks===
Plimpton was a demolitions expert in the post–World War II Army. After returning to New York from Paris, he routinely launched fireworks at his evening parties. His fireworks fascination flourished, and in 1975, in Bellport, Long Island, with Fireworks by Grucci, he attempted to break the record for the world&#x27;s largest firework. His firework, a Roman candle named &quot;Fat Man&quot;, weighed and was expected to rise to or more and deliver a wide starburst. When lit, the firework remained on the ground and exploded, blasting a crater wide and deep. A later attempt, fired at Cape Canaveral, rose approximately into the air and broke 700 windows in Titusville, Florida. 

With Felix Grucci, Plimpton competed in the 16th International Fireworks Festival in 1979 in Monte Carlo. After several problems with transporting and preparing the fireworks, Plimpton and Grucci became the first competitors from the United States to win the event. Plimpton was appointed Fireworks Commissioner of New York by Mayor John Lindsay, an unofficial post he held until his death. With the Grucci family, he helped choreograph the fireworks for the 1983 Brooklyn Bridge Centennial Celebration and for the second inauguration of Ronald Reagan. Plimpton&#x27;s passion for pyrotechnics led him to write &quot;Fireworks&quot; (1984), and he hosted an A&amp;E Home Video on the subject, featuring his many fireworks adventures with the Gruccis.

===Other writings=== 
Plimpton and Jean Stein edited an oral biography of Edie Sedgwick, &quot;Edie: An American Biography&quot; (1982). He appeared in a featurette about Sedgwick found on the &quot;Ciao! Manhattan&quot; DVD. He appeared in the PBS &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary on Andy Warhol and in the closing credits of the 2006 film &quot;Factory Girl&quot;. In 1998, Plimpton published an oral biography of Truman Capote. Between 2000 and 2003, he wrote the libretto to the opera &quot;Animal Tales&quot;, commissioned by Family Opera Initiative, with music by Kitty Brazelton and directed by Grethe Barrett Holby. He wrote, &quot;I suppose in a mild way there is a lesson to be learned for the young, or the young at heart – the gumption to get out and try one&#x27;s wings&quot;. In 2002, Plimpton collaborated with Terry Quinn on &quot;Zelda, Scott and Ernest&quot;, a play based on the correspondence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

===Documentary appearances=== 
In 1989, Plimpton appeared in the documentary &quot;The Tightrope Dancer&quot;, about the life and the work of the artist Vali Myers. In 1994, Plimpton appeared in the Ken Burns series &quot;Baseball&quot;, sharing personal baseball experiences and commenting on memorable events from the history of the game. In 1996, he appeared in the documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, about the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, the 1974 Ali-Foreman Championship fight. Plimpton credited Muhammad Ali as a poet who composed the world&#x27;s shortest poem: &quot;Me? Whee!!&quot;

===Acting===
Plimpton appeared in more than thirty films as an extra or in cameo appearances. He was a Bedouin in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1961), a thief in &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970), Tom Hanks&#x27;s antagonistic father in &quot;Volunteers&quot; (1985) and a psychologist in &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; (1997). Plimpton called himself &quot;the Prince of Cameos.&quot; He also appeared in television commercials in the early 1980s, including a memorable campaign for Mattel&#x27;s Intellivision. In this campaign, Plimpton touted the superiority regarding the graphics and sounds of Intellivision video games over the Atari 2600.

He hosted &quot;Mouseterpiece Theater&quot;, a &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; spoof featuring Disney cartoon shorts. He had a recurring role as the grandfather of Dr. Carter on &quot;ER&quot; and was a cast member of &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; (2001–02). In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can&quot;, he hosts the &quot;Spellympics&quot; and attempts to bribe Lisa to lose with the offer of a scholarship at a Seven Sisters College and a hot plate: &quot;it&#x27;s perfect for soup!&quot;

===Parodies of Plimpton&#x27;s career===
A November 6, 1971, cartoon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Whitney Darrow Jr. shows a cleaning lady on her hands and knees scrubbing an office floor while saying to another one: &quot;I&#x27;d like to see George Plimpton do &quot;this&quot; sometime.&quot; In another cartoon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, a patient looks up at the masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, &quot;Wait a minute! How do I know you&#x27;re not George Plimpton?&quot; A feature in &quot;Mad&quot; titled &quot;Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton&quot; spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York&#x27;s Times Square in the middle of the night, and spending a week with Jerry Lewis.

==Personal life==
Plimpton was known for his distinctive accent which, by Plimpton&#x27;s own admission, was often mistaken for an English accent. Plimpton himself described it as a &quot;New England cosmopolitan accent&quot; or &quot;Eastern seaboard cosmopolitan&quot; accent. His son, Taylor, described it as a mixture of &quot;old New England, old New York, tinged with a hint of King&#x27;s College King&#x27;s English.&quot;

Plimpton was married twice. His first wife, whom he married in 1968 and divorced in 1988, was Freddy Medora Espy, a photographer&#x27;s assistant. She was the daughter of writers Willard R. Espy and Hilda S. Cole, who had, earlier in her career, been a publicity agent for Kate Smith and Fred Waring. They had two children: Medora Ames Plimpton and Taylor Ames Plimpton, who has published a memoir entitled &quot;Notes from the Night: A Life After Dark&quot;.

In 1992, Plimpton married Sarah Whitehead Dudley, a graduate of Columbia University and a freelance writer. She is the daughter of James Chittenden Dudley, a managing partner of Manhattan-based investment firm Dudley and Company, and geologist Elisabeth Claypool. The Dudleys established the Highstead Arboretum in Redding, Connecticut. Plimpton and Dudley were the parents of twin daughters Laura Dudley Plimpton and Olivia Hartley Plimpton.

===Friendship with Robert F. Kennedy===
At Harvard, Plimpton was a classmate and close personal friend of Robert F. Kennedy. Plimpton, along with former decathlete Rafer Johnson and American football star Rosey Grier, was credited with helping wrestle Sirhan Sirhan to the floor when Kennedy was assassinated following his victory in the 1968 California Democratic primary at the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. Kennedy died the next day at Good Samaritan Hospital.

==Death and tributes==
Plimpton died on September 25, 2003, in his New York City apartment from a heart attack later determined to have been caused by a catecholamine surge. He was 76.

The annual &quot;Amateur Backgammon championships&quot; held in Las Vegas from 1978 onwards were called the &quot;Plimpton Cup&quot;.

Plimpton was made an officier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

An oral biography, &quot;George, Being George&quot; was edited by Nelson W. Aldrich Jr., and released on October 21, 2008. The book offers memories of Plimpton from Norman Mailer, William Styron, Gay Talese and Gore Vidal among other writers, and was written with the cooperation of both his ex-wife and his widow.

Plimpton was the subject of the &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary &quot;Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself&quot;. In it the writer James Salter said of Plimpton that &quot;he was writing in a genre that really doesn&#x27;t permit greatness.&quot; The film used archival audio and video of Plimpton lecturing and reading to create a posthumous narration.

In 2006, the musician Jonathan Coulton wrote the song entitled &quot;A Talk with George&quot;, a part of his &#x27;Thing a Week&#x27; series, in tribute to Plimpton&#x27;s many adventures and approach to life.

Plimpton is the protagonist of the semi-fictional &quot;George Plimpton&#x27;s Video Falconry&quot;, a 1983 ColecoVision game postulated by humorist John Hodgman and recreated by video game auteur Tom Fulp.

Researcher and writer Samuel Arbesman filed with NASA to name an asteroid after Plimpton; NASA issued the certificate 7932 Plimpton in 2009.
His final interview appeared in &quot;The New York Sports Express&quot; of October 2, 2003, by journalist Dave Hollander.

<text>The Pioneer Chicken Take Out Corporation, doing business as Pioneer Chicken, is an American fried chicken restaurant chain which was founded in Echo Park, Los Angeles in 1961 by H. R. Kaufman. During the 1970s, several locations operated in Honolulu on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. When Kaufman sold the chain in 1987, there were 270 restaurants operated by 220 franchisees. In 1993, Pioneer Chicken was taken over by AFC Enterprises, the parent company of Popeyes. Almost all Pioneer Chicken locations were then converted to Popeyes. The franchisees of two locations resisted the change, retaining the Pioneer Chicken branding: Los Angeles and Bell Gardens, California.

==Origins==
It was named after Pioneer Market, a now-defunct small chain of supermarkets in Los Angeles. The original location in Echo Park was located next to the Pioneer Market (the original 1932 market was razed in the 1980s due to the Sylmar earthquake) at Echo Park Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, which was replaced by a Walgreens Pharmacy in 2004. Due to considerable redevelopment activity in the neighborhood, the original Pioneer Chicken location was shut down in March 2009 and replaced by a Little Caesar&#x27;s Pizza the following year. During the 1980s, Los Angeles Lakers announcer Chick Hearn and former football player O. J. Simpson advertised for the restaurant.
Pioneer Chicken is remembered for its bright orange deep fried chicken, menu option of gizzards and livers as appetizers, and Pioneer Pete, the company mascot and protagonist in comic books that were provided with their kid&#x27;s meals.

==Bankruptcy==
In 1988 founder H. R. Kaufman and business associate Terrence P. Goggin filed for Chapter 11 in Federal Bankruptcy Court. At that point, Pioneer Chicken had 220 franchise owners and 270 stores. The company faltered under competition pressure from Kentucky Fried Chicken.

==AFC Enterprises acquisition==
In 1993, Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits owner AFC Enterprises purchased the franchise and converted most locations to Popeyes.

==Locations==

There are two remaining locations in the Los Angeles area: 1) 904 South Soto Street, Los Angeles; 2) 6323 East Florence Avenue, Bell Gardens.

===In Indonesia===
In 1983, three Indonesian alumni from the University of Southern California decided to open a Pioneer Chicken franchise in Jakarta under the name California Fried Chicken.

As of 2013, the parent company of the stores in Indonesia, Pioneerindo Gourmet International (formerly PT Putra Sejahtera Pioneerindo), have over 200 CFC restaurants throughout that nation. CFC had a few franchises in Shanghai during the 1990s, but they may not currently exist.

<text>NZ Post (), shortened from New Zealand Post, is a state-owned enterprise responsible for providing most postal service in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Post Office, a government agency, provided postal, banking, and telecommunications services in New Zealand until 1987. By the 1980s, however, economic difficulties made the government reconsider how it delivered postal services. For example, in 1987–1988, the postal division lost NZ$50 million. In 1985, the Labour Party government under Prime Minister David Lange launched a review, led by New Zealand Motor Corporation CEO Roy Mason and KPMG New Zealand Chairman Michael Morris, to find solutions to the Post Office&#x27;s problems. In its final report, the team recommended transforming the New Zealand Post Office into three state-owned enterprises. The government in 1986 decided to follow the Mason-Morris review&#x27;s recommendations, and passed through parliament the State-Owned Enterprises Act, which corporatised several government agencies into state-owned enterprises. The Post Office&#x27;s corporatisation was then completed with the 1987 passage of the Postal Services Act. The two acts broke up the New Zealand Post Office into three corporations: the postal service firm New Zealand Post Limited, the savings bank Post Office Bank Limited, later rebranded as PostBank, and the telecommunications company Telecom New Zealand Limited. Today, only NZ Post remains a state-owned enterprise, as PostBank and Telecom were privatised in 1989 and 1990, respectively.

In its first year of operation, New Zealand Post turned the losses of previous years into a NZ$72 million profit.

A year after the 1987 Post Office Act, the Lange Government declared its plan to fully privatise the post. To prepare for privatisation, it decided to gradually reduce NZ Post&#x27;s monopoly. When it was corporatised in 1987, New Zealand Post had a monopoly for mail up to 500 grams and NZ$1.75 value. This was first reduced to $1.35, then $1, and finally 80 cents. The government also let NZ Post downsize by closing a third of its locations. In 1991–1992, another review came out in support of the government&#x27;s privatisation plan. However, by the end of 1993 the government abandoned its plan because of public opposition.

New Zealand Post began its life with 1,244 post offices, later rebranded as &quot;PostShops&quot;, of which 906 were full post offices and 338 were postal agencies. On 5 February 1988, 581 post offices or bank branches were downsized or closed, after government subsidies expired. As of March 1998, there were 297 PostShops and 705 Post Centres. However, there are now more outlets than before corporatisation, with 2,945 other retailers of postage stamps.

There was a reduction in the &quot;real&quot; price of postage, with a nominal drop of the standard letter postage rate from 45 cents to 40 cents in 1996, and restoration of the 45 cent rate in 2004. Since then the cost has risen to 50 cents in 2007, to 60 cents in 2010, to 70 cents in 2012, to 80 cents in 2014, to $1 in 2016, to $1.20 in 2018, to $1.30 in 2019, to $1.40 in 2020, to $1.50 in 2021, to $1.70 in 2022, to $2.00 in 2023 and $2.30 in 2024, amidst significant declines in mail volumes.

== Regulation ==
The Lange government&#x27;s Postal Services Act 1987 reduced the monopoly of New Zealand Post to a limit of $1.75 and 500 grams. It was gradually reduced to 80 cents in December 1991 until the 1998 legislation took effect.
The Postal Services Act 1998, passed by a National-New Zealand First coalition government, repealed the 1987 Act. The new law provides for any person to become a registered postal operator by applying to the Ministry of Economic Development (now Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment). Registration as a postal operator is compulsory for letters with postage less than 80 cents. Despite the Act, government regulation of the company still requires it to maintain certain minimum service levels, such as frequency of delivery.

New Zealand Post&#x27;s exclusive right to be the &#x27;sole operator&#x27; under the Act for the purposes of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) expired on 1 April 2003. For practical purposes, this meant another postal operator could theoretically issue stamps identified simply as &#x27;New Zealand&#x27; with UPU membership. At around the same time, New Zealand Post adopted a fern-shaped identifying mark on its postage stamps, to be used on the majority of its future issues. As of 2024, New Zealand Post is one of three mail delivery providers in New Zealand to issue stamps, the others being its primary postal competitor DX Mail and the significantly smaller Whitestone Post.

Since 1998, NZ Post has been legally obliged to deliver six days a week. However, in 2013, the company outlined a plan to reduce this to three, in the wake of falling mail volumes. Prime Minister John Key backed the idea, saying people &quot;genuinely understand that the world is changing&quot;.

NZ Post is legally obligated to maintain a certain service level under a deed of understanding it signed with the New Zealand Government following the post&#x27;s corporatisation in 1987. According to the agreement, last amended in 2013, New Zealand Post has to operate at least 880 service points where basic postal services are available, and within this network 240 so-called “Personal Assistance Service Points,” where additional postal services, such as priority or parcel services, are available. As of 30 June 2016, New Zealand Post maintained 987 service points, 511 which were personal assistance service points. In all, the post operated 882 retail locations in mid-2016.
The standard of signature/non-signature parcel delivery services, varies with their customers sometimes left a mailbox card instructing them to pick up parcels from the nearest NZ Post Depot or if a small address discrepancy/address damage is discovered, the parcel is invariably returned to the sender, usually with no efforts directed toward telephoning, emailing or looking up the recipient in a directory, whist more effort is prioritised into delivering miss-addressed letters.

== Operations ==
===Mail and courier services===

In 1989, New Zealand Post established CourierPost, a nationwide courier company designed to protect the company&#x27;s parcel business from private competition. In 1991 it purchased Speedlink Parcels, formerly run by the New Zealand Railways when it was sold during privatisation. By 1998 CourierPost had become the number one player in the express courier market.

In 1999, New Zealand Post launched a 50:50 joint operation with Blue Star. The new brand – Books and More – combined bookshop operations with the more traditional PostShop services. After acquiring 100% of the company in 2004 (by this stage the other 50% had been owned by WH Smith, owner of Whitcoulls bookshops) the entire operation was eventually sold to Paper Plus in 2005 and by 2006 all had been re-branded as Take Note.

In 2002, New Zealand Post, as part of government policy, opened the bank Kiwibank Limited in the majority of its PostShop and Books and More (now Take Note) branches. Kiwibank is wholly owned by New Zealand Post through subsidiaries.

In 2002, NZ Post bought The ECN Group which is now New Zealand Post&#x27;s corporate venturing arm. Its purpose is to develop and market technologies and services that may replace or enhance New Zealand Post&#x27;s traditional services. The ECN Group focuses on B2B messaging, business process management and systems integration, with a presence in New Zealand, Australia and Asia.

New Zealand Post also owned 35% of IT firm Datacom Group until December 2012.

New Zealand Post also ran the Electoral Enrolment Centre as a business unit under contract to the Ministry of Justice. Its function was to compile and maintain all electoral rolls for parliamentary and local government elections.

On 6 July 2010, New Zealand Post registered a 100 percent stake in Localist Limited, a local directory and social media site focusing initially on the Auckland region. This holding was sold in 2014 in a management buyout led by the then CEO, Christine Domecq.

One of the ways New Zealand Post is trying to make up for lost revenue due to fewer people sending letters is partnering with other companies. The Post on 3 April 2017 announced that it will work with fast food restaurant chain KFC to have postal drivers deliver KFC&#x27;s food to customers. The partnership will be piloted in the northern city of Tauranga, then expanded to more locations across New Zealand.

On 24 June 2021, New Zealand Post announced a new logo and rebranding to unite their NZ Post, Pace and CourierPost brands into one brand in order to reduce confusion among customers. This rebranding exercise costs NZ$15 million and will take place over a period of three years; focusing on the repainting of courier vans. The company is also spending $170 million to establish new processing centres in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

In late June 2023, NZ Post chief executive David Walsh announced plans to lay off 750 jobs over the next five years due to declining mail volume. Total annual mail volume had declined from over 1 billion items in 2003 to around 220 million items in 2023. In late March 2024, NZ post confirmed it would proceed with plans to lay off 750 workers over the next five years due to declining mail volume.

In early April 2024, NZ Post confirmed that it would stop delivering newspapers and parcels to rural addresses on Saturdays from 29 June 2024, with the exception of 17 rural delivery runs that would be phased out by June 2025.

In early November 2024, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) proposed five changes to NZ Post&#x27;s services including reducing the frequency of mail deliveries in both urban and rural areas; gradually reducing the number of postal outlets from 880 to 400; establishing cluster and community boxes for new addresses; converting existing delivery points to community points at a rate of 5% per year; and reducing the review period from five to three years. The Postal Worker&#x27;s Union president John Maynard expressed concerns about NZ Post&#x27;s proposal to stop delivering to individual mail boxes.

=== Transport ===
Early mail was carried on foot and by ship. By 1875, of 330 mail routes, 83 used carts, or coaches. From 1878, post was carried in travelling post offices on New Zealand Railways, with sorting being done on the train. The last train ran on 5 September 1971, after which the Silver Star train took over Auckland-Wellington services.

Air transport was first used in 1919, and regular carriage by internal airlines began on 16 March 1936. Until 2016, NZ Post had a Boeing 737-300 and two Fokker 27 planes, which were replaced by three Boeing 737–400, with mail carried in containers.

An 12mph Albion petrol lorry began carrying mail between Wellington post office and the wharf from early in September 1909. Another arrived in 1911. By 1973, the Post Office had 1,600 Bedford J trucks.

In 2004, New Zealand Post announced the formation of Express Couriers Ltd (ECL), a 50:50 joint venture with courier company DHL. In 2008, New Zealand Post and DHL commenced a similar joint venture in Australia called Parcel Direct Group Pty Limited (PDG). In 2012, New Zealand Post purchased DHL&#x27;s holdings in these two companies. ECL operates extensive courier and logistics services throughout New Zealand and encompasses the CourierPost, Pace, RoadStar and Contract Logistics brands.

From 2016, electric Paxters were introduced for local deliveries. On average, they use a day. By 2022, there were 415 of them. In 2022 a Hyundai Xcient hydrogen-powered truck was introduced.

In 2022, NZ Post acquired Fliway Group one of New Zealands largest transport and logistics providers.

=== Sorting ===
On 12 October 2022, NZ Post opened a new over 10,000 square metres &quot;Super Depot&quot; in Wellington capable of automatically sorting 11,000 parcels per hour which was previously done by hand. The new automated sorting system uses optical character recognition (OCR) capable of reading hand writing as well as barcode scanning to determine where the package should go. The sorting technology was designed and produced in partnership with Daifuku Oceania.

=== Issue of stamps ===

NZ Post is responsible for deciding on stamp design and stamp production. From 1 April 1998 until 1 April 2003, only New Zealand Post was allowed to issue postage stamps that bear the words &quot;New Zealand,&quot; according to New Zealand law. Each year the Post&#x27;s stamp business unit sets how many stamps it will issue and what the stamps will depict. The Post considers suggestions from New Zealand citizens and people around the world when deciding the subject of stamps. It also works with organisations to create commemorative stamps. For example, in 2014, the Post collaborated with Air New Zealand to issue a stamp for the airline&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

Once a decision on the stamp&#x27;s subject is made, the Post asks at least two designers to draw a sketch, from which the final design is chosen. There are four things each stamp design must include: the stamp&#x27;s denomination, the words New Zealand, a fern, one of the country&#x27;s unofficial symbols, and a description of what the stamp depicts. Finally, the Post uses printers from around the world to print the stamps–it does not print them itself.

New Zealand&#x27;s first stamp was issued by NZ Post&#x27;s predecessor, the Post Office Department of the New Zealand government, in 1855. The stamp depicted Queen Victoria, and was printed in one penny, two pence and one shilling denominations.

<doc id="242042" wikidata="Q154968" url="?curid=242042" title="Lili Marleen">
<text>&quot;Lili Marleen&quot; (also spelled &quot;Lili Marlen&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Lilli Marlene&quot;, &quot;Lily Marlene&quot;, &quot;Lili Marlène&quot; among others; ) is a German love song that became popular during World War II throughout Europe and the Mediterranean among both Axis and Allied troops. Written in 1915 as a poem, the song was published in 1937 and was first recorded by Lale Andersen in 1939 as &quot;Das Mädchen unter der Laterne&quot; (&quot;The Girl under the Lantern&quot;). The song is also well known in a version performed by Marlene Dietrich.

In 2005, Bear Family Records released a 7-CD set &quot;Lili Marleen an allen Fronten&quot; (&quot;Lili Marleen on all Fronts&quot;), including nearly 200 versions of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; with a 180-page booklet.

==Creation==
The words were written in 1915 as a poem of three verses by Hans Leip (1893–1983), a school teacher from Hamburg who had been conscripted into the Imperial German Army. Leip reportedly combined the nickname of his friend&#x27;s girlfriend, Lili, with the name of another friend, Marleen, who was a nurse. The poem was later published in 1937 as &quot;Das Lied eines jungen Soldaten auf der Wacht&quot; (&quot;The Song of a Young Soldier on Watch&quot;), with two further verses added.

It was set to music by Norbert Schultze in 1938 and recorded by Lale Andersen for the first time in 1939. In early 1942, she recorded the song in English, the lyrics translated by Norman Baillie-Stewart, a former British army officer working for German propaganda.

Songwriter Tommie Connor also wrote English lyrics with the title &quot;Lily of the Lamplight&quot; in 1944. Another English translation was done by Theodore Stephanides during World War II and published in his memoir &quot;Climax in Crete&quot; in 1946.

==Exposure and reception==

After the occupation of Belgrade in 1941, Radio Belgrade became the German forces&#x27; radio station under the name of &quot;Soldatensender Belgrad&quot; (Soldiers&#x27; Radio Belgrade), with transmissions heard throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.

While on leave in Vienna, a lieutenant working at the station was asked to collect a pile of second-hand records from the Reich radio station. Among them was &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; sung by Lale Andersen, which up till then had sold around 700 copies. Karl-Heinz Reintgen, the German officer in charge of the station, began playing the song on the air. For lack of other recordings, Radio Belgrade played the song frequently.

The song was published in South Africa, in a wartime leaflet, with an anonymous English translation, as &quot;Lili Marleen: The Theme Song of the Eighth Army and the 6th Armoured Division&quot;.

Lale Andersen was awarded a gold disc for over one million sales (His Master&#x27;s Voice - EG 6993). It is thought she was awarded her copy after hostilities ended. HMV&#x27;s copy was discarded during renovations to their Oxford Street store in the 1960s, but the disc was recovered and is now in a private collection.

Many Allied soldiers made a point of listening to the song at the end of the day. For example, in his memoir &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot;, Fitzroy Maclean describes the song&#x27;s effect in early 1942 during the Western Desert Campaign: &quot;Husky, sensuous, nostalgic, sugar-sweet, her voice seemed to reach out to you, as she lingered over the catchy tune, the sickly sentimental words. Belgrade... The continent of Europe seemed a long way away. I wondered when I would see it again and what it would be like by the time we got there.&quot;

The next year, parachuted into the Yugoslav guerrilla war, Maclean wrote: &quot;Sometimes at night, before going to sleep, we would turn on our receiving set and listen to Radio Belgrade. For months now, the flower of the Afrika Korps had been languishing behind the barbed wire of Allied prison camps. But still, punctually at ten o&#x27;clock, came Lale Andersen singing their special song, with the same unvarying, heart-rending sweetness that we knew so well from the desert. [...] Belgrade was still remote. But, now [...] it had become our ultimate goal, which Lili Marlene and her nostalgic little tune seemed somehow to symbolise.&quot;

In late 1944, the liberation of Belgrade seemed not far away. &quot;Then, at ten o&#x27;clock, loud and clear, Radio Belgrade; Lili Marlene, sweet, insidious, melancholy. &#x27;Not much longer now,&#x27; we would say, as we switched it off.&quot; As the Red Army was advancing on Belgrade, he reflected again on the song. &quot;At Valjevo, as at so many other places [...] we would tune our wireless sets in the evening to Radio Belgrade, and night after night, always at the same time, would come, throbbing lingeringly over the ether, the cheap, sugary and almost painfully nostalgic melody, the sex-laden, intimate, heart-rending accents of Lili Marlene. &#x27;Not gone yet,&#x27; we would say to each other. &#x27;I wonder if we&#x27;ll find her when we get there.&#x27; Then one evening at the accustomed time there was silence. &#x27;Gone away,&#x27; we said.&quot;

Allied soldiers in Italy later adapted the tune to their own lyrics, creating the &quot;D-Day Dodgers&quot; song. A cartoon by Bill Mauldin in the American army newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; shows two soldiers in a foxhole, one playing a harmonica, while the other comments, &quot;The krauts ain&#x27;t following ya too good on &#x27;Lili Marlene&#x27; tonight, Joe. Think somethin&#x27; happened to their tenor?&quot;

==Marlene Dietrich version==
In 1944, the Morale Operations Branch of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) initiated the Muzak Project, musical propaganda broadcasts designed to demoralize enemy soldiers. Marlene Dietrich, the only performer who was told her recordings would be for OSS use, recorded several songs in German for the project, including &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;. Dietrich performed it, as well as many other songs, live in Europe for Allied troops, often on rickety, makeshift stages.

&quot;Lili Marleen&quot; became the theme song on the German language OSS MO radio station &quot;Soldatensender&quot;. After its warm reception by the troops in Europe, the song was re-recorded and released, with the spelling &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; after her name, &quot;Marlene&quot;, with Charles Magnante on the accordion, as the &quot;orchestra director&quot;, with the disk&#x27; B-side, as &quot;Symphonie&quot;, sung in French. It was released by Decca Records in 1945. The original OSS recording of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; remained thus unissued.

In 1961, Dietrich starred in the film &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;, a dramatization of the war trials. In one scene she walks down a rubbled street, ravaged by Allied attacks, with Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character. As they approach a bar they hear men inside singing &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; in German. Dietrich begins to sing along with the song, translating a few lyrics for Tracy, referring to the German lyrics as &quot;much sadder&quot; than the English.
While she was touring the world in live one-woman cabaret shows from 1953 to 1975, the song was part of Dietrich&#x27;s usual line-up, usually following &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;. She always introduced her signature song with some variation of this quote, from a 1960s concert, somewhere in Europe:

Dietrich sang &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; in her television special &quot;An Evening with Marlene Dietrich&quot;, which aired on the BBC in the UK and on CBS in the US in 1973, and was featured on four of her six original albums. She also recorded and performed it in both the original German version and the English adaptation. Both versions have appeared on many compilation albums worldwide, several of them titled after the song.

==Other versions==
The Italian version, translated by lyricist Nino Rastelli and recorded in 1942 by Lina Termini, was probably the first to be released; the earliest English language recording of the song was probably Anne Shelton&#x27;s, but other cover versions followed. A version called &quot;The D-Day Dodgers&quot; with words by Harry Pynn was sung by the allied troops in Italy once the Normandy invasion had begun in 1944. A recording was made by Perry Como on 27 June 1944 and issued by RCA Victor on 78 rpm (catalog number 20-1592-A) with the flip side &quot;First Class Private Mary Brown&quot;. This recording was later re-issued as catalog number 20-2824-A with flip side &quot;I Love You Truly&quot;. The song reached chart position #13 on the United States charts. The song was recorded during the musicians&#x27; strike and consequently has a backing chorus instead of an orchestral backup. A version with French words by Henri Lemarchand was recorded by Suzy Solidor in 1941.
Lilly Hodácová recorded the first version in Czech, shortly before the end of the war. Other artists who recorded the song included Hildegarde (on Decca), Bing Crosby (recorded 30 December 1947), Martha Tilton (on Coral), and Vaughn Monroe (on V-Disc). Al Martino revived the song for Capitol Records in 1968. Another version was recorded in the 1960s by Hank Locklin, Connie Francis and Vera Lynn. A German version of the song also covered by Edith &#x27;Lolita&#x27; Zuser. An instrumental version was also covered by Billy Vaughn. Hank Snow also recorded a version in 1963 on his album &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot;. Another French singer, Patricia Kaas used &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; as an intro for her song &quot;D&#x27;Allemagne&quot; and sang the entire song during concerts in the 1990s. Matia Bazar (Italy) recorded an uptempo beat song called &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; on her 1982 album &quot;Berlino, Parigi, Londra&quot;. The song is a &quot;spoken words&quot; early 1980s dance track. Spanish group Olé Olé, led by Marta Sánchez, released an electro-pop version of the song in 1985. It became one of the best-selling singles in Spain of the 1980s, and paved way for the singer to have a successful career. The song was eventually included in the also best-selling album &quot;Bailando sin salir de casa&quot; in 1986. German blackmetal band Eisregen recorded a version of &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; on their album &quot;Hexenhaus&quot;. The German Gothic metal/Industrial metal band Atrocity released the song in both languages (English &amp; German) on &quot;Gemini&quot;: on the blue edition was the German version, and on the red edition was the English version. Kid Creole and the Coconuts included an uptempo, disco-influenced version of &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;, with German lyrics sung by Coconut Adriana Kaegi, on their 1980 debut LP release &quot;Off the Coast of Me&quot;. Carly Simon recorded the song as the third track on her 1997 Arista CD &quot;Film Noir&quot;. It has also been translated into Hawaiian by Kiope Raymond, and recorded by Raymond and Pearl Rose on Rose&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Homecoming&quot;. Most recently it was recorded by Neil Hannon of the Irish pop group The Divine Comedy as a B-side to the 2006 single &quot;A Lady of a Certain Age&quot;. A slow-tempo instrumental version can be found on the compilation LP, &quot;Vienna: City of Dreams&quot;, by the Austrian zither master Anton Karas. &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; has been adopted as the regimental slow march by the Special Air Service, Special Air Service Regiment and Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, and its melody is the basis of the official march of Kodam III/Siliwangi in the Indonesian Army.

During WWII Soviet counterpropaganda officer (and future dissident) Lev Kopelev wrote a parody of the original song for demoralization of enemy soldiers. The original text (in German) of this parody is lost, but famous Russian poet Joseph Brodsky wrote a poem in Russian, based on this parody. The poem is quite different from the original German song, though many Russians think the Brodsky version is an exact translation.

==Other interpretations==
*It has been sung and marched as &#x27;passacaille&#x27; and slow march by the Military of Chile in its adaptation to the Spanish Language.
*It is also adapted to Indonesian as &quot;March of Siliwangi Division&quot; of the Indonesian Army. It was first sung by the Siliwangi Division while marching from West Java to Yogyakarta as a result of the Renville Agreement with the Dutch Government in February 1948. The song has 2 languages in 1 song, Indonesian and Sundanese (language used by the people of West Java). See following song.
*Humphrey Jennings directed the 29-minute-long film &quot;The True Story of Lili Marlene&quot; in 1944 about the song.
*The song features prominently in &quot;Lili Marlene&quot; (1950), starring Lisa Daniely. The film tells a fictionalised version of the story of the woman (played by Daniely) who purportedly inspired the song.
*The song is sung in a bar in Germany in the 1961 film &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;. In a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich (who recorded the song several times), and Spencer Tracy, Dietrich&#x27;s character explains to Tracy&#x27;s that the German words are much sadder than the English translations.
*The song&#x27;s popularity among both Allied and Axis troops in the Western Desert front during World War Two was described in the British television program &quot;The World at War&quot;, a documentary series broadcast in 1973–74 and narrated by Laurence Olivier, in Episode 8, &quot;The Desert: North Africa 1940–1943&quot;.
*Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed the 1980 film &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;, the story of Lale Andersen and her version of the song.
*In 1981 Matia Bazar inserted a cover of Lili Marleen, in the original German language, on their album &quot;Berlino, Parigi, Londra&quot; (Side A - track 1).
*The song is featured prominently in a scene of a 1983 Yugoslavian film &quot;Balkan Express&quot; set during World War II. In the scene, a bar singer (portrayed by popular folk singer Toma Zdravković) refuses to sing the song to some German soldiers who then escort him out of the bar. Later in the scene, he returns to the stage and is depicted singing the song with blood on his face, implying he had been persuaded into singing by beating.
*Estonian punk rock band Vennaskond released an Estonian version of the song on their album &quot;Usk. Lootus. Armastus.&quot; in 1993. Another Estonian group, Swing Swindlers, recorded a melancholy swinging version in 2007 (both in German and Estonian) and featured the song in their film &quot;Berlin 1945: Musik Unter Bomben&quot; with vocals by Mart Sander, Kelli Uustani, Nele-Liis Vaiksoo, and Pirjo Levandi.
*The 2009 film &quot;Bad Day to Go Fishing&quot;, directed by Alvaro Brechner, showed an uncontrollable titan (Jouko Ahola) who could only be appeased by the melody of &quot;Lili Marlene&quot;.
*Dutch folk band Omnia recorded a version of the song on their 2011 album &quot;Musick and Poëtree&quot;.
*The song appears in the prelude scene of the 2023 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, where it is sung by a group of German soldiers having supper.

<text>Antônio Carlos Gomes (; 11 July 1836 in Campinas – 16 September 1896 in Belém) was a Brazilian composer notable for being the first New World composer whose work was accepted by Europe. He was the only non-European who was successful as an opera composer in Italy, during the &quot;golden age of opera&quot;, contemporary to Verdi and Puccini and the first composer of non-European lineage to be accepted into the Classic tradition of music.

Younger than Verdi, yet older than Puccini, Carlos Gomes achieved his first major success in a time when the Italian audiences were eager for a new name to celebrate and Puccini had not yet officially started his career. After the successful premiere of &quot;Il Guarany&quot;, Gomes was considered the most promising new composer. Verdi said his work was an expression of &quot;true musical genius&quot;. Liszt said that “it displays dense technical maturity, full of harmonic and orchestral maturity.” 

==Life==
He was born on 11 July 1836 in Campinas, São Paulo Province, son of Maestro Manuel José Gomes and Fabiana Maria Jaguari Cardoso.

His childhood&#x27;s musical tendencies were soon stimulated by his father and by his older brother, José Pedro de Sant&#x27;Ana Gomes, also a conductor. José Pedro was the most dedicated guide and adviser in his brother&#x27;s artistic career. He convinced Antônio to visit the Court where he became a protégé of Emperor Dom Pedro II, who, being notoriously interested in the careers of Brazilian artists and intellectuals, made it possible for Antônio Carlos to study at the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro.

After having graduated with honours, Carlos produced his first opera, &quot;A noite do castelo&quot; (September 1861), which was a big success. Two years later, he repeated it with his second opera, &quot;Joana de Flandres&quot;, which was considered superior to the first. These two pieces convinced the Emperor to offer him a Royal scholarship to study in Italy in 1864. He studied in Milan at the local conservatory with Lauro Rossi and Alberto Mazzucato and completed in three years a course which was normally completed in four years, obtaining the title of Maestro Composer.

Interested in composing an opera which dealt with a truly Brazilian subject, Carlos Gomes chose as the theme of his next work the romance novel &quot;O Guarani&quot;, by Brazilian writer José de Alencar. The opera was given an Indian subject and setting and it premiered in May 1870 at the La Scala Theater in Milan as &quot;Il Guarany&quot;.

The success was enormous. Even the most strict musical critics compared the Brazilian musician to the great European maestros, such as Rossini and Verdi. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel II, decorated the creator of the opera, which was presented in all major European capitals. Before that year was over, Gomes returned to Brazil, where he organized the premiere of &quot;Il Guarany&quot; in Rio de Janeiro. The piece achieved the same success Gomes had seen in Italy.

Returning to Italy, Carlos Gomes married Adelina Peri, an Italian pianist he had met while studying in Milan.

He wrote the hymn &quot;Il saluto del Brasile&quot; for the centenary of American independence which was performed in Philadelphia, on July 19, 1876.

In 1883 the maestro traveled to Brazil, receiving homages in every city he visited. When he returned to Italy, he dedicated himself to the composition of an opera themed against slavery, inspired by the liberation struggle of black slaves in Brazil, which got the title of &quot;Lo schiavo&quot;. The composition, which had been suggested by a great friend of Antônio&#x27;s, a black engineer named André Rebouças, only debuted several years later in 1889.

When the Brazilian republic was proclaimed in 1889, Carlos Gomes, who at this time was in Campinas, sailed once more to Italy. Faithful to the Brazilian monarchy and Dom Pedro II, Gomes refused the opportunity given to him by president Deodoro da Fonseca to compose the new Brazilian National Anthem. In the following years, he composed the opera &quot;Condor&quot; and the cantata &quot;Colombo&quot;, for the Columbus Festival (12 October 1892), in celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America.

Invited by the governor of the Brazilian province of Pará to direct the Musical Conservatory, the maestro traveled to the capital Belém, willing to take the position. However, shortly after arriving, Carlos Gomes, by then an elderly man in poor health, died at 22:20 BRT on 16 September 1896. Besides his eight operas, he composed songs (3 books), choruses, and piano pieces.

<doc id="242046" wikidata="Q178994" url="?curid=242046" title="Australian Antarctic Territory">
<text>The Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT) is a part of East Antarctica claimed by Australia as an external territory. It is administered by the Australian Antarctic Division, an agency of the federal Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water. The territory&#x27;s history dates to a claim on Enderby Land made by the United Kingdom in 1841, which was subsequently expanded and eventually transferred to Australia in 1933. It is the largest sector of Antarctica claimed by any by area. Australia is an original signatory to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. Under Article IV, all territorial claims are held in abeyance. Only four other countries accept Australia&#x27;s claim to sovereignty, being New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France and Norway, all of which have territorial claims in Antarctica and mutually accept each other’s claims.

==Area==
The AAT consists of all the islands and territory south of 60°S and between 44°38′E and 160°E, except for Adélie Land (136°E to 142°E), which divides the territory into Western AAT (the larger portion) and Eastern AAT. It is bounded by Queen Maud Land in the West and by the Ross Dependency in the East. The Australian Antarctic Territory is the largest of any claims to the continent, and covers nearly 5.9 million square kilometres. This makes up about 42% of Antarctica, and would cover about 80% of Mainland Australia. It also corresponds to roughly twice the size of Queen Maud Land, India, Argentina or Kazakhstan.

The territory is mostly inhabited by the staff of research stations. The Australian Antarctic Division administers the area primarily by maintaining three year-round stations—Mawson, Davis, and Casey—which support various research projects.

==Subdivisions==

The territory is divided into nine districts, which are from west to east:
These regions are split into two separate areas geographically, with George V Land and Oates Land lying to the east of the French Territorial claim of Adélie Land, and all other districts lying to its west.

==Exclusive economic zone==
Australia claims an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from the Australian Antarctic Territory. However, the Australian proclamation of an Antarctic EEZ is contested. The effect of Article IV of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty (which prohibits new territorial claims or the extension of existing claims in the Antarctic) would seem to be that an EEZ cannot be claimed in relation to territory to which that Treaty applies (south of 60° South). The provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) define the exclusive economic zone of a coastal state as up to from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured.

===Whaling===
Whaling in Australian Antarctic territorial waters is controversial and has received international attention. Anti-whaling protest groups, in particular Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, have been active within the Australian Antarctic territorial waters. Sea Shepherd small boat crews have had multiple encounters with Japanese ships that claim to be on research expeditions while opponents argue this is only a &quot;cover&quot; for banned commercial whaling. The Australian Whale Sanctuary, in Australian Antarctic territory, is not recognised by the government of Japan. Anti-whaling legislation passed by the Australian Government applies to Australian territorial waters. However, Australia&#x27;s claims of sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory—and thus sovereignty over Australian Antarctic territorial waters—are recognised by only the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway.

==Stations==

Active and closed stations in the territory, from West to East:


==History==
In 1933, a British imperial order stated: That part of His Majesty&#x27;s dominions in the Antarctic Seas which comprises all the islands and territories other than Adélie Land which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude and lying between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 45th degree of East Longitude is hereby placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia.
In 1933, the Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act 1933 stated: That part of the territory in the Antarctic seas which comprises all the islands and territories, other than Adelie Land, situated south of the 60th degree south latitude and lying between the 160th degree east longitude and the 45th degree east longitude, is hereby declared to be accepted by the Commonwealth as a Territory under the authority of the Commonwealth, by the name of the Australian Antarctic Territory.

The borders with Adélie Land were fixed definitively in 1938. In 1947, Britain transferred Heard Island and McDonald Islands to the territory. On 13 February 1954, Mawson Station was established as the first Australian station on the continent proper.

==Recognition and promotion of Australian sovereignty==
Australia&#x27;s claim to sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory is recognised by only the United Kingdom, New Zealand, France and Norway. Ships of Japan conduct whaling in Australian Antarctic territorial waters.

In 2016, the Australian Government formulated an Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year &quot;Action Plan&quot; to improve overland transport capabilities and aviation access to the continent. The plan incorporated a strategy to protect the Antarctic environment and maintain an indefinite ban on mining and oil drilling. The construction of a research and resupply icebreaker vessel was also planned. The 25,000-tonne was delivered in 2021 and was immediately employed in support of the Casey Station. It is envisaged that the ship will support scientific research over the next 30 years.

Through &quot;Operation Southern Discovery&quot;, elements of the Australian Defence Force also provide annual support for the Australian Antarctic Division and the Australian Antarctic Program (AAP) in regional scientific, environmental and economic activities. The Royal Australian Air Force provides air logistical support using C-17 transport aircraft supported by KC-30 tanker aircraft to supply Wilkins airfield in Antarctica.

==Mining in Antarctica==
During the early 1980s, there was a brief debate in Australia on whether or not to allow mining on the mineral-rich continent. Several mining proposals have been discussed and have all been rejected.

On 9 August 2011, the influential Australian think-tank, the Lowy Institute, published a report warning Canberra against complacency when it comes to its claim. The global treaty banning resource exploitation becomes reviewable in 2041, and some states may then decide to withdraw from it considering the continent&#x27;s mineral deposits. These include coal seams, manganese, iron and uranium, while Antarctica&#x27;s forecast oil reserves are estimated as among the largest in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Lowy&#x27;s national security fellow Ellie Fogarty said in the paper that Australia cannot adequately patrol its claim, lacking the kind of ski-planes it needs to reach some areas.

==Postage stamps==

Australia issues postage stamps for the Australian Antarctic Territory. The first issues came in 1957, and sporadically thereafter, settling into a pattern of an annual issue by the 1990s. All have been Antarctic-themed, and all are valid for postage in Australia and its territories, including Antarctica.

==Telephone connections==
Assigned the country calling code +672 1[0-4] XXXX, the four stations and the Aurora Australis operated by the Australian Antarctic Division can be reached by direct calling from anywhere in the world. The area codes are 10 for Davis, 11 for Mawson, 12 for Casey, 13 for Macquarie Island and 14 for Wilkins and the Aurora Australis, in each case followed by four additional digits.

==People==
As of May 2018, the AAT was believed to have a population of around 80 people during winters and 200 during summers.

<text>Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG (JFM, earlier JCO or JKO in World War I, English: Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works) more commonly Junkers , was a major German aircraft and aircraft engine manufacturer. It was founded in Dessau, Germany, in 1895 by Hugo Junkers, initially manufacturing boilers and radiators. During World War I and following the war, the company became famous for its pioneering all-metal aircraft. During World War II the company produced the German air force&#x27;s planes, as well as piston and jet aircraft engines, albeit in the absence of its founder who had been removed by the Nazis in 1934.

==History==


===Early inter-war period===
In the immediate post-war era, Junkers used their J8 layout as the basis for the F-13, first flown on 25 June 1919 and certified airworthy in July of the same year. This four passenger monoplane was the world&#x27;s first all-metal airliner. Of note, in addition to significant European sales, some twenty-five of these airplanes were delivered to North American customers under the Junkers-Larsen affiliate and were used primarily as airmail planes.

The Treaty of Versailles, signed only days after the F-13 flew, initially forbade any aircraft construction in Germany for several months. After that span of time, only the design of civilian aircraft was permitted to Germany. With a partial relocation of the Junkers firm to the Fili western suburb of Moscow, the Junkers firm was able to restart its aircraft manufacturing concern within the borders of the Soviet Union in 1922, the partly revitalized Junkers firm developed a series of progressively larger civil aircraft including the single-engined G.24 and three-engine G.31. Neither aircraft was a commercial success. With the expiration of treaty restrictions in 1926, Junkers introduced the Junkers W33 and Junkers W34 series, which did find significant commercial success via large production orders in passenger, freight hauling, and, somewhat later, military configurations. The W-33/W-34 series also set multiple aviation &quot;firsts&quot; including records for flight duration, flight distance, altitude, rocket-assisted take-off and inflight refueling between 1926 and 1930.

After previous study work, Junkers set up the &quot;Junkers Luftbild-Zentrale&quot; in Dessau in 1924 to produce aerial photographs for various purposes. Eight years later, due to the financial difficulties of the parent company, this branch was separated and continued to operate as &quot;Bild-Flug&quot; for a year until it was taken over by its main competitor, &quot;Hansa Luftbild&quot;.

Junkers&#x27; produced a design study in 1924 for a visit to the United States. The study outlined a four-engined 80-passenger plane, incorporating a forward canard wing, as well as a main wing, both of which were fitted above twin pylons. Called the Junkers J.1000 Super Duck passenger seating was to be provided both in the main wing and the hull sections of the craft. This Junkers design, including a scale model, was intended to illustrate an aircraft capable of trans-Atlantic operations of 8 to 10 hours and was completely revolutionary for its day.

It was in 1922 that American engineer William Bushnell Stout, and in 1924 that Soviet engineer Andrei Tupolev each adapted the Junkers corrugated duralumin airframe design technologies for their own initial examples of all-metal aircraft in their respective nations – for Stout, the Stout ST twin-engined naval torpedo bomber prototype aircraft, and for Tupolev, the Tupolev ANT-2 small passenger aircraft, who had the assistance of the Soviet government&#x27;s TsAGI research center in achieving success with light-weight metal airframes.

The basic principles outlined in this design were later introduced in the Junkers G.38, which was introduced and put into regular service by Deutsche Luft Hansa. At the time of its introduction, this four-engined transport was the largest landplane in the world carrying thirty-four passengers and seven crew members. The G.38 sat some of its passengers in the wing area outboard of the fuselage, the front of which was covered with windows.

Also, in 1932, Junkers joint project with Maybach designed and built an aerodynamic car but found due to the depression that the market for high end luxury cars was saturated.

===Financial troubles===
Around 1931 the company suffered from a series of financial difficulties that led to the collapse of the group of companies. The existing shareholders pressured Hugo to leave the company. Hugo, however, was the patent holder on a wide variety of the technologies used in most of the existing Junkers designs, including many of their engines.

A plan was started to solve both problems by &quot;buying out&quot; Hugo&#x27;s engine patent portfolio and placing it into the hands of a new company, the Junkers Motoren-Patentstelle GmbH, which was eventually formed in November 1932. The new company would then license the technologies back to the various companies, most notably what was then Junkers Motorenbau (one of many &quot;Jumo&quot; companies). However, before Junkers actually transferred his patents to the Patentstelle, the collapse of the Junkers consortium was solved by the sale of Junkers Thermo Technik GmbH to Robert Bosch GmbH, whose company still uses the brand name. Adolf Dethmann, a Communist activist and friend of Hugo, was appointed managing director.

===Post World War II===
The Junkers company survived the Second World War and the formation of East Germany, and was reconstituted as Junkers GmbH and eventually merged into the MBB consortium (via joint venture Flugzeug-Union-Süd between Heinkel and Messerschmitt in 1958). Messerschmitt ended the joint venture in 1965 by acquiring control of JFM AG and absorbing it within Messerschmitt in 1967. Within West Germany, Junkers GmbH was engaged in research on the future of aerospace transportation during the fifties and early-1960s. During this period, Junkers employed the famous Austrian engineer and space travel theorist, Eugen Sänger, who in 1961 completed work for the design of an advanced orbital spacecraft at Junkers. Junkers GmbH was absorbed within MBB and the Junkers name disappeared in 1969.

==Products==
===Aircraft===

The Junkers firm&#x27;s early aircraft were identified by the letter J for Junkers followed by an Arabic type number. From 1919 they introduced an additional sales designation using the same number but prefixed by a letter indicating the role of the aircraft:
:A = Austauschflugzeug (suitable for either civil or military use)
:EF = Entwurfsflugzeug (experimental aircraft)
:F = Flugzeug (aircraft)
:G = Großflugzeug (large aircraft)
:H = aircraft built at Junkers&#x27; Moscow plant
:K = Kampfflugzeug (bomber)
:S = Spezial (special)
:T = Schulflugzeug (trainer aircraft)
:W = Wasserflugzeug (seaplane).

Just once, the same number was used to identify two different completed types. This pair was the T 23 and G23, both also known as J 23.

During World War I, machines in service used the regular Idflieg aircraft designation system to specify their design&#x27;s purpose, also promoted by the Flugzeugmeisterei (Air Ministry), again a letter number system indicating role:
:CL = two-seat ground attack
:D = single-seat biplane scout, by 1918 used for all single seat scouts.
:E = single-seat monoplane scout
:J = two-seat armoured close support biplane.

The best known and most confusing example is the Junkers J 4 armored-fuselage, all-metal sesquiplane, known to the military as the Junkers J.I.

The single letter company prefix was not replaced by the twin-letter Ju prefix until 1933. This RLM system – from the Third Reich&#x27;s air ministry – applied to all German manufacturers; the first Junkers aircraft to receive a Ju number was the W 33, so retrospectively it became the Ju 33. However, earlier aircraft built in Moscow like the H 21 were often described by a Ju number, e.g. Ju 21.

===Aircraft engines===

All Junkers diesel engines were two stroke, opposed piston designs, an arrangement he invented in the early 1890s. It was intended to provide an alternative to Nicholaus Otto&#x27;s patented four stroke which would run on low grade fuels such as blast furnace waste gases. By 1896 Junkers engines were generating electrical power in steelworks.

<doc id="242053" wikidata="Q234598" url="?curid=242053" title="Hikaru Utada">
<text>, also known mononymously as Utada, is a Japanese and American singer, songwriter, and producer. She is considered to be one of the most influential and best-selling musical artists in Japan.

Utada was born in New York City to Japanese parents, record producer Teruzane Utada and singer Keiko Fuji. She began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to Tokyo as a result of her father&#x27;s job. After signing to Toshiba-EMI, she released her debut English-language debut album &quot;Precious&quot; under the name Cubic U in 1998, which was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&amp;B and dance-pop, Utada released her Japanese-language debut, &quot;First Love&quot;, which was an immediate success. Backed by the success of singles &quot;Automatic&quot;, &quot;Time Will Tell&quot;, and &quot;Movin&#x27; On Without You&quot;, the album sold two million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the Oricon charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six million more throughout the rest of 1999. &quot;First Love&quot; eventually became Japan&#x27;s best-selling album of all time.

Utada&#x27;s album &quot;Distance&quot; was released in early 2001 and spawned her biggest singles—&quot;Addicted to You&quot;, &quot;Wait &amp; See (Risk)&quot; and &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot;—which became million-sellers. The album broke several sales records after three million copies were sold in its first week, instantly becoming Japan&#x27;s fastest-selling album. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as Traveling, Hikari and Sakura Drops, &quot;Deep River&quot;, which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and became one of Japan&#x27;s top-selling records of all time. The albums &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;Ultra Blue&quot; and &quot;Heart Station&quot; also sold millions of copies. After a prolonged hiatus, Utada released the acoustic-driven albums &quot;Fantôme&quot; (2016) and &quot;Hatsukoi&quot; (2018), which reached number one on the Oricon albums chart. She topped the charts again with 2022&#x27;s &quot;Bad Mode&quot;, her first Japanese/English album.

By the end of the 2000s, Utada was deemed &quot;the most influential artist of the decade&quot; in the Japanese music landscape by &quot;The Japan Times&quot;. She is one of Japan&#x27;s top-selling recording artists of all time with over 40 million records sold. Twelve of her singles have reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, while ten albums have become chart-toppers. Six of her full-length releases are among Japan&#x27;s highest-selling albums, including &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;Distance&quot; and &quot;Deep River&quot;, which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan&#x27;s music history. She is best known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-song contributions to Square Enix and Disney&#x27;s collaborative video game series &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;: &quot;Simple and Clean&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice&quot;, and &quot;Face My Fears&quot;. In 2021, Utada became one of the first Japanese figures to identify as non-binary.

== Biography ==

===Early life and beginnings===

Hikaru Utada was born on January 19, 1983 in New York City to Japanese parents. Her mother Keiko Fuji was an singer, while her father Teruzane Utada is a record producer. She grew up in Upper East Side, New York and moved to Tokyo, Japan at age 11 due to her parents work. At the age of 10, Utada began to write music and lyrics. Utada attended Columbia University in New York City starting in 2001. but dropped out after less than a year. 

Utada made recordings with her mother, releasing songs under a band named &quot;U3.&quot; In 1996 she started a solo project under the name Cubic U. The first Cubic U single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Stronger&quot;, was released as a limited pressing in Japan in 1996. The next year, Utada started another project, releasing &quot;Close to You&quot;, a cover of the Carpenters&#x27; song. She included it on her debut album &quot;Precious&quot; the following year. Both the album and single failed to chart on Oricon in Japan.

===1998–2003: Japanese debut, &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;Distance&quot;, and &quot;Deep River&quot;===
Utada moved to Tokyo in the summer of 1998 and attended Seisen International School, and later the American School in Japan, while continuing to record on a contract with Toshiba-EMI. Early success came from Japanese FM radio. She was at the forefront of a new wave of singer-songwriters in Japan, branching out from the previously dominant idol singers. Leading up to the release of her Japanese debut album &quot;First Love&quot;, at the age of 15, she released two successful million-selling singles: &quot;Movin&#x27; On Without You&quot; and &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell&quot; and. The latter sold over two million copies. Backed by these singles, &quot;First Love&quot; went on to sell over 7 million units in Japan alone (with an additional 3 million overseas, bringing it to a sum of at least 10 million units), becoming the highest selling album in Japan&#x27;s recent history. The album yielded the single &quot;First Love&quot;, which peaked at the number 2 spot. By the end of the year, Utada was ranked 5th on Japanese radio station Tokio Hot 100 Airplay&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Artists of the 20th Century&quot; by the station and its listeners.

After a two-year break, Utada released the follow-up album &quot;Distance&quot;, garnering first-week sales of 3 million units. On the strength of its singles — &quot;Addicted to You&quot;, &quot;Wait &amp; See (Risk)&quot;, &quot;For You&quot;, &quot;Time Limit&quot;, and &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; — &quot;Distance&quot; became the best-selling album of the year, with 4.47 million copies sold in Japan alone. Additionally, &quot;Addicted to You&quot; became her best-selling single, moving a million copies in its first week, the highest first week sales for a female solo artist, and staying on top of the chart for two consecutive weeks. &quot;Wait &amp; See: Risk&quot; and &quot;Can You Keep a Secret?&quot; also were later ranked at number 6 and number 10 respectively on Oricon&#x27;s list of 10 Best-Selling Singles from January 1, 1999, to April 24, 2006. Utada also went on to release a single, titled &quot;Final Distance&quot;, which was dedicated to the female victim of a murder case in Ikeda, Osaka.

In 2001, Utada recorded the song &quot;Blow My Whistle&quot; The song was included on the soundtrack for the 2001 American action comedy film &quot;Rush Hour 2,&quot; which peaked the 11th spot on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 1 on the Top Soundtracks. The song was a collaboration with American rapper Foxy Brown, and was written by Utada alongside producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. 

Leading up to the third album, &quot;Deep River&quot;, Utada released &quot;Traveling&quot;, &quot;Hikari&quot;, and &quot;Sakura Drops/Letters&quot;; all the songs reached the top of the charts. &quot;Deep River&quot; sold 2.35 million copies in its first week. Oricon reported that sales eventually surpassed 3.6 million, making Utada the only singer or group in Japanese music history to have three consecutive albums surpass the three-million mark, by RIAJ standards. It was her third consecutive album to reach number 1 on Oricon&#x27;s Yearly Albums chart and became the eighth best selling album of all time in Japan. In 2003, Utada&#x27;s promotional and personal life schedules became more active due to her marriage and an agreement with Island Records in the United States to release a &quot;proper&quot; full-English debut album. &quot;Colors&quot; was her only single release for 2003.

===2004–2005: Foray into international market, and &quot;Exodus&quot;===

Utada&#x27;s first singles compilation album &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1&quot; was released on March 31, 2004. It became the best-selling album of 2004 in Japan, making her the only solo or group artist to reach number 1 four times on the yearly charts. It was the first compilation album to reach number 1 in six years on the yearly charts, and the first compilation album to reach number 1 in twenty-six years by a female artist. Despite its success, the album received little promotion and no new material; moreover, it charted longer on the Oricon Albums chart than any other Utada release to date (over two years). The album sold 2.58 million units in Japan, making it the 34th best-selling album ever in the country. A month later, on April 21, she released a lone Japanese single for 2004, &quot;Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro&quot;, which topped the singles chart for two consecutive weeks and sold 365,000 units by the year&#x27;s end. It was also the main theme song for &quot;Casshern&quot;, directed by her husband at the time, Kazuaki Kiriya.

In mid-2004, Utada moved back to New York, and began work on a recording contract with Island Def Jam Music Group. On October 5, 2004, she released a North American English-language debut album, &quot;Exodus&quot;, under the newly announced stage name &quot;Utada&quot;. It was released on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an MTV interview, she expressed skepticism about this American success: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the music that I&#x27;m concerned about. It&#x27;s obviously that I look really different and there really aren&#x27;t any completely Asian people [who are popular singers in the U.S.] right now.&quot; She also remarked on the album not being one that pandered to fans, but wanting to make it anyway. &quot;Exodus&quot; became her fourth consecutive release to debut at number 1 and boasted 500,000 copies in its first-week sales in Japan. American sales were not quite as successful: it reached number 160 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart; and peaked at number 5 in the Heatseekers chart. &quot;Easy Breezy&quot; was released as the lead single in early August 2004, followed up by &quot;Devil Inside&quot; six weeks later. Utada appeared on the cover of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine&#x27;s June 2005 issue.

&quot;Exodus &#x27;04&quot; was released at the end of June 2005 and featured remixes from the Scumfrog, Richard Vission, JJ Flores and Peter Bailey. In the UK, Mercury added another two remixes for &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot; in the original album, titled &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Bloodshy &amp; Avant Mix)&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Junior Jack Mix)&quot;. By the end of the year, Utada was voted &quot;Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2004&quot; by Oricon&#x27;s annual readers poll. The fourth single from &quot;Exodus&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot;, was released in October 2005 in the UK. &quot;Devil Inside&quot; became a club hit in the U.S. and topped the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Airplay charts. Both the &quot;Exodus&quot; album and the &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot; single were released in the UK, with different artwork from the US and Japanese versions.

===2005–2008: Return to Japan, &quot;Ultra Blue&quot;, and &quot;Heart Station&quot;===
A year after the release of &quot;Exodus&quot;, Utada moved back to Tokyo and returned to the Japanese music scene. Leading up the release of a fourth album, &quot;Ultra Blue&quot;, she released a string of successful hit singles: &quot;Colors&quot; (number 1), &quot;Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro&quot; (number 1), &quot;Be My Last&quot; (number 1), &quot;Passion&quot; (number 4), and &quot;Keep Tryin&#x27;&quot; (number 2). The digital single &quot;This Is Love&quot; was released to promote the album, netting 1,000,000 downloads. &quot;Ultra Blue&quot; sold 500,317 copies in the first week, lower than that of the previous album, although it still topped the Oricon Daily, Weekly, and Monthly charts. &quot;Ultra Blue&quot; was Utada&#x27;s fifth consecutive chart-topping Japanese album (excluding the English-language &quot;Exodus&quot;) to sell in excess of 500,000 copies in the first week. On July 13, Toshiba EMI published a report stating that &quot;Ultra Blue&quot; had sold over one million copies worldwide and four million digital ringtones already making it one of EMI&#x27;s 10 best-selling albums of the past year. The album, which did not contain much pop music, was met with mixed reception, although the album was certified Million by RIAJ. Additionally, it was the highest-selling original studio album by a Japanese female artist in 2006. &quot;Ultra Blue&quot; later became available on the iTunes Japan online music store, charting at number 4 on the 2006 yearly download rankings. Two weeks after the release of &quot;Ultra Blue,&quot; she went on a nationwide tour titled Utada United 2006, from June 30 through September 12. This was her second concert tour after the Bohemian Summer 2000 tour.
The singles that were released prior to Utada&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Heart Station&quot;, were able to reach the Top Five position on the chart, including the number 1 hit &quot;Flavor of Life&quot;, which would become the best selling digital single in Japan with over 7,500,000 copies downloaded. Around the same time, she visited New York to talk with producers and executives at Island/Def Jam about recording a second English album. Later in the year a digital track by American R&amp;B artist Ne-Yo, titled &quot;Do You&quot; from his 2007 album &quot;Because of You&quot;, featured Utada and was released in Japan on November 21 (the song was later featured on Ne-Yo&#x27;s &quot;best of&quot; album, Ne-Yo: The Collection, released on September 2, 2009, in Japan and November 2009 in the US).

On June 30, 2007, the British EMI Group, which had held a 55% stake in Toshiba EMI since before Utada&#x27;s debut in Japan, purchased the remaining 45% stake from the Japanese Toshiba Corporation, therefore making Toshiba EMI a wholly owned subsidiary of the London-based record label. Toshiba EMI then changed its name to EMI Music Japan to reflect Toshiba&#x27;s divestiture from the business. Utada&#x27;s first single under the label, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;/&quot;Kiss &amp; Cry&quot; was released as a double A-side single on August 29, 2007, and also reached number 1 on the Oricon Daily Chart. &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was used as the theme song for &quot;Evangelion 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone&quot;, the 2007 film reboot of the anime, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, while &quot;Kiss &amp; Cry&quot; was used in a series of commercials for Nissin Foods&#x27; Freedom Project advertising campaign starting April 20, 2007, and was previously released as a digital download on May 31, 2007. The year 2007 ended with the single &quot;Flavor of Life&quot; becoming the best seller of 2007 and with Utada again voted &quot;Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2007&quot; by Oricon&#x27;s annual readers poll, after a two-year absence from the top spot. She sold 12 million digital ringtones and songs in 2007, with &quot;Flavor of Life&quot; accounting for 7.5 million, the second-highest of any song worldwide that year. The single was featured as the main song in the second season of TV drama &quot;Hana yori Dango Returns&quot;.

Utada&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Heart Station&quot;, was released on March 19, 2008, becoming her fifth consecutive number-one Japanese studio album. Although it had collected the lowest first week sales for her career, with 480,081 copies sold, the sales of this album reached a million on the Oricon charts in January 2009, making it her first Japanese album to do so since the 2004 compilation album. It was given a certification of one million for shipments by the RIAJ. &quot;Heart Station&quot; became the best-selling digital-format album on the iTunes 2008 yearly album charts in Japan, and was also the highest-selling original studio album by a solo female artist on the Oricon Yearly Chart. The song &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; was used as the theme-song for the television drama &quot;Last Friends&quot;. Although &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot; was not initially released as a single alone, it reached number 1 in iTunes and the Chako-Uta charts after it was released as a single for the drama. It reached number 2 at the Oricon Weekly charts. It marked the fourth successful drama tie-in for Utada, following 1999&#x27;s &quot;Majo no Jōken&quot; and &quot;First Love&quot;, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hana Yori Dango&quot; and &quot;Flavor of Life&quot;. On October 20, 2008, the song &quot;Eternally&quot; from Utada&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Distance&quot; was used as the theme for the drama &quot;Innocent Love&quot;. The song was later released as a digital single. By the end of the year, Utada was also voted the &quot;Number 1 Favorite Artist of 2008&quot; by Oricon&#x27;s annual readers poll for the second consecutive year, and third time overall.

===2009–2010: Return to the US, and &quot;This Is the One&quot;===

On December 16, 2008, information leaked onto the internet that Utada&#x27;s next English-language single, titled &quot;Come Back to Me&quot;, would be scheduled for airplay release through U.S. Rhythmic/Crossover and Mainstream formats on February 9 and 10, 2009 respectively via Island Records. Her second English album, titled &quot;This Is the One&quot;, was released on March 14, 2009, in Japan and on May 12, 2009, in the United States. &quot;This Is the One&quot; debuted at number 1 in Japan on March 13, 2009, the day it was released in Japan, but became her first album not to top the weekly chart since &quot;Precious&quot;. On March 30, 2009, Utada appeared on New York City radio station Z-100, the largest pop radio program in the U.S., and granted a live on-air interview on the station&#x27;s &quot;Elvis Duran Morning Show&quot;, a breakthrough that would lead to a promotional schedule through the album&#x27;s international physical release on May 12. She also sang the theme song for the second &quot;Evangelion&quot; film, &quot;&quot;. The single was released on June 27, 2009, and is a remix of a previous single, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;. The single is titled &quot;Beautiful World -PLANiTb Acoustica Mix-&quot;.

On November 30, 2009, at Studio Coast, Tokyo, Utada sung a duet of &quot;Let It Snow&quot; with pop singer Mika. On December 21, 2009, Utada&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Desire&quot; remixes were released only on Amazon.com, Zune Marketplace, and the U.S. iTunes Store, in support of &quot;This Is the One&quot; and an upcoming tour. The tour, , was her first concert tour outside Japan and included eight cities in the US and two dates in London, UK. The tickets for the second London performance went on public sale November 13, and reportedly sold out in just five hours.

===2010–2015: Second return to Japan, &quot;Single Collection Vol. 2&quot;, &quot;Wild Life&quot;, and hiatus===
In a personal blog post on August 9, 2010, Utada announced a long hiatus, writing &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it will be 2 years or 5 years.&quot; After having been focused on music from age 15 to 27, she expressed a need to have a broader range of experiences, and grow as a person. However, she also wrote that before the hiatus began, some new music would be released. Soon after the post, a compilation album was announced: &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2&quot;, with a release date of November 24, 2010. This album would include all of Utada&#x27;s Japanese singles, from &quot;Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro&quot; to &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, on disc one, as well as an extra EP featuring five new tracks. Later it was announced a DVD containing the promotional video for &quot;Goodbye Happiness&quot; would be included in all first-press edition pre-orders.

On September 27, 2010, Utada revealed a single, entitled &quot;Hymne à l&#x27;amour (Ai no Anthem)&quot;, which became a commercial tie-in for Pepsi NEX. The song features both Japanese and French lyrics, written and translated by Utada herself. She performed a concert series titled Wild Life at Yokohama Arena to promote the album, her first Japanese concert since 2006&#x27;s Utada United. On October 3, 2010, Utada&#x27;s official EMI website was updated with the album artwork and final track list for &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2&quot;. First-press editions included a three-fold paper slip case, along with a good luck charm, and a lottery slip for fans to have a chance at winning one of 1000 tickets to Wild Life. In late October, it was revealed online at Tower Records Japan and several other websites that an English-language &quot;best-of album&quot; titled &quot;Utada the Best&quot;&quot; would become available in Japan on the same day as &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2&quot;, November 24. Utada reacted to the news, stating: &quot;I understand that if it doesn&#x27;t sell, I&#x27;m the one who will take the hit, but to be honest, I don&#x27;t want my fans putting down money for something that my heart isn&#x27;t in.&quot; and &quot;The release of &quot;Utada the Best&quot; is entirely against my will. I wish that my fans won&#x27;t have to buy it. There&#x27;s no new material in it.&quot; 

Utada later announced a single, &quot;Goodbye Happiness&quot;, with its accompanying PV appearing publicly on November 9, 2010. The song was also chosen as the Recochoku Chaku-Uta TV commercial theme song. She also appeared on a track entitled &quot;London City&quot; with English rapper Devlin on his first studio album, &quot;Bud, Sweat and Beers&quot;, which was also released on November 1. On November 8, 2010, EMI Japan announced on its Web site that the company had made a global recording deal with Utada, also stating that all of her future work regardless of language would be released under one name: Hikaru Utada. This signaled the retirement of her Western stage name, Utada. First-week sales for &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 2&quot; were 231,000 units according to Oricon. The release marked Utada&#x27;s seventh consecutive number 1 album (5 original and two best-ofs) since her debut, surpassing KinKi Kids&#x27; previous record of six. On April 10, 2011, she won the award for &quot;Best Conceptual Video&quot; in the Space Shower Music Video Awards for the promotional video for &quot;Goodbye Happiness&quot;, which was also her directorial debut. The two-concert Wild Life tour took place on December 8 and 9, 2010 at Yokohama Arena. The opening concert was broadcast in 64 cinemas in Japan while it was simultaneously broadcast on Ustream, a live video streaming website. The two channels set up for the concert on Ustream were accessed a total of 925,000 times, with 345,000 unique viewers, which was a global record on Ustream.tv for the highest number of simultaneous accesses of any video, with the previous highest being only 100,000. 

Japanese TV station NHK premiered a documentary about Utada on January 15, 2011, entitled , a documentary featuring studio performances (&quot;Show Me Love (Not a Dream)&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Happiness&quot;) as well as a few clips from the Wild Life performances. It also featured a post–Wild Life interview with J-Wave host Chris Peppler, in which she expressed a desire to travel and do volunteer work overseas. She said she would continue writing music during the hiatus. The documentary was also broadcast internationally, in Europe on February 2, 2011, and in the US on February 12, 2011, on the NHK channel (TV Japan in America, and JSTV in Europe). A DVD and Blu-ray release of Wild Life were confirmed and initially set for release on April 6, 2011. However, on March 24, 2011, Utada tweeted that both the DVD/Blu-ray of the Wild Life tour had been postponed, due to the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan damaging the pressing factories. The DVD was released on April 20, 2011, with the Blu-ray following. On December 7, 2011, Recochoku updated their yearly download and awards chart, with her &quot;Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1&quot; listed as the second-most-downloaded album of 2011.

On November 16, 2012, Utada&#x27;s YouTube account uploaded a video entitled &quot;桜流し&quot; (&quot;Sakura Nagashi&quot;, meaning &quot;Flowing Cherry Blossoms&quot;). The single was co-written with Paul Carter, and was digitally released on November 17, 2012. A DVD single was released a month later. &quot;Sakura Nagashi&quot; is the theme song from the animation movie &quot;&quot;. In September 2012, the British EMI group was broken up and sold to various companies. On April 1, 2013, Utada&#x27;s record company, EMI Music Japan, was absorbed into Universal Music Japan, became defunct as a company and was renamed to EMI Records Japan. Therefore, all of her further releases before switching to Sony Music Entertainment Japan would be through Universal Music Japan. On December 9, 2013, to celebrate the 15th anniversary of &quot;First Love&quot;, EMI Records released &quot;&quot; tour footage on iTunes and announced a re-release of &quot;First Love&quot;, including a special limited edition that contained the original album remastered, instrumentals from the original tracks, unreleased tracks and live footage from Utada&#x27;s first live show, &quot;Luv Live&quot;. On December 8, 2014, Universal Music Japan released a tribute album entitled &quot;Utada Hikaru no Uta&quot;. The album features cover versions of Utada&#x27;s back catalogue of songs by different popular artists such as AI, Ayumi Hamasaki, Peabo Bryson, Ringo Shiina, and more. On December 26, 2014, Universal Music Japan revealed through media outlet &quot;Weekly Bunshun&quot; that Utada only has one album left before the contract with the label ends, and that a comeback in the music industry was under discussion.

===2015–2016: Parenthood and &quot;Fantôme&quot;===
On July 3, 2015, Utada revealed the birth of a son on her blog, and mentioned work on an album primarily written during pregnancy. She asked for patience leading up to the release during the transition into parenthood.

That same day, Utada&#x27;s website announced the official song&#x27;s release, as digital singles, on April 15. Utada&#x27;s website was also updated with the announcement of a project titled &quot;New-Turn&quot;, in which fans were encouraged to purchase her music and to use the hashtag &quot;#おかえりHIKKI&quot; (&quot;Welcome Back Hikki&quot;) on Twitter. The aim was to use proceeds from the music purchased to plant more cherry blossom trees in the tsunami-damaged areas of Japan after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. The website also confirmed her return to artistic activities.

On August 8, 2016, the album&#x27;s title, track list and cover were released. The album&#x27;s title was announced as &quot;Fantôme&quot; (French: &#x27;ghost&#x27;), containing eight new songs, as well as the previous three singles, for a track listing totaling eleven tracks.

<text>The postage stamps and postal history of British Columbia started in 1860 with the issue of a single brownish-rose stamp depicting Queen Victoria in profile and denominated as 2½ pence. It was issued jointly by Vancouver Island and British Columbia as each colony had insufficient postal trade to justify printing separate stamps. In 1862, Vancouver Island adopted decimal currency and sold the stamp for 5 cents, before issuing its own 5 and 10 cent stamps in September 1865. Meanwhile, British Columbia had increased the postal rate to 3 pence but continued to use the unified stamp. In November 1865, British Columbia issued its own stamps and the unified stamp became invalid. In 1866, the two colonies were united as British Columbia.

==Colonies==

In 1860, the colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia issued a postage stamp inscribed with the names of both British Columbia and Vancouver Island.
The British Colony of Vancouver Island (also known as Vancouver&#x27;s Island) was established in 1849, after the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company founded Fort Camosack (later Fort Victoria) in 1843.

The Fraser River Gold Rush of 1858 caused an influx of settlers to the mainland, via Vancouver Island, and after this, British Columbia was made a new colony on the mainland. In 1866, the two colonies were united as British Columbia and, in 1871, this became a province of Canada.

==Stamp details==

The unified stamp was issued for reasons of economy, both colonies having sufficient customers to justify the printing of stamps, but not enough to justify separate issues for each colony. The one stamp was denominated 2½ pence, depicting Queen Victoria in profile, and was surface-printed in a brownish-rose color by De La Rue. 235,440 were printed.

In 1862, Vancouver Island switched to decimal currency, and sold the unified stamp for 5 cents. It first issued its own 5- and 10-cent stamps in September 1865. In June 1864, British Columbia increased its postal rate to 3 pence, selling the unified stamp for 3d until its own stamps became available in November 1865. Pairs of stamps, used to pay a special rate to Vancouver Island, were also sold at 15 cents per pair. Although after 1865, the 2½d stamp was officially invalid, in 1867 some were made available at a 6¼ cent rate to express mail operators.

The upshot of all this was the single type of stamp was sold for 2½d, 3d, 5c, 6¼c, and 7½c without ever receiving a surcharge indicating a changed value.

The surviving unified stamps sell for about US$250 , but much more if they are in good condition and well-centered.

<text>The House of Burgesses () was the lower house of the Virginia General Assembly from 1619 to 1776. It existed during the colonial history of the United States in the Colony of Virginia in what was then British America. From 1642 to 1776, the House of Burgesses was an important feature of Virginian politics, alongside the Crown-appointed colonial governor and the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council, the upper house of the General Assembly.

When Virginia declared its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain during the Fifth Virginia Convention in 1776 and became the independent Commonwealth of Virginia, the House of Burgesses was transformed into the House of Delegates, which continues to serve as the lower house of the General Assembly.

==Title==

&quot;Burgess&quot; originally referred to a freeman of a borough, a self-governing town or settlement in England.

==History==
===Founding===
The Colony of Virginia was founded by a joint-stock company, the Virginia Company, as a private venture, though under a royal charter. Early governors provided the stern leadership and harsh judgments required for the colony to survive its early difficulties.

Early crises with famine, disease, Native American raids, the need to establish cash crops, and lack of skilled or committed labor, meant the colony needed to attract enough new and responsible settlers if it were to grow and prosper.

To encourage settlers to come to Virginia, in November 1618 the Virginia Company&#x27;s leaders gave instructions to the new governor, Sir George Yeardley, which became known as &quot;the great charter.&quot;

It established that immigrants who paid their own way to Virginia would receive fifty acres of land and not be mere tenants. The civil authority would control the military. In 1619, based on the instructions, Governor Yeardley initiated the election of 22 burgesses by the settlements and Jamestown. They, together with the royally appointed Governor and six-member Council of State, would form the first General Assembly as a unicameral body.

The governor could veto its actions and the Company still maintained overall control of the venture, but the settlers would have a limited say in the management of their own affairs, including their finances.

A House of Assembly was created at the same time in Bermuda (which had also been settled by the Virginia Company, and was by then managed by its offshoot, the Somers Isles Company) and held its first session in 1620.

A handful of Polish craftsmen, brought to the colony to supply skill in the manufacture of pitch, tar, potash, and soap ash, were initially denied full political rights. They downed their tools in protest but returned to work after being declared free and enfranchised, apparently by agreement with the Virginia Company.

===First session===
On July 30, 1619, Governor Yeardley convened the Virginia General Assembly as the first representative legislature in the Americas for a six-day meeting at the new timber church on Jamestown Island, Virginia. The unicameral Assembly was composed of the Governor, a Council of State appointed by the Virginia Company, and the 22 locally elected representatives.

The Assembly&#x27;s first session of July 30, 1619, was cut short by an outbreak of malaria and adjourned after five days. On the third day of the assembly, the assembly&#x27;s Journal noted &quot;Mr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased.&quot; Twenty-two (22) members were sent to the assembly from the following constituencies: 
* from James City: William Powell and William Spence
* from Charles City: Samuel Sharpe and Samuel Jordan
* from the City of Henricus: Thomas Dowse and John Pollington
* from Kecoughtan: William Tucker and William Capps
* from Smythe&#x27;s Hundred: Thomas Graves and Walter Shelley
* from Martin&#x27;s Hundred: John Boys and John Jackson
* from Argall&#x27;s Gift Plantation: Thomas Pawlett and Edward Gourgainy
* from Flowerdew Hundred Plantation: Edmund Rossingham and John Jefferson
* from Lawne&#x27;s Plantation: Christopher Lawne and Thomas Washer
* from Ward&#x27;s Plantation: John Warde and John Gibbs
* from Martin&#x27;s Brandon: Thomas Davis and Robert Stacy
The latter two burgesses were excluded from the assembly because John Martin refused to give up a clause in his land patent that exempted his borough &quot;from any command of the colony except it be aiding and assisting the same against any foreign or domestic enemy.&quot;

===Later 17th century===
Especially after the massacre of almost 400 colonists on March 22, 1622, by Native Americans, and epidemics in the winters before and after the massacre, the governor and council ruled arbitrarily, showing great contempt for the assembly and allowing no dissent.

By 1624, the royal government in London had heard enough about the problems of the colony and revoked the charter of the Virginia Company. Virginia became a crown colony and the governor and council would be appointed by the Crown. Nonetheless, the Assembly maintained management of local affairs with some informal royal assent, although it was not royally confirmed until 1639.

In 1634, the General Assembly divided the colony into eight shires (later renamed counties) for purposes of government, administration, and the judicial system. By 1643, the expanding colony had 15 counties. All of the county offices, including a board of commissioners, judges, sheriff, constable, and clerks, were appointed positions. Only the burgesses were elected by a vote of the people. Women had no right to vote. Only free and white men originally were given the right to vote, by 1670 only property owners were allowed to vote.

In 1642, Governor William Berkeley urged the creation of a bicameral legislature which the Assembly promptly implemented; the House of Burgesses was thus formed and met separately from the Council of State.

In 1652, the parliamentary forces of Oliver Cromwell forced the colony to submit to being taken over by the English government. Again, the colonists were able to retain the General Assembly as their governing body. Only taxes agreed to by the assembly were to be levied. Still, most Virginia colonists were loyal to Prince Charles and were pleased with his restoration as King Charles II in 1660. He went on to directly or indirectly restrict some of the liberties of the colonists, such as requiring tobacco to be shipped only to England, only on English ships, with the price set by the English merchant buyers; but the General Assembly remained.

A majority of the members of the General Assembly of 1676 were supporters of Nathaniel Bacon. They enacted legislation designed to further popular sovereignty and representative government and to equalize opportunities. Bacon took little part in the deliberations since he was busy fighting the Native Americans.

In 1691, the House of Burgesses abolished the enslavement of Native peoples; however, many Powhatans were held in servitude well into the 18th century.

The statehouse in Jamestown burned down for the fourth time on October 20, 1698. The General Assembly met temporarily in Middle Plantation, inland from Jamestown, and then in 1699 permanently moved the capital of the colony to Middle Plantation, which they renamed Williamsburg.

==Moving toward independence==
The French and Indian War in North America from 1754 to 1763 resulted in local colonial losses and economic disruption. Higher taxes were to follow, and adverse local reactions to these and how they were determined would drive events well into the next decade.

In 1764, desiring revenue from its North American colonies, Parliament passed the first law specifically aimed at raising colonial money for the Crown. The Sugar Act increased duties on non-British goods shipped to the colonies. The same year, the Currency Act prohibited American colonies from issuing their own currency. These angered many American colonists and began colonial opposition with protests. By the end of the year, many colonies were practicing non-importation, a refusal to use imported British goods.

In 1765, the British Quartering Act, which required the colonies to provide barracks and supplies to British troops, further angered American colonists; and to raise more money for Britain, Parliament enacted the Stamp Act on the American colonies, to tax newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, broadsides, legal documents, dice, and playing cards. American colonists responded to Parliament&#x27;s acts with organized protest throughout the colonies. A network of secret organizations known as the Sons of Liberty was created to intimidate the stamp agents collecting the taxes, and before the Stamp Act could take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the colonies had resigned. The Massachusetts Assembly suggested a meeting of all colonies to work for the repeal of the Stamp Act, and all but four colonies were represented. The colonists also increased their non-importation efforts, and sought to increase in local production.
In May 1765, Patrick Henry presented a series of resolves that became known as the Virginia Resolves, denouncing the Stamp Act and denying the authority of the British parliament to tax the colonies, since they were not represented by elected members of parliament. Newspapers around the colonies published all his resolves, even the most radical ones which had not been passed by the assembly. The assembly also sent a 1768 Petition, Memorial, and Remonstrance to Parliament.

From 1769–1775 Thomas Jefferson represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He pursued reforms to slavery and introduced legislation allowing masters to take control over the emancipation of slaves in 1769, taking discretion away from the royal Governor and General Court. Jefferson persuaded his cousin Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation&#x27;s passage, but the reaction was strongly negative.

In 1769 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed several resolutions condemning Britain&#x27;s stationing troops in Boston following the Massachusetts Circular Letter of the previous year; these resolutions stated that only Virginia&#x27;s governor and legislature could tax its citizens. The members also drafted a formal letter to the King, completing it just before the legislature was dissolved by Virginia&#x27;s royal governor.
In 1774, after Parliament passed the Boston Port Act to close Boston Harbor, the House of Burgesses adopted resolutions in support of the Boston colonists which resulted in Virginia&#x27;s royal governor, John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, dissolving the assembly. The burgesses then reassembled on their own and issued calls for the first of five Virginia Conventions. These conventions were essentially meetings of the House of Burgesses without the governor and Council, Peyton Randolph the Speaker of the House would serve as the President of the convention, and they would elect delegates to the Continental Congress. The First Continental Congress passed their Declaration and Resolves, which &quot;inter alia&quot; claimed that American colonists were equal to all other British citizens, protested against taxation without representation, and stated that Britain could not tax the colonists since they were not represented in Parliament.

In 1775 the burgesses, meeting in conventions, listened to Patrick Henry deliver his &quot;give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech and raised regiments. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North&#x27;s Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to take his place as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress. The burgesses formed a Committee of Safety to take over governance in the absence of the royal governor, Dunmore, who had organized loyalists forces but after defeats, he took refuge on a British warship.

In 1776 the House of Burgesses ended. The final entry in the &quot;Journals of the House of Burgesses&quot; is &quot;6th of May. 16 Geo. III. 1776 … FINIS.&quot; Edmund Pendleton, a member of the House of Burgesses (and President of the Committee of Safety) who was present at the final meeting, wrote in a letter to Richard Henry Lee on the following day, &quot;We met in an assembly yesterday and determined not to adjourn, but let that body die.&quot; Later on the same morning, the members of the fifth and final Virginia Revolutionary Convention met in the chamber of the House of Burgesses in Williamsburg and elected Pendleton its president. The convention voted for independence from Britain. The former colony had become the independent Commonwealth of Virginia and the convention created the Constitution of Virginia with a new General Assembly, composed of an elected Senate and an elected House of Delegates. The House of Delegates acceded to the role of the former House of Burgesses.

==Meeting places==

In 1619, the General Assembly first met in the church in Jamestown. Subsequent meetings continued to take place in Jamestown.

In 1700, the seat of the House of Burgesses was moved from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, near what was soon renamed Williamsburg. The Burgesses met there, first (1700 to 1704) in the Great Hall of what is now called the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary, while the Capitol was under construction. When the Capitol burned in 1747, the legislature moved back into the college until the second Capitol was completed in 1754. The present Capitol building at Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstruction of the earlier of the two lost buildings.

In 1779, and effective in April 1780, the House of Delegates moved the capital city to Richmond during the American Revolutionary War for safety reasons.

==Legacy==
The House of Burgesses became the House of Delegates in 1776, retaining its status as the lower house of the General Assembly, the legislative branch of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Through the General Assembly and House of Burgesses, the Virginia House of Delegates is considered the oldest continuous legislative body in the New World.

In honor of the original House of Burgesses, every four years, the Virginia General Assembly traditionally leaves the current Capitol in Richmond and meets for one day in the restored Capitol building at Colonial Williamsburg. The most recent commemorative session (the 26th) was held in January 2016.

In January 2007, the Assembly held a special session at Jamestown to mark the 400th anniversary of its founding as part of the Jamestown 2007 celebration, including an address by then-Vice-President Dick Cheney.

In January 2019, to mark the 400th anniversary of the House of Burgesses, the Virginia House of Representatives Clerk&#x27;s Office announced a new Database of House Members called &quot;DOME&quot; that &quot;[chronicles] the 9,700-plus men and women who served as burgesses or delegates in the Virginia General Assembly over the past four centuries.&quot;

<text>The University of Alberta (also known as U of A or UAlberta, ) is a public research university located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It was founded in 1908 by Alexander Cameron Rutherford, the first premier of Alberta, and Henry Marshall Tory, the university&#x27;s first president. It was enabled through the &quot;Post-secondary Learning Act.&quot; The university is considered a &quot;comprehensive academic and research university&quot; (CARU), which means that it offers a range of academic and professional programs that generally lead to undergraduate and graduate level credentials.

The university comprises four campuses in Edmonton, an Augustana Campus in Camrose, and a staff centre in downtown Calgary. The original north campus consists of 150 buildings covering 50 city blocks on the south rim of the North Saskatchewan River valley, across and west from downtown Edmonton. 39,000 students from Canada and 150 other countries participate in 400 programs in 18 faculties.

The university is a major economic driver for Alberta. In 2022, it contributed $19.4 billion to Alberta&#x27;s economy, or over five per cent of that year&#x27;s gross domestic product. The University of Alberta has produced over 260,000 graduates; awards received by alumni and faculty members include 3 Nobel Prizes and 72 Rhodes Scholarships.

==History==
The university was chartered in 1906 in Edmonton, Alberta as a single, public provincial university through the &quot;University Act&quot;, passed during the first session of the then-new Legislative Assembly, with Premier Alexander C. Rutherford as the legislation&#x27;s sponsor. The university was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research. The governance was modelled on Ontario&#x27;s &quot;University of Toronto Act&quot; of 1906, with a bicameral system consisting of a senate (faculty) responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) controlling financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.

=== Establishment in Edmonton ===

Heated wrangling took place between the cities of Calgary and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it. The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of Strathcona on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were amalgamated in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.

With Henry Marshall Tory as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction. In a letter to Rutherford in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up McGill University College in Vancouver, Tory wrote, &quot;If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.&quot;

Of the 45 students in the university&#x27;s first cohort in 1908, seven were women. These original seven formed a type of sorority, called Seven Independent Spinsters, or S.I.S., with the intention of supporting the women&#x27;s social and academic needs. In 1909, the group changed its name to the Wuaneita Club, and then to the Wuaneita Society in 1910. All female students at the university were initiated into the Society every fall. The group heavily appropriated from Cree culture: the name Wuaneita is a rough equivalent to the Cree word meaning &quot;kind-hearted&quot;; their initiation ceremonies featured costumes with feathers and headdresses; the society president was called the &quot;Big Chief&quot;: and the motto of the group was &quot;payuk uche kukeyow, mena kukeyow uche payuk,” a rough translation into Cree of &quot;all for one, one for all&quot; that is still engraved above the outer doors of Pembina Hall on main campus. For much of the Wuaneita Society&#x27;s existence, as they were coopting First Nations traditions and ceremonies, the Potlatch ban was in effect in Canada. The group wound down in 1973 once the population of female students on campus had outgrown the need for a supportive society.
Under Tory&#x27;s guidance, the early years were marked by recruitment of professors and construction of the first campus buildings. Today, he has a building named after him that houses classes of all types. Among the first professor&#x27;s Tory hired was William Muir Edwards, the second child of women&#x27;s rights activist Henrietta Edwards.

Percy Erskine Nobbs &amp; Frank Darling designed the master plan for the University of Alberta in 1909–10. Nobbs designed the Arts Building (1914–15), laboratories and Power House (1914). With Cecil S. Burgess, Nobbs designed the Provincial College of Medicine (1920–21). Architect Herbert Alton Magoon designed several buildings on campus, including St. Stephen&#x27;s Methodist College (1910) and the residence for professor Rupert C. Lodge (1913). The University of Alberta awarded its first degrees in 1912, the same year it established the Department of Extension. The Faculty of Medicine was established the following year, and the Faculty of Agriculture began in 1915.

But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918. The university organized the recruitment of staff and students for XI Canadian Field Ambulance (Western Universities) in early 1916, and soon afterward it raised &#x27;C&#x27; Company of the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion. Both of these units were organized by a committee composed of representatives from the University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Saskatchewan, and University of Manitoba, with each institution encouraging their staff and students to volunteer. The University of Alberta&#x27;s recruits for XI Canadian Field Ambulance were billeted in Athabasca Hall before departing for Winnipeg in March 1916, while the men of C Company stayed in Assiniboia Hall until June of that same year. Between 1914 and 1918, the number of students and staff serving overseas (in a number of different units) was greater than the number of students registered in each academic year. Roughly half of the university&#x27;s staff and students were serving overseas by 1916. 82 staff and students from the University of Alberta died during their service in the First World War, and hundreds more were wounded.

Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy). It awarded a range of degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA), Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Bachelor of Pharmacy (PhmB), Bachelor of Divinity (BD), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science (MSc), and Doctor of Laws (LLD). There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.

=== Campus expansion ===

The Breton Soil Plots were established at the faculty of agriculture from 1929 – present to provide agricultural research on fertilization, usage, crop rotations and farming practices on Gray-Luvisolic soils (Gray-Wooded), which cover many regions in western Canada.

The University of Alberta spearheaded an extraordinary rate of volunteerism in the province of Alberta to the First World War, especially from its medical faculty. Experience gained was used by returning veterans to rapidly mature the young Faculty of Medicine. The War Memorial Committee commissioned a War Memorial Pipe Organ to be erected by the Casavant Frères in U of A Convocation Hall in 1925 in memory of 80 University of Alberta comrades who gave up their lives during the Great War.

In the early part of the 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced. In 1929, the university established a College of Education. This period of growth was to be short-lived, though, as the Great Depression and the Second World War curtailed enrolment and expansion until 1945. The university also gained new public powers. In 1928, the university&#x27;s senate was granted the power to oversee and appoint half of the Alberta Eugenics Board, charged with recommending individuals for sterilization.

Spurred by postwar growth in the student population and the discovery of oil in Leduc in 1947, the University of Alberta underwent expansion through the 1950s that continued through the 1960s as the baby-boom generation swelled the enrolment ranks. These two decades also saw expansion of campus buildings, including new buildings for the faculties of physical education and education, and the Cameron Library. The University of Alberta Press, concentrating on western Canadian history, general science and ecology, was founded in 1969.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary. By 1966, the University of Calgary had been established as an autonomous institution.

From the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Collège Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences, its biotron facility, and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls. New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre. Another new building, the distinctive Universiade Pavilion (nicknamed the &quot;Butterdome&quot;), was completed as part of the university&#x27;s preparations to host the World University Games in 1983, the first time the event was held in North America.

===Modern challenges===

The 1990s were a time of financial constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks. However, there was a time in which the university benefited from philanthropic support. The $11 million Timms Centre for the Arts, which began construction in 1993, was made possible by a large donation from its namesake, Albert Timms. In 1998, Gladys Young&#x27;s $3.5-million donation to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from the U of A in 1928, was the largest private donation for undergraduate scholarships in the university&#x27;s history.

The early 2000s brought substantial funding increases. High energy prices drove Alberta&#x27;s energy boom resulting in multibillion-dollar government surpluses and the subsequent creation of a $4.5 billion provincial post-secondary educational endowment. In 2005, the university hired Indira Samarasekera as its 12th president, embarking on an ambitious plan to establish itself as one of the world&#x27;s top public research universities. These plans were hampered by the 2008 economic downturn, and by late March 2008, the university&#x27;s endowment had shrunk by more than $100 million, almost 14 per cent of its value. The university predicted a $59-million budget shortfall in 2009 before provincial cuts brought that figure to $79 million. To close the budgetary gap, the university increased non-instructional fees by $290 per year laid off teaching and support staff, and even eliminated phones in some departments (such as English and Film Studies).

The 2013 Alberta Budget cut provincial post-secondary grants by $147 million, including a 7.2 per cent cut to the university&#x27;s base operating grant. The university is covering its resulting shortfall by reducing total spending in 2013 by $28 million, then cutting an additional $56 million to balance its budget by the spring of 2015.

The 2015 Alberta Budget released in October 2015 restored a 1.4 per cent cut to the U of A&#x27;s operational funding, and provided for an additional two per cent increase in the 2015-16 fiscal year. The budget also included a two-year tuition freeze. October also saw the launch of an institutional strategic planning process intended to prompt discussion and gather feedback on the university&#x27;s strategic priorities, with the goal of assuming a national leadership role in post-secondary education.

The 2019 Alberta Budget released in October 2019 reduced grants to the provincial post-secondary sector, including a $44-million reduction for the U of A and an additional freeze of $35 million allocated for infrastructure. In early 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the United Conservative Party announced an additional $110-million cut to funding for the U of A. While outgoing University President David H. Turpin announced that the cuts would necessitate 400 job losses by March 31 and more than 600 additional positions would need to be eliminated in 2020–2021, incoming University President Bill Flanagan began campus discussions about how to manage the cuts, including reducing the number of faculties and departments, and streamlining administration staffing.

==Academics==
The U of A has about 39,300 students, including 7,700 graduate students and 7,800 international students representing 151 countries. The university has 3,620 academic staff along with 15,380 support and trust staff. University professors have won more 3M Teaching Fellowships (Canada&#x27;s top award for undergraduate teaching excellence) than any other Canadian university, 41 awards since 1986. The university offers post-secondary education in about 388 undergraduate and 500 graduate programs. Tuition and fees for both fall and winter semesters are slightly more than $5,000 for a typical undergraduate arts student, although they vary widely by program. The University of Alberta switched from a 9-point grading scale to the more common 4-point grading scale in September 2003. Seventy-two Rhodes Scholars have come from the University of Alberta. The University of Alberta also holds 2,599 Academic All-Canadians, the most of any University in Canada.

===Faculties and colleges===

The university has two affiliated colleges:

* St. Joseph&#x27;s College offers undergraduate courses in applied ethics, philosophy, religious education and theology, for credit in degree programs with arts options. The college also offers specific courses for education students intending to teach within Alberta&#x27;s Catholic school system.
* St. Stephen&#x27;s College offers graduate degree, diploma and certificate programs in theological studies, with courses designed to allow distance learning. It was originally a training centre for Protestant ministers.

===Academic Restructuring Model===
The University of Alberta made the decision to academically restructure its faculties in response to a reduction in its provincial operating grant, which would require the university to reduce expenses by $120 million in the next three years. Three restructuring models were proposed before the university&#x27;s Board of Governors approved the academic restructuring plans on December 11, 2020. This restructuring model will be effective as of July 1, 2021. The remaining faculties (Augustana, Campus Saint-Jean, and Faculty of Native Studies) will remain as stand-alone faculties.

===Libraries===
The University of Alberta library system received a tremendous boost with the opening of the Rutherford Library in May 1951. , according to the Association of Research Libraries, the library system is rated 11th in North America and is the second-largest, by number of volumes held, among all Canadian universities, after the University of Toronto Library. With over 10.6 million items combined with online access to more than one million electronic books and more than 1,500 electronic databases, the library system ranks first in Canada in terms of the number of volumes per student.

The library system comprises the following specialty libraries:
* Augustana Campus Library
* Bibliothèque Saint-Jean
* Research &amp; Collections Resource Facility (RCRF)
* Cameron Library (Science &amp; Technology)
*Geoffrey &amp; Robyn Sperber Health Sciences Library
* Herbert T. Coutts Library (Education &amp; Physical Education - closed in 2020 )
* John A. Weir Memorial Law Library
* John W. Scott Health Sciences Library (closed)
* Rutherford Library (Humanities &amp; Social Sciences)
* St. Joseph&#x27;s College Library

The university is home to an American Library Association-accredited School of Library and Information Studies, which offers a Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS) program. The school was housed in Rutherford South, the original four-storey brick, marble and oak main campus library, which opened in 1951. As of 2018, the school has since moved into the Education North building.

==Research==

The university is a member of the U15 universities and the Worldwide Universities Network, an organization of 19 universities on six continents. In 2018, Research Infosource named the University of Alberta the fifth best research university, with a sponsored research income (external sources of funding) of $513.313 million in 2017. In the same year, the university&#x27;s faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $242,100, while its graduate students averaged a sponsored research income of $69,400. The university receives nearly $500 million each year for research from external sources. The university houses over 400 distinct research laboratories.

The university&#x27;s research performance has been noted in several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked the university 81st in the world, and fourth in Canada, whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 78th in the world, and fourth in Canada.

The University of Alberta is the national scientific and administrative headquarters for:
* Sustainable Forest Management Network

In 2011, researchers at the University of Alberta linked the reproductive ecology of polar bears in Canada&#x27;s Hudson Bay with decreasing litter sizes and loss of sea ice.

===Agriculture===
Cattle researcher Roy Berg revolutionized the world&#x27;s beef industry with his innovations in crossbreeding, which led to a 30 to 40 per cent increase in production and contributed to Alberta&#x27;s world leadership in beef production.

===Energy, oilsands and environment===
In the 1920s, engineering professor Karl Clark developed a hot-water extraction process to separate bitumen from oilsands. Geology professor Charlie Stelck&#x27;s idea to search for oil and gas deposits near ancient coral reefs led to the discovery of oil in Leduc, Alberta, in 1947 and in the Pembina Oil Field in 1953. Today, more than 1,000 researchers at the University of Alberta are working together on oilsands issues and their environmental effects, including carbon capture and storage, tailings-pond reclamation and water preservation.

University of Alberta&#x27;s SLOWPOKE-2 non-power (reactor power 20 kW thermal) reactor operating licence was renewed and was valid from July 1, 2013, until June 30, 2023. However, the University of Alberta applied for, and was issued a Licence to Decommission its SLOWPOKE-2 Nuclear Research Reactor Facility in 2017.

An extensively renovated and refurbished historic Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store in downtown Edmonton, renamed Enterprise Square, serves as a campus for adult students belonging to the Faculty of Extension. The university owns a set of large parcels of mostly undeveloped land (used as an experimental farm and the site of several agricultural and sports facilities) slightly south of the main campus, called South Campus (previously the University Farm).

===North Campus===

The North Campus is the original location of the University of Alberta. Located on the southern banks of the North Saskatchewan River, it has 150 buildings on of land.

Architect Barton Myers completed the long-range campus plan in 1969 and continued as a planner for the university until 1978.

The distinctive cupola of the Dentistry/Pharmacy Centre on North Campus was featured in a commemorative stamp issued by Canada Post in 2008, the year of the university&#x27;s centenary.

===South Campus===
Located two kilometres south of the North Campus, the South Campus is much larger in terms of land area. The two campuses are linked by the Edmonton LRT system. South Campus/Fort Edmonton Park station is near Foote Field and the Saville Community Sports Centre, forming a natural gateway to the new campus architectural model, since 2009. Along with Health Sciences, University, and Enterprise Square stations, the LRT connects the U of A through four stations. In addition to educational facilities, the university is closely affiliated with six non-profit day care centres, many of which run partnered initiatives such as the Physical Literacy for Active Youth (PLAY) Program as an educational practical learning experience for University of Alberta students.

Much of the university&#x27;s agricultural research in food safety and crop use for food and industrial products happens at the Edmonton Research Station Experimental Farms on South Campus. This campus is also home to the Saville Community Sports Centre, a 32,500-square-metre, multi-use recreation facility that hosts 14 varsity teams and several community sports clubs. In 2013, the Saville Centre became the new training centre for the Canadian senior women&#x27;s basketball team.

===Campus Saint-Jean===
The Campus Saint-Jean is a francophone campus located five kilometres east of the main campus, in Bonnie Doon, formerly named &quot;Faculté Saint-Jean&quot;. It is the only French-language university campus west of Manitoba. Due to increasing enrolment, the Campus Saint-Jean is undergoing expansion, acquiring new laboratory and classroom spaces. Students at Campus Saint-Jean pursue bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the sciences or arts, or complete their first year of Engineering, after which they often transfer to the University of Alberta&#x27;s main campus. Bilingual Nursing and Business programs are also available.

===Augustana Campus===
The Augustana Campus is located in Camrose, a small city in rural Alberta about 100 km southeast of Edmonton. In 2004, the former Augustana University College in Camrose merged with the University of Alberta, thus creating the new satellite Augustana Campus. Students enrolled at the Augustana Campus currently pursue four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees in arts, sciences, or music.

===Enterprise Square===
Enterprise Square opened for business January 15, 2008 on the north side of the North Saskatchewan river in downtown Edmonton. It is located in the historical building previously occupied by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The building underwent major renovations. Enterprise Square houses the University of Alberta Faculty of Extension, the professional development activities of the Alberta School of Business, the Alberta Business Family Institute, and the Design Gallery. It is the home of the University of Alberta Alumni Association.

==Investment in health and science==
$1.6 billion in construction has been undertaken at the university related to fields in health and science. The projects expand the University of Alberta&#x27;s research capacity in the field of health. Over the past five years, the University of Alberta has averaged nearly $500 million in external research funding a year. The funding is expected to increase due to added research and teaching capacity.

===Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science===

A major project, completed in the spring of 2011 with a grand opening on September 23, 2011, was the $400-million, Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS), a facility for interdisciplinary research groups, as well as the Department of Physics, the Faculty of Science offices and the Interdepartmental Science Students&#x27; Society&#x27;s office. Three buildings – V-Wing (a large one-floor building composed of 10 lecture halls, of which two will remain), the Avadh Bhatia Physics Building (a six-storey building formerly housing the Department of Physics offices and laboratories), and the old Centre for Subatomic Research – were demolished to make way for CCIS.

===Edmonton Clinic Health Academy===

The Edmonton Clinic (formerly the Health Science Ambulatory Learning Centre) is a joint project with Alberta Health Services, and consists of two separate buildings. Construction started in 2008 on the multidisciplinary health science facilities totalling $909 million and 170,000 square metres surrounding the Health Sciences LRT Station. Edmonton Clinic South (now known as Kaye Edmonton Clinic, a nine-storey building, will focus on patient care and house most of the medical and dental clinics, while the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy (ECHA) is a six-storey building that is the home of interdisciplinary health research and education currently held at the university. The Edmonton Clinic Health Academy, owned and operated by the University of Alberta, officially opened in January 2012. The Kaye Edmonton Clinic, owned and operated by Alberta Health Services, opened in December 2012.

===Health research innovation facilities===

Two new $300-million buildings adjacent to the Heritage Medical Research Centre building on the main campus, along with existing health-care and health research facilities and the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy, form a health precinct of two city blocks dedicated to health research, education and patient care. The newest facilities form a translational research centre designed to create an environment for &quot;bench-to-bedside&quot; health research by increasing interaction between researchers and clinicians focused on common medical issues. A total of 65,000 square metres (699,700 square feet) gross area constructed on two sites contribute to research by allowing the university to hire over 100 additional biomedical and health researchers. This is projected to result in a doubling of research funding by 2014.

Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research

The hub of the complex is the Katz Group Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research (formerly HRIF West), an eight-storey building that provides the main entrance to the complex and becomes the critical link between Medical Sciences Building and Heritage Medical Research Centre. The Katz Group Centre is a teaching and research facility. It is home to the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, led by scientific director Lorne Tyrrell, MD, PhD, and includes some of the world&#x27;s top virologists, including Michael Houghton, PhD, Canada Excellence Research Chair and Li Ka Shing Chair in Virology, who co-led the team that discovered the hepatitis C virus during his previous career in private industry. The facility is located on the corner of 87 Avenue and 114 Street in Edmonton, Alberta.

Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation

The Li Ka Shing Centre for Health Research Innovation (formerly HRIF East) anchors the southeast corner of the health precinct and is also home to the Alberta Diabetes Institute (ADI). Both the east and west buildings of HRIF are linked at every floor to the Heritage Medical Research Centre with the exception of Level 1 of HRIF West. The facility is dedicated to health research. The facility is named in honour of a gift in 2010 of $28 million from the Li Ka Shing (Canada) Foundation that helped establish the Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology ($25M) and a joint PhD program ($3M) between the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry and Shantou University Medical College in China. As of fall 2012, this remains the largest single cash gift to the University of Alberta. The facility is located on the corner of 87 Avenue and 112 Street in Edmonton, Alberta.

==Student life==

The student body of the University of Alberta is represented by two students&#x27; unions, the University of Alberta Students&#x27; Union for all undergraduate students, and the Graduate Student Association for all graduate students. In addition, a number of the university&#x27;s academic programs also manage their own student representative body. Students within the residences are represented by a number of associations, primarily the University of Alberta Residence Halls Association. there are more than 450 student organizations and clubs, covering a wide range of interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. The undergraduate student union, as well as many of the student organizations, are centred in the university&#x27;s student activity centre, the Students&#x27; Union Building. The building was opened in 1967, and hosts the majority of the Students&#x27; Union services and business operations. The two primary media outlets amongst the student population is the student newspaper, The Gateway, and campus radio, CJSR-FM.

===Greek life===
From 1909 to 1929, the university held a ban against fraternities and sororities, since Henry Marshall Tory, the first president of the university, ordered all secret societies, including Upsilon Upsilon and Pi Sigma Phi, to be disbanded. The drive to remove the ban begun in 1927, when students had formed the Athenian Club to lobby the university. During the same year, several men had formed the Rocky Mountain Goat Club, which was only official sanctioned due to the lack of any secret rituals or a written constitution. The ban on fraternities and sororities would end in 1929, with the departure of President Tory. Members of the Rocky Mountain Goat Club had later formed the nucleus of the university&#x27;s first fraternities. Phi Delta Theta was the first fraternity officially recognized and chartered on September 2, 1930. Fraternities and sororities are recognized as student groups by the university and Students&#x27; Union through Student Group Services. They are supported by local alumni advisors, their international headquarters, and a fraternity and sorority advisor. In addition, the fraternities are also governed by the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Council.

There are eleven fraternity chapters recognized as a student group by the university. There are currently six sorority chapters recognized by the university.

The university also operates the Universiade Pavilion, a multi-sport facility constructed for the 1983 Summer Universiade.

===History of Queer life===
In 1984, students formed &quot;Gays and Lesbians On Campus&quot; (GALOC). In 1985, a &quot;Pink Triangle&quot; supplement first appeared in &quot;The Gateway&quot; student newspaper. That same year, GALOC organized U of A&#x27;s first pride event, GALA Week, which became an annual event. In 1990, GALOC held &quot;Blue Jean Day&quot;, when gays, lesbians, and supporters wore denim jeans for a day; incidents of homophobia were reported. Since 2013, the university has held a Pride Week each mid-March, which includes a pride parade across North Campus. In 2021, events were held virtually.

==Insignias and other representations==

===Coat of arms===
The university coat of arms was adopted in 1909, following the recommendations of the university&#x27;s senate to adopt the coat of arms of the province of Alberta as its emblem, with the addition of an open book superimposed upon the cross and a new motto. The coat of arms had undergone a number of changes, with the arms changing in the 1950s in keeping with the graphic style of the time, and in the early 1990s, in the university&#x27;s efforts to have their arms gain official heraldic authority. The latest design was completed in 1994, being registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 31 May 1994, and was presented to the university on 13 June 1994.

The coat of arms consists of a shield displaying the topography of Alberta rendered in the colours of the university. At the base is a prairie wheat field symbolizing Alberta&#x27;s agricultural industry. The wavy gold line above represent the hills and rivers of Alberta. The top of the shield is in gold and separated from the rest of the shield by a line suggesting the Rocky Mountains. The book of learning dominates the design. A great horned owl, the provincial bird and an accepted symbol of knowledge is used as the crest of the coat of arms. The arm&#x27;s supporters is the pronghorn, taken from the provincial coat of arms, and the golden bear, the mascot of the university.

===Motto and song===
The motto of the university, , translates to &quot;whatsoever things are true.&quot; The original motto &quot;lux et lex&quot;, was first adopted in 1907, and was translated as &quot;light and law&quot; in Latin. The motto was substituted with the present motto in 1909. The motto was adopted from the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, the Epistle to the Philippians, where it states that,

Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: &quot;Alberta&quot;, with words and music by Emma Newton; &quot;Alberta Cheer Song&quot;, with words by R.K. Michael, and music by Charleston Lamberston; &quot;The Evergreen and Gold&quot;, with words by William H. Alexander, and the music taken from the National Anthem of Russia; and , with words and music by Ewart W. Stutchbury.

===Symbols===
The official colours of the university are green and gold. The green represents the wide stretches of prairie land flanked by deep spruce forests and is symbolic of hope and optimism; the gold represents the golden harvest fields and is symbolic of the light of knowledge. The original suggestion for green and gold colours came from Marion Kirby Alexander, drawing inspiration from the autumn colours of the river valley below the campus. Her husband, William Hardy Alexander, a professor at the university, relayed the suggestion to a faculty meeting on 5 October 1908 and would later gain the approval of the senate. The university colours are present throughout the institution. These colours are also displayed on the university flag. The university flag consists of the shield of the coat of arms on a gold background.

<text>The little bee-eater (Merops pusillus) is a bird species in the bee-eater family, Meropidae. They are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. They should not be confused with the little green bee-eater (&quot;Merops orientalis&quot;). Migration is limited to seasonal movements depending on rainfall patterns.

== Description ==
Members of this species, like other bee-eaters, are rich and brightly coloured slender birds. They have green upper parts, yellow throats, black gorgets, and rich brown upper breasts fading to buffish ochre on the belly. Their wings are green and brown. Their beaks and legs are black. They reach a length of 15–17 cm, which makes them the smallest African bee-eater. Sexes are alike. Often silent, their call is a soft &quot;seep&quot;.

== Ecology ==
These are abundant and tame birds, familiar throughout their range. There have been estimated to be between 60 and 80 million little bee-eaters. They breed in open country with bushes, preferably near water. Just as the name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and hornets, who are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. This species often hunts from low perches, maybe only a metre or less high. Before eating their meal, a bee-eater removes the stinger by repeatedly hitting the insect on a hard surface.

Unlike most bee-eaters, these are solitary nesters, making a tunnel in sandy banks, or sometimes in the entrance to an Aardvark den. They lay 4 to 6 spherical white eggs. Both the male and the female take care of the eggs. These birds roost communally, lined up on a tree branch.

<text>Nathaniel Pitt Langford (August 9, 1832 – October 18, 1911) was an American explorer, businessman, bureaucrat, vigilante and historian from Saint Paul, Minnesota who played an important role in the early years of the Montana gold fields, territorial government and the creation of Yellowstone National Park.

==Early life==

Langford was born in Upstate New York and moved to Saint Paul in 1854. In 1858, he became cashier of The Bank of the State of Minnesota, the first bank in the state to open under new Minnesota free banking law. The bank closed the following year.

He was involved with the investment of the Saint Anthony Park neighborhood.

==Montana gold fields==
On June 16, 1862, Langford, as a member and officer of the Northern Overland Expedition, commanded by Captain James L. Fisk, left Saint Paul to establish a wagon road to the Salmon river mine regions of the Rocky Mountains via Fort Benton. The expedition ended up at the Grasshopper Creek gold fields in the area soon to be named Bannack, Montana. There Langford and his fellow businessmen established freight companies, a saw mill and other businesses.

==Vigilante==
Langford was also part of the vigilante movement, the infamous Montana Vigilantes, that dealt with lawlessness in Virginia City and Bannack, Montana during 1863–64.

In 1890, Langford wrote &quot;Vigilante Days and Ways&quot; to chronicle the era of pioneer justice in the American Old West.

==Territorial tax collector==
In 1864, shortly after the Montana Territory was established on May 28, 1864, Langford was appointed Collector of Internal Revenue and National Bank Examiner, positions he held for five years in the Montana Territorial government.

==Yellowstone exploration and creation==

Langford was a member of the 1870 Washburn–Langford–Doane Expedition which explored portions of the region that soon would become the Yellowstone National Park. Mount Langford, in the Absaroka Range, east of Yellowstone Lake, was scaled by Langford and Doane during the expedition and named after him.

After his participation in the Washburn expedition, Langford was appointed as the first superintendent of the park. He soon got the nickname &quot;National Park Langford&quot; because of his initials &quot;N.P.&quot; There was no money available to offer him a salary for this new position, so he had to make his living elsewhere. This left Langford with little time to run the park, and he entered it only twice during his five years as superintendent. The first time was as a guest on the second Hayden Expedition in 1872, and his second took place in 1874 to evict a man named Matthew McGuirk. McGuirk claimed to own the Boiling River – one of the park&#x27;s hot springs rumored to have healing powers.
Langford had no salary, no funding for the park, and no legal way to enforce protection for its wildlife and geologic features. Political pressure, which took the guise of accusing Langford of neglect, forced the removal of Yellowstone&#x27;s first superintendent in 1877. He was replaced by Philetus W. Norris. In 1905, Langford published &quot;Diary of the Washburn Expedition to the Yellowstone and Firehole In the Year 1870&quot; as a comprehensive insider&#x27;s view of the expedition.

==Historian==
After his Yellowstone experiences, Langford returned to his home state of Minnesota and began a career as a Western historian. Prior to his passing, he served as the president of and on the board of directors of the Minnesota Historical Society.

<text>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around . They have large heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding for its distinctive appearance, including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia, heat sensitivity, and skin infections. Due to concerns about their quality of life, breeding Bulldogs is illegal in Norway and the Netherlands.

The modern Bulldog was bred as a companion dog from the Old English Bulldog, a now-extinct breed used for bull-baiting, when the sport was outlawed in England under the Cruelty to Animals Act. The Bulldog Club (in England) was formed in 1878, and the Bulldog Club of America was formed in 1890. While often used as a symbol of ferocity and courage, modern Bulldogs are generally friendly, amiable dogs. Bulldogs are now commonly kept as pets; in 2013, the Bulldog was the 12th most frequently registered breed worldwide.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald. They have short tails that can either hang down straight or be tucked in a coiled &quot;corkscrew&quot; into a tail pocket.

In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are for a male and for a female. In the United States, the standard calls for a smaller dog — a typical mature male weighs , while mature females weigh about .

=== Temperament ===

According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog&#x27;s disposition should be &quot;equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanour should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behaviour&quot;.

Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.

==Health==

=== Lifespan ===
A 2022 study in the UK of veterinary data found a life expectancy of 7.39 years, the second lowest of all breeds in the study. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 9.8 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

A 2004 UK survey found the leading cause of death of Bulldogs to be cardiac-related (20%), cancer (18%), and old age (9%).

===Brachycephaly===

The shortened snout and pushed in face of the Bulldog is known as brachycephaly. Brachycephaly results in deformation of the upper airway tract and leads to obstruction of breathing. Effects of brachycephaly are stridor, stertorous breathing, emesis, skin fold dermatitis, brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome, exophthalmos, pharyngeal gag reflex, cyanosis, and laryngeal collapse. Other issues arising from brachycephaly are risk of complications whilst under anaesthesia, and hyperthermia — with the latter caused due to an inability to effectively reduce body temperature via panting. Many airlines ban the breed from flying in the cargo hold due to a high rate of deaths from air pressure interacting poorly with their breathing problems.

===Other conditions===
Statistics from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals indicate that of the 467 Bulldogs tested between 1979 and 2009 (30 years), 73.9% were affected by hip dysplasia, the highest amongst all breeds. Similarly, the breed has the worst score in the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club Hip Dysplasia scoring scheme, although only 22 Bulldogs were tested in the scheme.

A study in England found the Bulldog to have a nearly three times greater risk of patellar luxation, with 2.9% of all Bulldogs having the condition.

In a 1963 UK study, 17% of Bulldogs surveyed had skin fold dermatitis. The breed is also predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

A study by the Royal Veterinary College found that Bulldogs are a much less healthy breed than average, with over twice the odds of being diagnosed with at least one of the common dog disorders investigated in the study.

Over 80% of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother&#x27;s birth canal and to avoid potential breathing problems for the mother during labour.

A British study found demodicosis to be more prevalent in the Bulldog than other breeds. The overall prevalence was 1.5% in the breed compared to the 0.17% rate for all dogs. For dogs aged under 2 years, the prevalence was 3.6% compared to 0.48%.

The Bulldog is one of the two most commonly affected breeds for hiatal hernia.

=== Controversies and legal status ===
In January 2009, after the BBC documentary &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot;, The Kennel Club introduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders. In 2019 the Dutch Kennel Club implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1 km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes. Its temperature and heart rate have to recover after 15 minutes.

In 2014, the Dutch government forbade the breeding of dogs with a snout shorter than a third of the skull, including Bulldogs, a law that it began enforcing in 2019. In 2022, the Oslo District Court made a ruling that banned the breeding of Bulldogs in Norway due to their propensity for developing health problems. In its verdict the court judged that no dog of this breed could be considered healthy, therefore using them for breeding would be a violation of Norway&#x27;s Animal Welfare Act.

== History ==
The first reference to the word &quot;Bulldog&quot; is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: &quot;procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp&quot;. In 1666, English scientist Christopher Merret applied: &quot;Canis pugnax, &quot;a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog&quot;&quot;, as an entry in his &quot;Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum&quot;.
The designation &quot;bull&quot; was applied because of the dog&#x27;s use in the sport of bull-baiting. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling over them. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed, as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. Therefore, the Old English Bulldog had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its &quot;working&quot; days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor Richard Nicolls. Because cornering and leading wild bulls was dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.
Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer Bill George.

In 1864, a group of Bulldog breeders under R. S. Rockstro founded the first Bulldog Club. Three years after its opening the Club ceased to exist, not having organized a single show. The main achievement of the Rockstro Bulldog Club was a detailed description of the Bulldog, known as the Philo-Kuan Standard. Samuel Wickens, treasurer of the club, published this description in 1865 under the pseudonym Philo-Kuan.

On 4 April 1873, The Kennel Club was founded, the first dog breeding club dealing with the registration of purebred dogs and dog breeds. Bulldogs were included in the first volume of the Kennel Club Stud Book, which was presented at the Birmingham Show on 1 December 1874. The first English Bulldog entered into the register was a male dog named Adam, born in 1864.
In March 1875, the third Bulldog Club was founded, which still exists today. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on Oxford Street in London. The founders of the club collected all available information about the breed and its best representatives and developed a new standard for the English Bulldog, which was published on 27 May 1875, the same year they held the first breed show. Since 1878, exhibitions of the club were held annually, except during the Second World War. On 17 May 1894, the Bulldog Club was granted the status of a corporation and since then has carried the official name &quot;The Bulldog Club, Inc.&quot;. It is the oldest mono-breed dog kennel club in the world.

The Bulldog was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1886.

In 1894, the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dock Leaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk . King Orry was reminiscent of the original Bulldogs, lighter-boned and very athletic. Dock Leaf was a smaller and heavier set, more like modern Bulldogs. King Orry was declared the winner that year, finishing the walk while Dock Leaf collapsed and expired. Though today Bulldogs look tough, they cannot perform the job they were originally bred for, as they cannot withstand the rigours of running after and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle.

== Cultural significance ==

Bulldogs are often associated with determination, strength, and courage due to their historical occupation, though the modern-day dog is bred for appearance and friendliness and not suited for significant physical exertion. They are often used as mascots by universities, sports teams, and other organizations. Some of the better-known Bulldog mascots include Georgetown&#x27;s Jack, Butler&#x27;s Blue IV, Yale&#x27;s Handsome Dan, the University of Georgia&#x27;s Uga, Mississippi State&#x27;s Bully, and the United States Marine Corps&#x27; Chesty.

The Bulldog originated in England and has a longstanding association with British culture; the BBC wrote: &quot;To many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination&quot;. During the Second World War, the Prime Minister Winston Churchill was likened to a Bulldog for his defiance of Nazi Germany.

<text>Backyard Baseball is a series of baseball video games for children which was originally developed by Humongous Entertainment. It was first released in October 1997 for Macintosh and Microsoft Windows. Later games were featured on Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Wii, and iOS. It is part of the &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; series, of which this series serves as its first sub-series. 

The original game consisted of 30 neighborhood kids from which the player must build a team. Over the years, the idea of &quot;Pro players as kids&quot; became popular, and the original statistics and looks of the players changed. As the game progresses, there are some professionals that become available or &quot;unlockable&quot; including Randy Johnson, Derek Jeter, and Mike Piazza.

In &quot;Backyard Baseball&quot;, players take a managerial role by creating a team of different players to compete against opponents. In the different installments, one could choose to play a one-off exhibition game or a seasonal league, followed by the &quot;Backyard Baseball League&quot; playoffs, which contains the American League and National League division series, the AL and NL championship series and finally the &quot;Backyard Baseball World Series&quot;. Series games will vary per game.

This game has various playable modes, and they include: Single Game, Batting Practice, Spectator, and Season Game.

A remastered version of the first &quot;Backyard Baseball&quot; title was released on October 10, 2024, with a remastered version of &quot;Backyard Baseball 2001&quot; planned to release on a later date.

==Legacy==
Pablo Sanchez, one of the fictional playable characters in the game, has been regarded as one of the strongest athletes in video game history.

The game has also been noted for its diversity (gender, race, disability, etc.) of characters, both in ratio of white to non-white and male to female, as well as skill level and the distribution of the best characters.

===Players===
In &quot;Backyard Baseball 2001&quot;, in addition to the 30 fictional kids, each team was represented by at least one MLB pro player, many of which were all-stars during the 1999 Major League Baseball All Star Game. Eventual Hall of Fame players featured include Barry Larkin, Vladimir Guerrero, Jeff Bagwell, Larry Walker, Chipper Jones, Derek Jeter, Mike Piazza, Tony Gwynn, Ken Griffey Jr., Cal Ripken Jr., Ivan Rodriguez, and Randy Johnson, who are all playable characters to choose from.

Other professional players from the later games included Chipper Jones, Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano, Ichiro Suzuki, Sammy Sosa, Jim Thome, Albert Pujols, Nomar Garciaparra, Ken Griffey Jr., and Barry Bonds.

Several of these players would be featured in multiple releases including Nomar Garciaparra, Derek Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez.

<doc id="242070" wikidata="Q420840" url="?curid=242070" title="Asian green bee-eater">
<text>The Asian green bee-eater (Merops orientalis), also known as little green bee-eater, and green bee-eater in Sri Lanka, is a near passerine bird in the bee-eater family. It is resident but prone to seasonal movements and is found widely distributed across Asia from coastal southern Iran east through the Indian subcontinent to Vietnam. Populations in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula that were formerly assigned to this species (under the name green bee-eater) are now considered distinct species: the African green bee-eater and the Arabian green bee-eater. They are mainly insect eaters and they are found in grassland, thin scrub and forest often quite far from water. Several regional plumage variations are known and several subspecies have been named.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
The Asian green bee-eater was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 using its current binomial name. Several populations have been designated as subspecies:
* &quot;M. o. beludschicus&quot; (=&quot;M. o. biludschicus&quot;) Iran to Pakistan (paler colours with a blue throat)
* &quot;M. o. orientalis&quot; in India and Sri Lanka (has head and neck tinged with rufous). 
* &quot;M. o. ferrugeiceps&quot; (=&quot;birmanus&quot;) in northeastern India, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam (has rufous crown, mane and mantle). 
* &quot;M. o. ceylonicus&quot; in Sri Lanka has the nape and hindneck with more pronounced golden brown sheen often included within the nominate race
The African green bee-eater (&quot;M. viridissimus&quot;, along with its subspecies &quot;M. v. viridissimus, M. v. cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;M. v. flavoviridis&quot;) and Arabian green bee-eater (&quot;M. cyanophrys&quot;, along with its subspecies &quot;M. c. cyanophrys&quot; and &quot;M. c. muscatensis&quot;) were formerly considered conspecific, but were split as distinct species by the IOC in 2021.

A study of species within the genus &quot;Merops&quot; based on plumage characteristics found that most of the subspecies of &quot;M. o. orientalis&quot; grouping together with the most similar species being &quot;Merops leschenaulti&quot; and subspecies &quot;M. o. ferrugeiceps&quot; appeared closer to that group.

== Description ==

Like other bee-eaters, this species is a richly coloured, slender bird. It is about long with about made up by the elongated central tail-feathers. The sexes are not visually distinguishable. The entire plumage is bright green and tinged with blue especially on the chin and throat. The crown and upper back are tinged with golden rufous. The flight feathers are rufous washed with green and tipped with blackish. A fine black line runs in front of and behind the eye. The iris is crimson and the bill is black while the legs are dark grey. The feet are weak with the three toes joined at the base. Southeast Asian birds have rufous crown and face, and green underparts, whereas Arabian &quot;beludschicus&quot; has a green crown, blue face and bluish underparts. The wings are green and the beak is black. The elongated tail feathers are absent in juveniles. Sexes are alike.

The calls is a nasal trill &quot;tree-tree-tree-tree&quot;, usually given in flight.

Leucistic individuals have been noted.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This is an abundant and fairly tame bird, familiar throughout its range. It is a bird which breeds in open country with bushes. In Africa and Arabia it is found in arid areas, but is more diverse in its habitats further east. This species often hunts from low perches, maybe only a metre or less high. It readily makes use of fence wires and electric wires. Unlike some other bee-eaters, they can be found well away from water.

They are mostly seen in the plains but can sometimes be found up to in the Himalayas. They are resident in the lowlands of South Asia but some populations move seasonally but the patterns are not clear, moving away to drier regions in the rainy season and to warmer regions in winter. In parts of Pakistan, they are summer visitors.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Like other species in the genus, bee-eaters predominantly eat insects, especially bees, wasps and ants, which are caught in the air by sorties from an open perch. Before swallowing prey, a bee-eater removes stings and breaks the exoskeleton of the prey by repeatedly thrashing it on the perch. Migration is not known but they make seasonal movements in response to rainfall. These birds are somewhat sluggish in the mornings and may be found huddled next to each other on wires sometimes with their bills tucked in their backs well after sunrise. They sand-bathe more frequently than other bee-eater species and will sometimes bathe in water by dipping into water in flight. They are usually seen in small groups and often roost communally in large numbers (200–300). The birds move excitedly at the roost site and call loudly, often explosively dispersing before settling back to the roost tree.
The little green bee-eater is also becoming common in urban and sub-urban neighborhoods, and has been observed perching on television antennae, only to launch into a brief, zig-zag flight formation to catch an insect, then return to the same perch and consume the meal. This behaviour is generally observed between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00am, and after 4:00pm.

The breeding season is from March to June. Unlike many bee-eaters, these are often solitary nesters, making a tunnel in a sandy bank. The breeding pairs are often joined by helpers. They nest in hollows in vertical mud banks. The nest tunnel that they construct can run as much as long and the 3–5 eggs are laid on the bare ground in the cavity at the end of the tunnel. The eggs are very spherical and glossy white. Clutch size varies with rainfall and insect food density. Both sexes incubate. The eggs hatch asynchronously with an incubation period of about 14 days and the chicks grow fledge in 3 to 4 weeks and in the fledging stage show a reduction in body weight. A study suggested that green bee-eaters may be capable of interpreting the behaviour of human observers. They showed an ability to predict whether a human at a particular location would be capable of spotting the nest entrance and then behaved appropriately to avoid giving away the nest location. The ability to look at a situation from another&#x27;s point of view was previously believed to be possessed only by primates.

Riverside habitats were found to support high populations in southern India () dropping off to in agricultural areas and near human habitations.

They feed on flying insects and can sometimes be nuisance to bee-keepers. The preferred prey was mostly beetles followed by hymenopterans. Orthopterans appear to be avoided. They are sometimes known to take crabs. Like most other birds they regurgitate the hard parts of their prey as pellets.

An endoparasitic nematode (&quot;Torquatoides balanocephala&quot;) sometimes infects their gizzard. A protozoal parasite in their blood, &quot;Haemoproteus manwelli&quot;, has been described from India.

<text>Philetus Walter Norris (August 17, 1821 – January 14, 1885) was an American pioneer, businessman, Union Army officer and politician who was the second superintendent of Yellowstone National Park and was the first person to be paid for that position. He fought in the Civil War, served as a spy behind Confederate lines, and rose to the rank of colonel. He was elected to the Ohio Legislature and founded the town of Norris in Wayne County (now within Detroit), where he ran a real estate business. Mount Norris in Yellowstone is named after him.

== Early life ==
Philetus Walter Norris was born in Palmyra, New York on August 17, 1821, the son of John Norris, Jr. and Azubah Phelps. His father was a pioneer mill-builder, and had fought in the War of 1812. In the early 1820s, the family moved to Allegheny County in New York. In 1826, they bought in Michigan, moving there soon thereafter. There, they survived through the Black Hawk War and several cholera plagues. John Norris fell ill, and Philetus was forced to help his mother support their rather large family.

== Pre-Yellowstone years ==
Norris left school early to become a trapper. He traveled all around the midwest to trap and trade. In 1838, Norris settled in northwest Ohio near the home of a good friend. In 1845, Norris married Jane K. Cottrell of Fayette, Ohio. Once married, the couple became two of the original settlers of Pioneer, Ohio. They had four children: Edward, Aurelia, Ida and Arthur. In Pioneer, Norris built a steam mill and worked as a land agent. In the span between 1850 and 1860, Norris also travelled to the western states.

When the Civil War began, Norris joined the Union troops, eventually rising to the rank of Colonel. He served as a spy behind Confederate Lines and Captain of the West Virginia Mountain Scouts. While fighting near Laurel Mountain, West Virginia, Norris&#x27;s horse was shot out from underneath him, severely injuring his shoulder and spinal cord.

After his injury, Norris returned to Pioneer and was elected to the Ohio Legislature. Later, he became a member of the United States Sanitary Commission, caring for the wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and also served at the Confederate prison on Kelley&#x27;s Island.

After the Civil War, Norris moved to Michigan, where he managed land which belonged to officers and soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies as part of a federal contract. In 1873, he founded the town of Norris, now within the boundaries of Detroit but then in Wayne County and built the Two Way Inn, which was originally the village&#x27;s jail and general store. He lived there for a few years until he built a nearby house, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. There he ran a real estate business.

To ensure the success of his community, Norris drained the creek that ran through the area to open up land for farming. He also recruited the railroad to run through the area and maintained the plank road that ran between Detroit and Mount Clemens, operating a tollbooth located in the village.

In 1870, Norris again traveled west, entering the Yellowstone Park area; he returned again in 1875. During this time, Norris wrote a series of articles on &quot;The Great West&quot; which were published in the Norris, Michigan &quot;Suburban&quot;.

== Yellowstone ==
In 1877, Norris became the second superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, a position he held until 1882. It was only in June 1878, however, that Congress finally approved a salary of $10,000 a year for the park&#x27;s superintendent, as well as minimal funds &quot;to protect, preserve, and improve the Park.&quot; Norris hired Harry Yount to control poaching and vandalism in the park, leading Yount to be considered the first National Park ranger.

When Norris arrived in 1877 there were approximately 32 miles (51 km) of roads and 108 miles (173 km) of trails. By the time he left in 1882, there were five times as many roads and twice as many trails. The roads were crude and many described them as only &quot;fair&quot; wagon trails. Still, they provided access to &quot;the land of wonders.&quot;

While superintendent, Norris published five annual reports. Three mountain peaks, including Mount Norris, one geyser basin, and one pass in Yellowstone are named after Norris.

== Afterward ==
Norris was removed from his post at Yellowstone in 1882 due to political maneuvering. In 1883, he published a volume of verse entitled, &quot;The calumet of the Coteau, and other poetical legends of the border. Also, a glossary of Indian names, words and western provincialisms. Together with a guide-book of the Yellowstone national park.&quot;

Afterward, he worked in ethnological research for the Smithsonian Institution. In 1885, Norris fell ill in Rocky Hill, Kentucky, while working for the Smithsonian. After a brief illness, he died in Rocky Hill, on January 14, 1885. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit three days later, and shortly thereafter his body was moved to Woodmere Cemetery.

<text>Harry S. Yount (March 18, 1839May 16, 1924) was an American Civil War soldier, mountain man, professional hunter and trapper, prospector, wilderness guide and packer, seasonal employee of the United States Department of the Interior, and the first game warden in Yellowstone National Park. He was nicknamed &quot;Rocky Mountain Harry Yount&quot;.

Yount served two terms in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He first enlisted for a six-month term in November 1861. He was wounded and taken prisoner by the Confederate States Army in an opening skirmish of the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas in March 1862, and held as a prisoner of war for nearly a month until released in a prisoner exchange. He re-enlisted in August 1862 and served until the end of the war. He was promoted three times and was a company quartermaster sergeant when he was discharged in July 1865.

He worked as a hunter and a prospector, and as a bullwhacker for the U.S. Army, in the years following the Civil War. For seven years in the 1870s he worked as a guide, hunter and wrangler for the expeditions of the Hayden Geological Surveys, which mapped vast areas of the Rocky Mountains.

In 1880, Yount was hired by the United States Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, to be the first gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park, and during his 14 months in that job wrote two annual reports for Schurz, which were then submitted to Congress. His reports described the challenges of protecting the wildlife in the first U.S. national park and influenced the culture of the National Park Service, which was founded 35 years later in 1916. Horace Albright, the second director of the National Park Service, called Yount the &quot;father of the ranger service, as well as the first national park ranger&quot;. Yount was a prospector during much of the last four decades of his life.

== Family background and early years ==

Harry Yount&#x27;s paternal ancestors, Hans George Jundt and Anna Marie Jundt, arrived in Philadelphia in 1731, immigrants from Alsace-Lorraine. Their son, Johannes or John Yount, later moved to Lincoln County, North Carolina. Their grandson, Harry&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Jacob A Yount, moved to present day Missouri with several other families shortly after the Louisiana Purchase. Harry&#x27;s parents were David Yount (1795–1881) and Catherine Shell Yount. Harry Yount&#x27;s father, David Yount, was about 44 years old at the time of Harry&#x27;s birth, and Harry was the couple&#x27;s tenth child.

Harry Yount&#x27;s uncle, George C. Yount, was a trapper and explorer who moved on from Missouri to Santa Fe and then to California before Harry&#x27;s birth. In the 1830s, George C. Yount became the first citizen of the United States to settle in Napa Valley in California, which was then Mexican territory. The town of Yountville, California, is named after him. Two of Harry&#x27;s older brothers, Caleb and John Yount, also moved to the Napa Valley years later.

There are conflicting accounts of Harry Yount&#x27;s place and date of birth. Ernest Ingersoll wrote that he was born in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, and different birth years have been mentioned by various writers, such as the anonymous author of a published biographical sketch who wrote that Yount was born in 1847, and Thomas J. Bryant, who interviewed Yount in the latter years of his life and who speculated that 1837 was his birth date in an article published in the &quot;Annals of Wyoming&quot;, journal of the Wyoming State Historical Society. However, research undertaken by William R. Supernaugh, an employee of the National Park Service, found military enlistment papers, Yount&#x27;s Army pension file, and the 1840 United States census records, all of which indicate that Yount was born on March 18, 1839. These records also show that his legal name was Henry S. Yount. His lifelong nickname was &quot;Harry&quot;, and his middle name is unknown.

Although Yount&#x27;s place of birth is uncertain, Supernaugh concludes it is highly unlikely he was born in Pennsylvania, but rather in Harmony Township, Washington County, Missouri, because the 1840 census shows his father living there with a baby son. Henry was listed as 11 years old in the 1850 census. Harmony Township is a rural area about southwest of St. Louis.

== Civil War military service ==

Yount enlisted in the Union Army for a six-month term on November 9, 1861, and served in Company F of Phelps&#x27; Regiment of the Missouri Infantry. John S. Phelps was his commanding general. Yount was wounded in the leg in a skirmish just before the Battle of Pea Ridge began on March 6, 1862, and taken prisoner by the Confederates. As a captive, he was marched more than to Fort Smith in his bare feet on cold, wet roads, and was held there as a POW for 28 days before his release in a prisoner exchange. He was discharged from the Union Army in May 1862.

Yount re-enlisted in Lebanon, Missouri, on August 9, 1862, and served as a private in Company H of the 8th Regiment Missouri Volunteer Cavalry, a unit involved in 11 combat engagements during his service. On April 14, 1863, he was promoted to corporal and then to sergeant on December 9, 1863; he became company quartermaster sergeant on June 13, 1864. He was discharged in Little Rock, Arkansas, on July 20, 1865, after the war had ended.

As a result of his barefoot march to captivity, Yount developed rheumatism in both feet. When the Dependent and Disability Pension Act passed in 1890, he became eligible for a monthly partial disability pension of $6 in 1892, which was raised to $12 a month in 1900 and $25 in 1912. Yount was later an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic, the post-war organization of veterans of the Union Army.

== Bullwhacker, hunter and trapper ==

After the Civil War ended, Yount became engaged to Estella Braun, a Western Union employee in Detroit, Michigan. She was killed in a train wreck before their wedding could take place, and he never married. Yount traveled to Fort Kearny, along the Oregon Trail in Nebraska. There he was hired as an Army bullwhacker, transporting supplies by wagon along the Bozeman Trail between Fort Laramie in modern-day Wyoming and Fort C.F. Smith in modern-day Montana. There was conflict with Native Americans in this region in those years, and Yount fought against Cheyenne and Sioux warriors several times while on the trail. In one incident, his ox wagon was harassed for four days by a party of Sioux warriors, until he fired his carbine at one warrior, hitting and probably killing the warrior&#x27;s horse. Supernaugh comments that Yount believed that Indians would kill him if they could, but that he did not &quot;blame the Indians for defending what was their country originally.&quot; Yount also worked as a buffalo hunter during this period. He sold buffalo tongues for $1 each to tourists in Cheyenne. Yount believed that &quot;it was a pity to kill off the buffaloes, which were here in immense numbers, but it was the only way to get rid of the Indians, as the buffalo were their main source of subsistence.&quot;

The Smithsonian Institution engaged Yount&#x27;s services to collect specimens of animals for taxidermy display in the early 1870s. Because he was successful in this first assignment, Spencer F. Baird of the Smithsonian again retained Yount&#x27;s services in 1875 to collect specimens of many species of Rocky Mountain mammals. It is likely that many of these were displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, as extant photos of the exhibit halls show similar specimens. During those years, Yount also began his long career as prospector, achieving some success.

In 1877, Yount was the subject of a magazine profile written by Ernest Ingersoll and published in &quot;Appleton&#x27;s Journal&quot; in New York. Ingersoll described Yount&#x27;s expertise as a hunter, including a story that he once killed 70 antelope in one day during a competition with another hunter, but that Yount was ashamed of the accomplishment because &quot;it went against his heart to kill so many innocent creatures just for the glory.&quot;

Yount would fill a wagon full of freshly killed game, and then sell the meat in towns such as Laramie and Cheyenne. According to Ingersoll, Yount was quite careful about his personal appearance: &quot;his belt, holster, knife-sheath, bridle, and saddle are all set off with a barbaric glitter.&quot; Yount paid a Shoshone woman to decorate his buckskin jacket, &quot;a marvel of fringes, fur trimming and intricate embroidery of beads.&quot; Ingersoll wrote that Yount was &quot;by nature a gentleman, and under his sinewy frame and tireless strength, there is a heart as tender as a girl&#x27;s, which hates the cruelty his profession unavoidably occasions. His eye is open to every beautiful feature of the grand world in which he lives; his heart is alive to all the gentle influences of the original wilderness.&quot; Ingersoll&#x27;s 1883 book, &quot;Knocking &#x27;Round the Rockies&quot;, describes Yount in a similar fashion.

== Guide for the Hayden Geological Survey ==

In 1872 or 1873, Yount was hired as a seasonal guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad swaths of the Rocky Mountains. The Hayden Survey, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and funded by the Department of the Interior, was one of several regional survey projects that were combined to form the United States Geological Survey in 1879. Hayden had been one of the leading advocates for the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872.

Yount worked for Hayden&#x27;s expeditions each summer for seven years during the 1870s, in what are now the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Wyoming and Colorado. Each winter during the period, Yount would hunt and trap in the Laramie Range in Wyoming.

In 1874, Yount was assigned to hunt for a party led by the geologist Archibald Marvine. Yount was later charged by a &quot;huge&quot; grizzly bear, and fired four gunshots – one through the skull, two through the flanks, and a final shot into the heart – before the bear was brought down.

During Hayden&#x27;s expedition of 1877, Yount engaged in mountaineering with Ingersoll and the cartographer A. D. Wilson in the Wind River Range. They were the first to ascend the south slopes of Wind River Peak, and, with Wilson, Yount was the first to ascend West Atlantic Peak. Hayden&#x27;s expedition of 1878 conducted surveys in Yellowstone National Park and surrounding areas in 1878. That expedition included the British mountaineer James Eccles and Eccles&#x27;s favorite Swiss mountain guide, Michel Payot of Chamonix. Eccles wanted to attempt an ascent of the Grand Teton, then unclimbed. This was the third attempt to climb the Grand Teton by members of Hayden&#x27;s expeditions. Yount served as the guide in a four-man party that included Eccles, Payot and Wilson. Eccles and Payot were held up by the disappearance of two mules carrying their gear, and so were unable to accompany Wilson and Yount on to the higher parts of the mountain. During the climb, Yount slipped on the ice and fell close to a deep chasm in the glacier, where water was streaming down from the cliff above. The hold of his buckskin pants on the ice reportedly prevented him from being carried down into the crevice. Wilson was quoted as saying that Yount was clinging to the rock like &quot;a starfish hanging to a breakwater,&quot; and that he himself lowered a rope to assist Yount. Because of the delay and the absence of the experienced Alpine climbers, Yount and Wilson had to turn back a few hundred feet short of the summit, at a spur called The Enclosure. No previous party had come so close to reaching the summit. The undisputed first ascent of the Grand Teton took place 20 years later, in 1898.

== Gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park ==

Yount was hired as the first gamekeeper for Yellowstone National Park in 1880, at a salary of $1,000 per year, when the park&#x27;s entire budget was just $15,000 per year. He was appointed by Carl Schurz, the Secretary of the Interior and a former Union Army general, on June 21, 1880, and reported for duty at Yellowstone on July 6. His supervisor was Philetus Norris, the second park superintendent. Shortly after Yount reported for duty, Yount escorted Schurz and his party on a tour of the park, and then conducted a survey of the park&#x27;s wildlife. Yount began constructing a winter camp at the junction of the East Fork of the Yellowstone River and Soda Butte Valley, a location he chose because it allowed for the protection of herds of buffalo and elk against poachers.

Yount submitted his first &quot;Report of Gamekeeper&quot; on November 25, 1880, which was included as Appendix A to the annual report of the Secretary of the Interior. His report described his activities since being hired. He recommended:
In his report of September 30, 1881, Yount described how he spent the unusually severe winter of 1880–1881, and his efforts to prevent poaching by tourists and Indians, while still hunting to provide food for the park staff. Yount reported that snow had fallen on 66 of 90 days between December 1880 and February 1881. He described the range and habits of Yellowstone&#x27;s large mammals and expressed regret for &quot;the unfortunate breakage of my thermometer when it could not be replaced,&quot; along with a submitted synopsis of the weather the previous winter. In this report, he resigned his position &quot;to resume private enterprises now requiring my personal attention,&quot; and concluded with a clear recommendation:

There are indications that Yount had a difference of opinion with park superintendent Norris, who wanted him to spend more of his time building roads for the convenience of tourists, while Yount preferred to concentrate on protecting the wildlife.

== Recognition as first National Park ranger ==

Although Yount&#x27;s official job title was &quot;gamekeeper&quot; rather than &quot;park ranger&quot;, and although he only worked in Yellowstone National Park for 14 months, his two annual reports had a lasting impact on the administration of the national parks in the United States. He is &quot;securely positioned in the legend and culture&quot; of the National Park Service, and is considered a figure of &quot;historic proportion&quot;. In &quot;Oh, Ranger!&quot;, a book published in 1928, Horace Albright, who later became the second director of the National Park Service, wrote that &quot;Harry Yount pointed out in a report that it was impossible for one man to patrol the park. He urged the formation of a ranger force. So Harry Yount is credited with being the father of the ranger service, as well as the first US Park Ranger.&quot; Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, wrote the foreword of the book.

== Prospecting and later years ==

After Yount resigned from his job in Yellowstone, he lived for a while in Uva, Wyoming. He homesteaded in the area in 1887 but his claim was sold in a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1892. He spent nearly 40 years prospecting in the Laramie Mountains, and developed copper and graphite mining claims. He settled in Wheatland, Wyoming, and worked on developing a marble mining claim west of there. Yount was actively involved in prospecting until the day before his death, when he had been looking for a ride to inspect a possible gold deposit. On May 16, 1924, he walked into downtown Wheatland, as was his daily habit, where he collapsed and died of heart failure near a Lutheran church. He was buried in the Lakeview Cemetery in Cheyenne.

== Legacy ==

Younts Peak, which is high and located in the Absaroka Range at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, is named after Yount. The peak&#x27;s name was bestowed by the Hayden Geological Survey. Long after his death, in the 1970s, Yount&#x27;s marble mining claim finally went into production. It yielded crushed marble for use in landscaping and aquariums.

In 1994, the National Park Service established the Harry Yount Award, given annually to an employee whose &quot;overall impact, record of accomplishments, and excellence in traditional ranger duties have created an appreciation for the park ranger profession.&quot; This award is given both nationally and regionally. According to Supernaugh, Yount is &quot;credited with setting the standards for performance and service by which the public has come to judge the rangers of today&quot;.

<text>Kmart ( ), formerly legally registered as Kmart Corporation, now operated by Transformco, is a department store chain, and a current online retailer in the United States and its territories. It operates four remaining Kmart big-box department stores — three in the US Virgin Islands and one in Tamuning, Guam. The company closed its last big-box store in the mainland United States in 2024. A smaller location remains open in the former Garden Shop of its Kendale Lakes, Florida (Miami postal address) store, while the adjoining big box building is occupied by another retail chain that has leased the space.

Before 2018 Kmart owned and operated a much larger chain of Kmart stores. The company is headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States.
The company was incorporated in 1899 as S. S. Kresge Corporation and renamed Kmart Corporation in 1977. The first store with the Kmart name opened in 1962 in Garden City, Michigan. At its peak in 1994, Kmart operated 2,486 stores globally, including 2,323 discount stores and Super Kmart Center locations in the United States. From 2005 through 2019, Kmart was a subsidiary of Sears Holdings Corporation, which owns Sears. Since 2019, Kmart has been a subsidiary of Transform SR Brands LLC, a privately held company that was formed in 2019 to acquire assets from Sears Holdings.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
S. S. Kresge, the founder of the company that would become Kmart, met variety-store pioneer Frank Winfield Woolworth while working as a traveling salesman and selling to all 19 of Woolworth&#x27;s stores at the time. In 1897, Kresge invested $6,700 saved from his job into a five-and-dime store in Memphis, Tennessee. He jointly owned the first store with his former tinware customer, John G. McCrory. Kresge and McCrory added a second store in downtown Detroit the following year. These were the first S.S. Kresge stores. After two years of partnership, he traded McCrory his share in the Memphis store, plus $3,000, for full ownership of the Detroit store, and formed the Kresge &amp; Wilson Company with his brother-in-law, Charles J. Wilson.

In 1912, Kresge incorporated the S.S. Kresge Company in Delaware with 85 stores. In 1916, Kresge incorporated a new S.S. Kresge Company in Michigan and took over the operations of the original company, becoming the modern day Kmart company. The company was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 1918. During World War I, Kresge experimented with raising the limit on prices in his stores to $1. By 1924, Kresge was worth approximately $375 million and owned real estate of the approximate value of $100 million. Growth early in the 20th century remained brisk, with 257 stores in 1924, rising to 597 stores by 1929. Kresge retired as president in 1925, continuing as the company&#x27;s chairman. The Great Depression reduced profitability and resulted in store closings, but the number rose to 682 in 1940. After the war, shopping patterns changed and many customers moved out of the cities into the suburbs.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
Under the leadership of executive Harry Cunningham, S.S. Kresge Company opened the first Kmart-named store, at , which was referred to by Kresge as a &quot;bantam&quot; Kmart and was in fact originally intended to be a Kresge store until late in the planning process, on January 25, 1962, in San Fernando, California, just six months before the first Walmart opened, while the first ground-up full-size Kmart with , opened on March 1, 1962, in Garden City, Michigan. Cunningham and Sam Walton were both inspired by Ann &amp; Hope, which they each visited in 1961. Seventeen more Kmart stores opened in 1962. Kmart Foods, a now-defunct chain of Kmart supermarkets, opened in that decade. Though the chain continued to open Kmart branded stores, the company was still officially known as S.S. Kresge Company.
Company founder Kresge died on October 18, 1966, at age 99.
Around the time of the opening of the first Kmart, some poorly performing S.S. Kresge stores were converted to a new &quot;Jupiter Discount Stores&quot; brand, which was conceived as a bare-bones, deep discount outfit. During the 1970s, Kmart put a number of competing retailers out of business. Kresge, Jupiter and Kmart stores mainly competed with other store chains like Zayre, Ames, Bradlees, Caldor, Hills, and those that were operated by MMG-McCrory Stores (McCrory, McLellan, H.L. Green, J.J. Newberry, S.H. Kress, TG&amp;Y, Silver&#x27;s and eventually G.C. Murphy Co.). In 1977, S.S. Kresge Company changed its name to K Mart Corporation.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Vice Chairman Bernard M. Fauber was elected as the chairman and as the CEO of Kmart.

In April 1981, the 2,000th Kmart store opened in Kearny, New Jersey which eventually closed in May 2021. By the end of 1981, there were 2,055 Kmart stores across the United States and Canada.

In 1987, the Kmart Corporation sold its remaining 76 Kresge and Jupiter stores in the United States to McCrory Stores, and the brands were almost entirely discontinued, although Canadian Kresge and Jupiter stores continued to operate until 1994.

Kmart experimented with co-branding in 1985, when the in-store cafeteria at the store in Canton, Michigan, was converted to a Wendy&#x27;s.
Until November 1990, when it was passed by Walmart, Kmart was the second-largest retailer in the United States, after Sears. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the corporate office shifted much of its focus from the Kmart stores to other companies it had acquired or created, such as Sports Authority, Builders Square, and Waldenbooks.

=== Blue Light Special ===
The Blue Light Special was a sale promotion within the store for a short period within store hours only. It was advertised using a rotating blue light, in the same style a police car used, and was announced over the store public address system with the phrase &quot;attention Kmart shoppers&quot;, a phrase which became a pop culture reference. The original concept for the Blue Light Special was a limited-time offer to sell slower-moving merchandise. The sale was first introduced in 1965 and was retired in 1991.

Starting in the 2000s, Kmart would repeatedly bring back the Blue Light Special. This was done first in 2001, but was discontinued again in 2002. The sale was briefly revived in 2005, though Kmart at that time had no plans to use the concept long-term. Blue Light Specials were revived again in 2009 on Saturdays, offering surprise hour-long sales on selected merchandise, but they were again discontinued. Blue Light Specials were revived once again in November 2015.

=== 1990–2001: New image ===
In 1990, in an effort to update its image, Kmart introduced a new logo. It dropped the old-style italic &quot;K&quot; with a turquoise &quot;mart&quot; in favor of a red block letter K with the word &quot;mart&quot; written in script and contained inside the &quot;K&quot;. Kmart then began remodeling stores shortly thereafter. This logo was replaced in 2004 with the current logo. In 1990, Little Caesars Pizza opened its first in-store Kmart restaurant in Rochester, Michigan (coincidentally, Little Caesars and Kmart were both founded in Garden City, Michigan, in 1959 and 1962 respectively). In 1995, Kmart also tried to reinvent itself by using the short-lived name Today&#x27;s Kmart.

In 1991, the company revised its name slightly to Kmart Corporation.

In 1992, Kmart entered the Eastern European market with the purchase of 13 stores in the former Czechoslovakia. These stores were sold off in 1996.

The company also began to offer exclusive merchandise by Martha Stewart, Kathy Ireland, Jaclyn Smith, Lauren Hutton, and Thalía. Other recognizable brands included exclusively licensed merchandising of products relating to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and Disney. Actress and television personality Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and actress/director and producer Penny Marshall became among the company&#x27;s most recognized spokespersons.

Super Kmart Center (Super Kmart) opened an all-new location on July 25, 1991, in Medina Township, Ohio, featuring a full-service grocery with a full-service deli, seafood counter and bakery. It also had general merchandise like many Kmarts had. However, this location was downsized in 2011 and was one of a number of Kmarts closed in early 2012 following poor Christmas 2011 sales. The second ground-up Super Kmart Center opened in Copley Township, Ohio, featuring an in-store video rental center, and an in-store carryout Chinese restaurant. This location has also shut down. The last Super Kmart Center in Howland Township, Ohio, closed on April 8, 2018. Besides the Medina and Copley locations, many more Super Kmarts opened nationwide.

Big Kmart opened in Chicago, Illinois, on April 23, 1997. The format focuses on home fashions, children&#x27;s apparel, and consumables (The Pantry). Most Kmart stores were remodeled to this format during the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Initially, this approach was successful and sales numbers had grown by 10 to 15% in the Kmart stores converted to the Big Kmart format. During 1997 and 1998, the company either converted regular Kmart stores into or opened outright 1,245 Big Kmart locations. By 1998, 62% of Kmart&#x27;s stores were Big Kmart locations. In 1998, Kmart acquired 45 former Venture stores and converted them into Big Kmart locations. There were a high of 1,900 Big Kmart stores during the year 2000, compared to about 100 for Super Kmart and another 100 remaining traditional Kmart locations. 

The Sports Authority was acquired by Kmart in 1990 and spun off five years later.
Kmart&#x27;s profitability and sales peaked in 1992, and the later decline is attributed to competition with Walmart, Target, and internet shopping. In 1994, Kmart announced they would close 110 stores. Unlike its competitors Walmart and Target, Kmart failed to invest in computer technology to manage its supply chain. Furthermore, Kmart maintained a high dividend, which reduced the amount of money that was available for improving its stores. Many business analysts also faulted the company for failing to create a coherent brand image.

In September 1995, Kmart sold its money-losing in-store auto repair centers to Penske Corporation for $112 million to operate them as Penske Auto Centers. Penske later closed the auto repair centers in 2002 as a result of a payment dispute with Kmart.

In 1997, Kmart launched the Kmart Cash Card as a replacement for the paper gift certificates and to facilitate the return process.
In July 1999, Kmart hired SuperValu and Fleming to distribute $3.9 billion worth of food and other related products to all Kmart stores.

In 2000, Kmart and Capital One launched an all-new co-branded MasterCard as a replacement for the private label Kmart credit cards.

Also in 2000, Kmart expanded the Martha Stewart Everyday Garden Collection to include live plants and seeds. Kmart also launched the Martha Stewart Everyday Kitchen, which is a complete line of housewares essentials.

In July 2000, Kmart closed 72 underperforming stores, while opening 20 new Big Kmart stores, converting 12 regular Kmart stores into Super Kmart Center stores, and opening 5 new Super Kmart Center stores. The company announced a planned major restructuring, in which Kmart would invest in new customer check-out and new inventory management technology and other related systems.

In 2001, Kmart opened several new Super Kmart stores as part of Kmart&#x27;s plan to expand their Super Kmart Center store portfolio and make groceries available at stores. However, Kmart having filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, the company was unable to open any new Super Kmart Center stores, and construction was halted on others, no matter how close the stores were to completion.

In 2001, Kmart signed a $4.5 billion arrangement with Fleming, making them the sole food and consumables distributor for the company&#x27;s stores.

In February 2001, Japanese video game company Sega sued Kmart for failure to pay $2.2 million of $25.9 million for Dreamcast game systems.

In August 2001, Target sued Kmart because the company&#x27;s &quot;Dare to Compare&quot; advertising campaign inaccurately compared its own prices with those of Target a majority of the time on in-store signs.

=== 2002–2009: Merger with Sears ===
On January 22, 2002, Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the leadership of its then-chairman Charles Conaway and president Mark Schwartz. Conaway, who successfully expanded CVS Corporation, accepted an offer to take the helm at Kmart along with a loan of $5 million (equivalent to $ in 2025). In a scandal similar to that involving Enron, Conaway and Schwartz were accused of misleading shareholders and other company officials about the company&#x27;s financial crisis while making millions and allegedly spending the company&#x27;s money on airplanes, houses, boats and other luxuries. At a conference for Kmart employees on January 22, Conaway accepted &quot;full blame&quot; for the financial disaster. As Kmart emerged from bankruptcy, Conaway was forced to step down, and was asked to pay back all the loans he had taken.

After dismissing Conaway and Schwartz, Kmart closed more than 300 stores in the U.S., including all the locations in Alaska, and laid off around 34,000 workers as part of the restructuring process. Kmart introduced five prototype stores with a new logo, layout, and lime green and gray color scheme, one in White Lake, Michigan, and four in central Illinois: (Peoria, Pekin, Morton and Washington). The new layout was touted as having wider aisles and improved selection and lighting, and the city or town&#x27;s name was featured under the new Kmart logo at the front entrance. However, Kmart could not afford a full-scale rollout. The lime green prototype was abandoned for the new Kmart &quot;Orange&quot; concept that rolled out at several of its locations throughout the United States in 2006.

While Kmart was going through bankruptcy, a significant amount of Kmart&#x27;s outstanding debt was purchased by ESL Investments, a hedge fund controlled by Edward Lampert. Lampert worked to accelerate the bankruptcy process.

On January 13, 2003, Kmart closed 326 stores due to a lack of profitability and poor sales.

On May 6, 2003, Kmart emerged from bankruptcy protection as a subsidiary of the new Kmart Holding Corporation. On June 10, 2003, Kmart began trading on the NASDAQ stock market with the ticker symbol of KMRT with Lampert serving as the chairman and with ESL Investments controlling 53% of the new company for an investment of less than $1 billion. Lampert dismissed his concerns that the smaller company would be at a disadvantage, stating &quot;The focus that a lot of people have in retail revolves around sales, but sales without profit do not allow a business to be successful in the long term.&quot; He began to improve the company&#x27;s balance sheet by reducing inventory, cutting costs, and closing underperforming stores. By the fourth quarter of 2003, Kmart posted its first profitable quarter in three years, although it has since returned to an operating loss.

On July 23, 2004, a new Kmart logo featuring a large red &quot;K&quot; with &quot;kmart&quot; in small block letters underneath it was announced. On August 12, 2004, Kmart and E! Entertainment Television announced a new, exclusive, cross-promotional clothing brand called Attention. Attention was launched as a new clothing brand that would be sold only at Kmart stores and would be used to promote &quot;E! News Live&quot;. Kmart had previously signed a similar deal with the WB Network to have the cast of five WB shows wear Kmart branded clothing during shows.

On November 8, 2004, Kmart launched the Kmart Rewards credit card that is managed by HSBC Bank.

On November 17, 2004, Kmart&#x27;s management announced its intention to purchase Sears for $11 billion. As part of the merger, the Kmart Holding Corporation (the company that owns Kmart) would be transferred to the new Sears Holdings Corporation and Sears would be purchased by the new Sears Holdings Corporation. The new corporation announced that it would continue to operate stores under both the Sears and Kmart brands. Around this time, Kmart changed its logo from a red K with the script &quot;mart&quot; inside, to the same K with the chain&#x27;s name in lowercase letters below it. Kmart&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and in 2012 the sprawling headquarters complex in Troy, Michigan, was acquired by the Forbes Company, which owns the nearby upscale mall, Somerset Collection. No concrete plans for redevelopment of the site had been announced.

In 2005, Sears Holdings Corporation introduced the Sears Essentials store format, which would serve as a Kmart-Sears hybrid. Sears Essentials stores were freestanding (not located at a shopping mall) stores. In 2006, the company discontinued the Sears Essentials name, and renamed all of the Sears Essentials stores as Sears Grand stores.

Kmart started remodeling stores to the &quot;Orange&quot; prototype in 2005. In 2006, the typical white and blue interior of the stores was changed to orange and brown, and shelf heights were lowered to create better sightlines. The remodeled stores contain an appliance department with Kenmore Appliances and most have hardware departments that sell Craftsman tools, which prior to the merger had been exclusive to Sears stores. Some auto centers left vacant by Penske after Kmart filed for bankruptcy had been converted to Sears Auto Centers.

In July 2009, Sears Holdings opened its first Sears-branded appliance store inside a Kmart. The store-within-a-store opened inside the former garden department of a Birmingham, Alabama, Kmart. It was two-thirds the size of the appliance department in most Sears stores, but larger than the appliance department in remodeled Kmart stores.

In October 2009, it was reported that Kmart and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia failed to come to a new agreement. This came after Stewart made remarks on CNBC that her line at Kmart had deteriorated, particularly after the Sears merger.

In November 2009, Kmart reported its first year-over-year sales increase of 0.5% since 2005, and only the second such increase since 2001.

=== 2010–2018: Kmart and Sears Holdings ===
During the 2010s, many of Kmart&#x27;s stores were considered to be outdated and in decaying condition.

On December 27, 2011, Sears Holdings announced that 100 to 120 Sears and Kmart stores would close.

In 2014, news reports indicated that Kmart was liquidating dozens of stores across the United States. Kmart&#x27;s parent company, Sears Holdings Corporation, underwent financial distress throughout the year, sparking an unspecified number of closings of Sears and Kmart locations amid vendors&#x27; and lenders&#x27; concerns about its liquidity. Along with store closings, measures included the spinning off its Lands&#x27; End division, selling most of its stake in Sears Canada, issuing debt and taking on loans that cumulatively put it on track to raise $1.445 billion in cash in 2014. Howard Riefs, a company spokesman who has often spoken on behalf of Kmart, said, &quot;Store closures are part of a series of actions we&#x27;re taking to reduce on-going expenses, adjust our asset base and accelerate the transformation of our business model.&quot;

On October 10, 2014, Kmart was a victim of a data breach concerning customers&#x27; credit and debit card information. On October 19, Kmart stated, &quot;Based on the forensic investigation to date, no personal information, no debit card PIN numbers, no email addresses and no social security numbers were obtained by those criminally responsible. There is also no evidence that kmart.com customers were impacted. This data breach has been contained and the malware has been removed. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our members and customers.&quot;

In April 2016, Kmart announced that it was liquidating 68 stores. The chain announced in September 2016 that 64 more stores in 28 states would close by mid-December 2016. Sears Holdings CEO Eddie Lampert stated in October 2016 that there were not and never had been plans to close the Kmart format and that they are working hard to make it a &quot;more fun, engaging place to shop, powered by our integrated retail innovations and Shop Your Way&quot;. In December 2016, at least 25 Kmart locations were targeted for closure in early 2017.
In January 2017, Kmart announced that 78 more stores would close. Financial analysts began warning that the fate of Sears Holdings was nearing its end. In May 2017, Kmart announced the upcoming closure of 18 more stores. Sears Holdings admitted uncertainty regarding the survival of both Sears and Kmart. In early June 2017, Kmart announced that an additional 49 stores across the U.S. were to be shuttered by September 2017. In early July 2017, Kmart had announced that 35 more stores would close by early October 2017. In late August 2017, Kmart announced another 28 store closures, including the last Rhode Island location, in Cranston. On October 9, 2017, with no closing sale held, the Kmart store in Santa Rosa, California, was destroyed by the Tubbs Fire, adding to the list of closed stores. On October 17, 2017, Kmart announced the liquidation of an unspecified number of locations by late November. On November 3, 2017, it was announced that a further 45 Kmarts (along with 18 Sears stores) were to close, effective by January 2018, including Kmart&#x27;s last store in Alabama, in Albertville.
According to Fortune.com, Kmart and Sears did not run any television advertisements during the 2017 holiday season in order to focus on digital marketing after evaluating the effectiveness of its various marketing efforts.

On January 4, 2018, after yet another disappointing holiday sales season, Kmart announced the liquidation of 64 more stores in the spring of 2018. This included Kmart&#x27;s only remaining Super Kmart location in Warren, Ohio, which officially discontinued the Super Kmart format. According to MSN Money, Kmart along with sister company Sears had an extremely high chance of disappearing in 2018, such that 2017 would have marked its final holiday season as an independent brand.

On March 15, 2018, Sears Holdings announced that a small profit was made in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, investors claimed that it was due to tax refunds and that sales were still falling for both Kmart and Sears. On March 26, 2018, CEO Eddie Lampert said, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure Kmart on its own could ever be a great retailer,&quot; implying that the company was trying to shift to online shopping as opposed to brick and mortar stores. On April 12, 2018, Sears announced plans to close and auction 16 of its Sears stores, and close several more Kmart locations, but did not specify how many. Two known locations on the list were Kmart stores in Brandon, Florida, and Saugus, Massachusetts. In early May, Sears announced the liquidation of several more Kmarts, including the last Kmart in Vermont, in Bennington.
On May 21, 2018, Sears Holdings announced yet another round of liquidation sales in forty Sears and Kmart stores across 24 states. These stores were closed by July 4, 2018. On May 31, Sears Holdings announced the liquidation of an additional 16 Kmart stores and 48 Sears stores, including the last Kmart in Hawaii, in Līhue. The closings announced May 31, 2018, were from among 100 unprofitable stores in Sears Holdings and the remaining 28 unprofitable stores were, &quot;a small group of stores that was pulled from the closing list ... as they are being evaluated further,&quot; meaning even more store closings could occur later in the year. Sears Holdings did not disclose those locations at the time. On June 28, 2018, Sears Holdings disclosed 10 of the stores being evaluated and announced they would close by September 2018. Liquidation sales began on the same day. On July 13, 2018, news came through from multiple sources that even more Kmart stores were set to liquidate across the nation. On August 23, 2018, it was announced that 13 more stores would close by November.

=== 2018–2019: Second bankruptcy ===
On October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that it would close 142 stores, including 63 Kmart stores, which included the last Kmart in Arkansas, in Russellville, the last two Kmarts in Georgia, in Covington and Peachtree City, and the last two Kmarts in Kansas, in Kansas City and Salina. Sears Holdings&#x27; bankruptcy also marked Kmart&#x27;s second bankruptcy in 16 years. On November 8, 2018, Sears Holdings announced it would close an additional 40 stores, including 11 Kmart stores. On November 23, 2018, Sears Holdings released a list of 505 stores, including 239 Kmart stores, to be presented for sale in the bankruptcy process while all other stores were holding liquidation sales. However, the stores for sale were not guaranteed to be protected from liquidation in the future. On December 28, 2018, Sears Holdings announced it would close 80 additional stores, including 37 Kmart stores.

In a proposal announced in early January, Sears Holdings planned only to keep 202 Kmart stores along with 223 Sears stores open, assuming that it would survive the bankruptcy process. Most of the proposed locations were in highly populated coastal regions.
On January 15, 2019, when it had appeared that Kmart&#x27;s parent, Sears Holdings, was preparing to file for Chapter 7 liquidation, the bankruptcy court judge ordered the company to return to the negotiating table and work out a new deal with Eddie Lampert to prevent the liquidation from occurring. A new deal was struck at the last minute that would keep up to 400 Sears and Kmart stores operating. On January 19, 2019, Sears Holdings officially announced that they had won the auction, and that some of the then existing stores were to remain open.

On January 24, 2019, a group of unsecured creditors, which included Simon Property Group, filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to overturn the deal Sears Holdings had recently made with Lampert, claiming Lampert had been &quot;engaged in serial asset stripping&quot; of the company at the expense of suppliers and landlords. The creditors had requested that the bankruptcy court rule to liquidate the company instead of allowing reorganization so that the creditors would be able to recover more money that was still owed to them. On January 28, the federal government-operated Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation announced that they were not in favor of Sears Holdings&#x27; current agreement with Lampert since that agreement would create a $1.7 billion funding gap in the employee pension fund, requiring American taxpayers to cover the shortfall. In papers filed on February 1 with the bankruptcy court, ESL &quot;outlined plans to close three Kmart stores per month in 2019&quot; if the court would decide to accept ESL&#x27;s purchase bid.

In February 2019, it was announced that a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved the sale of the most lucrative part of Sears Holdings to Edward Lampert, allowing the surviving part of the company that operated both Sears and Kmart to remain in business at the expense of suppliers, landlords, employees, pensioners, the U.S. government, and other creditors. Kmart would have 202 locations after the sale was to be completed.

=== 2019–present: New management and exit from the U.S. market ===

The sale of 202 Kmart stores to Transform Holdco was finalized in February 2019, with the remaining Kmart locations liquidated to partially pay off Sears Holdings creditors.

In May 2019, it was revealed that Kmart would close its store in Walla Walla, Washington in July. On August 6, 2019, TransformCo announced plans to close five additional stores by October 2019. At the time of the announcement, TransformCo also added that it &quot;cannot rule out additional store closures in the near term&quot;. Between August 5 and 23, 2019, it was later announced that four more Kmarts would close. In late 2019, the closure of 120 Kmart stores was announced. In November 2019, Kmart announced the closing of 45 stores in February 2020. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Transformco &quot;would continue to evaluate its retail footprint, suggesting that additional closures are possible&quot;. On February 6, 2020, Kmart announced it would close 15 more stores. On November 21, 2021, Kmart closed its last store in Michigan, the state where the chain originated in 1962.

By April 2022, only three locations remained in the continental United States: in Miami, Florida; Westwood, New Jersey; and Bridgehampton, New York. In October 2023, the Westwood location closed after more than 40 years in business, having opened in the fall of 1982. This reduced the chain to two mainland U.S. stores in addition to the three remaining US. Virgin Islands locations and one in Guam.

The Bridgehampton, New York location closed on October 20, 2024. It had opened in 1999 in the place of a former Caldor store and was able to outlive other Kmart locations due to limited competition from Walmart and Target which were both a 45-minute drive away. The closure left the Miami store as the sole Kmart location in the continental U.S., with 4 others remaining in U.S. territories. Unlike the location that closed in Bridgehampton, the one in Miami is not a full-line Kmart store. The Kmart location in Miami had been downsized in March 2023 and is now largely operating out of its former garden center, offering a limited selection of clothing, appliances, and household goods; the rest of the store&#x27;s original space is leased to an At Home outlet. This Kmart store, located in the Kendale Lakes area, inaugurated on November 3, 1977.

=== Headquarters ===
The owner of Kmart, Transform Holdco LLC, had its headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, just outside of Chicago since 1993 when it moved out of the Sears Tower in downtown Chicago. Kmart&#x27;s headquarters had been in Hoffman Estates since Kmart bought Sears in 2005, but in December 2021, Transformco announced that it intended to put its corporate headquarters and 120 surrounding acres in the Northwest suburb on the market at the start of the new year.

The headquarters were formerly located in the Kmart International Headquarters at 3100 W. Big Beaver Road in Troy, Michigan, in Metro Detroit. The facility had 23 interconnected modules. Each had three stories, except for one module, which was one story. Based on the layout, Norm Sinclair of &quot;DBusiness&quot; concluded that it was &quot;a study in inefficiency&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
Kmart for Kids was the umbrella program for Kmart&#x27;s philanthropic initiatives. The program had helped children across the country live happier, healthier lives through the support of: March of Dimes, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, and American Diabetes Association.
At one time, Kmart was March of Dimes&#x27; number one corporate sponsor, having raised $114 million for the charity over more than 30 years.

On July 29, 2008, Don Germano, SVP/GM of Kmart stores, was elected to a five-year term on the national Board of Trustees of the March of Dimes Foundation.

Kmart for Kids had supported St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital through its annual Thanks and Giving campaign, an opportunity for Kmart customers to give thanks for the healthy children in their lives and give to help those who are not. Kmart had been a partner of the campaign since 2006, and , had raised more than $59.2 million (equivalent to $ in 2025) for St. Jude&#x27;s.

=== Environmental record ===
On May 9, 2007, Kmart was penalized $102,422 (equivalent to $ in ) for violations of federal hazardous waste, clean water, emergency planning and preparation regulations at 17 distribution centers. Kmart corrected the violations by preparing and implementing spill-prevention control and countermeasure plans, applying for appropriate storm-water permits, complying with hazardous-waste-generator requirements, and submitting reports to state and local emergency-planning and response organizations informing them of the presence of hazardous substances. The Environmental Protection Agency also accused Kmart of not maintaining adequate information and failing to act in accordance with hazardous-waste-storage and disposal requirements. For instance, the EPA reported having discovered improperly labeled oil-storage drums at a location in Falls, Pennsylvania.

Kmart promoted battery recycling. In 1990, Kmart proposed spending about $80 million (equivalent to $ in ) on full-page newspaper advertisements offering to recycle junk batteries for $2 (equivalent to $ in ) each.

===Data breaches===
====October 2014====
In October 2014, Kmart reported that malware was present on some of its in-store payment systems in early September at a number of stores.

====September 2017====
Between September 26 and October 12 of 2017, malware were installed in the computers operated by a service provider that provided service for sears.com and kmart.com ecommerce sites in which the credit card information of 100,000 customers were exposed via a malicious script. The breech was not publicly announced until April 2024.

====June 2018 incident====
In June 2018, Sears Holdings reported that hackers were able to steal credit card numbers at several Kmart stores by accessing the store payment systems by a &quot;viruslike computer code&quot; that was undetectable by then current anti-virus systems.

====June 2021====
An unauthorized party accessed Transformco computer servers between June 3, 2021 and June 15, 2021 that held employee payroll and healthcare information that affected current and past Kmart and other Transformco employees.

=== Animal welfare concerns ===
In 2012, Mercy for Animals, a non-profit organization working against cruelty to farmed animals, conducted an infiltration at Christensen Farms, a pork supplier to Kmart, Walmart and Costco, obtaining hidden-camera footage of pigs confined in small gestation crates and cruelty to piglets. In response to Mercy for Animals&#x27; infiltration, Kmart announced it would begin requiring its pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.

=== Racing sponsorships ===
Kmart was a prominent sponsor in NASCAR and the now-defunct CART series. They were a longtime sponsor of Newman/Haas Racing, owned by actor Paul Newman and former racer Carl Haas. Their CART drivers included Nigel Mansell and the father-son duo of Michael and Mario Andretti. Michael Andretti and Mansell won championships under Kmart sponsorship in 1991 and 1993, respectively. When Michael Andretti moved to Formula One in 1993, Kmart sponsored his McLaren for the season. The store also sponsored the NASCAR-sanctioned Kmart 400 at Michigan and North Carolina Speedway. Lake Speed garnered Kmart&#x27;s first win in NASCAR in 1988 at the Darlington Raceway. Kmart sponsored three-time champion Darrell Waltrip in 1999 and 2000, his last two full-time seasons. Most recently, in NASCAR, the store sponsored Boris Said&#x27;s #60 No Fear Ford Fusion in 2006.

=== Operations in Puerto Rico ===
On November 25, 1959, the S. S. Kresge chain expanded with the opening of its first store in Puerto Rico, a 17,678 square-foot unit at the 65th Infantry shopping center in San Juan, the capital city of the island. More Kresge stores would go on to open on the island in the 1960s, such as the Santa Rosa Plaza store in Bayamón in February 1960, the Norte shopping center store in Santurce in March 1962, the Centro del Sur shopping center store in Ponce in June 1962, and the Reparto Metropolitano shopping center store in Río Piedras in February 1965. In June 1987, Kresge stores in Puerto Rico would begin to cease operations with the closure of the Centro del Sur store that month, and another store also in Ponce.

On October 21, 1964, the Kmart chain also expanded beyond the contiguous United States, opening a 69,000 square-foot unit at the San Patricio Plaza shopping center in Guaynabo. On December 31, 1967, a fire would consume the building where the Kmart was located at the San Patricio Plaza shopping center leaving it completely destroyed. The fire, which caused an estimated loss of $1.5 million, was started in some boxes and sheets of cardboard partitioning walls behind the store outside the building. On January 30, 1969, the destroyed Kmart store, after being re-built, would re-inaugurate at the shopping center.

On May 3, 1979, a new Kmart store would open in the town of Trujillo Alto on the island. The new store, of 84,180 square-feet, was the chain&#x27;s third in Puerto Rico, and increased the total number of Kmart stores to 1,532 located in the United States and Canada.

On May 28, 1983, the Kmart Corporation had completed the acquisition of five lease contracts for stores previously operated by the Barker&#x27;s chain on the Island, and hoped to reopen them by September or October of that year. Kmart had paid approximately $2.1 million to obtain the leases for these stores. The Barker&#x27;s chain had closed 16 stores it had in Puerto Rico earlier that year due to financial problems of its parent company, KDT Industries. KDT had filed for bankruptcy and began auctioning the leases of the Barker&#x27;s stores that had closed. Three new Kmart stores would open in October of that year on the island, two stores in Bayamón at the Plaza Río Hondo shopping mall and the Rexville Plaza shopping center, and one in Arecibo at the Plaza del Atlántico shopping mall. This would increase the number of people Kmart employed on the Island to more than 700 in the 12 stores it now had, which included six Kmart stores and six Kresge stores.

On April 23, 1998, it was reported that the Kmart chain would be investing more than $25 million on the Island before the end of the year to convert eight of its 21 stores at the time into Big Kmart stores and that two new stores would be opening, one in Vega Alta and another in the Plaza Las Américas shopping mall. James Mesenbring, Kmart regional manager for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, said that four new Big Kmart stores would be inaugurated, located at the Montehiedra Town Center, Los Colobos shopping center in Carolina, and the Plaza Guayama shopping mall and in Cayey. These joined the Big Kmart stores that already operated at the San Patricio Plaza and in the Las Catalinas Mall in Caguas. In July of that year, the stores in Vega Baja, Bayamón (Plaza Río Hondo), Caguas (Rafael Cordero Avenue) and Trujillo Alto would also be converted. Meanwhile, in August of that year, they planned to open the Big Kmart in Vega Alta at a cost of $10 million, and in November they would inaugurate the two-level store in Plaza Las Américas, which would be the chain&#x27;s largest store on the Island with 144,000 square-feet of space.

Between 2002 and 2003, three Kmart stores on the island closed due to the bankruptcy, one in Humacao in 2002, one in 2003 at the Juncos Plaza shopping center in Juncos, and another store in Cayey that same year.

In 2011, the Kmart chain opened a new smaller store concept at 8,000 square-feet named “Kmart Express” at the Plaza Carolina shopping mall in Carolina, this was short lived. Through the 2010s and beyond the Kmart chain began to downsize in Puerto Rico with various closures. In 2015, two Kmart stores closed, one at the Señorial Plaza in San Juan, and one in Vega Baja. In December 2018, three Kmart stores announced their closure, the San Patricio Plaza store, the Las Catalinas Mall store, and one in the town of San Germán. In August 2019, five more Kmart stores announced their closure, located in Aguadilla, Trujillo Alto, Cayey, Carolina, and Yauco. In November 2019, another five Kmart stores announced their closure, located in Fajardo, Juana Díaz, Arecibo, Plaza Río Hondo, and Vega Alta. In January 2020 another store located at the Plaza Centro Mall in Caguas announced its closure. In June 2020, two more Kmart stores were announced to be closing, one located at Plaza Guaynabo shopping mall in Guaynabo, and one in Ponce. And in December 2020, two more Kmart stores announced their closure, located in the Rexville Town Center in Bayamón, and the Western Plaza in Mayagüez. On October 15, 2022, after being the only store in the chain left open on the island since 2021, the Plaza las Américas Kmart store announced it was closing permanently, with Kmart entirely ceasing operations in Puerto Rico. Owners of the mall had reportedly been negotiating for Kmart to vacate the building for a new tenant for months, and finally Kmart agreed to move out by that October.

=== Operation in Guam ===
Kmart has its Guam location in Tamuning. The Kmart in Guam gets American customers as well as tourists from Asian countries. the Guam store sold $100,000,000 worth of goods per year, the highest of any existing Kmart at the time, and had the highest customer count of any Kmart store. Because of its distance from competition and a lack of online shopping options in Guam, Lucy Craymer of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the Guam Kmart was in &quot;a retail version of the Galapagos.&quot;

== International ==
=== Australia and New Zealand ===

The first Kmart store in Australia opened in 1969 in Burwood East, Victoria; the site was renovated in 2010 to be a shopping mall known as &quot;Burwood One.&quot;

Kmart Australia was born out of a joint venture between G.J. Coles &amp; Coy Limited (Coles) and the S.S. Kresge Company (Kresge), with Kresge owning 51% of the common stock in the company and the remaining 49% being owned by Coles. The first New Zealand store opened in Henderson, a suburb of Auckland, in 1988. Kresge later exited this partnership in 1994 selling their ownership in the company to Coles Myer, the successor to G. J. Coles &amp; Coy Limited. Since the dissolution of Coles Myer in 2007, the Australian and New Zealand Kmart stores are owned by Wesfarmers.

=== Canada ===
Kmart opened their first store in Canada in Huron Heights, Ontario on March 14, 1963, followed by a second location in Windsor, Ontario on May 9, 1963.

Kmart closed five stores in Greater Montreal in 1983-84. Kresge ceased to exist in Canada in 1994. In December 1997, it was announced that ten of the existing 122 stores were to be closed. However, as a result of Kmart&#x27;s ongoing financial difficulties, the Canadian division comprising 112 stores was sold to competitor Zellers of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in May 1998, after which the stores were either closed or converted to Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company brands, mostly Zellers.

=== Caribbean ===
In the early 2000s, Kmart tried to expand into Caribbean countries where Wal-Mart and Target had no presence, but ultimately none of the proposed stores advanced beyond the construction stage and none opened by the time Kmart filed for bankruptcy in 2002 when it stopped paying its construction contractors.

Kmart started construction of a Super Kmart in 2001 in Trinidad, but halted it in 2002 when the store was 80 percent complete. There were plans for more stores to be built in Trinidad, as well as in Millennium Heights in Barbados, five stores in the Dominican Republic, and a potential foray into Jamaica.

=== Europe ===
In 1992, Kmart purchased several communist-era department stores in Eastern Europe, including 13 in the former Czechoslovakia that were bought from the former Czechoslovak government. Many of these outlets were quite profitable, with the Bratislava location setting a single-store sales record for the company. In March 1996, due to its troubles in the U.S., the Kmart Corporation announced that it had agreed to sell the six Kmart stores in the Czech Republic and the seven in Slovakia to Tesco of Britain for about $117.5 million (equivalent to $ in 2025), to focus on its core operations in North America.

=== Mexico ===
In the 1990s, Kmart opened four stores in Mexico, in partnership with the Mexican retailer Liverpool. All were supercenters located in suburbs of Mexico City. About half of the store area was devoted to groceries, and this part of the stores resembled those in the US with some adjustments to the local market. These plus an unfinished store were sold in 1997 to the Mexican hypermarket chain Mega (part of Comercial Mexicana) and remain open under that name, except the store in Tlalnepantla, which was demolished in 2004 to build a Costco.

=== Singapore ===
Plans to open Kmart stores in Singapore were announced in August 1993. Known as K-Mart Metro, it was a joint venture with Metro (Private) Limited, a subsidiary of Metro Holdings of Singapore.

Its first Kmart outlet in the country, a 9,700-square-metre (104,000 sq ft) store in the Marina Square Shopping Center, opened on May 19, 1994. A second Kmart outlet in Lucky Plaza opened in July 1994. A third and final store was opened in Century Square in October 1995. Kmart had a total of three stores in Singapore when the company announced in June 1996 that they plan to close all three stores.

The joint venture with Singapore was dissolved in 1996. The Marina Square location became MegaMart, then as NTUC FairPrice and Giant.

<text>Astaroth (also Ashtaroth, Astarot and Asteroth), in demonology, is considered to be the Great Duke of Hell. He is described as a male figure, most likely named after the unrelated Near Eastern goddess Astarte.

== Background ==
The name &quot;Astaroth&quot; was ultimately derived from that of 2nd millennium BC Phoenician goddess Astarte, an equivalent of the Babylonian Ishtar, and the earlier Sumerian Inanna. She is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the forms &quot;Ashtoreth&quot; (singular) and &quot;Ashtaroth&quot; (plural, in reference to multiple statues of it). This latter form was directly transliterated in the early Greek and Latin versions of the Bible, where it was less apparent that it had been a plural feminine in Hebrew. Otherwise, the male demon &quot;Astaroth&quot; is entirely unrelated to the benevolent goddess &quot;Ashtoreth&quot;.

==Appearances in literature==
The name &quot;Astaroth&quot; as a male demon is first seen in &quot;The Book of Abramelin&quot;, purportedly written in Hebrew , and recurred in most occult grimoires of the following centuries. Astaroth also features as an archdemon associated with the &quot;qlippoth&quot; (adverse forces) according to later Kabbalistic texts, as he rules over the qlippa of Jupiter, known as Gha&#x27;agsheblah.

Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer also described Astaroth in his &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (1577) thus: &quot;Astaroth is a great and a strong duke, coming forth in the shape of a foul angel, sitting upon an infernal dragon, and carrying on his left hand a viper&quot;, who also claimed to rule 40 legions. Additionally, he had to be approached by the conjurer with a magical ring on account. He is similarly referred to in the 17th-century work &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;. He also makes an appearance in the notorious &quot;Grimorium Verum&quot; (&quot;True Grimoire&quot;), as the infernal principality which rules the Americas.

According to some demonologists of the 16th century, August is the month during which this demon&#x27;s attacks against man are stronger. According to Sebastien Michaelis, he is a demon of the First Hierarchy, who seduces by means of laziness, self-doubt, and rationalized philosophies. His adversary is St. Bartholomew, who can protect against him for he has resisted Astaroth&#x27;s &quot;temptations&quot;. To others, he teaches mathematical sciences and handicrafts, can make men invisible and lead them to hidden treasures, and answers every question formulated to him. He was also said to give to mortal beings the power over serpents.

Was mentioned as a co-signatory of a Diabolical pact with Urban Grandier.

According to Francis Barrett (), Astaroth is the prince of accusers and inquisitors. In art, in the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; (1818), Astaroth is depicted as a nude man with feathered wings, wearing a crown, holding a serpent in one hand, and riding a beast with dragon-like wings and a serpent-like tail.
==Appearances in film==

Ashtaroth is one of three demons summoned by Faustus to attack Benvolio in &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;.

The &quot;Star of Astoroth&quot; features prominently in the 1971 Disney film &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot;, where it takes the form of a magical medallion.

Astaroth is named in the 1976 Hammer horror film &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot;.

In the 1920 silent horror film &quot;The Golem: How He Came into the World&quot;, Rabbi Loew and his assistant summon Astaroth to animate the Golem resulting in deadly and destructive results.

Astaroth also appears in the 2007 television series &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, with his symbol displayed in the first few episodes.

The Solomonic seal of Astaroth makes an appearance in the 2017 film &quot;Pyewacket&quot;.

Astaroth symbolism is also prevalent in the 2018 film &quot;&quot;, and a symbol of Astaroth appears in the movie over 170 times.

Astaroth is the title character in &quot;Astaroth&quot;/&quot;Astaroth Female Demon&quot;, a film by the Brazilian director Larissa Anzoategui. The name of the company that made the film is also &quot;Astaroth Produções&quot;

Astaroth appears as the main antagonist of the 2022 movie &quot;R.I.P.D. 2: Rise of the Damned&quot;.

<text>In software development, a traceability matrix (TM) is a document, usually in the form of a table, used to assist in determining the completeness of a relationship by correlating any two baselined documents using a many-to-many relationship comparison. It is often used with high-level requirements (these often consist of marketing requirements) and detailed requirements of the product to the matching parts of high-level design, detailed design, test plan, and test cases.

A requirements traceability matrix may be used to check if the current project requirements are being met, and to help in the creation of a request for proposal, software requirements specification, various deliverable documents, and project plan tasks.

Common usage is to take the identifier for each of the items of one document and place them in the left column. The identifiers for the other document are placed across the top row. When an item in the left column is related to an item across the top, a mark is placed in the intersecting cell. The number of relationships are added up for each row and each column. This value indicates the mapping of the two items. Zero values indicate that no relationship exists. It must be determined if a relationship must be made. Large values imply that the relationship is too complex and should be simplified.

To ease the creation of traceability matrices, it is advisable to add the relationships to the source documents for both backward and forward traceability. That way, when an item is changed in one baselined document, it is easy to see what needs to be changed in the other.

<text>The Ashuapmushuan River is a river in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of the Canadian provinces of Quebec. It starts at the outlet of Lake Ashuapmushuan, and flows first in a north-easterly direction for about whereafter it continues south-east to Saint-Félicien. There it drains into Lac Saint-Jean of which it is the third largest tributary after the Peribonka and Mistassini Rivers. The river is long but its source is from its mouth.

Typical median summer flow is between , whereas during spring run-off, the median flow is , but the river could swell anywhere from . Lowest flow conditions occur in March with a median flow of and a minimum of to a maximum of .

The Ashuapmushuan River forms the northern boundary of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve for most of its length. As a wild undeveloped river, and accessible from Quebec Route 167 close to Lake Ashuapmushuan, it is a popular destination for canoe camping.

A new aquatic reserve is being considered that would protect of the Ashuapmushuan River, including its floodplain and valley slopes. The reserve prohibits logging, mining, and hydro-electric development, while protecting critical landlocked salmon habitats, biodiversity, and sites of archaeological interest.

==Etymology==
The name Ashuapmushuan, which was not officially adopted until 1982, is an Innu word meaning &quot;place where one lies in wait for moose&quot;.

The river was however first called &quot;Necouba&quot; by Louis Jolliet in 1679. This name was also used by Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin and Guillaume Delisle in 1686 and 1703 respectively. But in 1732 surveyor Normandin considered this an error, who referred to the &quot;Necoubeau&quot; as a tributary to Lake Ashuapmushuan that was called Lake Chomonchouane by Laure on his maps of 1731 and 1732. Therefore, Normandin renamed the river to &quot;Chomontchouane&quot;. In 1917, the &quot;Commission de géographie&quot; officially adopted the modernized spelling of &quot;Chamouchouane&quot;.

==Geography==

The Ashuapmushuan basin is part of the Central Laurentians in the natural region of the Lake Manouane Depression. The river is enclosed in narrow valleys for a large part of its course, with powerful rapids and a dozen waterfalls, of which the most impressive are the Chaudière Falls.

From the mouth of Ashuapmushuan Lake, the course of the Ashuapmushuan river flows over , with a drop of , according to the following segments:

Upper course of the Ashuapmushuan river (segment of ; difference in height of )

* northwards crossing Lake Denaut on (length: ; altitude: ), bending towards the north-east, bypassing an island before passing under the road bridge, to the la Loche river (coming from the north-west);
* north-east to a bend in the river; then east, to the Mazarin River (coming from the north);
* south-east, up to the confluence of the Du Chef River (coming from the north);

Intermediate course of the Ashuapmushuan river (upstream of the Chef river) (segment of ; difference in height of )

* southeasterly, up to a bend in the river, corresponding to the outlet (coming from the north) of Desautels stream;
* southeasterly in a straight line, up to a bend corresponding to the outlet (coming from the south) of several lakes including Lac en Dentelle and Lac Charles-Lacroix ;
* towards the east by forming three large curves towards the north, until the confluence of the rivière aux Brochets (coming from east);
* eastwards, to the confluence of the Kanishushteu River (coming from the west);
* towards the east, then turning towards the south-east in a deep valley, until the confluence of the Chigoubiche River (coming from the west);

Intermediate course of the Ashuapmushuan river (upstream of the Chigoubiche river) (segment of ; drop in height of )

* eastwards, up to a bend corresponding to the outlet of lakes André, Larouaque and Guillemet;
* first towards the south by crossing a series of rapids, then the Chutes de la Chaudière; then turning southeast in a deep valley, to a bend in the river, then east (slightly to the south) almost in a straight line, collecting the outlet (coming from the south) from Lac de la Savane, to the confluence of the Moncou stream (coming from the north);
* crossing the White Spruce Rapids, collecting the Petite rivière aux Saumons (coming from the north-west), collecting the outlet of Lac du Cran, until at the Cran river (coming from the south);
* first towards the east by forming a hook towards the north, in particular by collecting the Rivière à la Loutre (coming from the northwest) and crossing the Rapides Plats; then a large loop to the north where the river bypass the island of the Notary (length: ), to turn southeast, until the confluence of the Pémonca river (coming from South West);

Lower Ashuapmushuan River (segment of ; difference in height of )

* first by forming a loop towards the south-east by crossing two series of rapids going up towards the north; then forming a big M where the current crosses the Little Bear Falls, then the Big Bear Falls, up to a bend in the river;
* south-east, bypassing Adhémar Island, until the confluence of the Salmon river (coming from the west);
* towards the south-east by crossing the Michel waterfall, passing under the railway bridge, crossing two series of rapids, up to the Carbonneau bridge which connects downtown Saint-Félicien at the north shore;
* towards the east by collecting the Petite rivière Eusèbe (coming from the west), by forming a curve towards the south while passing in front of the town of Saint-Félicien (located on the south side) and in front of the Saint-Félicien airfield (located on the north side), bypassing a group of islands including Hudon Island (length: , as well as collecting the rivière à l&#x27;Ours; then forming another curve going north on , where the river bypasses Michelangelo Island (length: ) and Île Sauvage, forming a gulf, gradually widens over , up to reach a width of at the height of Pointe Sainte-Method (located on the north shore), to its mouth.

The river finally flows into Lac Saint-Jean a few kilometers downstream from Saint-Félicien, near Saint-Prime. The river finally flows into Lac Saint-Jean a few kilometers downstream from Saint-Félicien, near Saint-Prime. From the mouth of the Ashuapmushuan river, the current crosses Lac Saint-Jean east on (its full length), follows the course of the Saguenay River via the Petite Décharge on east to Tadoussac where it merges with the Estuary of Saint Lawrence.

Municipal territories crossed by the river

Starting from the upstream (Ashuapmushuan Lake), the course of the Ashuapmushuan river descends, crossing the following municipal territories:

From the confluence of the Du Chef River and the Saint-Félicien limit, the course of the Ashuapmushuan river turns out to be the limit between the Maria-Chapdelaine Regional County Municipality (side north of the river) and Le Domaine-du-Roy Regional County Municipality (south side).

==History==

The Ashuapmushuan River Basin is home to several archaeological sites that show that indigenous people occupied the area for thousands of years. European explorers and missionaries came in the 17th century. For instance, Charles Albanel used the river for his voyage to Hudson Bay in 1672.

In 1685, French fur traders set up a trading post on the eastern shore of Lake Ashuapmushuan that remained almost continuously in operation until the middle of the 19th century. It successively came under control of the Traite de Tadoussac (French period), King&#x27;s Posts (English period), the North West Company (1802), and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (1821). During this period, the river became a major link in the fur trade route from Tadoussac to Hudson Bay since its source is just east of Lake Mistassini on the Rupert River. The vestiges of the post are considered some of the most valuable and best preserved relics from the era.

After the fur trade, the Ashuapmushuan River was used by logging companies to drive logs downstream.

==Fauna==
The Ashuapmushuan River and its tributaries provide spawning grounds and habitats for landlocked salmon (&quot;Salmo salar ouananiche&quot;). Newly hatched salmon remain in the river for 2 to 4 years before migrating to Lake Saint-Jean where it remains for most of its adult life. Then, at age 4 to 8, it will return to the river to spawn. While the Ashuapmushuan River has significantly contributed to salmon production for the lake, the salmon population has seen a sharp decline in the 1990s. Despite conservation measures, its status remains of concern.

<text>Normandin () is a city located on the west side of Lac Saint-Jean in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Normandin is named after the surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin. Its history of European-Canadian settlement began in 1878 when the first pioneers arrived.

<doc id="242097" wikidata="Q1558113" url="?curid=242097" title="Anti-establishment">
<text>An anti-establishment view or belief is one which stands in opposition to the conventional social, political, and economic principles of a society. The term was first used in the modern sense in 1958 by the British magazine &quot;New Statesman&quot; to refer to its political and social agenda. Antiestablishmentarianism (or anti-establishmentarianism) is an expression for such a political philosophy. Anti-establishment positions vary depending on political orientation. For example, during the protests of 1968, anti-establishment positions generally emerged from left-wing, socialist, and anarchist circles. In the 2010s, however, anti-establishment positions generally emerged from right-wing populist circles.

== By country ==
=== Argentina ===
The Libertad Avanza coalition—led by Javier Milei—has an ideology revolving anti-Peronism.

=== Australia ===
Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation Party and the United Australia Party (formerly Palmer United) have both been referred to as anti-establishment parties.

=== Canada ===
The People&#x27;s Party of Canada is seen as anti-establishment political party. Bernier was accused by prominent Conservative politicians such as former prime ministers Stephen Harper and Brian Mulroney of trying to divide the political right. Bernier responded to Power and Politics that he wanted to focus on the disaffected voters stating that &quot;there is 20 per cent of the population who do not even bother to vote that his party will debate discussions that &quot;the leadership and the caucus&quot; did not want to have when he was a party member.

=== Iceland ===
The Pirate Party of Iceland has a movement of anti-establishment.

=== India ===
In India, the 1960s saw emergence of a group of writers who called themselves Hungryalists. They were the first anti-establishment and counter culture writers in Bengal whose dissenting voice drew attention of the government and court cases were filed against them. The main anti-establishment voices in Bengali literature have been Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury, Subimal Basak, Falguny Roy and Tridib Mitra.

However, anti-establishment littlemag movement is still active both in Bangladesh and West Bengal.

=== Italy ===
The Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League are considered anti-establishment parties. The M5S led by Luigi Di Maio won the most votes in the 2018 Italian general election and formed the largest groups in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate. The center-right electoral alliance led by League&#x27;s secretary Matteo Salvini won a pluralities of seats in both houses. The M5S and the League agreed to form a government coalition, which resulted in Giuseppe Conte being appointed Prime Minister and forming the 65th government of the Italian Republic.

Power to the People, a left-wing to far-left electoral alliance comprising several parties, organizations, associations, committees and social centers, is also an anti-establishment movement. In its manifesto, membership to Power to the People is described as &quot;social and political, anti-liberist and anti-capitalist, communist, socialist, environmentalist, feminist, secular, pacifist, libertarian and southernist left-wing&quot;, whose goal as coalition is &quot;to create real democracy, through daily practices, self-governance experiments, socialisation of knowing and popular participation&quot;. In the 2018 general election, they obtained 370,320 votes for the Chamber of Deputies (1.13%) and 319,094 votes for the Senate (1.05%), without electing any representatives.

=== Mexico ===
The election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador as President of Mexico was deemed as anti-establishment by pundits.

=== Paraguay ===
The National Crusade Party, founded and led by former senator Paraguayo Cubas, has anti-establishment elements within the party. In the 2023 general election, Cubas ended in third place in the presidential election—with almost 23% of the vote—while in the parliamentary election, the party became the third political force in both chambers.

=== Pakistan ===
Pakistan has a long history of anti-establishment/anti-military movements but in the recent past Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was considered to be the biggest anti-establishment movement in Pakistan. The movement was a political coalition of the major political parties of Pakistan, including Pakistan Muslim League (N), Pakistan People&#x27;s Party, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) and other 12 smaller or regional parties. Since ouster of former PM Imran Khan April 2022, the whole facade of anti-establishment stands exposed. The same so called anti-establishment/military forces stood behind few generals for shared benefits but a powerful resistance and steadfastness of majority of Pakistani people in Pakistan chose to stand behind Imran Khan, believed in and sided with his narrative. This movement was a surprise to country’s powerful generals who couldn’t work it out and kept making mistakes one after another. Due to which Imran Khan and his humongous backing of nation started to scare generals, PDM and others. It resulted in brutal use of force and crackdowns against Imran Khan and his party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Since April 2022 strong voices have been taken down allegedly by ISI and Pakistan Army for example Arshad Sharif who was a very professional and upright investigative journalist and strong aide of Pakistani military but since ouster of Imran Khan he sides with him and became very critical of powerful generals who, allegedly, hounded him out of the country and eventually got him murdered in Kenya in October 2022. Another example is Imran Riaz Khan who have been a strong critic of Pakistani military establishment has been forcefully disappeared since May 2023 and many other journalist and activists became victim of military fascism including Ayaz Amir, Sami Abraham, Jameel Farooqi, Sabir Shakir etc. 

Even after several crackdowns against the public and majority party of Pakistan, military establishment fails to regain its credibility, respect and trust of common people. These crimes of Pakistani military are not shown by Pakistani media and by some parts of international media. 

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK anti-establishment figures and groups are seen as those who argue or act against the ruling class. Examples of British anti-establishment satire include much of the humour of Peter Cook and Ben Elton; novels such as Rumpole of the Bailey; magazines such as &quot;Private Eye&quot;; and television programmes like &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;, and &quot;The Prisoner&quot; (see also the satire boom of the 1960s). Anti-establishment themes also can be seen in the novels of writers such as Will Self.

However, by operating through the arts and media, the line between politics and culture is blurred, so that pigeonholing figures such as Banksy as either anti-establishment or counter-culture figures can be difficult. The tabloid newspapers such as &quot;The Sun&quot;, are less subtle, and commonly report on the sex-lives of the Royals simply because it sells newspapers, but in the process have been described as having anti-establishment views that have weakened traditional institutions. On the other hand, as time passes, anti-establishment figures sometimes end up becoming part of the Establishment, as Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman, became a Knight in 2003, or when The Who frontman Roger Daltrey was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 in recognition of both his music and his work for charity.

=== United States ===
Individuals who were anti-establishment often spoke of &quot;fighting the man&quot;, not wanting to be &quot;selling out to the Establishment&quot;, and &quot;tearing down the Establishment.&quot; Many well renowned activists and activist groups innovated great changes to society by standing up to &quot;the Establishment&quot;.

&quot;The Establishment&quot; to these, and these anti-establishment activists was not simply the people of the older generation. Dictionary.com defines the establishment as &quot;the existing power structure in society; the dominant groups in society and their customs or institutions; institutional authority&quot;, Merriam-Webster defines the words as &quot;a group of social, economic, and political leaders who form a ruling class&quot; and The Free Dictionary defines it as &quot;A group of people holding most of the power and influence in a government or society.&quot; Social critic and &quot;people&#x27;s&quot; historian Howard Zinn defines the establishment as &quot;Republicans, Democrats, newspapers [and] television&quot; in his book, &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States.&quot; Later Zinn calls out the &quot;huge military establishment&quot; which one could assume is part of his definition of the &quot;Establishment.&quot; In a chapter of the book that expresses Zinn&#x27;s political theory for the future he defines &quot;the Establishment [as] that uneasy club of business executives, generals, and politicos.&quot;

Later in Zinn&#x27;s book is a reprinted quote from Samuel Huntington, who was a Harvard University political science professor and White House political consultant, that describes the establishment and the coalition a president should establish upon being elected:
:&quot;...the President act[s]...with the support and cooperation of key individuals and groups in the executive office, the federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more important businesses, banks, law firms, foundations, and media, which constitute the private sector&#x27;s &quot;Establishment.&quot;...The day after [the President&#x27;s]...election, the size of his majority is almost — if not entirely — irrelevant to his ability to govern the country. What counts then is his ability to mobilize support from the leaders of key institutions in a society and government. ... This coalition must include key people in Congress, the executive branch, and the private-sector &#x27;Establishment&#x27;.&quot;

==== Early usage ====
Anti-establishment in the United States began in the 1940s and continued through the 1950s.

Many World War II veterans, who had seen horrors and inhumanities, began to question every aspect of life, including its meaning. Urged to return to &quot;normal lives&quot; and plagued by post traumatic stress disorder (discussing it was &quot;not manly&quot;), in which many of them went on to found the outlaw motorcycle club Hells Angels. Some veterans, who founded the Beat Movement, were denigrated as &quot;Beatniks&quot; and accused of being &quot;downbeat&quot; on everything. Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote a Beat autobiography that cited his wartime service.

Citizens had also begun to question authority, especially after the Gary Powers U-2 Incident, wherein President Eisenhower repeatedly assured people the United States was not spying on Russia, then was caught in a blatant lie. This general dissatisfaction was popularized by Peggy Lee&#x27;s laconic pop song &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot;, but remained unspoken and unfocused. It was not until the Baby Boomers came along in huge numbers that protest became organized, who were named by the Beats as &quot;little hipsters&quot;.

==== 1960s ====
&quot;Anti-establishment&quot; became a buzzword of the tumultuous 1960s. Young people raised in comparative luxury saw many wrongs perpetuated by society and began to question &quot;the Establishment&quot;. Contentious issues included the ongoing Vietnam War with no clear goal or end point, the constant military build-up and diversion of funds for the Cold War, perpetual widespread poverty being ignored, money-wasting boondoggles like pork barrel projects and the Space Race, festering race issues, a stultifying education system, repressive laws and harsh sentences for casual drug use, and a general malaise among the older generation. On the other side, &quot;Middle America&quot; often regarded questions as accusations, and saw the younger generation as spoiled, drugged-out, sex-crazed, unambitious slackers.

Anti-establishment debates were common because they touched on everyday aspects of life. Even innocent questions could escalate into angry diatribes. For example, &quot;Why do we spend millions on a foreign war and a space program when our schools are falling apart?&quot; would be answered with &quot;We need to keep our military strong and ready to stop the Communists from taking over the world.&quot; As in any debate, there were valid and unsupported arguments on both sides. &quot;Make love not war&quot; invoked &quot;America, love it or leave it.&quot;
As the 1960s simmered, the anti-Establishment adopted conventions in opposition to the Establishment. T-shirts and blue jeans became the uniform of the young because their parents wore collar shirts and slacks. Drug use, with its illegal panache, was favored over the legal consumption of alcohol. Promoting peace and love was the antidote to promulgating hatred and war. Living in genteel poverty was more &quot;honest&quot; than amassing a nest egg and a house in the suburbs. Rock &#x27;n roll was played loudly over easy listening. Dodging the draft was passive resistance to traditional military service. Dancing was free-style, not learned in a ballroom. Over time, anti-establishment messages crept into popular culture: songs, fashion, movies, lifestyle choices, television.

The emphasis on freedom allowed previously hushed conversations about sex, politics, or religion to be openly discussed. A wave of radical liberation movements for minority groups came out of the 1960s, including second-wave feminism; Black Power, Red Power, and the Chicano Movement; and gay liberation. These movements differed from previous efforts to improve minority rights by their opposition to respectability politics and militant tone. Programs were put in place to deal with inequities: Equal Opportunity Employment, the Head Start Program, enforcement of the Civil Rights Act, busing, and others. But the widespread dissemination of new ideas also sparked a backlash and resurgence in conservative religions, new segregated private schools, anti-gay and anti-abortion legislation, and other reversals. Extremists tended to be heard more because they made good copy for newspapers and television. In many ways, the angry debates of the 1960s led to modern right-wing talk radio and coalitions for &quot;traditional family values&quot;.

As the 1960s passed, society had changed to the point that the definition of the Establishment had blurred, and the term &quot;anti-establishment&quot; seemed to fall out of use.

==== 1960s to present: the use of anti-establishment rhetoric in American politics ====

Howard Zinn, in his bestseller titled &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot; mentions the concept of &quot;establishment&quot; several times in the book. In reference to the 1896 election and McKinley&#x27;s victory, when talking about socialism in the early 20th century, a major WWI general strike in 1919, when writing about the aftermath of WWII, in the talk about the repression of a communist party organizer, in discussion of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others, when writing about how even when black leaders were elected, they could not overcome the establishment and in reference to opposition in the Vietnam War, the establishment before and after the Watergate Scandal, the establishment from Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Administration to George H.W.&#x27;s administration, the Iran-Contra Affair and the establishment, the maintaining of the military establishment even after the Cold War ended, the Vietnam Syndrome that leads to anti-establishment thought, and in a discussion of the 2000 election.

==== 1999 WTO protests, Occupy protests and anti-establishment thought ====
In 2011, with the rise of anti-austerity protests, online activism like Anonymous and the advent of the Occupy protests targeting the power of high finance and fighting for &quot;the 99%,&quot; anti-establishment thought has reappeared. BBC News commented in one article that &quot;The sinister Guy Fawkes mask made famous by the film &quot;V for Vendetta&quot; has become an emblem for anti-establishment protest groups.&quot; During the 1999 Seattle WTO protests the Earth Rainbow Network had (and still has) a page titled &quot;The Anti-Establishment Files: Info and background material on the coming World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle.&quot;

==== Shift in usage ====

In recent years, with the rise of the populist right, the term anti-establishment has tended to refer to both left-wing and right-wing movements expressing dissatisfaction with mainstream institutions. For those on the right, this can be fueled by feelings of alienation from major institutions such as the government, corporations, media, and education system, which are perceived as holding progressive social norms, an inversion of the meaning formerly associated with the term. This can be accounted for by a perceived cultural and institutional shift to the left by many on the right. According to Pew Research, Western European populist parties from both sides of the ideological spectrum tapped into anti-establishment sentiment in 2017, &quot;from the Brexit referendum to national elections in Italy&quot;. Sarah Kendzior of QZ argued that the term &quot;anti-establishment&quot; &quot;has lost all meaning&quot;, citing a campaign video from then candidate Donald Trump titled &quot;Fighting the Establishment&quot;. The term anti-establishment has tended to refer to right-wing populist movements, including nationalist movements and anti-lockdown protests, since Trump and the global populist wave, starting as far back as 2015 and as recently as 2021. However, the notion of right-wing movements being seen as anti-establishment has drawn criticism from leftists and liberals, who claim that what Trump and the right advocate is a maintaining of the establishment rather than contesting it, as progressive views espoused by corporations and government officials are often seen more as pandering rather than genuine support for true systemic change.

<text>The Sierra Club is an American environmental organization with chapters in all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico. The club was founded in 1892, in San Francisco, by preservationist John Muir. A product of the progressive movement, it was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world. It has lobbied for policies to promote sustainable energy and mitigating global warming, as well as opposing the use of coal, hydropower, and nuclear power. Its political endorsements generally favor liberal and progressive candidates in elections.

In addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for mountaineering and rock climbing in the United States. Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the Yosemite Decimal System of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group&#x27;s namesake, the Sierra Nevada. The Sierra Club operates only in the United States and holds the legal status of 501(c)(4) nonprofit social welfare organization. Sierra Club Canada is a separate entity.

==Overview==
The Sierra Club&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth&#x27;s ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.&quot;

The Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member board of directors. Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The executive director runs the day-to-day operations of the group. Michael Brune, formerly of Rainforest Action Network, served as the organization&#x27;s executive director from 2010. Brune succeeded Carl Pope. Pope stepped down amid discontent that the group had strayed from its core principles.

In January 2023, former NAACP president Ben Jealous became the organization&#x27;s new executive director, making him the first African American to fulfill the role. 

The Sierra Club is organized on both a national and state level with chapters named for the 50 states and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and Washington D.C.) California is the lone state to have numerous chapters named for California counties. The club chapters allow for regional groups and committees, some of which have many thousands of members. These chapters further allow for special interest sections (e.g. camera, outings), committees (conservation and political), and task forces on a single issue with some kind of geography involved. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence, including the removal and creation of chapters, as well as recruiting and removing members.

The club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Described as one of the United States&#x27; &quot;leading environmental organizations&quot;, the Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Journalist Robert Underwood Johnson had worked with John Muir on the successful campaign to create a large Yosemite National Park surrounding the much smaller state park which had been created in 1864. This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an &quot;association&quot; to help protect the Sierra Nevada, and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist William Keith, Willis Linn Jepson, Warren Olney, Willard Drake Johnson, Joseph LeConte and David Starr Jordan.

In May 1892, the young botany professor, Willis Linn Jepson from the University of California, Berkeley helped Muir and attorney Warren Olney launched the new organization modeled after the eastern Appalachian Mountain Club. The charter members of the Sierra Club elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.

The first goals of the club included establishing Glacier and Mount Rainier national parks, convincing the California legislature to give Yosemite Valley to the U.S. federal government, and preserving coastal redwood forests of California.

Muir escorted President Theodore Roosevelt through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country&#x27;s second national park, after Yellowstone in 1872.

=== Environmental action over the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir ===

In the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir battle that divided preservationists from &quot;resource management&quot; conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city&#x27;s water supply.

Gifford Pinchot, a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the US Forest Service, which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a referendum in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney William Edward Colby began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.

The bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the club supported creation of the National Park Service in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. Stephen Mather, a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.

=== 1920s–1940s ===

During the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierra. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge Sequoia National Park (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve Kings Canyon National Park (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, &quot;In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.&quot;

The New Deal brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of Young Turks who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys Richard Leonard and Bestor Robinson, nature photographer Ansel Adams, and David Brower.

Adams sponsored Brower for membership in the club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the &quot;Sierra Club Bulletin.&quot; After World War II Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the &quot;Sierra Club Bulletin&quot; in 1946.

===National reach===

In 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, The Wilderness Society, and Izaak Walton League, which had long had professional staff.

The Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the Echo Park Dam in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, which had been announced by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower&#x27;s background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, &quot;This Is Dinosaur&quot; was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the Colorado River project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club&#x27;s role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.

The Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The club&#x27;s Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964, marking the first time that public lands (9.1 million acres) were permanently protected from development. Grand Teton National Park and Olympic National Park were also enlarged at the Sierra Club&#x27;s urging.

=== Book series ===
In 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with &quot;This Is the American Earth&quot;, and in 1962, &quot;In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World&quot;, with color photographs by Eliot Porter. These coffee-table books, published by their Sierra Club Books division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as &quot;In Wildness.&quot; Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.

=== Grand Canyon campaign ===
The Sierra Club&#x27;s most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the Grand Canyon. The book &quot;Time and the River Flowing: Grand Canyon&quot; authored by Francois Leydet was published in the Exhibit Format book series. Opposing the Bridge Canyon and Marble Canyon dam projects, full-page ads the club placed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1966 exclaimed, &quot;This time it&#x27;s the Grand Canyon they want to flood,&quot; and asked, &quot;Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?&quot; The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the Internal Revenue Service to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club&#x27;s 501(c)(3) status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the Sierra Club Foundation as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities. Even so, contributions to the club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society&#x27;s tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.

The victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that &quot;the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,&quot; while &quot;the Navajo Reservation&quot;—which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack—&quot;became increasingly industrial.&quot;

=== End of the Brower era ===
Despite the club&#x27;s success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to 501(c)(4) status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The club&#x27;s annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the club&#x27;s policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo, California. Although the club had played the leading role blocking PG&amp;E&#x27;s nuclear power plant proposed for Bodega Bay, California, in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby San Andreas Fault, not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&amp;E&#x27;s plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board&#x27;s decision.

But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the club&#x27;s official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower&#x27;s supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower&#x27;s resignation. Eventually reconciled with the club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000. Brower resigned from the board in 2000.

=== McCloskey years ===

Michael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the club&#x27;s first northwest field representative, became the club&#x27;s second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the club&#x27;s conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish Redwoods National Park and North Cascades National Park. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the club&#x27;s legislative activity—preserving Alaskan lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act amendments, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, passed during the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Efforts of the Sierra Club and others—including Black community organizers who fought against destructive &quot;urban renewal&quot; projects—led to passage of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Water Pollution Control Act.

The Sierra Club formed a political committee and made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of Walter Mondale&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign to unseat Ronald Reagan. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the club&#x27;s senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration. After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the California Coastal Commission, who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. Carl Pope, formerly the club&#x27;s legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.

=== Lobbying within the club ===
In the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.

=== 21st century ===
In 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by Clorox, which had been named one of a &quot;dangerous dozen&quot; chemical companies by the Public Interest Research Group in 2004. According to Carl Pope, the Sierra Club chairman, the deal brought the club $1.3 million over the four-year term of the contract. In November 2011, Pope stepped down amid discontent about the deal and other issues. Between 2007 and 2010, the Sierra Club accepted over $25 million in donations from the gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a large gas drilling company involved in fracking.

In January 2013, executive director Michael Brune announced that the Sierra Club would officially participate in the first civil disobedience action in its 120-year history as part of the ongoing protest calling on the Obama administration to reject the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, stating, &quot;We are watching a global crisis unfold before our eyes, and to stand aside and let it happen—even though we know how to stop it—would be unconscionable.&quot; On February 13, 2013, Brune was arrested along with 48 people, including civil rights leader Julian Bond and NASA climate scientist James Hansen. In May 2015, the Sierra Club appointed its first Black president of the board of directors, Aaron Mair. The Sierra Club endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, citing its opposition to Donald Trump&#x27;s environmental deregulation.

In 2020, in wake of the George Floyd protests and subsequent public reconciliation of systematic racism in public history, the Sierra Club described their own early history intermingled with racism. In particular, the early Sierra Club favored the needs of white members to the exclusion of people of color, and Muir and some of his associates, such as Joseph LeConte, David Starr Jordan, and Henry Fairfield Osborn were closely related to the early eugenics movement in the United States. Michael Brune, writing as the executive director of the Sierra Club, disavowed founder John Muir in the summer of 2020, but some board members said Brune&#x27;s characterization of Muir was not representative of the organization.

In January 2023, former NAACP president Ben Jealous became the organization&#x27;s new executive director, making him the first African American to fill the role. In 2024, Sierra Club listed nuclear power as one of the sources included in Clean Energy Standard (CES).

==Outdoor programs==
===Mountaineering===
In 1901, William Colby organized the first Sierra Club excursion to Yosemite Valley. The annual High Trips were led by mountaineers such as Francis P. Farquhar, Joseph Nisbet LeConte, Norman Clyde, Walter A. Starr, Jr., Jules Eichorn, Glen Dawson, Ansel Adams, and David R. Brower. A number of first ascents in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding Los Angeles and throughout the West. Steve Roper&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Classic Climbs of North America&quot;, sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States. The Wilderness Travel Course is a basic mountaineering class that is administered by the Sierra Club.

===Hiking and outings===
In World War II, a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the 10th Mountain Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://sierraclub.org/outings&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among them was David R. Brower, who managed the High Trip program from 1947 to 1954, while serving as a major in the Army Reserve.

In many areas of the country, Sierra Club also organizes hiking tours. Sierra Club&#x27;s website has a &quot;hiking near me&quot; function. Section &quot;Sierra Club Near You&quot; shows all the upcoming trips in nearby area.

The historic High Trips, sometimes large expeditions with more than a hundred participants and crew, have given way to smaller and more numerous excursions held across the United States and abroad. These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity. Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy. Generally, chapters in California are much more active with regard to outdoor activities.

=== Sierra Club awards ===
The Sierra Club presents a number of annual awards, such as the Sierra Club John Muir Award, the Ansel Adams Award for Conservation Photography, the Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award, the Edgar Wayburn Award for public officials, the Rachel Carson Award for journalists and writers, the William O. Douglas Award for legal work, and the EarthCare Award for international environmental protection and conservation.

==Policy positions==
===Land management===
Land management, access, and conservation are traditionally considered the core advocacy areas of the Sierra Club. Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands. This is particularly accentuated by the fact that the club attracts many people who primarily join the club for recreation and use of public land for hiking.

In 2023, the Sierra Club sued the Puerto Rican government for 18 renewable energy projects on more than 2,000 hectares of land. The Sierra Club argued that the land was ecologically sensitive and of high agricultural value. The Sierra Club said that building renewable energy projects on agricultural land was a &quot;serious attack on the food security of Puerto Rico.&quot;

===Opposition to coal===

A goal of the Sierra Club is to replace coal with other energy sources. Through its &quot;Beyond Coal&quot; campaign, the Sierra Club set a goal to close half of all coal plants in the U.S. by 2017. American business magnate and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg donated $50 million to the Sierra Club&#x27;s anti-coal work in 2011, and announced another $30 million gift to Sierra&#x27;s Beyond Coal campaign in 2015. The Beyond Coal campaign says 187 coal plants have been closed since 2010. Other funders of the Sierra Club&#x27;s anti-coal campaign include the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The CEO of Chesapeake Energy, a natural gas company, donated $26 million to the Beyond Coal campaign between 2007 and 2010.

=== Lawsuits against renewable energy projects ===
The Sierra Club sued the Puerto Rico government in 2023 for its plans to build dozens of renewable energy projects. The organization said the projects were planned to be built on lands that were ecologically sensitive and of high agricultural value. At the time, Puerto Rico was overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels for its energy use, while only 2% of its energy came from renewable sources.

=== Opposition to nuclear power ===
The Sierra Club is &quot;unequivocally opposed&quot; to nuclear power.

===Opposition to hydropower and dams===
The Sierra Club has lobbied against hydropower projects and large-scale dams. In lobbying against hydropower projects, the Sierra Club has expressed opposition to power lines and said that hydropower projects disrupt animal habitats.

The Sierra Club opposes dams it considers inappropriate, including some government-built dams in national parks. In the early 20th century, the organization fought against the damming and flooding of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park. Despite this lobbying, Congress authorized the construction of O&#x27;Shaughnessy Dam on the Tuolumne River. The Sierra Club continues to support removal of the dam.

The Sierra Club advocates the decommissioning of Glen Canyon Dam and the draining of Lake Powell. The club also supports removal, breaching or decommissioning of many other dams, including four dams on the lower Snake River in eastern Washington. The Sierra Club opposes the importation of energy from Quebec&#x27;s hydropower plants to New York, arguing that importing excess energy by the Quebec plants will cause environmental damage and lead to fewer in-state New York renewable energy projects.

===Mixed views on solar projects===
Some chapters of the Sierra Club have lobbied against solar power projects, whereas others have defended solar power projects. The Sierra Club opposed the Battle Born Solar Project, the largest solar project in the U.S., citing its potential impact on desert tortoise habitats. The Sierra Club sued the federal government to stop the 663.5-megawatt Calico solar station in the Mojave Desert in California, saying it would imperil protected wildlife.

===Opposition to streamlined permitting===
In response to proposed reforms to streamline the permitting process for environmental projects amid concerns that environmental permitting reviews were delaying and blocking projects with a beneficial environmental impact, the Sierra Club expressed opposition to such reforms, arguing &quot;Whatever the proposed project is — whether it&#x27;s a pipeline or a highway or a solar farm — it should be subject to the same commonsense review process. If we want these projects to move forward faster, we shouldn&#x27;t be weakening environmental laws, but investing more resources into the agencies and staff.&quot;

===Lawsuits against housing===
The Sierra Club has a history of filing lawsuits against new housing developments and trying to block legislative proposals to ease housing construction. Critics have characterized the Sierra Club&#x27;s actions on housing as NIMBYism.

In 2012, the Sierra Club sued to block the construction of a mixed-use development composed of 16,655 housing units (for an estimated 37,000 residents) and commercial space in Riverside, California.

In 2018, the Sierra Club opposed SB 827, which would have permitted dense housing near major public transit stations in California. Most other environmental groups supported the legislation, as dense housing construction near public transit was estimated to substantially reduce car pollution and help California reach its emissions target. Ethan Elkind, director of the Climate Change and Business Program at UC-Berkeley and UCLA Schools of Law, called it “one of the most important climate bills in California.” The Sierra Club argued the bill sought to take away the sacrosanct right of localities &quot;to make smart local decisions about development.&quot; In 2023, the Sierra Club lobbied against AB 1633, which prevents NIMBY abuse of the California Environmental Quality Act to block new housing developments that already comply with local and state land use and environmental regulations.

In 2023, the Sierra Club sued the state of Hawaii after Hawaii Governor Josh Green issued an emergency declaration to streamline housing construction in order to alleviate the Hawaii housing shortage. The Executive Director of the Sierra Club of Hawaii said that lack of housing supply was not the cause of the housing shortage in Hawaii, but rather the &quot;decades of profiteering off of our lands and waters&quot; by developers.

===Alliance with organized labor===

The Sierra Club is a member of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups and labor unions. The BlueGreen Alliance was formed in 2006 and grew out of a less-formal collaboration between the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers. In 2012, the Laborers&#x27; International Union of North America left the coalition due to the Sierra Club and other environmental groups&#x27; opposition to the Keystone Pipeline.

===Population and immigration===
Immigration was historically among the most divisive issues within the club. In 1996, after years of debate, the Sierra Club adopted a neutral position on immigration levels. As the club has shifted to the left over the years, this position was amended in 2013 to support &quot;an equitable path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants&quot;.

Although the position of the Sierra Club has generally been favorable towards immigration, some critics of the Sierra Club have charged that the efforts of some club members to restrain immigration, are a continuation of aspects of human population control and the eugenics movement. In 1969, the Sierra Club published Paul R. Ehrlich&#x27;s book, &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;, in which he said that population growth was responsible for environmental decline and advocated coercive measures to reduce it. Some observers have argued that the book had a &quot;racial dimension&quot; in the tradition of the Eugenics movement, and that it &quot;reiterated many of Osborn&#x27;s jeremiads.&quot;

During the 1980s, some Sierra Club members, including Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s wife Anne, wanted to take the club into the contentious field of immigration to the United States. The club&#x27;s position was that overpopulation was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the club to support immigration reduction. The club had previously addressed the issue of &quot;mass immigration&quot;, and in 1988, the organization&#x27;s Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.

Other Sierra Club members thought that the immigration issue was too far from the club&#x27;s core environmentalist mission, and were also concerned that involvement would impair the organization&#x27;s political ability to pursue its other objectives. In the mid 1990s, the club began gradually stepping away from the immigration restrictionist position, culminating with the board adopting a neutral position on immigration policy in 1996. In 1998, 60.1% of Sierra Club voting members voted that the organization should remain neutral on America&#x27;s immigration policies, while 39.2% supported a measure calling for stricter curbs on immigration to the United States.

After the 1996 board policy adoption, some members who were advocates of immigration reduction organized themselves as &quot;SUSPS&quot;, a name originally derived from &quot;Sierrans for U.S. Population Stabilization&quot;, which now stands for &quot;Support U.S. Population Stabilization&quot;. SUSPS advocates a return to the Sierra Club&#x27;s &quot;traditional&quot; (1970–1996) immigration policy stance. SUSPS has called for fully closing the borders of the United States, and for returning to immigration levels established by the Immigration Act of 1924, which includes strict ethnic quotas. David Brower also cited the club&#x27;s position shift on immigration as one of the reasons for his resignation from the board in 2000. Supporters of immigration reduction within the club also charged that the board had abandoned the restrictionist position on immigration due to donations from investor David Gelbaum, who reportedly gave $200 million to the club between the mid 1990s and early 2000s and threatened Carl Pope in the mid 1990s to cease donations if they did not change their position on immigration adopted in 1988.

The controversy resurfaced when a group of three immigration reduction proponents ran in the 2004 Sierra Club Board of Directors election, hoping to move the club&#x27;s position away from a neutral stance on immigration, and to restore the stance previously held. Groups outside of the club became involved, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and MoveOn. Of the three candidates, two (Frank Morris and David Pimentel), were on the board of the anti-immigration group Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America and two (Richard Lamm and Frank Morris) were on the board of directors or the board of advisors of the Federation for American Immigration Reform; both had also held leadership positions within the NAACP. Their candidacies were denounced by a fourth candidate, Morris Dees of the SPLC, as a &quot;hostile takeover&quot; attempt by &quot;radical anti-immigrant activists&quot;. The immigration reduction proponents won 7% of all votes cast in the election. In 2005, members voted 102,455 to 19,898 against a proposed change to &quot;recognize the need to adopt lower limits on migration to the United States.&quot;

With the increased number of progressive activists joining the club in recent years, the Sierra Club has dramatically shifted its stance on immigration further towards the affirmative. Today, the Sierra Club supports a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, opposes a border wall and works with immigrant groups to promote environmental justice.

The Sierra Club has been criticized by anti-immigration groups such as the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform for opposing Trump&#x27;s plan of creating a wall on the United States&#x27; southern border. These groups claim that the Sierra Club has criticized the plan for purely partisan reasons and not actually due to any environmental concerns.

==Affiliates and subsidiaries==
The Sierra Club Foundation was founded in 1960 by David R. Brower. A 501(c)(3) organization, it was founded after the Internal Revenue Service revoked the Sierra Club&#x27;s tax-exempt status due to the group&#x27;s political activities. The Sierra Club added its first Canadian chapter in 1963 and in 1989 opened a national office in Ottawa. Canadian affiliates of the Sierra Club operate under the Sierra Club Canada.

In 1971, volunteer lawyers who had worked with the Sierra Club established the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. This was a separate organization that used the &quot;Sierra Club&quot; name under license from the club; it changed its name to Earthjustice in 1997. The Sierra Student Coalition (SSC) is the student-run arm of the Sierra Club. Founded by Adam Werbach in 1991, it has 30,000 members. The Summer Program (SPROG) is a one-week leadership training program that teaches tools for environmental and social justice activism to young people across the country.
 The organization maintains a publishing imprint, Sierra Club Books. They also publish the John Muir library, which includes many of their founder&#x27;s titles.

The Sierra Club Voter Education Fund is a 527 group that became active in the 2004 Presidential election by airing television advertisements about the major party candidates&#x27; positions on environmental issues. Through the Environmental Voter Education Campaign (EVEC), the club sought to mobilize volunteers for phone banking, door-to-door canvassing and postcard writing to emphasize these issues in the campaign.

== Budget and funding ==
The Sierra Club&#x27;s annual budget was $88 million in 2011 and $100 million in 2012. In 2013, the group&#x27;s budget was $97.8 million.

In 2008, Clorox donated $1.3 million to the Sierra Club in exchange for the right to display the Sierra Club&#x27;s logo on a line of cleaning products.

In February 2012, it was reported that the Sierra Club had secretly accepted over $26 million in gifts from the natural gas industry, mostly from Aubrey McClendon, CEO of Chesapeake Energy. The Sierra Club used the Chesapeake Energy money for its Beyond Coal campaign to block new coal-fired power plants and close old ones. Michael Brune reported that he learned of the gifts after he succeeded Carl Pope as executive director of the Sierra Club in 2010. Brune reported that he ended the financial agreement with natural gas industry interests.

In 2013 Naomi Klein wrote on the club taking large, multi-million dollar funding from fossil fuel interests, had begun to spark &quot;major controversy&quot; within it and other &quot;environmental&quot; groups that were in similar receipt of fossil funding.

In 2014, the Energy and Environment Legal Institute filed a referral with the Internal Revenue Service pointing out that Sierra Club and Sierra Club Foundation were not paying income taxes from sales of solar panels for their partners across the US.

The Sierra Club has an affiliated super PAC. It spent $1,000,575 on the 2014 elections, all of it opposing Republican candidates for office. The Sierra Club is a partner of America Votes, an organization that coordinates and promotes progressive issues.

Donors to the Sierra Club have included David Gelbaum, Michael Bloomberg, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The Sierra Club has also received funding from the Democracy Alliance and the Tides Foundation Advocacy Fund.

In 2015, a PR group, known as the Environmental Policy Alliance, claimed that the Sierra Club and other U.S. environmental groups received funding from groups with ties to Russia&#x27;s state-owned oil company.

In April 2023, the Sierra Club announced a restructuring plan in response to a $40 million budget deficit. The following month, the union representing about 400 employees said that dozens of layoffs had occurred, and it filed two complaints with the National Labor Relations Board.

== Criticisms ==
=== Stance on housing ===
The Sierra Club has come under criticism for opposing high-density housing development projects in California, which are intended to reduce the state&#x27;s housing shortage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment (CLEE) at UC Berkeley Law, said that the Sierra Club&#x27;s opposition to California Senate Bill 827—which would require cities to allow denser and taller housing near public transport centers and ease the parking requirements that cities can impose on housing developments—was &quot;surprising&quot;. He wrote, &quot;is Sierra Club an organization of wealthy homeowners who want to keep newcomers out of their upscale, transit-rich areas? Or are they actually committed to fighting climate change by providing enough housing for Californians in low-carbon, infill areas? Because their opposition to SB 827 unfortunately indicates more of the former than the latter.&quot;

In 2023, the Sierra Club of Hawaii criticized Governor Josh Green for issuing an emergency declaration on Hawaii&#x27;s housing shortage and issuing an executive order that streamlined housing construction in Hawaii and suspended various stringent land use regulations.

=== Potential foreign influence ===
In late 2020, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming asked the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, saying that &quot;robust political and judicial activism—combined with the fact that these groups often espouse views that align with those of our adversaries—makes it all the more critical that the Department is aware of any potential foreign influence within or targeting these groups.&quot;

=== Trips to Israel ===
In early 2021, as reported by MondoWeiss, a range of pro-Palestinian organizations demanded that the Sierra Club cancel &quot;greenwashing&quot; trips to &quot;apartheid&quot; Israel. As a result, the Sierra Club announced cancellation of two forthcoming trips, but quickly reversed its decision, saying it was &quot;hastily&quot; made &quot;without consulting a robust set of stakeholders&quot;. MondoWeiss said it subsequently announced a rescheduled trip, which included visits to the Golan Heights and Palestinian territories, but did not cancel the trip.

=== Ramona Strategies Report ===
In June 2021, an executive summary of a report by D.C. consulting firm Ramona Strategies described widespread problems involving harassment, workplace discrimination, and organization protection of abusive senior leadership. The report was commissioned in 2020 after a rape accusation made against a volunteer leader became public and published in August 2021 by &quot;The Intercept&quot;. It acknowledged the Sierra Club&#x27;s reliance on volunteer leadership presented unique challenges and advised reforming its structure as part of a &quot;restorative accountability process&quot;. On August 13, 2021, Michael Brune announced that he would be stepping down as executive director after eleven years, and apologized for any time that volunteers and staff did not &quot;feel safe, supported, and valued&quot;. Politico called the resignation, &quot;a major blow to the U.S. environmental movement and the Democratic party&#x27;s green base&quot;.
