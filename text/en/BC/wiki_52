<text>The United States of America was an American experimental rock band founded in Los Angeles in 1967 by composer Joseph Byrd and vocalist Dorothy Moskowitz, with electric violinist Gordon Marron, bassist Rand Forbes and drummer Craig Woodson. Their 1968 self-titled album, often cited as an early showcase for the use of electronic devices in rock music, was met with critical acclaim and minor chart success. They disbanded shortly after its release.

The group’s sound was grounded in both psychedelia and the avant-garde. Unusually, the band had no guitar player; instead, they used strings, keyboards and electronics, including primitive synthesizers, and various audio processors, including the ring modulator. Many of the songs&#x27; lyrics reflected Byrd&#x27;s leftist political views. AllMusic described them as &quot;among the most revolutionary bands of the late &#x27;60s.&quot;

==History==
===Background and formation===
Composer Joseph Byrd and lyricist and singer Dorothy Moskowitz first met in New York City in early 1963 when Byrd was working on a recording of Civil War period music for Time-Life. A devotee of composer Charles Ives, Byrd had already become a respected and innovative composer, involved in experimental music as part of the Fluxus movement with John Cage, Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, David Tudor, Yoko Ono and others. Moskowitz was studying music at Barnard College, where she was taught by Otto Luening; she also sang in a vocal group with Art Garfunkel, and worked with David Rubinson on a musical theatre production, as well as on the Time-Life project. Byrd and Moskowitz began a relationshiphe has referred to their &quot;profound musical and personal relationship&quot;, and she has described him as being her &quot;aesthetic guru&quot; and he helped her obtain a post with Capitol Records; when she left, she was replaced in turn by Rubinson.

Later in 1963, Byrd and Moskowitz moved together to Los Angeles, where Byrd started a doctorate in ethnomusicology at UCLA. According to Moskowitz: &quot;Joe brought with him a New York avant-garde cachet... a background in electronic music... and composing skills... He attracted immediate attention. Exciting musicians, dancers and visual artists sought collaboration with him. The talent pool for what eventually became the USA was sourced from this group.&quot; Byrd co-founded the New Music Workshop in Los Angeles with jazz trumpeter Don Ellis, and, after Ellis left, began to incorporate elements of performance art into his events. Moskowitz helped stage Byrd&#x27;s performances, and performed in some of them. Both Byrd and Moskowitz also contributed to an album of Indian raga music by Gayathri Rajapur and Harihar Rao, recorded in 1965 and released by Folkways Records in 1968. On one occasion in 1965, as the concluding part of a series of concerts and events called &quot;Steamed Spring Vegetable Pie&quot; (a title taken at random from &quot;The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook&quot;), Byrd organized a blues band fronted by his friend Linda Ronstadt, to play during a &quot;happening&quot;. Byrd said that &quot;the realization that rock was an access to a larger public came out of that concert, and the idea of forming a band began taking shape.&quot;

Byrd became increasingly attracted to radical politics, and became a member of the Communist Party, explaining that it was &quot;the one group that had discipline, an agenda, and was willing to work within the existing institutions to educate and radicalize American society.&quot; He left UCLA, but continued to stage performance art events, albeit on a reduced budget. After their personal relationship broke down in 1966, Moskowitz returned to New York, but she and Byrd stayed in contact. In early 1967 Byrd started to form a rock band with another politically radical composer, Michael Agnello, together with Moskowitz, bassist Stuart Brotman (previously of Canned Heat and later of Kaleidoscope), and African drumming expert Craig Woodson who had also been involved in the New Music Workshop. Audition recordings by this version of the band, from September 1967, are included on some later CD reissues. However, Agnello left the project on a point of principle when a commercial recording contract with Columbia Records was being considered, and Brotman also left.

The first public line-up of the band included Byrd, Moskowitz, Woodson, and two contemporary classical musicians with whom Byrd had worked on earlier experimental projects in the New Music Workshop: Gordon Marron (violin) and Rand Forbes (bass). Later, for some of their recordings and performances, they added Marron&#x27;s friend and writing partner Ed Bogas (keyboards). Byrd initially commissioned electrical engineer Tom Oberheim to build him a ring modulator, later replaced by electronic oscillators in a monophonic synthesizer built by aerospace engineer Richard Durrett. Among other effects, Marron used an octave divider on his electric violin, and Woodson attached contact microphones to his drum set and hung slinkies from his cymbals for a &quot;musique concrète&quot; effect.

As the group&#x27;s founder and leader, Byrd stated that his aesthetic aims for the band and album were to form &quot;an avant-garde political/musical rock group with the idea of combining electronic sound (not electronic music)... musical/political radicalism... [and] performance art.&quot; According to Moskowitz, the choice of the band name &quot;The United States of America&quot; was intentionally provocative: &quot;Using the full name of the country for something so common as a rock group was a way of expressing disdain for governmental policy. It was like hanging the flag upside down.&quot; As well as crediting the influence of Dada-inspired band The Red Crayola, Byrd said:
The demo recorded by the band secured the interest of Clive Davis at Columbia. Through their friend David Rubinson—who had started working for Columbia as a record producer, for bands and musicians including Moby Grape and Taj Mahal—they gained a recording contract.

===Performances and recording===
The band undertook their first live performances in late 1967, at the Ash Grove in Los Angeles, when Agnello was still performing with the band. Byrd explained:
Electronic devices were used live as well as on the album, to process other instruments and Moskowitz&#x27;s voice as well as providing their own musical textures. The band&#x27;s performances got mixed receptions. They undertook a short tour of the East Coast, with Richie Havens and The Troggs, with their performances in Boston and Greenwich Village being especially well received. Byrd later said of their shows: &quot;Audiences generally were positive, sort of... it was a new kind of experience, and it wasn&#x27;t just the music, it was performance art.&quot;

They recorded their first and only album in December 1967, produced by Rubinson, with Byrd credited as providing electronic music, electric harpsichord, organ, calliope, piano, and Durrett Electronic Music Synthesizer. Besides Byrd, Moskowitz (lead vocals), Marron (electric violin, ring modulator), Forbes (fretless electric bass), and Woodson (drums and percussion), several of the tracks also credited Bogas. Moskowitz and Byrd collaborated in writing most of the songs, with Byrd responsible for both words and music on three tracks, &quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&quot;, &quot;Love Song for the Dead Ché&quot;, and &quot;The American Way of Love&quot;. Byrd described &quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&quot; and &quot;The American Way of Love&quot; as &quot;comments on the media as a means of thought-control, and the bourgeois sentimentality of the hippies&#x27; &quot;Summer of Love&quot; compared with the realities of love under capitalism.&quot;

In &quot;Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, Byrd wrote the lyrics for the first verse and chorus; Moskowitz came with the track&#x27;s title and some of the melody and lyrics. On &quot;Coming Down&quot;, Moskowitz contributed to the melody line as well as writing the second and third verses. On &quot;Hard Coming Love&quot;, Byrd wrote the title and first verse, and Moskowitz contributed what she referred to as the &quot;lame doggerel that follows&quot;. Byrd&#x27;s song &quot;Love Song for the Dead Ché&quot; reflects his leftist views; Columbia Records originally wanted the title changed because of its political implications. Two tracks, &quot;Where Is Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Stranded in Time&quot;, were written by Marron and Bogas. Byrd later described &quot;Stranded in Time&quot;, arranged by Marron, as &quot;a weak Beatle-esque copy of &#x27;Eleanor Rigby&#x27;, [which] could not be performed live because it called for string quartet. It should never have been included [on the album], but Dave Rubinson loved it.&quot;

The record was released in early 1968, at a time when there was a receptive audience for “underground music” which combined musical experimentalism with radical social and/or political lyricsother examples, in their very different ways, including the Velvet Underground (who shared a common background in the New York experimental music scene; according to Moskowitz, Nico at one point tried to join the USA), Frank Zappa (whom Byrd disliked, considering him a niche-marketer &quot;subsumed in a self-referential loop&quot;), Love&#x27;s &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, Country Joe and the Fish, and Jefferson Airplane.

The album is littered with references to Byrd&#x27;s obsession with old-time American music such as the Dixieland jazz intro on &quot;I Won&#x27;t Leave My Wooden Wife for You, Sugar&quot;. &quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&quot; starts out with five layers of sound being heard in a collage: a calliope playing &quot;National Emblem&quot;, a ragtime piano playing &quot;At a Georgia Camp Meeting&quot;, two marching bands playing &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; and &quot;The Red, White and Blue&quot; switching between left and right channels. The other two tracks are of electronic sounds. The marching bands were arranged and conducted by Byrd, rather than being taken from existing recordings. 

Whether intended or not, the record took the form of a coherent song cycle, a radical commentary on contemporary American society. The words ranged from satires on decadence (&quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&quot;, &quot;... Wooden Wife...&quot; (this title being a parody of the 1905 music hall song &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Leave My Little Wooden Hut for You&quot; by Tom Mellor and Charles Collins)) to lyrical expressions of longing (the pastoral &quot;Cloud Song&quot;, the political &quot;Love Song for the Dead Che&quot;). Musically, the songs ranged from pseudo-classical elegance (&quot;Stranded in Time&quot; and &quot;Where Is Yesterday&quot;) to aggressive discordance and hard rock (&quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot; and &quot;Hard Coming Love&quot;), with heavy electronic distortion and collages of music such as brass bands, in line with Byrd being heavily influenced by Charles Ives. The final suite, &quot;The American Way of Love&quot;, integrates most of these elements, with a dreamlike ending containing a collage of earlier tracks. According to Lillian Roxon, the three-part suite &quot;dealt most explicitly with the activities of homosexual prostitutes on New York&#x27;s notorious 42nd Street&quot;.

===Break-up===
The band fell apart shortly after their album was released. One factor was disagreement between Byrd, Marron and Bogas over musical direction, with Marron&#x27;s promotion of lighter &quot;McCartney-esque&quot; material conflicting with Byrd&#x27;s original vision for the band, and conversely Marron and Bogas becoming unhappy with the priority given to Byrd&#x27;s songs. Dissent led to a backstage fist fight between Marron and Byrd after the band&#x27;s performance supporting the Troggs at the Fillmore East, when the English band&#x27;s fans had heckled the United States of America and Byrd and Marron competed against each other in turning up the volumes on their amplifiers. At another show in Orange County, band members were busted for smoking marijuana during the show, leading to it having to be completed by just Moskowitz and Byrd, who later complained that Marron, Forbes and Woodson were &quot;often sloppy in performance&quot; as a result of their drug use.

There were tensions between Byrd on one side, and Moskowitz and Rubinson on the other. Byrd commented that &quot;as I tried to make our sound &quot;harder&quot;, Dorothy was trying to go softer, perhaps responding to an unconscious influence of autobiographic women songwriters of the time: Janis Ian, Laura Nyro, and Joni Mitchell.&quot; According to Byrd, there was a lack of enthusiasm for the band from the record company, who felt challenged by both the band&#x27;s music and Byrd&#x27;s politics. In contrast, Moskowitz has said that the company were &quot;just trying to market us&quot;, and &quot;we were the ones who were being sanctimonious... [and] rigid...&quot;, also claiming that producer Rubinson lost interest in the band after Agnello left. A further factor was other band members&#x27; unhappiness with the initial mixing of the album in New York City by Byrd and Rubinson, which, when played back in Los Angeles, according to Byrd, sounded &quot;utterly wimpy and lame. The band blamed me, and they were right. My credibility with my own musicians suffered immeasurably.&quot;

Moskowitz has referred to the band&#x27;s &quot;internal conflicts, fisticuffs and power struggles.&quot; Byrd has claimed that &quot;Columbia dumped me from the band&quot;; specifically, that Rubinson and the band&#x27;s manager Malcolm Terrence manoeuvered to remove him, and promote Moskowitz as the band&#x27;s figurehead and potential solo star. Though Moskowitz disputes that claim, she also said that &quot;although I didn&#x27;t agree with David [Rubinson] aesthetically, I felt loyal to him. He was, after all, the one who had put us on the map.&quot; In any event, Byrd announced that he was leaving, and, according to Moskowitz, when he changed his mind, &quot;the manager pleaded with me to accept him back, but I wouldn&#x27;t. There was never a conspiracy towards a solo career or some &#x27;back story&#x27; between Rubinson and myself. It was primarily intransigence and anger about band governance on my part that propelled the final train wreck.&quot; 
Byrd subsequently commented: &quot;The idea was to create a radical experience. It didn&#x27;t succeed. For one thing, I had assembled too many personalities; every rehearsal became group therapy. A band that wants to succeed needs a single, mutually acceptable identity. I tried to do it democratically, and it was not successful.&quot; Rubinson said: &quot;Joe Byrd was one of the most insane examples of control freak that I&#x27;ve, to this day, ever experienced... he was really bizarre, and a very, very difficult person to deal with. So there were constant personality conflicts in and among the band. People quitting, people getting replaced, arguments, yelling about intonation, and so forth. They were very talented people, and I don&#x27;t think they liked being dictated to. But he had a vision of what he wanted.&quot;

Marron, Forbes and Bogas left the band after their East Coast tour in spring 1968. After Byrd also left, Rubinson and Moskowitz attempted to keep the band name alive, and Moskowitz recorded several tracks in July 1968 with a new and more conventional band of Los Angeles musicians: Jeff Marinell (guitar), Richard Grayson (keyboard), Carmie Simon (bass), and Dennis Wood (drums). Their recordings surfaced on the 2004 CD reissue of &quot;The United States of America&quot;. However, plans to continue with the band soon came to nothing.

==Reception and legacy==
The album was described by critic Richie Unterberger as &quot;a near classic&quot;, &quot;a tour de force (though not without its flaws) of experimental rock that blended surprisingly melodic sensibilities with unnerving blasts of primitive synthesizers and lyrics that could range from misty romanticism to hard-edged irony. For the relatively few who heard it, the record was a signpost to the future with its collision of rock and classical elements, although the material crackled with a tension that reflected the United States of America itself in the late &#x27;60s.&quot; Describing Moskowitz&#x27;s vocals as &quot;reminiscent of an icier Grace Slick&quot;, he also said that the electronic textures crafted by Byrd &quot;were not simulations of strings and horns, but exhilarating, frightening swoops and bleeps that lent a fierce crunch to the faster numbers, and a beguiling serenity to the ballads.&quot;

According to Unterberger, &quot;the very fact that the equipment was so primitive... lent a spontaneous resonance and warmth that has rarely been achieved by subsequent synthesizer technology.&quot; Producer David Rubinson commented:
According to critic Kevin Holm-Hudson, &quot;what distinguishes the United States of America from some of its contemporaries... is the seriousness and skill with which they incorporated avant-garde and other influences into their music.&quot;

Despite the widespread support of music critics, the album sold poorly and soon disappeared—at least in the US, although in the UK it remained fondly remembered, in part because of one track (&quot;Wooden Wife&quot;) being used on a popular budget-price CBS sampler album, &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot;. The band was later described as an influence by several British bands, including Portishead and Broadcast. The band&#x27;s album was first reissued on CD in 1997, and in an expanded edition by Sundazed Music in 2004.

==Later activities==
*Joseph Byrd (born 1937) went on to record a second album for Columbia, &quot;The American Metaphysical Circus&quot;, credited to Joe Byrd and the Field Hippies, in 1969. Byrd also released a number of additional recordings under his own name, as well as scoring films, writing music for television and commercials, and working as a music producer. In the 1970s he founded the Yankee Doodle Society, dedicated to the popular music of the mid-19th century, and released several albums of songs of the period. He is married, lives in northern California near the Oregon border, and since 2000 has taught music-related classes at College of the Redwoods.
*Dorothy Moskowitz (born 1940) later became a member of Country Joe McDonald&#x27;s All-Star Band, touring and recording with them and appearing on McDonald&#x27;s 1973 album, &quot;Paris Sessions&quot;. She also composed theater music, recorded commercials, and sang jazz in clubs. She married in 1978, taking the name Dorothy Falarski, and had two daughters. She began writing music for children in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, she became a music teacher for elementary schools in Piedmont, California, introducing students to the basics of brass instruments and vocal techniques. She has developed a number of other music projects in the San Francisco Bay area and lives in a suburb of Oakland, California.
*Gordon Marron (born 1943) became a Los Angeles studio musician on recordings by David Ackles, Carole King, Alice Coltrane, Helen Reddy and others. He co-wrote the Vic Dana song &quot;The Love in Your Eyes&quot;, and worked on film soundtracks with composer Reid Reilich. He later moved to Kauai, Hawaii, where he continues to perform on violin and keyboards.
*Craig Woodson (born 1943) gained a doctorate from UCLA and recorded with David Ackles, Linda Ronstadt and others before starting a small business making ethnic musical instruments in the 1970s. He also worked as a percussion teacher, lecturer and consultant, as well as presenting educational concerts and touring with the Kronos Quartet. He won several patents for musical instrument technology, and led a three-year project in Ghana producing instruments for use in local schools. He founded Ethnomusic, Inc., a world music education consultancy, in 1976. For two years, he was senior director of education at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He later lived in Ohio. In 1998, Woodson arranged a ceremony to apologise for his white ancestors&#x27; involvement in the slavery that had oppressed members of Carter G. Woodson&#x27;s family. Following the reconciliation, both sides of the family developed the Black White Families Reconciliation (BWFR) Protocol, using the creative arts, particularly drumming and storytelling, with the aim of healing racial divides within black and white families who share a surname.
*Ed Bogas (born 1942) composed soundtracks for &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Garfield&quot; TV cartoon specials and for Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s film &quot;Fritz the Cat.&quot;
*Rand Forbes (January 28, 1947–December 23, 2020) became a software engineer. He worked as an Oracle database administrator, and owned a software development company. He later lived in the Cleveland, Ohio area, close to Craig Woodson. He died in 2020 following a lengthy illness and after contracting COVID-19.

<text>IBM i (the &quot;i&quot; standing for &quot;integrated&quot;) is an operating system developed by IBM for IBM Power Systems. It was originally released in 1988 as OS/400, as the sole operating system of the IBM AS/400 line of systems. It was renamed to i5/OS in 2004, before being renamed a second time to IBM i in 2008. It is an evolution of the System/38 CPF operating system, with compatibility layers for System/36 SSP and AIX applications. It inherits a number of distinctive features from the System/38 platform, including the Machine Interface which provides hardware independence, the implementation of object-based addressing on top of a single-level store, and the tight integration of a relational database into the operating system.

==History==

===Origin===

OS/400 was developed alongside the AS/400 hardware platform beginning in December 1985. Development began in the aftermath of the failure of the Fort Knox project, which left IBM without a competitive midrange system. During the Fort Knox project, a skunkworks project was started at Rochester by engineers, who succeeded in developing code which allowed System/36 applications to run on top of the System/38, and when Fort Knox was cancelled, this project evolved into an official project to replace both the System/36 and System/38 with a single new hardware and software platform. The project became known as &quot;Silverlake&quot; (named for Silver Lake in Rochester, Minnesota).

The operating system for Silverlake was codenamed &quot;XPF&quot; (Extended CPF), and had originally begun as a port of CPF to the Fort Knox hardware. In addition to adding support for System/36 applications, some of the user interface and ease-of-use features from the System/36 were carried over to the new operating system.
Silverlake was available for field test in June 1988, and was officially announced in August of that year. By that point, it had been renamed to the &quot;Application System/400&quot;, and the operating system had been named &quot;Operating System/400&quot;.

===The move to PowerPC===

The port to PowerPC required a rewrite of most of the code below the TIMI. Early versions of OS/400 inherited the Horizontal and Vertical Microcode layers of the System/38, although they were renamed to the &quot;Horizontal Licensed Internal Code&quot; (HLIC) and &quot;Vertical Licensed Internal Code&quot; (VLIC) respectively. The port to the new hardware led to the IMPI instruction set and the horizontal microcode implementing it being replaced by the PowerPC AS instruction set and its implementation in PowerAS processors. This required the VLIC to be rewritten to target PowerPC instead of IMPI, and for the operating system functionality previously implemented in the HLIC to be re-implemented elsewhere. This led to the HLIC and VLIC being replaced with a single layer named the &quot;System Licensed Internal Code&quot; (SLIC). The SLIC was implemented in an object-oriented style with over 2 million lines of C++ code, replacing some of the HLIC code, and most of the VLIC code. Owing to the amount of work needed to implement the SLIC, IBM Rochester hired several hundred C++ programmers for the project, who worked on the SLIC in parallel to new revisions of the VLIC for the CISC AS/400 systems. The first release of OS/400 to support PowerPC-based hardware was V3R6.

===Rebranding===


The AS/400 product line was rebranded multiple times throughout the 1990s and 2000s. As part of the 2004 rebranding to &quot;eServer i5&quot;, OS/400 was renamed to &quot;i5/OS&quot;; the &quot;5&quot; signifying the use of POWER5 processors. The first release of i5/OS, V5R3, was described by IBM as &quot;a different name for the same operating system&quot;.

In 2006, IBM rebranded the AS/400 line one last time to &quot;System i&quot;. In April 2008, IBM consolidated the System i with the System p platform to create IBM Power Systems. At the same time, i5/OS was renamed to &quot;IBM i&quot;, in order to remove the association with POWER5 processors. The two most recent versions of the operating system at that time, which had been released as i5/OS V5R4 and V6R1, were renamed to IBM i 5.4 and 6.1.

Along with the rebranding to IBM i, IBM changed the versioning nomenclature for the operating system. Prior releases used a &quot;Version, Release, Modification&quot; scheme, e.g. V2R1M1. This was replaced with a &quot;Version.Release&quot; scheme, e.g. 6.1. Beginning with IBM i 7.1, IBM replaced the Modification releases with &quot;Technology Refreshes&quot;. Technology Refreshes are delivered as optional PTFs for specific releases of the operating system which add new functionality or hardware support to the operating system.

==Architecture==

When IBM i was first released as OS/400, it was split into two layers, the hardware-dependent &quot;System Licensed Internal Code&quot; (SLIC) and the hardware-independent &quot;Extended Control Program Facility&quot; (XPF). These are divided by a hardware abstraction layer called the &quot;Technology Independent Machine Interface&quot; (TIMI). Later versions of the operating system gained additional layers, including an AIX compatibility layer named &quot;Portable Application Solutions Environment&quot; (originally known as the &quot;Private Address Space Environment&quot;), and the &quot;Advanced 36 Machine&quot; environment which ran System/36 SSP applications in emulation.

IBM often uses different names for the TIMI, SLIC and XPF in documentation and marketing materials, for example, the IBM i 7.4 documentation refers to them as the &quot;IBM i Machine Interface&quot;, &quot;IBM i Licensed Internal Code&quot; and &quot;IBM i Operating System&quot; respectively.

===Technology Independent Machine Interface (TIMI)===

The TIMI isolates users and applications from the underlying hardware. This isolation is more thorough than the hardware abstractions of other operating systems, and includes abstracting the instruction set architecture of the processor, the size of the address space and the specifics of I/O and persistence. This is accomplished through two interrelated mechanisms:

* Compilers for IBM i do not generate native machine code directly, instead they generate a high level intermediate representation defined by the TIMI. When a program is run, the operating system carries out ahead-of-time translation of the TIMI instructions into native machine code for the processor, and stores the generated machine code for future execution of the program. If the translation process changes, or a different CPU instruction set is adopted, the operating system can transparently regenerate the machine code from the TIMI instructions without needing to recompile from source code.
* Instead of operating on memory addresses, TIMI instructions operate on &quot;objects&quot;. All data in IBM i, such as data files, source code, programs and regions of allocated memory, are encapsulated inside objects managed by the operating system (cf. the &quot;Everything is a file&quot; model in Unix). IBM i objects have a fixed type, which defines the set of applicable operations which may be carried out on them (for example, a &quot;Program&quot; object can be executed, but cannot be edited). The object model hides whether data is stored in primary, or secondary storage. Instead, the operating system automatically handles the process of retrieving and then storing the changes to permanent storage.

The hardware isolation provided by the TIMI allowed IBM to replace the AS/400&#x27;s 48-bit IMPI architecture with the 64-bit RS64 architecture in 1995. Applications compiled on systems using the IMPI instruction set could run on top of the newer RS64 systems without any code changes, recompilation or emulation, while also allowing those applications to avail of 64-bit addressing.

There are two different formats of TIMI instructions, known as the &quot;Original Machine Interface&quot; (OMI) and &quot;New Machine Interface&quot; (NMI) formats. OMI instructions are essentially the same as the System/38 Machine interface instructions, whereas NMI instructions are lower-level, resembling the &quot;W-code&quot; intermediate representation format used by IBM&#x27;s compilers. IBM partially documents the OMI instructions, whereas the NMI instructions are not officially documented. OMI instructions are used by the original AS/400 compilers, whereas NMI instructions are used by the Integrated Language Environment compilers. During the PowerPC port, native support for the OMI format was removed, and replaced with a translator which converted OMI instructions into NMI instructions.

The storing of the TIMI instructions alongside the native machine code instructions is known as &quot;observability&quot;. In 2008, the release of i5/OS V6R1 (later known as IBM i 6.1) introduced a number of changes to the TIMI layer which caused problems for third-party software which removed observability from the application objects shipped to customers.

===SLIC===

The SLIC consists of the code which implements the TIMI on top of the IBM Power architecture. In addition to containing most of the functionality typically associated with an operating system kernel, it is responsible for translating TIMI instructions into machine code, and it also implements some high level functionality which is exposed through the TIMI, such as IBM i&#x27;s integrated relational database. The SLIC implements IBM i&#x27;s object-based storage model on top of a single-level store addressing scheme, which does not distinguish between primary and secondary storage, and instead manages all types of storage in a single virtual address space. The SLIC is primarily implemented in C++, and replaced the HLIC and VLIC layers used in versions of OS/400 prior to V3R6.

===XPF===

The XPF consists of the code which implements the hardware-independent components of the operating system, which are compiled into TIMI instructions. Components of the XPF include the user interface, the Control Language, data management and query utilities, development tools and system management utilities. The XPF also contains the &quot;System/36 Environment&quot; and &quot;System/38 Environment&quot;, which provide backwards compatibility APIs and utilities for applications and data migrated from SSP and CPF systems. The XPF is IBM&#x27;s internal name for this layer, and as the name suggests, began as an evolution of the System/38 Control Program Facility. The XPF is mostly implemented in PL/MI, although other languages are also used.

===PASE===

PASE (Portable Applications Solutions Environment) provides binary compatibility for user mode AIX executables which do not interact directly with the AIX kernel, and supports the 32-bit and 64-bit AIX Application Binary Interfaces. PASE was first included in a limited and undocumented form in the V4R3 release of OS/400 to support a port of Smalltalk. It was first announced to customers at the time of the V4R5 release, by which time it had gained significant additional functionality.

PASE consists of the AIX userspace running on top of a system call interface implemented by the SLIC. The system call interfaces allows interoperability between PASE and native IBM i applications, for example, PASE applications can access the integrated database, or call native IBM i applications, and vice versa. During the creation of PASE, a new type of single level storage object named a &quot;Teraspace&quot; was added to the operating system, which allows each PASE process to have a private 1TiB space which is addressed with 64-bit pointers. This was necessary since all IBM i jobs (i.e. processes) typically share the same address space. PASE applications do not use the hardware-independent TIMI instructions, and are instead compiled directly to Power machine code.

Ports of open source software to IBM i typically target PASE instead of the native IBM i APIs in order to simplify porting. Open source software for IBM i is typically packaged using the RPM package format, and installed with the YUM package manager.

PASE is distinct from the Qshell environment, which is an implementation of a Unix shell and associated utilities built on top of IBM i&#x27;s native POSIX-compatible APIs.

=== Advanced 36 Machine ===

Introduced in 1994, the Advanced/36 platform ran unmodified System/36 applications and the SSP operating system in emulation on top of the OS/400 SLIC using hardware which was mostly identical to that of contemporary AS/400 systems. This functionality was incorporated into OS/400 itself from V3R6 through V4R4, making it possible to run up to four System/36 &quot;virtual machines&quot; (to use IBM&#x27;s term) using the so-called &quot;Advanced 36 Machine&quot; feature of the operating system. Support was discontinued in the V4R5 release, coinciding with IBM&#x27;s discontinuation of the Advanced/36 product line as a whole. The Advanced 36 Machine feature is distinct from the System/36 Environment introduced in the initial OS/400 release and still supported in current IBM i versions.

Prior to the Advanced/36, the System/36 line used two different processors in each system - the Main Storage Processor (MSP) which ran most of the SSP operating system as well as user code, and the Control Storage Processor (CSP) which ran so-called &quot;microcode&quot; which implemented core operating system functionality as well as I/O. The CSP microcode was invoked from the MSP through the use of the Supervisor Call (SVC) instruction. On the Advanced/36, the CSP microcode was reimplemented inside the SLIC. An MSP emulator was also built into the SLIC, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Technology Independent Emulation Interface&quot;. Even with the overhead of emulation, the Advanced/36 systems were significantly faster than the original System/36 systems they replaced due to the performance of their PowerPC AS processors.

==Features==

===Database management===

IBM i features an integrated relational database currently known as IBM Db2 for IBM i. The database evolved from the non-relational System/38 database, gaining support for the relational model and SQL. The database originally had no name, instead it was described simply as &quot;data base support&quot;. It was given the name &quot;DB2/400&quot; in 1994 to indicate comparable functionality to IBM&#x27;s other commercial databases. Despite the Db2 branding, Db2 for IBM i is an entirely separate codebase to Db2 on other platforms, and is tightly integrated into the SLIC layer of IBM i as opposed to being an optional product.

IBM i provides two mechanisms for accessing the integrated database - the so-called &quot;native interface&quot;, which is based on the database access model of the System/38, and SQL. The native interface consists of the &quot;Data Description Specifications&quot; (DDS) language, which is used to define schemas and the codice_1 command or codice_2 query API. Certain Db2 for i features such as object-relational database management require SQL and cannot be accessed through the native interface. IBM i has two separate query optimizers known as the &quot;Classic Query Engine&quot; (CQE) and &quot;SQL Query Engine&quot; (SQE). These are implemented inside the SLIC alongside a &quot;Query Dispatcher&quot; which selects the appropriate optimizer depending on the type of the query. Remote access through the native interface and SQL is provided by the Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM) and Distributed Relational Database Architecture respectively.

A storage engine for MySQL and MariaDB named codice_3 allows applications designed for those databases to use Db2 for i as a backing store. Other open source databases have been ported to IBM i, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis. These databases run on the PASE environment, and are independent of the operating system&#x27;s integrated database features.

===Networking===

IBM i supports TCP/IP networking in addition to the proprietary IBM Systems Network Architecture.

IBM i systems were historically accessed and managed through IBM 5250 terminals attached to the system with twinax cabling. With the decline of dedicated terminal hardware, modern IBM i systems are typically accessed through 5250 terminal emulators. IBM provides two terminal emulator products for IBM i:
* IBM i Access Client Solutions is a Java-based client that runs on Linux, macOS and Windows to provide 5250 emulation.
* IBM i Access for Web/Mobile provides web-based 5250 emulation.

In addition, IBM provides a web-based management console and performance analysis product named IBM Navigator for i.

===Programming===

Programming languages available from IBM for IBM i include RPG, Control Language, C, C++, Java, EGL, COBOL, and REXX. Compilers were previously available for Pascal, BASIC, PL/I and Smalltalk but have since been discontinued. The Integrated Language Environment (ILE) allows programs from ILE compatible languages (C, C++, COBOL, RPG, and CL), to be bound into the same executable and call procedures written in any of the other ILE languages.

When PASE was introduced, it was necessary to compile code for PASE on an AIX system. This requirement was removed in OS/400 V5R2 when it became possible to compile code using the IBM XL compiler suite inside PASE itself. Since then, other compilers have been ported to PASE, including gcc.

Certain development tools for IBM i run on top of the operating system itself, such as the Source Edit Utility (SEU) text editor and Programming Development Manager. IBM also provides an Eclipse-based integrated development environment (IDE) for IBM i named IBM Rational Developer for i which runs on developer workstations instead of IBM i. Prior to the Eclipse-based IDE, IBM provided an IDE based on WorkFrame/2 which ran on OS/2 named &quot;CODE/400&quot; and an IDE based on VisualAge which ran on Microsoft Windows systems.

IBM i uses EBCDIC as the default character encoding, but also provides support for ASCII, UCS-2 and UTF-16.

===Storage===

In IBM i, disk drives may be grouped into an &quot;auxiliary storage pool&quot; (ASP) in order to organize data to limit the impact of storage-device failures and to reduce recovery time. If a disk failure occurs, only the data in the pool containing the failed unit needs to be recovered. ASPs may also be used to improve performance by isolating objects with similar performance characteristics, for example journal receivers, in their own pool.

By default, all disk drives are assigned to pool 1. The concept of IBM i pools is similar to the Unix/Linux concept of volume groups; however, with IBM i it is typical for all disk drives to be assigned to a single ASP.

===Security===

Security in IBM i is defined in terms of &quot;authorities&quot;, which represents the permission to carry out a specific action on a specific object. Authorities can be granted to individual users (known as &quot;user profiles&quot;), groups (known as &quot;group profiles&quot;) or all users (&quot;public&quot; authorities). Related objects can be grouped together in an &quot;authorization list&quot;, making it possible to grant authorities on all objects in the list by granting authorities on the authorization list.

User profiles have an associated &quot;user class&quot; which dictates the set of default authorities available to that user profile. There are five standard user classes which, in order of increasing privilege, are: &quot;Workstation User&quot;, &quot;System Operator&quot;, &quot;System Programmer&quot;, &quot;Security Administrator&quot; and &quot;Security Officer&quot;. IBM i ships with a default user profile for each user class, and the default Security Officer user profile, named codice_4, is the closest equivalent to the root user of a Unix-like operating system.

IBM i can be set to use one of five levels of security, which control the extent to which the operating system&#x27;s security features are enforced:

* &quot;Level 10&quot; – Users can log in without a password, and have full access to the system. If a user logs in with an unknown username, a new user profile will be automatically created.
* &quot;Level 20&quot; – Users must log in with a username and password of a known user profile, but will have almost full access to the system once logged in. Creation or modification of user profiles is restricted to user profiles which have been granted authorities for profile management. Limited access accounts can be created, which can be restricted to accessing certain objects, or running certain commands.
* &quot;Level 30&quot; – Authorities are enforced, meaning that users cannot access objects unless they have an authority for the object.
* &quot;Level 40&quot; – Access to certain system programs and MI instructions are restricted, and can only be used by operating system code.
* &quot;Level 50&quot; – Includes changes needed for the system to achieve TCSEC C2 compliance, and adds a security audit journal.

The first three levels correspond to the security levels available in CPF and the initial releases of OS/400. Security level 40 was added in OS/400 V1R3 and become the default security level for the operating system. The addition of Level 40 required the removal of the capability addressing model of the System/38 which was also present in earlier releases of OS/400. Security level 50 was added in V2R3 when OS/400 was certified to TCSEC C2 security.

<text>In mathematics, a ringed space is a family of (commutative) rings parametrized by open subsets of a topological space together with ring homomorphisms that play roles of restrictions. Precisely, it is a topological space equipped with a [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of rings called a structure sheaf. It is an abstraction of the concept of the rings of continuous (scalar-valued) functions on open subsets.

Among ringed spaces, especially important and prominent is a locally ringed space: a ringed space in which the analogy between the stalk at a point and the ring of germs of functions at a point is valid.

Ringed spaces appear in analysis as well as complex algebraic geometry and the scheme theory of algebraic geometry.

Note: In the definition of a ringed space, most expositions tend to restrict the rings to be commutative rings, including Hartshorne and Wikipedia. &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot;, on the other hand, does not impose the commutativity assumption, although the book mostly considers the commutative case.

==Definitions==
A ringed space formula_1 is a topological space &quot;formula_2&quot; together with a sheaf of rings formula_3 on formula_2. The sheaf formula_3 is called the structure sheaf of formula_2.

A locally ringed space is a ringed space formula_1 such that all stalks of formula_3 are local rings (i.e. they have unique maximal ideals). Note that it is &quot;not&quot; required that formula_9 be a local ring for every open set formula_10&quot;;&quot; in fact, this is almost never the case.

==Examples==
An arbitrary topological space &quot;formula_2&quot; can be considered a locally ringed space by taking &quot;formula_3&quot; to be the sheaf of real-valued (or complex-valued) continuous functions on open subsets of &quot;formula_2&quot;. The stalk at a point formula_14 can be thought of as the set of all germs of continuous functions at &quot;formula_14&quot;; this is a local ring with the unique maximal ideal consisting of those germs whose value at &quot;formula_14&quot; is formula_17.

If &quot;formula_2&quot; is a manifold with some extra structure, we can also take the sheaf of differentiable, or holomorphic functions. Both of these give rise to locally ringed spaces.

If &quot;formula_2&quot; is an algebraic variety carrying the Zariski topology, we can define a locally ringed space by taking formula_9 to be the ring of rational mappings defined on the Zariski-open set &quot;formula_10&quot; that do not blow up (become infinite) within formula_10. The important generalization of this example is that of the spectrum of any commutative ring; these spectra are also locally ringed spaces. Schemes are locally ringed spaces obtained by &quot;gluing together&quot; spectra of commutative rings.

==Morphisms==
A morphism from formula_1 to formula_24 is a pair formula_25, where formula_26 is a continuous map between the underlying topological spaces, and formula_27 is a morphism from the structure sheaf of formula_28 to the direct image of the structure sheaf of . In other words, a morphism from formula_1 to formula_24 is given by the following data:

* a continuous map formula_26
* a family of ring homomorphisms formula_32 for every open set formula_33 of formula_28 that commute with the restriction maps. That is, if formula_35 are two open subsets of formula_28, then the following diagram must commute (the vertical maps are the restriction homomorphisms):

There is an additional requirement for morphisms between &quot;locally&quot; ringed spaces:

*the ring homomorphisms induced by formula_37 between the stalks of &quot;formula_28&quot; and the stalks of &quot;formula_2&quot; must be &quot;local homomorphisms&quot;, i.e. for every &quot;formula_40&quot; the maximal ideal of the local ring (stalk) at formula_41 is mapped into the maximal ideal of the local ring at &quot;formula_40&quot;.

Two morphisms can be composed to form a new morphism, and we obtain the category of ringed spaces and the category of locally ringed spaces. Isomorphisms in these categories are defined as usual.

==Tangent spaces==
Locally ringed spaces have just enough structure to allow the meaningful definition of tangent spaces. Let &quot;formula_2&quot; be a locally ringed space with structure sheaf &quot;formula_3&quot;; we want to define the tangent space formula_45 at the point &quot;formula_40&quot;. Take the local ring (stalk) formula_47 at the point formula_14, with maximal ideal formula_49. Then formula_50 is a field and formula_51 is a vector space over that field (the cotangent space). The tangent space formula_45 is defined as the dual of this vector space.

The idea is the following: a tangent vector at &quot;formula_14&quot; should tell you how to &quot;differentiate&quot; &quot;functions&quot; at &quot;formula_14&quot;, i.e. the elements of &quot;formula_47&quot;. Now it is enough to know how to differentiate functions whose value at &quot;formula_14&quot; is zero, since all other functions differ from these only by a constant, and we know how to differentiate constants. So we only need to consider &quot;formula_49&quot;. Furthermore, if two functions are given with value zero at &quot;formula_14&quot;, then their product has derivative 0 at &quot;formula_14&quot;, by the product rule. So we only need to know how to assign &quot;numbers&quot; to the elements of formula_51, and this is what the dual space does.

==Modules over the structure sheaf==

Given a locally ringed space formula_1, certain sheaves of modules on &quot;formula_2&quot; occur in the applications, the &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules. To define them, consider a sheaf formula_64 of abelian groups on &quot;formula_2&quot;. If formula_66 is a module over the ring &quot;formula_9&quot; for every open set &quot;formula_10&quot; in &quot;formula_2&quot;, and the restriction maps are compatible with the module structure, then we call formula_64 an &quot;formula_3&quot;-module. In this case, the stalk of &quot;formula_64&quot; at &quot;formula_14&quot; will be a module over the local ring (stalk) &quot;formula_47&quot;, for every &quot;formula_40&quot;.

A morphism between two such &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules is a morphism of sheaves that is compatible with the given module structures. The category of &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules over a fixed locally ringed space formula_1 is an abelian category.

An important subcategory of the category of &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules is the category of &quot;quasi-coherent sheaves&quot; on &quot;formula_2&quot;. A sheaf of &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules is called quasi-coherent if it is, locally, isomorphic to the cokernel of a map between free &quot;formula_3&quot;-modules. A &quot;coherent&quot; sheaf &quot;formula_83&quot; is a quasi-coherent sheaf that is, locally, of finite type and for every open subset &quot;formula_10&quot; of &quot;formula_2&quot; the kernel of any morphism from a free &quot;formula_86&quot;-module of finite rank to &quot;formula_87&quot; is also of finite type.

<text>The Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA; ) is an international organisation with two primary functions surrounding use of the automobile. Its mobility division advocates the interests of motoring organisations, the automotive industry and motor car users in the fields of road safety and traffic circulation. The sport division is a governing body for many international motorsport championships and disciplines, including Formula One.

The FIA was formally established on 20 June 1904. It is headquartered at 8 Place de la Concorde, Paris, with offices in Geneva, Valleiry and London. The FIA consists of 245 member organisations in 149 countries worldwide. Its current president is Mohammed Ben Sulayem. The FIA is generally known by its French name or initials, even in non-French-speaking countries, but is occasionally rendered as International Automobile Federation.

Its most prominent role is in the licensing and sanctioning of Formula One, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, TCR World Tour, World Rallycross Championship, Formula E, and various other forms of racing. The FIA along with the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) also certify land speed record attempts. The International Olympic Committee provisionally recognised the federation in 2011, and granted full recognition in 2013.

== History ==
The &quot;Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus&quot; (AIACR, English: &#x27;International Association of Recognized Automobile Clubs&#x27;) was founded in Paris on 20 June 1904, as an association of national motor clubs. The association was designed to represent the interests of motor car users, as well as to oversee the burgeoning international motor sport scene.

In 1922, the AIACR established the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI), which would oversee international motorsport matters, such as setting the regulations for Grand Prix motor racing. Previously, this responsibility had been entrusted to the sporting commission of the Automobile Club de France. The World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship was introduced in 1925, replaced by the European Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1931 with a title awarded to the driver with the best results in the selected Grands Prix.

Upon resumption of motorsport after the Second World War, the AIACR was renamed the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile. The FIA established a number of championships in the following years; the World Championship for Drivers in 1950, and the World Championship for Sports Cars in 1953. That same year it also established the European Rally Championship, and then in 1963, the European Touring Car Challenge.

In 1962, the FIA created the Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK, also CIK-FIA), to oversee the growing karting discipline at international level, with a Nations Cup organised in the first year.

In 1978, Jean-Marie Balestre begun his presidency of the CSI, and it was renamed to &quot;Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile&quot; (FISA), with the intention of creating a governing body for automobile motor sport with some autonomy from the rest of the FIA, which retained control of the karting commission, CIK. Balestre believed motor sport was not being managed well and wanted to professionalise and commercialise the sport, particularly in Formula One which led to a dispute with participants known as the FISA–FOCA war. Balestre later took presidency of the FIA in 1985, managing presidencies of both federations simultaneously. He lost the FISA presidency in 1991, and the FIA presidency in 1993, to Max Mosley on both occasions. It was clear to both Balestre and Mosley, and agreed by the FIA General Assembly upon proposition that there was no need for two federations, and subsequent to Mosley&#x27;s FIA election, FISA was abolished in structural changes, bringing all motorsport under the control of the World Motor Sport Council.

In 1998, amidst the European Commission investigation, the FIA moved its headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland, outside the jurisdiction of the Commission. In 2001, the FIA moved back to Paris following the settlement however it retains its office in Geneva.

Also in 1998, the karting commission (CIK) gained some independence, becoming known as the Fédération Mondial de Karting (FMK, also known as FMK-FIA and distinct from separate organisations International Kart Federation and World Karting Association). However the Federation was short lived and in 2000, reverted back to being known as the CIK.

The FIA announced in 2022 the appointment of its first ever CEO, Natalie Robyn. Robyn resigned the position after 18 months and the position remains vacant.

== Organisational structure ==
=== General Assembly ===
The General Assembly is the Federation&#x27;s supreme governing body, consisting of representatives from each of the FIA&#x27;s member associations. According to the FIA&#x27;s website, the voting member associations can be automobile and touring clubs (mobility), or national sporting authorities (sport). The website further states that there are 243 organisations spread among 147 countries.

Meetings of the General Assembly are usually held once a year, though extraordinary meetings can be convened for urgent matters. The General Assembly has responsibility for amending the FIA&#x27;s statutes and regulations, approving the annual budget and reports, deciding upon the membership, and electing the officers and members to the Federation&#x27;s governing bodies.

=== Presidency ===
The head of the FIA and chairman of the General Assembly is the President, a position currently held by Mohammed bin Sulayem. The President coordinates the activities of the Federation and proposes resolutions to the various commissions and committees and also acts as the representative of the FIA to external organisations. They are supported by two Deputy Presidents and several vice-presidents, each for Sport or Mobility, as well as the President of the FIA Senate. The combined presidency is elected to a four-year term by the General Assembly. Presidential candidates must produce an electoral list consisting of their proposed Deputy Presidents, Vice-Presidents for Sport, and the President of the Senate, as well as demonstrate support from a number of member clubs.


=== World Councils ===
The FIA has two World Councils. The World Council for Automobile Mobility and Tourism (WCAMT) governs transport policy, road safety, tourism and environmental concerns. The World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) regulates all sporting disciplines claimed by the FIA, and approves the regulations for each of the FIA&#x27;s championships. Beneath the WMSC are a number of specialised commissions, which are either focused on individual championships, or general areas such as safety.

=== Senate ===
The FIA Senate generally oversees financial and commercial affairs and general management of the FIA, and can take decisions required between meetings of the relevant committee or World Council.

=== Administration ===
Sport and Mobility each have a Secretary General to head the administrative staff who function as intermediaries for the councils, commissions and committees. A Chief Administration Officer also heads areas supporting the Senate such as commercial, legal, marketing, events and financial.

=== Commissions ===
A number of commissions exist to further activities or aims within specific areas. Each may have their own presidency and could be broken down into further specific working groups. Individual members may be from member organisations joined by delegates and representatives from various professions or through a related connection such as being a motorsport competitor for example. Alongside the various Sporting and Mobility Commissions, the International Historical Commission exists for the preservation of historic vehicles.

=== Committees ===
Ten sports committees have been established by the World Motorsport Council to help manage and administer certain aspects of motorsport. An Ethics committee was also set up in 2012 by the General Assembly.

=== Judiciary ===
The FIA&#x27;s judicial bodies include the International Tribunal, which exercises disciplinary powers that are not dealt with by the meeting stewards, and the International Court of Appeal. The ICA is the final appeal tribunal for international motor sport, which resolves disputes brought before it by National Sporting Authorities worldwide, or by the President of the FIA. It can also settle non-sporting disputes brought by national motoring organisations affiliated to the FIA.

== Sporting governance ==

=== FIA World Motor Sport Council ===
The World Motor Sport Council (WMSC) has the decision-making responsibility for all motorsport the FIA governs and sanctions. It convenes at least three times a year to decide on rules and regulations proposed to it by the commissions and committees that have direct responsibility of the various disciplines and championships. The WMSC also discusses safety and development of motor sport and steers the commissions and committees through delegated tasks. The council consists of the President of the FIA, the Deputy President for Sport and seven Vice-Presidents as nominated by the President; five members by right and fourteen further members approved by the General Assembly.

==== World Championship Commissions ====
Each of the seven World Championships report directly to the WMSC, usually to propose amendments to their own rules and regulations.

==== WMSC Committees ====
Alongside the Manufacturer&#x27;s Committee, nine sporting committees report to the WMSC. The committees, shown below in bold, may have their own specialised commissions.

===2022 ban of Russian and Belarusian teams and competitions===

In response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FIA banned Russia and Belarus teams, and banned the holding of competitions in Russia or Belarus. It also excluded Russian and Belarusian FIA members from their roles as elected officers or commission members, and banned FIA grants to Russian and Belarusian members. Individual Russia and Belarus competitors were allowed to enter races as neutrals, without their national symbols, flags, colours and anthems. The FIA cancelled the 2022 edition of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, initially scheduled for 25 September. The FIA also terminated the Russian contract to host the race.

== FIA World Championships ==
The true history of Formula One began in the 1946 season with the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile″s (FIA&#x27;s) standardisation of rules for Formula One cars in Grand Prix racing. The first Grand Prix in accordance with this new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. Then in the 1950 season, the FIA organised the first World Championship for Drivers. From the 1958 season, a World Constructors&#x27; Championship title was introduced, named from the 1958 season to the 1980 season officially as the &quot;International Cup for Formula One Constructors&quot;. Formula One originated from the World Manufacturers&#x27; Championship (1925–1930) and European Drivers&#x27; Championship (1931–1939) which were organised by the &quot;AIACR&quot; (&quot;The Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus&quot;).

The World Sportscar Championship was created in the 1953 season, and was the first world championship for sports cars in endurance racing. The official name of the championship frequently varied throughout the period and from the 1962 season to the 1971 season the championship was officially known as the &quot;International Championship&quot;. The championship was solely for manufacturers up to the 1981 season when a Drivers Championship title was introduced. From the 1953 season to the 1984 season, titles were awarded to &quot;manufacturers&quot; of sports cars belonging to two main categories: sports prototypes (except for the 1978 to 1981 seasons) and GT cars (except for the 1953 to 1961 seasons and the 1982 season). From the 1985 season to the 1992 season, titles were awarded only to &quot;teams&quot; entering sports prototypes (instead of &quot;manufacturers&quot; of sports prototypes), excluding &quot;teams&quot; entering GT cars. After the 1992 season the World Sportscar Championship was cancelled and dissolved, revived again in the 2012 season under the new name as the FIA World Endurance Championship.

In the 1973 season, the FIA organised the first World Rally Championship beginning with the 42nd Rally of Monte-Carlo to replace the International Championship for Manufacturers. Initially the championship was solely for manufacturers. In the 1977 and 1978 seasons, an &quot;FIA Cup for Drivers&quot; was included before a Driver&#x27;s Championship title was introduced in the 1979 season.

In the 1987 season, the FIA sanctioned the World Touring Car Championship. Initially a one-off series for touring car racing, the title was revived in the 2005 season and discontinued at the end of the 2017 season.

In the 2010 season, the SRO Group introduced the FIA GT1 World Championship, which was a championship consisting of one-hour sprint races for GT cars. This world championship ended in the 2012 season. After a switch to GT3 cars in 2012 the series became known as the &quot;FIA GT Series&quot; in the 2013 season.

After the &quot;Automobile Club de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; (ACO) successfully organised the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup (ILMC) in the 2010 and 2011 seasons, the FIA and ACO organised together the rebirth of the defunct World Sportscar Championship (which was cancelled after the 1992 season) for both sports prototypes and GT cars from the 2012 season onward, now officially known as the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Starting in 2022 season, the FIA and FIM jointly sanctioned the World Rally-Raid Championship. With the Amaury Sport Organization (ASO) acting as promotor and organiser; the separate cross-country rallying series sanctioned by the FIA and FIM were dissolved and merged into the new World Championship.

===Carnet de Passages en Douane===

In 1913, the AIACR created the Carnet de Passages en Douane (CPD), allowing motorists to cross international borders into signatory territories for temporary periods without customs tariffs, duties or taxes payable on their personal vehicles. The CPD works like an insurance product, customs are guaranteed to be paid by the issuer if the vehicle does not leave the country within the specified time. Under the terms of the United Nations Customs Convention, only the FIA and the Alliance Internationale de Tourisme (AIT) may authorise carnet issuers.

=== NCAP Programmes ===
The FIA was a founder member of the European New Car Assessment Programme, a car safety programme that crash-tests new models and publishes safety reports on vehicles. Mosley was the first chairman of the organisation. The FIA later helped establish the Latin NCAP, ASEAN NCAP and Global NCAP.

== Initiatives ==

=== FIA Foundation ===
The FIA Foundation was established in 2001 as the FIA&#x27;s charitable arm. A registered charity in the United Kingdom, the foundation received a US$300 million grant from the sale of Formula One&#x27;s rights to fund research into road safety, the environmental impact of motoring, and to support sustainable motoring.
The Make Roads Safe campaign was set up in 2006 by the FIA Foundation, targeting the creation of safe roads across the world.

Critics see it as a tool of the motor industry to increase the acceptability of car-based traffic solutions while blocking alternatives.

=== Sport ===
Following the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, which saw the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, the FIA formed an Expert Advisory Safety Committee to research and improve safety in motor racing. Chaired by Formula One medical chief Professor Sid Watkins, the committee worked with the Motor Industry Research Association to strengthen the crash resistance of cars and the restraint systems and to improve drivers&#x27; personal safety. The recommendations of the committee led to significantly more stringent crash tests for racing vehicles, new safety standards for helmets and race suits, and the eventual introduction of the HANS device as compulsory in all international racing series. The committee also worked on improving circuit safety. This led to a number of changes at motor racing circuits around the world, and the improvement of crash barriers and trackside medical procedures.

==== FIA Institute ====
The FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety was established in 2004 with the focus of improving safety in motor sport, bringing together the various safety research groups into one organisation. It ceased prior to the 2017 motor sport season, with the Global Institute for Motor Sport Safety taking on its aims.

The FIA Institute Young Driver Excellence Academy begun in 2011 with the aim of developing driver talent worldwide. It ceased functioning after the 2015 season.

==Controversies==
===Formula One===
====FISA–FOCA war (1970s—1980s)====

The CSI determined the regulations and calendar of the major international championships, such as the Formula One World Championship, World Sportscar Championship and European Rally Championship. Meanwhile, the organisers of the individual races (for example local or national clubs) were responsible for accepting entries, paying prize money, and the general running of each event. In Formula One, this led to tension between the teams, which formed themselves into the Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) founded in 1974, event organisers and the CSI. The FIA and CSI were largely amateur organisations, and FOCA under the control of Bernie Ecclestone began to take charge of various aspects of organising the events, as well as setting terms with race organisers for the arrival of teams and the amount of prize money. This led to the FIA President Prince Metternich attempting to reassert its authority by appointing Jean-Marie Balestre as the head of the CSI in 1978, who promptly reformed the committee into the autonomous Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA).

Under Balestre&#x27;s leadership FISA and the manufacturer-backed teams became involved in a dispute with FOCA (named the &quot;FISA–FOCA war&quot;). The conflict saw several races being cancelled or boycotted, and large-scale disagreement over the technical regulations and their enforcement. The dispute and the Concorde Agreement that was written to end it, would have significant ramifications for the FIA. The agreement led to FOCA acquiring commercial rights over Formula One, while FISA and the FIA would have control over sport&#x27;s regulations. FOCA chief Bernie Ecclestone became an FIA Vice-President with control over promoting the FIA&#x27;s World Championships, while FOCA legal advisor and former March Engineering manager Max Mosley would end up becoming FISA President in 1991. Mosley succeeded Balestre as President of the FIA in 1993 and restructured the organisation, dissolving FISA and placing motor racing under the direct management of the FIA.

====Breakaway series (2000s)====
During the 2000s, the FIA and its president became increasingly embroiled in controversy over Formula One, while facing threats from teams to establish a breakaway series. A grouping of the car manufacturers involved in F1, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association, proposed a new world championship, which would allow them greater control over the regulations and revenue distribution. A new Concorde Agreement eventually ended the threat, but the breakaway series would resurface during each dispute between the FIA, teams and the Formula One Group. The FIA&#x27;s handling of the tyre situation at the 2005 United States Grand Prix was criticised. Mosley had refused any modification to the circuit or the holding of a non-championship event in place of the Grand Prix, having stated that running on an untested circuit was unsafe. The FIA also threatened to punish the teams who withdrew from the event, but later cleared the teams of any wrongdoing.

====2007 Formula One espionage==== 
In 2007 and 2008 the FIA was criticised on two issues. The 2007 Formula One espionage controversy involved accusations against McLaren, who were accused of stealing technological secrets from Ferrari. Commenting on how the FIA handled the situation, Martin Brundle wrote a column in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; titled &quot;Witch-hunt threatens to spoil world title race&quot; in which he accused the FIA of a witch-hunt against McLaren. The World Motor Sport Council responded by issuing a writ against &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; alleging libel. Brundle responded by saying &quot;I have earned the right to have an opinion&quot;, and suggested the writ was a &quot;warning sign to other journalists&quot;.

====FIA–FOTA war (2000s—2010s)====

The FIA–FOTA dispute was a series of clashes between the FIA and the now defunct Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) over proposed changes to the rules and regulations for the 2010 Formula One season. The debate began over the introduction of a budget cap and escalated until the eve of the 2009 British Grand Prix with the FOTA teams announcing their intention to form their own rival breakaway series. The FIA in response began an entry process for new teams. From that point onwards, the dispute was negotiated to the point at which a new Concorde Agreement was signed in August 2009, with the budget cap replaced by a series of cost-cutting measures.

=== European Commission investigation ===
The Competition Directorate of the European Commission and the FIA were involved in a dispute over the commercial administration of motorsport during the 1990s. The Competition Commissioner, Karel Van Miert had received a number of complaints from television companies and motorsport promoters in 1997 that the FIA had been abusing its position as motorsport&#x27;s governing body. Van Miert&#x27;s initial inquiry had not concluded by 1999, which resulted in the FIA suing the European Commission, alleging that the delay was causing damaging uncertainty, and successfully receiving an apology from the Commission over the leaking of documents relating to the case. Mario Monti took over as Commissioner in 1999, and the European Commission opened a formal investigation into the FIA. The Commission alleged a number of breaches of European competition law, centred around the FIA&#x27;s administration of licences required to participate in motorsport and the control of television rights of the motorsport events it authorised. In order to compete in events the FIA authorised, the competitor had to apply for a licence, which prohibited licensees from entering a series not controlled by the FIA. This provision, which also applied to racing circuits and promoters, prevented rival championships competing against the FIA championships by restricting their access to facilities, drivers, and vehicle manufacturers. In addition, the FIA also claimed the television rights to all international motorsport events, which were then transferred to International Sportsworld Communicators, a company controlled by Ecclestone. This meant organisers were forced into having their championships promoted by the same company that managed the affairs of other motorsport events, a potential conflict of interest. The combination of these requirements meant Ecclestone&#x27;s Formula One Administration, which now controlled Formula One&#x27;s commercial rights, was protected from competition from any rival championships.

The investigation was closed in 2001 after the FIA and FOA agreed to a number of conditions. In order to fairly regulate all international motorsport, the FIA agreed to limit its role to that of a sporting regulator, and would sell the commercial rights to its championships, including Formula One. This was to prevent a conflict of interest between the FIA&#x27;s regulatory role and any commercial advantages it may gain from the success of certain championships. The FIA could no longer prevent non-FIA administered events from being established, neither could it use its powers to prevent competition to Formula One. Ecclestone and FOA would no longer handle the commercial rights to other motorsport events outside of Formula One. Ecclestone had sold the ISC company, which now only controlled the rights to rallying, and would stand down from his role as an FIA Vice-President. As a result of this ruling, the FIA sold the commercial rights to Formula One to the Formula One Group for 100 years for $360 million.

===Max Mosley sex scandal===
In 2008, accusations surfaced in the British media that FIA president Max Mosley was involved in scandalous sexual behaviour. In response, Mosley faced a leadership challenge in a vote of confidence at the June 2008 General Assembly. Mosley won the vote by 103 votes in support to 55 against, resulting in the retention of Mosley as president. However he continued to face criticism from several motoring clubs and motorsport figures. Germany&#x27;s ADAC (the largest European FIA member), announced, &quot;We view with regret and incredulity the FIA general assembly&#x27;s decision in Paris, confirming Max Mosley in office as FIA president&quot;. It froze all its activities with the FIA until Mosley left office.

<text>Athelney is a village located between the villages of Burrowbridge and East Lyng in Somerset, England. The name is believed to be derived from the Old English &quot;æþeling&quot; meaning &quot;prince&quot; + -&quot;ey&quot; meaning &quot;isle&quot;. The village is best known for once being the fortress hiding place of King Alfred the Great, from where he went on to defeat the Great Heathen Army at the Battle of Edington in May 878. 
==Isle of Athelney==
The area is known as the Isle of Athelney, because it was once a very low isolated island in the &#x27;very great swampy and impassable marshes&#x27; of the Somerset Levels. Much of the Levels are below the level of high tide. They are now drained for agricultural use during the summer, but are regularly flooded in the winter.

Archaeological excavations and written evidence indicate that at the time of Alfred the island was linked by a causeway, known as Balt Moor Wall, to East Lyng, with either end protected by a semi-circular stockade and ditch; the ditch on the island is now known to date from the Iron Age. It is therefore presumed that the island was known by Alfred to have been an ancient fort, and that its existing defences were strengthened by him. Evidence of metalworking on the site suggests that he also used the island to equip his army. When translated from the Anglo-Saxon, the name of the isle, &quot;Æthelinga īeg&quot;, is often thought to mean the &quot;Island of Princes&quot;; if correct this might suggest that the island had royal connections prior to Alfred.

To give thanks for his victory, Alfred founded a monastery, Athelney Abbey, on the Isle in 888, which lasted until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII in 1539, when the value of the rubble was put at £80.

After Athelney Abbey was dissolved, the monks built the church in the neighbouring village of East Lyng.

There are no remains of the monastery above ground, but investigations were carried out in the first episode of television archaeology programme &quot;Time Team&quot; in 1993. A decade later, in the one-hundredth episode, excavations were carried out. These revealed it as one of the only known Anglo-Saxon metalworking sites in the UK.

The monastery&#x27;s location was shown by a small monument on top of the isle in 1801 built by Sir John Slade, 1st Baronet of the Slade Baronets, on the site of a stone vault. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No 367) and Grade II listed building. The monument is now on private land belonging to Athelney Farm and is accessible via a permissive path past the farm.

Athelney is around from North Petherton, where the Alfred Jewel (an Anglo-Saxon ornament dating from the late 9th century) was discovered in 1693.

<text>West Chester Township is one of the thirteen townships of Butler County, Ohio, United States, located in the southwestern corner of the county. It is the most populous township in Ohio, with a population of 65,242 at the 2020 census. Situated between Sharonville and Liberty Township, West Chester is about north of Cincinnati and is included in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. Exits 19, 21 and 22 off Interstate 75 serve West Chester.

==History==
The thirteenth and last in order of creation, it was erected from Liberty Township by the Butler County Commissioners on June 2, 1823, upon petitions from residents of the township. No boundaries were given in the resolution passed by the commissioners, but it originally contained 35 square miles (91 km), just short of a full survey township. The new township was given the name &quot;Union.&quot; Because Union Township was familiarly known as West Chester, plus the abundance of other townships in Ohio called Union, the name was changed to West Chester Township effective June 28, 2000, after being ratified by the township&#x27;s voters at the March 9 primary election. Many census and government records, including the 2000 census, refer to Union Township. Today, it is the only West Chester Township statewide.

West Chester became the most populous township in Ohio at the 2010 census.

==Climate==
==Geography==
Located in the southeastern corner of the county, it borders the following townships and cities:
*Liberty Township - north
*Mason - east
*Deerfield Township, Warren County - east
*Sharonville - southeast
*Springdale - southwest
*Fairfield - west
*Fairfield Township - northwest

The southeastern corner of the township has been annexed by the city of Sharonville and a small portion in the west has been annexed by Fairfield.

The unincorporated communities of Maud, Port Union, Pisgah, and Tylersville are located in central, western, southwestern, and western West Chester Township respectively.

==Economy==

===Top employers===
According to West Chester&#x27;s 2020 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the township are:

===Household income===
==Government==
The township is governed by a three-member board of trustees, Mark Welch, Lee Wong, and Ann Becker, who are elected in November of odd-numbered years to a four-year term beginning on the following January 1. Two are elected in the year after the presidential election and one is elected in the year before it. There is also an elected township fiscal officer, who serves a four-year term beginning on April 1 of the year after the election, which is held in November of the year before the presidential election. Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees. Historically, West Chester Township has leaned toward the Republican Party but in recent years that advantage has narrowed. Barack Obama only won 35.2% of the vote against John McCain&#x27;s 63.5% in 2008, but in 2020 Joe Biden claimed 44% against Donald Trump&#x27;s 54.5%. West Chester Township is entirely in Ohio&#x27;s 8th congressional district.

Three times voters have rejected the incorporation of the township as a city. On February 2, 1988, the vote was 4,097 to 3,956 against incorporation; 5,816 to 4,972 against on August 8, 1989, and 5,054 to 4,679 against on August 3, 1993.

==Public services==
Formed in 1967, the township police department employs approximately 100 individuals. Led by Police Chief Joel Herzog, it is organized into three distinct bureaus: the Patrol Bureau, the Support Bureau, and the Administration Bureau.

The township was home to the Voice of America&#x27;s Bethany Relay Station, a facility covering 625 acres (2.5 km) in the northeast corner of the township that broadcast American propaganda overseas from 1943 to 1994. The property owned by the Voice of America Station has now been converted into Voice of America MetroPark. This park consists of a 1.42-mile walking trail around a lake. The Miami University Voice of America Learning Center was opened in 2009. The township is home to several parks in addition to Voice of America MetroPark, including Keehner Park. The township is also home to the Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati, which is one of the largest mosques in the area.

In 2006 ground was broken for &quot;The Square at Union Centre&quot; which serves as the town square for West Chester hosting events surrounded by class A office space and restaurants. The West Chester library is part of the square and a bell-tower constructed by the famous and historic Verdin Bell Company of Cincinnati serves as the centerpiece to the square.

Some of the township is in the West Chester post office (45069) and the southeastern corner is served by the Sharonville office (45241). Fairfield (45014) and Hamilton (45011 or 45015) also serve the township.

==Education==
Most of the township is in the Lakota Local School District, but portions are also in the Princeton City School District and a tiny part on the eastern border is in the Mason City School District. The Township&#x27;s two high school main campuses, Lakota East and Lakota West, are identical buildings that were built in 1997. As of 2022, the Lakota West High School Main Campus has 2,740 students. As of 2024, the principal at Lakota West High School is Scott Laman. Lakota West is classified by OHSAA as a Division 1 school. Lakota West High School is home to the 2007 Ohio State Baseball Champions, led by Coach Bill Dreisbach.

<doc id="248038" wikidata="Q1032442" url="?curid=248038" title="Canadian War Museum">
<text>The Canadian War Museum (CWM) () is a national museum on the country&#x27;s military history in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The museum serves as both an educational facility on Canadian military history and a place of remembrance. The museum building is situated south of the Ottawa River in LeBreton Flats. The museum houses a number of exhibitions and memorials, in addition to a cafeteria, theatre, curatorial and conservation spaces, as well as storage space. The building also houses the Military History Research Centre, the museum&#x27;s library and archives.

The Canadian War Museum was formally established in 1942, although portions of the museum&#x27;s collections originate from a military museum that operated from 1880 to 1896. The museum was operated by the Public Archives of Canada until 1967, when the National Museums of Canada Corporation was formed to manage several national institutions, including the war museum. In the same year, the war museum was relocated from its original building to the former Public Archives of Canada building. Management of the museum was later assumed by the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation (later renamed the Canadian Museum of History Corporation) in 1990. Plans to expand the museum during the mid-1990s resulted in the construction of a new building at LeBreton Flats. Designed by Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects and Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects, the new Canadian War Museum building was opened to the public in 2005.

The museum&#x27;s collection contains more than 500,000 items related to military history, including more than 13,000 works of military art. In addition to its permanent exhibition, the museum has hosted and organized a number of travelling exhibitions relating to Canadian military history.

==History==

===Background===
The collections of the Canadian War Museum originated from the collections of the Cartier Square Military Museum, established through a general order on 5 November 1880. Established with the intention to be a museum of national interest, the institution sought to preserve historical records and materials relating to the Canadian Militia, and any of its colonial predecessors. A proposal to establish a library operated by the museum was made in 1882, although these plans never came to fruition. As the museum continued to solicit donations for its collection the museum quickly outgrew its space in the drill hall, and appeals for a new facility were made by 1886. The museum was closed in 1896, to make room for a new shipment of Lee-Enfield rifles and space training.

The militia office originally intended for the museum to be relocated, storing its collections in an old military warehouse below Parliament Hill (present location of the Bytown Museum). In July 1901, the Department of Militia and Defence negotiated a lease to house the museum in a building in Ottawa. However, little effort was put into reopening the museum, with the department opting to not renew the building&#x27;s lease in 1905. On 26 January 1907, the Militia Council was informed by Eugène Fiset, the quartermaster-general of the Canadian Militia, that there was &quot;no interest being taken by the officers of the garrison&quot; to reopen the museum, and recommend to not reopening it.

The collection from the Cartier Square Military Museum remained at the warehouse until Dominion Archivist, Arthur Doughty, requested the transference of the items to the archives to display some of them. The militia approved the request, and transferred 105 items to the Dominion Archives between 1910 and 1919; although in doing so, the militia believed the archives had assumed responsibility for establishing any future military museum. By the 1910s, the militia began to redirect potential donors of military artifacts to the Dominion Archives.

These artifacts, in addition to captured German weapons from the First World War, were exhibited for the first time in a travelling exhibition in 1916. In December 1918, the Commission on War Records and Trophies was established to distribute German war trophies and war-related materials to memorials across Canada. However, the Commission retained several pieces at the Dominion Archives with the hope they would eventually be exhibited in a national museum. In 1924, the War Trophy Building was built adjacent to the original Dominion Archives building to house the military collection. In 1935, Doughty struck a deal with General Andrew McNaughton, the Chief of General Staff, for the militia to support the establishment of the museum. A War Trophies Review Board was established between the archives and militia, charged with selecting the best items to preserve for a future museum.

===Establishment===
The Canadian War Museum was formally opened at the War Trophies Building in January 1942; initially operated by the Dominion Archives, and partially funded by the Department of National Defence. In 1958, management of the Canadian War Museum was assumed by the National Museum of Canada (predecessor to the Canadian Museum of History and the Canadian Museum of Nature).

The museum relocated to the original Dominion Archives building, adjacent to the War Trophies building in June 1967; after the Public Archives of Canada moved its operations to a new facility. However, the museum continued to use the War Trophies building as a storage facility. In the same year, management of the war museum was assumed by the National Museums of Canada Corporation; a crown corporation which managed several national institutions, including the war museum.

In 1983 the museum relocated its storage facilities from the War Trophies building to Vimy House; with the former building demolished to make way for the National Gallery of Canada&#x27;s new building. In 1990, the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation (later renamed the Canadian Museum of History Corporation) was formed through &quot;The Museum Act&quot;, and assumed management of several national museums of Canada, including the war museum. 

By the 1990s, the museum&#x27;s staff had voiced that the space in the building was inadequate, with some areas of the building deemed environmentally hazardous for the exhibition of certain artifacts. In 1991, the government established the Task Force on Military History Museum Collections in Canada, whose final report called for more resources to be given to the museum, referring to its shape in the original Dominion Archives building as &quot;embarrassing,&quot; and a &quot;national disgrace.&quot; Although the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation invested C$1.7 million for new exhibit designs as a result of the report; funds remained limited for expansion, with the federal government implementing a number of austerity measures during the mid-1990s. A museum supporter&#x27;s group, the &quot;Friends of the Canadian War Museum&quot; was established in 1995 to assist the museum in fundraising efforts.

Between 1996 and 1997, the museum considered opening a large Holocaust exhibition within the museum. In addition to the exhibition, the architectural expansion plans released in November 1997 included enhanced exhibit spaces, a theatre, and a memorial chamber. However, the proposed exhibit was opposed by Canadian veterans, who felt a sense of neglect by the museum, and believed an exhibition on the Holocaust would further marginalize them; in addition to some historians who believed the museum was an inappropriate space for such an exhibition. Following events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War passed, public debate over the museum&#x27;s future intensified; with the Senate Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs convening a hearing in February 1998 to determine the future of the exhibition and the museum itself. Following the Senate Subcommittee hearings, the chair of the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, Adrienne Clarkson announced the museum would abandon its plans for a Holocaust exhibition, although proceed with its plans to expand the museum. 

Barney Danson was appointed to the board of trustees and the war museum advisory committee in 1998. This led to an increase in the museum&#x27;s research capacity and towards the establishment of the Centre of Military History. Danson later secured for the museum the acquisition of property near CFB Rockcliffe.

===21st century===
In March 2000, the Government of Canada formally announced plans to build a new museum building at CFB Rockcliffe. However, in 2001, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien intervened to have the proposed location changed to LeBreton Flats, a formerly industrial area of the city. LeBreton Flats was initially rejected as a site for the new museum building during the planning stages of the project as the site was contaminated. However, Chrétien proposed to decontaminate the site, with the museum serving as the centrepiece for the area&#x27;s revitalization efforts. In 2001, a design submitted by Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects and Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects was selected for the design of the new building. Groundbreaking for the new building took place in November 2002, followed by a major decontamination effort of the property by the National Capital Commission.

By 2004 the museum began to move its larger artifacts from its exhibits, as well as its storage facility into the new building. By the end of 2004, the museum closed its storage facility in Vimy House and closed its facility in the original Dominion Archives building in January 2005. The new building was opened on 8 May 2005, coinciding with the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe day. On the same day the new building was opened to the public, Canada Post issued a 50¢ stamp to commemorate the opening of the new museum. The total cost to build a new building for the museum, and the exhibitions was approximately C$135 million.

Shortly after its opening of the new building, the museum became the centre of controversy over its interpretation of the Combined Bomber Offensive during World War II, in which some 20,000 Canadians participated. Much of the controversy stemmed from two assertions made on a museum label, that the bombing offensive was largely ineffective until later in the war, and that its morality and value of strategic bombings remained contested. Complaints from Canadian veterans prompted another Senate Subcommittee to be launched. Museum staff eventually removed the offending museum label, replacing it with another label with text three times in length that &quot;glossed over the salient facts;&quot; although the offending images remained.

==Site==

The property is situated within LeBreton Flats, a neighbourhood within Ottawa, the capital city of Canada. The property is situated southwest of Parliament Hill and the National War Memorial. The property is bounded by roadways to the east and south, by the Capital Pathway, and the southern banks of the Ottawa River to the west and north. Water from the Ottawa River is drawn into the building for mechanical cooling, and ground irrigation of the larger property.

Directly south of the museum building is an urban park called &quot;The Commons&quot;, used for various events hosted by the museum. A wheelchair accessible pathway built around the building&#x27;s green roof connects &quot;The Commons&quot; with the parkland to the north of the museum.

===Building===
The was designed by Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects &amp; Griffiths Rankin Cook Architects; with Raymond Moriyama and Alex Rankin as the principal architect. Stantec was contracted as the civil engineering consultant, whereas PCL Construction was contracted as the project&#x27;s construction manager. The cost to construct the building was approximately C$96 million.

Regeneration served as the primary theme for the architectural design team of the building, with the design intended to showcase war&#x27;s impact on nature; and nature&#x27;s ability to regrow and &quot;regenerate&quot; from war. Tilted and jagged planes, along with roughhewn materials are used throughout the building in a form of &quot;controlled imperfection&quot;, intended to create the impression of trauma and disequilibrium. The building&#x27;s massing largely remains low to the ground, with only the building&#x27;s eastern portions only rising high above. A significant portion of the building is made out of concrete, with of cast-in-place concrete used throughout the building; in addition to 3,750 tonnes of reinforced steel. Many of the exterior and interior walls of the building are placed on a variety of angles, from 90 degrees to 31 degrees, with eight different angles in all used throughout the building.

====Exterior====

With regeneration being the primary theme of the architectural design, the external lines of the building were designed to evoke the &quot;devastations of war,&quot; with the building appearing to emerge from a &quot;scarred landscape&quot;. The angular building was designed to appear as if it was &quot;emerging from the Ottawa River. The highest point of the building rises off the ground, and faces towards the Canadian Parliament Buildings, and Peace Tower.

A self-seeding green roof, which connects to the surrounding parkland and riverfront, is also situated on the rooftop of the building. The green roof was incorporated into the museum building in order to reflect the building&#x27;s larger theme of regeneration; with the green rooftop intended to appear as nature fusing with ruins, showcasing the process of regeneration. The green roof also provides the building with some sustainability benefits; being an economical and efficient solution for stormwater management in the area, providing energy savings, and providing air pollution remediation. The roof was designed to mimic the urban development of the area, with the western portions of the rooftop closer to the rural areas of Ottawa designed to blend in with the surrounding parkland, while the eastern portion closer to downtown Ottawa features sloped concrete slopes that provide visitors with a view into the museum from the rooftop.

Nearly the entire southeastern façade of the building is covered in glass, providing people outside the museum a view of some of its items on display in the LeBreton Gallery, an open-storage exhibition space in the building. Near the top of the building&#x27;s walls are a series of small windows that spell out &quot;lest we forget/&quot;n&#x27;oublions jamais&quot;&quot; in Morse code. The exposed concrete board-form exterior is fitted with cast-in-place insulated concrete wall panels. Conversely, the entrance of the building is fitted with aluminum frames; with the canted curtain wall facing Parliament Hill.
====Interior====

The interior walls of the building are primarily made out of concrete that incorporates up to 15 per cent recycled fly ash, making the walls of the building a large energy-conserving mass. The walls are designed to emerge sharply from the ground, in an unusual fashion; whereas the floors were designed with slight slopes within them. Together, these design features are intended to evoke the feeling of instability with the museum&#x27;s visitors. All the galleries within the building include ramps and slopes, making all exhibits in the museum wheelchair accessible.

Concrete is a major material used in the museum&#x27;s lobby; with post-tensioned concrete beams extending throughout the foyer, in addition to 596 tonnes of exposed structural steel. One side of the lobby&#x27;s walls is textured and patterned like rough-hewn wooden planks, whereas the other side is patterned to resemble large blocks of quarried stone. In addition to concrete, copper that was originally used on the roof of the Library of Parliament is used on the walls of the museum lobby and the LeBreton Gallery. However, most of the building&#x27;s interior space remains austere, to provide visitors with a solemn space for reflection. A audio-visual presentation of what is contained inside the exhibits is situated at the access point from the main foyer to the exhibition areas.

Other educational facilities within the building include the Military History Resource Centre, a museum library and archive; and the 236-seat Barney Danson Theatre. The war museum&#x27;s theatre is named in honour of Barney Danson, in recognition of his efforts in supporting the Canadian War Museum. The building also includes a dedicated group entrance; and a sunlit cafeteria along the riverfront portion of the building, with a seasonal terrace; dedicated climate-controlled vaults; and laboratories for on-site repairs of artifacts. Including all areas of the museum, the total gross floor area of the museum building is .

==Exhibitions==
The Canadian War Museum functions as a history museum, and as a &quot;palace of memory&quot;. As a result, many of the museum&#x27;s permanent exhibitions function as both educational exhibits, and as a memorial. Permanent exhibitions at the museum include the &quot;Canadian Experience Galleries&quot;, &quot;Memorial Hall&quot;, &quot;Regeneration Hall&quot;, and the &quot;Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour&quot;. The &quot;Canadian Experience Galleries&quot; are a series of four Canadian military history galleries arranged chronologically. Memorial Hall is the only exhibition that is free to the public, with Memorial Hall being accessible through the lobby.

The permanent exhibitions at the museum were designed by Haley Sharpe Design, based in Leicester, UK, and Origin Studios, based in Ottawa. The design team, together with museum historians, crafted its exhibits in which the themes of brutality, geography, politics, and survival are woven throughout most of the exhibitions in the museum. The museum permanent exhibitions are divided into seven zones, and further subdivided into 25 themed clusters. Graphic interpretive information is spread throughout the exhibits in order to convey textual and visual information to visitors.

Exhibition design teams worked in conjunction with the architectural team for the new museum building, providing the exhibition design team with greater influence in how the exhibitions were arranged, positioned, and shaped; a degree of architectural influence not available to exhibition design teams working to fit exhibits in a pre-existing space. The exhibit structures, like the building itself, is angular and trapezoidal, reflecting the museum&#x27;s theme of regeneration, in addition to enhancing the themes of the exhibits. The exhibition areas in the museum feature austere lines of galvanized steel, concrete, wood, and other hard surfaces with strong, and deep colours. The exhibition areas&#x27; design was intended to provide visitors with &quot;little comfort or respite,&quot; with the &quot;fragmented structure of the exhibits,&quot; intended to the story of war. Although angular lines are prevalent throughout the design of the building and exhibitions, coloured curved structures are strategically placed throughout the galleries, acting as a counterpoint to the angular design of the building.

In addition to permanent exhibitions, the museum also organizes and hosts special and travelling exhibitions.

===Canadian Experience galleries===

The Canadian Experience galleries are a collection of four galleries that take up of space. The four galleries document the military history of Canada, with the four galleries being &quot;Early Wars in Canada&quot;, &quot;South African and the First World War&quot;, &quot;Second World War&quot;, and &quot;From the Cold War to the Present&quot;. Although some galleries are centred around individual conflicts, events involving Canadians serve as the focus for the galleries, with other events during these conflicts only being briefly addressed.

The galleries were intended to &quot;enhance the human experiences of war,&quot; documenting moments in Canadian military history that helped shape the country; with many of the exhibits drawing links to the events with larger themes of nationhood and national identity. Many of the exhibits were designed to simulate the &quot;collective perspective&quot; of Canadian service members, and Canadians in the to a lesser extent. The galleries are themed after four &quot;intertwined principles,&quot; geography, brutality, politics, and survival; with each principle serving as the leading theme for a gallery. Visitors are introduced to these principles before entering the galleries, with conceptual phrases relating to these principles printed on the walls of the rotunda outside the entrance of the Canadian Experience galleries.

The &quot;Early Wars in Canada&quot; gallery explores First Nations conflicts, as well as conflicts in New France and British North America, and post-confederated Canada in the 19th century. Many of the exhibits showcase how early conflicts in Canada were shaped by geography, and centred around lakes, streams, and rivers. Conflicts covered in this exhibit include the Beaver Wars, Anglo-French conflicts to the Seven Years&#x27; War, the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and the North-West Rebellion.

The &quot;South African and the First World War&quot; gallery explores Canadian participation in the Second Boer War and the First World War. The &quot;South African and the First World War&quot; gallery is styled to resemble Canada during Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee in 1897; intended to mimic the imperialistic fervour that existed during that period. In 2015, the museum opened a new portion of the gallery on the homefront during the First World War, highlighting the Conscription Crisis of 1917, the suffragette movement, and stories from individuals during the war.

The &quot;Second World War&quot; gallery explores the causes of the Second World War, as well as Canada&#x27;s participation during the conflict. Most of the Second World War exhibit focuses on Canada&#x27;s role in the Battle of the Atlantic, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the European theatre, the homefront and the internment of Japanese Canadians. Small portions of the exhibit are also dedicated to Canadian participation in the Asian and Pacific theatre, and the Holocaust. Objects from the museum&#x27;s collection exhibited in the Second World War portion of the Canadian Experience galleries includes a Mercedes-Benz 770K previously owned by Adolf Hitler, entitled &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Car: A Symbol of Evil&quot; at the exhibit. The museum acquired the Mercedes Benz 770K in 1970, under the assumption that the car formerly belonged to Hermann Göring; although a research report published in 1982 revealed that the vehicle belonged to Hitler. The gallery also houses an M4 Sherman tank named &quot;Forceful III&quot;, and is dedicated to the members of the Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards killed during the Second World War. A memorial plaque to Captain Thomas G. Fuller of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve is also present in the gallery.

The final gallery, &quot;From the Cold War to the Present&quot;, explored Canada&#x27;s role during the Cold War, and the threat of nuclear war in the public eye. In 2017, the concluding portion of the fourth gallery was updated to include post-Cold War conflicts involving members of the Canadian Armed Forces. The final portion of the gallery was designed to confront visitors with the problematic nature of warfare; and features an interactive space for visitors to leave their own reflections on war, peace, and remembrance.

===LeBreton Gallery===

The LeBreton Gallery: The Military Technology Collection is an open-space gallery housing several items of military equipment used by Canadians, or other military forces. Situated along the eastern portion of the museum, its eastern walls are made of glass, allowing natural sunlight to illuminate the gallery.

Equipment is organized into several sections, land, air, sea, field artillery, armoured fighting vehicles, cannon or mortar, and tanks. Most of the equipment in the gallery has been restored and cleaned, arranged and organized with museum labels which provide details on the equipment. The museum labels accompanying the pieces are focused primarily on the technical aspects of the equipment. The equipment housed in LeBreton Gallery is among the largest items in the museum&#x27;s collections and includes a McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo, 19th-century artillery pieces, tanks, and other military vehicles. The majority of the lighter wheeled and tracked transport vehicles on display date back to the Second World War or the Cold War era.

===Memorial Hall===

Situated within the lobby of the museum, Memorial Hall serves as a place for sombre reflection and remembrance. The exhibit&#x27;s access point is angled upwards; with its doorway designed to provide an illusion of narrowness. The walls surrounding the access point are cladded in copper and are illuminated only by light fixtures installed in the floor, and a light mounted on the ceiling. The portion of the museum where Memorial Hall is situated is also aligned on an axis with the Peace Tower of the Canadian Parliament Buildings.

Conversely, the walls inside Memorial Hall are made out of smooth concrete, with only a grid pattern resembling the headstones used for Canadian First World War soldiers etched into the walls. The exhibit is illuminated by a skylight which extends beyond from the building&#x27;s rooftop; while a glass-enclosed pool of water sits on the south side of Memorial Hall. The design of the exhibit was intended to provide visitors with the feeling of weightlessness. The exhibit contains a single artifact, the original headstone for the soldier eventually reburied at the Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The hall was designed so that sunlight that passes through the hall&#x27;s only window illuminates directly onto the headstone once a year, on 11 November at precisely 11 am, the time that the armistice that ended the First World War went into effect.

===Regeneration Hall===
Regeneration Hall is an exhibition located at the highest point of the museum building serving as a &quot;physical representation of hope for a better tomorrow&quot;. The walls of Regeneration Hall are angled in a manner similar to the buildings on Parliament Hill, with the Peace Tower visible through the eastern glass façade of the exhibition. The exhibition holds several artworks, including the original models for the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the painting &quot;Sacrifice&quot; by Charles Sims.

===Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour===

The Royal Canadian Legion Hall of Honour is a oval-shaped exhibit which explores how Canadian military history has been commemorated and honoured throughout recorded history. The original plaster model that was submitted and later chosen in the National War Memorial design competition is exhibited in the centre of the Hall of Honour.

Floor-to-ceiling display cases containing certificates of service, letters, medals, models, paintings, photographs, rolls of honour, scrapbooks, and souvenirs are situated along the walls of the exhibit. The exhibits are displayed chronologically and include items relating to First Nations, New France, British North America, and confederated Canada. However, the majority of the displays are dedicated to exhibiting items from the 20th century. Items in these displays, along with the individual stories corresponding to each chronological period are exhibited in an attempt to convey the various forms of commemorating the war dead throughout Canadian history.

==Collection==

As of 2015, the museum&#x27;s collection includes over 500,000 pieces. The collection includes correspondences, documents, equipment, maps, medals, military art, military vehicles, and military uniforms. On average, the museum receives 700 offers for donations a year, including individual items or large collections; although, the museum only accepts 100 to 150 of these offers annually. However, Canadian service medals and medals of valour are accepted by the museum unconditionally, as an &quot;act of honouring&quot;. Approximately 2,000 artworks and photographs from the museum&#x27;s collection are used throughout the museum exhibits; although 500 of these images are enlarged versions of originals.

Items from the museum&#x27;s collection are either displayed in the museum&#x27;s exhibits, on tour with travelling exhibitions, loaned out to other institutions, or housed in the museum storage area. From 1967 to 2004, items not on display were stored in off-site facilities; with the Dominion Archives&#x27; Trophy Building used as storage from 1967 to 1983, and Vimy House used as storage from 1983 to 2004. During the 20th century, archival materials belonging to the war museum were also held in a warehouse in ByWard Market. In 2004, the museum ceased operating these off-site storage facilities, after it relocated items held there to a new storage space within the new museum building.

The museum&#x27;s collection originated from the artifacts and archival materials originally held at Cartier Square Military Museum in 1880; including an assortment of weapons; a bell from , the flagship for Admiral Charles Saunders during the 1759 siege of Quebec; and the colours for the Royal Highland Emigrants, and various units from the War of 1812. The collection grew in size during the First World War, with materials from the war transported back to Canada. Following the end of World War II in Europe, the museum dispatched its first collections acquisition team to the Netherlands and Allied-occupied Germany to acquire a large number of German military equipment. During the Cold War, the museum&#x27;s collection continued to expand with the Canadian Armed Forces transferring its obsolete equipment, as well as examples of enemy equipment to the museum. During the 1990s, the museum also began to acquire a number of materials as gifts from several post-Soviet states.

In 1994, the museum&#x27;s collection held approximately 6,550 posters; with 3,770 posters originating from Canada, 692 from the United Kingdom, 612 from the United States, and the remaining from a variety of countries in Europe, and Australia. In 2019, 39 of the 99 original Victoria Crosses that were awarded to Canadians are held in the collections of the Canadian War Museum.

===War art===

As of 2015, the museum&#x27;s Beaverbrook Collection of War Art contained over 13,000 pieces of military art. The majority of the war artworks in the collection are on paper, although these works are less often used in museum exhibits than their on canvas counterparts. The museum has been invested in several Canadian war art programs since 1971, after the National Gallery of Canada handed over management of the Canadian War Memorial Fund, and over 5,000 works from its Canadian War Records Collections to the war museum; including all of its war art from the Second World War. The museum&#x27;s military art collection takes its name from Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, who established the art collection that later became the Canadian War Records. Although the museum&#x27;s war art collection included over 13,000 works, only 64 of these pieces depicted a dead body as of 2017.

The museum&#x27;s collection of war art includes over 400 works by Alex Colville. Other artists featured in the collection include Caroline Armington, Alfred Bastien, Charles Comfort, Alma Duncan, Colin Gill, Bobs Cogill Haworth, Robert Stewart Hyndman, Richard Jack, Frank Johnston, Manly E. MacDonald, Pegi Nicol MacLeod, Mabel May, Jack Nichols, Charles Sims, and Frederick Varley. The collection also includes several models and statues, including the plaster model by Vernon March that was later selected as the design for the National War Memorial. The museum&#x27;s collection also includes the original scale plaster models by Walter Seymour Allward for the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. From 1937 to 2000, the models were held in storage, before they were exhibited in an exhibition in 2000. The models are now used in the Regeneration Hall exhibition.

Major travelling exhibitions of war art organized by the Canadian War Museum include &quot;A Terrible Beauty: The Art of Canada at War&quot; (1977), curated by the Canadian War Museum and Heather Robertson; and &quot;Canvas of War: Masterpieces from the Canadian War Museum&quot;, which toured Canada between 1999 and 2004 and was seen by nearly half a million visitors.

In 2007, the Canadian War Museum highlighted contemporary women&#x27;s perspectives on war in the exhibitions &quot;War Brides: Portraits of an Era&quot; (an installation by Calgary artist Bev Tosh) and &quot;Stitches in Time&quot; (the work of London, Ontario artist Johnnene Maddison).

====Selected works====
==Library and archives==
The Military History Research Centre is a facility in the museum that houses the Hartland Molson Library Collection, and the George Metcalf Archival Collection. The Hartland Molson Library Collection serves as the museum&#x27;s reference collection on Canadian military history, materials, and rare books; whereas George Metcalf Archival Collection serves as an archive for blueprints, daguerreotypes, films, journals, logbooks, maps, photographs, scrapbooks, and tapes. The research centre includes a general reading area that overlooks the adjacent river, and a specialized reading room for more fragile materials.

Although the War Trophies Review Board initially planned for the museum to include an archive, the museum did little archival work until 1967. The archiving of war-related documents was primarily undertaken by the Public Archives of Canada up until that point; although the Public Archives voluntarily turned over war materials sent to the archives to the war museum. After the closure of the Public Archive&#x27;s history museum in 1967, materials and documents from the museum were split between the National Museum of Man (now the Canadian Museum of History), and the Canadian War Museum. As a result of the closure of the Public Archive&#x27;s history museum, the Public Archives began to regularly transfer archival documents to the war museum. In 1982, the museum&#x27;s archival collection was reorganized into several categories, souvenirs, museum, manuscripts, maps, plans and blueprints, and Canadian War Museum records.

The Military History Research Centre&#x27;s oral history archive contained nearly 400 interviews in 2007. The oral history collection was started by the museum in 1999. The program devised topic lists to guide interviews toward certain areas of interest; although the framing of the topics is designed to allow for in-depth conversation, one free of bias. Interviews were either conducted by the museum&#x27;s research team, or ex-military officers and averaged 90 minutes in length. Subjects of interviews include service members who served in the Second World War, United Nations Emergency Force, Canadian Forces Europe, Yugoslav Wars, and the War in Afghanistan. Specific subjects interviewed include Airborne Intercept Navigators in NATO and NORAD, deputy commanders of NORAD, and all former Canadian commanders of STANAVFORLANT.

In 2000, the museum&#x27;s photographic archives contained over 600 photograph collections or fonds; holding more than 17,000 individual photographs, and more than 250 photo albums. The collection was largely obtained through private sources, most of whom had taken the photo as participants in these conflicts.

<text>The Weissenberg number (Wi) is a dimensionless number used in the study of viscoelastic flows. It is named after Karl Weissenberg. The dimensionless number compares the elastic forces to the viscous forces. It can be variously defined, but it is usually given by the relation of stress relaxation time of the fluid and a specific process time. For instance, in simple steady shear, the Weissenberg number, often abbreviated as Wi or We, is defined as the shear rate formula_1 times the relaxation time formula_2. Using the Maxwell model and the Oldroyd-B model, the elastic forces can be written as the first Normal force (N1).

:formula_3

Since this number is obtained from scaling the evolution of the stress, it contains choices for the shear or elongation rate, and the length-scale. Therefore the exact definition of all non dimensional numbers should be given as well as the number itself.

While Wi is similar to the Deborah number and is often confused with it in technical literature, they have different physical interpretations. The Weissenberg number indicates the degree of anisotropy or orientation generated by the deformation, and is appropriate to describe flows with a constant stretch history, such as simple shear. In contrast, the Deborah number should be used to describe flows with a non-constant stretch history, and physically represents the rate at which elastic energy is stored or released.

<text>Bickley is a district and a local government electoral ward in South East London, within the London Borough of Bromley. It is located 10.4 miles (16.7 km) south east of Charing Cross, bordering Elmstead to the north, Chislehurst to the north-east and east, Petts Wood to the south-east, Southborough to the south, Bromley to the south-west and west and Widmore to the north-west. Until 1965, it was in the historic county of Kent.

==History==
The area&#x27;s name is first recorded in 1279, the &#x27;ley&#x27; or &#x27;lea&#x27; referring to a forest clearing, and &#x27;Bicca&#x27; either meaning a pointed ridge, or else a personal name. The area remained rural, save for a small hunting lodge belonging to the Wells family dating to 1759. The Lodge was gradually enlarged to become Bickley Hall, a classical house designed by Robert Mylne, FRS, for John Wells, shipbuilder, in 1780 (demolished 1963). His brother William, shipbuilder and a director of Greenwich Hospital, inherited the estate, and his son John commissioned additions by Robert Smirke in 1810. John Wells began selling part of his lands in 1841 following due to financial difficulties, and by the late 1850s a few large houses had been built in the area, aided by the opening of Bickley railway station (formerly named Southborough Road) in 1858 and Chislehurst station in 1865. Much of the area was purchased and developed by George Wythes, who commissioned numerous large houses for the wealthy classes, most of them designed by Richard Norman Shaw and Ernest Newton. St George&#x27;s Church was built in 1865, and a cricket ground in 1868. Smaller-scale development continued throughout the early 20th century and several of the older, larger properties were demolished or sub-divided. The area today remains a wealthy one, characterised by large detached housing.

== Parks in Bickley==

===Jubilee Country Park===
With entrances in Thornet Wood Road and Blackbrook lane, there are 62 acres (25 hectares) of wildflower meadows, hedgerows and semi-natural ancient woodland. There is a cycle route through this park to Petts Wood. The London LOOP footpath also goes through Jubilee Park and it is linked to National Trust countryside at Petts Wood and beyond that to Scadbury Park Nature Reserve.

===Whitehall Recreation Ground===
A large play area on Southlands Road with a children&#x27;s playground.

===Widmore Recreation Ground===
A small local park with a children&#x27;s playground which has entrances in Pembroke Road, Lewes Road and Tylney Road.

<doc id="248044" wikidata="Q7870541" url="?curid=248044" title="USS John A. Moore">
<text>USS &quot;John A. Moore&quot; (FFG-19), eleventh ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for Commander John Anderson Moore (1910–1944). Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California on 28 February 1977 as part of the FY77 program, &quot;John A. Moore&quot; was laid down on 19 September 1978, launched on 20 October 1979, and commissioned on 14 November 1981.

&quot;John A. Moore&quot; was the first ship of that name in the US Navy. The namesake was commanding officer of the submarine in 1943 and 1944. Cdr. Moore received three awards of the Navy Cross during his command, the last posthumously after &quot;Grayback&quot; was sunk in February 1944.

== TCG &quot;Gediz&quot; (F 495) ==
Decommissioned and stricken on 1 September 2000, she was transferred to Turkey as that nation&#x27;s TCG &quot;Gediz&quot; (F 495). As of 2015, she is still active in the service of the Turkish Navy. TCG Gediz (F 495) went through major modernisation and was redesignated as a Gabya-class frigate (G-class).
== In other media ==
On the TV show &quot;MacGyver&quot; Season 1, Episode 11, the ship is visible in the opening scene, at the outfitting pier of Todd Pacific shipyard, along with two other FFG 7 ships under construction.

On the TV show JAG the ship was used multiple times. It was used in season 3 episode &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot;, where the ship played the part of a fictional frigate USS &quot;Stockdale&quot; (FFG-62). In the season 5, episode 7 &quot;Rogue&quot; the ship played the fictional frigate USS &quot;Ellyson&quot; (FFG-19).

In the TV show &quot;NCIS&quot; Episode 24 in Season 3 the ship is seen listed on a video monitor as FFG-19 when the Cape Fear Container Ship blows up.

<text>The music of Mexico is highly diverse, featuring a wide range of musical genres and performance styles. It has been influenced by a variety of cultures, primarily deriving from Europeans, Indigenous, and Africans. Music became an expression of Mexican nationalism starting in the nineteenth century.

==History of Mexican music==


The foundation of Mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the teponaztli), flutes, rattles, conches as trumpets and their voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many old world influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the Mexican vihuela used in Mariachi music, were adapted from their old-world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.

There existed regional and local musical traditions in the colonial period and earlier, but national music began to develop in the nineteenth century, often with patriotic themes of national defense and against foreign invaders. Conservative general and president Antonio López de Santa Anna brought a Catalan music master, Jaime Nunó, from nearby Cuba to create a network of military bands on a national scale. He composed the music for the Mexican national anthem. During the French Intervention in Mexico, which placed Maximilian of Habsburg on the throne of the French empire in Mexico, many musicians accompanied his entourage and he established the National Conservatory of Music in 1866.

Liberal President Benito Juárez saw the need to create military bands. Village brass bands proliferated in the late nineteenth century, with concerts in town squares, often on a central kiosk. During the Porfiriato, musical styles expanded, with Mexican national music, cosmopolitan music brought by foreign elites, and European regional music such as polkas, mazurkas, and waltzes, as well as opera overtures. Musicians had access to and used sheet music, indicating musical literacy. In some indigenous regions, new music and bands helped bring a level of unity. In Oaxaca, a waltz, &quot;Dios nunca muere&quot; (God never dies) became the state&#x27;s anthem, linking regional patriotism with God.
A variety of musical styles from elsewhere were incorporated into Mexican popular music in the nineteenth. Music, dance, and poetry flourished in the Porfiriato. Mexico&#x27;s National Conservatory of Music was strongly influenced by Italian masters, who gave way to French influence at the turn of the twentieth century.

Following the Revolution, Venustiano Carranza, leader of the winning Constitutionalist faction of the Revolution, mandated that the National Conservatory &quot;recover the national&quot; in its musical education, abandoning rather than privileging foreign music. Younger Mexican composers emerged, including Carlos Chávez, Silvestre Revueltas, and Luis Sandi, who developed Mexican &quot;art music.&quot; Chávez was a prolific composer and one who embraced creating Mexican orchestral music drawing on revolutionary corridos, and composed an Aztec-themed ballet. He became the director of the National Conservatory of Music, which became affiliated with the Ministry of Education (SEP). Revueltas composed music for the new, emerging Mexican cinema, and Sandi created choral works, creating music for civic events, as well as incorporating indigenous music from the Yaqui and Maya regions in his compositions. Chávez is seen as the driving force behind the split between of Mexican art music and traditional styles, privileging art music. However, traditional or folkloric music continues to be popular, and the Ballet Folklórico de México, established in 1952, performs regularly at Bellas Artes.

==Traditional folk music==
=== Northern Mexican folk music ===

Northern traditional music or &quot;Norteño&quot; was highly influenced by immigrants from Germany, Poland, and Czechia to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the mid 1800s, the instruments and musical styles of the Central European immigrants were adopted to Mexican folk music, the accordion becoming especially popular and is still frequently used. There are many styles of northern mexican folk music, among the most popular being Ranchera, Corrido, Huapango, Chotís, Polka, Redova and Banda. Norteño folk music is some of the most popular music in and out of Mexico, with Corridos and Rancheras being specifically popular in Chile, Colombia, United States, Central America and Spain.

==== Northern Mexican folk music genres ====

* Corrido: Corrido music is a popular narrative song of poetry form, a ballad. Various themes are featured in Mexican corridos, and corrido lyrics are often old legends (stories) and ballads about a famed criminal or hero in the rural frontier areas of Mexico. Some corridos may also be love stories there are also corridos about women (La Venganza de Maria, Laurita Garza, La tragedia de Rosita, and la adelita) and couples, not just about men.
* Ranchera: Ranchera music, whose term derives from ranch (farm for raising livestock, typical of the southern United States and Mexico; in Spanish it&#x27;s called &quot;rancho&quot;), usually has a rhythm in 2/4 (the ranchera corrido or polka), 3/4 (ranchera valsada) or 4/4 (ranchera romantica), with songs typically in a major key. Generally the most appreciated and important exponent of this genre is considered José Alfredo Jiménez.
* Banda: Banda music was made with the imitation of military bands that were imported during the Second Mexican Empire, headed by emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in the 1860s. Polish and German immigrants established themselves in the state of Sinaloa. It was further popularized during the Mexican Revolution when local authorities and states formed their own bands to play in the town squares. Revolutionary leaders like Pancho Villa, also took wind bands with them wherever they went. Banda has to this day remained popular throughout the central and northern states. It has, however, diversified into different styles due to regions, instruments and modernization. Today people associate banda with Sinaloense. Although banda music is played by many bands from different parts of Mexico, its original roots are in Sinaloa, made popular by bands from Sinaloa.

=== Central Mexican folk music ===

The folklore in central Mexico retains strong spanish Influence which can be seen in the amount of colonial cities in this region like Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Zacatecas and also the instruments utilized in the folk music such as guitars, violins and vihuelas. The most iconic figure from central Mexico is the Mexican charro, a kind of horseman originated in Jalisco in the early 1900s. In Central Mexico, The most characteristic style of folk music is Mariachi, a style which is played by a group consisting of five or more musicians who wear charro suits and play various instruments such as the violin, the vihuela, guitar, a guitarrón and a trumpet with lyricism usually being about love, betrayal, death, politics, revolutionary heroes and country life.

==== Central Mexican folk music genres ====
* Mariachi: Mariachi is an ensemble that consists of guitarrón, vihuela, guitar, violins and trumpets. Between 1940 and 1960 mariachi and rancheras originated in the western states of the country. This folk ensemble performs ranchera, son de mariachi, huapango de mariachi, polka, corrido, and other musical forms. It originated in the southern part of the state of Jalisco during the 19th century. The city of Guadalajara in Jalisco is known as the &quot;Capital of Mariachi&quot;. The style is now popular throughout Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and is considered representative of Mexican music and culture.
* Tamborazo Zacatecano: Tamborazo Zacatecano (&quot;drum-beat from Zacatecas&quot;) is a banda style traditionally played by two trumpets, two saxophones, and the al bass drum. Tamborazo is closely related to traditional brass Banda. However, Tamborazo uses saxophones instead of clarinets. Another difference from banda is that Tamborazo uses its drum consistently, as opposed to banda which distributes the use of the other instruments throughout a song. Tamborazo originated in Villanueva in the state of Zacatecas.

=== Southern Mexican folk music ===
The south of Mexico is often characterized by a strong mixture of different cultures since this region has some of the most important port cities of the country like Veracruz and Acapulco which functioned as an entry way for immigrants from Europe, Africa, The Middle East, South America, the Caribbean and Asia. Some of the most known folk music in southern Mexico are Son Jarocho from Veracruz, Chilena from the Costa Chica regions in Guerrero and Oaxaca, Jarana Yucateca from the Yucatan Peninsula, Bolero from Yucatan and Veracruz and Abajeño from Michoacán.

==== Southern Mexican folk music genres ====

*Son Jarocho: Son Jarocho music comes from the Veracruz area, and is distinguished by a strong African influence. International acclaim has been limited, including the major hit &quot;La Bamba&quot;. The most legendary performer is Graciana Silva, whose releases on Discos Corason made inroads in Europe. Southern Veracruz is home to a distinct style of Jarochos that is characteristically lacking a harp, is played exclusively by requinto or jarana guitars, and is exemplified by the popular modern band Mono Blanco.
* Chilena: Chilena is a musical genre from the Costa Chica region, an area along the Pacific Ocean between the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, although its influence extends to other nearby regions. It originated from the Chilean cueca, hence its name, a dance that was carried by Chilean sailors in 1821 and then by Chilean immigrants between 1848 and 1855, during the height of the California gold rush.

==Popular music of folk roots==

===Grupera===
Grupera (or onda grupera) is a genre of Mexican popular music. It is influenced by the styles of cumbia, norteño, and ranchera, and reached the height of its popularity in the 1980s, especially in rural areas.

The music has roots in the rock groups of the 1960s but today generally consists of five or fewer musicians using electric guitars, keyboards and drums. Artists in this genre include Los Yonics, Los Temerarios, Los Bukis, La Mafia, Ana Bárbara, Alicia Villarreal, Mariana Seoane, Grupo Bryndis, Los Freddy&#x27;s, Lidia Ávila, Los Caminantes, Los Humildes, La Migra, Liberación, Pegasso, and Grupo Mojado. The music increased in popularity in the 1990s and became commercially viable, and is now recognized in some Latin music awards ceremonies such as Lo Nuestro and the Latin Grammy Awards.

The original wave of Mexican rock bands got their start mostly with Spanish covers of popular English rock songs. After this initial stage they moved on to include in their repertoire traditional ranchera songs, in addition to cumbia, and ballads. Thus the 1970s saw the rise of a number of grupera bands that specialized in slow ballads and songs that up to that point had only been sung with mariachi. Among these we can include Los Muecas, Los Freddys, Los Babys, etc.

===Cumbia===
==Popular music==

===Pop===
During the 1960s and 1970s most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted of Spanish-language versions of English-language rock-and-roll hits. Singers and musical groups like Angélica María, Johnny Laboriel, Alberto Vázquez, Enrique Guzmán or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by Elvis Presley, Paul Anka, Nancy Sinatra and others.

In 2000, the century saw the crossover of some of Mexican recording artist like Paulina Rubio and Thalía into the English music industry, with bilingual albums, compilation album, that included hit songs in English and Spanish language, and the firsts solo English-language albums by the Mexican pop artist. The best recording crossover artist has been Paulina Rubio with her first English-language album being &quot;Border Girl&quot; released on June 18, 2002. Thalia has collaborated with U.S. singer of traditional pop standards Tony Bennett in a duet for the song &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot;. &quot;Viva Duets&quot; is the studio album by Tony Bennett, released in October 2012. It consists of electronically assembled duets between Bennett and younger singers from various genres like Frank Sinatras &quot;Duets II&quot;. In &quot;Duets II&quot;, Sinatra personally invited Luis Miguel to participate on a duet in the album for the song &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;. Luis Miguel has been dubbed several times by the press and the media as the &quot;Latin Frank Sinatra&quot;.

The best-known Mexican pop singers are José María Napoleón, Juan Gabriel, Lucía Méndez, Ana Gabriel, Daniela Romo, Marco Antonio Solís, Yuri, Gloria Trevi, Lucero, Angélica María, Luis Miguel, Sasha Sokol, Thalía, Paulina Rubio, Alessandra Rosaldo, Reyli, Bibi Gaytán, Edith Márquez, Fey, Aracely Arámbula, Irán Castillo, Lynda Thomas, Natalia Lafourcade, Paty Cantú, Anahí, Maite Perroni, Dulce María, Ximena Sariñana, Yuridia, Daniela Luján, Belinda Peregrín, Sofía Reyes, Kika Edgar, Carlos Rivera, Kalimba (singer), and groups like Camila, Sin Bandera, Ha*Ash, Jesse &amp; Joy, Belanova, Playa Limbo, and Jotdog.

===Rock===
The Mexican rock movement started in the late 1940s and early 1960s, rapidly becoming popular, and peaking in the 1969 and 1990s with real authentic sounds and styles. One of the early Mexican rock bands came out of the predominantly Mexican barrio community of East Los Angeles, &quot;Los Nómadas&quot; (The Nomads). They were the first ethnically integrated rock and roll band of the 1950s, consisting of three Mestizo boys, Chico Vasquez, Jose &#x27;J.D.&#x27; Moreno, Abel Padilla, and a Caucasian boy Bill Aken (Billy Mayorga Aken).

The adopted son of classical guitarist Francisco Mayorga and Mexican movie actress Lupe Mayorga, Aken was mentored by family friend, jazz guitarist Ray Pohlman and would later become rocker Zane Ashton, arranging music and playing lead guitar for everybody from Elvis to Nina Simone. His association with the other three boys would be a lifelong one and they stayed together as a band for more than thirty years. Mexican Rock combined the traditional instruments and stories of Mexico in its songs. Mexican and Latin American rock en español remain very popular in Mexico, surpassing other cultural interpretations of rock and roll, including British rock.
In the 1960s and 1970s, during the PRI government, most rock bands were forced to appear underground, that was the time after Avándaro (a Woodstock-style Mexican festival) in which groups like El Tri, Enigma, Los Dug Dug&#x27;s, Javier Bátiz and many others arose. During that time Mexican Carlos Santana became famous after performing at Woodstock. During the 1980s Nar Mattaru formed in 1995 in Monterrey, N.L., and 1990s many Mexican bands went to the surface and popular rock bands like Santa Sabina, Café Tacuba, Caifanes, Control Machete, Fobia, Los de Abajo, Molotov, Maná, Ely Guerra, Julieta Venegas and Maldita Vecindad achieved a large international following.
The latter are &quot;grandfathers&quot; to the Latin ska movement. Mexico City has also a considerable movement of bands playing surf rock inspired in their outfits by local show-sport lucha libre. In the late 1990s, Mexico had a new wave &quot;resurgence&quot; of rock music with bands like Jumbo, Zoé, Porter, etc., as well as instrumentalists Rodrigo y Gabriela and Los Jaigüey the band of Santa Sabina&#x27;s bass player, Poncho Figueroa, along with brothers Gustavo Jacob and Ricardo Jacob in the late 2000s.

Extreme metal has been popular for a long time in Mexico, with bands such as Dilemma, Exanime formed in 1985 in Monterrey, N.L. The Chasm, Xiuhtecuhtli, Disgorge, Brujeria, Transmetal, Hacavitz, Sargatanas, Mictlayotl, Yaoyotl, Ereshkigal, Xibalba, and Calvarium Funestus. The Mexican metal fanbase is credited with being amongst the most lively and intense, and favorites for European metal bands to perform for.

Alejandra Guzmán&#x27;s 26 years of artistic career, with more than 10 million albums sold, 16 released albums and 30 singles in radio&#x27;s top 10 hits, has earned her the title of La Reina del Rock (The Queen of Rock). She is the daughter of two Latin entertainment legends: movie icon Silvia Pinal and rock and roll legend Enrique Guzmán, from whom she inherits her talent and passion for arts, music, dance and constant spiritual growth, but in the real Mexican vision her as seen like a pop singer, not real rock.

===Latin alternative===
An eclectic range of influences is at the heart of Latin alternative, a music created by young players who have been raised not only on their parents&#x27; music but also on rock, hip-hop and electronica. It represents a sonic shift away from regionalism and points to a new global Latin identity.

The name &quot;Latin alternative&quot; was coined in the late 1990s by American record company executives as a way to sell music that was -literally—all over the map. It was marketed as an alternative to the slick, highly produced Latin pop that dominated commercial Spanish-language radio, such as Ricky Martin or Paulina Rubio.

Artists within the genre, such as Rodrigo y Gabriela, Carla Morrison, Café Tacuba, Hello Seahorse!, Porter, Juan Son, Austin TV, Lila Downs, Maria jose, Paté de Fuá, Julieta Venegas and Jenny and the Mexicats have set out to defy traditional expectations of Latin music.

===Mexican ska===

Ska entered Mexico in the 1960s, when both small bands like Los Matemáticos and big orchestras like Orquestra de Pablo Beltrán Ruíz recorded both original ska tunes and covers of Jamaiacan hits. After early new wave bands of the early 1980s like Ritmo Peligroso and Kenny y los Eléctricos incorporated ska into their post-punk sound, a more punk-influenced brand of Ska started being produced in Mexico City in the late eighties, and the genre enjoyed its highest popularity during the early 2000s, even though it is still very popular today. Mexican Ska groups include Panteón Rococó (Mexico City), Inspector (Nuevo Leon), Control Machete, La Maldita Vecindad (Mexico City), Mama Pulpa (Mexico City) and Tijuana No! (Tijuana, Baja California; originally named Radio Chantaje).

===Electronic===
Some of the best Mexican composers for electronic and electroacoustic media are Javier Torres Maldonado, Murcof and Manuel Rocha Iturbide, the later conducting festivals and workshops of experimental music and art, in Mexico City and Paris. Some exponents are 3Ball MTY, Nortec Collective, Wakal, Kobol (band), Murcof, Hocico &amp; Deorro and Mexican Institute of Sound.

==Other music of Latin-American roots==
Other popular forms of music found in various parts of Mexico – mostly with origins in other parts of the Caribbean and Latin America include rumba, mambo, Cha cha chá, Danzón, Cumbia, and bolero. Rumba came from the black Mexican slaves in Veracruz, Mexico City, and Yucatán. The style began in Cuba and later became famous in the black community of Mexico. From the beginning of the 20th century, bolero arrived to Yucatán, and Danzón to Veracruz. Both styles became very popular all over the country, and a Mexican style of both rhythms was developed.

In the 1940s, the Cubans Pérez Prado, Benny Moré emigrated to Mexico, they brought with them the mambo, which became extremely popular especially in Mexico City, later on mambo developed into Cha cha chá, which was also popular.

===Bolero===
The Cuban bolero has traveled to Mexico and the rest of Latin America after its conception, where it became part of their repertoires. Some of the bolero&#x27;s leading composers have come from nearby countries, most especially the prolific Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hernández; another example is Mexico&#x27;s Agustín Lara. Some Cuban composers of the bolero are listed under Trova. Some successful Mexican bolero composers are María Grever, Gonzalo Curiel Barba, Gabriel Ruiz, and Consuelo Velázquez which song Verdad Amarga (Bitter Truth) was the most popular in Mexico in the year 1948.

Another composer Armando Manzanero widely considered the first Mexican romantic composer of the Post-war era and one of the most successful composers of Latin America has composed more than four hundred songs, fifty of which have given him international fame. His most well-known songs include Voy a apagar la luz (I&#x27;m Going to Turn Off the Lights), Contigo Aprendí (With you I Learnt... ), Adoro (Adore), No sé tú (I don&#x27;t know if you...), Por Debajo de la Mesa (Under the Table) Esta Tarde Vi Llover (English version &quot;Yesterday I Heard the Rain&quot;), Somos Novios (English version &quot;It&#x27;s Impossible&quot;), Felicidad (Happiness) and Nada Personal (Nothing Personal).

Some renowned trios románticos were Trio Los Panchos, Los Tres Ases, Los Tres Diamantes and Los Dandys. Trio Bolero, a unique ensemble of two guitars and one cello. Other singers in singing boleros in Mexico are Óscar Chávez, José Ángel Espinoza and Álvaro Carrillo.

Included among the acclaimed interpreters of the bolero on the radio and the international concert stage were the Mexican tenors Juan Arvizu and Nestor Mesta Chayres. The brother of Aida Cuevas, &quot;the Queen of the Ranchera,&quot; Carlos Cuevas has been equally successful as an interpreter of the bolero and Eugenia León in Mexico&#x27;s contemporary music scene.

===Romantic ballad or Latin ballad===

The Latin or romantic balled has its origin in the Latin American bolero in the 1950s (Lucho Kitten, Leo Marini), but also in the romantic song in Italian (Nicola Di Bari) and French (Charles Aznavour) in the 1960s and 1970s.

The ethnomusicologist Daniel Party defines the romantic ballad as &quot;a love song of slow tempo, played by a solo singer accompanied by an orchestra usually&quot;.
The ballad and bolero are often confused and songs can fall in one or the other category without too much precision. The distinction between them is referring primarily to a more sophisticated and more metaphorical language and subtle bolero, compared with a more direct expression of the ballad.

In Mexico, the first ballad that is registered as such is &quot;Sonata de Amor&quot; (Sonata of Love) of Mario Alvarez in 1961. In 1965, bolero singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero recorded his first ballad, &quot;Pobres besos míos&quot; (My Poor Kisses).

The heyday of the ballad was reached in the mid-1970s, where artists such as José José, Camilo Sesto, Raphael, Roberto Carlos, Rocío Dúrcal and others released many hits. The main hist of José José were &quot;El triste&quot; (The Sad One) by Roberto Cantoral, &quot;La nave del olvido&quot; (The ship of the forgotten), &quot;Te extraño&quot; (I Miss You), &quot;Amar y querer&quot; (Love and want), or &quot;Gavilán o Paloma&quot; (Hawk or Dove), &quot;Lo Pasado Pasado&quot; (The Past is Past), &quot;Volcán&quot; (Volcano) or &quot;Lo que no fue no será&quot; (What Never Was Will Never Be). In the course of their existence the genre merged with diverse rhythms to form several variants, such as romantic salsa and cumbia aside others. Manolo Muñoz was one of the first soloists in Latin America to sing romantic ballads, Víctor Yturbe considered one of the best interpreters of this genre in Mexico and Lupita D&#x27;Alessio is one of the great female singers in the ballad genre of the &#x27;80s in Latin America.

From the 1990s on, globalization and media internationalization contributed to the ballad&#x27;s international spread and homogenization.

==Tropical==
Sonora Santanera is an orchestra playing tropical music from Mexico with over 60 years of history. Los Hermanos Rigual were a Cuban vocal group based in Mexico, mainly active in the sixties. They had their breakout in 1962, thanks to the song &quot;Cuando calienta el sol&quot; which became an international hit.

===Cumbia===
The history of Cumbia in Mexico is almost as old as Cumbia in Colombia. In the 1940s Colombian singers emigrated to Mexico, where they worked with the Mexican orquestra director Rafael de Paz. In the 1950s they recorded what many people consider to be the first cumbia recorded outside of Colombia, &quot;La Cumbia Cienaguera&quot;. He recorded other hits like &quot;Mi gallo tuerto&quot;, &quot;Caprichito&quot;, and &quot;Nochebuena&quot;. This is when Cumbia began to become popular Mexico, with Tony Camargo as one of the first exponents of Mexican Cumbia. In Mexico D.F., most people who dance to it are called &quot;Chilangos&quot;—which means people born in the main district.

In the 1970s Aniceto Molina emigrated to Mexico, where he joined the group from Guerrero, La Luz Roja de San Marcos, and recorded many popular tropical cumbias like &quot;El Gallo Mojado&quot;, &quot;El Peluquero&quot;, and &quot;La Mariscada&quot;. Also in the 1970s, Rigo Tovar became popular with his fusion of Cumbia with ballad and rock.

Today Cumbia is played in many different ways, and has slight variations depending on the geographical area like Cumbia sonidera, Cumbia andina mexicana, Cumbia Norteña, Tecno-cumbia. Popular Mexican Cumbia composers and interpreters include Rigo Tovar y su Costa Azul, Celso Piña, Pilar Montenegro, Ninel Conde, Los Caminantes, and Selena.

Los Ángeles Azules play the &quot;cumbia sonidera&quot; genre, which is a cumbia subgenre using the accordion and synthesizers. This results in a fusion of the sounds of cumbia from the 1950-1970s with those of 1990s-style electronic music.

==Art music==
===Operas===


The first opera by a Mexican-born composer was Manuel de Zumaya&#x27;s &quot;La Parténope&quot;, performed in 1711 before a private audience in the Viceroy&#x27;s Palace in Mexico City. However, the first Mexican composer to have his operas publicly staged was Manuel Arenzana, the &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; at Puebla Cathedral from 1792 to 1821. He is known to have written at least two works performed during the 1805-06 season at the Teatro Coliseo in Mexico City — &quot;El extrangero&quot; and &quot;Los dos ribales en amore&quot;. Both were short comic pieces. The first Mexican &quot;opera seria&quot; was Paniagua&#x27;s &quot;Catalina de Guisa&quot; (composed in 1845 and premiered in 1859). With its story about the Huguenots in France and an Italian libretto by Felice Romani, contemporary critics noted that the only thing Mexican about it was the composer.

Although the traditions of European opera and especially Italian opera had initially dominated the Mexican music conservatory and strongly influenced native opera composers (in both style and subject matter), elements of Mexican nationalism had already appeared by the latter part of the 19th century with operas such as Aniceto Ortega del Villar&#x27;s 1871 &quot;Guatimotzin&quot;, a romanticised account of the defense of Mexico by its last Aztec ruler, Cuauhtémoc. Later works such as Miguel Bernal Jiménez&#x27;s 1941 &quot;Tata Vasco&quot; (based on the life of Vasco de Quiroga, the first bishop of Michoacán) incorporated native melodies into the score. Ángela Peralta was an operatic soprano of international fame, known in Europe as &quot;The Mexican Nightingale&quot;, who sang in the premieres of operas by Paniagua, Morales, and Ortega del Villar. Mexican tenors include Rolando Villazon, Ramón Vargas, Francisco Araiza, Arturo Chacón Cruz, Fernando de la Mora, Javier Camarena, José Mojica, José Sosa Esquivel, and Alfonso Ortiz Tirado. Mexican soprano include Marta Domingo, Maria Katzarava, Irma González, Olivia Gorra, Irasema Terrazas, and singer Susana Zabaleta.

Spanish opera singer, conductor and arts administrator Plácido Domingo (in the 1990s part of The Three Tenors), started his career in Mexico and continued to do charitable work and presentations in Mexico.

===Classical===
Mexico has a long tradition of classical music, as far back as the 16th century, when it was a Spanish colony. Music of New Spain, especially that of Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla and Hernando Franco, is increasingly recognized as a significant contribution to New World culture.
Puebla was a significant center of music composition in the 17th century, as the city had considerable wealth and for a time was presided over by Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, who was an enthusiastic patron of music. Composers during this period included Bernardo de Peralta Escudero (mostly active around 1640), and also Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, who was the most well-known composer of the 17th century in Mexico. The construction of the cathedral in Puebla made the composition and performance of polychoral music possible, especially compositions in the Venetian polychoral style. Late in the century, Miguel Matheo de Dallo y Lana set the verse of poet Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.

In the 18th century, Manuel de Sumaya, &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; at the cathedral in Mexico City, wrote many &quot;cantadas&quot; and &quot;villancicos&quot;, and he was the first Mexican to compose an opera, &quot;La Partenope&quot; (1711). After him, Ignacio Jerusalem, an Italian-born composer, brought some of the latest operatic styles as well as early classical (&quot;galant&quot;) styles to Mexico. His best-known composition is probably the &quot;Matins for the Virgin of Guadalupe&quot; (1764). Jerusalem was &quot;maestro de capilla&quot; at the cathedral in Mexico City after Sumaya, from 1749 until his death in 1769.

In the 19th century the waltzes of Juventino Rosas achieved world recognition. Manuel M. Ponce is recognized as an important composer for the Spanish classical guitar, responsible for widening the repertoire for this instrument. Ponce also wrote a rich repertoire for solo piano, piano and ensembles, and piano and orchestra, developing the first period of modernistic nationalism, using Native American and European resources, but merging them into a new, original style.
In the 20th century, Carlos Chávez is a notable composer who wrote symphonies, ballets, and a wide catalog of chamber music, within varied esthetic orientations. Chávez&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonía India&quot; (&quot;Indian Symphony&quot;) uses three themes based on indigenous songs from northern Mexico. Another recognized composer is Silvestre Revueltas who wrote such pieces as &quot;The Night of the Mayas&quot;, an homage to García Lorca (tribute to García Lorca), Sensemayá based on a poem by Nicolás Guillén, and orchestral suites like Janitzio and Redes originally written for motion pictures. José Pablo Moncayo with compositions such as &quot;Huapango&quot;, and Blas Galindo with &quot;Sones de Mariachi&quot;, are also recognized as adapters of Mexican sons into symphonic music. A later contributor to this tradition, Arturo Márquez is also internationally known by his orchestral mastery and melodic vivacity like Danzón No. 2.
In 1922, Julián Carrillo (violinist, composer, conductor, theoretician and inventor), created a microtonal system that he called &quot;Sonido 13&quot;. He also developed and constructed harps and pianos able to play music in fragments of tone, like fourths, sixths, eighths and sixteenths. 
Another contemporary Mexican composer was Conlon Nancarrow (of U.S. birth), who created a system to play pianola music, using and developing theories of politempo and polimetrics. 
Composers leading Mexican music during the second half of the 20th century include Alicia Urreta, Manuel Enríquez, Mario Lavista, and Julio Estrada. Composers of the next generation include Gabriela Ortiz, Graciela Agudelo, Daniel Catán, Carlos Sanchez-Gutierrez, Guillermo Galindo, Ignacio Baca-Lobera, Hebert Vázquez, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Javier Álvarez, Ana Lara, Víctor Rasgado, Juan Trigos, Hilda Paredes, and Javier Torres Maldonado. Stablished composers of a new generation born in the 70&#x27;s include Georgina Derbez, Gabriel Pareyón, Enrico Chapela, Víctor Ibarra, Arturo Fuentes, and José Luis Hurtado. 

===Jazz===
Some notable Mexican jazz musicians include Magos Herrera, Tino Contreras, and Agustín Bernal. Other prominent figures in the Mexican jazz scene include Juan García Esquivel, Eugenio Toussaint, Arturo Castro, Rafael Méndez, Richard Lemus, Leo Acosta, Luis Ocadiz, J. J. Calatayud, Chilo Morán, and Popo Sánchez. Antonio Sánchez, a highly regarded jazz drummer and composer from Mexico City, has been performing with renowned U.S. musicians since he moved to the United States in the early 1990s. He has collaborated with artists such as Pat Metheny, Chick Corea, Michael Brecker, and Gary Burton, in addition to leading his own bands and ensembles.

Arturo O&#x27;Farrill, the son of Latin jazz musician, arranger, and bandleader Chico O&#x27;Farrill, is known for his contributions to contemporary Latin jazz. His music is often described as &quot;pan-Latin&quot; in style by critic Dan Bilawsky. The Teatro Metropólitan sponsors Mexico City&#x27;s National Jazz Festival. Another group exploring Latin jazz is the Villalobos Brothers.

<doc id="248049" wikidata="Q1423842" url="?curid=248049" title="Allen B. DuMont">
<text>Allen Balcom DuMont, also spelled Du Mont, (January 29, 1901 – November 14, 1965) was an American electronics engineer, scientist and inventor who improved the cathode-ray tube in 1931 for use in television receivers. Seven years later he manufactured and sold the first commercially practical television set to the public. In June 1938, his Model 180 television receiver was the first all-electronic television set sold to the public, a few months prior to RCA&#x27;s first TV set in April 1939. In 1946, DuMont founded the first television network to be licensed, the DuMont Television Network, by linking station WABD (named for DuMont, later becoming WNEW and then WNYW) in New York City to station W3XWT, which later became WTTG, in Washington, D.C. WTTG was named for Dr. Thomas T. Goldsmith, DuMont&#x27;s Vice President of Research, and his best friend. DuMont&#x27;s successes in television picture tubes, TV sets and components and his involvement in commercial TV broadcasting made him the first millionaire in the business.

==Biography==

===Early life===
DuMont was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Lillian Felton (Balcom) and William Henry Beaman DuMont. At the age of 10, he was stricken with polio and was quarantined at his family&#x27;s Eastern Parkway apartment for nearly a year. During his quarantine, his father brought home books and magazines for the young DuMont to read while bedridden. DuMont developed an interest in science, wireless radio communication, and taught himself Morse code.

His father bought him a crystal radio receiver which he assembled, took apart, reassembled and rebuilt several times. He improved his set each time he rebuilt it and later built a transmitter, while his father obtained the landlord&#x27;s permission to erect a transceiving antenna on the roof.

While recuperating from polio, DuMont was advised to swim to regain the use of his legs. In 1914, the family moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where there was an indoor year-round pool available at the local YMCA. He graduated from Montclair High School in 1919, and went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he was part of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; of the Theta Xi fraternity.

===Radio and early interest in television===
In 1915, DuMont became the youngest American to obtain a first class commercial radio operator&#x27;s license at age 14. The following summer, he worked as a radio operator aboard a coastal steamer making runs from New York to Providence, Rhode Island. As the summers went by, he made his way to the Caribbean, South America and, after World War I, to Europe, where, during the summer of 1922, he was stuck in Copenhagen for months because of a dock workers&#x27; strike.

After graduating from Rensselaer in 1924, DuMont worked at the Westinghouse Lamp Company in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in charge of radio tube production. There he increased production from 500 tubes per day to an astounding 50,000 tubes per day. Management gave him a $500 bonus, a small raise, and devised the &quot;Westinghouse Award&quot; to recognize his accomplishments. The Westinghouse Award was later presented as a scholarship award to high school seniors showing promise in a field of science (later the Intel Science Talent Search) and continues to this day as the Regeneron Science Talent Search.

By 1928, DuMont was searching for new opportunities and was wooed by Dr. Lee de Forest, a radio pioneer who developed the audion tube, the original voice amplifier for radio reception. De Forest had had a checkered career as an inventor and several failed business ventures. DuMont was hired by the de Forest Radio Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company as vice president and production manager for radio tubes. He revamped the factory with newly designed machinery: &quot;a high speed sealing machine, automatic grid winding and welding machine, base branding machine, basing and wire cutting machine, high-frequency bombarder and numerous tube-characteristic test sets and life racks.&quot; Factory capacity was increased to 30,000 tubes per day.

When De Forest took over the mechanical television system of C. Francis Jenkins, DuMont turned his attention to television. He was involved in the first television transmissions from W2XCD in Passaic. But DuMont realized that clear images would need the development of scanning in a cathode-ray tube. DuMont worked to improve television transmission and reception and implored De Forest for funds to build a long-lasting cathode-ray tube for television reception. De Forest denied DuMont&#x27;s request because De Forest&#x27;s investors were demanding better returns. DuMont subsequently resigned at the same time that De Forest sold his radio manufacturing business to David Sarnoff at RCA.

===Cathode-ray tube and oscillograph===

DuMont had developed an improved version of the cathode-ray tube which was both cheaper to produce and longer-lasting than the typical German tubes in use– the imported tubes had a life of 25 to 30 hours. DuMont&#x27;s invention of the first long-lasting cathode-ray tube made television commercially viable. He started his own company, Allen B. DuMont Laboratories, in the basement of his Upper Montclair, NJ home, building long-lasting cathode-ray tubes. In 1931, he sold two tubes to two college science laboratories for $35 each.

Since DuMont was a leader in cathode-ray tube (CRT) design and manufacturing, it was a natural step to use the CRT as a visual measuring instrument or oscilloscope. The production of CRT&#x27;s and oscilloscopes was part of DuMont Laboratories in Upper Montclair. Needing more space he moved to a larger location in Passaic, NJ in 1934. Although not the inventor of the oscilloscope, DuMont designed and mass-produced practical oscilloscopes (which he called oscillographs) for all types of laboratory, automotive/equipment servicing and manufacturing applications. By the 1940s DuMont was the leader in the oscilloscope equipment market. DuMont was one of the earliest designers of the triggered sweep oscilloscope using a gas thyratron vacuum tube (forerunner to the silicon controlled rectifier or SCR). This allowed the oscilloscope to display a visual trace at a preset input signal level. In addition the sweep (trace across the CRT screen) could be regulated by the sweep speed or sweep frequency. This design allowed the oscilloscope to provide better visual detail of the signal being studied. The trigger was a frequency synchronizing type which provided viewing stability.

The profits from the oscillographs helped DuMont invest in television design and his DuMont TV Network. Unfortunately the time spent on his TV ventures cannibalized his profitable oscillograph business. In 1947, a young equipment manufacturer called Tektronix produced the model 511 Time Base Trigger and Sweep Oscilloscope for $795. The use of time instead of frequency to measure a sweep across the CRT was Tektronix&#x27;s big selling point. Time measurements make it easier to interpret pulses and complex waveforms. It has been mentioned informally that Allen DuMont saw the model 511 demonstrated at an electronics show. He tried it and was impressed, but commented to Howard Vollum and Jack Murdock, co-founders of Tektronix that it was too expensive and they would be lucky to sell any. Tektronix&#x27;s time base trigger and time sweep generator design would become the standard in the 1950s and into the 21st century. Tektronix would replace DuMont Oscillographs as the leading selling oscilloscope brand.

When Fairchild Camera and Instrument acquired DuMont Laboratories in 1960, oscilloscopes were still being made with the DuMont name brand. Allen DuMont became Group General Manager of the DuMont Division, until his death in 1965. All DuMont oscilloscopes in the late 1950s and after the Fairchild acquisition were using the time base trigger and time sweep generator method introduced by Tektronix. The DuMont line of oscilloscopes continued to be produced into the 1980s.

During the early years of World War II, DuMont received special government contracts to provide large wide cathode-ray tubes. These tubes allowed scientists working on the Manhattan Project to study the action of accelerated electrons.

=== Other achievements ===
In 1932, DuMont proposed a &quot;ship finder&quot; device to the United States Army Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, that used radio wave distortions to locate objects on a cathode-ray tube screen, a type of radar. The military asked him, however, not to take out a patent because they wanted to maintain secrecy, so he is seldom mentioned among those responsible for radar.
In 1932, DuMont invented the magic eye tube, or Electron Ray Tube, used as a tuning accessory in radios and as a level meter in mono and stereo home reel-to-reel tape recorders. In the 1930s the manufacture of mechanical panel meters were labor-intensive and expensive. Magic eye tubes provided radio designers with a less expensive and more profitable way to add a feature usually found in higher priced equipment. The general public reception was a success as customers liked the green glow and the seemingly magical way it worked. He released details on his invention the following year. He sold the patent rights to RCA for $20,000 to help fund his other projects.

DuMont produced black and white televisions in the late 1930s, 1940s and 1950s that were generally regarded as offering highest quality and durability. Many of these premium sets included a built in AM/FM radio and record player.

DuMont sold his television manufacturing division to Emerson Radio in 1958, and sold the remainder of the company to Fairchild Camera in 1960. Fairchild later developed semiconductor microchips. Robert Noyce, a co-founder of Intel, originally worked for DuMont as an engineer.

==DuMont Television Network==

The DuMont Television Network was not an unqualified success, being faced with the major problem of how to make a profit without the benefit of an already established radio network as a base. After ten years, DuMont shuttered the network and sold what remained of his television operations to John Kluge in 1956, which Kluge renamed Metromedia. DuMont&#x27;s partner, Thomas T. Goldsmith (for whom the Washington, D.C. station WTTG was named), remained on Metromedia&#x27;s board of directors from this time all the way until Kluge sold the stations to the Fox Television Stations Group in 1986, when the Fox network was formed.

==Awards, family and later life==
DuMont was the first to provide funding for educational television broadcasting. He was the recipient of numerous honorary degrees and awards, among them the Cross of Knight awarded by the French Government, the Horatio Alger Award, the Westinghouse Award, and the DeForest Medal. He is also a holder of over 30 patents in cathode-ray tubes and other television equipment.

DuMont enjoyed sailing. He owned a cruiser, the &quot;Hurricane III&quot;. He would participate in boat races and compete in navigation skills competition, winning three national championships. He died in 1965 and is buried in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Montclair, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife Ethel and their two children, Allen Jr. and Yvonne. The television center at Montclair State University bears his name and produces programs for the NJTV system (formerly New Jersey Network).

<text>USS &quot;Antrim&quot; (FFG-20) was the twelfth ship of the of guided-missile frigates. She was named for Rear Admiral Richard Nott Antrim (1907–1969).

==Construction==
Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Seattle, Washington, on 28 February 1977, as part of the FY77 program, &quot;Antrim&quot; was laid down on 21 June 1978, launched on 27 March 1979, and commissioned on 26 September 1981.

==Service history==
On 1 October, &quot;Antrim&quot; departed Seattle, en route to Mayport, Florida, her home port. She made stops at Mazatlan and Manzanillo, before arriving in the Canal Zone on 25 October. The guided-missile frigate transited the Panama Canal, on Navy Day, 27 October 1981, and continued on to Mayport, where she arrived on 2 November. &quot;Antrim&quot; conducted independent ship&#x27;s exercises out of Mayport, on an intermittent daily basis until 20 November, when she set sail for Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She carried out shakedown training in the West Indies until 12 December. After a port visit to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, she tested and calibrated her sound equipment in the Bahamas, before returning to Mayport, on 20 December, to commence holiday stand down.

The holiday leave and upkeep period ended on 11 January 1982, with her return to sea to conduct combat systems qualifications and trials. With that event, the guided-missile frigate resumed a normal schedule of operations out of Mayport, in the local operating area, and in the West Indies, as well. On 26 April, &quot;Antrim&quot; departed Mayport, bound ultimately for Bath, Maine, and post-shakedown availability at the Bath Iron Works. Along the way, she stopped at Yorktown, Virginia, to unload ordnance, and at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for a port visit. The warship arrived in Bath, on 7 May and commenced a repair period that lasted 16 weeks. She embarked upon the voyage back to Mayport, on 27 August, made a series of stops en route, and entered Mayport, on 11 September. &quot;Antrim&quot; stayed in port for almost a month, putting to sea again on 8 October, to carry out post-repair refresher training in the vicinity of Guantanamo Bay. The guided-missile frigate completed that mission at the beginning of November, made a brief call at Key West, Florida, and then executed advanced ASW drills in the Bahamas. She reentered Mayport, on 12 November, and remained there through the end of the year.

&quot;Antrim&quot; ended holiday stand down early in January 1983, returning to sea to begin training on 4 January. At the beginning of February, she sailed north to Norfolk, Virginia, where she conducted weapons testing and training. On 10 February, while she was engaged in those evolutions, a target drone skipped off the surface and struck &quot;Antrim&quot; causing a fire in the wardroom and in her electronics spaces. The accident killed a civilian instructor embarked in the warship. &quot;Antrim&quot; returned to Mayport, and passed the rest of February, engaged in repairs. The warship completed her weapons training and testing during March, and spent most of April, preparing to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea and the Middle East. On 29 April, the guided-missile frigate stood out of Mayport. on her way to the Strait of Gibraltar.

She entered the Mediterranean, on 9 May, and joined the 6th Fleet. &quot;Antrim&quot; carried out normal 6th Fleet training operations until the second week in June. On 11 June, the warship transited the legendary Bosporus Straits and the Dardanelles and entered the Black Sea. For eight days, she conducted operations in the Black Sea, and during that time, also paid a four-day visit to Constanta, Romania. &quot;Antrim&quot; left the Black Sea, on 19 June, and resumed her operational schedule as a unit of the 6th Fleet. On 1 August, the guided-missile frigate passed through the Suez Canal and set a course for the Persian Gulf. Following a brief stop at Djibouti, on 3 August, she began duty as a radar picket ship on 4 August. Except for a port call at Karachi, Pakistan, from 27 September to 4 October, &quot;Antrim&quot;, served in the Persian Gulf for almost three months. She carried out turnover formalities with her relief at Djibouti, on 30 October, transited the Suez Canal, on 4 November, and laid in a course for Rota, Spain. After stopping at Rota, briefly on 10 November, &quot;Antrim&quot; set out across the Atlantic. She arrived in Mayport, on 21 November, and stood down for the last weeks of the year.

The relative inactivity of the final month of 1983 carried over into and through the first month of 1984. &quot;Antrim&quot; did not put to sea again until the first week in February. On 3 February, the warship got underway for the coast of Central America. After a call at Puerto Cortés, Honduras, on 6 and 7 February, she transited the Panama Canal, on 10 February. For almost seven weeks, &quot;Antrim&quot; conducted operations off the western shores of Central America from the base at Rodman, in the Canal Zone. On 28 March, she travelled back through the canal and set her course for Mayport. The guided-missile frigate stood into her home port on 2 April. She passed the bulk of the month engaged in repairs, completing post-repair sea trials on 26 and 27 April. On 28 April, &quot;Antrim&quot; headed north for port visits at Newport, Rhode Island, and Portsmouth, followed by plane guard duty for .

The warship returned to Mayport, on 11 May, and resumed local operations 10 days later. At the end of June, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she carried out refresher training until the end of July. After visiting Charleston, South Carolina, at the end of the first week in August, &quot;Antrim&quot; arrived back in Mayport, on 11 August. On 20 August, the guided-missile frigate began a two-month restricted availability at Mayport. She wrapped up the repair period with sea trials on 22 and 23 October, and a stop at Charleston, on 24 October, to load ordnance material. Back in Mayport, on 26 October, &quot;Antrim&quot; executed training missions in the local operating area until early in December, when she began preparations for overseas movement.

Holiday routine interrupted those preparations, late in December, but the pace quickened in January 1985, as her February departure date drew near. On 4 February, &quot;Antrim&quot; stood out of Mayport, on her way across the Atlantic. She made a short call at Rota, for fuel on St. Valentine&#x27;s Day before passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, and into the Mediterranean Sea. The warship transited of the Mediterranean, stopping only at Palma de Mallorca and Augusta Bay, Sicily, before negotiating the Suez Canal, on 27 February. Steaming then through the Red Sea and around the Arabian Peninsula, &quot;Antrim&quot; passed through the Strait of Hormuz on 9 March, and entered the Persian Gulf. While cruising on radar picket station in the Persian Gulf, &quot;Antrim&quot; received a distress call from the Liberian-flag motor vessel, , that had suffered an Iranian missile attack to her bridge. The guided-missile frigate and her embarked helicopter detachment, HSL-36, Del. 1, rendered assistance to the stricken vessel. &quot;Antrim&quot;, then continued her surveillance patrols of the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf, until the end of the third week in April.

At that time, she departed the gulf for a little more than a week to make a port call at Karachi, Pakistan. Back on station in the Persian Gulf, at the end of April, &quot;Antrim&quot; responded to another call for help on 2 May, after the Iranians attacked another motor vessel, , with missiles. Again, the warship and her helicopter detachment evacuated casualties. Her remaining two months of surveillance patrols in the Persian Gulf provided no further untoward incidents. She turned her responsibilities over to and , on 5 July, and set a course via Djibouti, and the Red Sea, to the Suez Canal. Through the canal on 14 July, she made a single stop, at Valencia, Spain, on her voyage across the Mediterranean.

After a short pause at Rota, on 24 July, for fuel, the warship embarked upon the Atlantic passage that same day. On 5 August, one month to the day after her relief, &quot;Antrim&quot; pulled into Mayport. Post-deployment stand down occupied the remainder of August, but she resumed local operations out of Mayport, early in September. During the latter half of November, the warship voyaged to the coast of Colombia, to assist in a multinational operation against drug smugglers. She returned to Mayport, at the beginning of December, and following a short period of local operations, settled into holiday routine. As of the beginning of 1987, &quot;Antrim&quot; was at Mayport.

On 30 January 1987, &quot;Antrim&quot; was assigned to the Naval Reserve Force, Atlantic, at Mayport.

Decommissioned on 8 May 1996, she was transferred to Turkey, on 27 August 1997. She was stricken from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register on 4 September 1997.

== TCG &quot;Giresun&quot; (F 491) ==

The ship serves in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Giresun&quot; (F 491).

On 16 March 2009, &quot;Giresun&quot;, along with , successfully prevented a pirate attack on the Vietnamese cargo ship from succeeding in capturing the target ship.

On 6 March 2011, she aided the destroyer in the capture of four pirates who had attacked the oil tanker . Three of the pirates were later flown to Tokyo for trial.

<doc id="248052" wikidata="Q2305651" url="?curid=248052" title="Battle of Edington">
<text>The Battle of Edington was a battle between an army of the kingdom of Wessex under Alfred the Great and the Great Heathen Army led by Guthrum sometime between 6 and 12 May 878, which Alfred&#x27;s army won the battle. It resulted in the Treaty of Wedmore later that same year. Primary sources locate the battle at &quot;Eðandun&quot;. Until a scholarly consensus linked the battle site with the present-day village of Edington in Wiltshire, it was known as the Battle of Ethandun which still continues to be used.

==Background==

The first Viking raid on Anglo-Saxon England is thought to have occurred between 786 and 802 at Portland in the Kingdom of Wessex, when three Norse ships arrived; their men killed King Beorhtric&#x27;s reeve. At the other end of the country, in the Kingdom of Northumbria, the island of Lindisfarne was raided in 793.
After the sacking of Lindisfarne, Viking raids around the coasts were somewhat sporadic until the 830s, when the attacks became more sustained. In 835, &quot;heathen men&quot; ravaged Sheppey. In 836, Ecgberht of Wessex met in battle a force of 35 ships at Carhampton, and in 838 he faced a combined force of Vikings and Cornishmen at Hingston Down in Cornwall.

The raiding continued and with each year became more intense. In 865–866 it escalated further with the arrival of what the Saxons called the Great Heathen Army. The annals do not report the size of the army, but modern estimates suggest between five hundred and a thousand men. It was said to have been under the leadership of the brothers Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, and Halfdan Ragnarsson. What made this army different from those before it was the intent of the leaders. These forces began &quot;a new stage, that of conquest and residence&quot;. By 870, the Northmen had conquered the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia, and in 871 they attacked Wessex. Of the nine battles mentioned by the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; during that year, only one was a West Saxon victory. In this year, Alfred succeeded his brother Ethelred, who died after the Battle of Merton.

Mercia had collapsed by 874, and the army&#x27;s cohesion went with it. Halfdan went back to Northumbria and fought the Picts and the Strathclyde Welsh to secure his northern kingdom. His army settled there, and he is not mentioned after 876, when &quot;[the Danes] were engaged in ploughing and making a living for themselves&quot;. Guthrum, with two other unnamed kings, &quot;departed for Cambridge in East Anglia&quot;. He made several attacks on Wessex, starting in 875, and in the last nearly captured Alfred in his winter fortress at Chippenham.

By 878, the Danes held the east and northeast of England; their defeat at the Battle of Ashdown had paused but not halted their advance. Alfred the Great had spent the winter preceding the Battle of Edington in the Somerset marsh of Athelney, protected somewhat by the natural defences of the country. In the spring of 878, he summoned his West Saxon forces and marched to Edington, where he met the Danes, led by Guthrum, in battle.

==Alfred&#x27;s position before the battle==
Guthrum and his men had adopted the usual Danish strategy of occupying a fortified town and waiting for a peace treaty, involving money in return for a promise to leave the kingdom immediately. Alfred shadowed the army, trying to prevent more damage than had already occurred. This started in 875 when Guthrum&#x27;s army &quot;eluded the West Saxon levies and got into Wareham&quot;. They then gave hostages and oaths to leave the country to Alfred, who paid them off. The Danes promptly slipped off to Exeter, even deeper into Alfred&#x27;s kingdom, where they concluded in the autumn of 877 a &quot;firm peace&quot; with Alfred, under terms that entailed their leaving his kingdom and not returning. This they did, spending the rest of 877 (by the Gregorian calendar) in Gloucester (in the kingdom of Mercia). Alfred spent Christmas at Chippenham (in Wessex), from Gloucester. The Danes attacked Chippenham &quot;in midwinter after Twelfth Night&quot;, probably during the night of 6–7 January 878. They captured Chippenham and forced Alfred to retreat &quot;with a small force&quot; into the wilderness. (It is to this period that the story of Alfred burning the cakes belongs.)

Alfred seems at this time to have ineffectually chased the Danes around Wessex, while the Danes were in a position to do as they pleased. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; attempts to convey the impression that Alfred held the initiative; it is &quot;a bland chronicle which laconically charts the movements of the Danish victors while at the same time disingenuously striving to convey the impression that Alfred was in control&quot;, although it fails. Even if Alfred had caught up with the Danish force, it is unlikely that he could have accomplished anything. The fact that his army could not defend the fortified Chippenham, even in &quot;an age... as yet untrained in siege warfare&quot; casts great doubt on its ability to defeat the Danes in an open field, unaided by fortifications. There was little that Alfred could do about the Danish menace between 875 and the end of 877, beyond repeatedly paying the invaders off.

==Battle==

With his small warband, a fraction of his army at Chippenham, Alfred could not hope to retake the town from the Danes, who had in previous battles (for example at Reading in 871) proved themselves adept at defending fortified positions. After the disaster at Chippenham, Alfred is next recorded around Easter 878, when he built a fortress at Athelney. In the seventh week after Easter, or between 4 and 7 May, Alfred called a levy at &quot;Ecgbryhtesstan&quot; (Egbert&#x27;s Stone). Many of the men in the counties around (Somerset, Wiltshire, and Hampshire) who had not already fled rallied to him there. The next day, Alfred&#x27;s host moved to Iley Oak, and then the day after that to &quot;Eðandun&quot;. There, on an unknown date between 6 and 12 May, they fought the Danes. According to the &quot;Life&quot;:

After the victory, when the Danes had taken refuge in the fortress, the West Saxons removed all food that the Danes might be able to capture in a sortie, and waited. After two weeks, the starving Danes sued for peace, giving Alfred &quot;preliminary hostages and solemn oaths that they would leave his kingdom immediately&quot;, just as usual, but in addition promising that Guthrum would be baptized. The primary difference between this agreement and the treaties at Wareham and Exeter was that Alfred had decisively defeated the Danes at Edington, rather than just stopping them, and therefore it seemed more likely that they would keep to the terms of the treaty.

One reason for Alfred&#x27;s victory was possibly the relative size of the two armies. The men of even one shire could be a formidable fighting force, as those of Devon proved in the same year, defeating an army under Ubba at the Battle of Cynwit. In addition, in 875 Guthrum had lost the support of other Danish lords, including Ivar the Boneless and Ubba. Further Danish forces had settled on the land before Guthrum attacked Wessex: in East Anglia, and in Mercia between the treaty at Exeter and the attack on Chippenham; many others were lost in a storm off Swanage in 876–877, with 120 ships wrecked. Internal disunity was threatening to tear the Danes apart, and they needed time to reorganize. Fortunately for Wessex, they did not use the time available effectively.
==Location of the battle==

The primary sources for the location of the battle are Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;, which names the place as &quot;Ethandun&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which has &quot;Eðandun&quot;. The chronicle was compiled during the reign of Alfred the Great and is thus a contemporary record. It is believed that Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; was originally written in 893; however, no contemporary manuscript survives. A version of the &quot;Life&quot;, written in about 1000 and known as the &quot;Cotton Otho A. xii&quot; text, lasted until 1731, when it was destroyed in the fire at Ashburnham House. Before its destruction, this version had been transcribed and annotated; it is this transcription on which modern translations are based. Some scholars have suggested that Asser&#x27;s life of King Alfred was a forgery.

The location of the battle accepted by most present-day historians is at Edington, near Westbury in Wiltshire. However, the location has been much debated over the centuries. In 1904 William Henry Stevenson analysed possible sites and said &quot;So far, there is nothing to prove the identity of this &quot;Eðandun&quot; [as named in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle] with Edington&quot; but then goes on to say that &quot;there can be little reason for questioning it&quot;.

The reasoning to support the &quot;Eðandun&quot; of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the &quot;Ethandun&quot; of Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; being Edington in Wiltshire is derived from a trail of information from ancient manuscripts. Edington, Wiltshire, is known to have been part of Alfred&#x27;s family estate. He left a manor called &quot;Eðandun&quot; to his wife in his will. A charter records a meeting of the king&#x27;s council at &quot;Eðandun&quot;, although a later scribe has annotated the same document with &quot;Eðandune&quot;. In 968, another charter reported that King Edgar had granted land at &quot;Edyndon&quot; to Romsey Abbey. The Domesday Book of 1086 has an entry for Romsey Abbey holding land at &quot;Edendone&quot; in the county of Wiltshire at the time of Edward the Confessor (before 1066) and also in 1086, and this is known to be at Edington, Wiltshire.
Alternatives to Edington, Wiltshire, have been suggested since early times. The Tudor historian Polydore Vergil appears to have misread the ancient texts for the battle site, as he places it at &quot;Abyndoniam&quot; (Abingdon) instead of Edington. In the 19th century there was a resurgence in interest of medieval history and King Alfred was seen as a major hero. Although most early historians had sited the battle as in the Edington area, the significant interest in the subject encouraged many antiquarians to dig up Alfredian sites and also to propose alternatives for the location of the battle. Arguments for the alternative sites were generally name-based, although with the large interest in everything Alfredian in the 19th century, any site that had an Alfredian connection could be guaranteed large numbers of tourists, so this was also a driving force to find a link.

==Consequences==
Three weeks after the battle, Guthrum was baptised at Aller in Somerset with Alfred as his sponsor. It is possible that the enforced conversion was an attempt by Alfred to lock Guthrum into a Christian code of ethics, hoping it would ensure the Danes&#x27; compliance with any treaties agreed to. The converted Guthrum took the baptismal name of Athelstan.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Wedmore, the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester (in the kingdom of Mercia) and remained there for a year. The following year the army went to East Anglia, where it settled.

Also in 879, according to Asser, another Viking army sailed up the River Thames and wintered at Fulham in Middlesex. Over the next few years this particular Danish faction had several encounters with Alfred&#x27;s forces. However, Alfred managed to contain this threat by reforming his military and setting up a system of fortified cities, known as burhs.

In 885 Asser reports that the Viking army that had settled in East Anglia had broken &quot;in a most insolent manner&quot; the peace they had established with Alfred, although Guthrum is not mentioned. Guthrum reigned as king in East Anglia until his death in 890, and although this period was not always peaceful he was not considered a threat.
Sometime after Wedmore and before Guthrum&#x27;s death, a treaty was agreed that set out the lasting peace terms between the two kings. It is known as the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum and defines the boundaries of their two kingdoms. The kingdom of Mercia was divided up, with part going to Alfred&#x27;s Wessex and the other part to Guthrum&#x27;s East Anglia. The agreement also defined the social classes of Danish East Anglia and their equivalents in Wessex. It tried to provide a framework that would minimise conflict and regulate commerce between the two peoples. It is not clear how seriously Guthrum took his conversion to Christianity, but he was the first of the Danish rulers of the English kingdoms to mint coins on the Alfredian model, under his baptismal name of Athelstan. By the end of the 9th century, all of the Anglo-Danish rulers were minting coins too. By the 10th century, the Anglo-Saxon model of kingship seems to have been universally adopted by the Anglo-Danish leadership.

After the defeat of Guthrum at the Battle of Edington, Alfred&#x27;s reforms to military obligations in Wessex made it increasingly difficult for the Vikings to raid successfully. By 896 the Vikings had given up, with some going to East Anglia and others to Northumbria. It was under Alfred that the Viking threat was contained. However, the system of military reforms and the Burghal Hidage introduced by Edward the Elder enabled Alfred&#x27;s successors to retake control of the lands occupied in the North of England by the Danes.

<text>USS &quot;Flatley&quot; (FFG-21) was the thirteenth ship of the of guided-missile frigates. She was the first ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Vice Admiral James H. Flatley (1906–1958), a leading Naval Aviation tactician from World War II who flew the Grumman F4F Wildcat in the Battle of Coral Sea and subsequently commanded the VF-10 Grim Reapers taking them into combat for the first time.

Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 28 February 1977 as part of the FY77 program, &quot;Flatley&quot;″s keel was laid down on 13 November 1979. She was launched on 15 May 1980, and commissioned on 20 June 1981. Decommissioned on 11 May 1996, she was sold to Turkey on 27 August 1998.

== TCG &quot;Gemlik&quot; (F 492) ==
The ship immediately underwent conversion into a Turkish . She serves in the Turkish Navy as TCG &quot;Gemlik&quot; (F 492).

<doc id="248054" wikidata="Q2003749" url="?curid=248054" title="Oar">
<text>An oar is an implement used for water-borne propulsion. Oars have a flat blade at one end. Rowers grasp the oar at the other end.

The difference between oars and paddles is that oars are used exclusively for rowing. In rowing the oar is connected to the vessel by means of a pivot point for the oar, either an oarlock, or a thole. The oar is placed in the pivot point with a short portion inside the vessel, and a much larger portion outside. The rower pulls on the short end of the oar, while the long end is in the water. By contrast, paddles are held in both hands by the paddler, and are not attached to the vessel.

Rowers generally face the stern of the vessel, reach towards the stern, and insert the blade of their oar in the water. As they lean back, towards the vessel&#x27;s bow, the blade of their oars pivots in the oarlock, and the end in the water moves towards the stern, providing forward thrust.

For thousands of years vessels were powered either by sails, or by the mechanical work of rowers, or by paddlers. It is common for an oar propelled vessel to also have the option to be powered by sail, both in antiquity (for instance the galley) and more recently.

==History==
Rowing oars have been used since the early Neolithic period. Wooden oars, with canoe-shaped pottery, dating from 5000–4500 BC have been discovered in a Hemudu culture site at Yuyao, Zhejiang, in modern China. In 1999, an oar measuring 63.4 cm (2 ft) in length, dating from 4000 BC, was unearthed in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.

==Construction==
Oars have traditionally been made of wood. The form is a long shaft (or loom) with a flat blade on the end. Where the oar connects to the boat there is a &quot;collar&quot; (or button), often made of leather, which stops the oar slipping past the rowlock. Oars usually have a handle about 150mm long, which may be a material sleeve or alternatively an ovoid shape carved to fit the hands.

==Physics==

Oars are levers. Which class of lever depends on the frame of reference. From the rower&#x27;s perspective, the oar can be seen as a Class I lever. The oar is fixed in the oarlock, the rower pulls on the handle, and the blade moves in the opposite direction to propel the boat. The blade is further from the oarlock than the rower&#x27;s hands. So, the heavy force of a short rowing motion becomes a smaller force over a greater distance.

From an observer on the shore, the oar is instead a Class II lever. Here, the fulcrum is the &quot;blade&quot;, planted in the water. The rower pulls on the handle and the boat moves along with them. The &quot;Class II&quot; perspective is important to competitive rowing. Effective rowers learn to lever the boat past the end of the blade, rather than pulling the blade through the water. The World Rowing Federation rulebook defines oars as Class II.

Both the Class I and Class II perspectives can be used to calculate the forces on the rower, boat, and water, with equivalent results. The calculations are simpler for the Class I perspective. The mechanical advantage of the oar depends on the length of the oar from the oarlock to the blade, compared to the length from the oarlock to the rower&#x27;s hand(s). The further away from the oarlock the blade is, the more difficult it is to row and the more distance each stroke will move.

==Balanced oar==
This is a normal, usually wooden oar to which weight has been added at the inboard end so that the blade end is noticeably lighter and easier for a rower to operate without fatigue. The two methods of adding weight are to either have a much larger section in the oar immediately next to the handle for a distance of about or to drill an hole inside the handle for a distance of about and add about 12 oz of lead secured by epoxy resin glue. For a oar the balance point is about 12 inches outboard of the rowlock. Often surplus wood is removed from the blade&#x27;s width and thickness and at the neck between the blade and the shaft to further reduce outboard weight. As the rower is expending less energy accelerating the (now-reduced) mass of the oar back-and-forth, and will experience less fatigue constantly exerting downward force on the handle (vs. an unbalanced version) -- this type of oar is more efficient and thus preferable for long-range rowing.

== Oars used for transport ==
The oars used for transport come in a variety of sizes. The oars used in small dinghies or rafts can be less than 2 metres long. In classical times warships were propelled by very long oars that might have several oarsmen per oar. These oars could be more than a dozen metres long. According to Callixenus, as cited by Athenaeus, in the great ship of Ptolemy the oars of the upper tier were over in length with handles leaded so as to equalize the weight inboard and outboard.

== Oars used for competitive rowing ==
The oars used in competitive rowing are long (250–300 cm) poles with one flat end about 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, called the blade. The part of the oar the oarsman holds while rowing is called the handle. While rowing, the oars are supported by metal frames attached to the side of the boat called riggers, while the oar fits into the oarlocks at the ends of each rigger. Classic oars were made of wood, but modern oars are made from synthetic material, the most common being carbon fibre.

== Oars used as trophies ==
The sport of competitive rowing has developed a tradition of using an oar as a memento of significant race wins. A &#x27;trophy oar&#x27; is not presented at the end of the race as a more familiar precious metal cup might be, but rather given by the club, school or university that the winning crew or rower represented.

A trophy oar is a competition oar that has been painted in the club colours and has then had the details of the race signwritten on the face of the blade. The most common format has the coat of arms or crest of the club or school positioned in the centre, with the crew names and the race details arranged around this.

Many older universities (Oxford and Cambridge for example, as well as Yale and Harvard) and their colleges have long histories of using the trophy oar and many examples are on display in club houses around the world.

==In culture==

In Norway, both Fedje Municipality and Herøy Municipality both have oars in their coat of arms.

Oars have been used to describe various animals with characteristics that closely resemble the said rowing implement. The members of the Family Regalecidae, elongated deep-sea fishes, are called oarfish because their body shape is similar to that of an oar. The hawksbill turtle&#x27;s genus of Eretmochelys is derived from the Greek root &quot;eretmo&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;oar&quot;. The turtle was so-named because of the oar-like shape of its front flippers.

<doc id="248056" wikidata="Q215729" url="?curid=248056" title="Rule, Britannia!">
<text>&quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; is a British patriotic song, originating from the 1740 poem &quot;Rule, Britannia&quot; by James Thomson and set to music by Thomas Arne in the same year. It is most strongly associated with the Royal Navy, but is also used by the British Army.

== &quot;Alfred&quot; ==

The song was originally the final musical number in Thomas Arne&#x27;s &quot;Alfred&quot;, a masque about Alfred the Great, co-written by James Thomson and David Mallet and first performed at Cliveden, the country home of Frederick, Prince of Wales, on 1 August 1740.

The work was initially devised to commemorate the accession of Frederick&#x27;s grandfather George I and the birthday of the Princess Augusta.

== Lyrics ==

This version is taken from , which includes the entire text of &quot;Alfred&quot;.

== &quot;Married to a Mermaid&quot; ==
In 1751 Mallet re-used the text of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, omitting three of the original six stanzas and adding three new ones by Lord Bolingbroke, to form the repeated chorus of the comic song &quot;Married to a Mermaid&quot;. This became extremely popular when Mallet produced his masque &quot;Britannia&quot; at Drury Lane Theatre in 1755.

&quot;Married to a Mermaid&quot; tells the story of a young man, in some versions a sailor or a farmer, who falls overboard from a ship and is married to a mermaid, and later rises from the sea and says goodbye to his comrades and messmates and his ship&#x27;s captain. It is a traditional sailors&#x27; song and regularly performed by choirs, and its lyrics have many versions. A version written, composed and performed by Arthur Lloyd has the lyrics: 

The chorus, from &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;, is sometimes performed as: 

In this song, &quot;Married to a mermaid&quot; is pronounced as &quot;marry-i-ed to a mer-may-ed&quot;, and &quot;captain&quot; as &quot;cap-i-tain&quot;. Some versions replace &quot;broad Atlantic&quot; for &quot;deep Atlantic&quot;.

== Symbolism ==
&quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; soon developed an independent life of its own, separate from the masque of which it had formed a part. First heard in London in 1745, it achieved instant popularity. It quickly became so well known that Handel quoted it in his &quot;Occasional Oratorio&quot; in the following year. Handel used the first phrase as part of the Act II soprano aria, &quot;Prophetic visions strike my eye&quot;, when the soprano sings it at the words &quot;War shall cease, welcome peace!&quot; The song was seized upon by the Jacobites, who altered Thomson&#x27;s words to a pro-Jacobite version.

According to Armitage &quot;Rule, Britannia&quot; was the most lasting expression of the conception of Britain and the British Empire that emerged in the 1730s, &quot;predicated on a mixture of adulterated mercantilism, nationalistic anxiety and libertarian fervour&quot;. He equates the song with Bolingbroke&#x27;s &quot;On the Idea of a Patriot King&quot; (1738), also written for the private circle of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in which Bolingbroke had &quot;raised the spectre of permanent standing armies that might be turned against the British people rather than their enemies&quot;. Hence British naval power could be equated with civil liberty, since an island nation with a strong navy to defend it could afford to dispense with a standing army which, since the time of Cromwell, was seen as a threat and a source of tyranny.

At the time it appeared, the song was not a celebration of an existing state of naval affairs, but an exhortation. Although the Dutch Republic, which in the 17th century presented a major challenge to English sea power, was obviously past its peak by 1745, Britain did not yet &quot;rule the waves&quot;, although, since it was written during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, it could be argued that the words referred to the alleged Spanish aggression against British merchant vessels that caused the war. The time was still to come when the Royal Navy would be an unchallenged dominant force on the oceans. The jesting lyrics of the mid-18th century would assume a material and patriotic significance by the end of the 19th century.

&quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; is often written as simply &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, omitting both the comma and the exclamation mark, which changes the interpretation of the lyric by altering the punctuation. Richard Dawkins recounts in his 1976 book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; that the repeated exclamation &quot;Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!&quot; is often rendered as &quot;Rule, Britannia! Britannia rules the waves!&quot;, changing the meaning of the verse. This addition of a terminal &#x27;s&#x27; to the lyrics is used as an example of a successful meme.

Maurice Willson Disher notes that the change from &quot;Britannia, rule the waves&quot; to &quot;Britannia rules the waves&quot; occurred in the Victorian era, at a time when the British did rule the waves and no longer needed to be exhorted to rule them. Disher also notes that the Victorians changed &quot;will&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; in the line &quot;Britons never shall be slaves&quot;.

The song assumed extra significance in 1945 at the conclusion of World War II when it was played at the ceremonial surrender of the Japanese imperial army in Singapore. A massed military band of Australian, British and American forces played as Supreme Allied Commander Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma arrived.

&quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; (in an orchestral arrangement by Sir Malcolm Sargent) is traditionally performed at the BBC&#x27;s Last Night of the Proms, normally with a guest soloist (past performers have included Jane Eaglen, Bryn Terfel, Thomas Hampson, Joseph Calleja, and Felicity Lott). It has always been the last part of Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s 1905 Fantasia on British Sea Songs, except that for many years up until 2000, the Sargent arrangement has been used. However, in recent years the inclusion of the song and other patriotic tunes has been much criticised—notably by Leonard Slatkin—and the presentation has been occasionally amended. For some years the performance at the Last Night of the Proms reverted to Sir Henry Wood&#x27;s original arrangement. When Bryn Terfel performed it at the Proms in 1994 and 2008 he sang the third verse in Welsh. The text is available at &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; .

== Musical derivatives ==

Arne&#x27;s tune has been used by, or at least quoted by, a great many composers of which the following are a few examples.

The melody was the theme for a set of variations for piano by Ludwig van Beethoven (WoO 79, 1803) and he also used it in &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot;, Op. 91 (1813) and in extracted and varied form in the second movement of his Piano Sonata No. 24, Op. 78, &quot;À Thérèse&quot; (1809).

The music has been used for the American patriotic song &quot;Rise Columbia!&quot;

It was also quoted in &quot;Combat naval&quot; (&quot;Britannia: an allegorical overture&quot;) by Daniel Steibelt.

Richard Wagner wrote a concert overture in D major based on the theme in 1837 (WWV 42). He subsequently made it the basis of his &quot;Große Sonata&quot; for piano, Op. 4.
Ferdinand Ries quotes from it in &quot;The Dream&quot; (also known as &quot;Il sogno&quot;) for piano, Op. 49, and wrote Variations on Rule Britannia for orchestra, Op. 116.
Johann Strauss I quoted the song in full as the introduction to his 1838 waltz &quot;Huldigung der Königin Victoria von Grossbritannien&quot; (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain), Op. 103, where he also quotes the British national anthem &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; at the end of the piece.

The French organist-composer Alexandre Guilmant included this tune in his &quot;Fantaisie sur deux mélodies anglaises&quot; for organ Op. 43, where he also makes use of the song &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot;. Likewise, the French composer Alexandre Goria used the tune as part of his &quot;Salut à la Grande Brétagne&quot; - Six airs anglese transcrite et variée, 1re. Suite No. 8, Op. 44.

Arthur Sullivan quoted from &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; on at least three occasions in music for his comic operas written with W. S. Gilbert and Bolton Rowe. In &quot;Utopia, Limited&quot; (1893), Sullivan used airs from &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; to highlight references to Great Britain. In &quot;The Zoo&quot; (written with Rowe in 1875) Sullivan applied the tune of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; to an instance in which Rowe&#x27;s libretto quotes directly from the patriotic march. Finally, to celebrate the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, Sullivan added a chorus of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; to the finale of &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot;, which was playing in revival at the Savoy Theatre. Sullivan also quoted the tune in his 1897 ballet &quot;Victoria and Merrie England&quot;, which traced the &quot;history&quot; of England from the time of the Druids up to Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee, which the work was meant to celebrate.

==Chart performance==
During the 2020 BBC Proms, held at the Royal Albert Hall, London, a recorded version of the song featuring Welsh mezzo-soprano Della Jones charted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart.

<text>The &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; is an Irish air (folk tune) that originated in County Londonderry, first recorded in the nineteenth century. The tune is played as the victory sporting anthem of Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games. The song &quot;Danny Boy&quot; written by English lawyer Fred Weatherly uses the tune, with a set of lyrics written in the early 20th century.

==History==
The title of the air came from the name of County Londonderry, and was collected by Jane Ross of Limavady in the county.

Ross submitted the tune to music collector George Petrie, and it was then published by the Society for the Preservation and Publication of the Melodies of Ireland in the 1855 book &quot;The Ancient Music of Ireland&quot;, which Petrie edited. The tune was listed as an anonymous air, with a note attributing its collection to Jane Ross of Limavady.

For the following beautiful air I have to express my very grateful acknowledgement to Miss J. Ross, of New Town, Limavady, in the County of Londonderry—a lady who has made a large collection of the popular unpublished melodies of the county, which she has very kindly placed at my disposal, and which has added very considerably to the stock of tunes which I had previously acquired from that still very Irish county. I say still very Irish, for though it has been planted for more than two centuries by English and Scottish settlers, the old Irish race still forms the great majority of its peasant inhabitants; and there are few, if any counties in which, with less foreign admixture, the ancient melodies of the country have been so extensively preserved. The name of the tune unfortunately was not ascertained by Miss Ross, who sent it to me with the simple remark that it was &#x27;very old&#x27;, in the correctness of which statement I have no hesitation in expressing my perfect concurrence.

This led to the descriptive title &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; being used for the piece.

The origin of the tune was for a long time somewhat mysterious, as no other collector of folk tunes encountered it, and all known examples are descended from Ross&#x27;s submission to Petrie&#x27;s collection. In a 1934 article, Anne Geddes Gilchrist suggested that the performer whose tune Ross heard, played the song with extreme rubato, causing Ross to mistake the time signature of the piece for common time () rather than . Gilchrist asserted that adjusting the rhythm of the piece as she proposed produced a tune more typical of Irish folk music.

In 1974, Hugh Shields found a long-forgotten traditional song which was very similar to Gilchrist&#x27;s modified version of the melody. The song, &quot;Aislean an Oigfear&quot; (&quot;recte&quot; &quot;Aisling an Óigfhir&quot;, &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Dream&quot;), had been transcribed by Edward Bunting in 1792 based on a performance by harper Donnchadh Ó Hámsaigh (Denis Hempson) at the Belfast Harp Festival, and the tune would later become well known far outside of Ireland as &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot;. Bunting published it in 1796. Ó Hámsaigh lived in Magilligan, not far from Ross&#x27;s home in Limavady. Hempson died in 1807.

In 2000, Brian Audley showed how the distinctive high section of the tune had derived from a refrain in &quot;The Young Man&#x27;s Dream&quot; which, over time, crept into the body of the music. He also discovered the original words to the tune as we now know it, which were written by Edward Fitzsimmons and published in 1814; his song is &quot;The Confession of Devorgilla&quot;, otherwise known by its first line &quot;Oh Shrive Me Father&quot;.

The descendants of blind fiddler Jimmy McCurry assert that he is the musician from whom Miss Ross transcribed the tune but there is no historical evidence to support this speculation. A similar claim has been made regarding the tune&#x27;s &#x27;coming&#x27; to the blind itinerant harpist Rory Dall O&#x27;Cahan in a dream. A documentary detailing this version was broadcast on Maryland Public Television in the United States in March 2000; reference to this was also made by historian John Hamilton in Michael Portillo&#x27;s TV programme &quot;Great British Railway Journeys Goes to Ireland&quot; in February 2012.

==Lyrical settings==

===Danny Boy===

The most popular lyrics for the tune are &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (&quot;Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling&quot;), written by English lawyer Frederic Edward Weatherly in 1910, and set to the tune in 1913.

===The Confession of Devorgilla===
The first lyrics to be sung to the music were, &quot;The Confession of Devorgilla&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;Oh! shrive me, father&quot;.

:&#x27;Oh! shrive me, father – haste, haste, and shrive me,
:&#x27;Ere sets yon dread and flaring sun;
:&#x27;Its beams of peace, – nay, of sense, deprive me,
:&#x27;Since yet the holy work&#x27;s undone.&#x27;
:The sage, the wand&#x27;rer&#x27;s anguish balming,
:Soothed her heart to rest once more;
:And pardon&#x27;s promise torture calming,
:The Pilgrim told her sorrows o&#x27;er.
The first writer, after Petrie&#x27;s publication, to set verses to the tune was Alfred Perceval Graves, in the late 1870s. His song was entitled &quot;Would I Were Erin&#x27;s Apple Blossom o&#x27;er You&quot;. Graves later stated &quot;that setting was, to my mind, too much in the style of church music, and was not, I believe, a success in consequence.&quot;

:Would I were Erin&#x27;s apple-blossom o&#x27;er you,
:Or Erin&#x27;s rose, in all its beauty blown,
:To drop my richest petals down before you,
:Within the garden where you walk alone;
:In hope you&#x27;d turn and pluck a little posy,
:With loving fingers through my foliage pressed,
:And kiss it close and set it blushing rosy
:To sigh out all its sweetness on your breast.

===Irish Love Song===
Katherine Tynan Hinkson published the words of &quot;Irish Love Song&quot; in 1892. Graves set these words to the tune in his 1894 &quot;Irish Song Book&quot;, where the tune was first referred to descriptively as &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; (unlike the names of properly-titled airs in the songbook, &quot;Londonderry Air&quot; was not placed in quotation marks).
:Would God I were the tender apple blossom
:That floats and falls from off the twisted bough
:To lie and faint within your silken bosom
:Within your silken bosom as that does now.
:Or would I were a little burnish&#x27;d apple
:For you to pluck me, gliding by so cold,
:While sun and shade your robe of lawn will dapple,
:Your robe of lawn and your hair of spun gold.

===Hymns===
As with a good many folk tunes, Londonderry Air is also used as a hymn tune; most notably for &quot;I cannot tell&quot; by William Young Fullerton.

:I cannot tell why He Whom angels worship,
:Should set His love upon the sons of men,
:Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wanderers,
:To bring them back, they know not how or when.
:But this I know, that He was born of Mary
:When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,
:And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured,
:And so the Saviour, Saviour of the world is come.

It was also used as a setting for &quot;I would be true&quot; by Howard Arnold Walter at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales:

:I would be true, for there are those that trust me.
:I would be pure, for there are those that care.
:I would be strong, for there is much to suffer.
:I would be brave, for there is much to dare.
:I would be friend of all, the foe, the friendless.
:I would be giving, and forget the gift,
:I would be humble, for I know my weakness,
:I would look up, and laugh, and love and live.

&quot;Londonderry Air&quot; was also used as the tune for the southern gospel hit &quot;He Looked Beyond My Fault&quot;, written by Dottie Rambo and first recorded by her group, The Rambos, in 1968.

Other hymns sung to this tune are:
*&quot;O Christ the same through all our story’s pages&quot; – Timothy Dudley-Smith
*&quot;O Dreamer Leave Thy Dreams For Joyful Waking&quot;
*&quot;I Love Thee So&quot;
*&quot;My Own Dear Land&quot;
*&quot;We Shall Go Out With Hope of Resurrection&quot;
*&quot;Above the Hills of Time the Cross Is Gleaming&quot;
*&quot;Lord of the Church, We Pray for our Renewing&quot; – Timothy Dudley-Smith
*&quot;Above the Voices of the World Around Me&quot;
*&quot;What Grace is Mine&quot; – Kristyn Getty
*&quot;O Son of Man our hero strong and tender&quot;
*&quot;Since Long Ago&quot; – Watchman Nee
*&quot;O Loving God&quot; – Paulette M. McCoy
*&quot;Go, silent friend&quot;, by John L. Bell and Graham Maule 

===In Derry Vale===
W. G. Rothery, a British lyricist (1858-1930) who wrote the English lyrics for songs such as Handel&#x27;s &quot;Art Thou Troubled&quot;, wrote the following lyrics to the tune of &quot;The Londonderry Air&quot;:

:In Derry Vale, beside the singing river,
:so oft&#x27; I strayed, ah, many years ago,
:and culled at morn the golden daffodillies
:that came with spring to set the world aglow.
:Oh, Derry Vale, my thoughts are ever turning
:to your broad stream and fairy-circled lee.
:For your green isles my exiled heart is yearning,
:so far away across the sea.

:In Derry Vale, amid the Foyle&#x27;s dark waters,
:the salmon leap, beside the surging weir.
:The seabirds call, I still can hear them calling
:in night&#x27;s long dreams of those so dear.
:Oh, tarrying years, fly faster, ever faster,
:I long to see that vale belov&#x27;d so well,
:I long to know that I am not forgotten,
:And there in home in peace to dwell.

===Far Away===
George Sigerson wrote a poem that T. R. G. Jozé set to this tune in 1901. This setting was popularized in the early 20th century by the Glasgow Orpheus Choir under Sir Hugh S. Roberton.

:As chimes that flow o&#x27;er shining seas
:When morn alights on meads of May,
:Faint voices fill the western breeze,
:With whisp&#x27;ring song from far away.
:O dear the dells of Dunavore
:A home in od&#x27;rous Ossory,
:But sweet as honey running o&#x27;er,
:The golden shore of Far Away.

:There sings the voice whose wondrous tune
:Falls like a diamond shower above,
:That in the radiant dawn of June,
:Renew a world of youth and love.
:Oh fair the founts of Farranfore
:And bright is billowy Ballintrae,
:But sweet as honey running o&#x27;er,
:The golden shore of Far Away.

===Other===
* A. P. Herbert&#x27;s poem &quot;Let Us Be Glad&quot;, written for the conclusion of the 1948 Summer Olympics, and sung at the end of the event, used the melody.
* An arrangement of the song has also been used in the anime short &quot;Cross Road&quot; by Akifumi Tada with lyrics in Japanese by Makoto Shinkai and Nagi Yanagi as the singer.
* The song was arranged by a Japanese composer Satoshi Takebe with lyrics in Japanese by a Japanese female singer Minami Kizuki in 2009. The title of the arranged song is &quot;紅 (Kurenai)&quot;.

The Amami Islands are located in the southwest part of Japan, where she was born and raised.

<text>Arthur Dee (13 July 1579 – September or October 1651) was a physician and alchemist. He became a physician successively to Tsar Michael I of Russia and to King Charles I of England.

==Youth==
Dee was the eldest son of John Dee by his third wife, Jane, daughter of Bartholomew Fromond of East Cheam, Surrey. He was born at Mortlake on 13 July 1579. As a child he accompanied his father on travels through Germany, Poland and Bohemia. After his return to England he was placed at Westminster School, on 3 May 1592, under the tuition of Edward Grant and William Camden. Anthony Wood was informed that he subsequently studied at Oxford, but he took no degree and it is not known which college he attended.

==Medicine==
Settling in London with the intention of practising &quot;physic&quot; (medicine), he exhibited at the door of his house a list of medicines which were said to be certain cures for many diseases. The censors of the College of Physicians summoned him to appear before them, but it is not known what the outcome was. Proceeding to Manchester, Dee married Isabella, daughter of Edward Prestwych, a justice of the peace.

Through the recommendation of James I Dee was appointed one of the physicians to the Tsar Michael I of Russia. He remained in Russia for about 14 years, principally in Moscow. There he wrote his &quot;Fasciculus Chemicus&quot;, a collection of writings on alchemy.

Returning to England on the death of his wife in 1637, Dee became physician to King Charles I. On his retirement, Arthur Dee moved to Norwich, where he became a friend of Sir Thomas Browne. His relationship to Browne has been little explored, one literary critic speculating on it: 
==The philosopher&#x27;s stone==
In 2018, Megan Piorko, a PhD student at Georgia State University, discovered a coded text in one of Dee&#x27;s alchemical notebooks purporting to contain a recipe for the so-called philosopher&#x27;s stone, a mythical elixir of life capable of changing base metals into gold or silver and of imparting immortality. Piorko and digital humanities scholar Sarah Lang published the full text in September 2021. It was deciphered later that year by the mathematician and cryptologist Richard Bean of the University of Queensland.

The decoded text describes the processing of an alchemical &quot;egg&quot; in an athanor, a slow-burning furnace popular with alchemists. Then there must be a wait for the three universal alchemical phases to occur: black, white, and red. If all steps are followed correctly, &quot;you will have a truly gold-making elixir by whose benevolence all the misery of poverty is put to flight and those who suffer from any illness will be restored to health,&quot; the text states.

==Death and aftermath==
Arthur Dee, having fathered six sons and six daughters, died in September or October 1651 and was buried in St George&#x27;s Church, Tombland, Norwich. Most of his alchemical manuscripts and books were bequeathed to Sir Thomas Browne.

In the early 20th century, Rasputin stole a number of Arthur Dee&#x27;s Russian translations of his father&#x27;s writings. These were later reclaimed by the Romanov family and returned to the Imperial Library in Moscow.

<doc id="248071" wikidata="Q212939" url="?curid=248071" title="Solidago">
<text>Solidago, commonly called goldenrods, is a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Most are herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are mostly native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia. Some American species have also been introduced into Europe and other parts of the world.

==Description==

&quot;Solidago&quot; species are perennials growing from woody caudices or rhizomes. Their stems range from decumbent (crawling) to ascending or erect, with a range of heights going from to over a meter. Most species are unbranched, but some do display branching in the upper part of the plant. Both leaves and stems vary from glabrous (hairless) to various forms of pubescence (strigose, strigillose, hispid, stipitate-glandular or villous). In some species, the basal leaves are shed before flowering. The leaf margins are most commonly entire, but often display heavier serration. Some leaves may display trinerved venation rather than the pinnate venation usual across Asteraceae.

The flower heads are usually of the radiate type (typical daisy flower heads with distinct ray and disc florets) but sometimes discoid (with only disc florets of mixed, sterile, male and types). Only ray florets are female, others are male, hermaphroditic or entire sterile. Head involucres are campanulate to cylindric or attenuate. Floret corollas are usually yellow, but white in the ray florets of a few species (such as &quot;Solidago bicolor&quot;); they are typically hairless. Heads usually include between 2 and 35 disc florets, but in some species this may go up to 60. Filaments are inserted closer to the base of the corolla than its middle. Numerous heads are usually grouped in complex compound inflorescences where heads are arranged in multiple racemes, panicles, corymbs, or secund arrays (with florets all on the same side).

&quot;Solidago&quot; cypselae are narrowly obconic to cylindrical in shape, and they are sometimes somewhat compressed. They have eight to 10 ribs usually and are hairless or moderately hispid. The pappus is very big with barbellate bristles.

The many goldenrod species can be difficult to distinguish, due to their similar bright, golden-yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. Propagation is by wind-disseminated seeds or by spreading underground rhizomes which can form colonies of vegetative clones of a single plant. They are mostly short-day plants and bloom in late summer and early fall. Some species produce abundant nectar when moisture is plentiful, or when the weather is warm and sunny.

The section &quot;Ptarmicoidei&quot; is sometimes treated as a separate genus &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, and is dropped by flat-topped to rounded corymbiform flowerheads.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Solidago&quot; is in the family Asteraceae (formerly known as Compositae), a diverse and widespread clade containing approximately 23,000 species and 12 tribes, which inhabit all continents except Antarctica. Within Asteraceae, &quot;Solidago&quot; is in the tribe Astereae and the subtribe Solidagininaeae.

The genus &quot;Solidago&quot; is monophyletic as indicated by morphological characters and molecular evidence. All &quot;Solidago&quot; species are herbaceous perennials, growing from approximately 2 cm to 2.5 m tall. Yellow to white, pistillate ray flowers and yellow, perfect disc florets are characteristic of &quot;Solidago&quot; inflorescences, which have a wide range of shapes. Molecular studies using nuclear rDNA have hypothesized boundaries on the genus &quot;Solidago&quot;, but there have been difficulties in parsing out evolutionary relationships at the sub-genus scale and defining which should be included and separated from &quot;Solidago&quot;.

===&quot;Solidago&quot; and related taxa===
Related Asteraceae genera, such as &quot;Chrysoma&quot;, &quot;Euthamia&quot;, and &quot;Oreochrysum&quot;, have been included within &quot;Solidago&quot; at one point or another, but morphological evidence has suggested otherwise. In a study comparing morphological characters of &quot;Solidago&quot; and related subgroups, the authors consider the subjectivity of classifying a genus and how to define it within broader tendencies concerning the taxonomy of North American Asteraceae. Little to no differences were observed between &quot;Solidago&quot; and the subgroups in terms of karyotype. However, external morphological characters such as habit, or the general appearance of the plant and how a suite of traits contribute to its phenotype; pappus size; and the point of freeing of stamen filaments from the corolla tube, are useful classification schemes for &quot;Solidago&quot;, since they are applied to differentiating between Asteraceae taxa. One school of Asteraceae taxonomy thought unites all taxa sharing similar floral head structure and subsequently ignores deviation from this morphology, while another places greater weight on these morphological deviations. The authors argue that the latter opinion should be applied. Since there is no theoretical foundation for relative taxonomic importance of traits, they assert that habit should be a central trait when defining taxa, and subsequently that all the subgroups considered in their study (&quot;Brachychaeta&quot;, &quot;Chrysoma&quot;, &quot;Euthamia&quot;, &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, and &quot;Petradoria&quot;) should be segregated from &quot;Solidago&quot;.

Results from a leaf anatomy study comparing differences in mesophyll, bundle sheath extensions, and midvein structure, among others in a suite of leaf traits, are incongruent with those in an earlier study. Based on the lack of bundle sheath extensions, it is suggested that &quot;Chrysoma&quot;, &quot;Euthamia&quot;, &quot;Gundlachia&quot;, and &quot;Petradoria&quot; should be distinct taxa and outside of &quot;Solidago&quot;. However, &quot;Brachychaeta&quot;, &quot;Brintonia&quot;, &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, &quot;Oreochrysum&quot;, and &quot;Aster ptarmicoides&quot; should be considered as components of &quot;Solidago&quot;. To summarize, the relation of &quot;Brachychaeta&quot; and &quot;Oligoneuron&quot; to &quot;Solidago&quot; is inconsistent based on these results. Both support the separation of &quot;Chrysoma&quot;, &quot;Euthamia&quot;, and &quot;Petradoria&quot; from &quot;Solidago&quot;. A study reviews the taxonomic position of &quot;Oligoneuron&quot; relative to &quot;Solidago&quot;, as based on taxonomic evidence, treats it as separate from &quot;Solidago&quot;, similarly to Kapoor &amp; Beaudry (1966). The first molecular phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA treats &quot;Brachychaeta&quot;, &quot;Brintonia&quot;, &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, and &quot;Oreochrysum&quot; as constituents of &quot;Solidago&quot;. Using consensus trees from ITS data, another study found support for &quot;Oligoneuron&quot; as part of &quot;Solidago&quot;, and the findings of Zhang (1996). More recently, an analysis of combined ITS and ETS data provided additional support for the inclusion of &quot;Oligoneuron&quot; as part of &quot;Solidago&quot;.

Until the 1980s, the genus &quot;Euthamia&quot; was largely considered to be a part of &quot;Solidago&quot; due to morphological similarities between species in both genera, and a history of synonymy of &quot;Solidago lanceolata&quot; and &quot;Euthamia graminifolia&quot;. As mentioned, the lack of bundle sheath extensions in &quot;Euthamia&quot; compared to &quot;Solidago&quot;, and deviations in floral morphology present evidence for separation of these taxa. A taxonomy of &quot;Euthamia&quot; as a genus was presented, providing a detailed description of distinguishing external morphological characters, such as fibrous-roots, sessile leaves, and mostly corymbiform inflorescences.

===Evolutionary relationships within &quot;Solidago&quot;===
Chromosome counts and advances in molecular systematics have enabled greater understanding of evolutionary relationships within &quot;Solidago&quot;. At the time a taxonomy of &quot;Solidago&quot; was published, related taxa causing contention, such as &quot;Chrysoma&quot;, &quot;Euthamia&quot;, &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;, and &quot;Petradoria&quot;, were excluded from this genus. The number of &quot;Solidago&quot; species has remained relatively stable, around 120, with approximately 80 in North America. Due to monophyletic support for the New World taxa and taxonomic difficulties with Old World taxa, the taxonomy provided in the 1990s only includes North American taxa and thus treats &quot;Solidago&quot; as non-monophyletic. Existing molecular-based phylogenies provide monophyletic support for &quot;Solidago&quot; given its inclusion of &quot;Oligoneuron&quot;.

Chromosome counts have proven to be a valuable character in &quot;Solidago&quot; taxonomy and in elucidating the cytogeographic history of the genus. Similar chromosome counts may indicate close evolutionary relationships, while different chromosome numbers may suggest distant relationships through reproductive isolation. Chromosome counts have been studied extensively in North America; all &quot;Solidago&quot; species have a base chromosome number of x=9, but the following ploidy levels have been observed: 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 12x, and 14x.

Though negligible differences in karyotype among &quot;Solidago&quot; and related genera were found, &quot;Solidago&quot; taxa with multiple cytotypes are more common than those with one. Although chromosome count is a useful metric for differentiating among &quot;Solidago&quot; taxa, it may be problematic due to the frequent variation in ploidy levels. Cytogeographic patterns in the &quot;Solidago gigantea&quot; complex, with tetraploids occurring in eastern North America and hexaploids in Oregon and Washington, were observed. Cytogeographic patterns are also observed in the &quot;Solidago canadensis&quot; complex: hexaploids within &quot;S. canadensis&quot; have been observed east of the Great Plains and are treated as &quot;Solidago altissima&quot;, and diploids and tetraploids occurring in the Great Plains are treated as &quot;Solidago gilvocanescens&quot;. The taxonomic status of &quot;Solidago ptarmicoides&quot; created an extensive debate due to frequency hybridization of &quot;S. ptarmicoides&quot; with members of the &quot;Ptarmicoidei&quot; section of &quot;Solidago&quot;. It was asserted that &quot;S. ptarmicoides&quot; should be united with &quot;Solidago&quot; rather than the genus &quot;Aster&quot; due to external morphological features such as similar pappus length as well as the same chromosome base (x=9). Information about chromosome number is still a crucial part of current understanding and phylogenies of &quot;Solidago&quot;.

== Ecology ==
Goldenrod is considered a keystone species, and has been called the single most important plant for North American pollinator biodiversity. Goldenrod species are used as a food source by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species. As many as 104 species of butterflies and moths use it as a host plant for their larvae, and 42 species of bees are goldenrod specialists, visiting only goldenrod for food. Some lepidopteran larvae bore into plant tissues and form a bulbous tissue mass called a gall around it, upon which the larva then feeds. Various parasitoid wasps find these galls and lay eggs in the larvae, penetrating the bulb with their ovipositors. Woodpeckers are known to peck open the galls and eat the insects in the center.

Goldenrods have become invasive species in many parts of the world outside their native range, including China, Japan, Europe and Africa. &quot;Solidago canadensis&quot;, which was introduced as a garden plant in Central Europe, has become common in the wild, and in Germany is considered an invasive species that displaces native vegetation from its natural habitat.

==Use and cultivation==
Young goldenrod leaves are edible. Traditionally, Native Americans use the seeds of some species for food. Herbal teas are sometimes made with goldenrod.

Goldenrod often is inaccurately said to cause hay fever in humans. The pollen causing this allergic reaction is produced mainly by ragweed (&quot;Ambrosia&quot; sp.), blooming at the same time as the goldenrod and pollinated by wind. Goldenrod pollen is too heavy and sticky to be blown far from the flowers, and is pollinated mainly by insects. Frequent handling of goldenrod and other flowers, however, can cause allergic reactions, sometimes irritating enough to force florists to change occupation. Goldenrods are attractive sources of nectar for bees, flies, wasps, and butterflies. Honey from goldenrods often is dark and strong because of admixtures of other nectars. However, when honey flow is strong, a light (often water-clear), spicy-tasting monofloral honey is produced. While the bees are ripening the honey produced from goldenrods, it has a rank odour and taste; the finished honey is much milder.

Goldenrods are, in some places, considered a sign of good luck or good fortune. They are considered weeds by many in North America, but they are seen as invasive plants in Europe, where British gardeners adopted goldenrod as a garden subject. Goldenrod began to gain some acceptance in U.S. gardening (other than wildflower gardening) during the 1980s.

Cultivated goldenrods include &quot;S. bicolor&quot;, &quot;S. caesia&quot;, &quot;S. canadensis&quot;, &quot;S. cutleri&quot;, &quot;S. riddellii,&quot; &quot;S. rigida&quot;, &quot;S. shortii&quot;, and &quot;S. virgaurea&quot;.

A number of cultivars have been selected, including several of hybrid origin. A putative hybrid with aster, known as ×&quot;Solidaster&quot; is less unruly, with pale yellow flowers, equally suitable for dried arrangements. Molecular and other evidence points to ×&quot;Solidaster&quot; (at least the cultivar &#x27;Lemore&#x27;) being a hybrid of &quot;Solidago ptarmicoides&quot; and &quot;Solidago canadensis&quot;, the former now in &quot;Solidago&quot;, but likely the &quot;aster&quot; in question.

The cultivars &#x27;Goldenmosa&#x27;
and &quot;S.&quot; × &quot;luteus&quot; &#x27;Lemore&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

===Industrial use===
Inventor Thomas Edison experimented with goldenrod to produce rubber, which it contains naturally. Edison created a fertilization and cultivation process to maximize the rubber content in each plant. His experiments produced a plant that yielded as much as 12% rubber, and the new variant was named &quot;Solidago edisoni&quot;, also called &quot;Solidago edisoniana&quot;. The tires on the Model T given to him by his friend Henry Ford were made from goldenrod. Like George Washington Carver, Henry Ford was deeply interested in the regenerative properties of soil and the potential of alternative crops such as peanuts and soybeans to produce plastics, paint, fuel and other products. 

Ford had long believed that the world would eventually need a substitute for gasoline, and supported the production of ethanol (or grain alcohol) as an alternative fuel. In 1942, he would showcase a car with a lightweight plastic body made from soybeans. Ford and Carver began corresponding via letter in 1934, and their mutual admiration deepened after George Washington Carver made a visit to Michigan in 1937. As Douglas Brinkley writes in &quot;Wheels for the World&quot;, his history of Ford, the automaker donated generously to the Tuskegee Institute, helping finance Carver&#x27;s experiments, and Carver in turn spent a period of time helping to oversee crops at the Ford plantation in Ways, Georgia.

By the time World War II began, Ford had made repeated journeys to Tuskegee to convince George Washington Carver to come to Dearborn and help him develop a synthetic rubber to help compensate for wartime rubber shortages. Carver arrived on July 19, 1942, and set up a laboratory in an old water works building in Dearborn. He and Ford experimented with different crops, including sweet potatoes and dandelions, eventually devising a way to make the rubber substitute from goldenrod, a plant weed commercially viable. Carver died in January 1943, Ford in April 1947, but the relationship between their two institutions continued to flourish: As recently as the late 1990s, Ford awarded grants of $4 million over two years to the George Washington Carver School at Tuskegee.

Extensive process development was conducted during World War II to commercialize goldenrod as a source of rubber. The rubber is only contained in the leaves, not the stems or blooms. Typical rubber content of the leaves is 7%. The resulting rubber is of low molecular weight, resulting in an excessively tacky compound with poor tensile properties.

===Traditional medicine===
&quot;Solidago virgaurea&quot; is used in a traditional kidney tonic by practitioners of herbal medicine to counter inflammation and irritation caused by bacterial infections or kidney stones. Goldenrod is also used in some formulas for cleansing of the kidney or bladder during a healing fast, in conjunction with potassium broth and specific juices. Some Native American cultures traditionally chew the leaves to relieve sore throats, and the roots to relieve toothaches.

===Medicinal exploration===
In various assessments by the European Medicines Agency with respect to &quot;Solidago virgaurea&quot;, non-clinical data shows diuretic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and spasmolytic, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer and immunomodulatory activity. However, as no single ingredient is responsible for these effects, the whole herbal preparation of &quot;Solidago&quot; inflorescences must be considered as the active ingredient.

==Cultural significance==
The goldenrod is the state flower of the U.S. states of Kentucky (adopted 1926) and Nebraska (adopted 1895). &quot;Solidago altissima&quot;, tall goldenrod, was named the state wildflower of South Carolina in 2003. The sweet goldenrod (&quot;Solidago odora&quot;) is the state herb of Delaware. Goldenrod was the state flower of Alabama, but it was later rejected in favor of the camellia.

<doc id="248074" wikidata="Q6958895" url="?curid=248074" title="USS Gallery">
<text>USS &quot;Gallery&quot; (FFG-26), eighteenth ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for three brothers: Rear Admiral Daniel V. Gallery (1901–1977), Rear Admiral William O. Gallery (1904–1981), and Rear Admiral Philip D. Gallery (1907–1973). Ordered from Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 28 February 1977 as part of the FY77 program, &quot;Gallery&quot; was laid down on 17 May 1980, launched on 20 December 1980, co-sponsored by Mrs. Philip D. Gallery and Mrs. Daniel V. Gallery, and commissioned on 5 December 1981. Decommissioned and stricken on 14 June 1996, she was transferred to Egypt on 25 September 1996 as &quot;Taba&quot; (F916). , she remained in active service with the Egyptian Navy.

&quot;Gallery&quot; was the first ship of that name in the US Navy.

==Coat of arms==
===Shield===
The colors green and gold, and the rampant lions have been adapted from a personal device of the Gallery family. The lions, symbolic of courage and strength, face in different directions indicating that the brothers for whom this ship is named, served in both theaters of operation during World War II. The star alludes to their many awards, and denote excellence and achievement. The crossed swords, adapted from the Officer and Enlisted badges, allude to Naval Combat Operations.

===Crest===
Blue and gold are the colors traditionally associated with the Navy. The upraised arm in green and gold is an adaptation from the Gallery family device. The collared and chained sea-wolf symbolizes the only capture of a U-boat from the German wolf-packs during World War II. The crest also symbolizes the curbing and destruction of the enemy sub activities in the Pacific theatre.

===Motto===
Manu Forti – &quot;With a Strong Hand&quot;

<text>Peter Trewavas (born 15 January 1959) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of the progressive rock band Marillion. He joined in 1982, replacing Diz Minnitt, while acting as a backing vocalist and occasional guitarist.

== Biography ==
Trewavas was born in Middlesbrough, but spent much of his childhood in the Buckinghamshire town of Aylesbury. It was in Aylesbury that he became involved in several bands, having the most success with The Metros, before taking up his long-term role in Marillion.

Trewavas is also a member of the progressive rock supergroup Transatlantic. In 2004, he co-founded another group called Kino, with John Mitchell (Arena), John Beck (It Bites) and Chris Maitland (ex-Porcupine Tree).

In 2011, Pete Trewavas joined up with his longtime friend Eric Blackwood to form the duo Edison&#x27;s Children. The new project was designed to be a creative outlet for Pete Trewavas (who has traditionally recorded in a &quot;band&quot; or &quot;group&quot; format on bass and acoustic guitar), in which he could also play lead guitar, lead vocals, drum programming and keyboards as well as have full creative control over the writing and producing of the record with. The 72-minute concept album &quot;In The Last Waking Moments...&quot; about a man fighting to understand if a recent bizarre happening was reality or a descent into madness, was released on 11.11.11.

The Edison&#x27;s Children project would result in the release of the single &quot;A Million Miles Away (I Wish I Had A Time Machine)&quot;. The song debuted on American Commercial Radio in June 2012 and by September it had reached the FMQB U.S. Commercial Radio Top 40 where it remained for 10 weeks (and stayed in the top 100 for 25 weeks) peaking at No. 32.

Edison&#x27;s Children did live performances in Montreal, Wolverhampton England and Port Zélande Netherlands opening up for Marillion&#x27;s &quot;Brave&quot; performances during the Marillion 2013 Weekend. The Montreal show was recorded and released as a B-Side on their &quot;In the Last Waking Moments...&quot;-EP Single. The UK show was released on their latest album &quot;Somewhere Between Here and There&quot;.

Edison&#x27;s Children released their second album, &quot;The Final Breath Before November&quot;, on 13 December 2013. It was mixed by Jakko Jakszyk, lead singer of King Crimson, John Mitchell, lead guitarist of It Bites, and Arena and Robin Boult, lead guitarist of Fish. The album featured Eric Blackwood on lead vocals and guitar and composition again along with Henry Rogers of DeeExpus and Touchstone. Pete Trewavas co-wrote and produced the album with Eric Blackwood and played lead guitar and lead vocals on many of tracks along with bass and programming for the symphonic orchestration.

Edison&#x27;s Children is expecting their third album &quot;Somewhere Between Here and There&quot;, a &quot;bridge album&quot; containing seven new songs and six original mixes from The Final Breath Before November by King Crimson&#x27;s Jakko Jakszyk and John Mitchell, along with the live version of A Million Miles Away from Wolves UK to be released in June 2015. Work has already begun on a 4th epic album which is expected to be much &quot;harder&quot; than the more symphonic The Final Breath Before November.

On 17 September 2012, during a Marillion concert at The Junction in Cambridge, Steve Hogarth announced that Trewavas was now called &quot;Sweet Pea Tremendous&quot; as it was the result of putting his name into an anagram solver.

Trewavas has also appeared in Prog Aid, the charity project set up to raise money for victims of the 2004 tsunami.

Trewavas was a guest musician on English progressive rock band Big Big Train&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;The Difference Machine&quot;.

Primarily a bassist, Trewavas has also been known to write keyboard parts during his time with Transatlantic, and has played acoustic guitar on Marillion songs, particularly &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Now She&#x27;ll Never Know&quot;. With Edison&#x27;s Children, Trewavas commonly contributed lead guitar, lead vocals, programming, guitar synthesizer, drum programming and several Middle Eastern instruments.

On 11 January 1999, Trewavas was hit by a motorist when cycling home from the studio Racket Club. He suffered multiple injuries and spent time in intensive care, and underwent surgery on his leg.

Trewavas is a fan of the football team Manchester United F.C.

<text>In set theory, an uncountable cardinal is inaccessible if it cannot be obtained from smaller cardinals by the usual operations of cardinal arithmetic. More precisely, a cardinal is strongly inaccessible if it satisfies the following three conditions: it is uncountable, it is not a sum of fewer than cardinals smaller than , and formula_1 implies formula_2.

The term &quot;inaccessible cardinal&quot; is ambiguous. Until about 1950, it meant &quot;weakly inaccessible cardinal&quot;, but since then it usually means &quot;strongly inaccessible cardinal&quot;. An uncountable cardinal is weakly inaccessible if it is a regular weak limit cardinal. It is strongly inaccessible, or just inaccessible, if it is a regular strong limit cardinal (this is equivalent to the definition given above). Some authors do not require weakly and strongly inaccessible cardinals to be uncountable (in which case is strongly inaccessible). Weakly inaccessible cardinals were introduced by , and strongly inaccessible ones by and ; in the latter they were referred to along with formula_3 as &quot;Grenzzahlen&quot; (English &quot;limit numbers&quot;).

Every strongly inaccessible cardinal is also weakly inaccessible, as every strong limit cardinal is also a weak limit cardinal. If the generalized continuum hypothesis holds, then a cardinal is strongly inaccessible if and only if it is weakly inaccessible.

 (aleph-null) is a regular strong limit cardinal. Assuming the axiom of choice, every other infinite cardinal number is regular or a (weak) limit. However, only a rather large cardinal number can be both and thus weakly inaccessible.

An ordinal is a weakly inaccessible cardinal if and only if it is a regular ordinal and it is a limit of regular ordinals. (Zero, one, and are regular ordinals, but not limits of regular ordinals.) A cardinal which is weakly inaccessible and also a strong limit cardinal is strongly inaccessible.

The assumption of the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal is sometimes applied in the form of the assumption that one can work inside a Grothendieck universe, the two ideas being intimately connected.

== Models and consistency ==
Suppose that formula_4 is a cardinal number. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC) implies that the formula_4th level of the Von Neumann universe formula_6 is a model of ZFC whenever formula_4 is strongly inaccessible. Furthermore, ZF implies that the Gödel universe formula_8 is a model of ZFC whenever formula_4 is weakly inaccessible. Thus, ZF together with &quot;there exists a weakly inaccessible cardinal&quot; implies that ZFC is consistent. Therefore, inaccessible cardinals are a type of large cardinal.

If formula_10 is a standard model of ZFC and formula_4 is an inaccessible in formula_10, then

# formula_6 is one of the intended models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory;
# formula_14 is one of the intended models of Mendelson&#x27;s version of Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory which excludes global choice, replacing limitation of size by replacement and ordinary choice;
# and formula_15 is one of the intended models of Morse–Kelley set theory. 

Here, formula_16 is the set of Δ0-definable subsets of &quot;X&quot; (see constructible universe). It is worth pointing out that the first claim can be weakened: formula_4 does not need to be inaccessible, or even a cardinal number, in order for to be a standard model of ZF (see below).

Suppose formula_10 is a model of ZFC. Either formula_10 contains no strong inaccessible or, taking formula_4 to be the smallest strong inaccessible in formula_10, formula_6 is a standard model of ZFC which contains no strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+&quot;there are no strong inaccessibles&quot;. Similarly, either contains no weak inaccessible or, taking formula_4 to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to any standard sub-model of formula_10, then formula_8 is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+&quot;there are no weak inaccessibles&quot;. This shows that ZFC cannot prove the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals.

The issue whether ZFC is consistent with the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is more subtle. The proof sketched in the previous paragraph that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + &quot;there is not an inaccessible cardinal&quot; can be formalized in ZFC. However, assuming that ZFC is consistent, no proof that the consistency of ZFC implies the consistency of ZFC + &quot;there is an inaccessible cardinal&quot; can be formalized in ZFC. This follows from Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem, which shows that if ZFC + &quot;there is an inaccessible cardinal&quot; is consistent, then it cannot prove its own consistency. Because ZFC + &quot;there is an inaccessible cardinal&quot; does prove the consistency of ZFC, if ZFC proved that its own consistency implies the consistency of ZFC + &quot;there is an inaccessible cardinal&quot; then this latter theory would be able to prove its own consistency, which is impossible if it is consistent.

There are arguments for the existence of inaccessible cardinals that cannot be formalized in ZFC. One such argument, presented by , is that the class of all ordinals of a particular model &quot;M&quot; of set theory would itself be an inaccessible cardinal if there was a larger model of set theory extending &quot;M&quot; and preserving powerset of elements of &quot;M&quot;.

==Existence of a proper class of inaccessibles==
There are many important axioms in set theory which assert the existence of a proper class of cardinals which satisfy a predicate of interest. In the case of inaccessibility, the corresponding axiom is the assertion that for every cardinal &quot;μ&quot;, there is an inaccessible cardinal which is strictly larger, . Thus, this axiom guarantees the existence of an infinite tower of inaccessible cardinals (and may occasionally be referred to as the inaccessible cardinal axiom). As is the case for the existence of any inaccessible cardinal, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is unprovable from the axioms of ZFC. Assuming ZFC, the inaccessible cardinal axiom is equivalent to the universe axiom of Grothendieck and Verdier: every set is contained in a Grothendieck universe. The axioms of ZFC along with the universe axiom (or equivalently the inaccessible cardinal axiom) are denoted ZFCU (not to be confused with ZFC with urelements). This axiomatic system is useful to prove for example that every category has an appropriate Yoneda embedding.

This is a relatively weak large cardinal axiom since it amounts to saying that ∞ is 1-inaccessible in the language of the next section, where ∞ denotes the least ordinal not in V, i.e. the class of all ordinals in your model.

== &quot;α&quot;-inaccessible cardinals and hyper-inaccessible cardinals ==
The term &quot;&quot;α&quot;-inaccessible cardinal&quot; is ambiguous and different authors use inequivalent definitions. One definition is that
a cardinal is called α&quot;-inaccessible, for any ordinal &quot;α&quot;, if is inaccessible and for every ordinal &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot;, the set of &quot;β&quot;-inaccessibles less than is unbounded in (and thus of cardinality , since is regular). In this case the 0-inaccessible cardinals are the same as strongly inaccessible cardinals. Another possible definition is that a cardinal is called α&quot;-weakly inaccessible if is regular and for every ordinal &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot;, the set of &quot;β&quot;-weakly inaccessibles less than is unbounded in κ. In this case the 0-weakly inaccessible cardinals are the regular cardinals and the 1-weakly inaccessible cardinals are the weakly inaccessible cardinals.

The &quot;α&quot;-inaccessible cardinals can also be described as fixed points of functions which count the lower inaccessibles. For example, denote by &quot;ψ&quot;0(&quot;λ&quot;) the &quot;λ&quot;th inaccessible cardinal, then the fixed points of &quot;ψ&quot;0 are the 1-inaccessible cardinals. Then letting &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;β&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) be the &quot;λ&quot;th &quot;β&quot;-inaccessible cardinal, the fixed points of &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;β&quot; are the (&quot;β&quot;+1)-inaccessible cardinals (the values &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;β&quot;+1(&quot;λ&quot;)). If &quot;α&quot; is a limit ordinal, an &quot;α&quot;-inaccessible is a fixed point of every &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;β&quot; for &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot; (the value &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;α&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) is the &quot;λ&quot;th such cardinal). This process of taking fixed points of functions generating successively larger cardinals is commonly encountered in the study of large cardinal numbers.

The term hyper-inaccessible is ambiguous and has at least three incompatible meanings. Many authors use it to mean a regular limit of strongly inaccessible cardinals (1-inaccessible). Other authors use it to mean that is -inaccessible. (It can never be -inaccessible.) It is occasionally used to mean Mahlo cardinal.

The term &quot;α&quot;-hyper-inaccessible is also ambiguous. Some authors use it to mean &quot;α&quot;-inaccessible. Other authors use the definition that
for any ordinal &quot;α&quot;, a cardinal is &quot;α&quot;-hyper-inaccessible if and only if is hyper-inaccessible and for every ordinal &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot;, the set of &quot;β&quot;-hyper-inaccessibles less than is unbounded in .

Hyper-hyper-inaccessible cardinals and so on can be defined in similar ways, and as usual this term is ambiguous.

Using &quot;weakly inaccessible&quot; instead of &quot;inaccessible&quot;, similar definitions can be made for &quot;weakly &quot;α&quot;-inaccessible&quot;, &quot;weakly hyper-inaccessible&quot;, and &quot;weakly &quot;α&quot;-hyper-inaccessible&quot;.

Mahlo cardinals are inaccessible, hyper-inaccessible, hyper-hyper-inaccessible, ... and so on.

== Two model-theoretic characterisations of inaccessibility ==
Firstly, a cardinal is inaccessible if and only if has the following reflection property: for all subsets formula_26, there exists formula_27 such that formula_28 is an elementary substructure of formula_29. (In fact, the set of such &quot;α&quot; is closed unbounded in .) Therefore, formula_4 is formula_31-indescribable for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. On the other hand, there is not necessarily an ordinal formula_32 such that formula_6, and if this holds, then formula_4 must be the formula_4th inaccessible cardinal.

It is provable in ZF that formula_10 has a somewhat weaker reflection property, where the substructure formula_28 is only required to be &#x27;elementary&#x27; with respect to a finite set of formulas. Ultimately, the reason for this weakening is that whereas the model-theoretic satisfaction relation can be defined, semantic truth itself (i.e. formula_38) cannot, due to Tarski&#x27;s theorem.

Secondly, under ZFC Zermelo&#x27;s categoricity theorem can be shown, which states that formula_4 is inaccessible if and only if formula_40 is a model of second order ZFC.

In this case, by the reflection property above, there exists formula_27 such that formula_42 is a standard model of (first order) ZFC. Hence, the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is a stronger hypothesis than the existence of a transitive model of ZFC.

Inaccessibility of formula_4 is a formula_44 property over formula_6, while a cardinal formula_46 being inaccessible (in some given model of formula_47 containing formula_46) is formula_49.

<text>Raymond Wilson (born 8 September 1968) is a Scottish singer and guitarist, vocalist in the post-grunge band Stiltskin and in Genesis from 1996 to 2000.

== Early career and Stiltskin ==
Before starting a band called Guaranteed Pure in the 1990s, which featured himself along with Paul Holmes (keyboards), Steve Wilson (guitars), John Haimes (bass) and Chris Cavanagh (drums)., he joined Edinburgh Band Strategy in 1987 recording and independently releasing a demo titled Second Move. Guaranteed Pure released an album called &quot;Swing Your Bag&quot;, the title track of which was included on a compilation album on the label of Fish entitled &quot;The Funny Farm Project : Outpatients &#x27;93&quot;. He then joined Stiltskin; they released one album, &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1994), and had a No. 1 UK hit in May 1994 with the single &quot;Inside&quot;.

== Genesis ==
Wilson joined Genesis as the band&#x27;s lead singer after Phil Collins officially announced his departure in March 1996. Genesis founder members Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford were handed a CD of the Stiltskin album &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; from Virgin Records executives. They were impressed with Wilson&#x27;s vocal abilities and had their manager, Tony Smith, contact him for an audition. Wilson was announced as the new lead singer of Genesis in June 1997. Their only album with Wilson, &quot;...Calling All Stations...&quot;, was released that September and became a top 10 worldwide hit, except for the U.S. where it reached No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The album was re-issued in 2007. Genesis toured Europe in winter 1997 spring 1998, but the American leg was cancelled due to low ticket sales. The band went on an extended hiatus after the critical failure of the album.

In May 2001, during an interview with Dave Negrin for website WorldofGenesis.com, Wilson said: They basically phoned me up and said, &quot;Ray, we&#x27;re not continuing.&quot; I&#x27;ve never really felt that I was out of the band as such; it&#x27;s just that the band doesn&#x27;t exist any more (laughs). When I heard that, it was just after the &quot;Cut&quot; tour, about a year and a half ago. I&#x27;ve read some articles saying that I was fired and stuff, but to be fair to them, they didn&#x27;t phone me up and say, &quot;Ray, you&#x27;re fired. We&#x27;re going to carry on and we&#x27;re going to get somebody else to sing.&quot; Or, &quot;We&#x27;re going to carry on and get Phil back.&quot; There was never any of that. They just said, &quot;We&#x27;ve decided not to continue because the market doesn&#x27;t want us.&quot; I think they didn&#x27;t want to completely close the door to ever doing anything again.

== Solo career ==

In 1999, Wilson released the album &quot;Millionairhead&quot; with a solo project called Cut_. It was remastered in 2007 with three additional songs added.

In 2003, he released a solo album under his own name entitled &quot;Change&quot;. The next year, he released another studio album entitled &quot;The Next Best Thing&quot;, which included a new version of the Stiltskin hit &quot;Inside&quot;. In 2006, he released another Stiltskin album called &quot;She&quot;, and in 2007 a Stiltskin live CD featuring (amongst others) 8 of the 12 songs from &quot;She&quot;. This live CD was recorded 25 October 2006, at Harmonie, Bonn, Germany.

DJ and trance producer Armin van Buuren has produced remixes of the songs &quot;Another Day&quot; (retitled &quot;Yet Another Day&quot;) and &quot;Gypsy&quot; from &quot;Millionairhead&quot;. Both remixes have been respectively released on van Buuren&#x27;s own albums &quot;76&quot; and &quot;Shivers&quot;, and &quot;Yet Another Day&quot; was also released as a single.

In 2014, the first Ray Wilson biography, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno).

In June 2016, his new solo album &quot;Song for a Friend&quot; was released, which included ten unreleased acoustic tracks with a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;High Hopes.&quot; The original idea for the album title was &quot;Backseat Drivers&quot;. It was to be a double album. Wilson wanted to have one CD with acoustic music and a second CD with electric music. He then decided to split the two. In an interview he explained the decision was taken because the acoustic version of &quot;Song for a Friend&quot; would not have got the attention it deserves. The second disc (the electric and rockier collection of new songs) was later released in September of the same year as a stand-alone new album called &quot;Makes Me Think of Home&quot;.

On 7 and 8 September 2018, Wilson gave two exclusive concerts in Poznań at Zamek Culture Centre to celebrate his 50th birthday. Those two special nights titled &quot;50th Celebration Birthday Concerts&quot; saw Wilson performing only Genesis (and band members) material during the first night, while his solo material from his various projects (solo, Stiltskin and Cut_) on the second date. This was the first time he played a full concert without any Genesis songs since his tenure with the band.

== Concerts with Steve Hackett ==
In 2013, Wilson joined Steve Hackett for the latter&#x27;s Genesis Revisited II Tour as a guest singer. He was featured in a special edition of the &quot;Genesis Revisited II&quot; album on the track &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot;. It was the first time since 1998 that Wilson had worked with a fellow Genesis member, albeit one he had not performed with as a member of the band.

== Personal life ==
Wilson is the cousin of Ian Wilson, better known as Ian Catskilkin, of the UK indie band, Art Brut.

Ray met his future wife Tyla Holmes in 2000 (she is the sister of Paul Holmes, the keyboard player in Wilson&#x27;s then-band Guaranteed Pure). They started dating, and married in 2002. She began working as his assistant, and then tour manager. They separated at the end of 2006 but remained good friends, with Tyla keeping her managerial role even after the ending of their relationship. She later left the music industry and concentrated on a career as a personal trainer in Australia.

In 2007, after a concert in Poland, Wilson met the dancer Małgorzata Mielech, also known as Gosia. After a few months of dating, he left Edinburgh and moved to Poznań in September 2008. To celebrate their lasting love, in 2016 Ray wrote a song for Gosia entitled &quot;Not Long &#x27;Til Springtime&quot;: she appeared as main actor in the official video of the song. As of 2018, the couple were engaged. Despite Wilson being reluctant to show and talk about his personal life, he and Gosia gave a major interview with an exclusive photoshoot showing the duo together for the famous Polish magazine &quot;Pani&quot; in August 2018.
He married singer and songwriter Marika Jasek in October 2024 during a private ceremony.

<doc id="248078" wikidata="Q281892" url="?curid=248078" title="Stingray (1964 TV series)">
<text>Stingray is a British children&#x27;s science fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and produced by AP Films (APF) for ITC Entertainment. Filmed in 1963 using a combination of electronic marionette puppetry and scale model special effects, it was APF&#x27;s sixth puppet series and the third to be produced under the banner of &quot;Supermarionation&quot;. It premiered in October 1964 and ran for 39 half-hour episodes.

Set in the 2060s, the series follows the exploits of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), an organisation responsible for policing the Earth&#x27;s oceans. The WASP&#x27;s flagship is &quot;Stingray&quot;, a combat submarine crewed by Captain Troy Tempest, navigator Lieutenant &quot;Phones&quot; and Marina, a mute young woman from under the sea. &quot;Stingray&quot;″s adventures bring it into contact with various underwater civilisations, some friendly and others hostile, as well as strange natural phenomena.

In preparation for the series, APF moved to larger studios that it would continue to occupy for the remainder of the 1960s. Filmed on a budget of £1 million, &quot;Stingray&quot; was the first British TV series to be made entirely in colour, a move intended to increase its appeal to the lucrative American market. The underwater sequences were filmed &quot;dry&quot; by shooting the sets through thin aquaria, while surface shots were filmed on water tanks incorporating lowered back walls to create artificial horizons. &quot;Stingray&quot; was the first Supermarionation series whose puppet characters had interchangeable heads showing a range of facial expressions.

&quot;Stingray&quot; was originally broadcast on the ITV network in the United Kingdom and in syndication in North America. The series has drawn a largely positive response from commentators, some of whom have compared its premise to the Cold War.

==Premise==
&quot;Stingray&quot;, a nuclear-powered combat submarine, is the flagship of the World Aquanaut Security Patrol (WASP), a branch of the World Security Patrol (WSP) responsible for policing the Earth&#x27;s oceans in the mid-2060s. Armed with &quot;sting missile&quot; torpedoes, it can travel at up to underwater and reach depths of over .

The WASP is based in the self-contained city of Marineville, located several miles inland somewhere on the West Coast of North America. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean via a tunnel leading to an &quot;ocean door&quot;, through which &quot;Stingray&quot; is launched. General quarters alerts are sounded by rapid drumbeats played over the base&#x27;s public address system. In emergency situations, the entire base can be lowered into underground bunkers via giant hydraulic jacks while fighter aircraft and interceptor missiles are launched to counter threats. WASP personnel acknowledge commands with the phrase &quot;P.W.O.R.&quot; – short for &quot;Proceeding With Orders Received&quot;.

&quot;Stingray&quot; is piloted by the square-jawed Captain Troy Tempest. He is paired with Southern navigator Lieutenant George Lee Sheridan, nicknamed &quot;Phones&quot; for his secondary role as &quot;Stingray&quot;″s hydrophone operator. Troy and Phones board &quot;Stingray&quot; from the Marineville stand-by lounge by sitting on twin seats that are then lowered into the submarine via injector tubes. They answer to the &quot;hoverchair&quot;-bound Commander Sam Shore, whose daughter, Lieutenant Atlanta Shore, works in the Marineville control tower and is enamoured of Troy.

The series begins with the WASP&#x27;s discovery that the ocean floor is home to many advanced civilisations. Among these is the undersea city of Titanica, ruled by King Titan. A despot, Titan commands the Aquaphibians, a warrior race who possess a fleet of lethal submersibles called &quot;Mechanical Fish&quot;. In the first episode, &quot;Stingray&quot; is attacked by Titan&#x27;s forces and Troy and Phones are captured. They are rescued by Titan&#x27;s slave, Marina, a mute young woman from the undersea city of Pacifica who can breathe underwater. Marina defects to the WASP and becomes a permanent member of the &quot;Stingray&quot; crew. Troy becomes infatuated with her, making Atlanta jealous.

Furious at Marina&#x27;s betrayal, Titan swears revenge on &quot;terraneans&quot; (land people) in general and Troy and the WASP in particular. However, his attempts to destroy &quot;Stingray&quot; and Marineville are always thwarted, often due to the incompetence of his henchman Surface Agent X-2-Zero. Titan&#x27;s spy on land, X-2-Zero operates from the Pacific island of Lemoy, where he lives in an outwardly dilapidated house whose interior conceals vast banks of sophisticated surveillance and tracking equipment. Some episodes revolve around encounters with other races living under the sea or within the Earth (some friendly and others hostile), or investigation of natural phenomena. The final episode is a clip show in which Troy is named &quot;Aquanaut of the Year&quot; and past missions are recounted in flashback.

==Characters==
===WASP and allies===
* Captain Troy Tempest (voiced by Don Mason): pilot of the WASP&#x27;s flagship submarine, &quot;Stingray&quot;.
* &quot;Phones&quot; (voiced by Robert Easton): a WASP lieutenant, &quot;Stingray&quot;″s navigator and hydrophone operator, and Troy&#x27;s best friend. His real name, George Lee Sheridan, is mentioned in the series&#x27; publicity material but never spoken on-screen.
* Marina: a young woman from under the sea who joins the &quot;Stingray&quot; crew. She was enslaved by King Titan of Titanica but defects to the WASP in the first episode and quickly becomes Troy&#x27;s love interest. She can breathe in or out of water and is mute like the rest of her race.
* Commander Samuel Shore (voiced by Ray Barrett): head of Marineville. Paralysed from the waist down, he uses a hoverchair to move about. The cause of his disability is revealed in the episode &quot;The Ghost of the Sea&quot;: as a security agent for an ocean mining platform, he was injured when the facility was attacked by a hostile submersible.
* Lieutenant Atlanta Shore (voiced by Lois Maxwell): Commander Shore&#x27;s daughter, the assistant controller in Marineville Tower and Marina&#x27;s rival for Troy&#x27;s affections.
* Sub-Lieutenant John Horatio Fisher (voiced by Ray Barrett): the junior assistant controller in Marineville Tower. In the episode &quot;Rescue from the Skies&quot; he is seen training to be an aquanaut.
* WSP Commanders (voiced by Don Mason, Ray Barrett, Robert Easton and David Graham): three commanders based at WSP Headquarters in Washington, D.C. They appear in various episodes to brief Commander Shore and other WASP personnel.
* Admiral Jack Denver (voiced by David Graham): the president of the WASP&#x27;s underwater research division. He went to college with Commander Shore and enjoys debating with him.
* &quot;Doc&quot; (voiced by David Graham): Marineville&#x27;s doctor. He appears in the episodes &quot;The Master Plan&quot; and &quot;Invisible Enemy&quot;.
* Aphony: Marina&#x27;s father, ruler of the peaceful underwater city of Pacifica. He appears in the episodes &quot;Plant of Doom&quot; and &quot;Tune of Danger&quot;.
* Oink (voiced by David Graham): a seal pup that becomes Marina&#x27;s pet after he saves the &quot;Stingray&quot; crew from a bomb in the episode &quot;Sea of Oil&quot;.

===Recurring villains===
* King Titan (voiced by Ray Barrett): the tyrannical ruler of the underwater city of Titanica who wages war on the WASP.
* Surface Agent X-2-Zero (voiced by Robert Easton): Titan&#x27;s inept agent on land, based in a dilapidated house on the Pacific island of Lemoy.
* The Aquaphibians (voiced by Robert Easton and David Graham): a race of undersea warriors who serve Titan. Their language resembles a series of gurgles.
* Teufel: Titan&#x27;s pet, a large fish with supernatural powers that Titan keeps in a tank in his throne room and worships as a god.
* El Hudat and Abu (voiced by David Graham and Ray Barrett) : the dictator of the island state of Hudatvia and his aide. They appear in the episodes &quot;Star of the East&quot; and &quot;Eastern Eclipse&quot;.
* Grupa and Noctus (voiced by Ray Barrett and David Graham): a pair of undersea beings who appear in the episodes &quot;A Nut for Marineville&quot; and &quot;Trapped in the Depths&quot;.

==Episodes==
Episodes are listed in the order of original broadcast in the ATV London region.

===Special episodes===
APF subsequently used the framing material from the abandoned clip show to create a TV film called the &quot;Feature Presentation&quot;. Written and directed by Alan Pattillo, this comprises four complete episodes and was privately screened for Japanese TV executives visiting the APF studio. It has never been broadcast on TV.

The framing material was rediscovered in late 2000 or early 2001 and later included on &quot;Stingray&quot; DVD releases. Several years later, BBC Wales and Granada International produced a condensed version of the Feature Presentation titled &quot;The Reunion Party&quot;, which includes material from three episodes and was broadcast on BBC Four as part of a &quot;Gerry Anderson Night&quot; in 2008.

===Compilation films===
In the early 1980s, two &quot;Stingray&quot; compilation films were produced by ITC New York. These were made for American TV and later released on home video. They were televised as part of an ITC package branded &quot;Super Space Theater&quot;, which also included compilations from other Supermarionation series. Each of the &quot;Stingray&quot; films consists of re-edited versions of four of the original episodes. The second film, &quot;Invaders from the Deep&quot;, was broadcast as the first episode of movie-mocking TV comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in 1988.

==Production==
In late 1962, as production on &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; drew to a close, Gerry Anderson decided that an underwater series was the next logical step for APF: &quot;We had been on land and in space, so where could we go next? One possibility was underwater.&quot; He was inspired by childhood memories of U-boats in the Second World War, as well as by the mysteries of the ocean: &quot;I was ... fascinated by trenches in the ocean that are as deep as mountains are high. There are features that man has never seen and pressures that are almost impossible to withstand. I began to wonder if there were areas of the Earth which had been little explored and felt justified in writing some wacky stuff.&quot;

APF&#x27;s financial backer Lew Grade, who had bought the company after the success of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, approved the concept and commissioned 26 episodes. Anderson named the new series &quot;Stingray&quot; partly from a belief that stingrays are dangerous animals (in reality, they are docile), but also because it &quot;seemed an exciting title.&quot; In preparation for the new series, APF, then based on the Slough Trading Estate&#x27;s Ipswich Road, moved to a larger site on the nearby Stirling Road at a cost of £75,000. The new studios, built inside a converted factory unit, contained three shooting stages: two for puppet filming and one for creating special effects. This arrangement allowed two episodes to be filmed simultaneously by separate crews.

Production began in spring or June 1963 and the series was completed in ten months. Each episode required an average of 11 days of puppet filming and five-and-a-half days of effects filming. The total cost of the production was approximately £1 million (£ million in ). The budget per episode was £20,000, which enabled APF, whose earlier productions had been in black and white, to film in Eastmancolor. Though &quot;Stingray&quot; would debut in black and white in its country of origin, the switch to colour filming was intended to increase the series&#x27; chances of being bought by a network in the US, where colour TV was already common. Sets were re-painted after NBC supplied APF with a list of colours believed to cause problems such as flaring or bleeding; according to Anderson, this was unnecessary because in Eastmancolor, a set &quot;would appear on screen exactly as you had painted it.&quot; Some colours were avoided as they did not come out well in black and white, and models and sets were painted differently to ensure that they did not blend into each other. During the production of &quot;Stingray&quot;, APF became the UK&#x27;s largest colour film consumer.

As filming progressed, Grade extended the series to 39 episodes. Around the time shooting on the final 13 episodes began, Don Mason and Robert Easton, who had understood that all of the voice cast were on the same pay, learnt that they were actually earning less than their co-star David Graham. They did not commit to the remaining episodes until they had re-negotiated their fees.

In a first for a Supermarionation series, &quot;Stingray&quot; included a Christmas episode, &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot;, and a clip show series finale, &quot;Aquanaut of the Year&quot;. Before it could make the latter, APF required the approval of American TV producer Ralph Edwards, as the premise of the clip show borrowed creative elements from Edwards&#x27; &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. When correspondence with Edwards took longer than expected, work began on an alternative clip show in which the regular characters watch film recordings of some of &quot;Stingray&quot;″s past missions. The filming of that episode was halted when APF was given permission to proceed with &quot;Aquanaut of the Year&quot;.

===Characters and puppet design===
In her 2007 autobiography, Sylvia Anderson, who had voiced the regular characters of Jimmy Gibson in &quot;Supercar&quot; and Dr Venus in &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, wrote that she devised Marina as a mute so that she could take a break from voice acting and &quot;concentrate on the scripts and characters&quot;. Her voice parts in &quot;Stingray&quot; were limited to uncredited guest roles in the episodes &quot;Raptures of the Deep&quot; (as Marina) and &quot;A Christmas to Remember&quot;. Gerry Anderson said that Phones was inspired by memories of a sound engineer with whom he had once worked: &quot;He spent so long with his headphones plugged in to various bits of equipment that he used to leave them on all the time, earning himself the nickname &#x27;Phones&#x27;.&quot; Voice actor Robert Easton based the character&#x27;s Southern American tones on his performance in the 1961 film &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, in which he played a Southern radio operator. His voice for Surface Agent X-2-Zero was his impression of Peter Lorre, who had appeared in the same film. The Aquaphibians were voiced by Easton and Graham, their dialogue overlaid with a looped tape recording of bubbling water to create a gurgling effect.

The process of designing and making the puppets took four months and each of the main characters was sculpted in duplicate to allow episodes to be filmed in pairs. Some of the main characters were modelled on real-life actors; for example, Troy Tempest drew heavily on the looks of James Garner. Gerry Anderson said that he did not explicitly instruct the sculptors to base Troy on this actor; instead, he named Garner simply to help them visualise the character, as he could see that they were struggling with his original brief (which merely called for Troy to be square-jawed and heroic-looking). Titan was based on a young Laurence Olivier, and Surface Agent X-2-Zero on either Claude Rains or Peter Lorre. Atlanta Shore has been likened to Lois Maxwell (who voiced the character), while Marina has drawn comparisons to both Ursula Andress and Brigitte Bardot. The Aquaphibians were modelled on an alien creature from the &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; episode &quot;XL5 to H2O&quot;.

&quot;Stingray&quot; was the first Supermarionation series to feature puppets with glass eyes and poseable hands for increased realism. To make the puppets&#x27; eyes sparkle in a lifelike way, they were polished with silicon and illuminated by a small lamp. Another innovation was the creation of alternative heads to allow characters to display emotions: besides their &quot;normal&quot; heads, which had neutral expressions, the main characters could also be fitted with &quot;smiling&quot; and &quot;frowning&quot; heads. The female puppets&#x27; wigs were made of human hair; for the male puppets, mohair was used as it was softer and easier to style.

===Effects design===
The &quot;Stingray&quot; submarine was designed by Reg Hill and built by Feltham-based company Mastermodels. The Marineville model was built in-house from wood and cardboard supplemented with pieces of model kits bought from a toy shop. It was lowered and raised using hydraulics. Most of the series&#x27; special effects were filmed on high-speed cameras with the footage slowed down in post-production to convey a sense of greater weight and scale.

For the underwater sequences, Anderson had originally envisaged filming inside a water tank, but the cost of the specialist cameras and equipment required would have made this impractical. These scenes were ultimately filmed using a variation of a technique first used on &quot;Supercar&quot;: mounting a model ocean floor against a cyclorama and &quot;flying&quot; the puppets and miniature models across the set on wires from an overhead gantry, while shooting the action through a thin aquarium to distort the lighting. Vegetable dye was added to the aquarium to make the water more noticeable. Several aquaria were used; constructed by a company that supplied fish tanks to London Zoo, they were re-built with thicker glass after one of them burst from the water pressure. The move away from black and white sometimes caused problems as build-ups of algae in the aquaria caused the water to change colour.

The illusion of scenes being set underwater was further enhanced by populating the aquaria with tropical fish of various sizes to create forced perspective. Food was dropped at various points around the tanks to keep the animals in shot. A disc with various portions cut out was placed in front of an overhead lamp and rotated to give the impression of light being refracted through the ocean, while the water in the aquaria was disturbed to create &quot;rippling&quot; effects. Wires were painted over to make them non-reflective and fans were used to simulate currents passing over puppets&#x27; hair and clothing. For the climax of the &quot;Stingray&quot; launch sequence, in which the vessel shoots out of an underwater tunnel, part of the set was painted onto the aquarium to conceal the air line that produced the accompanying rush of bubbles.

Ocean surface shots in &quot;Supercar&quot; and &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; had been filmed in an outdoor tank, but for &quot;Stingray&quot; several tanks were built inside the studio. Among the challenges presented by these shots was the need to make the scale models appear realistic while filming on water, which cannot be miniaturised. In a 1980 interview, Derek Meddings, the series&#x27; special effects director, described the process as &quot;designing the shot carefully [...] then shoot[ing] it at very high speed (to make movement slower and therefore seemingly vaster) and hope you didn&#x27;t get huge globules of water that would give the game away.&quot; Models were controlled using wires, poles and underwater tracks and rigs. To make the water look blue, the crew first tried experimenting with various lighting effects; these proved inadequate, so the water was dyed blue instead. Various powders were used to create foam and whitewater.

Each tank incorporated an artificial horizon system whereby the back wall was built low and the tank was deliberately overfilled to create a waterfall, blurring the divide between the rim of the tank and the painted-sky backdrop. The effect was sustained by collecting the escaping water in troughs and pumping it back into the tank. To conserve studio space, some scenes were filmed in a wedge-shaped tank that was tailor-built to align with the camera&#x27;s field of view. One of the effects shots in the series&#x27; opening titles shows &quot;Stingray&quot; and a pursuing Mechanical Fish leaping out of the ocean and then plunging back under water; although this required complex manoeuvres from the wired scale models, making the shot extremely difficult to film, the crew succeeded on the first take.

Shots of aircraft in flight were filmed using a technique known as the &quot;rolling sky&quot;, whereby the miniature models were positioned in front of a painted-sky canvas and remained static while an illusion of movement was created by running the background in a continuous loop around a pair of electrically driven rollers. This system, devised by Meddings, made aerial shots easier to film as it took up very little studio space.

===Opening and closing titles===
The title sequence consists of a series of action shots featuring undersea explosions, Marineville going to red alert and &quot;Stingray&quot; doing battle with a Mechanical Fish. This is accompanied by dramatic narration from Commander Shore, who warns the audience to &quot;Stand by for action!&quot; before declaring that &quot;Anything can happen in the next half-hour!&quot; In the first 26 episodes, the title sequence opens in black and white before switching to colour; for the final 13 episodes, these first few seconds were replaced with all-colour footage.

Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, authors of &quot;Collins Telly Guide&quot;, praise the introduction, writing that &quot;Of all the programmes we&#x27;ve looked at for this book, there is none with a title sequence as thrilling as &quot;Stingray&quot;.&quot; Anthony Clark of the British Film Institute calls the sequence &quot;a mini-adventure in itself ... Children&#x27;s TV had never before been this exciting.&quot; According to John Peel, the &quot;Stingray&quot; titles contrasted greatly with those of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; and &quot;Supercar&quot;, which were more &quot;straight narrative openings&quot;. Peel also argues that &quot;Stingray&quot; influenced the &quot;rapid cutting, pounding rhythms and extreme stylising&quot; of later TV title sequences.

The series&#x27; closing titles focus on the love triangle between Troy, Marina and Atlanta. They feature Troy singing &quot;Aqua Marina&quot; – a ballad about his love of Marina, performed by Gary Miller with soprano backing vocals – while Atlanta gazes wistfully at his photograph.

==Broadcast and reception==
In the UK, &quot;Stingray&quot; was first broadcast on 4 October 1964 in the Anglia, Border, Grampian, London and Southern regions. It premiered on Channel Television, ATV Midlands and Westward Television on 6 October and Granada Television on 30 December. First shown in black and white, it was broadcast in colour for the first time in December 1969. The series received little publicity but replicated the success of earlier Supermarionation productions. It was repeated on ITV in 1981 and on BBC2 in the early 1990s, with further repeats in the early 00s.

In the US, the series was first shown in 1965. Premiering in colour, it was syndicated across more than 100 markets with sales exceeding £3 million. It ran on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1994 as part of the Cartoon Quest block.

===Critical response===
Writing in 2006, Robert Sellers described &quot;Stingray&quot; as the &quot;first truly classic Anderson show&quot;, whose special effects &quot;have stood the test of time remarkably well.&quot; Daniel O&#x27;Brien, author of &quot;SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World&quot;, considers it to be &quot;perhaps the archetypal Gerry Anderson series&quot;. Ranking the Anderson productions, Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy places &quot;Stingray&quot; fourth, calling it &quot;a kids&#x27; adventure serial of the highest order&quot;. Andrew Blair of Den of Geek believes that when grouped with &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; and &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot; is &quot;the lesser of the Holy Triumvirate of Supermarionation [...] It&#x27;s shorter than the former, and lighter than the latter, giving it a comparatively breezy feel.&quot; He also describes it as &quot;inherently a matinee adventure, an inspiring rush of mild peril and jaunty escapades&quot;.

Comparing &quot;Stingray&quot; to the Andersons&#x27; earlier productions, media historian Marcus Hearn writes that the series essentially &quot;[transfers] the format of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; to an underwater setting.&quot; Peel suggests that the decision to locate the action under the sea was influenced by the 1960s vogue for ocean exploration inspired by adventurers such as Jacques Cousteau and Thor Heyerdahl. Kim Newman describes &quot;Stingray&quot; as a &quot;patrol show&quot; in the same vein as &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; and &quot;Supercar&quot;. Clark notes that &quot;Stingray&quot;, like its space-bound precursor, uses &quot;some very simple elements – a four-square hero, a fantastic craft which lends its name to the show and a mix of fast-paced action and innocent humour.&quot; Despite praising &quot;Stingray&quot;, Peel considers &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; to be more appealing. Peel also argues that of all Gerry Anderson&#x27;s series, it is &quot;Stingray&quot; in which his preferred &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot; style of humour is most prominent.

Mike Fillis of &quot;TV Zone&quot; magazine regards &quot;Stingray&quot; as less &quot;ambitious&quot; than &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; but compares its &quot;self-awareness&quot; favourably to the &quot;po-faced rigidity&quot; of &quot;Captain Scarlet&quot;. He also praises its &quot;well-drawn&quot; characters and describes the water-based special effects as &quot;surprisingly elegant&quot;. Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, authors of &quot;The Guinness Book of Classic British TV&quot;, view the effects as more &quot;realistic&quot; than those of earlier Anderson series. Though judging many of the episodes to be &quot;predictable and corny&quot;, they add that the series&#x27; &quot;knowingness&quot; and &quot;love of character [...] made the whole thing charming.&quot; Sangster and Condon describe the episodes as &quot;mercifully shorter&quot; than those of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, creating &quot;tighter plotting and an engaging simplicity&quot;. The music has also been praised: Glenn Erickson describes it as &quot;corny retro&quot; appropriate to the series&#x27; tone, while Clark calls it the &quot;best underwater adventure music ever written&quot;.

Some commentators have been critical of the puppetry and effects. Paul Mavis of DVD Talk writes that the use of aquaria makes the underwater scenes look &quot;a tad creaky&quot; but believes that they compare well to contemporary feature film effects. Erickson writes that as in other Supermarionation series, the puppets&#x27; lack of mobility makes scenes feel &quot;rather static&quot;. He notes that this limitation forces a large amount of movement to be kept off-screen: &quot;Almost every capture by Aquaphibians ellipses difficult-to-film interaction, skipping straight to static talking scenes instead.&quot;

Sangster and Condon argue that, while &quot;Stingray&quot; is mainly for children, it was also the first Anderson series to have adult appeal. According to Jon E. Lewis and Penny Stempel, authors of &quot;Cult TV: The Essential Critical Guide&quot;, the series combines &quot;kiddie-time exciting narrative action&quot; with imaginative spoofs for the &quot;more sophisticated&quot;. &quot;Stingray&quot; has also attracted a variety of comment on its presentation of race and sex. Newman argues that through its use of &quot;silver- and green-skinned&quot; undersea villains and the &quot;odd caricatured Arab baddie&quot;, &quot;Stingray&quot;, like &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, conveys &quot;square, almost 1950s&quot; attitudes towards race. Mavis rejects claims of racism, noting that not all of the series&#x27; underwater beings are malevolent and that this is acknowledged in character dialogue. Nicholas J. Cull views the mute Marina as an example of a female Anderson character who is &quot;subordinate&quot; to men, while Erickson argues that Atlanta&#x27;s role as an assistant makes her a gender stereotype. Erickson also writes that the love triangle between Atlanta, Troy and Marina (which Blair describes as an &quot;unusual development&quot; for a children&#x27;s series) creates a &quot;mild sexist tension&quot;. Mavis disagrees that the series is sexist, noting that while Atlanta &quot;doesn&#x27;t do much here except answer the phone&quot;, Marina saves Troy&#x27;s life on several occasions.

====Cold War analysis====
Cull observes that in its depiction of the WASP, &quot;Stingray&quot; is one of several Gerry Anderson series that &quot;assume the development of world government and world security institutions&quot; and &quot;reflect the 1960s vogue for stories set in secret organisations with extravagant acronyms.&quot; He compares the premise of the series to the Cold War, noting the conflict between the WASP and the undersea races and the latter&#x27;s use of spies to infiltrate human society. He believes that the episode &quot;Marineville Traitor&quot;, which focuses on a hunt for an &quot;enemy within&quot;, has an &quot;especially strong Cold War flavour&quot;. Cull also notes that while the Anderson productions often present nuclear technology as a threat, &quot;Stingray&quot; also shows it in a positive light: for example, the series&#x27; eponymous submarine is nuclear-powered.

Sarah Kurchak of The A.V. Club suggests that compared to villains of earlier Anderson series, Titan and the Aquaphibians serve as a &quot;more classically Cold War-style villainous Other&quot;. She adds that in the world of &quot;Stingray&quot;, &quot;the battle lines between land and sea are clearly defined, the enemy is always watching, and the target of their aggression is always close to home.&quot; Kurchak also suggests that through his &quot;multiple nightmares&quot; about threats to Marineville, Troy embodies Cold War anxieties. O&#x27;Brien writes that &quot;Stingray&quot; contains &quot;more than a touch of the Cold War ethos&quot;, arguing that Titan &quot;could have easily belonged to an underwater branch of the Soviet Bloc.&quot;

==Tie-ins==
&quot;Stingray&quot; was featured in the Supermarionation tie-in comic &quot;TV Century 21&quot; (later known as &quot;TV21&quot;) from its first issue, published by City Magazines/AP Films (Merchandising) in January 1965. The &quot;Stingray&quot; strip ran from &quot;TV Century 21&quot; issue 1 (23 January 1965) to &quot;TV21&quot; issue 189 (30 August 1968). It was originally by Alan Fennell and Ron Embleton; later contributors included Dennis Hooper, Gerry Embleton, and Michael Strand. The &quot;Stingray&quot; comics were reprinted in Polystyle Publications&#x27; &quot;Countdown&quot; in 1971 and 1972.

The 1960s also saw the publication of two original novels by Armada Books: &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Stingray and the Monster&quot;, written by John William Jennison under the pseudonym &quot;John Theydon&quot;.

===Audio plays===
To supplement the TV episodes, in 1965 APF&#x27;s sister company Century 21 Records released three audio plays in the form of 7-inch vinyl EP records. Originally marketed as &quot;mini-albums&quot;, these feature the voice cast from the TV series and are each about 21 minutes long. They are included as special features on the UK &quot;Stingray&quot; DVD box set.

Anderson Entertainment, in association with Big Finish Productions, later produced audio adaptations of the original novels &quot;Stingray&quot; and &quot;Stingray and the Monster&quot;, titled &quot;Operation Icecap&quot; and &quot;Monster from the Deep&quot; respectively.

<text>In mathematics, a Mahlo cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. Mahlo cardinals were first described by . As with all large cardinals, none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proven to exist by ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent).

A cardinal number formula_1 is called strongly Mahlo if formula_1 is strongly inaccessible and the set formula_3 is stationary in formula_1. In other words, formula_1 is strongly inaccessible, and for any unbounded set formula_6 of cardinals, there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal formula_7 which is a limit of members of formula_8.

A cardinal formula_1 is called weakly Mahlo if formula_1 is weakly inaccessible and the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than formula_1 is stationary in formula_1.

The term &quot;Mahlo cardinal&quot; now usually means &quot;strongly Mahlo cardinal&quot;, though the cardinals originally considered by Mahlo were weakly Mahlo cardinals.

== Minimal condition sufficient for a Mahlo cardinal ==

* If κ is a limit &quot;ordinal&quot; and the set of regular ordinals less than κ is stationary in κ, then κ is weakly Mahlo.

The main difficulty in proving this is to show that κ is regular. We will suppose that it is not regular and construct a club set which gives us a μ such that: 
:μ = cf(μ) &lt; cf(κ) &lt; μ &lt; κ which is a contradiction.
If κ were not regular, then cf(κ) &lt; κ. We could choose a strictly increasing and continuous cf(κ)-sequence which begins with cf(κ)+1 and has κ as its limit. The limits of that sequence would be club in κ. So there must be a regular μ among those limits. So μ is a limit of an initial subsequence of the cf(κ)-sequence. Thus its cofinality is less than the cofinality of κ and greater than it at the same time; which is a contradiction. Thus the assumption that κ is not regular must be false, i.e. κ is regular.

No stationary set can exist below formula_13 with the required property because {2,3,4...} is club in ω but contains no regular ordinals; so κ is uncountable. And it is a regular limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible. Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below κ as a club set to show that the stationary set may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles.

*If κ is weakly Mahlo and also a strong limit, then κ is Mahlo.

κ is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible.

We show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below κ is club in κ. Let μ0 be the larger of the threshold and ω1. For each finite n, let μn+1 = 2μn which is less than κ because it is a strong limit cardinal. Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than κ by its regularity. The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals. So the set of them is club in κ. Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than κ.

== Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals κ are κ-inaccessible (hyper-inaccessible)==

The term &quot;hyper-inaccessible&quot; is ambiguous. In this section, a cardinal κ is called hyper-inaccessible if it is κ-inaccessible (as opposed to the more common meaning of 1-inaccessible).

Suppose κ is Mahlo. We proceed by transfinite induction on α to show that κ is α-inaccessible for any α ≤ κ. Since κ is Mahlo, κ is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing.

If κ is α-inaccessible, then there are β-inaccessibles (for β &lt; α) arbitrarily close to κ. Consider the set of simultaneous limits of such β-inaccessibles larger than some threshold but less than κ. It is unbounded in κ (imagine rotating through β-inaccessibles for β &lt; α ω-times choosing a larger cardinal each time, then take the limit which is less than κ by regularity (this is what fails if α ≥ κ)). It is closed, so it is club in κ. So, by κ&#x27;s Mahlo-ness, it contains an inaccessible. That inaccessible is actually an α-inaccessible. So κ is α+1-inaccessible.

If λ ≤ κ is a limit ordinal and κ is α-inaccessible for all α &lt; λ, then every β &lt; λ is also less than α for some α &lt; λ. So this case is trivial. In particular, κ is κ-inaccessible and thus hyper-inaccessible.

To show that κ is a limit of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need to show that the diagonal set of cardinals μ &lt; κ which are α-inaccessible for every α &lt; μ is club in κ. Choose a 0-inaccessible above the threshold, call it α0. Then pick an α0-inaccessible, call it α1. Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it μ. Then μ has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of α-inaccessibles for all α &lt; μ) and is less than κ by regularity. Limits of such cardinals also have the property, so the set of them is club in κ. By Mahlo-ness of κ, there is an inaccessible in this set and it is hyper-inaccessible. So κ is 1-hyper-inaccessible. We can intersect this same club set with the stationary set less than κ to get a stationary set of hyper-inaccessibles less than κ.

The rest of the proof that κ is α-hyper-inaccessible mimics the proof that it is α-inaccessible. So κ is hyper-hyper-inaccessible, etc..

== α-Mahlo, hyper-Mahlo and greatly Mahlo cardinals ==

The term α-Mahlo is ambiguous and different authors give inequivalent definitions. One definition is that 
a cardinal κ is called α-Mahlo for some ordinal α if κ is strongly inaccessible and for every ordinal β&lt;α, the set of β-Mahlo cardinals below κ is stationary in κ.p. 3 However the condition &quot;κ is strongly inaccessible&quot; is sometimes replaced by other conditions, such as &quot;κ is regular&quot; or &quot;κ is weakly inaccessible&quot; or &quot;κ is Mahlo&quot;. We can define &quot;hyper-Mahlo&quot;, &quot;α-hyper-Mahlo&quot;, &quot;hyper-hyper-Mahlo&quot;, &quot;weakly α-Mahlo&quot;, &quot;weakly hyper-Mahlo&quot;, &quot;weakly α-hyper-Mahlo&quot;, and so on, by analogy with the definitions for inaccessibles, so for example a cardinal κ is called hyper-Mahlo if it is κ-Mahlo.

A regular uncountable cardinal κ is greatly Mahlo if and only if there is a normal (i.e. nontrivial and closed under diagonal intersections) κ-complete filter on the power set of κ that is closed under the Mahlo operation, which maps the set of ordinals &quot;S&quot; to {αformula_14&quot;S&quot;: α has uncountable cofinality and S∩α is stationary in α}

For α &lt; κ+, define the subsets Mα(κ) ⊆ κ inductively as follows:
*M0(κ) is the set of regular cardinals below κ,
*Mα+1(κ) is the set of regular λ &lt; κ such that Mα(κ) ∩ λ is stationary in λ,
*for limits α with cf(α) &lt; κ, Mα(κ) is the intersection of Mβ(κ) over all β &lt; α, and
*for limits α with cf(α) = κ, pick an enumeration f : κ → α of a cofinal subset. Then, Mα(κ) is the set of all λ &lt; κ such that λ ∈ Mf(γ)(κ) for all γ &lt; λ.

Although the exact definition depends on a choice of cofinal subset for each α &lt; κ+ of cofinality κ, any choice will give the same sequence of subsets modulo the nonstationary ideal.

For δ ≤ κ+, κ is then called δ-Mahlo if and only if Mα(κ) is stationary in κ for all α &lt; δ. A cardinal κ is κ+-Mahlo if and only if it is greatly Mahlo.

The properties of being inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly Mahlo, α-Mahlo, greatly Mahlo, etc. are preserved if we replace the universe by an inner model.

Every reflecting cardinal has strictly more consistency strength than a greatly Mahlo, but inaccessible reflecting cardinals aren&#x27;t in general Mahlo.

==The Mahlo operation==

If &quot;X&quot; is a class of ordinals, then we can form a new class of ordinals &quot;M&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) consisting of the ordinals α of uncountable cofinality such that α∩&quot;X&quot; is stationary in α. This operation &quot;M&quot; is called the Mahlo operation. It can be used to define Mahlo cardinals: for example, if &quot;X&quot; is the class of regular cardinals, then &quot;M&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is the class of weakly Mahlo cardinals. The condition that α has uncountable cofinality ensures that the closed unbounded subsets of α are closed under intersection and so form a filter; in practice the elements of &quot;X&quot; often already have uncountable cofinality in which case this condition is redundant. Some authors add the condition that α is in &quot;X&quot;, which in practice usually makes little difference as it is often automatically satisfied.

For a fixed regular uncountable cardinal κ, the Mahlo operation induces an operation on the Boolean algebra of all subsets of κ modulo the non-stationary ideal.

The Mahlo operation can be iterated transfinitely as follows:
*&quot;M&quot;0(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot;
*&quot;M&quot;α+1(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;M&quot;(&quot;M&quot;α(&quot;X&quot;))
*If α is a limit ordinal then &quot;M&quot;α(&quot;X&quot;) is the intersection of &quot;M&quot;β(&quot;X&quot;) for β&lt;α

These iterated Mahlo operations produce the classes of α-Mahlo cardinals starting with the class of strongly inaccessible cardinals.

It is also possible to diagonalize this process by defining
*&quot;M&quot;Δ(&quot;X&quot;) is the set of ordinals α that are in &quot;M&quot;β(&quot;X&quot;) for β&lt;α.
And of course this diagonalization process can be iterated too. The diagonalized Mahlo operation produces the hyper-Mahlo cardinals, and so on.

==Mahlo cardinals and reflection principles==

Axiom F is the statement that every normal function on the ordinals has a regular fixed point. (This is not a first-order axiom as it quantifies over all normal functions, so it can be considered either as a second-order axiom or as an axiom scheme.)
A cardinal is called Mahlo if every normal function on it has a regular fixed point, so axiom F is in some sense saying that the class of all ordinals is Mahlo. A cardinal κ is Mahlo if and only if a second-order form of axiom F holds in &quot;V&quot;κ. Axiom F is in turn equivalent to the statement that for any formula φ with parameters there are arbitrarily large inaccessible ordinals α such that &quot;V&quot;α reflects φ (in other words φ holds in &quot;V&quot;α if and only if it holds in the whole universe) .

==Appearance in Borel diagonalization==
 has shown that existence of Mahlo cardinals is a necessary assumption in a sense to prove certain theorems about Borel functions on products of the closed unit interval.

Let formula_15 be formula_16, the formula_17-fold iterated Cartesian product of the closed unit interval with itself. The group formula_18 of all permutations of formula_19 that move only finitely many natural numbers can be seen as acting on formula_15 by permuting coordinates. The group action formula_21 also acts diagonally on any of the products formula_22, by defining an abuse of notation formula_23. For formula_24, let formula_25 if formula_26 and formula_27 are in the same orbit under this diagonal action.

Let formula_28 be a Borel function such that for any formula_29 and formula_30, if formula_31 then formula_32. Then there is a sequence formula_33 such that for all sequences of indices formula_34, formula_35 is the first coordinate of formula_36. This theorem is provable in formula_37, but not in any theory formula_38 for some fixed formula_39.

<text>Norwich City Football Club is a professional football club based in Norwich, Norfolk, England. The club competes in the Championship, the second tier of English football. The club was founded in 1902. Since 1935, Norwich have played their home games at Carrow Road and have a long-standing rivalry with East Anglian rivals Ipswich Town, with whom they have contested the East Anglian derby since 1902.

Norwich have won the League Cup twice, in 1962 and 1985. The club&#x27;s highest-ever league finish came in the 1992–93 season when they finished third in the Premier League. Norwich have featured in the UEFA Cup once, in the 1993–94 season, where they were defeated in the third round, but en route became the first English club to defeat German side Bayern Munich at the Olympiastadion in Munich.

The club is nicknamed &quot;The Canaries&quot; after the history of breeding the birds in the area, which is represented by the canary in team&#x27;s badge and traditionally yellow-and-green home kits. The fans&#x27; song &quot;On The Ball, City&quot; is the oldest football chant in the world, written in the 1890s and still sung today.

===Early years (1902–1934)===
Norwich City F.C. was formed after a meeting at the Criterion Café in Norwich on 17 June 1902 and played their first competitive match, against Harwich &amp; Parkeston, at Newmarket Road on 6 September 1902. They joined the Norfolk &amp; Suffolk League for the 1902–03 season, but following a FA commission, the club was ousted from the amateur game in 1905, as it was deemed a professional organisation. Later that year Norwich were elected to play in the Southern League. With increasing crowds, they were forced to leave Newmarket Road in 1908 and moved to The Nest, a disused chalk pit. The club&#x27;s original nickname was the Citizens, but this was superseded by 1907 by the Canaries after the club&#x27;s chairman (who was a keen breeder of canaries) dubbed his boys &quot;The Canaries&quot; and changed their strip to yellow and green. During the First World War, with football suspended and facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary liquidation on 10 December 1917.

The club was officially reformed on 15 February 1919 – a key figure in the event was Charles Frederick Watling, future lord mayor of Norwich and the father of future club chairman, Geoffrey Watling. When the Football League formed a third Division in May 1920, Norwich joined the Third Division for the following season. Their first league fixture, against Plymouth Argyle, on 28 August 1920, ended in a 1–1 draw. The club went on to endure a mediocre decade, finishing no higher than eighth but no lower than 18th. The following decade proved more successful for the club with a club-record victory, 10–2, over Coventry City. Norwich were promoted as champions to the Second Division in the 1933–34 season under the management of Tom Parker.

===Move to Carrow Road and an FA Cup semi-final (1934–1959)===
With crowds continuing to rise, and with the Football Association raising concerns over the suitability of The Nest, the club considered renovation of the ground, but ultimately decided on a move to Carrow Road. The inaugural match, on 31 August 1935 against West Ham United, ended in a 4–3 victory for the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. The biggest highlight of the following four seasons was the visit of King George VI to Carrow Road on 29 October 1938. However the club was relegated to the Third Division at the end of the season.

The league was suspended the following season due to the Second World War, and did not resume until the 1946–47 season. City finished this and the following season in 21st place, the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league. The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager Norman Low in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the 1956–57 season.

Events off the field were to overshadow the team&#x27;s performances as the club faced financial difficulties severe enough to render them non-viable. With debts amounting to more than £20,000, the club was rescued by the formation of a new board, chaired by Geoffrey Watling and the creation of an appeal fund chaired by the Lord Mayor of Norwich, Arthur South, which raised more than £20,000. For these and other services to the club, both men (now deceased) were later honoured by having stands named after them at Carrow Road.

Archie Macaulay became manager when the club was reformed and he oversaw one of the club&#x27;s greatest achievements, its run to the semi-final of the 1958–59 FA Cup. Competing as a Third Division side, Norwich defeated two First Division opponents along the way, notably a 3–0 win against the Manchester United &quot;Busby Babes&quot;. City lost the semi-final only after a replay against another First Division side, Luton Town. The team of 1958–59 – including Terry Bly who scored seven goals in the run, and Ken Nethercott who played most of the second half of one match in goal despite a dislocated shoulder – is today well represented in the club Hall of Fame. The &quot;59 Cup Run&quot; as it is now known locally, &quot;remains as one of the truly great periods in Norwich City&#x27;s history&quot;. Norwich were the third-ever Third Division team to reach the FA Cup semi-final.

===League Cup glory and a place in the First Division (1959–1980)===
In the 1959–60 season, Norwich were promoted to the Second Division after finishing second to Southampton, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the 1960–61 season. In 1962 Ron Ashman guided Norwich to their first trophy, defeating Rochdale 4–0 on aggregate in a two-legged final to win the League Cup.

Sixth place in the league was the closest the club came to promotion to the First Division again during the 1960s, but after winning the division in the 1971–72 season under manager Ron Saunders, Norwich City reached the highest level of English football for the first time. They made their first appearance at Wembley Stadium in 1973, losing the League Cup final 1–0 to Tottenham Hotspur.

Relegation to the Second Division in 1973–74 season came after Saunders had departed and been succeeded by John Bond, but the board of directors kept faith in Bond and were quickly rewarded. A highly successful first season saw promotion back to the First Division, and another visit to Wembley, again in the League Cup final, this time losing 1–0 to Aston Villa.

===Promotion, silverware and more cup runs (1980–1992)===
Bond departed to Manchester City in autumn 1980, and the club were relegated six months later, but bounced back the following season after finishing third under Bond&#x27;s successor Ken Brown. In August 1981, Norwich City striker Justin Fashanu became the first black footballer to command a £1 million transfer fee when he moved to Nottingham Forest.

The 1984–85 season was of mixed fortunes for the club; under Brown&#x27;s guidance, they reached the final of the Football League Cup at Wembley Stadium, having defeated Ipswich Town in the semi-final. In the final, they beat Sunderland 1–0, but in the league, both Norwich and Sunderland were relegated to the second tier of English football, Norwich going down by only one point. This made Norwich the first English club to win a major trophy and suffer relegation in the same season; something which was not matched until Birmingham City also suffered relegation the season they won the League Cup 26 years later.

Norwich were also denied their first foray into Europe with the ban on English clubs after the Heysel Stadium disaster. City bounced back to the top flight by winning the Second Division championship in the 1985–86 season. This was the start a club-record nine consecutive seasons in the top division of English football. High league placing in the First Division in 1988–89 would have been enough for UEFA Cup qualification, but the ban on English clubs remained. They also had good cup runs during this period, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1989 and again in 1992.

===Early success in the Premier League era (1992–1995)===
During 1992–93, the inaugural season of the Premier League, Norwich City quickly emerged as surprise title contenders, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and runners-up Aston Villa. The following season Norwich participated in the UEFA Cup for the first (and only) time, losing in the third round to Inter Milan, but defeating Bayern Munich. Winning 2–1, Norwich were the first British team to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympiastadion.

Mike Walker quit as Norwich City manager in January 1994, to take charge of Everton and was replaced by first team coach John Deehan who led the club to 12th place in the 1993–94 season in the Premier League. Norwich began the 1994–95 season well, despite the pre-season departure of top scorer Chris Sutton to Blackburn Rovers for a British record fee of £5 million, and by Christmas they were seventh in the league. Norwich then won only one of their final 20 league games, and slumped to 20th place and relegation, ending a nine-season run in the top flight.

===The First Division years (1995–2003)===
Shortly before relegation, Deehan resigned as manager and his assistant Gary Megson took over until the end of the season. Martin O&#x27;Neill, who had taken Wycombe Wanderers from the Conference to the Second Division with successive promotions, was appointed as Norwich City manager in summer 1995. He lasted just six months in the job before resigning after a dispute with chairman Robert Chase over money to strengthen the squad. Soon after, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club&#x27;s best players and was to blame for their relegation. Chase&#x27;s majority stakeholding was bought by Geoffrey Watling.

English television cook Delia Smith and husband Michael Wynn-Jones took over the majority of Norwich City&#x27;s shares from Watling in 1996, and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the club&#x27;s manager. He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was dismissed two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in Division One. Nigel Worthington took over as Norwich City manager in December 2000 following an unsuccessful two years for the club under Bruce Rioch and then Bryan Hamilton. He had been on the coaching staff under Hamilton who resigned with the club 20th in the First Division and in real danger of relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time since the 1960s. Worthington avoided the threat of relegation and, the following season, led City to a play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, which Norwich lost against Birmingham City on penalties.

===Return to the Premier League (2003–2009)===
The 2003–04 season saw the club win the First Division title, finishing eight points clear of second-placed West Bromwich Albion and returned to the top flight for the first time since 1995. For much of the 2004–05 season, the club struggled and a last day 6–0 defeat away to Fulham condemned them to relegation. The club finished in ninth place in the Championship in the 2005–06 season and, as results in the 2006–07 season went against City, Worthington was dismissed in October 2006, directly after a 4–1 defeat by Burnley.

In October 2006, Norwich announced that former City player Peter Grant had left West Ham United to become the new manager. Grant&#x27;s side struggled for most of the season and made a poor start to the 2007–08 season, with only two wins by mid October; following a 1–0 defeat at fellow-strugglers Queens Park Rangers, Grant left the club by mutual consent on in October 2007. Later the same month, former Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder was confirmed as Grant&#x27;s replacement.
Roeder kept Norwich in the Championship with a 3–0 win over Queens Park Rangers, Norwich&#x27;s penultimate game of the season.

===Yo-yo years (2009–present)===
In January 2009, Roeder was relieved of his duties as manager and, shortly after, former Norwich goalkeeper Bryan Gunn was appointed until the end of the season. However, he was unable to prevent the club from being relegated in May 2009, after a 4–2 defeat away to already relegated Charlton Athletic. Following their relegation, their first game of the season resulted in a 7–1 home defeat against East Anglian rivals Colchester United. This was the club&#x27;s heaviest ever home defeat and Gunn was dismissed six days later.

On 18 August 2009, Paul Lambert was announced as the new manager, leaving his post at Colchester, and nine months later led Norwich to promotion back to the Championship as League One Champions, after a single season in League One. The following season saw Norwich promoted to the Premier League, finishing second in the table and completing the first back-to-back promotions from the third tier to second and to the first since Manchester City in 2000.

The club finished in 12th place in their first season back in the Premier League. However, Lambert resigned within a month of the season&#x27;s close to take up the vacant managerial spot at league rivals Aston Villa and was replaced by Chris Hughton. Hughton led Norwich to an 11th-place finish, including a ten-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were relegated back to the Championship after the 2013–14 season. Hughton was dismissed to be replaced by former Norwich player Neil Adams.

After a mediocre first half of the 2014–15 season, Adams resigned in January 2015 and Hamilton Academical manager Alex Neil was appointed as Norwich manager four days later. The appointment reinvigorated Norwich&#x27;s season, and victory in the 2015 Championship play-off final secured an immediate return to the top division of English football. This was only temporary relief, as at the end of the next season they were relegated again to play the 2016–17 season in the Championship.

The following season started successfully, with the club sitting top of the Championship in mid-October. However, a poor run of form and results followed and in March 2017, Neil was dismissed by the club. First-team coach Alan Irvine was placed in caretaker charge for the remainder of the season, ultimately finishing in eighth.
In May 2017, the club appointed German coach Daniel Farke as head coach, becoming the first head coach of the club in its 114-year history that was not from the British Isles. In Farke&#x27;s first season, Norwich finished in 14th place. The following season was far more successful; helped by top scorer Teemu Pukki, the club was promoted back to the Premier League after a three-year absence as Championship winners. However, Norwich were once again relegated back to the Championship after just a single season back in the top flight, becoming the first team in Premier League history to be relegated five times from the division. The yo-yo effect continued unabated: in May 2021, Norwich were crowned winners of the Championship, securing promotion back to the top flight at the first time of asking, but they failed to win a match in their first nine games back in the Premier League in the 2021–22 season, and Farke was dismissed by the club in November. On 14 November 2021, the club appointed former Walsall, Brentford and Aston Villa manager Dean Smith as their new head coach. Norwich completed a record sixth relegation from the Premier League, and, after an indifferent first half of the following season, Smith was dismissed in December 2022.

On 6 January 2023, the club appointed former Huddersfield Town, Schalke and Young Boys manager David Wagner as their new head coach. After a thirteenth-place finish under Wagner in the 2022-23 season, the club improved to a sixth-placed finish in 2023-24 and qualified for the Championship playoffs. However, on 17 May 2024, Wagner was sacked by the club after fifteen months in charge following a 4–0 loss on aggregate against Leeds United in the playoff semi-finals.

On 30 May 2024, the club appointed Johannes Hoff Thorup as their new head coach, who joined from Danish Superliga club FC Nordsjælland on a three-year contract.

==Colours and badge==


Norwich City&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Canaries&quot;, has long influenced the team&#x27;s colours and badge. Originally, the club was nicknamed the &quot;Citizens&quot; (&quot;Cits&quot; for short), and played in light blue and white halved shirts, although the halves were inconsistent: the blue was on the left on some shirts, and on the right for others. The earliest known recorded link between the club and canaries comes in an interview recorded in the &quot;Eastern Daily Press&quot; with the newly appointed manager, John Bowman in April 1905. The paper quotes him saying &quot;Well I knew of the City&#x27;s existence... I have... heard of the canaries.&quot; &quot;This as far as we can tell is the first time that the popular pastime of the day ie... rearing ... canaries was linked with Norwich City FC... the club still played in blue and white, and would continue to do so for another two seasons&quot; wrote one history of the club.

By February 1907, the nickname Canaries had come more into vogue; thoughts that an FA Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion (nicknamed &quot;Throstles&quot; after a bird) was &quot;a bird -singing contest&quot; were dismissed by the polymath C. B. Fry as &quot;humbug&quot; but the national press increasingly referred to the team as Canaries. The following season, to match the nickname, City played for the first time in Canary livery; &quot;yellow shirts with green collars and cuffs. One paper produced the quote &#x27;The Cits are dead but the Canaries are very much alive&#x27;.&quot; While the home colours of yellow and green remain to this day, the away colours have varied since introduction. For example, the away kit for the 2012–13 season was black shirts and shorts.

A simple canary badge was first adopted in 1922. The current club badge consists of a canary resting on a football with a stylised version of the City of Norwich arms in the top left corner. For the club&#x27;s centenary celebrations in 2002, a special badge was designed, featuring two canaries looking left and right, plus a ribbon noting the centenary.

In November 2021, the club unveiled a new club badge that officially replaced the previous badge on all club branding from June 2022 and that would appear on club shirts from the 2022–23 season. It is a modernised version of its predecessor that removed black keylines around the badge, a redesigned version of the city&#x27;s coat of arms that more closely resembles a lion and Norwich Castle, and a redesigned canary on a ball that&#x27;s more centralised in the badge than its predecessor.

==Stadium==
Norwich City played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908, with a record attendance of 10,366 against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908. Following a dispute over the conditions of renting the Newmarket Road ground, in 1908 the club moved to a new home in a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as &quot;The Nest&quot;.
By the 1930s, the ground was too small for the growing crowds, and in 1935 the club moved to its current home in Carrow Road. The original stadium, &quot;the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle... was &quot;miraculously&quot; built in just 82 days... it was referred to [by club officials] as &#x27;The eighth wonder of the world&#x27;&quot; An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand, with a Colman&#x27;s Mustard advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. Another photograph, taken on a match day that same season, shows that a parking area was provided at the ground.

Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956, but their cost of £9,000 nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. The success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and allowed a cover to be built over the South Stand. This was itself replaced in 2003 when a new 7,000 seat South stand was built in its place and subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand.

1963 saw the record attendance for Carrow Road, with a crowd of 43,984 for a 6th round FA Cup match against Leicester City. After the Ibrox disaster in 1971, safety licences were required by clubs and this drastically reduced the ground&#x27;s capacity to around 20,000. A two-tier terrace was built at the River End, and seats began to replace the terraces. By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28,392 with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands, which eventually led to its complete demolition and replacement by 1987 of a new City Stand, which chairman Robert Chase described as &quot;Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre – the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass&quot;. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater. It has a capacity of 27,150.

==Supporters==
===Song===

The fans&#x27; song, &quot;On the Ball, City&quot;, is the oldest football song in the world still in use today; the song is older than the club itself, having probably been penned for Norwich Teachers or Caley&#x27;s FC in the 1890s and adapted for Norwich City. Although the first use of the tune and song is disputed, it had been adopted by 1902 and it remains in use today in part if not the whole. The chorus is:
===People===
While much of the support that the club enjoys is local, there are a number of expatriate fan clubs, notably in London and stretching from Scandinavia to countries further afield such as the United Arab Emirates, North Macedonia, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia, and the United States. The London supporters&#x27; club is known as the Capital Canaries, and was founded in 1975. They gather at The Old Red Lion in The Angel, Islington to watch live games.

The club also maintains a healthy celebrity support with celebrity cook Delia Smith and comedian Stephen Fry both having moved from being fans of the club to running it. Actor Hugh Jackman is also a fan of the club, having been taken to Carrow Road as a child by his English mother, though he turned down an opportunity to become an investor in the club in 2010. Other well-known supporters include television presenter Simon Thomas, who is vice-president of the Norwich City Supporters Trust, Norfolk-born musician, model and media personality Myleene Klass, fiction author Philip Pullman, and former Labour politician Ed Balls. Journalist and broadcaster David Frost also declared his love for The Canaries during his lifetime.

In March 2018, supporters helped the club raise £5 million through a mini-bond investment scheme. The purpose of the mini-bond, called the Canaries Bond was to raise money to fund new academy facilities at Colney Training Ground for the Norwich City F.C. Under-23s and Academy.

===Local rivalry===
The club&#x27;s main local rival is Ipswich Town. When Norwich and Ipswich meet it is known as the East Anglian derby, or, informally, as the &quot;Old Farm Derby&quot; – a comic reference to the Old Firm derby played between Scottish clubs Celtic and Rangers. Norwich are unbeaten against Ipswich since .

Locally, much is made of the informal title &quot;Pride of Anglia&quot;. Fans variously claim the title for either winning the East Anglian derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position or having the more successful club history.

==Current ownership==
Norwich City F.C. is a public limited company that, in 2003, comprised approximately 8,000 individual shareholdings. , the group Norfolk Holdings, led by American businessman and Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio are the majority shareholders, having taken over from the former majority shareholders, English cook and television presenter Delia Smith and her husband, Welsh writer Michael Wynn-Jones, who had held the title since 1998.

At the 2006–07 Norwich City FC Annual General Meeting (on 18 January 2007), Smith and Wynn-Jones announced that they would be open to offers to buy their majority stake-holding in the club. They made clear that any prospective buyer would have to invest heavily in the squad, with regards to team improving.

In September 2022, a general meeting of shareholders took place to discuss and voted for Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio to be appointed as a director at the club. Attanasio was expected to buy the 15.9% stake in the club as was owned by Michael Foulger. It was later announced by the club he had purchased shares from a variety of holders, which included Foulger&#x27;s shares, as part of his investment group, “Norfolk Holdings”. In April 2024, Attanasio&#x27;s stake in the club was increased to 40.4% following EFL ratification, making him joint majority shareholder alongside Smith and Wynn-Jones.

On 12 August 2024, the club announced that a deal had been reached for Attanasio to increase his stake to 85% and take majority control of the club, subject to takeover panel and shareholder approval. As part of the deal, Smith and Wynn-Jones would also stand down from their respective roles as club directors and become honorary life presidents as well as reduce their stake in the club to 10%. The deal was approved by the clubs other shareholders at a general meeting on 23 October 2024 with Smith &amp; Wynn-Jones stepping down from the board of directors with immediate effect, bringing their twenty-eight years of involvement with the club to an end.

==Records and statistics==


Ashman holds the record for Norwich league appearances, having played 592 first-team matches between 1947 and 1964. Ralph Hunt holds the record for the most goals scored in a season, 31 in the 1955–56 season in the Third Division South, with Johnny Gavin the top scorer over a career – 122 between 1948 and 1955

The club&#x27;s widest victory margin in the league was their 10–2 win against Coventry City in the Third Division South in 1930. Their heaviest defeat in the league was 10–2 against Swindon Town in 1908 in the Southern League.

Norwich&#x27;s record home attendance is 43,984 for a sixth-round FA Cup match against Leicester City on 30 March 1963. In the wake of the Ibrox stadium disaster in 1971, government regulations resulted in the capacity being drastically reduced to around 20,000. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report in 1990, the stadium was converted to all-seater. As of July 2020, the capacity is 27,359.

The highest transfer fee received for a Norwich player is £33 million from Aston Villa for Emiliano Buendía in June 2021, while the most spent by the club on a player was for the signing of Christos Tzolis for £8.8 million from PAOK FC in August 2021.

The club&#x27;s highest league finish was third in the Premier League in 1992–93. The 2021–22 season was Norwich&#x27;s 27th in the top flight of English football. The club has won the League Cup twice (most recently in 1985) and reached the FA Cup semi-final three times, most recently in 1992. Norwich have taken part in European competition once, reaching the third round of the UEFA Cup in 1993–94 and are the only English side to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympiastadion.

==Players==
===First-team squad===











===Out on loan===


===Development squad===
This team is made up of under-23 and academy players and is effectively Norwich City&#x27;s second-string side, but is limited to three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 23 per game.

In March 2018, the public mini-bond investment scheme mentioned above raised £5 million. With this investment, the club installed new pitches at its Category 1 Academy, as well as a new irrigation system, cameras for analysis and floodlights, a new main building, with a gym, classrooms, physios room, changing rooms and offices. A stand was also installed next to the main Academy pitch.

==In popular culture==
In 1972 the Children&#x27;s Film Foundation released a movie called &quot;The Boy Who Turned Yellow&quot; about a boy living in London who supports Norwich City. In the film, he and everyone and everything else on his tube train are turned yellow. That night he is visited by a yellow alien called Nick, short for electronic, who teaches him all about electricity. The link to the football club is used to explain why the boy already has so many yellow things in his bedroom.

In the 2001 film &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;, the eponymous hero, played by Ricky Tomlinson, rises to prominence as a result of success as manager of Norwich City, having won the &#x27;Mr Clutch Cup&#x27;. The celebratory scenes of the open-top bus ride around the city were actually shot in St Albans, Hertfordshire, rather than Norwich.

==Norwich City Women==

Norwich City Women is the women&#x27;s football club affiliated to Norwich City. Since 2022, the general manager is Flo Allen, and they currently compete in Division One South East, in the fourth tier of English women&#x27;s football. Norwich City Women play their home games at The Nest, a site at Horsford.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of set theory, 0# (zero sharp, also 0#) is the set of true formulae about indiscernibles and order-indiscernibles in the Gödel constructible universe. It is often encoded as a subset of the natural numbers (using Gödel numbering), or as a subset of the hereditarily finite sets, or as a real number. Its existence is unprovable in ZFC, the standard form of axiomatic set theory, but follows from a suitable large cardinal axiom. It was first introduced as a set of formulae in Silver&#x27;s 1966 thesis, later published as , where it was denoted by Σ, and rediscovered by , who considered it as a subset of the natural numbers and introduced the notation O# (with a capital letter O; this later changed to the numeral &#x27;0&#x27;).

Roughly speaking, if 0# exists then the universe &quot;V&quot; of sets is much larger than the universe &quot;L&quot; of constructible sets, while if it does not exist then the universe of all sets is closely approximated by the constructible sets.

== Definition ==

Zero sharp was defined by Silver and Solovay as follows. Consider the language of set theory with extra constant symbols formula_1, formula_2, ... for each nonzero natural number. Then formula_3 is defined to be the set of Gödel numbers of the true sentences about the constructible universe, with formula_4 interpreted as the uncountable cardinal formula_5.
(Here formula_5 means formula_5 in the full universe, not the constructible universe.)

There is a subtlety about this definition: by Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem it is not, in general, possible to define the truth of a formula of set theory in the language of set theory. To solve this, Silver and Solovay assumed the existence of a suitable large cardinal, such as a Ramsey cardinal, and showed that with this extra assumption it is possible to define the truth of statements about the constructible universe. More generally, the definition of formula_3 works provided that there is an uncountable set of indiscernibles for some formula_9, and the phrase &quot;formula_3 exists&quot; is used as a shorthand way of saying this.

A closed set formula_11 of order-indiscernibles for formula_9 (where formula_13 is a limit ordinal) is a set of &quot;Silver indiscernibles&quot; if:
*formula_11 is unbounded in formula_13, and
*if formula_16 is unbounded in an ordinal formula_17, then the Skolem hull of formula_16 in formula_19 is formula_19. In other words, every formula_21 is definable in formula_19 from parameters in formula_16.

If there is a set of Silver indiscernibles for formula_24, then it is unique. Additionally, for any uncountable cardinal formula_25 there will be a unique set of Silver indiscernibles for formula_26. The union of all these sets will be a proper class formula_11 of Silver indiscernibles for the structure formula_28 itself. Then, formula_3 is defined as the set of all Gödel numbers of formulae formula_30 such that

formula_31

where formula_32 is any strictly increasing sequence of members of formula_11. Because they are indiscernibles, the definition does not depend on the choice of sequence.

Any formula_34 has the property that formula_35. This allows for a definition of truth for the constructible universe:

formula_36 only if formula_37 for some formula_34.

There are several minor variations of the definition of formula_3, which make no significant difference to its properties. There are many different choices of Gödel numbering, and formula_3 depends on this choice. Instead of being considered as a subset of the natural numbers, it is also possible to encode formula_3 as a subset of formulae of a language, or as a subset of the hereditarily finite sets, or as a real number.

==Statements implying existence==

The condition about the existence of a Ramsey cardinal implying that formula_3 exists can be weakened. The existence of formula_43-Erdős cardinals implies the existence of formula_3. This is close to being best possible, because the existence of formula_3 implies that in the constructible universe there is an formula_13-Erdős cardinal for all countable formula_13, so such cardinals cannot be used to prove the existence of formula_3.

Chang&#x27;s conjecture implies the existence of formula_3.

==Statements equivalent to existence==
Kunen showed that formula_3 exists if and only if there exists a non-trivial elementary embedding for the Gödel constructible universe formula_28 into itself.

Donald A. Martin and Leo Harrington have shown that the existence of formula_3 is equivalent to the determinacy of lightface analytic games. In fact, the strategy for a universal lightface analytic game has the same Turing degree as formula_3.

It follows from Jensen&#x27;s covering theorem that the existence of formula_3 is equivalent to formula_55 being a regular cardinal in the constructible universe formula_28.

Silver showed that the existence of an uncountable set of indiscernibles in the constructible universe is equivalent to the existence of formula_3.

== Consequences of existence and non-existence ==
The existence of formula_3 implies that every uncountable cardinal in the set-theoretic universe formula_59 is an indiscernible in formula_28 and satisfies all large cardinal axioms that are realized in formula_28 (such as being totally ineffable). It follows that the existence of formula_3 contradicts the &quot;axiom of constructibility&quot;: formula_63.

If formula_3 exists, then it is an example of a non-constructible formula_65 set of natural numbers. This is in some sense the simplest possibility for a non-constructible set, since all formula_66 and formula_67 sets of natural numbers are constructible.

On the other hand, if formula_3 does not exist, then the constructible universe formula_28 is the core model—that is, the canonical inner model that approximates the large cardinal structure of the universe considered. In that case, Jensen&#x27;s covering lemma holds:

:For every uncountable set formula_70 of ordinals there is a constructible formula_71 such that formula_72 and formula_71 has the same cardinality as formula_70.

This deep result is due to Ronald Jensen. Using forcing it is easy to see that the condition that formula_70 is uncountable cannot be removed. For example, consider Namba forcing, that preserves formula_43 and collapses formula_77 to an ordinal of cofinality formula_78. Let formula_79 be an formula_78-sequence cofinal on formula_81 and generic over formula_28. Then no set in formula_28 of formula_28-size smaller than formula_81 (which is uncountable in formula_59, since formula_43 is preserved) can cover formula_79, since formula_77 is a regular cardinal.

If formula_3 does not exist, it also follows that the singular cardinals hypothesis holds.p. 20

== Other sharps ==
If formula_70 is any set, then formula_92 is defined analogously to formula_3 except that one uses formula_94 instead of formula_28, also with a predicate symbol for formula_70. See Constructible universe#Relative constructibility.

Since 2013, Mihok has co-starred as Brendan &quot;Bunchy&quot; Donovan in the Showtime drama &quot;Ray Donovan&quot;. Bunchy had been sexually abused by a priest as a child and is an alcoholic and has sexual anorexia. For the show the cast works out at the Santa Monica, California boxing gym Wild Card West with boxer Rob Garcia. Mihok was slated to direct an episode in 2017, as he said he has been directing pilots to prepare. He directed the season 7 episode &quot;An Irish Lullaby&quot; which aired December 15, 2019.

In 2014, he portrayed Whelan, in the horror-thriller film, &quot;Before I Wake,&quot; co-starring in the Mike Flanagan-directed film Annabeth Gish, Thomas Jane and Kate Bosworth.

Adams, Octavia Spencer, Josh Hopkins, among others. In 2022, he played Derek, an intellectually disabled man, in &quot;Wildflower&quot;.

===Music===
When he was 12 years old, Mihok started a band with his friends called S.D.C. (Sam, Dash, Chris aka Strictly Devastating Crew).

In 2004, Mihok appeared on Sicilian-Puerto Rican New York-based rapper Sabac Red&#x27;s record &quot;,&quot; on the track &quot;I Have A Dream.&quot; The lyrics refer to tics that people exhibit as symptoms of Tourette syndrome. For the 2005 movie &quot;Green Street Hooligans,&quot; Mihok wrote the title track &quot;Test of a Man.&quot; During this time he also collaborated with Daniel Freedman, a jazz drummer, percussionist, and composer on various music projects.

Since 2015, Mihok has been in the band Diz and the Fam. Members of Diz and the Fam are Mike Choi, Kenny Echizen, Justin Frazier, Sharlotte Gibson, Morris Hayes, Joel Hellman, Brett Nolan, and Elliot Yamin. The band has released three singles. The 2015 video for &quot;Love (feat. Jeff Taylor)&quot; features many actors from &quot;Ray Donovan.&quot;

===Other work===
Mihok studied dance. He can be seen dancing opposite then-girlfriend Alanis Morissette in her music video &quot;So Pure&quot;. Mihok is also a photographer. His photography of Morissette is used on the back cover of her &quot;Thank U&quot; single and is credited for &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Mihok was named after writer Dashiell Hammett, the author of &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, &quot;The Glass Key&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. His Czech surname is pronounced &quot;my&quot;-Hawk.

Mihok was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome at age six, and is a spokesperson and is on the board for the nonprofit Jaylen&#x27;s Challenge, founded by the then 9-year-old, Jaylen Arnold. He is an active supporter of the Tourette Syndrome Association. Mihok&#x27;s two older sisters both have Tourette&#x27;s; it is often genetic.

Mihok once stated that an early reason he became an actor was because he had so much experience in hiding his Tourette&#x27;s. He said the focus required of acting allows him to mask many of his tics. Mihok says the biggest misconception about Tourette&#x27;s Syndrome is about vocal tics, called coprolalia. Not everyone with Tourette&#x27;s does that: &quot;Tics tend to wax and wane, not everybody&#x27;s screaming obscenities all the time.&quot; Mihok said he took medication during high school for the Tourette&#x27;s. 

In 1997, Mihok met Alanis Morissette through mutual friend Leonardo DiCaprio during a trip to Cuba. The lyrics to the songs &quot;So Pure&quot; from &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot; and &quot;That Particular Time&quot; from &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot; are about him.

In 2009, Mihok married singer Valeria Mason. They have two children and live in Los Angeles. Mihok has said that he is a Roman Catholic.

<text>The &quot;iron vote&quot; is a political term for a voter that can be reliably counted on to vote for one party or another. This phrase was most notably used beginning as early as a decade ago in Asian democratic elections, specifically Taiwan: Taiwanese . These usually include strong supporters of Taiwan independence or Chinese unification.

The Kuomintang (KMT) was defeated in 2000 elections by the loss of iron votes. The result shows that &quot;iron vote&quot; can only be taken as reference. People who strongly believe in their &quot;iron vote&quot; may have an unexpected outcome. 
The same term is also used in Hong Kong, referring to strong supporters of the pro-democracy camp or the pro-Beijing camp.

A related term in United States politics is yellow dog Democrat. The opposite is a swing voter.

<doc id="248088" wikidata="Q2902447" url="?curid=248088" title="Yellow dog Democrat">
<text>Yellow dog Democrats is a political term that was applied to voters in the Southern United States who voted solely for candidates who represented the Democratic Party. The term originated in the late 19th century. These voters would allegedly &quot;vote for a yellow dog before they would vote for any Republican&quot;, or, &quot;vote for a yellow dog if he ran on the Democratic ticket&quot;. The term is now more generally applied to refer to any Democrat who will vote a straight party ticket under any circumstances. The South Carolina Democratic Party and Mississippi Democratic Party, among other state parties, continue to use the phrase to refer to committed members of the Democratic Party in the &quot;Yellow Dog Club&quot;.

According to journalist Ed Kilgore, Yellow Dog Democrats were Southerners who saw the Democratic Party as &quot;the default vehicle for day-to-day political life, and the dominant presence, regardless of ideology, for state and local politics.&quot;

The term &quot;yellow dog&quot; may be a reference to the Carolina Dog, a dog breed without European heritage and indigenous to the Americas (specifically the Southern United States).

==History and usage==
The phrase &quot;Yellow Dog Democrat&quot; is thought to have first achieved popularity during the 1928 presidential race between Democratic candidate Al Smith and Republican candidate Herbert Hoover, when Senator J. Thomas Heflin (D-Alabama) crossed party lines and formally supported Hoover. Many Southern voters disliked several items on Smith&#x27;s platform, as well as his Roman Catholic faith, but still voted for him.

However, the term did not originate from the election of 1928, and there were earlier recorded usages. It was used by Abraham Lincoln in an 1848 speech on the presidential campaign of General Zachary Taylor, whose Democratic opponent was General Lewis Cass. Lincoln derided Cass as one of several recent Democratic presidential candidates in the mold of Andrew Jackson by saying:

A fellow once advertised that he had made a discovery by which he could make a new man out of an old one, and have enough of the stuff left to make a little yellow dog. Just such a discovery has Gen. Jackson&#x27;s popularity been to you [Democrats]. You not only twice made President of him out of it, but you have had enough of the stuff left to make presidents of several comparatively small men since; and it is your chief reliance now to make still another.

In the run-up to the 1892 presidential election, African-American journalist C. H. J. Taylor of Kansas City, Kansas, in his paper &quot;The American Citizen&quot;, used the term to refer to Republicans in the West who, he wrote, &quot;would vote for a yellow dog out there if he was named Republican.&quot; In 1893, the &quot;Kansas City Journal&quot;, a Republican newspaper, criticized &quot;This thing of voting for &#x27;yaller dogs&#x27;, and expecting them to turn black-and-tan after the election,&quot; with reference to Missouri voters always voting for Democrats, then being surprised at their allegedly invariable corruption.

In the 1899 contest for governor in Kentucky, Theodore Hallam was criticized at a Democratic Party meeting for first supporting William Goebel, then campaigning against him. The critic pointed out that Hallam earlier had said &quot;if the Democrats of Kentucky, in convention assembled, nominated a yaller dog for governor you would vote for him&quot; and asked &quot;why do you now repudiate the nominee of that convention, the Honorable William Goebel?&quot; Hallam responded:

&quot;I admit,&quot; he stated blandly, &quot;that I said then what I now repeat, namely, that when the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yaller dog for the governorship of this great state, I will support him— but lower than that ye shall not drag me!&quot;

There are indications that the term was in widespread and easily understandable use by 1923. In a letter written in Huntland, Tennessee, by W. L. Moore of Kansas City, Missouri, on May 9, 1923, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, Moore writes:

I am a Democrat from inheritance, from prejudice and principle, if the principle suits me. But I have passed the yaller dog degree.

<text>The Uniklinikum Aachen, full German name &quot;Universitätsklinikum Aachen&quot; (&quot;University Hospital Aachen&quot;, abbreviated &quot;UKA&quot;), formerly known as &quot;Neues Klinikum&quot; (&quot;New Clinic&quot;), is the university hospital of the city of Aachen, Germany. It is part of the RWTH Aachen and contains its whole medical faculty.

In addition to wards and common hospital facilities such as laundry and sterilization units, the Uniklinikum Aachen houses educational and research facilities including specialized clinics, theoretical and clinical institutes, lecture halls and training rooms.

The hospital&#x27;s exterior and design is a prime example of High-tech architecture.

== History ==
In 1966 the RWTH Aachen school of medicine was founded. At that time, the municipal hospitals in Aachen became university hospitals, but soon it was realized that they were too small.

In 1972 the construction of the Klinikum Aachen began, with a project of Aachen architects Weber &amp; Brand. Ten years later, the first rooms could be used by the faculty. The rest of the building was finished section by section. The construction was delayed because of problems with soft ground that could not support the whole building.

The official opening was celebrated in 1985. Its original name was &quot;Neues Klinikum&quot; (&quot;New Clinic&quot;) because there was already a hospital called &quot;Klinikum&quot; in Aachen at that time; it does not exist anymore.

<doc id="248094" wikidata="Q653686" url="?curid=248094" title="North Petherton">
<text>North Petherton is a town and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated on the edge of the eastern foothills of the Quantocks, and close to the edge of the Somerset Levels.
The town has a population of 6,730 as of 2014. The parish includes Hamp, Melcombe, Shearston, Woolmersdon and Huntworth.

Dating from at least the 10th century and an important settlement in Saxon times,
North Petherton became a town only in the late 20th century, until then claiming to be the largest village in England.

A former market and administrative centre, North Petherton is now largely a dormitory town for workers in Bridgwater, 3 miles (5 km) to the north east, and Taunton, 8 miles (13 km) to the south west. The centre of the town is designated an &quot;Area of High Archaeological Potential&quot; (AHAP), and a number of buildings have been given listed building status.

==Toponymy==
The town is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Nortperet&quot;. The name derives from the area&#x27;s location to the north side of the River Parrett, and from the Old English &quot;nor&quot; &quot;tun&quot;.

==History==
Long before the Norman Conquest, during Saxon times North Petherton was at the centre of a large royal estate, located on one of the historic communication routes through Somerset, and was both an important centre and the meeting place for the Hundred of North Petherton although the &quot;Petherton limit&quot; tithing of North Petherton was in the Hundred of Andersfield from the 1670s.

At the time of the Norman invasion the Hundred covered a large area corresponding, today, roughly to a north–south corridor along the M5 motorway from Junction 25 near Taunton, to north of Junction 23 at Stretcholt, and east–west from Athelney to Goathurst. The Parish of North Petherton continues to be one of the largest in Somerset to this day.

===North Petherton Park===
King Henry II expanded the royal estate into the Royal Forest (hunting ground) of Petherton Park, which continued to exist until the 17th century. Geoffrey Chaucer (~1343–1400), author of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was appointed Deputy Forester of the Royal Forest of North Petherton towards the end of his life. The Royal Forest was probably similar in area to the Saxon Hundred of North Petherton. According to the late 13th century Hundred Rolls, King Henry II of England (died 1189) gave William of Wrotham lands at North Petherton. Between 1513 and 1535 Sir William Courtenay (d.1535) of Powderham, Devon was the keeper of North Petherton Park.

===Other===
The town itself it thought to have developed around the minster which, it is supposed, was on the same site as the current church. There is archaeological evidence indicating that there were timber buildings to the west of the church in the late Saxon period, and it is suspected that the remains of the Saxon settlement may continue to lie beneath the town centre. Excavations to the west of the church, on what is now the Community Centre site, revealed a 14th-century cemetery, which may have been used for victims of the plague, as well as indicating that the area was redeveloped in the late Middle Ages. It is thought that there may have been a mint in the town during the 10th or 11th century, and a charter to hold a market was granted in 1318, although it is thought that the market predated this. A shire hall, courthouse and guildhall are known to have exited and were probably located north of the church.

A minor skirmish of the English Civil War took place in August 1644 outside what was then the cornhill, now the area of Fore Street between the Community Centre and the former George Inn.

The Alfred Jewel, an object about long, made of filigree gold, cloisonné-enamelled and with a rock crystal covering, was found in 1693 at Petherton Park, North Petherton.
Believed to have been commissioned by Alfred the Great, it is thought to have been the handle for a pointer that would have fitted into the hole at its base, and been used while reading a book out loud. It is inscribed, &quot;AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN,&quot; (&quot;Alfred had me made&quot;). It may be one of the &quot;aestels&quot; Alfred had sent to each bishopric with a copy of his translation of Pope Gregory the Great&#x27;s book &quot;Pastoral Care&quot;. A replica of the jewel can be found in the church of St Mary.

When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was opened in 1827 it joined the River Parrett by a lock at Huntworth, where a basin was constructed, but in 1841 the canal was extended to a floating harbour in Bridgwater, and the Huntworth link was filled in. The canal and river were not re-connected at this point when the canal was restored, because the Parrett is by then a salt water river laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for Bridgwater&#x27;s population. The Crossways Swing Bridge over the canal in the parish was built in 1827 by John Rennie. It is a wooden bridge which rotated on steel ball-bearings in a circular track, a very early example of the use of ball bearings in this way. It was designated as a Grade II listed building but the mechanism was removed in 1987. The Higher and Lower Maunsel locks on the canal are either side of the Maunsel bridge which carries the A361. The stone Coxhill road bridge dates from the same time.

Woolmersdon House in Woolmersdon is a Grade II listed late Georgian residence.

In 1906, North Petherton became the first town in Britain (and perhaps the only one) to have street lights lit by piped acetylene gas, supplied by the &quot;North Petherton Gas and Carbide Company&quot;, operating from a plant in Mill Lane (photo). The plant was demolished towards the end of the 20th century to form a car park for the local doctor&#x27;s surgery. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, as well as by the provision of an electricity supply, and the Gas and Carbide Company was wound up. The &quot;North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company&quot; (dating from at least 1898) may have supplied gas to the adjacent church prior to the Gas and Carbide Company.

In 1926 the Bridgwater Beam Wireless Station was opened north east of the town. It was the UK receiving station for Marconi&#x27;s UK-to-Canada Beam Wireless Service, (part of the Imperial Wireless Chain,) the first transoceanic shortwave wireless telegraph service in the world and operated until 2002.

In 1984 North Petherton was provided with a small public library. As a result of a revitalised fund-raising campaign (originally begun decades earlier), this was followed a few years later by the construction of a Community Centre, opened in 1987, which was extended in 1991.

==Governance==
The civil parish of North Petherton includes the villages of North Newton (on the route of the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal) and Northmoor Green (also known as Moorland) in the Somerset Levels, as well as a number of other smaller settlements. Despite several reductions in size, with land redesignated to neighbouring parishes, North Petherton remains one of the largest parishes in Somerset at , and the largest in Sedgemoor.

The town council (which is a parish council) has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the town comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District. Fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

An electoral ward exists with the same name. Although &quot;North Petherton&quot; is the most populous area the ward stretches west to Broomfield and east to Lyng. In the north the ward adjoins Bridgwater. The total population for this ward as at the 2011 census was 7,155.

It is also part of the Bridgwater county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Geography==
North Petherton is situated on one of the historic communication routes through Somerset, and a turnpike through the town was opened between Bridgwater and Taunton in the 1730s. The opening of the nearby M5 motorway in the 1970s which relieved major traffic jams on the A38 through the town, also added to the attraction of the town for commuters and has consequently led to the construction of several new housing estates. The town lies on the route of the Macmillan Way West long-distance footpath.

South east of the town near Lyng, on the opposite side of the M5 motorway but within the parish is North Moor, a 676.3 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. North Moor is a nationally important grazing marsh and ditch system on the Somerset Levels and Moors. A range of neutral grassland types supporting common and scarce plants has developed mainly due to variations in soils and management practices. Aquatic plant communities are exceptionally diverse with good populations of nationally scarce species. The site has special interest in its bird life.

Along with the rest of South West England, North Petherton has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Economy==

North Petherton used to be a market town, with the right to hold a market having been granted in 1318, along with the right to an annual fair.

In the past the town hosted a &quot;Starkey Knight and Ford&quot; brewery on Fore Street (demolished in the late 1960s), several maltings, a light engineering works (Trig Engineering, since moved to the Huntworth Business Park adjacent to the nearby Junction 24 of the M5 motorway), and in earlier times at least 7 watermills.

Basket making and the manufacture of associated products including wicker furniture, was also a significant industry, at one time employing over 100 people in small factories and homes, until its decline in the second half of the 20th century. The products were distributed nationally via the railway station at Bridgwater. Nearby King&#x27;s Cliff formerly provided a source of building stone for the town dating from at least Medieval times. The production of cloth and leather goods also used to take place in the town, the former being commemorated in the name of the road known as Dyer&#x27;s Green.

The extensive cider orchards that used to surround much of the town in the 19th century had largely disappeared by the end of the 20th, by which time local employment was largely restricted to service businesses and farming. Folly Foot fishery is based on a lake which is stocked with Koi, Mirror, Common and Ghost Carp.

A new £100 m Regional Agricultural Business Centre, including an extensive Cattle Market and Dairy opened just beyond the outskirts of the town in 2007, following construction which began in 2006. This replaced the cattle markets in both Taunton and Bridgwater.

==Education==

North Petherton has two schools, North Petherton juniors and North Petherton infants, however they have been joined together to form one school, North Petherton Primary School.

Secondary schools in nearby Bridgwater include: Robert Blake Science College, Brymore School, Chilton Trinity School, East Bridgwater Community School which was previously known as Sydenham School and is a Performing and Visual Arts College, and Haygrove School which has specialist Language College status. Special schools in the town include: Elmwood Special School, New Horizon Centre School and Penrose School.

Further Education is provided by Bridgwater College which was formerly Bridgwater Technical School.

==Religious sites==

The town has the minster church of St Mary the Virgin, with a highly decorated tower which, at 112 feet (34 metres) high, is claimed to be one of the tallest towers in the West Country. The building is mainly dated from the 15th century, with a minstrel gallery from 1623, a peal of six bells, and a clock built in Bridgwater in 1807. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

The Church of St Peter has a tower which may be of Saxon origin which was altered in 1635. The rest of the church was completely rebuilt for Rev. Thomas Eaton in 1885. It is Grade II* listed.

The Church of St. Michael has Norman origins and has seen various restorations since. It was last restored and extended in 1868 for Slade family of Maunsel House.

In the cemetery is a 19th-century combined Non-conformist and Anglican Mortuary Chapel.
==Culture==
The annual &quot;North Petherton Carnival&quot; is part of the West Country Carnival circuit, and takes place in November, on the second Saturday in November. The date of the first Carnival at Bridgwater is the previous Saturday, featuring most of the same participants.

The Walnut Tree (rebranded in the 1970s from the Clarence Hotel, and before that as the New Inn) is one of three hotels in the town, it was formerly in competition with the George Hotel (now closed), where monthly petty sessions (court hearings) were formerly held. The hotel is also used as the Headquarters for Pentathlon Carnival Club, one of the carnival clubs which class North Petherton as its local carnival.

==Twinning==
North Petherton has been twinned with the commune of Ceaucé in Normandy, France since 1994.

<text>Dominic Bernard Patrick Luke Monaghan (born 8 December 1976) is a British-Irish actor. He is best known for playing Meriadoc &quot;Merry&quot; Brandybuck in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (2001–2003), and Charlie Pace on the ABC television drama &quot;Lost&quot; (2004–2010).

Monaghan first gained fame as Hetty Wainthropp&#x27;s sidekick Geoffrey in &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; (1996–1998). His first film role was as Sasha in the television film &quot;Hostile Waters&quot; (1997) based on the true story of a Soviet and a US submarine colliding in the Cold War. His other film roles include playing the young mutant Chris Bradley formerly known as Maverick in the superhero film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; (2009) and playing Beaumont Kin in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), reuniting with J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of &quot;Lost.&quot; He also has hosted the nature programme &quot;Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan&quot; (2012–2016).

== Early life ==
Monaghan was born in West Berlin, West Germany, to British parents: Maureen, a nurse, and Austin Monaghan, a science teacher of Irish descent. Monaghan&#x27;s family lived in Berlin, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart and Münster, moving about every four years. When he was about 11 years old, his family moved to Heaton Moor in Stockport, England. In Stockport, he attended St Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School (where his uncle taught and later became head teacher) and Aquinas College, where he studied English literature, drama and geography.

== Career ==
Although Monaghan held many occupations when he was younger, he long wanted to be an actor. After his second year at St Anne&#x27;s, Monaghan became a regular in school plays such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; before joining the Manchester Youth Theatre. There, he was scouted for &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;, in which he starred alongside Patricia Routledge and Derek Benfield as Hetty&#x27;s under-aged sidekick, Geoffrey Shawcross, for four series. Monaghan has since credited Routledge as &quot;an amazing teacher&quot; who taught him some &quot;very valuable lessons&quot; that have influenced his acting career. He made his feature-film debut as Russian sailor Sasha in the TV film &quot;Hostile Waters&quot;.

Monaghan later starred in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy as Meriadoc Brandybuck, for which he achieved international acclaim and success. Monaghan narrated &quot;&quot;, a documentary about &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; fandom. He also provided the narration for The Discovery Channel&#x27;s documentary &quot;Devil&#x27;s Bible&quot; in 2008. He also appeared in &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; alongside Sean Bean and Christian Slater.
He was a regular cast member on the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot; from 2004 to 2007, playing English former rockstar and drug addict Charlie Pace. Monaghan originally auditioned for the role of Sawyer. The role of Charlie was then changed from an old, washed up rocker from the 1980s, to a young one-hit wonder to accommodate Monaghan&#x27;s age. Monaghan returned to the series as a special guest star after departing from the main cast.

In 2009, Monaghan starred as Chris Bradley / Bolt in &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. On 15 July 2009, it was confirmed that he would join the cast of ABC Studios&#x27; science-fiction television series &quot;FlashForward&quot; as the character Simon. The series premiered on 24 September 2009. It was cancelled after its first season.

On 18 March 2010, Monaghan was spotted at the Universal Sheraton filming a short titled &quot;Gloria&quot;. It was part of a programme titled REESES Puff&#x27;s Extraordinary Cinema (where the teenagers replace the pros). He played the part of Caleb Reese.

In 2010, Monaghan and US actress Megan Fox made an appearance as a couple in an abusive relationship in the music video for Rihanna and Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Love the Way You Lie&quot;. Scenes include the celebrities on top of a liquor store. Fox and Monaghan also filmed inside the store and &quot;at a seedy dive bar next door&quot; to the store.

In November 2012, a new show on Channel 5 titled &quot;Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan&quot; started airing in the United Kingdom. The documentary shows Monaghan travelling to different locations such as Venezuela and Ecuador to film and interact with the exotic and often dangerous local wildlife.

During the summer of 2013, Monaghan appeared in various live-action teasers for 2K Marin&#x27;s science-fiction video game &quot;The Bureau: XCOM Declassified&quot;.

Monaghan is a fan of &quot;The Gaffer Tapes: Fantasy Football Podcast&quot; and has appeared as a guest between April–November 2016, as well as May 2018, and submitted several audio questions which are played on the podcast. While appearing as a guest, Monaghan said &quot;It&#x27;s the best fantasy football podcast out there&quot;.

Monaghan is a contributing writer for the music and culture magazine &quot;Paste&quot;, primarily writing articles about Premier League football.

Monaghan is the voice of Sightseeing Manchester&#x27;s bus tour, recorded in March 2016.

Since August 2018, he has been starring as a serial killer in Channel 9 Australia&#x27;s murder-mystery/drama TV series &quot;Bite Club&quot;, which is filmed in and around Sydney.

He was named as part of the cast for the last film in the sequel trilogy which is &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, reuniting with J.J. Abrams, a co-creator of &quot;Lost&quot;. He appeared as Beaumont.

In May 2020, Monaghan joined with fellow &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; castmates, along with writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson, to appear on Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart,&quot; which reunites the cast of popular films through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities. Monaghan and castmate Billy Boyd started the podcast &quot;The Friendship Onion&quot;, where they talk about their time filming &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

He made his stage debut in 2024 with &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; castmate Boyd in the Canadian production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Monaghan is a nature-lover and has been active in the planting of trees and cacti. He bought a mango-tree forest in India. Monaghan has a great love for insects and reptiles that he developed during his childhood, and has kept an exotic assortment of pets, including a leaf-mantis named Gizmo, a black widow spider named Witchitar and an albino snake named Blink. The species of spider is named after him.

An avid outdoorsman, Monaghan enjoys activities such as surfing, kayaking, snowboarding, football, basketball and hiking. He has also explained that he likes hunting for insects and reptiles outdoors. He learned karate as a child, used to practise yoga and often goes to the gym for strength and weight training. He is a longtime fan of Manchester United since his childhood.

Monaghan loves playing all games and has hosted game nights for fellow cast members in the past, and is also fond of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ crossword puzzle. He enjoys playing &quot;League of Legends&quot; with fellow &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; cast member Billy Boyd. He is fluent in German.

On his right arm he has a tattoo of the English word &quot;nine&quot; written in the artificial script of Tengwar, a reference to his involvement in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the fact that his character was one of the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven other cast members and John Rhys-Davies&#x27; stunt double also got matching tattoos during the film&#x27;s production, at Monaghan&#x27;s instigation. Below that tattoo is another that reads, &quot;Life imitates art&quot;, an Oscar Wilde quote. On his left arm is a tattoo, &quot;Living is easy with eyes closed&quot;, a line from The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. He also has two stars tattooed on his left foot: one black, and one white. In 2010, Monaghan got two more tattoos, one on the upper side of the back (&quot;Love you take is equal to the love you make&quot;, taken from the song &quot;The End&quot; by The Beatles). The other, done by Kat Von D on the reality TV series &quot;LA Ink&quot;, is located on his lower right arm and reads &quot;Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter&quot;, a quote from Yoda.

He resides in Los Angeles, California. In 2008, Monaghan held a photographic exhibition in Los Angeles in which he sold prints of his own works. A portion of the proceeds from the exhibition were given to an orangutan rescue organisation.

Monaghan was in a relationship with his &quot;Lost&quot; co-star Evangeline Lilly from 2004 until 2007.

In June 2008, Monaghan travelled to Argentina with Lilly to film the pilot of the US version of &quot;CQC&quot;.

Monaghan provided the inspiration for the naming of Billy Boyd&#x27;s band Beecake after he sent his friend a picture of a cake covered in bees.

In 2024, Monaghan announced he had obtained Irish citizenship.

<doc id="248097" wikidata="Q17144448" url="?curid=248097" title="Indescribable cardinal">
<text>In set theory, a branch of mathematics, a Q-indescribable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number that is hard to axiomatize in some language &quot;Q&quot;. There are many different types of indescribable cardinals corresponding to different choices of languages &quot;Q&quot;. They were introduced by .

A cardinal number formula_1 is called formula_2-indescribable if for every formula_3 proposition formula_4, and set formula_5 with formula_6 there exists an formula_7 with formula_8. Following Lévy&#x27;s hierarchy, here one looks at formulas with m-1 alternations of quantifiers with the outermost quantifier being universal. formula_9-indescribable cardinals are defined in a similar way, but with an outermost existential quantifier. Prior to defining the structure formula_10, one new predicate symbol is added to the language of set theory, which is interpreted as formula_11. The idea is that formula_1 cannot be distinguished (looking from below) from smaller cardinals by any formula of n+1-th order logic with m-1 alternations of quantifiers even with the advantage of an extra unary predicate symbol (for A). This implies that it is large because it means that there must be many smaller cardinals with similar properties. 

The cardinal number formula_1 is called totally indescribable if it is formula_2-indescribable for all positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

If formula_15 is an ordinal, the cardinal number formula_1 is called formula_15-indescribable if for every formula formula_4 and every subset formula_19 of formula_20 such that formula_21 holds in formula_22 there is a some formula_23 such that formula_24 holds in formula_25. If formula_15 is infinite then formula_15-indescribable ordinals are totally indescribable, and if formula_15 is finite they are the same as formula_29-indescribable ordinals. There is no formula_1 that is formula_1-indescribable, nor does formula_15-indescribability necessarily imply formula_33-indescribability for any formula_34, but there is an alternative notion of shrewd cardinals that makes sense when formula_35: if formula_36 holds in formula_22, then there are formula_23 and formula_33 such that formula_40 holds in formula_41. However, it is possible that a cardinal formula_42 is formula_1-indescribable for formula_1 much greater than formula_42.Ch. 9, theorem 4.3

==Historical note==

Originally, a cardinal κ was called Q-indescribable if for every Q-formula formula_4 and relation formula_11, if formula_48 then there exists an formula_7 such that formula_50. Using this definition, formula_1 is formula_52-indescribable iff formula_1 is regular and greater than formula_54.p.207 The cardinals formula_1 satisfying the above version based on the cumulative hierarchy were called strongly Q-indescribable. This property has also been referred to as &quot;ordinal formula_56-indescribability&quot;.p.32

==Equivalent conditions==

A cardinal is formula_57-indescribable iff it is formula_58-indescribable. A cardinal is inaccessible if and only if it is formula_59-indescribable for all positive integers formula_60, equivalently iff it is formula_61-indescribable, equivalently if it is formula_62-indescribable.

formula_63-indescribable cardinals are the same as weakly compact cardinals.p. 59

The indescribability condition is equivalent to formula_20 satisfying the reflection principle (which is provable in ZFC), but extended by allowing higher-order formulae with a second-order free variable.

For cardinals formula_65, say that an elementary embedding formula_66 a &quot;small embedding&quot; if formula_67 is transitive and formula_68. For any natural number formula_69, formula_1 is formula_58-indescribable iff there is an formula_72 such that for all formula_73 there is a small embedding formula_74 such that formula_75., Corollary 4.3

If V=L, then for a natural number &quot;n&quot;&gt;0, an uncountable cardinal is Π-indescribable iff it&#x27;s (n+1)-stationary.

==Enforceable classes==
For a class formula_76 of ordinals and a formula_77-indescribable cardinal formula_1, formula_76 is said to be enforced at formula_15 (by some formula formula_4 of formula_77) if there is a formula_77-formula formula_4 and an formula_5 such that formula_86, but for no formula_34 with formula_88 does formula_89 hold.p.277 This gives a tool to show necessary properties of indescribable cardinals.

==Properties==

The property of formula_1 being formula_58-indescribable is formula_92 over formula_20, i.e. there is a formula_92 sentence that formula_20 satisfies iff formula_1 is formula_58-indescribable. For formula_98, the property of being formula_99-indescribable is formula_100 and the property of being formula_100-indescribable is formula_99. Thus, for formula_98, every cardinal that is either formula_104-indescribable or formula_105-indescribable is both formula_99-indescribable and formula_100-indescribable and the set of such cardinals below it is stationary. The consistency strength of formula_100-indescribable cardinals is below that of formula_99-indescribable, but for formula_98 it is consistent with ZFC that the least formula_100-indescribable exists and is above the least formula_99-indescribable cardinal (this is proved from consistency of ZFC with formula_99-indescribable cardinal and a formula_100-indescribable cardinal above it).

Totally indescribable cardinals remain totally indescribable in the constructible universe and in other canonical inner models, and similarly for formula_99- and formula_100-indescribability.

For natural number formula_60, if a cardinal formula_1 is formula_60-indescribable, there is an ordinal formula_7 such that formula_121, where formula_122 denotes elementary equivalence. For formula_123 this is a biconditional (see Two model-theoretic characterisations of inaccessibility).

Measurable cardinals are formula_124-indescribable, but the smallest measurable cardinal is not formula_125-indescribable.p. 61 However, assuming choice, there are many totally indescribable cardinals below any measurable cardinal.

For formula_126, ZFC+&quot;there is a formula_127-indescribable cardinal&quot; is equiconsistent with ZFC+&quot;there is a formula_127-indescribable cardinal formula_1 such that formula_130&quot;, i.e. &quot;GCH fails at a formula_127-indescribable cardinal&quot;.

<text>The Apple IIGS (styled as II) is a 16-bit personal computer produced by Apple Computer beginning in September 1986. It is the fifth and most powerful model of the Apple II family. The &quot;GS&quot; in the name stands for &quot;Graphics and Sound&quot;, referring to its enhanced multimedia hardware, especially the state-of-the-art audio. It is compatible with earlier Apple II models, and Apple initially sold a kit for converting an Apple IIe into a IIGS.

The system is a radical departure otherwise, with a WDC 65C816 microprocessor, 256 KB or 1 MB of random-access memory expandable to 8 MB, resolution and color similar to the Amiga and Atari ST, and a 32 channel Ensoniq wavetable synthesis chip. Bundled with a mouse, it is the first computer from Apple with a color graphical user interface (color was introduced on the Macintosh II six months later) and the Apple Desktop Bus interface for keyboards, mice, and other input devices.

The IIGS blurred the lines between the Apple II and Macintosh. After releasing the IIGS, Apple chose to focus on the Mac and no new Apple IIGS models were released. The standard RAM was doubled to 512 KB in 1988, then to 1 MB in 1989, and there were two firmware updates. Apple ceased IIGS production on December 4, 1992.

== Hardware ==
The Apple IIGS made significant improvements over the Apple IIe and Apple IIc. It emulates its predecessors via a custom chip called the Mega II and uses the then-new WDC 65C816 16-bit microprocessor. The processor runs at , which is faster than the 8-bit processors used in the earlier Apple II models. The 65C816 allows the IIGS to address considerably more RAM. The original 65C816 processor used in the IIGS was certified to run at up to . Faster versions of the 65C816 processor were readily available, with speeds of between 5 and 14 MHz, but Apple kept the machine at 2.8 MHz throughout its production run.

Its graphical capabilities are superior to the rest of the Apple II series, with higher resolution video modes and more color. These include a 640×200-pixel mode with 2-bit color depth and a 320×200 mode with 4-bit color, both of which can select 4 or 16 colors (respectively) at a time from a palette of 4,096 colors. By changing the palette per scan line, it is possible to display 3,200 colors at once.

Audio is generated by a Ensoniq 5503 digital synthesizer chip with 32 channels of sound. These channels can be paired to produce 15 voices in stereo. There is 64 KB of dedicated RAM for use by the 5503.
The IIGS supports both 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch floppy disks and has seven general-purpose expansion slots compatible with those on the Apple II, II+, and IIe. It also has a memory expansion slot for up to 8 MB of RAM. The IIGS has ports for external floppy disk drives, two serial ports for devices such as printers and modems (which can also be used to connect to a LocalTalk network), an Apple Desktop Bus port to connect the keyboard and mouse, and composite and RGB video ports.

A real-time clock is maintained by a built-in battery (initially a non-replaceable 3.6-volt lithium battery; removable in a later-revision motherboard).

The IIGS also supports booting from an AppleShare server, via the AppleTalk protocol, over LocalTalk cabling. This was over a decade before NetBoot offered the same capability to computers running Mac OS 8 and beyond.

=== Graphics ===

In addition to supporting all the text and bitmapped Apple II graphics modes of earlier models, the Apple IIGS&#x27;s Video Graphics Chip (VGC) introduced a new &quot;Super-High Resolution&quot; mode with a vastly wider color palette and no color bleeding and fringing. Super-High-Resolution supports 200 lines, in either 320 or 640 pixels horizontally. Both modes use a 12-bit palette for a total of 4,096 possible colors. There can be between 4 and 3,200 colors onscreen at once, with no more than 16 per line. A &quot;fill mode&quot; setting allowing fast solid-fill graphics by automatically repeating a pixel&#x27;s color to the right along the same scan line—until a different color pixel is reached.

Each row of the display can independently select either 320 or 640 pixels, fill mode (320 pixels only), and any of the 16 palettes. These settings provide many possibilities:

* 320×200 pixels with a single palette of 16 colors.
* 320×200 pixels with up to 16 palettes of 16 colors. The VGC holds 16 separate palettes of 16 colors in its own memory. Each of the 200 scan lines can be assigned any one of these palettes, allowing for up to 256 colors on the screen at once.
* 320×200 pixels with up to 200 palettes of 16 colors. The CPU assists the VGC in swapping palettes into and out of the video memory so that each scan line can have its own palette of 16 colors, allowing for up to 3,200 colors on the screen at once.
* 320×200 pixels with 15 colors per palette, plus a fill-mode color. Color 0 in the palette is replaced by the last non-zero color pixel displayed on the scan line (to the left).
* 640×200 pixels with 4 pure colors.
* 640×200 pixels with up to 16 palettes of 4 pure colors. The VGC holds 16 separate palettes of 4 pure colors in its own memory. Each of the 200 scan lines can be assigned any one of these palettes, allowing for up to 64 colors on the screen at once.
* 640x200 pixels with up to 200 palettes of 4 pure colors. The CPU assists the VGC in swapping palettes into and out of the video memory so that each scan line can have its own palette of 4 colors, allowing for up to 800 colors on the screen at once.
* 640×200 pixels with 16 dithered colors. Two palettes of four pure colors each are used in alternating columns. The hardware then dithers the colors of adjacent pixels to create 16 total colors on the screen.

=== Audio ===

The Apple IIGS&#x27;s sound is provided by an Ensoniq 5503 DOC (Digital Oscillator Chip) wavetable synthesis chip designed by Bob Yannes, creator of the SID synthesizer chip used in the Commodore 64. The ES5503 DOC is the same chip used in Ensoniq Mirage and Ensoniq ESQ-1 professional-grade synthesizers. The chip has 32 oscillators, which allows for a maximum of 32 voices (with limited capabilities when all used independently), though Apple&#x27;s firmware pairs them for 16 voices, to produce fuller and more flexible sound, as do most of the standard tools of the operating system (the Apple MIDISynth toolset goes even a step further for richer sound, grouping four oscillators per voice, for a limit of seven-voice audio). The IIGS is often referred to as a 15-voice system, because one voice, or &quot;sound generator&quot; consisting of two oscillators, is always reserved as a dedicated clock for the sound chip&#x27;s timing interrupt generator. Software that does not use the system firmware, or uses custom-programmed tools (certain games, demos, and music software), can access the chip directly and take advantage of all 32 voices.

A standard -inch headphone jack is on the back of the case, and standard stereo computer speakers can be attached there. This jack provides only monaural sound and a third-party adapter card is required for stereo; despite that, the Ensoniq and virtually all native software produces stereo audio. The Ensoniq can drive 16 speaker output channels, but the Molex expansion connector Apple provided only allows 8. There is 64 KB of dedicated memory (DOC-RAM) on the IIGS motherboard, separate from system memory, for the Ensoniq chip to store its sampled wavetable instruments.

To exploit the IIGS&#x27;s audio capabilities, during its introduction, Apple sold Bose Roommate amplified speakers for the computer (matching its platinum color and with custom Bose/Apple logo grille covers).

=== Expansion ===
Like other Apple II machines before it, the IIGS is highly expandable. The expansion slots can be used for a variety of purposes, greatly increasing the computer&#x27;s capabilities. SCSI host adapters can be used to connect external SCSI devices such as hard drives and CD-ROM drives. Other mass-storage devices such as adapters supporting more recent internal 2.5-inch IDE hard drives can also be used. Another common class of Apple IIGS expansion cards is accelerator cards, such as Applied Engineering&#x27;s TransWarp GS, replacing the computer&#x27;s original processor with a faster one. A more recent expansion option, the AppleSqueezer GS, combines an accelerator with adjustable speeds up to 14 MHz, 14MB RAM (240MB with drivers), and HDMI output all in a single package. Applied Engineering developed the PC Transporter, which is essentially an IBM-PC/XT on a card. A variety of other cards were also produced, including ones allowing new technologies such as 10BASE-T Ethernet and CompactFlash cards to be used on the IIGS. One such CompactFlash card expansion is ReActiveMicro’s MicroDrive/Turbo, presenting a DMA-enabled, notably fast solid-state storage alternative for the majority of the Apple II series, including the Apple II, II+, IIe, and IIGS. Another new expansion card is the Uthernet II, an Ethernet device for the Apple II series. The primary uses of the Uthernet II are data transfers (often over ADTPro) and BBS access. It can also be used for extremely basic web-browsing and other networking purposes.

== Development ==
Steve Wozniak said in January 1985 that Apple was investigating the 65816, and that an 8 MHz version would &quot;beat the pants off a 68000 in most applications&quot;, but any product using it would have to be compatible with the Apple II. Rumors spread about his work on an &quot;Apple IIx&quot;. The IIx was said to have a 16-bit CPU, one megabyte of RAM, and better graphics and sound. &quot;IIx&quot; was the code name for Apple&#x27;s first internal project to develop a next-generation Apple II based on the 65816. The IIx project, though, became bogged down when it attempted to include various coprocessors allowing it to emulate other computer systems. Early samples of the 65816 were also problematic. These problems led to the cancellation of the IIx project, but later, a new project was formed to produce an updated Apple II. This project, which led to the released IIGS, was known by various codenames while the new system was being developed, including &quot;Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot;, &quot;Gumby&quot;, and &quot;Cortland&quot;. There were rumors of several vastly enhanced prototypes built over the years at Apple but none were ever released. Only one, the &quot;Mark Twain&quot;, has been revealed so far. The Mark Twain prototype (named for Twain&#x27;s famous quote &quot;The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated&quot;) was expected to have the &quot;ROM 04&quot; revision (although prototypes that have been discovered do not contain any new ROM code) and featured an 8 MHz 65C816, built-in SuperDrive, 2 MB of RAM, and a hard drive.

Some design features from the unsuccessful Apple III lived on in the Apple IIGS, such as GS/OS borrowing elements from SOS (including, by way of ProDOS, the SOS file system), a unique keyboard feature for dual-speed arrow keys, and colorized ASCII text.

== Release ==

=== Limited Edition (&quot;Woz&quot;-signed case) ===
As part of a commemorative celebration marking the 10th anniversary of the Apple II series&#x27; development, as well as Apple Computer itself celebrating the same anniversary, a special limited edition was introduced at product launch. The first 50,000 Apple IIGSs manufactured had a reproduced copy of Wozniak&#x27;s signature (&quot;Woz&quot;) at the front right corner of the case, with a dotted line and the phrase &quot;Limited Edition&quot; printed just below it. Owners of the Limited Edition, after mailing in their Apple registration card, were mailed back a certificate of authenticity signed by Wozniak and 12 key Apple engineers, as well as a personal letter from Wozniak himself (both machine-reproduced). Because the difference between standard and Limited Edition machines was purely cosmetic, many owners of new were able to &quot;convert&quot; to the Limited Edition by merely swapping the case lid from an older (and likely nonfunctional) machine.

=== Upgrading an Apple IIe ===
Upon its release in September 1986, Apple announced it would be making a kit that would upgrade an Apple IIe to a IIGS available for purchase. This followed an Apple practice of making logic board upgrades available that dated from the earliest days of the Apple II until Steve Jobs&#x27; return to Apple in 1997. The IIe-to-IIGS upgrade replaced the IIe motherboard with a 16-bit IIGS motherboard. Users would take their Apple IIe machines into an authorized Apple dealership, where the IIe motherboard and lower baseboard of the case were swapped for an Apple IIGS motherboard with a new baseboard (with matching cut-outs for the new built-in ports). New metal sticker ID badges replaced those on the front of the IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker, and power supply. Original IIGS motherboards (those produced between 1986 and mid-1989) have electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half of those produced have the physical plug connectors factory-presoldered in, which were mostly reserved for the upgrade kits.
The upgrade cost US$500, plus the trade-in of the user&#x27;s existing Apple IIe motherboard. It did not include a mouse, and the keyboard, although functional, lacked a numeric keypad and did not mimic all the features and functions of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard. Some cards designed for the GS did not fit in the Apple IIe&#x27;s slanted case. In the end, most users found that the upgrade did not save them much money once they purchased a 3.5-inch floppy drive, analog RGB monitor, and mouse.

== Software features ==
Software that runs on the Apple IIGS can be divided into two major categories: 8-bit software compatible with earlier Apple II systems such as the IIe and IIc, and 16-bit IIGS software, which takes advantage of its advanced features, including a near-clone of the Macintosh graphical user interface.

=== 8-bit Apple II compatibility ===
Apple claimed that the IIGS was 95% compatible with contemporary Apple II software. One reviewer, for example, successfully ran demo programs that came on cassette with his 1977 Apple II. The IIGS can run all of Apple&#x27;s earlier Apple II operating systems: Apple DOS, ProDOS 8, and Apple Pascal. It is also compatible with nearly all 8-bit software running on those systems. Like the Apple II+, IIe, and IIc, the IIGS also includes Applesoft BASIC and a machine-language monitor (which can be used for very simple assembly language programming) in ROM, so they can be used even with no operating system loaded from disk. The 8-bit software runs twice as fast unless the user turns down the processor speed in the IIGS control panel.

=== System software ===
Early versions of the system software are based on the ProDOS 16 operating system, which is based on the original ProDOS operating system for 8-bit Apple II computers. Although it was modified so that 16-bit Apple IIGS software can run on it, ProDOS 16 was written largely in 8-bit code and does not take full advantage of the IIGS&#x27;s capabilities. Later System Software versions (starting with version 4.0) replaced ProDOS 16 with a new 16-bit operating system known as GS/OS. It makes better use of the unique capabilities of the IIGS and includes many valuable new features. The IIGS System Software was substantially enhanced and expanded over the years during which it was developed, culminating in its final official version, System 6.0.1, which was released in 1993. In July 2015, members of a computer group from France released a new, though unofficial, version of that System Software, dubbed &quot;System 6.0.2&quot; (and later followed by System 6.0.3 and 6.0.4), that primarily fixed some bugs.

=== Graphical user interface ===
Similar to the Mac, the IIGS provides a mouse-driven graphical user interface. This is implemented by a &quot;toolbox&quot; of code, some of which resides in the computer&#x27;s ROM and some of which is loaded from disk. Only one major application can run at a time, although other, smaller programs, known as Desk Accessories, can be used simultaneously. The IIGS has a Finder file manager application very similar to the Macintosh&#x27;s, which allows the user to manipulate files and launch applications. By default, the Finder is displayed when the computer starts up and whenever the user quits an application that is started from it, although the startup application can be changed by the user.

=== Multitasking ===
A third party UNIX-like multitasking kernel was produced, called GNO/ME, which runs under the GUI and provides preemptive multitasking. In addition, a system called &quot;The Manager&quot; can be used to make the Finder more like the one on the Macintosh, allowing major software (other than just the &quot;accessory&quot; programs) to run simultaneously through cooperative multitasking.

==Reception==
After previewing the computer, &quot;BYTE&quot; stated in October 1986 that &quot;The Apple IIGS designers&#x27; achievements are remarkable, but the burden of the classic Apple II architecture, now as venerable (and outdated) as COBOL and batch processing, may have weighed them down and denied them any technological leaps beyond an exercise in miniaturization.&quot; The magazine added that &quot;hog-tied by [classic] Apple II compatibility, [the IIGS] approaches but does not match or exceed current computer capabilities&quot; of the Macintosh, Amiga, or Atari ST, and predicted that many vendors would &quot;enhance existing products for the [classic] Apple II instead of writing new software&quot; that fully exploited the IIGS&#x27;s power.

&quot;inCider&quot;, which in September had warned that the next Apple II &quot;needs (at least)... a megabyte of RAM... That&#x27;s what the market wants&quot;, indeed reported in November that &quot;Rather than risk investing time and money in programs that work only on the Apple IIGS, a number of software developers have simply upgraded old Apple II programs&quot;, and that the &quot;most interesting program available specifically for the IIGS at this time is LearningWays&#x27; Explore-a-Story, which was released simultaneously for the good old 128K Apple IIe and IIc&quot;. The magazine concluded, &quot;The moral is simple: Good hardware, even innovative hardware, won&#x27;t give birth to good, new software overnight.&quot;

&quot;Nibble&quot; was more positive, calling the price &quot;fantastic&quot; for &quot;Steve Wozniak&#x27;s dream machine&quot;. It praised the IIGS&#x27;s &quot;incredible&quot; legacy Apple II compatibility, graphics, and sound, stated that only its slower speed made the computer significantly inferior to the Macintosh, and expected that Apple would soon introduce new products to better distinguish the two product lines. The magazine concluded that &quot;The IIGS is an incredibly fine computer, arguably the finest assemblage of chips and resistors ever soldered together... Ladies and gentlemen of Apple, on behalf of the Apple II user community, you have earned our gratitude and admiration.&quot;

&quot;Compute!&quot; described the IIGS in November 1986 as &quot;two machines in one—a product that bridges the gap between the Macintosh and Apple IIe, and in so doing poses what may be serious competition for the Commodore Amiga and the Atari ST series&quot;. It described the IIGS&#x27;s graphics &quot;as different as night and day&quot; from the earlier Apple IIs and the audio as &quot;in a class by themselves... [it] justifies the price of the IIGS to many music fans and fanatics&quot;. The magazine reported that &quot;well over one hundred outside developers were actively engaged in creating software for the IIGS&quot;, and predicted that &quot;as new products are developed to take advantage of the IIGS, people will move away from the pure Apple II and toward the newer titles with their improved performance&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Apple Applications&quot; in December 1987 reported, however, that &quot;Many publishers have canceled or postponed their plans for Apple IIGS software and instead are cautiously introducing programs for the Apple IIc and IIe&quot;, while &quot;many of the products for the Apple IIGS are simply versions of&quot; older Apple II software &quot;that incorporate color and use the mouse interface&quot;. So little IIGS software was available, it said, that &quot;the hottest product... is &quot;AppleWorks&quot;. No mouse interface, no color, no graphics. Just &quot;AppleWorks&quot; from the IIe and IIc world&quot;. The magazine stated that many customers either chose the slightly more expensive Macintosh Plus or kept their inexpensive IIc or IIe which ran AppleWorks well, with the IIGS &quot;in a strange position&quot; in between.

&quot;BYTE&quot;″s Bruce Webster in January 1987 praised Apple for permitting Wozniak to finish the IIx project, but said that the company should have done so &quot;a few years ago&quot;. The IIGS is an excellent replacement for the [earlier models from the] Apple II line, but it&#x27;s awfully late in coming. The technology is more trailing-edge than leading-edge in many areas&quot;, with speed and graphics inferior to that of the Amiga and Atari ST. The other computers, he wrote, have both larger software libraries that use their power and lower prices; Webster found that a IIGS package costing was comparable to a Atari ST configuration. He concluded with a &quot;qualified approval&quot; of the computer: &quot;It was necessary to prevent the Apple II line from dying off during the next year or so. However, Apple didn&#x27;t go far enough.&quot; A &quot;BYTE&quot; review in April 1987 concluded that the IIGS &quot;has the potential to be a powerful computer&quot; but needed a faster CPU and more addressable memory. The magazine advised potential customers to compare the Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST&#x27;s more powerful 68000 CPU with the IIGS&#x27;s greater expandability and large Apple II software library.

&quot;Compute!&quot; in 1988 urged Apple to make the computer faster, stating that &quot;no matter which way you cut it, the IIGS is slow&quot; and that IIGS-specific programs could not keep up with user actions. In 1989 the magazine stated &quot;One of the biggest complaints of IIGS-specific software is the way it imitates the pace of a zombie. You&#x27;d think 16-bit software had died and voodoo-transformed into a shuffling, stumbling imitation of real computer applications.&quot; It reported that year that after increases in September, a IIGS with color monitor, two disk drives, and ImageWriter II cost more than , a price the magazine called &quot;staggering&quot;. &quot;inCider&quot; also criticized the price increase, warning that it &quot;opens the door further to low-cost MS-DOS computers&quot;.

Some software companies complained that Apple did not provide technical information and development tools to create IIGS-specific software. In 1988 &quot;Compute!&quot; reported that both Cinemaware and Intergalactic Development had to write their own tools to maximize their use of IIGS audio, with the latter stating that &quot;these sorts of problems … are becoming well-known throughout the industry&quot;.

== Revision history ==
While in production between September 1986 and December 1992, the Apple IIGS remained relatively unchanged from its inception. During those years, however, Apple did produce some maintenance updates to the system which mainly comprised two new ROM-based updates and a revamped motherboard. It is rumored that several prototypes that greatly enhanced the machine&#x27;s features and capabilities were designed and even built, though only one has ever been publicly exposed (i.e. the &quot;Mark Twain&quot;). Outlined below are &quot;only&quot; those revisions and updates officially released by Apple.

=== Original firmware release (&quot;ROM version 00&quot;) ===
During the entire first year of the machine&#x27;s production, an early, almost beta-like, firmware version shipped with the machine and was notably bug-ridden. Some limitations of this include the fact that the built-in RAM Disk can&#x27;t be set larger than 4 MB (even if more RAM is present) and the firmware contains the very early System 1.x toolsets. It became incompatible with most native Apple IIGS software written from late-1987 onward, and OS support only lasted up to System 3. The startup splash screen of the original ROM only displays the words &quot;Apple IIgs&quot; at the top center of the screen, in the same fashion that previous Apple II models identify themselves.

=== Video Graphics Controller (VGC) replacement ===
Very early production runs of the machine had a faulty video graphics controller (VGC) chip that produced strange cosmetic glitches in emulated (IIe/IIc) video modes. Specifically, the 80-column text display and monochrome double-high-resolution graphics had a symptom wherein small flickering or static pink bits would appear between the gaps of characters and pixels. Most users noticed this when using AppleWorks classic or the Mousedesk application that was a part of System 1 and 2. Apple resolved the issue by offering a free chip-swap upgrade to affected owners.

=== Second firmware release (&quot;ROM version 01&quot;) ===
In August 1987, Apple released an updated ROM that was included in all new machines and was made available as a free upgrade to all existing owners. The main feature of the new ROM was the presence of the System 2.x toolsets and several bug fixes. The upgrade was vital, as software developers, including Apple, ceased support of the original ROM upon its release (most native Apple IIGS software written from late 1987 onwards would &quot;not&quot; run unless ROM 01 or higher was present, and this included the GS/OS operating system). This update also allows up to 8 MB for the RAM Disk, added some new features for programmers, and reported the ROM version and copyright information on the startup splash screen.

=== Standard RAM increased to 512 KB ===
In March 1988, Apple began shipping IIGS units with 512 KB of RAM as standard. This was done by preinstalling the Apple IIGS Memory Expansion Card (that was once sold separately) in the memory expansion slot—the card had 256 KB of RAM on board with empty sockets for further expansion. The built-in memory on the motherboard remained at 256 KB and existing users were not offered this upgrade.

=== Third firmware release (&quot;ROM version 3&quot;); 1 MB of RAM ===
In August 1989, Apple increased the standard amount of RAM shipped in the IIGS to 1.125 MB. This time the additional memory was built-in on the motherboard, which required a layout change and allowed for other minor improvements as well. This update introduced both a new motherboard and a new ROM firmware update; however, neither was offered to existing owners—even as an upgrade option (the new ROM, now two chips, is incompatible with the original single-socket motherboard). Apple had cited the reason an upgrade was not being offered was that most of the features of the new machine could be obtained in existing machines by installing System 5 and a fully populated Apple IIGS Memory Expansion Card.

The new ROM firmware was expanded to 256 KB and contained the System 5.x toolsets. The newer toolsets increased the performance of the machine by up to 10%, due to the fact that less had to be loaded from disk, tool ROM read access being faster than RAM, and their highly optimized routines compared to the older toolsets (pre-GS/OS-based). In addition to several bug fixes, also added were more programmer assistance commands and features, a cleaned-up control panel with improved mouse control and RAM Disk functionality, more flexible Appletalk support and slot-mapping.

In terms of hardware, the new motherboard is a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that interfered with the Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM is built-in, with double the ROM size, and an enhanced Apple Desktop Bus microcontroller provides native support for sticky keys, mouse emulation, and keyboard LED support (available on extended keyboards). Hardware shadowing of Text Page 2 was introduced, improving compatibility and performance with the classic Apple II video mode. The clock battery is now user-serviceable, being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based control panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple-IIe-to-IIGS upgrade was removed, and some cost-cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than being socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to this version of the IIGS as the &quot;ROM 3&quot;.

== International versions ==
Like the Apple IIe and Apple IIc built-in keyboards before it, the detached IIGS keyboard differs depending on what region of the world it was sold in, with extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on the Canadian IIGS keyboard such as &quot;à&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, etc., or the British Pound &quot;£&quot; symbol on the UK IIGS keyboard). Unlike previous Apple II models, however, the layout and shape of keys were the same standard for all countries, and the ROMs inside the computer were also the same for all countries, including support for all the different international keyboards. In order to access the local character set layout and display, users would change settings in the built-in software-based control panel, which also provides a method of toggling between 50/60 Hz video screen refresh. The composite video output is NTSC-only on all IIGS systems; users in PAL countries are expected to use an RGB monitor or TVs which featured RGB SCART. This selectable internationalization makes it quick and simple to localize any given machine. Also present in the settings is a QWERTY/DVORAK keyboard toggle for all countries, much like that of the Apple IIc. Outside North America, the Apple IIGS shipped with a different 220 V clip-in power supply, making this and the plastic keycaps the only physical differences (and also very modular, in the sense of converting a non-localized machine to a local one).

== Legacy ==
The Apple Desktop Bus, which for a long time was the standard for most input peripherals for the Macintosh, first appeared on the IIGS. In addition, the other standardized ports and addition of SCSI set a benchmark which allowed Apple, for the first time, to consolidate their peripheral offerings across both the Apple II and Macintosh product lines, permitting one device to be compatible with multiple, disparate computers.

The IIGS is also the first Apple product to bear the new brand-unifying color scheme, a warm gray color Apple dubbed &quot;Platinum&quot;. This color would remain the Apple standard used on the vast majority of products for the next decade. The IIGS is also the second major computer design, after the Apple IIc, where Apple worked with Hartmut Esslinger&#x27;s team at Frog Design. The consistent use of the new corporate color and matching peripherals ushered in the Snow White design language, which was used exclusively for the next five years and made the Apple product line instantly recognizable around the world.

The inclusion of a professional-grade sound chip in the Apple IIGS was hailed by both developers and users, and hopes were high that it would be added to the Macintosh; however, it drew another lawsuit from Apple Corps. As part of an earlier trademark dispute with the business arm of The Beatles, Apple Computer had agreed not to release music-related products. Apple Corps considered the inclusion of the Ensoniq chip in the IIGS a violation of that agreement.

=== Developers ===
John Carmack, co-founder of id Software, started his career by writing commercial software for the Apple IIGS, working with John Romero and Tom Hall. &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, based on the 1981 Apple II game &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, came full-circle when it was released for the Apple IIGS in 1998.

Two mainstream video games, &quot;Zany Golf&quot; and &quot;The Immortal&quot;, both designed by Will Harvey, originated as Apple IIGS games that were ported to other platforms, including the Sega Genesis.

Pangea Software started as an Apple IIGS game developer. Naughty Dog started with the classic Apple II machines, but later developed for the IIGS.

=== Gus ===
Apple designed the Apple IIe Card to transit Apple IIe customers to the Macintosh LC, particularly schools who had a large investment in Apple II software. While Apple discussed creating an LC plug-in IIGS card, they felt that the cost of selling it would be as much as an entire LC and abandoned it. However, the educational community had a substantial investment in the IIGS software as well, which made upgrading to a Macintosh a less attractive proposition than had been for the Apple IIe. As a result, Apple software designers Dave Lyons and Andy Nicholas spearheaded a program to develop a IIGS software emulator they called Gus in their spare time, which would run on the Power Macintosh only. Apple did not officially support the project. Nevertheless, seeing the need to help switch their educational customers to the Macintosh (as well as sell Power Macs), Apple unofficially distributed the software for free to schools and other institutions that signed a non-disclosure agreement. It was never offered for public sale, but is now readily available on the internet, along with many third-party classic Apple II emulators. Gus represents one of the few software emulators developed within Apple (officially or otherwise), including MacWorks and Mac OS X Classic environment. The app was publicly demonstrated in Rhapsody&#x27;s Blue Box at WWDC 1997.

== Rumors and canceled developments ==

In August 1988, &quot;inCider&quot; magazine reported Apple was working on a new Apple IIGS. It was stated it had a faster CPU, improved graphics (double the vertical resolution, 256 colors per scanline and 4,096 colors per screen), 768 KB of RAM, 256 KB of ROM, 128 KB of sound DOC-RAM and a built-in SCSI port. No new machine would appear that year.

In 1989 &quot;Compute!&quot; reported on speculation that Apple would announce at the May AppleFest a &quot;IIGS Plus&quot; with a processor two to three times faster, 768 KB to 1 MB RAM, and a SCSI port. The speculation was partially based on Apple CEO John Sculley stating that the IIGS would receive a new CPU in 1989. No new computer appeared, but in August, the IIGS started shipping with 1 MB RAM in the base configuration.

VTech, makers of the 8-bit Apple II-compatible Laser 128, announced plans for a IIGS-compatible computer in 1988 for under $600. They demonstrated a prototype in 1989, but the computer was never released.

Cirtech produced a working prototype of a black-and-white Macintosh hardware emulation plug-in card for the IIGS dubbed &quot;Duet&quot;. Using a 68020 processor, custom ROM and up to 8 MB RAM, Cirtech claimed it outperformed the Macintosh IIcx. The project was ultimately canceled due to the projected high cost of the board.

<text>In mathematics, a measurable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. In order to define the concept, one introduces a two-valued measure on a cardinal &quot;κ&quot;, or more generally on any set. For a cardinal &quot;κ&quot;, it can be described as a subdivision of all of its subsets into large and small sets such that &quot;κ&quot; itself is large, ∅ and all singletons {&quot;α&quot;} (with &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;κ&quot;) are small, complements of small sets are large and vice versa. The intersection of fewer than &quot;κ&quot; large sets is again large.

It turns out that uncountable cardinals endowed with a two-valued measure are large cardinals whose existence cannot be proved from ZFC.

The concept of a measurable cardinal was introduced by Stanisław Ulam in 1930.

== Definition ==
Formally, a measurable cardinal is an uncountable cardinal number &quot;κ&quot; such that there exists a &quot;κ&quot;-additive, non-trivial, 0-1-valued measure &quot;μ&quot; on the power set of &quot;κ.&quot;

Here, κ-additive means: For every &quot;λ&quot; &lt; &quot;κ&quot; and every &quot;λ&quot;-sized set {&quot;A&quot;&quot;β&quot;}&quot;β&quot;&lt;&quot;λ&quot; of pairwise disjoint subsets &quot;A&quot;&quot;β&quot; ⊆ &quot;κ,&quot; we have
:&quot;μ&quot;(⋃&quot;β&quot;&lt;&quot;λ&quot; &quot;A&quot;&quot;β&quot;) = Σ&quot;β&quot;&lt;&quot;λ&quot; &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot;&quot;β&quot;).

Equivalently, &quot;κ&quot; is a measurable cardinal if and only if it is an uncountable cardinal with a &quot;κ&quot;-complete, non-principal ultrafilter. This means that the intersection of any &quot;strictly less than&quot; &quot;κ&quot;-many sets in the ultrafilter, is also in the ultrafilter.

Equivalently, &quot;κ&quot; is measurable means that it is the critical point of a non-trivial elementary embedding of the universe &quot;V&quot; into a transitive class &quot;M&quot;. This equivalence is due to Jerome Keisler and Dana Scott, and uses the ultrapower construction from model theory. Since &quot;V&quot; is a proper class, a technical problem that is not usually present when considering ultrapowers needs to be addressed, by what is now called Scott&#x27;s trick.

== Properties ==
It is trivial to note that if &quot;κ&quot; admits a non-trivial &quot;κ&quot;-additive measure, then &quot;κ&quot; must be regular. (By non-triviality and &quot;κ&quot;-additivity, any subset of cardinality less than &quot;κ&quot; must have measure 0, and then by &quot;κ&quot;-additivity again, this means that the entire set must not be a union of fewer than &quot;κ&quot; sets of cardinality less than &quot;κ.&quot;) Finally, if &quot;λ&quot; &lt; &quot;κ,&quot; then it can&#x27;t be the case that &quot;κ&quot; ≤ 2&quot;λ&quot;. If this were the case, we could identify &quot;κ&quot; with some collection of 0-1 sequences of length &quot;λ.&quot; For each position in the sequence, either the subset of sequences with 1 in that position or the subset with 0 in that position would have to have measure 1. The intersection of these &quot;λ&quot;-many measure 1 subsets would thus also have to have measure 1, but it would contain exactly one sequence, which would contradict the non-triviality of the measure. Thus, assuming the Axiom of Choice, we can infer that &quot;κ&quot; is a strong limit cardinal, which completes the proof of its inaccessibility.

Although it follows from ZFC that every measurable cardinal is inaccessible (and is ineffable, Ramsey, etc.), it is consistent with ZF that a measurable cardinal can be a successor cardinal. It follows from ZF + AD that ω1 is measurable, and that every subset of ω1 contains or is disjoint from a closed and unbounded subset.

Ulam showed that the smallest cardinal &quot;κ&quot; that admits a non-trivial countably-additive two-valued measure must in fact admit a &quot;κ&quot;-additive measure. (If there were some collection of fewer than &quot;κ&quot; measure-0 subsets whose union was &quot;κ,&quot; then the induced measure on this collection would be a counterexample to the minimality of &quot;κ.&quot;) From there, one can prove (with the Axiom of Choice) that the least such cardinal must be inaccessible.

If &quot;κ&quot; is measurable and &quot;p&quot; ∈ &quot;V&quot;&quot;κ&quot; and &quot;M&quot; (the ultrapower of &quot;V&quot;) satisfies &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;κ, p&quot;), then the set of &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;κ&quot; such that &quot;V&quot; satisfies &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;α, p&quot;) is stationary in &quot;κ&quot; (actually a set of measure 1). In particular if &quot;ψ&quot; is a Π1 formula and &quot;V&quot; satisfies &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;κ, p&quot;), then &quot;M&quot; satisfies it and thus &quot;V&quot; satisfies &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;α, p&quot;) for a stationary set of &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;κ.&quot; This property can be used to show that &quot;κ&quot; is a limit of most types of large cardinals that are weaker than measurable. Notice that the ultrafilter or measure witnessing that &quot;κ&quot; is measurable cannot be in &quot;M&quot; since the smallest such measurable cardinal would have to have another such below it, which is impossible.

If one starts with an elementary embedding &quot;j&quot;1 of &quot;V&quot; into &quot;M&quot;1 with critical point &quot;κ,&quot; then one can define an ultrafilter &quot;U&quot; on &quot;κ&quot; as { &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;κ&quot; | &quot;κ&quot; ∈ &quot;j&quot;1(&quot;S&quot;) }. Then taking an ultrapower of &quot;V&quot; over &quot;U&quot; we can get another elementary embedding &quot;j&quot;2 of &quot;V&quot; into &quot;M&quot;2. However, it is important to remember that &quot;j&quot;2 ≠ &quot;j&quot;1. Thus other types of large cardinals such as strong cardinals may also be measurable, but not using the same embedding. It can be shown that a strong cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is measurable and also has &quot;κ&quot;-many measurable cardinals below it.

Every measurable cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is a 0-huge cardinal because &quot;κ&quot;&quot;M&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot;, that is, every function from &quot;κ&quot; to &quot;M&quot; is in &quot;M&quot;. Consequently, &quot;V&quot;&quot;κ&quot;+1 ⊆ &quot;M&quot;.

==Implications of existence==
If a measurable cardinal exists, every Σ (with respect to the analytical hierarchy) set of reals has a Lebesgue measure. In particular, any non-measurable set of reals must not be Σ.

== Real-valued measurable ==
A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called real-valued measurable if there is a &quot;κ&quot;-additive probability measure on the power set of &quot;κ&quot; that vanishes on singletons. Real-valued measurable cardinals were introduced by . showed that the continuum hypothesis implies that 𝔠 is not real-valued measurable. showed (see below for parts of Ulam&#x27;s proof) that real valued measurable cardinals are weakly inaccessible (they are in fact weakly Mahlo). All measurable cardinals are real-valued measurable, and a real-valued measurable cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is measurable if and only if &quot;κ&quot; is greater than 𝔠. Thus a cardinal is measurable if and only if it is real-valued measurable and strongly inaccessible. A real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to 𝔠 exists if and only if there is a countably additive extension of the Lebesgue measure to all sets of real numbers if and only if there is an atomless probability measure on the power set of some non-empty set.

 showed that existence of measurable cardinals in ZFC, real-valued measurable cardinals in ZFC, and measurable cardinals in ZF, are equiconsistent.

=== Weak inaccessibility of real-valued measurable cardinals ===
Say that a cardinal number &quot;α&quot; is an &quot;Ulam number&quot; if

whenever


then
::if |&quot;X&quot;| ≤ &quot;α&quot; then &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = 0.

Equivalently, a cardinal number &quot;α&quot; is an Ulam number if

whenever
# &quot;ν&quot; is an outer measure on a set &quot;Y,&quot; and &quot;F&quot; a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of &quot;Y,&quot;
# &quot;ν&quot;(⋃&quot;F&quot;) &lt; ∞,
# &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = 0 for &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;F,&quot;
# ⋃&quot;G&quot; is &quot;ν&quot;-measurable for every &quot;G&quot; ⊂ &quot;F,&quot;
then
::if |&quot;F&quot;| ≤ &quot;α&quot; then &quot;ν&quot;(⋃&quot;F&quot;) = 0.

The smallest infinite cardinal ℵ0 is an Ulam number. The class of Ulam numbers is closed under the cardinal successor operation. If an infinite cardinal &quot;β&quot; has an immediate predecessor &quot;α&quot; that is an Ulam number, assume &quot;μ&quot; satisfies properties ()–() with &quot;X&quot; = &quot;β.&quot; In the von Neumann model of ordinals and cardinals, for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot;, choose an injective function

:&quot;f&quot;&quot;x&quot;: &quot;x&quot; → &quot;α&quot;

and define the sets

:&quot;U&quot;(&quot;b, a&quot;) = { &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot; | &quot;f&quot;&quot;x&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; }

Since the &quot;f&quot;&quot;x&quot; are one-to-one, the sets

:{ &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b, a&quot;) | &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot; } with &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;α&quot; fixed
:{ &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b, a&quot;) | &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;α&quot; } with &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot; fixed

are pairwise disjoint. By property () of &quot;μ,&quot; the set

:{ &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;β&quot; | &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;U&quot;(&quot;b, a&quot;)) &gt; 0 }

is countable, and hence

:|{ (&quot;b, a&quot;) ∈ &quot;β&quot; × &quot;α&quot; | &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;U&quot;(&quot;b, a&quot;)) &gt; 0 }| ≤ ℵ0⋅&quot;α.&quot;

Thus there is a &quot;b&quot;0 such that

:&quot;μ&quot;(&quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;)) = 0 for every &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;α&quot;

implying, since &quot;α&quot; is an Ulam number and using the second definition (with &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;μ&quot; and conditions ()–() fulfilled),

:&quot;μ&quot;(⋃&quot;a&quot;∈&quot;α&quot; &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;)) = 0.

If &quot;b&quot;0 &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;β&quot; and &quot;f&quot;x(&quot;b&quot;0) = &quot;a&quot;&quot;x&quot; then &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;&quot;x&quot;). Thus

:&quot;β&quot; = b0 ∪ {b0} ∪ ⋃&quot;a&quot;∈&quot;α&quot; &quot;U&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;a&quot;)

By property (), &quot;μ&quot;({&quot;b&quot;0}) = 0, and since |&quot;b&quot;0| ≤ &quot;α&quot;, by (), () and (), &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;b&quot;0) = 0. It follows that &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) = 0. The conclusion is that &quot;β&quot; is an Ulam number.

There is a similar proof that the supremum of a set &quot;S&quot; of Ulam numbers with |&quot;S&quot;| an Ulam number is again a Ulam number. Together with the previous result, this implies that a cardinal that is not an Ulam number is weakly inaccessible.

<text>Warlords is an out-of-print multi-player fantasy collectible card game published in September 1997 by Iron Crown Enterprises. It is based on material from the video game &quot;Warlords III&quot;, for which Iron Crown licensed the intellectual property from Strategic Studies Group (SSG). It was designed by a team with Ian Trout of SSG. The 351-card set was sold in starter decks of 60 cards and booster packs of 12 cards. Each of the eight different starter decks consisted of a fixed number of cards related to one of the factions, with the remainder of the cards randomly included from the set of non-faciton cards.

==Gameplay==
The objective is to become the first player to become the supreme Warlord. This is achieved by exploring, finding treasure, or waging war by assembling followers, gathering armies, and building citadels. The game was criticized for using a &quot;Combat Resolution Table&quot; where a player would add the Battle Value of their Army, Hero, Ally, and Artefact (sic) in a given stack, add terrain bonuses, subtracts the defender&#x27;s total Battle Value, and then compare it to the table to determine the number of cards lost in each stack. The cards had no rarities and lacked tournament support at the time.

==Reception==
The reviewer from the online second volume of &quot;Pyramid&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Warlords&quot;. One of the best tactical combat games ever created for home computers. [...] Now it&#x27;s a trading card game designed by the same folks as the computer games, and let me tell you its one of the most enjoyable TCGs I&#x27;ve played yet.&quot;

<text>In set theory, a strong cardinal is a type of large cardinal. It is a weakening of the notion of a supercompact cardinal.

== Formal definition ==

If λ is any ordinal, κ is λ-strong means that κ is a cardinal number and there exists an elementary embedding &quot;j&quot; from the universe &quot;V&quot; into a transitive inner model &quot;M&quot; with critical point κ and

:formula_1

That is, &quot;M&quot; agrees with &quot;V&quot; on an initial segment. Then κ is strong means that it is λ-strong for all ordinals λ.

== Relationship with other large cardinals ==

By definitions, strong cardinals lie below supercompact cardinals and above measurable cardinals in the consistency strength hierarchy.

κ is κ-strong if and only if it is measurable. If κ is strong or λ-strong for λ ≥ κ+2, then the ultrafilter &quot;U&quot; witnessing that κ is measurable will be in &quot;V&quot;κ+2 and thus in &quot;M&quot;. So for any α &lt; κ, we have that there exist an ultrafilter &quot;U&quot; in &quot;j&quot;(&quot;V&quot;κ) − &quot;j&quot;(&quot;V&quot;α), remembering that &quot;j&quot;(α) = α. Using the elementary embedding backwards, we get that there is an ultrafilter in &quot;V&quot;κ − &quot;V&quot;α. So there are arbitrarily large measurable cardinals below κ which is regular, and thus κ is a limit of κ-many measurable cardinals.

Strong cardinals also lie below superstrong cardinals and Woodin cardinals in consistency strength. However, the least strong cardinal is larger than the least superstrong cardinal.

Every strong cardinal is strongly unfoldable and therefore totally indescribable.

<text>In set theory, a Woodin cardinal (named for W. Hugh Woodin) is a cardinal number formula_1 such that for all functions formula_2, there exists a cardinal formula_3 with formula_4 and an elementary embedding formula_5 from the Von Neumann universe formula_6 into a transitive inner model formula_7 with critical point formula_8 and formula_9.

An equivalent definition is this: formula_1 is Woodin if and only if formula_1 is strongly inaccessible and for all formula_12 there exists a formula_13 which is formula_14-formula_15-strong.

formula_16 being formula_14-formula_15-strong means that for all ordinals formula_19, there exist a formula_20 which is an elementary embedding with critical point formula_16, formula_22, formula_23 and formula_24. (See also strong cardinal.)

A Woodin cardinal is preceded by a stationary set of measurable cardinals, and thus it is a Mahlo cardinal. However, the first Woodin cardinal is not even weakly compact.

== Explanation ==

The hierarchy formula_25 (known as the von Neumann hierarchy) is defined by transfinite recursion on formula_26:
* formula_27,
* formula_28,
* formula_29, when formula_26 is a limit ordinal.

For any ordinal formula_26, formula_25 is a set. The union of the sets formula_25 for all ordinals formula_26 is no longer a set, but a proper class. Some of the sets formula_25 have set-theoretic properties, for example when formula_8 is an inaccessible cardinal, formula_37 satisfies second-order ZFC (&quot;satisfies&quot; here means the notion of satisfaction from first-order logic).

For a transitive class formula_7, a function formula_39 is said to be an elementary embedding if for any formula formula_40 with free variables formula_41 in the language of set theory, it is the case that formula_42 iff formula_43, where formula_44 is first-order logic&#x27;s notion of satisfaction as before. An elementary embedding formula_45 is called nontrivial if it is not the identity. If formula_39 is a nontrivial elementary embedding, there exists an ordinal formula_8 such that formula_48, and the least such formula_8 is called the critical point of formula_45.

Many large cardinal properties can be phrased in terms of elementary embeddings. For an ordinal formula_51, a cardinal formula_8 is said to be formula_51-strong if a transitive class formula_7 can be found such that there is a nontrivial elementary embedding formula_39 whose critical point is formula_8, and in addition formula_57.

A strengthening of the notion of formula_51-strong cardinal is the notion of formula_15-strongness of a cardinal formula_8 in a greater cardinal formula_61: if formula_8 and formula_61 are cardinals with formula_64, and formula_15 is a subset of formula_66, then formula_8 is said to be formula_15-strong in formula_61 if for all formula_70, there is a nontrivial elementary embedding formula_39 witnessing that formula_8 is formula_51-strong, and in addition formula_74. (This is a strengthening, as when letting formula_75, formula_8 being formula_15-strong in formula_61 implies that formula_8 is formula_51-strong for all formula_70, as given any formula_70, formula_83 must be equal to formula_84, formula_66 must be a subset of formula_86 and therefore a subset of the range of formula_45.) Finally, a cardinal formula_61 is Woodin if for any choice of formula_89, there exists a formula_64 such that formula_8 is formula_15-strong in formula_61.

== Consequences ==

Woodin cardinals are important in descriptive set theory. By a result of Martin and Steel, existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals implies projective determinacy, which in turn implies that every projective set is Lebesgue measurable, has the Baire property (differs from an open set by a meager set, that is, a set which is a countable union of nowhere dense sets), and the perfect set property (is either countable or contains a perfect subset).

The consistency of the existence of Woodin cardinals can be proved using determinacy hypotheses. Working in ZF+AD+DC one can prove that formula_94 is Woodin in the class of hereditarily ordinal-definable sets. formula_94 is the first ordinal onto which the continuum cannot be mapped by an ordinal-definable surjection (see Θ (set theory)).

Mitchell and Steel showed that assuming a Woodin cardinal exists, there is an inner model containing a Woodin cardinal in which there is a formula_96-well-ordering of the reals, ◊ holds, and the generalized continuum hypothesis holds.

Shelah proved that if the existence of a Woodin cardinal is consistent then it is consistent that the nonstationary ideal on formula_97 is formula_98-saturated. 
Woodin also proved the equiconsistency of the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals and the existence of an formula_99-dense ideal over formula_99.

==Hyper-Woodin cardinals==
A cardinal formula_8 is called hyper-Woodin if there exists a normal measure formula_102 on formula_8 such that for every set formula_104, the set

:formula_105 is formula_106-formula_104-strongformula_108

is in formula_102.

formula_1 is formula_111-formula_104-strong if and only if for each formula_113 there is a transitive class formula_114 and an elementary embedding

:formula_115

with

:formula_116
:formula_117, and

:formula_118.

The name alludes to the classical result that a cardinal is Woodin if and only if for every set formula_104, the set

:formula_105 is formula_106-formula_104-strongformula_108

is a stationary set.

The measure formula_102 will contain the set of all Shelah cardinals below formula_8.

==Weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals==
A cardinal formula_8 is called weakly hyper-Woodin if for every set formula_104 there exists a normal measure formula_102 on formula_8 such that the set formula_105 is formula_106-formula_104-strongformula_108 is in formula_102. formula_1 is formula_111-formula_104-strong if and only if for each formula_113 there is a transitive class formula_114 and an elementary
embedding formula_115 with formula_141, formula_142, and formula_143

The name alludes to the classic result that a cardinal is Woodin if for every set formula_104, the set formula_105 is formula_106-formula_104-strongformula_108 is stationary.

The difference between hyper-Woodin cardinals and weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals is that the choice of formula_102 does not depend on the choice of the set formula_104 for hyper-Woodin cardinals.

==Woodin-in-the-next-admissible cardinals==
Let formula_61 be a cardinal and let formula_26 be the least admissible ordinal greater than formula_61. The cardinal formula_61 is said to be Woodin-in-the-next-admissible if for any function formula_155 such that formula_156, there exists formula_64 such that formula_158, and there is an extender formula_159 such that formula_160 and formula_161. These cardinals appear when building models from iteration trees.p.4

<doc id="248110" wikidata="Q384856" url="?curid=248110" title="Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury">
<text>Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury KG PC (1400 – 31 December 1460) was an English nobleman and magnate based in northern England who became a key supporter of the House of York during the early years of the Wars of the Roses. He was the father of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;.

==Origins==

He was born in 1400 at Raby Castle in County Durham, the third son (and tenth child) of Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his second wife, Joan Beaufort, the youngest of the four legitimised children and only daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (third surviving son of King Edward III), by his mistress, later wife, Katherine Swynford.

The Neville lands were primarily in County Durham and Yorkshire, but both King Richard II and King Henry IV (Joan&#x27;s cousin and half-brother respectively) found the family useful to counterbalance the strength of the Percys on the Scottish Borders. This led to Ralph&#x27;s earldom being granted in 1397, and to his appointment as Warden of the West March in 1403. 

Ralph&#x27;s marriage to Joan Beaufort, at a time when the distinction between royalty and nobility was becoming more important, can be seen as another reward; as a granddaughter of King Edward III, she was a member of the royal family.

The children of Ralph&#x27;s first wife, Margaret Stafford, made good marriages to local nobility, and his eldest son had married into royalty in the person of Elizabeth Holland, but his Beaufort children married into even greater families. Three of Richard&#x27;s sisters married dukes, the youngest Cecily, married Richard, Duke of York.

==Marriage==

Richard married Alice Montagu, daughter and heiress of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury. The date of Richard and Alice&#x27;s marriage is not known, but it must have been before February 1421, when as a married couple they appeared at the coronation of Queen Catherine of Valois. At the time of the marriage, the Salisbury inheritance was not guaranteed, as not only was Thomas Montacute still alive, but in 1424 he remarried (to Alice Chaucer, granddaughter of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer). This second marriage was without issue and when Thomas Montagu died in 1428, Richard Neville and Alice were confirmed as the Earl and Countess of Salisbury.

Salisbury came into possession of greater estates than, as a younger son under primogeniture, he could reasonably have expected. Strangely, his eldest half-brother John Neville apparently agreed to many of the rights to the Neville inheritance being transferred to his step-mother Joan Beaufort, and her son Salisbury inherited these on her death in 1440. 

He also gained possession of the lands and grants made jointly to Ralph and Joan. Ralph&#x27;s heir (his grandson Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland) as the representative of the senior line, disputed the loss of his inheritance, and although he agreed to a settlement in 1443, it was on unequal terms – Salisbury kept the great Neville possessions of Middleham and Sheriff Hutton, as well as the more recent grant of Penrith. 

Only Raby Castle, the family&#x27;s most ancient possession, returned to the senior branch. The resultant Neville–Neville feud was later to become absorbed into the destructive Percy-Neville feud. Salisbury&#x27;s marriage gained him his wife&#x27;s quarter share of the Holland inheritance. Ironically, his Salisbury title came with comparatively little in terms of wealth, though he did gain a more southerly residence at Bisham Manor in Berkshire.

==Warden of the West March==

The defence of the Scottish Border was carried out by two Wardens – that of the East March (based at Berwick-upon-Tweed) and that of the West March at Carlisle. Both offices had been held by the Percy family in the fourteenth century, and their support of King Henry IV seemed to have paid off in 1399, when Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland was appointed Warden of the West March and his son Henry Percy (&quot;Hotspur&quot;) as Warden of the East March. However, Hotspur rebelled, and his father was held to be complicit in his treason. 

After Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, Ralph Neville was employed by King Henry V to capture the elder Percy. His reward was to succeed the Percys as Warden of both Marches. Under King Henry V, the Percys were restored to their lands, and eventually in 1417, to the East March.
Salisbury became a Knight Bachelor and was named Warden of the West March in 1420. It was one of the most valuable appointments in England, worth £1,500 in peacetime and four times that if war broke out with Scotland. Although unlike Calais, it did not require a permanent garrison, the incessant raiding and border skirmishes meant that there would always be a ready supply of trained and experienced soldiers at the Warden&#x27;s command. Salisbury must have been high in Henry V&#x27;s estimation, as he was also appointed Justice of the Peace in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham. In 1431, he accompanied the young King Henry VI to France for his coronation, and on his return was made Warden of the East March. 

In 1436, he resigned from both posts, although this may have originally been intended as a means of forcing the crown to make good its arrears of payment. When his resignation was accepted, he accompanied his brother-in-law Richard, Duke of York, to France, taking 1,300 men-at-arms and archers with him. He returned the following year, and in November became a member of the King&#x27;s Council. 

He did not resume either of the Wardenships, as the Percy-Neville dispute took up most of his time, but when this was resolved in 1443 he resumed the Wardenship of the West March. Although this was at a reduced fee of just under £1,000, the money was secured on specific sources of Crown income, not on the frequently uncollectable tallies. 

He was invested as a Knight of the Order of the Garter (K.G.) in 1436. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor (P.C.) the following year, in 1437.

==Neville and Percy==
At the end of 1443, from his principal seat at Middleham Castle in Wensleydale, Salisbury was a member of the King&#x27;s Council and Warden of the West March. His brother Robert Neville was the Bishop of Durham, and another of his brothers, William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent, had the custody of Roxburgh Castle. He had seven children, four boys and three girls. In 1436 the two oldest children, Cicely and Richard, made excellent marriages to the son and daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick.

It was becoming apparent that the rise of the Nevilles was coming to an end. The king, who during the late 1430s had started to exercise personal rule, was more concerned to promote the fortunes of his closest relatives – and Salisbury was only related by a junior, legitimised and female line. In this context, the local rivalry between the Nevilles and the Percys in the north of England was likely to take on greater importance. A strong and capable ruler would be able to control such feuds, or even profit from them. A weak king could find the disputes spreading from local to regional or national conflict.
The Percys had lands throughout northern England, while the northern lands of the Nevilles were concentrated in north Yorkshire and in County Durham. As Warden of the West March, Salisbury was in a position to exert great power in the northwest, in spite of holding only Kendal and Penrith. The Percys resented the fact that their tenants in Cumberland and Westmorland were being recruited by Salisbury, who even with the reduced grant of 1443 still had great spending power in the region. The senior Neville line (now related by marriage to the Percys) still resented the inequitable settlement of their inheritance dispute.

The fifteenth century could be regarded as the peak of &quot;bastard feudalism&quot; – when every subject needed a &quot;good lord&quot;. In return for a commitment by the retained man to provide (usually) military support, the lord would give his retainer a small annual fee, a badge or item of clothing to mark his loyalty (livery) and provide help for him in his disputes with his neighbours (maintenance). Northern England was a long way from the Palace of Westminster, and rapid legal redress for wrongs was impossible. With his economic power as Warden, Salisbury could provide better support for Percy tenants than Northumberland, unpaid in regard to the East March for years, could hope to.

In 1448, during the renewal of the war with Scotland, Northumberland took his forces through Salisbury&#x27;s West March – a grave breach of etiquette. Northumberland was defeated at the Battle of Sark, and his son Henry Percy, Lord Poynings was captured. The fact that Salisbury lost 2,000 horses trying to respond to this attack, and was then excluded (along with Northumberland) from the subsequent peace negotiations, can only have inflamed relations between the two families. Over time, the ill will might have receded, but Northumberland&#x27;s second son, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, spent the next few years stirring up trouble in Yorkshire – particularly at York, situated between the Percy estates of Spofforth and Healaugh, and Neville&#x27;s castle at Sheriff Hutton.

On 24 August 1453, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, assembled a force of men-at-arms and archers perhaps as large as 1,000 strong, intending to waylay Salisbury and his family at Heworth Moor, outside York, as he made for Sheriff Hutton. Salisbury had been attending the wedding of his son Thomas in Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, and although his escort would have been smaller, it would have been better armed than Egremont&#x27;s York craftsmen and tradesmen. Salisbury and his retinue fought them back, arriving unscathed at Sheriff Hutton, but the episode marked the beginning of what was virtually a private war. The bride, Maud Stanhope, was the widow of Lord Willoughby of Eresby, his son would become a Yorkist. Another of the Yorkist party, John Neville, was later Lord Montagu. Maud was due to inherit the manors of Wressle and Burwell from her uncle, Lord Cromwell, who had obtained them from the Percys through litigation. Historian John Sadler argues this was the first incident in the Yorkist/Lancastrian affinities lawless squabble leading to civil war.

==Neville and York==
Salisbury changed his allegiance to Richard, Duke of York, who made him Lord Chancellor in 1455. This enabled Salisbury to advance the interests of his retainers against the Percies; for example Thomas de la More petitioned against Lord Egremont, whom de la More claimed had threatened to kill him years earlier. When King Henry VI tried to assert his independence and dismiss York as Protector, Salisbury joined him in fighting at the First Battle of St Albans, claiming that he was acting in self-defence. In 1458 he participated in The Love Day, an attempt at reconciliation held in London. He was notably successful in the Battle of Blore Heath, but after the Yorkist army collapsed in the Rout of Ludford Bridge, Salisbury escaped to Calais, having been specifically excluded from a royal pardon. He returned to England with York in 1460, and was slain on 30–31 December 1460, the night after the Battle of Wakefield.

==Death and burial==
After the defeat of the Yorkists at the Battle of Wakefield, Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night. Upon discovery, battle-worn and now a traitor to the realm, he was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself due to his great wealth, he was nevertheless dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by the local population, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.

He was buried first at Pontefract, but his sons transferred his body to the family mausoleum at Bisham Priory in Berkshire where they erected a monument to his memory. The effigy from this was brought to St Mary&#x27;s Church at Burghfield, near Reading, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The effigy of a lady alongside him wears a headdress which is not thought to be of the right date to be his wife, but she may represent one of the earlier Countesses of Salisbury buried at Bisham.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Alice Montacute (1407–1462), daughter and heiress of Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury (1388–1428), by whom he had twelve children:

<text>John Alva Keel, born Alva John Kiehle (March 25, 1930 – July 3, 2009), was an American journalist and influential ufologist who is known best as author of &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot;.

==Early life==
Keel was born in Hornell, New York, the son of a singer and bandleader. His parents soon divorced and Keel was raised by his grandparents in Perry, New York until his mother remarried.

He was fascinated by magic from an early age and was known as &quot;Houdini&quot; by his friends. He loved reading about magic, humor, science, travel, and aviation. His first story was published in a magicians&#x27; magazine when he was twelve years old. At age fourteen he was determined to become a writer. He had a column in the Perry Herald named &quot;Scraping The Keel&quot;, he published a science fiction fanzine named &quot;The Lunarite&quot; and he routinely sent stories to magazines in New York. At the age of sixteen he had taken all of the science courses at his school and decided to quit school and write full time.

==Career==

===Early career as a writer and journalist===
At seventeen he relocated to New York City to make a living as a writer. He lived in Greenwich Village and became the editor of a poetry magazine. He worked as a freelance contributor to newspapers, scriptwriter for local radio and television outlets, and author of pulp articles such as &quot;Are You A Repressed Sex Fiend?&quot; 

===Work for the US Army===
He was drafted into the US Army during the Korean War. Because he had worked with radio and television he was assigned to the radio station American Forces Network at Frankfurt, Germany and started writing radio programs. Within one year he was the chief of productions for the network. When his two years of military service ended he was offered and accepted a civilian job for the Army.

He claimed that while in the Army he was trained in psychological warfare as a propaganda writer.

===Writer and journalist===
After his time with the military he was a foreign radio correspondent in Paris, Berlin, Rome and Egypt.

At age 24 he resigned and traveled for four years around the Middle East and south-east Asia. He tried to find performers of the Indian rope trick, investigate fakirs and yogis and he even tried to track the Yeti. That journey became his first published book, &quot;Jadoo&quot; (1957)

During the 1960s, he worked for television. He was the chief writer for game show Play Your Hunch and wrote for tv series such as &quot;Mack &amp; Myer for Hire&quot;, &quot;the Chuck McCann Show&quot;, &quot;the Clay Cole Show&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot; and &quot;Lost in Space&quot;.

He wrote some novels using the pseudonym, Harry Gibbs. In 1966 he wrote a fiction novel named &quot;The Fickle Finger of Fate&quot;. It sold an estimated 600,000 copies.

In 1966 Playboy asked him to write an article about UFOs for the magazine, but his work was rejected and never printed. Keel had however become interested in the subject. He claims to have traveled to 20 states and interviewed thousands of witnesses, several hundreds of them in depth. The material was used in his book &quot;Operation Trojan Horse&quot;. He also made repeated visits to Point Pleasant, West Virginia, and investigated sightings that was the topic of his best known book, &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; (1975). 

His interviews and thoughts concerning UFOs were published in magazines such as Flying Saucer Review, Flying Saucer, Saga and Saucer News. 

He was a technical advisor to the Library of Congress (1968-69), and special consultant to the office of Scientific Research and Bureau of Radiology (1968-71), before becoming a consultant to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

He was a member of the Screenwriters Guild.

==Paranormal research==
Keel is considered &quot;one of ufology&#x27;s most widely-read and influential authors&quot;. As a researcher he was both original and controversial.

Richard Hatem, the screenwriter for The Mothman Prophecies, has described Keel as the Hunter S. Thompson of paranormal writers.

===Men in black===
Keel invented the term &quot;men in black&quot; in an article for the men&#x27;s adventure magazine &quot;Saga&quot; published 1967.

===Rejection of Extraterrestrial hypothesis===
Like contemporary 1960s researchers such as J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallée, Keel was initially hopeful that he could somehow validate the prevailing extraterrestrial visitation hypothesis. However, after a year of investigations, Keel concluded that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was untenable. Indeed, both Hynek and Vallée eventually had a similar conclusion. As Keel himself wrote: 

:I abandoned the extraterrestrial hypothesis in 1967 when my own field investigations disclosed an astonishing overlap between psychic phenomena and UFOs... The objects and apparitions do not necessarily originate on another planet and may not even exist as permanent constructions of matter. It is more likely that we see what we want to see and interpret such visions according to our contemporary beliefs.

In his books &quot;UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse&quot; and &quot;The Eighth Tower&quot; Keel argues that a non-human or spiritual intelligence source has staged whole events during a long period of time in order to propagate and reinforce certain erroneous belief systems. For example, monsters, ghosts and demons, the fairy faith of Middle Europe, vampire legends, mystery airships in 1897, mystery aeroplanes of the 1930s, mystery helicopters, anomalous creature sightings, poltergeist phenomena, spheres of light, and unidentified flying objects; Keel conjectured that ultimately all of these anomalies are a cover for the real phenomenon. He used the term &quot;ultraterrestrials&quot; to describe UFO occupants he believed to be non-human entities capable of assuming whatever form they desire.

In &quot;Our Haunted Planet,&quot; Keel discussed the seldom-considered possibility that the alien &quot;visitors&quot; to Earth are not visitors at all, but an advanced Earth civilization, which may or may not be human. Interdimensional life is also considered.

Keel did not state any hypothesis about the ultimate purpose of the phenomenon other than that the UFO intelligence seems to have a long-standing interest with interacting with the human race.

===The Mothman Prophecies===
&quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; (1975) is Keel&#x27;s account of investigating an alleged sighting in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia of a huge, winged creature termed Mothman. The name, Mothman, was invented by a newspaper subeditor. 

The book was widely popularized as the basis of a 2002 movie of the same name featuring Richard Gere, Will Patton, Laura Linney and Alan Bates. Gere and Bates played two parts of Keel&#x27;s personality. Bates&#x27;s character is named &quot;Leek,&quot; which is &quot;Keel&quot; spelled backwards. Gere&#x27;s newspaper journalist character is named &quot;John Klein,&quot; also a play on Keel&#x27;s name.

Keel was pleased with director Mark Pellingtons interpretation of the book:

:They got a lot of the stuff in the book into the movie, but with slight variations. /.../ I have no real complaints about it. It&#x27;s Hollywood, and it&#x27;s done well - that&#x27;s my feeling about it.

====Criticism====
In the May/June 2002 issue of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, journalist John C. Sherwood, a former business associate of UFO researcher Gray Barker, published an analysis of private letters between Keel and Barker during the period of Keel&#x27;s investigation. In the article, &quot;Gray Barker&#x27;s Book of Bunk,&quot; Sherwood reported finding significant differences between what Keel wrote at the time of his investigation and what he wrote in his first book about the Mothman reports, raising questions about the book&#x27;s accuracy. Sherwood also reported that Keel, who was well known for writing humorous and outrageous letters to friends and associates, would not assist him in clarifying the differences.

==Paranormal experiences==
Keel&#x27;s friend Marc Coppola claimed that Keel &quot;could look at people and tell exactly when they were going to die&quot;.

==Trivia==
He once had a business card that read: John A. Keel, Not an Authority on Anything.

In re-prints of his book Jadoo he is described as &quot;a real-life Indiana Jones&quot; by his publisher Barnes and Noble.

==Personal life==
Keel did not cook. His Upper West Side local eatery was named Edgar&#x27;s.

One of his closest friends was fellow paranormal researcher Ivan T. Sanderson.

Keel&#x27;s apartment was &quot;littered with literally tens of thousands of books in stacks, and papers piled unreachably high&quot;.

For many years, Keel resided in the Upper West Side of New York City. He was a lifelong bachelor.

Keel died on July 3, 2009, in New York City, at the age of 79.

<doc id="248112" wikidata="Q408171" url="?curid=248112" title="Kavalactone">
<text>Kavalactones are a class of lactone compounds found in kava roots and &quot;Alpinia zerumbet&quot; (shell ginger). and in several Gymnopilus, Phellinus and Inonotus fungi. Some kavalactones are bioactive. They are responsible for the psychoactive, analgesic, euphoric and sedative effects of kava. 

==Bioactivity==
Kava extract interacts with many pharmaceuticals and herbal medications. In human volunteers, in vivo inhibition includes CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 through use of probe drugs to measure inhibition.

== Research ==
Its anxiolytic and hepatotoxicity activities have been investigated.

The major kavalactones (except for desmethoxyyangonin) potentiate GABAA receptors, which may underlie the anxiolytic and sedative properties of kava. Further, inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, binding to the CB1 receptor, inhibition of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, and monoamine oxidase B reversible inhibition are additional pharmacological actions that have been reported for kavalactones.

Kavalactone-type compounds may help protect against high glucose induced cell damage.

==Toxicity==
Several kavalactones (e.g., methysticin and yangonin) affect a group of enzymes involved in metabolism, called the CYP450 system. Hepatotoxicity occurred in a small portion of previously healthy kava users, particularly from extracts, as opposed to whole root powders.

== Compounds ==

At least 18 different kavalactones are known, with methysticin being the first identified.
Multiple analogues, such as ethysticin, have also been isolated.
Some consist of a substituted α-pyrone as the lactone, while others are partially saturated.

The average elimination half-life of kavalactones typically present in kava root is 9 hr.

==Biosynthesis==
The kavalactone biosynthetic pathway in &quot;Piper methysticum&quot; was described in 2019.

<doc id="248113" wikidata="Q5149809" url="?curid=248113" title="Columbia Record">
<text>The Columbia Record was an afternoon daily newspaper published in Columbia, South Carolina. It was established in 1897. International Paper &amp; Power Co. purchased &quot;The Record&quot; in 1929 from R. Charlton Wright, who had been principal owner since 1918. The State had declined a chance to buy the paper in 1928 and subsequently faced stiff competition from its local rival. In 1945 &quot;The State&quot; finally purchased &quot;The Record&quot; from International Paper Co. &quot;The State&quot; for $550,000, to form the State-Record Company. The company was purchased by Knight-Ridder in 1986, and publication of the &quot;Columbia Record&quot; ceased on April 1, 1988. One of the quirks of the paper was that it printed the weekly entertainment section on green newsprint.

The decision to close &quot;The Record&quot; was the natural outgrowth of the decline of afternoon papers nationally. By 1987, the paper&#x27;s circulation was only 27,000 of which only 15,000 were exclusive &quot;Record&quot; subscribers. The rest also subscribed to &quot;The State&quot;. The decision to close the paper was announced by publisher Ben Morris on Jan. 20, 1988. All 50 &quot;Record&quot; employees were transferred to &quot;The State&quot;.

Among the reporters to work at &quot;The Record&quot; was Marilyn Walser Thompson, who was on staff from 1974 to 1982. She gained national recognition for reporting on South Carolina&#x27;s nuclear industry. She later worked for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Reuters, as Washington bureau chief. At &quot;The Post&quot;, she helped manage investigative teams that won Pulitzer Prizes in 1999 and 2000. She also broke the story of Strom Thurmond&#x27;s biracial child.

In the 1987 official style guide and employee instruction manual, the paper was described as a &quot;modest alternative/news editorial voice&quot; to the newspaper of record, The State. The focus was on &quot;the people, public business and private commerce&quot; of Richland and Lexington counties. Company policy was to &quot;spoonfeed&quot; readers relevant information &quot;as defined by editors to help them be informed and productive citizens.&quot; Both The State and The Record had strict rules against obscenities, which extended even to &quot;mild expletives&quot; such as damn or hell. Only the three top editors could approve publishing &quot;ass&quot; or the other words. &quot;The editors and publisher of The State and The Columbia Record do not consider it a badge of journalist integrity to keep pace with the movies or other segments of society in the area of bar talk,&quot; Executive News Editor Thomas N. McLean wrote.

<text>Speak of the Devil is a live album by English heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne, released in November 1982. It is a double album consisting entirely of live renditions of songs originally recorded by Osbourne&#x27;s previous band Black Sabbath. The album was entitled Talk of the Devil in the UK, that being the more commonly expressed idiom there.

In the UK, it was the second of four Osbourne albums to attain Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in January 1983.

==Background==
===Planned album with Rhoads===
In early February 1982, a decision was made by Osbourne&#x27;s management and record label to record a live album consisting entirely of songs he had recorded in the 1970s with Black Sabbath. Several factors led to this decision. Sabbath&#x27;s publishing deal with their previous management had recently expired; by re-recording these songs all the songwriters (including Osbourne) would benefit from the publishing royalties. Additionally, Jet Records had cut a distribution deal with CBS Records which saw the small label stand to make a sizeable profit from the release. Business decisions aside, Black Sabbath was also readying its own live album release and Osbourne wanted his album in stores first. &quot;We were both going through our own miseries,&quot; recalled Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t afford not to release &quot;Live Evil&quot; and Ozzy was forced into making &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;.&quot;

The plan to record an album of Black Sabbath covers was not met with enthusiasm by Osbourne&#x27;s band. Guitarist Randy Rhoads and drummer Tommy Aldridge refused to participate, feeling that they had established themselves as recording artists and such an album would be a step backwards professionally. They shared their feelings with bassist Rudy Sarzo; although Sarzo was not completely comfortable refusing to participate, he chose to stand with his bandmates and the trio informed manager Sharon Arden of their decision.

Although Sharon took the news reasonably well, Ozzy was furious. He responded by going on what Sarzo described as &quot;the worst drinking binges I had ever witnessed&quot; and his relationship with Rhoads never fully recovered. It was during this tumultuous period that Osbourne was infamously arrested for drunkenly urinating on the Alamo. Several hours before the Alamo incident, he drunkenly fired the entire band (including Rhoads), although he later had no memory of doing so. Osbourne frequently confronted Rhoads on the tour bus and taunted him with claims that the likes of Frank Zappa and Gary Moore were willing to replace him for the live album. Osbourne&#x27;s unstable and confrontational behavior soon convinced Rhoads to leave the band. He grudgingly agreed to perform on the live album but would depart after fulfilling his contractual obligations to Jet Records, which consisted of one more studio album and subsequent tour.

The original plan was to record the album at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens. The show, complete with half-naked girls on the stage in what manager Sharon anticipated would be &quot;the greatest rock spectacle ever,&quot; would also be videotaped and released for the burgeoning home video market. These plans all crumbled upon Rhoads&#x27; sudden death weeks later in a plane crash.

===Arrival of Brad Gillis===
After the death of Rhoads, the band carried on for a short time with guitarist Bernie Tormé, until both parties agreed that the arrangement was not working out. Guitarist Vito Bratta, who was playing in a New York area Black Sabbath cover band at the time, was considered as his replacement but he clashed with Sharon and later lamented that he had blown his big break. Guitarist Brad Gillis arrived in New York City from California on April 5, 1982, to audition for Osbourne&#x27;s band. Sharon dispatched Sarzo to Gillis&#x27; hotel room to teach him the songs. Though Gillis was vaguely familiar with Osbourne&#x27;s music after seeing the band perform live the previous summer at the Day on the Green in Oakland, he was completely unfamiliar with Black Sabbath&#x27;s music. He borrowed a friend&#x27;s old Black Sabbath albums to become more familiar with the songs before leaving for New York City. His ability to faithfully reproduce Rhoads&#x27; parts earned Gillis the job, and he subsequently traveled with the band and became familiar with the material as Bernie Torme played his last few shows before leaving. On April 12, 1982, Gillis performed with the band during soundcheck before a show in Binghamton, New York, and played his first show with the band later that evening. Torme was described as &quot;the consummate professional&quot; during this period, staying with the band until Gillis was ready to step in, even waiting backstage during Gillis&#x27; first few shows in case he was needed.

===Rehearsals===
On September 19, 1982, the band and crew arrived in New York City to begin rehearsals for the two shows that would be recorded to comprise the &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; album. Over the following few days, Gillis, Sarzo, and Aldridge would rehearse in what Sarzo described as a &quot;gloomy midtown Manhattan studio&quot; while Osbourne himself was nowhere to be found. The band was given only five days to learn the songs, though in Aldridge&#x27;s case, he was quite familiar with Black Sabbath&#x27;s material after opening for the band countless times as a member of Black Oak Arkansas in the 1970s. As the band began rehearsing, Sharon arrived and informed them, &quot;Now boys, don’t expect to see much of Ozzy at rehearsals. He’s not being very cooperative.&quot;

The record company planned to include previously recorded live versions of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot;, and &quot;Paranoid&quot; featuring Rhoads on guitar, so Sharon told the band to not bother rehearsing those particular songs. As rehearsals continued without Ozzy, the band was still coming to terms with the loss of Rhoads, and morale was very low. The band members resented the fact that they were rehearsing for an Ozzy Osbourne album while Osbourne himself could not be bothered even showing up. It was during this period that Sarzo, who was already recording the &quot;Metal Health&quot; sessions in secret with Quiet Riot, made his final decision to leave Osbourne&#x27;s band.

==Recording==
Osbourne, who had not rehearsed the songs with his band at all, finally showed up for soundcheck the day of the first show on September 26, 1982, and had tremendous difficulty remembering the lyrics to many of the songs. During the shows, he placed a folding chair with a desk lamp on top of it at center stage, and placed a notebook with handwritten lyrics to the songs on the chair. Throughout the shows, he often stood by this chair, singing as he read the lyrics from the notebook.

The Ritz, which held just under 1,000 people, was sold-out for the performances. Sarzo described the audiences as &quot;rowdy&quot;, and also described the acoustics of the converted Latin ballroom as warm, intimate, and perfect for their needs. The band typically used side-fill monitors to allow the musicians to hear the drums while playing on larger stages, but the Ritz&#x27;s smaller stage forced them to be removed for these shows. This change forced Gillis and Sarzo to spend the majority of the shows standing directly in front of the drum riser in order to hear Aldridge&#x27;s drums over the intense volume of the band&#x27;s backline. 
The mood during the shows was casual, as the usual spectacle of Osbourne&#x27;s live performances was scaled back with the emphasis instead placed on capturing the tightest possible performances for the recordings. The Record Plant&#x27;s mobile studio was parked in an alley behind the Ritz to capture the performances on tape. The band members dressed down, not wearing their usual stage clothes, with Osbourne himself sporting sweatpants and a bald head after drunkenly shaving off his familiar long hair a few days prior. 
Near the ends of the shows, as &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; came up in the setlist, the band let loose and made less effort to play tight, as they had been told by management that these performances would not be included on &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;; previously recorded live versions of those songs featuring Rhoads on guitar were to be used instead. A decision was later made to save the Rhoads versions for a future release, and thus the versions of those songs which ultimately appeared on &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; were taken from one of the performances at The Ritz. Sarzo recalled listening to the final mixes of those songs and being appalled at how sloppy his playing was on those three tracks, as they had only run through them a couple of times in rehearsal.

As the band, minus Osbourne, flew back to Los Angeles on September 28 after completing the shows, Gillis played them the demo recordings he had made with Night Ranger that would comprise the band&#x27;s soon-to-be released debut album, while Sarzo played them the new Quiet Riot recordings he had been working on in secret. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Sarzo promptly quit Osbourne&#x27;s band and officially rejoined Quiet Riot, prompting a long and bitter feud with Osbourne that would culminate in the vocalist assaulting him backstage at the US Festival in 1983. Gillis also left Osbourne&#x27;s band shortly thereafter, returning to Night Ranger weeks later. &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; represents the only official Osbourne recording to feature the guitarist&#x27;s work.

Album producer Max Norman stated in 2007 that due to a limited budget, he had Osbourne and the band perform an entire extra show with no audience in the afternoon of either the 26th or 27 September. Norman recorded that performance in the event that the actual live shows were not of suitable quality for release. &quot;At least we&#x27;ve got a choice and we&#x27;ll have more material to draw from&quot;, he said of this decision. According to Norman, the finished album features three songs from that performance with crowd noise later added in post-production. Though Norman did not specifically identify which tracks he was referring to, he said &quot;If you got nothing to do for a couple of days you could just lie there and listen to them in the headphones and figure out which songs had the real audience and which ones didn&#x27;t.&quot; Soundboard recordings of both night&#x27;s performances exist and both have appeared on bootleg releases. However all of the tracks appearing on &quot;Speak of the Devil,&quot; with the exception of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, were recorded at the 27 September show. &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; was not played at either of the Ritz concerts and the recorded version included on &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; is believed to have come from the afternoon recording referenced by Norman.

==Other==
A double album, &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; represents the fulfillment of a contractual obligation, as Osbourne owed Jet Records two more records. Though the album has long been a fan favorite, Osbourne himself has publicly renounced &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;, stating that it was only released to satisfy a contractual obligation. The live versions of &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; and &quot;Paranoid&quot; featuring Randy Rhoads which were originally intended to be part of &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; were eventually released in 1987 on &quot;Tribute&quot;, an album dedicated to the memory of the deceased guitarist.

Though they had been full-time members of Osbourne&#x27;s band for some time, this is Osbourne&#x27;s first album to feature bassist Sarzo and drummer Aldridge. The duo had been credited on the 1981 &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; album but did not actually perform on it. &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot;&#x27;s gatefold includes multiple photos of a member of Osbourne&#x27;s road crew (who took part in the stage show by bringing the vocalist drinks between songs) who suffered from dwarfism and who Osbourne nicknamed &quot;Ronnie&quot;, a joke aimed at Ronnie James Dio. Dio had replaced Osbourne as Black Sabbath&#x27;s lead vocalist and stood only 5&#x27; 4&quot; tall.

&quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; was released one month before Osbourne&#x27;s former band, Black Sabbath, released their own live album entitled &quot;Live Evil&quot;, a situation which contributed to a growing rivalry between the two camps. In the US, sales of &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; were much better than those of &quot;Live Evil&quot;, while in the UK it was &quot;Live Evil&quot; which attained the higher chart-placing: figures on ultimate sales are not widely available.

The original CD release of &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; omitted the song &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;, presumably due to time constraints. It was, however, reinstated for the 1995 reissue of the album.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward.


==Video==
A Japan-only official release video also entitled &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; has been available since the early 1980s. This video release has no relation to the album of the same name, consisting of Osbourne&#x27;s early solo material rounded out by three Black Sabbath numbers. This video release features an outdoor live performance recorded on 23 June 1982, at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre with the same backing band as the album of the same name. The recording was done by MTV and originally broadcast on the cable network on 31 October 1982, under the title &quot;MTV Halloween Live from Irvine&quot;.

Being an outdoor show, wind resulted in insufficient haze from the fog machines to reflect the laser light show, and thus they weren&#x27;t used; the lasers seen in the final edit were added later in post-production. On 16 July 1982, the band members gathered at Jet Records&#x27; offices in Los Angeles to watch the final edit. Osbourne was unhappy with the laser show and stormed out of the room. Bassist Rudy Sarzo later observed him in the parking lot, drunkenly letting the air out of the producer&#x27;s tires in protest.

This video was finally released in the US in DVD format on 17 July 2012 from Eagle Rock Entertainment. Following its US release, this DVD has been met with positive responses. William Clark of Guitar International said, &quot;Everything from the stage sets, to the action on stage and the powerful Ozzy persona make this live performance, in a word, fantastic&quot;.

<doc id="248116" wikidata="Q7643154" url="?curid=248116" title="Supercompact cardinal">
<text>In set theory, a supercompact cardinal is a type of large cardinal independently introduced by Solovay and Reinhardt. They display a variety of reflection properties.

==Formal definition==

If formula_1 is any ordinal, formula_2 is formula_1-supercompact means that there exists an elementary embedding formula_4 from the universe formula_5 into a transitive inner model formula_6 with critical point formula_2, formula_8 and

:formula_9

That is, formula_6 contains all of its formula_1-sequences. Then formula_2 is supercompact means that it is formula_1-supercompact for all ordinals formula_1.

Alternatively, an uncountable cardinal formula_2 is supercompact if for every formula_16 such that formula_17 there exists a normal measure over formula_18, in the following sense.

formula_18 is defined as follows:

:formula_20.

An ultrafilter formula_21 over formula_18 is &quot;fine&quot; if it is formula_2-complete and formula_24, for every formula_25. A normal measure over formula_18 is a fine ultrafilter formula_21 over formula_18 with the additional property that every function formula_29 such that formula_30 is constant on a set in formula_21. Here &quot;constant on a set in formula_21&quot; means that there is formula_25 such that formula_34.

==Properties==
Supercompact cardinals have reflection properties. If a cardinal with some property (say a 3-huge cardinal) that is witnessed by a structure of limited rank exists above a supercompact cardinal formula_2, then a cardinal with that property exists below formula_2. For example, if formula_2 is supercompact and the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) holds below formula_2 then it holds everywhere because a bijection between the powerset of formula_39 and a cardinal at least formula_40 would be a witness of limited rank for the failure of GCH at formula_39 so it would also have to exist below formula_39.

Finding a canonical inner model for supercompact cardinals is one of the major problems of inner model theory.

The least supercompact cardinal is the least formula_2 such that for every structure formula_44 with cardinality of the domain formula_45, and for every formula_46 sentence formula_47 such that formula_48, there exists a substructure formula_49 with smaller domain (i.e. formula_50) that satisfies formula_47.

Supercompactness has a combinatorial characterization similar to the property of being ineffable. Let formula_52 be the set of all nonempty subsets of formula_16 which have cardinality formula_54. A cardinal formula_2 is supercompact iff for every set formula_16 (equivalently every cardinal formula_57), for every function formula_58, if formula_59 for all formula_60, then there is some formula_61 such that formula_62 is stationary.

Magidor obtained a variant of the tree property which holds for an inaccessible cardinal iff it is supercompact.

<text>In mathematics, a cardinal number formula_1 is called huge if there exists an elementary embedding formula_2 from formula_3 into a transitive inner model formula_4 with critical point formula_1 and

:formula_6

Here, formula_7 is the class of all sequences of length formula_8 whose elements are in formula_4.

Huge cardinals were introduced by .

== Variants ==
In what follows, formula_10 refers to the formula_11-th iterate of the elementary embedding formula_12, that is, formula_12 composed with itself formula_11 times, for a finite ordinal formula_11. Also, formula_16 is the class of all sequences of length less than formula_8 whose elements are in formula_4. Notice that for the &quot;super&quot; versions, formula_19 should be less than formula_20, not formula_21.

κ is almost n-huge if and only if there is formula_2 with critical point formula_1 and

:formula_24

κ is super almost n-huge if and only if for every ordinal γ there is formula_2 with critical point formula_1, formula_27, and

:formula_24

κ is n-huge if and only if there is formula_2 with critical point formula_1 and

:formula_31

κ is super n-huge if and only if for every ordinal formula_19 there is formula_2 with critical point formula_1, formula_27, and

:formula_31

Notice that 0-huge is the same as measurable cardinal; and 1-huge is the same as huge. A cardinal satisfying one of the rank into rank axioms is formula_11-huge for all finite formula_11.

The existence of an almost huge cardinal implies that Vopěnka&#x27;s principle is consistent; more precisely any almost huge cardinal is also a Vopěnka cardinal.

Kanamori, Reinhardt, and Solovay defined seven large cardinal properties between extendibility and hugeness in strength, named formula_39 through formula_40, and a property formula_41. The additional property formula_42 is equivalent to &quot;formula_1 is huge&quot;, and formula_44 is equivalent to &quot;formula_1 is formula_46-supercompact for all formula_47&quot;. Corazza introduced the property formula_48, lying strictly between formula_49 and formula_50.

== Consistency strength ==
The cardinals are arranged in order of increasing consistency strength as follows:
*almost formula_11-huge
*super almost formula_11-huge
*formula_11-huge
*super formula_11-huge
*almost formula_55-huge
The consistency of a huge cardinal implies the consistency of a supercompact cardinal, nevertheless, the least huge cardinal is smaller than the least supercompact cardinal (assuming both exist).

==ω-huge cardinals==
One can try defining an formula_56-huge cardinal formula_1 as one such that an elementary embedding formula_2 from formula_3 into a transitive inner model formula_4 with critical point formula_1 and formula_62, where formula_46 is the supremum of formula_64 for positive integers formula_11. However Kunen&#x27;s inconsistency theorem shows that such cardinals are inconsistent in ZFC, though it is still open whether they are consistent in ZF. Instead an formula_56-huge cardinal formula_1 is defined as the critical point of an elementary embedding from some rank formula_68 to itself. This is closely related to the rank-into-rank axiom I1.

<text>Gerald David &quot;Lorenzo&quot; Music (May 2, 1937 – August 4, 2001) was an American actor, composer, musician, performer, writer and producer. Music began his career in the 1960s with his wife, Henrietta, forming the comedy duo Gerald and His Hen. He then became a writer and a regular performer on the controversial CBS variety show &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;. In the 1970s, Music co-created the sitcom &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; with David Davis and composed its theme music with his wife. He also wrote episodes for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and &quot;Rhoda&quot;, and got a major voiceover role for playing the unseen, but often heard, Carlton the Doorman in &quot;Rhoda&quot;. Music gained fame in the 1980s for voicing Jim Davis&#x27; comic strip character Garfield in twelve animated specials, and later an animated series, video games, and commercials. His distinctive voice of Garfield was also emulated by other actors following his death in 2001.

==Early life and career==
Gerald David Music was born on May 2, 1937, in Brooklyn, New York City. He was six years old when his family moved to Duluth, Minnesota because of his father&#x27;s job at one of the shipyards. He was a student at Central High School and then at the University of Minnesota Duluth. Music met his wife, Henrietta, in college at its Theatre Arts Department. Together, they had four children and formed a comedy duo, Gerald and His Hen, performing together for eight years, even performing at a USO show in Japan.

==Career==
===Writer===
Music became a writer and a regular performer on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; from 1967 to 1969 and won an Emmy Award for writing. He was a writer and story editor on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&quot; and he co-created &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot; with his writing partner, David Davis. The show ran on CBS from 1972 to 1978; he also co-wrote the theme song to the show with his wife.

Music continued writing for &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; spin-off &quot;Rhoda,&quot; which he co-developed with Davis. While casting &quot;Rhoda&quot;, the producers were looking for a voice actor to play the part of Carlton, the comically unseen doorman. Music had no interest in being an actor, but the producers loved his sleepy, husky voice and offered him that role, which made his voice recognizable to a worldwide television audience. The character was popular enough to warrant a one-off single in 1975 called &quot;Who Is It?&quot; (b/w &quot;The Girl in 510&quot;, United Artists UA-XW643-X), which became a regional hit. Music also co-produced and co-wrote a 1980 animated special titled &quot;Carlton Your Doorman&quot;, which won an Emmy Award. Though it was a pilot episode, CBS did not pick it up as a series.

In 1976, Lorenzo and Henrietta were given the opportunity to host a syndicated television variety show of their own. &quot;The Lorenzo and Henrietta Music Show&quot; was produced at a time when there was a glut of television variety shows, but it did not last. In 1983, Music voiced Ralph the All-Purpose Animal in the stop-motion animated film &quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;.

===&quot;Garfield&quot;===

In the 1980s, Jim Davis&#x27; &quot;Garfield&quot; was the most popular comic strip in America since Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Compilation books and merchandising of the strip were topping best-seller lists, and Davis was negotiating to make an animated television special. Producers needed someone to voice the main character in the strip: Garfield, a fat, lazy, sarcastic, and demanding cat. The audition attracted several famed vocal talents, including Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh. After one audition, Music was immediately cast as the voice of Garfield; in Davis&#x27; words: &quot;I looked at the room full of [voice] actors, and then in the corner I saw Lorenzo, quietly licking himself&quot;. Music would serve as the voice of Garfield in all twelve specials, an animated series, video games, and commercials until his death in 2001.

===Other work===
Music also voiced characters for the animated series &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, &quot;Fluppy Dogs&quot;, &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Pound Puppies&quot;, &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, and &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;. After &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; ended in 1994, Music retired from cartoon voice acting.

Music did voice-overs for many commercials for prime-time TV, such as Larry the Crash Test Dummy in the &quot;You Could Learn a Lot from a Dummy&quot; public safety announcements sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and for Florida grapefruit juice, a lesser-known series of commercials extolling Florida agriculture as opposed to the more popular &quot;Florida orange juice&quot; commercials.

In keeping with his beliefs in Subud and its emphasis on charity, Music frequently volunteered his time on a suicide hotline. Music recalled that sometimes a caller would change his tone: &quot;I am bankrupt, my wife ran off with another man... Hey, you sound just like that cat on TV!&quot;

Music&#x27;s voice could be heard on &quot;Stan Freberg Presents the United States of America Volume Two&quot; album, released as a CD by Rhino Records. Music appeared on the album as James Madison and Robert E. Lee. He also appeared as an intercom announcer on an episode of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;. Music served as the voice-over for commercials for Ore-Ida Potatoes and Fruit and Cream Strawberry Twinkies. He later served as the pitchman for Ruggles Ice Cream.

==Personal life==
Music was married to composer/writer Henrietta Music for forty-two years; together they had four children.

==Death and legacy==
Music died from complications related to lung and bone cancer on August 4, 2001, at the age of 64. His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

Since Music&#x27;s death, Frank Welker replaced him as the voice of Garfield in three fully-CGI films, an animated series, and the Nickelodeon crossover fighting video game &quot;All-Star Brawl&quot;. Garfield&#x27;s voice was also provided by Bill Murray in two live-action films. Coincidentally, Music voiced Peter Venkman in the first two seasons of &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; before being replaced by Dave Coulier. Welker provided the voices of Ray Stantz and Slimer in the same series as well. Chris Pratt voiced Garfield in a CGI animated film in 2024.

==Early life and education==

Jones was born on September 15, 1946, in San Saba, Texas. His mother, Lucille Marie Jones (; 1928–2013), was a police officer, school teacher, and beauty shop owner, and his father, Clyde C. Jones (1926–1986), was a cowboy and oil field worker. The two were married and divorced twice. Jones is of Cherokee descent. He was raised in Midland, Texas, and attended Robert E. Lee High School. Jones later moved to Dallas and graduated from the St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas in 1965, which he attended on scholarship.

===College===
Jones entered Harvard College in 1965 on need-based aid. As an upperclassman, he lived in Dunster House and was roommates with future U.S. Vice President Al Gore and with Bob Somerby, who later became editor of the media criticism site The Daily Howler. Jones majored in English literature and was a pupil of dramatist Robert Chapman. He graduated in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;cum laude&quot;. His senior thesis was on &quot;the mechanics of Catholicism&quot; in the works of Flannery O&#x27;Connor.

====College football====

Jones played guard on the Harvard Crimson football team from 1965 to 1968. He was a member of Harvard&#x27;s undefeated 1968 football team. He was named as a first-team All-Ivy League selection, and played in the 1968 Game. The game featured a memorable and last-minute Harvard 16-point comeback to tie Yale. He recounted his memory of &quot;the most famous football game in Ivy League history&quot; in the documentary &quot;Harvard Beats Yale 29–29&quot;.

==Career==

===Early acting and film (1969–1982)===
After graduating from Harvard in 1969, Jones moved to New York City to become an actor, making his Broadway debut in 1969&#x27;s &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot; in a number of supporting roles. In 1970, he landed his first film role, coincidentally playing a Harvard student in &quot;Love Story&quot; (Erich Segal, the author of &quot;Love Story&quot;, said that he based the lead character of Oliver on aspects of two undergraduate roommates he knew while on a sabbatical at Harvard, Jones and Al Gore).

In early 1971, he returned to Broadway in Abe Burrows&#x27; &quot;Four on a Garden&quot; where he shared the stage with Carol Channing and Sid Caesar. Between 1971 and 1975 he portrayed Dr. Mark Toland on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. He returned to the stage for a short-lived 1974 production of &quot;Ulysses in Nighttown&quot;, an adaptation of one episode from James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, playing Stephen Dedalus opposite Zero Mostel&#x27;s Leopold Bloom and directed by Burgess Meredith. It was followed by the acclaimed TV movie &quot;The Amazing Howard Hughes&quot;, where he played the lead role.

In films, he played a hunted escaped convict in &quot;Jackson County Jail&quot; (1976), a Vietnam veteran in &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1977), an automobile mogul, co-starring with Laurence Olivier, in the Harold Robbins drama &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978), and a police detective opposite Faye Dunaway in the 1978 thriller &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot;.

In 1980, Jones earned his first Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of country singer Loretta Lynn&#x27;s husband, Doolittle &quot;Mooney&quot; Lynn, in &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In 1981, he played a drifter opposite Sally Field in &quot;Back Roads&quot;, a comedy that received middling reviews. In 1982, he co-starred with Tuesday Weld in the HBO adaptation of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, directed by John Frankenheimer.

===Further exposure (1983–2004)===
In 1983, he received an Emmy for Best Actor for his performance as murderer Gary Gilmore in a TV adaptation of Norman Mailer&#x27;s &quot;The Executioner&#x27;s Song&quot;. The same year, he starred in a pirate adventure, &quot;Nate and Hayes&quot;, playing pirate captain Bully Hayes. In 1986, Jones played a former thief working for the FBI in the action thriller &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot;.

In 1988, Jones co-starred with Chad Lowe and Robert Urich in the made-for-TV film &quot;April Morning&quot;, which depicted the battle of Lexington in the American Revolutionary War. In 1989, he earned another Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Texas Ranger Woodrow F. Call in the acclaimed television mini-series &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, based on the best-seller by Larry McMurtry.

In the 1990s, Jones was featured in blockbuster films such as &quot;JFK&quot; (1991) co-starring Kevin Costner (which earned him an Oscar nomination), &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993) co-starring Harrison Ford, &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995) co-starring Val Kilmer, &quot;Volcano&quot; (1997) co-starring Anne Heche, and &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) with Will Smith. His performance as Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; received broad acclaim that included an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and a sequel, &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998). When he accepted his Oscar, his head was shaved for his role in the film &quot;Cobb&quot; (1994), which he made light of in his speech: &quot;The only thing a man can say at a time like this is &#x27;I am not really bald&#x27;. Actually I&#x27;m lucky to be working&quot;.

Among his other well-known performances during the 1990s were those of a terrorist who hijacks a U.S. Navy battleship in &quot;Under Siege&quot; (1992), the role of &quot;Reverend&quot; Roy Foltrigg in &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), a maximum-security prison warden who&#x27;s in way over his head in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), and a parole officer in &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; (1999).

In 2000, Jones co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson as a Marine colonel serving as Jackson&#x27;s defense attorney in the film &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, and co-starred with director Clint Eastwood as astronauts in the film &quot;Space Cowboys&quot;, in which both played retired pilots and friends/rivals leading a space rescue mission together. In 2002, he and Will Smith co-starred in the &quot;Men in Black&quot; sequel, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;.

===Later years (2005–present)===
In 2005, the first theatrical feature film Jones directed, &quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot;, was presented at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. Jones&#x27;s character speaks both English and Spanish in the film. His performance won him the Best Actor Award at Cannes. His first film as a director had been &quot;The Good Old Boys&quot; in 1995, a made-for-television movie.

Two strong performances in 2007 marked a resurgence in Jones&#x27;s career, one as a beleaguered father investigating the disappearance of his soldier son in &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot;, the other as a Texas sheriff hunting an assassin in the Oscar-winning &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;. For the former, he was nominated for an Academy Award.

Jones has been a spokesman for Japanese brewing company Suntory since 2006. He can be seen in various Japanese TV commercials of Suntory&#x27;s Coffee brand Boss as a character called &quot;Alien Jones&quot;, an extraterrestrial who takes the form of a human being to check on the world of humans. Many of these commercials can be seen on YouTube. In 2011, Jones appeared in public service announcements on Japanese television, joining a number of other popular figures who sang two sentimental songs in remembrance of those lost in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

In 2010, Jones appeared alongside Ben Affleck in the recession drama &quot;The Company Men&quot;. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where early reviews praised Jones&#x27;s performance as &quot;pitch-perfect&quot;. Jones had a role in the Marvel Studios film, &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; (2011). He also directed, produced and co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson in an adaptation of &quot;The Sunset Limited&quot; (2011).

In 2012, there was another turning point in Jones&#x27;s career, starting with playing Agent K again in &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, portraying Arnold Soames in the romantic dramedy &quot;Hope Springs&quot;, and co-starring as Thaddeus Stevens in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot;. Jones&#x27;s performance in &quot;Lincoln&quot; received wide critical acclaim, and he was nominated for an Oscar for the fourth time, for Best Supporting Actor. Since &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Jones has continued appearing in popular films, including &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016) and (2019).

==Personal life==
Jones was married to Kate Lardner, the niece of screenwriter and journalist Ring Lardner Jr., from 1971 to 1978. He has two children from his second marriage to Kimberlea Cloughley, the daughter of Phil Hardberger, former mayor of San Antonio. On March 19, 2001, he married his third wife, Dawn Laurel.

Jones resides in Terrell Hills, Texas, a city just outside of downtown San Antonio, and speaks Spanish. He owns a cattle ranch in San Saba County, Texas, and a ranch near Van Horn, Texas, which served as the set for his film &quot;The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada&quot;. He owned an equestrian estate in Wellington, Florida, until he sold it in 2019. Jones is a polo player, and he has a house in a polo country club in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He is a supporter of the Polo Training Foundation. He is an avid San Antonio Spurs fan; he is often seen courtside at Spurs games. At the 2000 Democratic National Convention, he gave the nominating speech for his former college roommate, Al Gore, as the Democratic Party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States.
