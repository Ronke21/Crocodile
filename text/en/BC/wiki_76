<text>Karl August Leopold Böhm (28 August 1894 – 14 August 1981) was an Austrian conductor. He was best known for his performances of the music of Mozart, Wagner, and Richard Strauss.

==Life and career==

=== Education ===
Karl Böhm was born in Graz, Styria, Austria. The son of a lawyer, he studied law and earned a doctorate in this subject before entering the music conservatory in his home town of Graz. He later enrolled at the Vienna Conservatory, where he studied under Eusebius Mandyczewski, a friend of Johannes Brahms.

=== Munich, Darmstadt, Hamburg ===
In 1917, Böhm became a rehearsal assistant in his home town, making his debut as a conductor in Viktor Nessler&#x27;s &quot;Der Trompeter von Säckingen&quot; in 1917. He became the assistant director of music in 1919, and the following year, the senior director. On the recommendation of Karl Muck, Bruno Walter engaged him at the Bavarian State Opera, Munich in 1921. An early assignment here was Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, with a cast which included Maria Ivogün, Paul Bender, and Richard Tauber. In 1927, Böhm was appointed as chief musical director in Darmstadt. In 1931, he was appointed to the same post at the Hamburg State Opera, a position he held until 1934.

=== Vienna, Dresden, Salzburg ===
In 1933, Böhm conducted in Vienna for the first time, in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; by Wagner. In 1934, he succeeded Fritz Busch, who had gone into exile, as head of Dresden&#x27;s Semper Opera remaining there until 1942. This was an important period for him, in which he conducted the first performances of works by Richard Strauss: &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (1935) and &quot;Daphne&quot; (1938), which is dedicated to him. He also conducted the first performances of &quot;Romeo und Julia&quot; (1940) and &quot;Die Zauberinsel&quot; (1942) by Heinrich Sutermeister, and Strauss&#x27;s Horn Concerto No. 2 (1943).

Böhm first appeared at the Salzburg Festival in 1938, conducting &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and thereafter he became a permanent guest conductor. He secured a top post at the Vienna State Opera in 1943, eventually becoming music director. On the occasion of the 80th birthday of Richard Strauss, on 11 June 1944, he conducted the Vienna State Opera performance of &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;.

=== After World War II ===
After he had completed a two-year post-war denazification ban, Böhm led &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at La Scala, Milan (1948) and gave a guest performance in Paris with the Vienna State Opera company (1949). From 1950 to 1953 he directed the German season at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, and he conducted the first performance in Spanish of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; by Alban Berg, translated for the occasion. In 1953 he was responsible for the first performance of Gottfried von Einem&#x27;s work &quot;Der Prozess&quot;. From 1954 to 1956 he directed the Vienna State Opera at its reconstructed home. He additionally resumed ties post-war in Dresden, at the Staatskapelle.

=== Success in New York ===
In 1957, Böhm made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York, conducting &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and quickly became one of the favorite conductors of Rudolf Bing&#x27;s tenure at the Met, conducting 262 performances there, including the Met premieres of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; and &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;, which was the first major success in the Met&#x27;s new house at Lincoln Center in 1966. Böhm led many other major new productions in New York, including &quot;Fidelio&quot; for the 1970 Beethoven bicentennial, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (including the Met debut performance of Birgit Nilsson in 1959), &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Salome&quot;, and &quot;Elektra&quot;. His repertoire there also included &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;, &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, and &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

=== Bayreuth and Wagner ===
Böhm made his debut at the Bayreuth Festival in 1962 with &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, which he conducted until 1970. In 1964, he led Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; there, and from 1965 to 1967 the composer&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; cycle, which was the last production by Wieland Wagner. His Wagner conducting divided opinion; the recording producer John Culshaw wrote that Böhm&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Walküre&quot; &quot;was conducted with a stupefying indifference, as if the conductor could not wait to get back to Salzburg or wherever he was going for his next engagement”, but &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; praises Böhm &#x27;s Bayreuth performances for &quot;finely display[ing] his qualities&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; took a middle view, finding his Wagner &quot;light and positive&quot; but &quot;somewhat reluctant to let the drama find its full weight and depth&quot;. Performances of the &quot;Ring&quot; and &quot;Tristan&quot; were recorded live and issued on record. In 1971 he conducted Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot; at Bayreuth.

=== Indian summer in London ===
Late in life, he began a guest-conducting relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in a 1973 appearance at the Salzburg Festival. Several recordings were made with the orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon. Böhm was given the title of LSO President, which he held until his death. He twice conducted at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in the 1970s: &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in 1979.

=== Death, family, legacy ===
Böhm died in Salzburg, at age 86. He conducted the premieres of Strauss&#x27;s late works &quot;Die schweigsame Frau&quot; (1935) and &quot;Daphne&quot; (1938), of which he is the dedicatee, recorded all the major operas (but often made cuts to the scores), and regularly revived Strauss&#x27;s operas with strong casts during his tenures in Vienna and Dresden, as well as at the Salzburg Festival.

Böhm was praised for his rhythmically robust interpretations of the operas and symphonies of Mozart, and in the 1960s he was entrusted with recording all the Mozart symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic. His brisk, straightforward approach to Wagner won adherents, as did his readings of the symphonies of Brahms, Bruckner, and Schubert. His complete recordings of the Beethoven symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1971 was also highly regarded. On a less common front, he championed and recorded Alban Berg&#x27;s avant-garde operas &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot; before they gained a foothold in the standard repertory. Böhm mentioned in the notes to his recordings of these works that he and Berg discussed the orchestrations, leading to changes in the score (as he had similarly done, previously, with Richard Strauss). He was described by one critic as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century. &quot;Grove&quot; says of him:

He received two exclusive titles: &quot; of the Vienna Philharmonic and Austrian &quot;. He was widely fêted on his 80th birthday ten years later; his colleague Herbert von Karajan presented him with a clock to mark that occasion.

Böhm was married to the soprano Thea Linhard. His son Karlheinz Böhm was a successful actor.

=== Nazi sympathies ===
Although Böhm never joined the Nazi party, in public and in private he continually expressed strong support for Hitler and his regime. The extent to which this was a matter of conviction rather than careerism is uncertain and the subject of much speculation. Böhm&#x27;s son maintained that his father was warned that if he defected from Nazi Germany, every member of his family would be sent to a concentration camp, but Böhm&#x27;s support of the Nazis predated their rise to power. The historian Michael H. Kater records that while Böhm was music director in Dresden (1934–43) he &quot;poured forth rhetoric glorifying the Nazi regime and their cultural aims&quot;. Kater ranks Böhm in that group of artists in whom &quot;we also find conflicting elements of resistance, accommodation, and service to the regime, so that in the end they cannot be definitively painted as either Nazis or non-Nazis.&quot; Kater also argues that Böhm&#x27;s move to the Dresden Opera in 1934, where he replaced Fritz Busch after the latter&#x27;s &quot;politically motivated&quot; dismissal by Nazi authorities, as evidence of Böhm&#x27;s &quot;extreme careerist opportunism at the expense of personal morality&quot; and was facilitated directly by Hitler, who obtained an early release for Böhm from his previous contract. Kater contrasts this conduct with Böhm&#x27;s &quot;aesthetically faultless and sometimes politically daring&quot; choice of repertory, and his collaborations with anti-Nazi directors and designers, which &quot;could have been interpreted by enemies of the Nazi regime as a brave attempt to preserve the principle of artistic freedom&quot;. In 2015, the Salzburg Festival announced that it would affix a plaque in its Karl Böhm refreshment lobby (Karl-Böhm-Saal) acknowledging the conductor&#x27;s complicity with Nazi Germany: &quot;Böhm was a beneficiary of the Third Reich and used its system to advance his career. His ascent was facilitated by the expulsion of Jewish and politically out-of-favor colleagues&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
Böhm&#x27;s awards include: 1943: War Merit Cross, 2nd class without swords (&quot;Kriegsverdienstkreuz II. Klasse ohne Schwerter&quot;); 1959: Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria; 1960: Grand Merit Cross of the Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;Großes Verdienstkreuz&quot;); 1964: Honorary Ring of Vienna; 1967: Berlin Art Prize; 1970: Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art; 1976: Commander of the Legion of Honour; Honorary Ring of Styria; and 2012: Gramophone Magazine Hall of Fame

<text>Sir Colin Rex Davis (25 September 1927 – 14 April 2013) was an English conductor, known for his association with the London Symphony Orchestra, having first conducted it in 1959. His repertoire was broad, but among the composers with whom he was particularly associated were Mozart, Berlioz, Elgar, Sibelius, Stravinsky and Tippett.

Davis studied as a clarinetist, but was intent on becoming a conductor. After struggling as a freelance conductor from 1949 to 1957, he gained a series of appointments with orchestras including the BBC Scottish Orchestra, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. He also held the musical directorships of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera and the Royal Opera House, where he was principal conductor for over fifteen years. His guest conductorships included the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Staatskapelle Dresden, among many others.

As a teacher, Davis held posts at the Royal Academy of Music, London, and the Landesgymnasium für Musik &quot;Carl Maria von Weber&quot; (preparatory school for music) in Dresden. He made his first gramophone recordings in 1958, and his discography over the next five decades was extensive, with many studio recordings for Philips Records and a substantial catalogue of live recordings for the London Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s own label.

==Early years==
Davis was born in Weybridge, Surrey, the fifth of seven children, to Reginald George Davis (a bank clerk) and Lillian Constance (Colbran) Davis. The family was musical, and he was exposed to music from an early age. He recalled:

&quot;I can still see Sargent conducting the first concert I ever attended. I can still hear Melchior in the final scene of &quot;Siegfried&quot; – an old 78 playing on my father&#x27;s gramophone. … I can also remember the moment I decided to make music my life. I was 13 or 14 at the time and the performance was of Beethoven&#x27;s Eighth. Doors were suddenly opened. I became totally involved, even obsessed by music, although I was frightfully enclosed by my likes and dislikes. Today I&#x27;m game for anything.&quot;
With financial assistance from his great-uncle, Davis was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Sussex and then won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in London, where he studied the clarinet with Frederick Thurston. His fellow-students included Gervase de Peyer, but Davis developed a greater interest in conducting. He was, however, not eligible for the conducting class at the college, because he could not play the piano.

Following compulsory military service and completing his studies at college, Davis served as a clarinettist in the band of the Life Guards. Stationed at Windsor, he had continual opportunities to attend concerts in London under conductors including Sir Thomas Beecham and Bruno Walter. In 1949, he began his career as a freelance musician (the &quot;freelance wilderness&quot;, in his own phrase) where he remained until 1957. His first conducting work was with the Kalmar Orchestra, which he co-founded with other former students of the Royal College. He was subsequently invited to conduct the recently founded Chelsea Opera Group in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. In the early years of his career, he also took some engagements as an orchestral clarinettist. What seemed at first to be a full-time conducting appointment, for the Original Ballet Russe in 1952, ended abruptly after three months, when the company collapsed. In between sparse conducting engagements, Davis worked as a coach and lecturer, including spells at the Cambridge University Musical Society and the Bryanston Summer School, where a performance of &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; awakened his love of Berlioz&#x27;s music.

==BBC and Sadler&#x27;s Wells==
His first breakthrough came in 1957 when, at his third attempt, he secured the post of assistant conductor of the BBC Scottish Orchestra (now the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra). The chief conductor of the orchestra generally chose to conduct the standard repertoire pieces himself, and left Davis with modern works and non-standard repertoire works, including those of Berlioz. By 1959, Davis had developed to the extent that, after a concert of Stravinsky and Mozart with the London Mozart Players, the chief music critic of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Peter Heyworth, wrote:

: &quot;Mr Davis conducted two works in a manner that showed that he is not only outstanding among our younger conductors, but probably the best we have produced since Sir Thomas Beecham, his senior by forty-eight years.&quot;
Davis first found wide acclaim when he stood in for an ill Otto Klemperer in a performance of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, at the Royal Festival Hall in 1959. A year later, Beecham invited him to collaborate with him in preparing &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; at Glyndebourne. Beecham was taken ill, and Davis conducted the opera. After the &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;A superb conductor of Mozart declared himself last night at the Festival Hall…. Mr Davis emerged as a conductor ripe for greatness.&quot; Neville Cardus in &quot;The Guardian&quot; was less enthusiastic but nevertheless considered that he &quot;had his triumphs&quot; in the performance. After &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; called Davis &quot;master of Mozart&#x27;s idiom, style and significance&quot;, although Heyworth in &quot;The Observer&quot; was disappointed by his tempi, judging them to be too slow.

In 1960, Davis made his début at the Proms in a programme of Britten, Schumann, Mozart and Berlioz. In the same year, he was appointed chief conductor of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera, and in 1961 he was made musical director of the company, with whom he built up a large repertoire of operas, conducting in London and on tour. &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; wrote of this period, &quot;He excelled in &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, and &quot;Fidelio&quot;; his Wagner, Verdi and Puccini were less successful. He introduced Weill&#x27;s &quot;Mahagonny&quot;, and Pizzetti&#x27;s &quot;Assassinio nella cattedrale&quot; to the British public and conducted the première of Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Mines of Sulphur&quot; (1965).&quot; Together with the stage director Glen Byam Shaw, he worked to present operas in a way that gave due weight to the drama as well as the music. In his early years, Davis was known as something of a firebrand with a short fuse in rehearsals, and his departure from Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1965 was not without acrimony.

After he left Sadler&#x27;s Wells, and being passed over as principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, Davis was named chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO), effective September 1967. At first, in the general view of the public, his tenure was overshadowed, at least during the Proms, by the memory of Sir Malcolm Sargent. Compared to the &quot;suave father figure&quot; image of Sargent to the promenaders, it took some time for the much younger Davis to be accepted. The BBC&#x27;s official historian of the Proms later wrote, &quot;Davis never really identified himself with the Proms in the way that Sargent had done. Davis was uncomfortable with the traditional hullabaloo of the Last Night of the Proms and attempted, unsuccessfully, to modernise it. The BBC&#x27;s Controller of Music, William Glock, was a long-standing admirer of Davis, and encouraged him to put on adventurous programmes, with a new emphasis on modern music, both at the Proms and throughout the rest of the orchestra&#x27;s annual schedule. Following his tenure as BBC SO chief conductor, Davis served as chief guest conductor of the BBC SO from 1971 to 1976.

==Covent Garden==
In 1970, Sir David Webster, who ran the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet companies at Covent Garden, invited Davis to succeed Sir Georg Solti as principal conductor of the opera. At about the same time, the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director, but Davis felt that if Covent Garden needed him, it was his duty to take on the post. Webster&#x27;s vision was that Davis and the stage director Sir Peter Hall, formerly of the Royal Shakespeare Company, would work in equal partnership as musical director and director of productions. After early successes together, including the première of Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; in December 1970, Hall left to succeed Laurence Olivier as director of the National Theatre. Webster had retired by that time, leaving Davis, together with Webster&#x27;s successor as General Administrator, Sir John Tooley, to run the Royal Opera.
Davis&#x27; early months in charge at Covent Garden were marked by dissatisfaction among some of the audience, and booing was heard at a &quot;disastrous&quot; &quot;Nabucco&quot; in 1972. His conducting of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle was at first compared unfavourably with that of his predecessor. Among his successes were Berlioz&#x27;s massive &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (with Jon Vickers and Anja Silja) and &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, the major Mozart operas, and, as one critic put it, he &quot;confirmed his preeminence as a Britten and Stravinsky interpreter&quot; with productions of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Davis conducted more than 30 operas during his fifteen-year tenure, but &quot;since people like Maazel, Abbado and Muti would only come for new productions&quot;, Davis yielded the baton to these foreign conductors, giving up the chance to conduct several major operas, including &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Rigoletto&quot; and &quot;Aida&quot;.

In addition to the standard operatic repertoire, Davis conducted a number of modern and unfamiliar operas, including Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; and &quot;The Ice Break&quot; (of which he is the dedicatee), and Alexander Zemlinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Eine florentinische Tragödie&quot;. With later stage directors at Covent Garden, Davis preferred to work with those who respected the libretto: &quot;I have a hankering for producers who don&#x27;t feel jealous of composers for being better than they are, and want to impose their, often admittedly clever, ideas on the work in hand.&quot; Davis hoped that Götz Friedrich, with whom he worked on Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, would take on the role of principal producer vacated by Hall, &quot;but it seemed that nobody wanted to commit themselves.&quot;

During his Covent Garden tenure, Davis returned to the BBC Symphony Orchestra as principal guest conductor from 1971 to 1975, and held the same post with the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1972 to 1984. In 1977, he became the first English conductor to appear at Bayreuth, where he conducted the opening opera of the festival, &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Despite the Bayreuth habitués&#x27; suspicion of newcomers, his &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; was &quot;highly successful&quot;. He debuted at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, in 1967 with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, the Vienna State Opera in 1986 and the Bavarian State Opera in 1994.

==Bavarian Radio Symphony and London Symphony Orchestras==
From 1983 to 1993, Davis was chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, with whom he developed his concert hall repertoire, including symphonies by Bruckner and Mahler. He was offered but declined the music directorships of the Cleveland Orchestra in succession to Maazel and the New York Philharmonic in succession to Zubin Mehta. As a principal guest conductor he was associated with the Dresden Staatskapelle, which appointed him honorary conductor (&quot;Ehrendirigent&quot;) in 1990, the first in the orchestra&#x27;s 460-year-history, and whose musicians referred to Davis with the nickname &quot;Der Sir&quot;. From 1998 to 2003, he was principal guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic.

In 1995, Davis was appointed principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, the culmination of a long association with the orchestra. He had first conducted the LSO in 1959, and in 1964 he headed the orchestra&#x27;s first world tour. He became principal guest conductor in 1975 and was at the helm in the LSO&#x27;s first major series at its new home, the Barbican Centre, in a Berlioz/Tippett festival in 1983. In 1997 he conducted the LSO&#x27;s first residency at Lincoln Center in New York City. Davis was the longest-serving principal conductor in the history of the LSO, holding the post from 1995 until 2006, after which the orchestra appointed him its President, an honour previously held only by Arthur Bliss, William Walton, Karl Böhm and Leonard Bernstein. On 21 June 2009, 50 years to the day after his first LSO performance, a special concert was given at the Barbican, at which present-day players were joined by many past members of the orchestra. His programme for the concert was Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No 40 in G minor, and Brahms&#x27;s Piano Concerto No 2, with Nelson Freire as soloist.

During his time with the LSO, both as principal conductor and later as president, Davis conducted series and cycles of the music of Sibelius, Berlioz, Bruckner, Mozart, Elgar, Beethoven, and Brahms, and in 2009 began presenting a cycle of the symphonies of Carl Nielsen. &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; wrote:

: &quot;He conducted a Sibelius cycle in 1992 and a concert performance of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; the following year, both of which have become the stuff of legend. More recently he has added grand performances of Bruckner, Richard Strauss and Elgar, the première of Tippett&#x27;s last major work, &quot;The Rose Lake&quot; (1995), and a Berlioz cycle begun with &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; in 1999 and crowned by an incandescent &quot;Les Troyens&quot; in December 2000, all confirming his partnership with the LSO as one of the most important of its time.&quot;

==Teacher==
Davis was president of the Landesgymnasium für Musik &quot;Carl Maria von Weber&quot; in Dresden, and held the International Chair of Orchestral Studies at the Royal Academy of Music, London. Jonathan Freeman-Attwood, principal of the academy, wrote of Davis:

: &quot;As the Academy&#x27;s International Chair of Conducting over 25 years, Sir Colin helmed six opera productions and over sixty concerts, classes and chamber music projects. Such extraordinary generosity from a major international conductor is surely unique. He inspired a whole generation here, as did Henry Wood and John Barbirolli before him.&quot;

==Recordings==
Davis&#x27;s discography is extensive, numbering over 300 recordings. He made his first record in 1958 conducting the Sinfonia of London in performances of Mozart&#x27;s Symphonies 29 and 39 for World Record Club (TZ 130). This was followed on 8 May 1959 by a recording made in Kingsway Hall, London, for Decca with the New Symphony Orchestra of London and pianist Peter Katin performing Rachmaninov&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor Op. 18. He made several records for the small independent label L&#x27;Oiseau Lyre, including a 1960 &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; and a 1962 &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; which, at April 2013, were both still available on CD. For EMI he made both operatic and orchestral recordings, the former with Sadler&#x27;s Wells forces, including excerpts from &quot;Carmen&quot; and a complete &quot;Oedipus rex&quot;, and the latter including &quot;Harold in Italy&quot; with Yehudi Menuhin, and what remains one of his best-known recordings, a 1961 Beethoven Seventh Symphony.

===Philips and RCA===
In the 1960s, Davis signed as an exclusive artist for Philips Records, with whom he made an extensive range of recordings in the symphonic repertoire and many operatic recordings, including the major Mozart operas; operas by Tippett, Britten, Verdi and Puccini; and a comprehensive survey of the operas of Berlioz, culminating in an award-winning first recording of the complete &quot;Les Troyens&quot; issued in May 1970.

Davis&#x27;s 1966 Philips recording of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; was regarded as revelatory at the time of its issue for its departure from the large-scale Victorian-style performances that had previously been customary. Other Philips recordings included a 1982 set of Haydn&#x27;s twelve London symphonies with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra &quot;distinguished by performances of tremendous style and authority, and a sense of rhythmic impetus that is most exhilarating&quot;; and a 1995 Beethoven symphony cycle with the Dresden Staatskapelle, of which &quot;Gramophone&quot; wrote, &quot;There has not been a Beethoven cycle like this since Klemperer&#x27;s heyday.&quot;

Davis made a number of records with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for Philips, including the first of his three Sibelius cycles, which remains in the CD catalogues. They also recorded works by Debussy, Grieg, Schubert, Schumann, and Tchaikovsky.

For RCA Victor Red Seal, Davis recorded complete symphony cycles of Sibelius (with the LSO), Brahms (Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, 1989–98), and Schubert (Dresden Staatskapelle, 1996).

===LSO Live===

Davis&#x27;s term as principal conductor of the LSO coincided with the orchestra&#x27;s decision to launch its own record label, LSO Live. Davis&#x27; recordings on the LSO Live label include Beethoven&#x27;s opera &quot;Fidelio&quot; (2006), a wide range of Berlioz works, including a second recording of &quot;Les Troyens&quot; (2000), &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot; (2000), &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (2000), &quot;Béatrice et Bénédict&quot; (2000), &quot;Harold en Italie&quot; (2003), and the &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; (2000); Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; (2004); Dvořák&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 6–9 (1999–2004); five Elgar sets: the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; (2007) and the &quot;Introduction and Allegro for Strings&quot; (2005), the three symphonies (2001), and &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; (2005); Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; (2006); Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Die Schöpfung&quot; (2007); Holst&#x27;s &quot;The Planets&quot; (2002); James MacMillan&#x27;s &quot;St John Passion&quot;, (2008) &quot;The World&#x27;s Ransoming&quot; and &quot;The Confession of Isobel Gowdie&quot; (2007); Mozart&#x27;s Requiem (2007); Nielsen&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 4–5 (2011); a third Sibelius symphony cycle (2002–2008); Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Má vlast&quot; (2005); Tippett&#x27;s &quot;A Child of Our Time&quot; (2007), Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; (2004), Requiem (2009), and &quot;Otello&quot; (2010); and Walton&#x27;s First Symphony (2005).

==Awards==
Davis was appointed CBE in 1965, knighted in 1980 and appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2001. He was awarded the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s gold medal in 1995, the Queen&#x27;s Medal for Music, 2009, and has numerous international awards, including Commendatore of the Republic of Italy, 1976; Shakespeare Prize (Germany), 1984; Commander&#x27;s Cross, Order of Merit (Germany), 1987; Commandeur, l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France), 1990; Commander, Order of the Lion (Finland), 1992; Order of Merit (Bavaria), 1993; Officier, Légion d&#x27;honneur (France), 1999 (Chevalier, 1982); Order of Maximilian (Bavaria), 2000.

Other awards include Pipe Smoker of the Year in 1996, Male Artist of the Year in the Classic Brit Awards 2008, the Grammy Award in 2006 for Best Opera for his LSO Live recording of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, and the Elgar Medal in 2012.

He won a total of 10 Grammy Awards and 34 nominations during his career.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Davis married the soprano April Cantelo. They had two children. Their marriage ended in 1964, and in that same year, Davis married Ashraf Naini, known as Shamsi. To satisfy both the Iranian and British authorities, the couple were married three times, once in Iran and twice in the UK, in the Iranian Embassy in London as well as in a UK civil ceremony; they had five children. One of their children is the conductor Joseph Wolfe, who chose a different surname, because he wanted to &quot;create some space to grow and develop my own identity as a musician&quot;.

Shamsi died in June 2010 at the time Davis was conducting Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; at the Royal Opera House. Davis continued the run of performances just days later and when asked, the following year, how he had the strength to perform, he replied:

:It comes from the music. There is so much negative nonsense talked about Mozart, but he is – well, he&#x27;s life itself.

===Illness and death===
After his wife&#x27;s death, Davis&#x27;s health declined rapidly. He fell from the podium at Covent Garden in February 2011, and cancelled many engagements in the subsequent months. His last concert in France was on 7 June 2012 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris with the Orchestre National de France and Emanuel Ax. His last concert with the LSO was a performance of Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Grande Messe des morts&quot; on 26 June 2012 at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. His last known performance was with the Haydn Chamber Orchestra, an amateur London orchestra, and soloist Thomas Gould, a month before his death. On 14 April 2013, Davis died in London at the age of 85.

Antonio Pappano, music director at the Royal Opera House, said Davis&#x27;s death came as a &quot;huge blow&quot;. Labour MP Harriet Harman tweeted that Davis had &quot;made a historic contribution to music – in this country &amp; worldwide&quot;, while Borjan Canev, former assistant conductor to Davis, said &quot;thank you for being my inspiration&quot;.

<text>A Gamut of Games is an innovative book of games written by Sid Sackson and first published in 1969. It contains rules for a large number of paper and pencil, card, and board games. Many of the games in the book had never before been published. It is considered by many hobbyist gamers to be an essential text for anyone interested in abstract strategy games, and a number of the rules were later expanded into full-fledged published board games.

Some of the games which were later sold separately include Focus, Property and Origins of World War I; Robert Abbott expanded his game Crossings, published here, into the more-refined title Epaminondas. Many of the games covered in the book were creations of Sid Sackson himself, who was a prolific game designer.

==Book sections==
The sections of the book and the games covered therein are as follows:

===In Search of Big and Little Games===
*&quot;Blue and Gray&quot;, a board game by Henry Busch and Arthur Jaeger
*&quot;Hekaton&quot;, a card game originally published along with &quot;Yankee Notion Cards&quot; from the 19th century
*&quot;Le Truc&quot;, a revived French card game
*&quot;Mate&quot;, a card game by G. Capellen
*&quot;Plank&quot;, a serious revamp of the concepts in Tic-Tac-Toe
*Zetema, a Victorian card game similar to Bezique

===Game Inventors Are People Too===
*&quot;Crossings&quot;, a board game by Robert Abbott; later turned into Epaminondas
*&quot;Cups&quot;, a mancala variant by Arthur and Wald Amberstone

<doc id="251386" wikidata="Q621613" url="?curid=251386" title="Bounty hunter">
<text>A bounty hunter is a private agent working for a bail bondsman who captures fugitives or criminals for a commission or bounty. The occupation, officially known as a bail enforcement agent or fugitive recovery agent, has traditionally operated outside the legal constraints that govern police officers and other agents of the state. This is because a bail agreement between a defendant and a bail bondsman is essentially a civil contract that is incumbent upon the bondsman to enforce. Since they are not police officers, bounty hunters are exposed to legal liabilities from which agents of the state are protected as these immunities enable police to perform their functions effectively without fear of lawsuits. Everyday citizens approached by a bounty hunter are neither required to answer their questions nor allowed to be detained. Bounty hunters are typically independent contractors paid a commission of the total bail amount that is owed by the fugitive; they provide their own professional liability insurance and only get paid if they are able to find the &quot;skip&quot; and bring them in.

Bounty hunting is a vestige of common law which was created during the Middle Ages. In the United States, bounty hunters primarily draw their legal imprimatur from an 1872 Supreme Court decision, &quot;Taylor v. Taintor&quot;. The practice historically existed in many parts of the world; however, as of the 21st century, it is found almost exclusively in the United States as the practice is illegal under the laws of most other countries. State laws vary widely as to the legality of the practice; Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon, and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds, while Wyoming offers few (if any) regulations governing the practice.

==United States==
===History===
====Before the Civil War====
====The Old West====
In 1873, the Supreme Court noted that bounty hunters were a part of the U.S. law enforcement system with a decision in &quot;Taylor v. Taintor&quot;:

Bounty hunters at the time were used to catch wanted criminals and children who ran away from the American Indian Boarding Schools.

====Modern times====
In modern times, bounty hunters carry out arrests mostly of those who have skipped bail or whose bail has been revoked; but are often referred to as and typically prefer to be identified by more formal titles such as &quot;bail enforcement agents&quot; or &quot;fugitive recovery agents&quot;.

When undertaking arrest warrants, agents may wear bullet-resistant vests, badges, and other clothing bearing the inscription &quot;bail enforcement agent&quot; or similar titles. Many agents arm themselves with firearms, or sometimes with less lethal weapons, such as tasers, batons, tear gas (CS gas, pepper spray), or pepper spray projectiles.

In the United States, the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents is the professional association representing this industry.

== Domestic practice ==

Bounty hunters in the United States are employed by bail bondsmen. The bounty hunter is usually paid about 10% of the total bail amount, but this commission can vary on an individual, case-by-case basis, usually depending upon the difficulty level of the assignment and the approach used to exonerate the bail bond. If the fugitive eludes bail, the bondsman, not the bounty hunter, is responsible for 100% of the total bail amount. This is a way of ensuring clients arrive at trial. As of 2003, bounty hunters claimed to catch 31,500 bail jumpers per year, about 90% of people who jump bail.

Bounty hunters have varying levels of authority in their duties with regard to their targets, depending on which states they operate in. Barring restrictions applicable state by state, a bounty hunter may enter the fugitive&#x27;s legal residence without any warrant, besides the original bail bonds contract signed by the fugitive, to execute a re-arrest.

In some states, bounty hunters do not undergo any formal training, and are generally unlicensed, only requiring sanction from a bail bondsman to operate. In other states, however, they are held to varying standards of training and license. State legal requirements are often imposed on out-of-state bounty hunters, so a fugitive could temporarily escape rearrest by entering a state in which the bail agent has limited or no jurisdiction.

===Laws and regulation===
In the United States legal system, the 1873 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Taylor v. Taintor&quot;, 16 Wall (83 U.S. 366, 21 L.Ed. 287), is cited as having established that the person into whose custody an accused is remanded as part of the accuser&#x27;s bail has sweeping rights to that person. Though this may have been accurate at the time the decision was reached, the portion cited was obiter dictum and has no binding precedential value.

As of 2008, four states, Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon, and Wisconsin, prohibited the practice, as they have abolished commercial bail bonds and banned the commercial bail bonds industry within their borders. As of 2012, Nebraska and Maine similarly prohibit surety bail bonds. The states of Texas and California require a license to engage in bounty hunting while other states may have no restrictions.

There have been some states that have rolled out specific laws that govern bounty hunting. For example, Minnesota laws provide that a bounty hunter cannot drive a white, black, maroon, or dark green vehicle, or wear any colors that are reserved for the police in the state (e.g. maroon, which is worn by the Minnesota Highway Patrol).

====Connecticut====
The State of Connecticut has a detailed licensing process which requires any person who wants to engage in the business as a bail enforcement agent (bounty hunter) to first obtain a professional license from the Commissioner of Public Safety; specifically detailing that &quot;No person shall, as surety on a bond in a criminal proceeding or as an agent of such surety, engage in the business of taking or attempting to take into custody the principal on the bond who has failed to appear in court and for whom a re-arrest warrant or capias has been issued unless such person is licensed as a bail enforcement agent&quot;. Connecticut has strict standards which require bail enforcement agents to pass an extensive background check and, while engaging in fugitive recovery operations, wear a uniform, notify the local police barrack, wear a badge, and only carry licensed and approved firearms, including handguns and long guns which are permitted. Recently, the Connecticut State Police converted its bail enforcement agent licensing unit to reflect the role bail enforcement agents play in the Connecticut criminal justice system; placing them in the newly defined Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection.

Several schools in Connecticut have obtained certification by the Connecticut State Police to pre-license bail enforcement agents in a minimum of 20 hours of criminal justice training and a minimum of eight hours of firearms training. Some of the more advanced schools offer specialized training in the area of tactical firearms to prepare BEAs for conducting dangerous recovery operations.

====Florida====
In Florida, only a &quot;limited surety agent&quot; licensed by the Florida Department of Financial Services - Bureau of Agent and Agency Licensing, may legally apprehend bail fugitives in addition to law enforcement&#x27;s ability to arrest a fugitive pursuant to a bench warrant. According to the Chapter 648 of Florida Statute regarding Bail Bond Agents, &quot;A person may not represent himself or herself to be a bail enforcement agent, bounty hunter, or other similar title in this state.&quot;

====Louisiana====
Louisiana requires bounty hunters to wear clothing identifying them as such.

====Nevada====
A Nevada bounty hunter is referred to as a bail enforcement agent or bail enforcement solicitor. In order to meet state requirements, the bail agent must complete a minimum 80 hours of training (or a POST certification), and that they pass the required examinations and obtain a bail enforcement agent license by the Nevada Division of Insurance within nine months of employment. To acquire such license, one must be at least 21 years old, a United States citizen, have a high school diploma or equivalent, and undergo the required training and pass a state examination.

====Texas====
A Texas bounty hunter is required to be a peace officer, Level III (armed) security officer, or a private investigator.

== International action by U.S. bounty hunters ==

International extradition exists only by authority of an international treaty with the nation where the fugitive is located. Extradition treaties limit extradition to certain offenses and not all fugitives can be
extradited. Generally, the crime being charged against the fugitive must be recognized as a crime in the jurisdiction from which extradition is being sought.

Bail fugitive recovery agents may run into serious legal problems if they try to apprehend fugitives outside the United States, where they have no legal authority to arrest, and taking a person into custody could be charged as kidnapping or some other serious crime. While the United States government and most states recognize a bail agent or fugitive recovery agent&#x27;s powers of arrest, the governments in other countries, including sovereign Native American territories within the United States, do not recognize a bail agent&#x27;s or fugitive recovery agent&#x27;s powers of arrest.

Bounty hunter Duane &quot;Dog&quot; Chapman, star of the TV series &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot;, was arrested in Mexico after he apprehended the multi-millionaire rapist and fugitive Andrew Luster. Chapman was subsequently released, but was later declared a fugitive by a Mexican prosecutor and was subsequently arrested in the United States to be extradited back to Mexico. All charges were later dropped due to the crime passing the statute of limitations date. Chapman has maintained that under Mexico&#x27;s citizen arrest law, he and his crew acted under proper policy.

===Legal action against bounty hunters===
Daniel Kear of Fairfax, Virginia, pursued and abducted Sidney Jaffe at a residence in Canada and returned him to Florida to face trial. Kear was extradited to Canada in 1983, and convicted of kidnapping.

Several bounty hunters have been arrested for killing a fugitive or apprehending the wrong individuals.

Unlike police officers, they have no legal protections against injuries to non-fugitives and few legal protections against injuries to their targets.

In a Texas case, bounty hunters Richard James and his partner DG Pearson were arrested in 2001 for felony charges during an arrest. The charges were levied by the fugitive and his family, but were later dismissed against the hunters after the fugitive&#x27;s wife shot a deputy sheriff in another arrest attempt of the fugitive by the county sheriff&#x27;s department. The hunters sued the fugitive and family, winning the civil suit for malicious prosecution with a judgment amount of $1.5 million.

<doc id="251388" wikidata="Q154895" url="?curid=251388" title="Herbert von Karajan">
<text>Herbert von Karajan (; born &quot;Heribert Adolf Ernst Karajan&quot;; 5 April 1908 – 16 July 1989) was an Austrian conductor. He was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic for 34 years. During the Nazi era, he debuted at the Salzburg Festival, with the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, and during World War II he conducted at the Berlin State Opera. Generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, he was a controversial but dominant figure in European classical music from the mid-1950s until his death. Part of the reason for this was the large number of recordings he made and their prominence during his lifetime. By one estimate, he sold an estimated 200 million records.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
==== Genealogy ====
The Karajans were of Greek ancestry. Herbert&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Georg Karajan (Geórgios Karajánnis, ), was born in Kozani, in the Ottoman province of Rumelia (now in Greece), leaving for Vienna in 1767, and eventually Chemnitz, Electorate of Saxony.

Georg and his brother participated in the establishment of Saxony&#x27;s cloth industry, and both were ennobled for their services by Frederick Augustus III on 1 June 1792, thus adding the prefix &quot;von&quot; to the family name. This usage disappeared with the abolition of Austrian nobility after World War I. The surname Karajánnis became &quot;Karajan&quot;. Although traditional biographers ascribed a Slovak and Serbian or simply a Slavic origin to his mother, Karajan&#x27;s family from the maternal side, through his grandfather who was born in the village of Mojstrana, Duchy of Carniola (today in Slovenia), was Slovene. Aromanian heritage has also been claimed. Through the Slovene line, Karajan was related to the Slovenian-Austrian composer Hugo Wolf. He also seems to have known some Slovene.

==== Childhood and education ====
Herbert Ritter von Karajan was born in Salzburg, Austria-Hungary, the second son of physician (surgeon) and senior consultant Ernst von Karajan (1868–1951) and Marta (née Martha Kosmač; 1881–1954) (married 1905). He was a child prodigy at the piano. From 1916 to 1926, he studied at the Mozarteum in Salzburg with (piano), Franz Sauer (harmony), and Bernhard Paumgartner (composition and chamber music).

He was encouraged to concentrate on conducting by Paumgartner, who detected his exceptional promise in that regard. In 1926, Karajan graduated from the conservatory and continued his studies at the Vienna Academy, studying piano with Josef Hofmann (a teacher with the same name as the pianist) and conducting with Alexander Wunderer and Franz Schalk.

=== Career ===

==== Early engagement ====
Karajan made his debut as a conductor in Salzburg on 22 January 1929. The performance got the attention of the general manager of the Stadttheater in Ulm and led to Karajan&#x27;s first appointment as assistant &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the theater. His senior colleague in Ulm was Otto Schulmann. After Schulmann was forced to leave Germany in 1933 with the Nazi Party takeover, Karajan was promoted to first &quot;Kapellmeister&quot;.

====Nazi years====
In the postwar era, Karajan maintained silence about his Nazi Party membership, which gave rise to a number of conflicting stories about it. One version is that because of the changing political climate and the destabilization of his position, Karajan attempted to join the Nazi Party in Salzburg in April 1933, but his membership was later declared invalid because he somehow failed to follow up on the application and that Karajan formally joined the Nazi Party in Aachen in 1935, implying that he was not eager to pursue membership. More recent scholarship clears up this confusion:
During the entire Nazi era he &quot;never hesitated to open his concerts with the Nazi favorite &#x27;Horst-Wessel-Lied&#x27;, but &quot;always maintained he joined strictly for career reasons.&quot; His enemies called him &quot;SS Colonel von Karajan&quot;.

In 1933, Karajan made his conducting debut at the Salzburg Festival with the &quot;Walpurgisnacht Scene&quot; in Max Reinhardt&#x27;s production of &quot;Faust&quot;. In Salzburg in 1934, Karajan led the Vienna Philharmonic for the first time, and from 1934 to 1941, he was engaged to conduct operatic and orchestra concerts at the Theater Aachen.

Karajan&#x27;s career received a significant boost in 1935 when he became Germany&#x27;s youngest &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot;, at Aachen, and performed as a guest conductor in Bucharest, Brussels, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Paris. In 1938, Karajan made his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic. That same year, he made his debut with the Berlin State Opera conducting &quot;Fidelio,&quot; and then had a major success at the State Opera with &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. His performance was hailed by a Berlin critic as &quot;&quot; (Karajan the miracle). The critic wrote that Karajan&#x27;s &quot;success with Wagner&#x27;s demanding work &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; sets himself alongside Wilhelm Furtwängler and Victor de Sabata, the greatest opera conductors in Germany at the present time&quot;. Receiving a contract with Deutsche Grammophon that same year, Karajan made the first of numerous recordings, conducting the Staatskapelle Berlin in the overture to &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;.

==== World War II ====

Karajan&#x27;s career continued to thrive at the beginning of the war. In 1939, the Berlin State Opera appointed him State Kapellmeister and conductor of concerts by the Prussian State Orchestra. He then became music director of the Staatskapelle Berlin, with which he toured Rome with extraordinary success. The next year, his contract in Aachen was discontinued. His marriage to Anita Gütermann (with one Jewish grandparent) and the prosecution of his agent Rudolf Vedder also contributed to his temporary professional decline, leaving him few engagements beyond a limited season of concerts with the Staatskapelle.

By 1944, Karajan was, by his account, losing favour with the Nazi leadership, but he conducted concerts in Berlin as late as 18 February 1945. A short time later, in the closing stages of the war, he and his wife fled Germany for Milan, relocating with the assistance of Victor de Sabata.

Karajan&#x27;s increased prominence from 1933 to 1945 has led to speculation that he joined the Nazi Party solely to advance his career. Critics such as Jim Svejda have pointed out that other prominent conductors, such as Arturo Toscanini, Otto Klemperer, Erich Kleiber, and Fritz Busch, fled Germany or Italy at the time. Richard Osborne noted that among the many significant conductors who continued to work in Germany during the war years—Wilhelm Furtwängler, Carl Schuricht, Karl Böhm, Hans Knappertsbusch, Clemens Krauss and Karl Elmendorff—Karajan was one of the youngest and thus one of the least advanced in his career. He was allowed to conduct various orchestras and was free to travel, even to the Netherlands to conduct the Concertgebouw Orchestra and make recordings there in 1943. He conducted for an audience of 300 Nazi armaments officials at a conference convened by Albert Speer in Linz, Austria, on 24–25 June 1944. In September 1944, he was listed on the &quot;Gottbegnadeten&quot; list (God-gifted list of artists exempt from mobilisation).

Karajan&#x27;s denazification tribunal, held in Vienna on 15 March 1946, cleared him of illegal activity during the Nazi period. The Austrian denazification examining board discharged Karajan on 18 March 1946, and he resumed conducting shortly thereafter. Years later, former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said of Karajan&#x27;s Nazi party membership card, &quot;Karajan was obviously not a Nazi. He was a .&quot;

==== Postwar years ====
In 1946, Karajan gave his first postwar concert in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic, but was banned from further conducting by the Soviet occupation authorities because of his Nazi party membership. That summer he participated anonymously in the Salzburg Festival.

On 28 October 1947, Karajan gave his first public concert following the lifting of the conducting ban. With the Vienna Philharmonic and the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, he performed Johannes Brahms&#x27;s &quot;A German Requiem&quot; for a gramophone production in Vienna.

In 1949, Karajan became artistic director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Vienna. He also conducted at La Scala in Milan. His most prominent activity at this time was recording with the newly formed Philharmonia Orchestra in London, helping to build them into one of the world&#x27;s finest. Starting from this year, Karajan began his lifelong attendance at the Lucerne Festival.

In 1951 and 1952, Karajan conducted at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus.

====West Berlin appointment====
During its 1955 tour of the United States, Karajan&#x27;s past membership in the Nazi Party led to the Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s concerts being banned in Detroit, and Philadelphia Orchestra music director Eugene Ormandy refused to shake Karajan&#x27;s hand. Upon arriving in New York City for a concert at Carnegie Hall, Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic were confronted by protests and picketers.

In 1956, Karajan was appointed principal conductor for life of the Berlin Philharmonic as Furtwängler&#x27;s successor.

From 1957 to 1964, Karajan was artistic director of the Vienna State Opera. He was closely involved with the Vienna Philharmonic and the Salzburg Festival, where he initiated the Easter Festival, which remained tied to the Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s music director after his tenure.

====Last years====

In his later years, Karajan suffered from heart and back problems, needing surgery on the latter. He resigned as principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic on 24 April 1989. His last concert was Bruckner&#x27;s 7th Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic. He died of a heart attack at his home in Anif on 16 July 1989 at the age of 81.

Karajan believed in reincarnation and said he would like to be reborn as an eagle so he could soar over his beloved Alps. Even so, on 29 June 1985, he conducted Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Coronation Mass during a Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, and with his wife and daughters received Holy Communion from the hand of the Pope. By the end of his life he had reconciled with the Catholic Church, and requested a Catholic burial.

=== Personal life ===
==== Marriages and children ====
Karajan was married three times. Karajan married his first wife, Elmy Holgerloef, an operetta singer, on 26 July 1938. He first worked with her on a 1935 New Year&#x27;s Eve gala production of Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. They divorced in 1942. Elmy died of heart failure in 1983. A statement from his Salzburg office stated that Karajan was &quot;very shocked, affected, and deeply upset by the news. He had never forgotten her; she had been a part of his life.&quot; Karajan did not attend her funeral in Aachen.

On 22 October 1942, at the height of the Second World War, Karajan married his second wife, Anna Maria &quot;Anita&quot; Sauest, born , the daughter of a well-known manufacturer of yarn for sewing machines. Having had a Jewish grandfather, she was considered a &quot;Vierteljüdin&quot; (one-quarter Jewish woman). They divorced in 1958.

On 6 October 1958, Karajan married his third wife, Eliette Mouret, a French model born in Mollans-sur-Ouvèze. She had enjoyed a carefree childhood growing up in Provence before being discovered by Christian Dior when she was 18. This laid the foundation for an international modelling career. Karajan first met Mouret in 1957 and was deeply taken with her. Their first daughter, Isabel, was born on 25 June 1960. In 1964, their second daughter, Arabel, was born.

After Karajan&#x27;s death, Eliette continued his musical legacy by founding of the Herbert von Karajan Centre in Vienna, now in Salzburg and known as the Eliette and Herbert von Karajan Institute. Her numerous projects focus particularly on the development of young people, and she is a patron of the Salzburg Easter Festival.

==== Hobbies ====

Karajan had been a passionate sportsman since he was a teenager. He was a keen skier and swimmer and followed a daily yoga ritual. He won several regattas aboard his racing yacht, christened &quot;Helisara&quot;. He piloted his Learjet and was a great sailing and car enthusiast, particularly fond of Porsches. He ordered a specially configured Porsche 911 Turbo (type 930) with Martini &amp; Rossi livery and his name on the back.

== Musicianship ==
One of Karajan&#x27;s signature skills as a conductor was his ability to extract exquisite sounds from orchestras. His biographer Roger Vaughan observed this phenomenon while listening to the Berlin Philharmonic play in 1986, after nearly 30 years under Karajan&#x27;s direction, noting that &quot;what rivets one&#x27;s attention is the beauty and perfection of the sounds. The softest of pianissimos commands rapt attention. The smooth crescendos peak exactly when they should. The breaks are sliced clean, without the slightest ragged edge.&quot;

=== Conducting style ===
Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Karajan&#x27;s conducting style was his propensity to conduct with his eyes closed. This is highly unusual for a conductor, as eye contact is generally regarded as of paramount importance to the conductor&#x27;s communication with the orchestra. Yet, as Vaughan remarked: &quot;[h]ere is one of the fascinating aspects of conducting: there are no rules, only guidelines. The most eccentric approach is tolerated if the results are successful.&quot; Indeed, James Galway, who served as principal flutist of the Berlin Philharmonic from 1969 to 1975, recalled that &quot;he [Karajan] achieved most of what he wanted through charm&quot;.

But there were reasons for many of Karajan&#x27;s eccentricities. Conducting with his eyes closed, for instance, was a consequence of memorizing scores; keeping his eyes closed helped him keep focus. Karajan&#x27;s method of score study, too, was somewhat unusual, as noted by his friend Walter Legge, who remarked:

He is one of the few conductors I have known who has never made a mark in a score. He will absorb a score quietly sitting on the floor, like a relaxed Siamese cat. Over the years he has learned how completely to relax the body so the mind is absolutely free to do what it wants.

Karajan was also known for his preternaturally keen sense of tempo, even going so far as to have himself tested against a computer to prove it. He insisted that this skill was learned, not inherited, and considered it the bedrock of musical interpretations.

He cited inconsistencies in rhythmic accuracy and control as &quot;one thing that might make me lose my temper. I can accept a wrong note from an orchestra but when everything is getting faster or slower, that I cannot accept.&quot;

He once explained to a German journalist why he preferred the Berlin to the Vienna Philharmonic: &quot;If I tell the Berliners to step forward, they do it. If I tell the Viennese to step forward, they do it, but then they ask why.&quot;

=== Musical tastes ===
Karajan was a noted interpreter of virtually every standard of the classical repertoire, from the Baroque era to the 20th century. He was an admirer of Glenn Gould&#x27;s interpretations of Bach, performing the D minor Keyboard Concerto with him on one occasion. The eminent Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon considered Karajan&#x27;s recordings of the 12 London Symphonies as some of the finest he knew, and his multiple Beethoven cycles are still staples.

Yet Karajan&#x27;s real interests seem to have lain in the period from the late 19th to the mid-20th centuries. Principal among these were his fascinations with the composers Anton Bruckner and Jean Sibelius. In a 1981 interview with &quot;Gramophone&quot;″s Robert Layton, Karajan remarked that he felt &quot;a much deeper influence, affinity, kinship—call it what you like—[in Sibelius&#x27;s music] with Bruckner. There is this sense of the &quot;Urwald&quot;, the primaeval forest, the feeling of elemental power, that one is dealing with something profound.&quot; When pressed about this connection toward the end of his life by his biographer Osborne, Karajan echoed some of these sentiments, saying:

There is in both [Bruckner and Sibelius] a sense of the elemental. But I have often asked myself what it is that drew me to Sibelius&#x27;s music and I think it is that he is a composer who cannot really be compared to anyone else. ... And you come to an end with him. I think it is perhaps also to do with my love of remote places, my love of mountains rather than cities.

Layton demystifies this relationship somewhat by observing that:

[s]tring &quot;tremolandi&quot; and pedal points are, of course, among [the similarities between Bruckner and Sibelius], and we hear Brucknerian echoes in the development section of the first movement of &quot;Kullervo&quot;, written only a year or so after Sibelius first heard Bruckner&#x27;s Third Symphony in Vienna.

Yet the most potent assessment of Karajan&#x27;s interpretation of Sibelius&#x27;s music came from Sibelius himself, who, according to Legge, said, &quot;Karajan is the only conductor who plays what I meant.&quot;

Karajan was also a prolific opera conductor, championing the works of Wagner, Verdi, Richard Strauss and Puccini. Verdi&#x27;s last opera, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, was something of a mainstay throughout Karajan&#x27;s career. In his conversations with Osborne, Karajan recalled that, in the 1930s, when Italian opera was still something of a rarity in Austria and Germany:

[M]y training in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; came from Toscanini. There wasn&#x27;t a rehearsal in either Vienna or Salzburg at which I wasn&#x27;t present. I think I heard about thirty. From Toscanini I learnt the phrasing and the words—always with singers, which was unheard of in Germany then. I don&#x27;t think I ever opened the score. It was so in my ears, I just knew it.

Karajan went on to make two recordings of &quot;Falstaff&quot;—one for EMI/HMV in 1956 and another for Philips in 1980—and his colleague Otto Klemperer hailed the Vienna State Opera production as &quot;really excellent&quot;. Strauss was likewise a continual force in Karajan&#x27;s life, not just as a composer, but as a conductor. Karajan recounted their only &quot;proper&quot; meeting, in 1939, to Osborne:

[A]t the end [of a performance of &quot;Elektra&quot; in Berlin] he came and said to me it was the best performance of the opera he had ever heard. I said, &quot;I don&#x27;t really want to hear this; tell me what was wrong with it.&quot; I think he was surprised by my reaction, so he asked me to lunch the next day. He said, &quot;You have made the music very clear, the &quot;fp&quot; here, the accent there; but these are not at all important. Just wave your stick around a bit!&quot; He made a gesture like stirring a pudding. But what he meant was, let the music flow more naturally.

=== Use of recording technology ===
Karajan conducted and recorded prolifically, mainly with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonic. He conducted other orchestras (including the NHK Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris, the Orchestra of Teatro alla Scala, Milan and the Staatskapelle Dresden), but the vast majority of his recordings were made with the Berlin and Vienna orchestras. He also left a considerable legacy of recordings with the Philharmonia Orchestra, his last performance being in 1960.

Although he made recordings with several labels, notably EMI, it is Deutsche Grammophon with which he became most associated, making 330 recordings with it. Karajan&#x27;s 1981 Deutsche Grammophon recording of &quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic became the first work ever to be pressed on the compact disc format. Even though his repertoire had been extensively covered in analog (LP record), he spent the rest of the 1980s making digital recordings, notably rerecording Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies (Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s 1977 analog recording of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 won the Grand Prix du Disque, while their 1984 digital recording of it was not particularly critically acclaimed yet sold considerably more). In the mid-1990s, Deutsche Grammophon released the &quot;Karajan Gold&quot; series, remixes of Karajan&#x27;s 1980s digital recordings enhanced by 24-bit processing.

Karajan filmed performances of his work for both Unitel and his own company, Telemondial.

=== Critical reception ===
The so-called Karajan sound remains something of a litmus test for critics, dividing them into two competing camps. Two reviews from the &quot;Penguin Guide to Compact Discs&quot; illustrate this point:

* Of a 1971–72 studio recording of &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, the Penguin authors wrote, &quot;Karajan&#x27;s is a sensual performance of Wagner&#x27;s masterpiece, caressingly beautiful and with superbly refined playing from the Berlin Philharmonic&quot;.
* Of Karajan&#x27;s recording of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Paris&quot; symphonies, the same authors wrote, &quot;big-band Haydn with a vengeance ... It goes without saying that the quality of the orchestral playing is superb. However, these are heavy-handed accounts, closer to Imperial Berlin than to Paris ... the Minuets are very slow indeed ... These performances are too charmless and wanting in grace to be whole-heartedly recommended.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; writer John Rockwell wrote in 1989: &quot;He had a particular gift for Wagner and above all for Bruckner, whose music he conducted with sovereign command and elevated feeling.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Karajan&#x27;s concerts came to be considered major cultural events. In a 1982 tour of the United States, musical stars from Zubin Mehta and Seiji Ozawa to Frank Sinatra attended his Carnegie Hall concerts. Karajan was less interested in publicity or legacy than in building the cultural institution of music. &quot;When I am on the podium, I forget all about the public&quot;, he said. &quot;I am not interested in publicity. I can only hope there is an advantage to my being known in the world, that through the interest people take in me, they will then move on to an interest in music.&quot;

Much of Karajan&#x27;s legacy is inextricable from his pioneering attitude toward recording technology. He made over 800 recordings, far surpassing the output of other contemporary conductors. Deutsche Grammophon said his albums sold &quot;probably hundreds of millions&quot; of copies. The West German news weekly &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that he earned more than $6 million annually from record sales and conducting fees in 1989. Karajan amassed a fortune valued at 250 million euros as of 2008, remaining one of top-selling classical music artists two decades after his death.

=== Notable students ===
Despite Karajan&#x27;s significant prowess as a conductor, he was more often seen behind the camera than in the teaching studio, preferring to record rehearsals rather than give masterclasses. He maintained a long friendship with Ozawa, whose success makes him Karajan&#x27;s most outstanding student. Indeed, Ozawa was reportedly a strong contender to succeed Karajan at the Berlin Philharmonic; Karajan called him the &quot;conductor with the best character&quot; for the position.

Karajan and American conductor/composer Leonard Bernstein respected each other and held no animosity, but sometimes practiced a little mutual one-upmanship such that they were described as fierce rivals. Bernstein collaborated with the Berlin Philharmonic only once, in 1979 when he conducted two concerts as part of the Berliner Festspiele in which he conducted Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. It was often suggested that Bernstein could not conduct in Berlin while Karajan was alive (the Berlin Philharmonic was regarded as Karajan&#x27;s own), the truth was that Berlin Philharmonic’s managing director Wolfgang Stresemann actually invited Bernstein but as part of a subscription concert series, which Bernstein disliked. 

=== Awards and honours ===
Karajan was the recipient of multiple honours and awards. He became a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic on 17 May 1960, and in 1961 received the Austrian Medal for Science and Art. He also received the Grand Merit Cross (&quot;Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz&quot;) of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Karajan was the recipient of numerous &quot;Grand Prix du Disque&quot; awards. In 1977, Karajan was awarded the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize. On 21 June 1978 he received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University. He received the from the Académie française in Paris, the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London, the Olympia Award of the Onassis Foundation and the UNESCO International Music Prize. He received two Gramophone Awards for recordings of Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and the complete &quot;Parsifal&quot; recordings in 1981. He received the Eduard Rhein Ring of Honor from the West German Eduard Rhein Foundation, in 1984. He was voted into the inaugural Gramophone Hall of Fame in 2012. He received the Picasso Medal from UNESCO.

From 2003 to 2015, the Festspielhaus Baden-Baden awarded the annual Herbert von Karajan Music Prize in recognition of excellence in musical achievements. In 2003 Anne-Sophie Mutter, who had made her debut with Karajan in 1977, became the award&#x27;s first recipient. In 2015 the award was replaced by the Herbert von Karajan Prize, presented at the Salzburg Easter Festival.

Karajan was an honorary citizen of Salzburg (1968), West Berlin (1973) and Vienna (1978). Since 2005, his legacy has been managed by the Eliette and Herbert von Karajan Institute.

==== Grammy Awards ====
Karajan&#x27;s multiple Grammy Awards make him a particularly prominent conductor historically; he received 40 Grammy nominations across nearly 30 years. He was a three-time Grammy Award recipient, winning Best Opera Recording award for Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1964 and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot; in 1969 and Best Classical Orchestral Performance for a Beethoven symphony cycle in 1978. Karajan&#x27;s Beethoven cycles remain some of the most popular and enduring worldwide, as well as the most critically acclaimed recordings of the past century.
==== Monuments ====
Karajan has remained a visible part of everyday life in the cities he once called home, thanks in part to monuments erected in his honour. In Salzburg, for instance, the Karajan Foundation of Vienna commissioned the Czech artist Anna Chromý to create a life-sized statue of him, which now stands outside his birthplace.

In 1983, a bronze bust of Karajan was unveiled in the foyer of West Berlin&#x27;s new State Theatre.

=== In popular culture ===
Two of Karajan&#x27;s interpretations were popularized through their inclusion in the soundtrack of the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Most famously, the version of Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; heard during the film&#x27;s early outer space scenes is that of Karajan with the Berlin Philharmonic. The version of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; used in the film is that of Karajan with the Vienna Philharmonic.

=== Selected discography ===
Signing a contract with Deutsche Grammophon in 1938, Karajan was noted for his studious perfectionism in his symphonic recordings, as well as numerous opera recordings by Verdi and Puccini, in particular those with Maria Callas. Other Karajan recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic include &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;, &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, and Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 5.

During Karajan&#x27;s lifetime, the public associated him with the works of Beethoven. Karajan recorded four complete Beethoven symphony cycles, first with the Philharmonia Orchestra for Angel in 1951 to 1955, and then three times with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon in 1961–62, 1975–76, and 1982–84.

Among 20th-century musical works, Karajan had a preference for conducting and recording works from the first half of the century, by such composers as Mahler, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Bartók, Sibelius, Richard Strauss, Puccini, Honegger, Prokofiev, Debussy, Ravel, Hindemith, Nielsen, Stravinsky and Holst. Performances of works written after 1950 included Shostakovich&#x27;s Tenth Symphony (1953), which he performed many times and recorded twice. He and Shostakovich met during a tour with the Berlin Philharmonic culminating in Moscow in May 1969.
Karajan said in a 1983 interview with the West German TV channel ZDF that if he had been a composer instead of conductor, his music would have been similar to Shostakovich&#x27;s. Karajan conducted the Berlin Philharmonic in Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Sonata per Archi&quot; (1958) and &quot;Antifone&quot; (1960). In 1960 he performed Ildebrando Pizzetti&#x27;s 1958 opera &quot;Assassinio nella cattedrale&quot;. Karajan premiered Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;De temporum fine comoedia&quot; in 1973 with the Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra and recorded it for Deutsche Grammophon.

===Controversies===
In 2023 the Theater Aachen removed a bust of Karajan from the foyer of the house due to his significant involvement in the Nazi era, planning to replace it with a bust of Mozart.

<text>The observable universe is a spherical region of the universe consisting of all matter that can be observed from Earth; the electromagnetic radiation from these objects has had time to reach the Solar System and Earth since the beginning of the cosmological expansion. Assuming the universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe is a spherical region centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth.

The word &quot;observable&quot; in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect light or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the speed of light itself. No signal can travel faster than light, hence there is a maximum distance, called the particle horizon, beyond which nothing can be detected, as the signals could not have reached the observer yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the observable universe and the &quot;visible&quot; universe. The former includes signals since the end of the inflationary epoch, while the latter includes only signals emitted since recombination.

According to calculations, the current comoving distance to particles from which the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) was emitted, which represents the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion parsecs (about 45.7 billion light-years). The comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years), about 2% larger. The radius of the observable universe is therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years. Using the critical density and the diameter of the observable universe, the total mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be calculated to be about . In November 2018, astronomers reported that extragalactic background light (EBL) amounted to photons.

As the universe&#x27;s expansion is accelerating, all currently observable objects, outside the local supercluster, will eventually appear to freeze in time, while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift &quot;z&quot; from 5 to 10 will only be observable up to an age of 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about ) will never reach Earth.

== Overview ==
The universe&#x27;s size is unknown, and it may be infinite in extent. Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big Bang to have had enough time to reach Earth or space-based instruments, and therefore lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so one might expect that additional regions will become observable. Regions distant from observers (such as us) are expanding away faster than the speed of light, at rates estimated by Hubble&#x27;s law. The expansion rate appears to be accelerating, which dark energy was proposed to explain.

Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging cosmological constant) so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a &quot;future visibility limit&quot; beyond which objects will never enter the observable universe at any time in the future because light emitted by objects outside that limit could never reach the Earth. Note that, because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from Earth only slightly faster than light emits a signal that eventually reaches Earth. This future visibility limit is calculated at a comoving distance of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that can ever be theoretically observed in the infinite future is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36 (ignoring redshift effects).

In principle, more galaxies will become observable in the future; in practice, an increasing number of galaxies will become extremely redshifted due to ongoing expansion, so much so that they will seem to disappear from view and become invisible. A galaxy at a given comoving distance is defined to lie within the &quot;observable universe&quot; if we can receive signals emitted by the galaxy at any age in its history, say, a signal sent from the galaxy only 500 million years after the Big Bang. Because of the universe&#x27;s expansion, there may be some later age at which a signal sent from the same galaxy can never reach the Earth at any point in the infinite future, so, for example, we might never see what the galaxy looked like 10 billion years after the Big Bang, even though it remains at the same comoving distance less than that of the observable universe. 

This can be used to define a type of cosmic event horizon whose distance from the Earth changes over time. For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present can eventually reach the Earth if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is further away.

The space before this cosmic event horizon can be called &quot;reachable universe&quot;, that is all galaxies closer than that could be reached if we left for them today, at the speed of light; all galaxies beyond that are unreachable. Simple observation will show the future visibility limit (62 billion light-years) is exactly equal to the reachable limit (16 billion light-years) added to the current visibility limit (46 billion light-years).

== &quot;The universe&quot; versus &quot;the observable universe&quot; ==
Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term &quot;universe&quot; to mean &quot;observable universe&quot;. This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct observation about any part of the universe that is causally disconnected from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe. No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place. However, some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge.

It is plausible that the galaxies within the observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of cosmic inflation initially introduced by Alan Guth and D. Kazanas, if it is assumed that inflation began about 10−37 seconds after the Big Bang and that the pre-inflation size of the universe was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe&#x27;s size is at least light-years—at least times the radius of the observable universe.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is &quot;smaller&quot; than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different. Bielewicz et al. claim to establish a lower bound of 27.9 gigaparsecs (91 billion light-years) on the diameter of the last scattering surface. This value is based on matching-circle analysis of the WMAP 7-year data. This approach has been disputed.

== Size ==

The comoving distance from Earth to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.26 gigaparsecs (46.5 billion light-years or ) in any direction. The observable universe is thus a sphere with a diameter of about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 billion light-years or ). Assuming that space is roughly flat (in the sense of being a Euclidean space), this size corresponds to a comoving volume of about ( or ).

These are distances now (in cosmological time), not distances at the time the light was emitted. For example, the cosmic microwave background radiation that we see right now was emitted at the time of photon decoupling, estimated to have occurred about years after the Big Bang, which occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. This radiation was emitted by matter that has, in the intervening time, mostly condensed into galaxies, and those galaxies are now calculated to be about 46 billion light-years from Earth. To estimate the distance to that matter at the time the light was emitted, we may first note that according to the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric, which is used to model the expanding universe, if we receive light with a redshift of &quot;z&quot;, then the scale factor at the time the light was originally emitted is given by
formula_1.

WMAP nine-year results combined with other measurements give the redshift of photon decoupling as &quot;z&quot; = , which implies that the scale factor at the time of photon decoupling would be . So if the matter that originally emitted the oldest CMBR photons has a present distance of 46 billion light-years, then the distance would have been only about 42 million light-years at the time of decoupling.

The light-travel distance to the edge of the observable universe is the age of the universe times the speed of light, 13.8 billion light years. This is the distance that a photon emitted shortly after the Big Bang, such as one from the cosmic microwave background, has traveled to reach observers on Earth. Because spacetime is curved, corresponding to the expansion of space, this distance does not correspond to the true distance at any moment in time.

== Matter and mass ==
=== Number of galaxies and stars ===
The observable universe contains as many as an estimated 2 trillion galaxies and, overall, as many as an estimated 1024 stars – more stars (and, potentially, Earth-like planets) than all the grains of beach sand on planet Earth. Other estimates are in the hundreds of billions rather than trillions. The estimated total number of stars in an inflationary universe (observed and unobserved) is 10100.

=== Matter content—number of atoms ===
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about as discussed above, and assuming all atoms are hydrogen atoms (which are about 74% of all atoms in the Milky Way by mass), the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is obtained by dividing the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom. The result is approximately 1080 hydrogen atoms, also known as the Eddington number.

=== Mass of ordinary matter ===
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 1053 kg. In this context, mass refers to ordinary (baryonic) matter and includes the interstellar medium (ISM) and the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, it excludes dark matter and dark energy. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.

=== Estimates based on critical density ===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat. If there is no dark energy, it is also the density for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse. From the Friedmann equations, the value for formula_2 critical density, is:
: formula_3
where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant and is the present value of the Hubble constant. The value for &quot;H&quot;0, as given by the European Space Agency&#x27;s Planck Telescope, is &quot;H&quot;0 = 67.15 kilometres per second per megaparsec. This gives a critical density of , or about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic metre. This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), cold dark matter (26.8%), and dark energy (68.3%). 

Although neutrinos are Standard Model particles, they are listed separately because they are ultra-relativistic and hence behave like radiation rather than like matter. The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or . To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the &quot;observable universe&quot;. Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the comoving distance (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume (&quot;πr&quot;3) equals and the mass of ordinary matter equals density () times volume () or .

== Large-scale structure ==
Sky surveys and mappings of the various wavelength bands of electromagnetic radiation (in particular 21-cm emission) have yielded much information on the content and character of the universe&#x27;s structure. The organization of structure appears to follow a hierarchical model with organization up to the scale of superclusters and filaments. Larger than this (at scales between 30 and 200 megaparsecs), there seems to be no continued structure, a phenomenon that has been referred to as the &quot;End of Greatness&quot;. The shape of the large scale structure can be summarized by the matter power spectrum.

=== Walls, filaments, nodes, and voids ===

The organization of structure arguably begins at the stellar level, though most cosmologists rarely address astrophysics on that scale. Stars are organized into galaxies, which in turn form galaxy groups, galaxy clusters, superclusters, sheets, walls and filaments, which are separated by immense voids, creating a vast foam-like structure sometimes called the &quot;cosmic web&quot;. Prior to 1989, it was commonly assumed that virialized galaxy clusters were the largest structures in existence, and that they were distributed more or less uniformly throughout the universe in every direction. However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a large quasar group consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe.

In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex, the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the Giant Void, which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on redshift survey data, in 1989 Margaret Geller and John Huchra discovered the &quot;Great Wall&quot;, a sheet of galaxies more than 500 million light-years long and 200 million light-years wide, but only 15 million light-years thick. The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from redshifts.

Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the Clowes–Campusano LQG, a large quasar group measuring two billion light-years at its widest point, which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the Sloan Great Wall. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation Eridanus. It coincides with the &#x27;CMB cold spot&#x27;, a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.


Another large-scale structure is the SSA22 Protocluster, a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, U1.11, measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the Huge-LQG, was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time. In November 2013, astronomers discovered the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, an even bigger structure twice as large as the former. It was defined by the mapping of gamma-ray bursts.

In 2021, the American Astronomical Society announced the detection of the Giant Arc; a crescent-shaped string of galaxies that span 3.3 billion light years in length, located 9.2 billion light years from Earth in the constellation Boötes from observations captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

=== End of Greatness ===
The &quot;End of Greatness&quot; is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100 Mpc (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the universe is and isotropized in accordance with the cosmological principle. At this scale, no pseudo-random fractalness is apparent.

The superclusters and filaments seen in smaller surveys are randomized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the redshift surveys of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.

=== Observations ===


Another indicator of large-scale structure is the &#x27;Lyman-alpha forest&#x27;. This is a collection of absorption lines that appear in the spectra of light from quasars, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly hydrogen) gas. These sheets appear to collapse into filaments, which can feed galaxies as they grow where filaments either cross or are dense. An early direct evidence for this cosmic web of gas was the 2019 detection, by astronomers from the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research in Japan and Durham University in the U.K., of light from the brightest part of this web, surrounding and illuminated by a cluster of forming galaxies, acting as cosmic flashlights for intercluster medium hydrogen fluorescence via Lyman-alpha emissions.

In 2021, an international team, headed by Roland Bacon from the Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon (France), reported the first observation of diffuse extended Lyman-alpha emission from redshift 3.1 to 4.5 that traced several cosmic web filaments on scales of 2.5−4 cMpc (comoving mega-parsecs), in filamentary environments outside massive structures typical of web nodes.

Some caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because they are often different from how they appear. Gravitational lensing can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source, when foreground objects curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by general relativity) and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. Weak lensing by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure.

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if only redshift is used to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it and fall towards it, and so are blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster). On the near side, objects are redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks somewhat pinched if using redshifts to measure distance. The opposite effect is observed on galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a &quot;finger of God&quot;—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at Earth.

=== Cosmography of Earth&#x27;s cosmic neighborhood ===
At the centre of the Hydra–Centaurus Supercluster, a gravitational anomaly called the Great Attractor affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all redshifted, in accordance with Hubble&#x27;s law. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years in the direction of the Hydra and Centaurus constellations. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, astronomer R. Brent Tully of the University of Hawaii&#x27;s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex, a structure one billion light-years long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster is embedded.

== Most distant objects ==

The most distant astronomical object identified (as of August of 2024) is a galaxy classified as JADES-GS-z14-0. In 2009, a gamma ray burst, GRB 090423, was found to have a redshift of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old. The burst happened approximately 13 billion years ago, so a distance of about 13 billion light-years was widely quoted in the media, or sometimes a more precise figure of 13.035 billion light-years. 

This would be the &quot;light travel distance&quot; (see Distance measures (cosmology)) rather than the &quot;proper distance&quot; used in both Hubble&#x27;s law and in defining the size of the observable universe. Cosmologist Ned Wright argues against using this measure. The proper distance for a redshift of 8.2 would be about 9.2 Gpc, or about 30 billion light-years.

== Horizons ==

The limit of observability in the universe is set by cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which information can be obtained about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the particle horizon which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite age of the universe. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations, larger than the particle horizon owing to the expansion of space, an &quot;optical horizon&quot; at the surface of last scattering, and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for neutrinos and gravitational waves.

<text>An autoclave is a machine used to carry out industrial and scientific processes requiring elevated temperature and pressure in relation to ambient pressure and/or temperature. Autoclaves are used before surgical procedures to perform sterilization and in the chemical industry to cure coatings and vulcanize rubber and for hydrothermal synthesis. Industrial autoclaves are used in industrial applications, especially in the manufacturing of composites.

Many autoclaves are used to sterilize equipment and supplies by subjecting them to pressurized saturated steam at for 30–60 minutes at a gauge pressure of 103 kPa depending on the size of the load and the contents. The autoclave was invented by Charles Chamberland in 1879, although a precursor known as the steam digester was created by Denis Papin in 1679. The name comes from Greek &quot;auto-&quot;, ultimately meaning self, and Latin &quot;clavis&quot; meaning key, thus a self-locking device.
== Uses ==
Sterilization autoclaves are widely used in microbiology and mycology, medicine and prosthetics fabrication, tattooing and body piercing, and funerary practice. They vary in size and function depending on the media to be sterilized and are sometimes called retort in the chemical and food industries.

Typical loads include laboratory glassware, other equipment and waste, surgical instruments, and medical waste.

A notable recent and increasingly popular application of autoclaves is the pre-disposal treatment and sterilization of waste material, such as pathogenic hospital waste. Machines in this category largely operate under the same principles as conventional autoclaves in that they are able to neutralize (but not eliminate) potentially infectious agents by using pressurized steam and superheated water.

Autoclaves are also widely used to cure composites, especially for melding multiple layers without any voids that would decrease material strength, and in the vulcanization of rubber. The high heat and pressure that autoclaves generate help to ensure that the best possible physical properties are repeatable. Manufacturers of spars for sailboats have autoclaves well over long and wide, and some autoclaves in the aerospace industry are large enough to hold whole airplane fuselages made of layered composites.

A thermal effluent decontamination system functions as a single-purpose autoclave designed for the sterilization of liquid waste and effluent.

== Air removal ==
It is very important to ensure that all of the trapped air is removed from the autoclave before activation, as trapped air is a very poor medium for achieving sterility. Steam at can achieve a desired level of sterility in three minutes, while achieving the same level of sterility in hot air requires two hours at . Methods of air removal include:

;Downward displacement (or gravity-type):: As steam enters the chamber, it fills the upper areas first as it is less dense than air. This process compresses the air to the bottom, forcing it out through a drain which often contains a temperature sensor. Only when air evacuation is complete does the discharge stop. Flow is usually controlled by a steam trap or a solenoid valve, but bleed holes are sometimes used. As the steam and air mix, it is also possible to force out the mixture from locations in the chamber other than the bottom.
;Steam pulsing:: Air dilution by using a series of steam pulses, in which the chamber is alternately pressurized and then depressurized to near atmospheric pressure.
;Vacuum pumps:: A vacuum pump sucks air or air/steam mixtures from the chamber.
;Superatmospheric cycles:: Achieved with a vacuum pump. It starts with a vacuum followed by a steam pulse followed by a vacuum followed by a steam pulse. The number of pulses depends on the particular autoclave and cycle chosen.
;Subatmospheric cycles:: Similar to the superatmospheric cycles, but chamber pressure never exceeds atmospheric pressure until they pressurize up to the sterilizing temperature.

Stovetop autoclaves used in poorer or non-medical settings do not always have automatic air removal programs. The operator is required to manually perform steam pulsing at certain pressures as indicated by the gauge.

== In medicine ==
A medical autoclave is a device that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects. This means that all bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores are inactivated. However, prions, such as those associated with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and some toxins released by certain bacteria, such as Cereulide, may not be destroyed by autoclaving at the typical 134 °C for three minutes or 121 °C for 15 minutes and instead should be immersed in sodium hydroxide (1M NaOH) and heated in a gravity displacement autoclave at 121 °C for 30 min, cleaned, rinsed in water and subjected to routine sterilization. Although a wide range of archaea species, including &quot;Geogemma barossii (Strain 121)&quot;, can survive and even reproduce at temperatures found in autoclaves, their growth rate is so slow at the lower temperatures in the less extreme environments occupied by humans that it is unlikely they could compete with other organisms. None of them are known to be infectious or otherwise pose a health risk to humans; in fact, their biochemistry is so different from that of humans, and their multiplication rate is so slow, that microbiologists need not worry about them.

Autoclaves are found in many medical settings, laboratories, and other places that need to ensure the sterility of an object. Many procedures today employ single-use items rather than sterilizable, reusable items. This first happened with hypodermic needles, but today many surgical instruments (such as forceps, needle holders, and scalpel handles) are commonly single-use rather than reusable items (see waste autoclave). 

Because damp heat is used, heat-labile products (such as some plastics) cannot be sterilized this way or they will melt. Paper and other products that may be damaged by steam must also be sterilized another way. In all autoclaves, items should always be separated to allow the steam to penetrate the load evenly.

Autoclaving is often used to sterilize medical waste prior to disposal in the standard municipal solid waste stream. This application has become more common as an alternative to incineration due to environmental and health concerns about the combustion by-products emitted by incinerators, especially from the small units which were commonly operated at individual hospitals. Incineration or a similar thermal oxidation process is still generally mandated for pathological waste and other very toxic or infectious medical waste. For liquid waste, an effluent decontamination system is the equivalent hardware.

In dentistry, autoclaves provide sterilization of dental instruments.

In most of the industrialized world medical-grade autoclaves are regulated medical devices. Many medical-grade autoclaves are therefore limited to running regulator-approved cycles. Because they are optimized for continuous hospital use, they favor rectangular designs, require demanding maintenance regimens, and are costly to operate. (A properly calibrated medical-grade autoclave uses thousands of gallons of water each day, independent of task, with correspondingly high electric power consumption.)

==In research==
Autoclaves are used in education, research, biomedical research, pharmaceutical research and industrial settings to sterilize lab instruments and glassware, process waste loads prior to disposal, prepare culture media and liquid media, and artificially age materials for testing. 

Although autoclaves produced for use in medicine may be used in research settings, labs may opt for &quot;research-grade&quot; autoclaves. These are specifically designed for non-medical applications. Research autoclaves often use a “jacketless” design where steam is generated directly in the pressure chamber using heating coils (rather than relying on a “steam jacket” and independent steam generator, as is the case in high-throughput medical autoclaves). Research-grade autoclaves do not have to meet stringent requirements associated with sterilizing instruments that will be directly used on humans. Instead they can prioritize efficiency, programming flexibility, ease-of-use, and sustainability. 

In 2016, the Office of Sustainability at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) conducted a study of autoclave efficiency in their genomics and entomology research labs, tracking several units&#x27; power and water consumption. They found that, even when functioning within intended parameters, the medical-grade autoclaves used in their research labs were each consuming 700 gallons of water and 90 kWh of electricity per day (1,134MWh of electricity and 8.8 million gallons of water total), because they consumed energy and water continuously, even when not in use. UCR&#x27;s research-grade autoclaves performed the same tasks with equal effectiveness, but used 83% less energy and 97% less water.

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) completed a similar study in 2023 in order to assess the performance differences between similar-sized jacketed and non-jacketed autoclaves performing identical tasks in a research setting. They monitored side-by-side autoclaves in a facility running cycles indicative of the most common load and sterilization tasks used by their researchers campuswide. UAB found that jacketed autoclaves consumed significantly more water (44–50 gallons per cycle) and house steam (25–41 pounds per cycle) than non-jacketed autoclaves, which used less than 2 gallons of water and no house steam per cycle, regardless of cycle type or task. The higher water use by jacketed autoclaves resulted in an estimated water cost of $764 per jacketed autoclave per year, compared to $23 for non-jacketed autoclaves. With over 100 steam-jacketed autoclaves on campus, the author calculated that using jacketed autoclaves for research tasks translated into an additional $74,000 in annual excess spending for UAB. In addition, jacketed autoclaves had a higher initial purchase price than non-jacketed equivalents (37% more). The author also noted anecdotal reports of electrical utility and maintenance cost savings associated with non-jacketed autoclaves.

Research autoclaves display a wide range of designs and sizes, and are frequently tailored to their use and load type. Common variations include either a cylindrical or square pressure chamber, air- or water-cooling systems, and vertically or horizontally opening chamber doors (which may be electrically or manually powered). Research-grade autoclaves may be configured for &quot;pass-through&quot; operation. This makes it possible to maintain absolute isolation between &quot;clean&quot; and potentially contaminated work areas. Pass-through research autoclaves are especially important in BSL-3 or BSL-4 facilities.

==Quality assurance==
In order to sterilize items effectively, it is important to use optimal parameters when running an autoclave cycle. A 2017 study performed by the Johns Hopkins Hospital biocontainment unit tested the ability of pass-through autoclaves to decontaminate loads of simulated biomedical waste when run on the factory default setting. The study found that 18 of 18 (100%) mock patient loads (6 PPE, 6 linen, and 6 liquid loads) passed sterilization tests with the optimized parameters compared to only 3 of 19 (16%) mock loads that passed with use of the factory default settings.

There are physical, chemical, and biological indicators that can be used to ensure that an autoclave reaches the correct temperature for the correct amount of time. If a non-treated or improperly treated item can be confused for a treated item, then there is the risk that they will become mixed up, which, in some areas such as surgery, is critical.

Chemical indicators on medical packaging and autoclave tape change color once the correct conditions have been met, indicating that the object inside the package, or under the tape, has been appropriately processed. Autoclave tape is only a marker that steam and heat have activated the dye. The marker on the tape does not indicate complete sterility. A more difficult challenge device, named the Bowie-Dick device after its inventors, is also used to verify a full cycle. This contains a full sheet of chemical indicator placed in the center of a stack of paper. It is designed specifically to prove that the process achieved full temperature and time required for a normal minimum cycle of 134 °C for 3.5–4 minutes.

To prove sterility, biological indicators are used. Biological indicators contain spores of a heat-resistant bacterium, &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot;. If the autoclave does not reach the right temperature, the spores will germinate when incubated and their metabolism will change the color of a pH-sensitive chemical. Some physical indicators consist of an alloy designed to melt only after being subjected to a given temperature for the relevant holding time. If the alloy melts, the change will be visible.

Some computer-controlled autoclaves use an F0 (F-nought) value to control the sterilization cycle. F0 values are set for the number of minutes of sterilization equivalent to at above atmospheric pressure for 15 minutes. Since exact temperature control is difficult, the temperature is monitored, and the sterilization time adjusted accordingly.

<text>Charlestown is the oldest neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States. Also called Mishawum by the Massachusett, it is located on a peninsula north of the Charles River, across from downtown Boston, and also adjoins the Mystic River and Boston Harbor waterways. Charlestown was laid out in 1629 by engineer Thomas Graves, one of its earliest settlers, during the reign of Charles I of England. It was originally a separate town and the first capital of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

Charlestown became a city in 1848 and was annexed by Boston on January 5, 1874. With that, it also switched from Middlesex County, to which it had belonged since 1643, to Suffolk County. It has had a substantial Irish-American population since the migration of Irish people during the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s. Since the late 1980s, the neighborhood has changed dramatically because of its proximity to downtown and its colonial architecture. A mix of yuppie and upper-middle-class gentrification has influenced much of the area, as it has in many of Boston&#x27;s neighborhoods, but Charlestown still maintains a strong Irish-American population.

In the 21st century, Charlestown&#x27;s diversity has expanded dramatically, along with growing rates of the very poor and very wealthy. Today Charlestown is a largely residential neighborhood, with much housing near the waterfront, overlooking the Boston skyline. Charlestown is home to many historic sites, hospitals and organizations, with access from the Orange Line Sullivan Square or Community College stops or the I-93 expressway.

== History ==

Thomas and Jane Walford were the original English settlers of the peninsula between the Charles and the Mystic. They were given a grant by Sir Robert Gorges, with whom they had settled at Wessagusset (Weymouth) in September 1623 and arrived at what they called Mishawaum in 1624. John Endicott, first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, sent William, Richard and Ralph Sprague to Mishawaum to lay out a settlement. Thomas Walford, acting as an interpreter with the Massachusett Indians, negotiated with the local sachem Wonohaquaham for Endicott and his people to settle there. Although Walford had a virtual monopoly on the region&#x27;s available furs, he welcomed the newcomers and helped them in any way he could, unaware that his Episcopalian religious beliefs would cause him to be banished from Massachusetts to Portsmouth, New Hampshire within three years.

Originally a Puritan English city during the Colonial era, Charlestown proper was founded in 1628 and settled July 4, 1629, by Thomas Graves, Increase Nowell, Simon Hoyt, the Rev. Francis Bright, and the Spragues (Ralph, Richard, &amp; William Sprague), among some 100 others who preceded the Great Migration. John Winthrop&#x27;s company stopped here for some time in 1630, before deciding to accept the invitation of William Blaxton to settle across the Charles River with him on the Shawmut peninsula. This was the first act in the foundation of the city of Boston.
The territory of Charlestown was initially quite large. From it, Woburn was separated in 1642, Malden in 1649 (including what is now Melrose and Everett) and Stoneham in 1725. South Medford, the land south of the Mystic River (now surrounded by Somerville), was known as &quot;Mistick Field&quot; and was transferred from Charlestown to Medford in 1754. This grant also included the &quot;Charlestown Wood Lots&quot; (the Medford part of the Middlesex Fells), and part of what was at the time Woburn (now Winchester). Other parts of Medford were transferred to Charlestown in 1811. Still-rural Somerville was split off in 1842 as Charlestown was urbanizing. Everett, Burlington, Arlington and Cambridge also acquired areas originally allocated to Charlestown. Landfill operations eliminated the narrow &quot;Charlestown Neck&quot; that connected the northwest end of the &quot;Charlestown Peninsula&quot; to the mainland at Sullivan Square.

On June 17, 1775, the Charlestown Peninsula was the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill, named for a hill at the northwest end of the peninsula near Charlestown Neck. British troops unloaded at Moulton&#x27;s Point and much of the battle took place on Breed&#x27;s Hill, which overlooked the harbor from about 400 yards off the southern end of the peninsula. Charlestown, including its wharves and dockyards, was almost completely torched during the battle by British forces. The town was not appreciably rebuilt until the end of hostilities but, in 1786, the first bridge across the Charles River connected Boston with Charlestown. An Navy Yard was established in 1800; Charlestown State Prison opened in 1805. The Bunker Hill Monument was erected between 1827 and 1843 using Quincy granite brought to the site by a combination of purpose-built railway and barge. Notable businesses included the Bunker Hill Breweries (1821) and Schrafft&#x27;s candy company (1861).

The Charlestown Branch Railroad opened in 1840 to Sweet&#x27;s Wharf. Tudor Wharf was the departure point for the ships of the Tudor Ice Company.

Around the 1860s an influx of Irish immigrants arrived in Charlestown. The area long remained an Irish and Catholic stronghold similar to South Boston, Somerville, and Dorchester, to the extent that the informal demonym &quot;Townie&quot; continues to imply the working-class Irish, as opposed to newer immigrants.

During the Civil War, over 26,000 men joined the Union Army and Navy at the Navy Yard, which was also responsible for constructing some of the most famous vessels of the conflict: the &quot;Merrimack&quot;, the &quot;Hartford&quot;, and the &quot;Monadnock&quot;. Following the war, the city commissioned Martin Milmore to construct its civil war memorial, dedicated in 1872 and still standing in the community&#x27;s Training Field.

The city developed a water supply from the Mystic Lakes and, on October 7, 1873, a vote was held to determine whether Charlestown should leave Middlesex County and join Boston as part of Suffolk County. Out of its 32,040 residents, 2240 voted in support of the merger and 1947 opposed. Boston residents also approved the question, 5,960–1,868. Charlestown&#x27;s separate city government was dissolved the next year.

During the early 1960s, the city initiated plans to demolish and redevelop sixty percent of the housing in Charlestown. In 1963, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) held a town meeting to discuss their development plans with the community. The BRA&#x27;s dealings with Boston&#x27;s West End had created an atmosphere of distrust towards urban renewal in Boston, and Charlestown residents opposed the plan by an overwhelming majority. By 1965, the plan had been reduced to tearing down only eleven percent of the neighborhood, as well as the removal of the elevated rail tracks.

Throughout the 1960s until the mid-1990s, Charlestown was infamous for its Irish Mob presence. Charlestown&#x27;s McLaughlin Brothers were involved in a gang war with neighboring Somerville&#x27;s Winter Hill Gang, during the Irish Mob Wars of the 1960s. In the late 1980s, however, Charlestown underwent a massive Yuppie gentrification process similar to that of the South End. Drawn to its proximity to downtown and its colonial, red-brick, row-house housing stock, similar to that of Beacon Hill, many yuppie and upper-middle-class professionals moved to the neighborhood. In the late 1990s, additional gentrification took place, similar to that in neighboring Somerville. Today the neighborhood is a mix of yuppies, upper-middle-class and middle-class residents, housing projects, and a large working-class Irish-American demographic and culture that is still predominant.

One of the oldest neighborhoods of Boston, Charlestown is home to the Bunker Hill Monument and historic Charlestown Navy Yard. Charlestown today is a mainly residential neighborhood with an institutional presence. Major institutions include Bunker Hill Community College, Spaulding Rehabilitation Center, and a facility of Massachusetts General Hospital. Many commercial ventures line the Mystic River along Medford Street and Terminal Street. The Navy Yard, home to , is now part of the Boston National Historical Park, which marks the southern edge of the neighborhood. The waterfront has two marinas, Constitution Marina and Shipyard Quarters Marina.

== Geography ==

Charlestown is located north of downtown Boston on a peninsula extending southeastward between the Charles River and the Mystic River.

&quot;City Square&quot; in the southern part of Charlestown was the location of the city hall before annexation by Boston. It is also the terminus of the Charlestown Bridge and the former Warren Bridge, and was formerly a stop on the Charlestown Elevated. The Central Artery was built between 1951 and 1954, routing elevated ramps through City Square. The Central Artery North Area (CANA) project moved these underground, into the City Square Tunnel, making way for a revitalized surface park.

The Thompson Square is located at the confluence of Main Street, Dexter Row, Green Street, and Austin Street. Thompson Square station was formerly a stop on the Charlestown Elevated.

A small portion of Charlestown is north of the Mystic River, containing the northern approach to the Malden Bridge and now the entrance to Encore Boston Harbor (which made jurisdiction over the casino a matter of dispute). This land was formerly a peninsula, but landfill has more completely connected it to the mainland of Everett. This boundary was part of the original 1649 separation of Malden from Charlestown, where the Penny Ferry operated at the time; the first bridge opened on the site in 1787.

Two small hills mostly covered in residential buildings fill the interior of the neighborhood: Bunker Hill, which is more northerly, and Breed&#x27;s Hill, which is the site of the Bunker Hill Monument. Bunker Hill was named after George Bunker, who had owned it during early settlement in the 1600s.

== Arts and culture ==


Charlestown has many places of historical interest, some of which are included along the northern end of Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail. The Freedom Trail ends at the Bunker Hill Monument commemorating the famous Battle of Bunker Hill, an early major battle in the American Revolutionary War. Launched in 1797, the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; is the oldest commissioned vessel in the US Navy and the oldest warship in the world still afloat. Today it is docked in the Charlestown Navy Yard, today part of the National Park Service. Charlestown was also the location from which Paul Revere began his famous &quot;midnight ride&quot; before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. A restaurant opened in 1780 and still in operation, Warren Tavern, claims to have been one of Revere&#x27;s favorite taverns. Of Charlestown&#x27;s churches, St. Mary&#x27;s (1887–1893) is considered one of the masterpieces of Patrick Keely. In St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, on Devens Street, the central stained glass above the altar is a notable work of William James McPherson, a Boston designer who later designed the stained glass for the Connecticut State Capitol.

The Warren Tavern first opened in 1780. It is located at 2 Pleasant Street. The building was one of the first built after the Battle of Bunker Hill. The Tavern took its name from Joseph Warren, American Patriot who played a key role in the American Revolution and was killed in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was Warren who directed Paul Revere and William Dawes to send the message to Samuel Adams and John Hancock that the British were setting out to raid the town of Concord. Warren&#x27;s friend Captain Eliphelet Newell decided to build a tavern named after his friend. George Washington visited the tavern when he came to Massachusetts to visit his friend Benjamin Frothingham. After the Tavern was closed in 1813, the building served other purposes, and then was saved in the 1970s. The Tavern was reopened in 1972.

The Constitution Yacht Charter is located on Boston Harbor.

== Demographics ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau in its 2007–2011 report, the population of Charlestown is 16,685, comprising 7,843 males and 8,842 females. The largest age group is 25 to 29 years (14.6%), the second-largest is 30 to 34 (12.3%), and the third-largest is 35 to 39 (9.7%).

Minorities include Black or African at 1,227 (7.4%), Asian at 1,253 (7.5%), Hispanic or Latino at 1,227 (7.4%), and those of two or more races at 371 (2.2%). In recent years, the percentage of minorities living in Charlestown has increased from 4.9% of the population in 1990 to 23.5% in 2010. The population consists of 15.9% who are foreign born, 48.5% of whom are naturalized citizens, and 51.5% who are not.

The median household income is $89,017, and the median family income is $100,725. The median income for whites is $103,652; that for Blacks or African Americans, $12,143; for Hispanics or Latinos, $30,833; for Asians, $61,875; and for others, $16,876.

===== Public libraries =====
Boston Public Library operates the Charlestown Branch. The library first opened in the Warren Institution for Savings building on January 7, 1862. The library moved to a larger space in the new Charlestown City Hall in 1869. In 1913 the branch moved to the intersection of Monument Avenue and Monument Square, in proximity to the Bunker Hill Monument. The branch moved to its current location in 1970.

=== Housing policy ===

The Bunker Hill Public Housing has divided Bunker Hill Street into two Charlestowns.

<text>Briolette Kah Bic Runga (born 13 January 1976), recording as Bic Runga, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist pop artist. Her first three studio albums debuted at number one on the New Zealand Top 40 Album charts. Runga has also found success internationally in Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom with her 1997 song &quot;Sway&quot;.

==Early life==
Runga was born in Christchurch. Her mother, Sophia Tang, was a Chinese Malaysian lounge singer in Malaysia when she met Joseph Te Okoro Runga (died 2005), a Māori ex-serviceman and self-taught pianist. The couple moved to New Zealand to live. Runga is of Ngāti Kahungunu descent. Regarding her name, she explains: &quot;&#x27;You say it Bec, rather than Bic. ... It&#x27;s Chinese, it&#x27;s a strange vowel sound which doesn&#x27;t seem to translate in Australia. It means the colour of jade, which might mean green.&#x27;&quot;

Runga grew up in Hornby, Christchurch, surrounded by a musically inclined family, and started recording songs with her sisters, Boh (oldest) and Pearl, when she was four years old. Boh was the vocalist in the New Zealand rock group Stellar in the 1990s and 2000s, while Pearl is a session singer.

Runga learned how to play drums at the age of eleven, and guitar at about fourteen. She also learned to play the keyboard around this time to perform in jazz bands. She attended Cashmere High School, joining high school bands.

==Career==
===1993–1997: Early career and &quot;Drive&quot;===

Under the name Love Soup, Runga and Kelly Horgan entered the 1993 Smokefreerockquest in Christchurch, achieving third place and a music contract with Pagan Records. Using a QE II Arts Council grant, Runga recorded the first &quot;Drive&quot; EP in Wellington. Unsatisfied with the direction that her music was being taken, she moved to Auckland in 1994 and spent a year writing and performing in cafés.

In 1995, she sent a new demo of &quot;Drive&quot; to Sony Music, which signed Runga in September of that year and bought her Wellington recordings from Pagan Records. Sony had her re-record the song with more instruments, but it was eventually her demo that was used on the upcoming album. &quot;Drive&quot; is described as a &quot;haunting pop ballad&quot;, which she wrote minutes before her first Auckland performance. It entered the Top 10 in New Zealand and won her the APRA Silver Scroll award in 1996.

Runga then released &quot;Bursting Through&quot;, the first single from her upcoming album, also entitled &quot;Drive&quot;. The success of the singles led to the release of her debut album, &quot;Drive&quot;, in 1997. Runga&#x27;s song &quot;Sway&quot;, along with a duet with Dan Wilson of Semisonic called &quot;Good Morning Baby&quot;, were used in the films &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. Six singles were released from the album, while &quot;Sway&quot; was released in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

Runga has recorded two songs called &quot;Drive&quot;. The first was her own, which appeared on her debut album of the same name. The second was a 1999 collaboration with fellow New Zealanders Strawpeople, providing guest vocals for their cover of The Cars&#x27; classic 1984 hit.

===2000–2008: &quot;Beautiful Collision&quot; and &quot;Birds&quot;===
In 2000, Runga toured with Tim Finn and Dave Dobbyn, resulting in a release of a live album in November 2000, titled &quot;Together in Concert: Live&quot;. It peaked at number 2 on the New Zealand charts and has been certified 3× platinum. Runga released her second solo album, &quot;Beautiful Collision&quot; in 2002. It entered the New Zealand charts at number one and has been certified 10× platinum in New Zealand.

Her third studio album, &quot;Birds&quot;, was released in New Zealand on 28 November 2005. New Zealand artists Neil Finn (piano) and Anika Moa (backing vocals) contributed to the album. The first single, &quot;Winning Arrow&quot;, was released on the same day. It was her third consecutive studio album to enter the New Zealand charts at number one. &quot;Birds&quot; was certified triple platinum.

Runga played a &#x27;Vietnamese lounge singer&#x27; in the 2005 film &quot;Little Fish&quot;, and covered Gene Pitney&#x27;s &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot; for the soundtrack. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Runga was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to music.

In November 2008, Runga released &quot;Try to Remember Everything&quot; which is a collection of unreleased, new and rare Bic Runga recordings from 1996 to 2008. The album was certified Gold in New Zealand on 14 December 2008, selling over 7,500 copies.

===2011–2015: &quot;Belle&quot; and &quot;Anthology&quot;===

Runga contributed to the score and soundtrack to New Zealand filmmaker Roseanne Liang&#x27;s debut feature film &quot;My Wedding and Other Secrets&quot; (2011). In addition to featuring &quot;Say After Me&quot; from &quot;Birds&quot;, the film also included two tracks (&quot;Hello Hello&quot; and &quot;This Girl&#x27;s Prepared for War&quot;) from her fourth album &quot;Belle&quot;.

&quot;Belle&quot; was released in November 2011. Runga completed a 17 date tour across New Zealand and 13 dates across Ireland, United Kingdom and Australia.

A greatest hits album, &quot;Anthology&quot;, was released on 1 December 2012.

In June 2015, Runga released a new single titled &quot;Dreamed a Dream&quot;. This was a collaboration with Hollie Fullbrook of Tiny Ruins, with whom she toured New Zealand in June and July 2015. As well as solo performances by both artists, these shows included covers of songs by Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Yoko Ono, Francoise Hardy, Donovan and Fleetwood Mac.
===2016–present: &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;New Zealand Music Hall of Fame&quot;===

In October 2016, it was announced that Runga would release an album of consisting of ten covers and two original tracks titled &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;. &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; was released on 14 October 2016 as a single.

In November 2016, Runga was inducted into the New Zealand Music Hall of Fame. Recorded Music CEO Damian Vaughan said &quot;Bic is one of our most loved and treasured recording artists, her songs are instantly recognizable and have been part of the fabric of New Zealand for more than 20 years. We&#x27;re honoured to present Bic with the 2016 Legacy Award and induct her into the NZ Music Hall of Fame&quot;.

<doc id="251412" wikidata="Q1184466" url="?curid=251412" title="Workers' compensation">
<text>Workers&#x27; compensation or workers&#x27; comp is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee&#x27;s right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as &quot;the compensation bargain.” One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers.

While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.

General damage for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers&#x27; compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case.

== Origin and international comparison ==
Laws regarding workers compensation vary, but the Workers&#x27; Accident Insurance system put into place by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in 1884 with the start of Workers&#x27; Accident Laws is often cited as a model for the rest of Europe and, later, the United States. After the early Prussian experiments, the development of compensation laws around the world was in important respects the result of transnational networks among policymakers and social scientists. Thus while different countries have their own unique history of workers&#x27; compensation, compensation laws developed around the world as a global phenomenon, with each country&#x27;s deliberation on compensation laws being informed by deliberation in other countries.

=== Statutory no-fault compensation ===
Workers&#x27; compensation statutes are intended to eliminate the need for litigation and the limitations of common law remedies by having employees give up the potential for pain- and suffering-related awards in exchange for not being required to prove tort (legal fault) on the part of their employer. The laws provide employees with monetary awards to cover loss of wages directly related to the accident as well as to compensate for permanent physical impairments and medical expenses.

The laws also provide benefits for dependents of those workers who are killed in work-related accidents or illnesses. Some laws also protect employers and fellow workers by limiting the amount an injured employee can recover from an employer and by eliminating the liability of co-workers in most accidents. In the United States, state statutes establish this framework for most types of employment, while federal statutes are limited to federal employees or to workers employed in some significant aspect of interstate commerce.

The exclusive remedy provision states that workers&#x27; compensation is the sole remedy available to injured workers, thus preventing employees from also making tort liability claims against their employers.

=== Common law remedies ===
In common law nations, the system was motivated by an &quot;unholy trinity&quot; of tort defenses available to employers, including contributory negligence, assumption of risk, and the fellow servant rule.

Common law imposes obligations on employers to provide a safe workplace, provide safe tools, give warnings of dangers, provide adequate co-worker assistance (fit, trained, suitable &quot;fellow servants&quot;) so that the worker is not overburdened, and promulgate and enforce safe work rules.

Claims under the common law for worker injury are limited by three defenses afforded employers:

* The Fellow Servant Doctrine is that employer can be held harmless to the extent that injury was caused in whole or in part by a peer of the injured worker.
*Contributory negligence allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent that the injured employee failed to use adequate precautions required by ordinary prudence.
*Assumption of risk allows an employer to be held harmless to the extent the injured employee voluntarily accepted the risks associated with the work.

==By nation==

===Australia===
As Australia experienced a relatively influential labour movement in the late 19th and early 20th century, statutory compensation was implemented very early in Australia. Each territory has its own legislation and its own governing body.

A typical example is Work Safe Victoria, which manages Victoria&#x27;s workplace safety system. Its responsibilities include helping employees avoid workplace injuries occurring, enforcing Victoria&#x27;s occupational and safety laws, providing reasonably priced workplace injury insurance for employers, assisting injured workers to return to the workforce, and managing the workers&#x27; compensation scheme by ensuring the prompt delivery of appropriate services and adopting prudent financial practices.

Compensation law in New South Wales has recently (2013) been overhauled by the state government. In a push to speed up the process of claims and to reduce the amount of claims, a threshold of 11% WPI (whole person impairment) was implemented for physical injuries and 15% for psychiatric injuries

Workers&#x27; compensation regulators for each of the states and territories are as follows:
* Australian Capital Territory – Work Safe Act
* New South Wales – State Insurance Regulatory Authority (formerly WorkCover NSW)
* Northern Territory – NT Work Safe
* Queensland – The Workers&#x27; Compensation Regulator (formerly Q-COMP)
* South Australia – ReturnToWork SA (from 1 July 2015)
* Tasmania – WorkCover Tasmania
* Victoria – WorkSafe Victoria
* Western Australia – WorkCover WA

Every employer must comply with the state, territory or commonwealth legislation, as listed below, which applies to them:
* Federal legislation – Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 
*New South Wales – Workers Compensation Act 1987 and the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998
*Northern Territory – Work Health and Safety (National Uniform Legislation) Regulations
*Australian Capital Territory – Workers Compensation Act 1951
*Queensland – Workers Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003
*South Australia – Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1986
*Tasmania – Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
*Victoria – Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013 
*Western Australia – Workers Compensation and Injury Management Act 1981

===Brazil===
The National Social Insurance Institute (in Portuguese, Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social – INSS) provides insurance for those who contribute. It is a public institution that aims to recognize and grant rights to its policyholders. The amount transferred by the INSS is used to replace the income of the worker taxpayer when he or she loses the ability to work due to sickness, disability, age, death, involuntary unemployment, or even pregnancy or imprisonment. During the first 15 days, the worker&#x27;s salary is paid by the employer. After 15 days, the salary is paid by the INSS, as long as the employee is unable to work. Although the worker&#x27;s income is guaranteed by the INSS, the employer is still responsible for any loss of working capacity, temporary or permanent, when found negligent or when its economic activity involves risk of accidents or developing labour-related diseases.

===Canada===
Workers&#x27; compensation was Canada&#x27;s first social program to be introduced as it was favoured by both workers&#x27; groups and employers hoping to avoid lawsuits. The system arose after an inquiry by Ontario Chief Justice William Meredith, who outlined a system in which workers were to be compensated for workplace injuries if they gave up their right to sue their employers. It was introduced in the various provinces at different dates. Ontario and Nova Scotia were first and second in 1915, Manitoba in 1916, British Columbia in 1917, Alberta and New Brunswick in 1918, and Saskatchewan adopted the program in 1930. It remains a provincial responsibility, and thus the rules vary from province to province. In some provinces, such as in Ontario&#x27;s Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, the program also has a preventative role ensuring workplace safety. In British Columbia, the occupational health and safety mandate (including the powers to make regulation, inspect and assess administrative penalties) is legislatively assigned to the Workers&#x27; Compensation Board of British Columbia (WorkSafeBC). In most provinces, the workers&#x27; compensation board or commission remains concerned solely with insurance. The workers&#x27; compensation insurance system in every province is funded by employers based on their payroll, industry sector, and history of injuries (or lack thereof) in their workplace (usually referred to as &quot;experience rating&quot;).

===Germany===
The German worker&#x27;s compensation law of 6 July 1884, initiated by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, was passed only after three attempts and was the first of its kind in the world. Similar laws passed in Austria in 1887, Norway in 1894, and Finland in 1895.

The law paid indemnity to all private wage earners and apprentices, including those who work in the agricultural and horticultural sectors and marine industries, family helpers and students with work-related injuries, for up to 13 weeks. Workers who are totally disabled get continued benefits at 67 per cent after 13 weeks, paid by the accident funds, financed entirely by employers.

The German compensation system has been taken as a model for many nations.

=== India ===
The Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1923 was introduced on 5 March 1923. It includes employer&#x27;s liability compensation and amount of compensation and covers employees under the Workmen Compensation Act, the Fatal Accident Act and common law. Amended by The Employee’s Compensation (Amendment) Act, 2017

===Italy===
In Italy, workers&#x27; compensation insurance is mandatory and is provided by the &quot;Istituto nazionale per l&#x27;assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro&quot;.

===Japan===

Workers&#x27; accident compensation insurance is paired with unemployment insurance and referred to collectively as labour insurance. Workers&#x27; accident compensation insurance is managed by the Labor Standards Office.

===Malaysia===
The Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act, 1952 is modelled on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1906. Adopted before Malaysia&#x27;s independence from the UK, it is now used only by non-Malaysian workers, since citizens are covered by the national social security scheme.

===Mexico===
The Mexican Constitution of 1917 defined the obligation of employers to pay for illnesses or accidents related to the workplace. It also defined social security as the institution to administer the right of workers, but only in 1943 was the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) created. IMSS manages the Work Risks Insurance in a vertically integrated fashion, including registration of workers and firms, collection, classification of risks and events, and medical and rehabilitation services. A reform in 1997 defined that contributions are related to the experience of each employer. Public sector workers are covered by social security agencies with corporate and operative structures similar to those of IMSS.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, all companies that employ staff and in some cases others, must pay a levy to the Accident Compensation Corporation, a Crown entity, which administers New Zealand&#x27;s universal no-fault accidental injury scheme. The scheme provides financial compensation and support to citizens, residents, and temporary visitors who have suffered personal injuries.

===United Kingdom===
Great Britain followed the German model. Joseph Chamberlain, leader of the Liberal Unionist party and coalition with the Conservatives, designed a plan that was enacted under the Salisbury government in 1897. The Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1897 was a key domestic achievement, although it only covered certain named industries (eg railways, laundries). It served its social purpose at no cost to the government, since compensation was paid for by insurance which employers were required to take out. The system operated from 1897 to 1946. It was expanded to include industrial diseases by the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1906 and replaced by a state compensation scheme under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946. Since 1976, this state scheme has been set out in the UK&#x27;s Social Security Acts.

Work related safety issues in the UK are supervised by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who provide the framework by which employers and employees are able to comply with statutory rules and regulations.

Employer duties enforced by the HSE include protecting the health and safety of workers at workplace, risk assessment and training of workers. If an employer fails to fulfil these responsibilities, resulting in injury to an employee, then the employee has a legal right to make a workers&#x27; compensation claim against the employer and to sue their employer.

With the exception of the following, all employers are obliged to purchase compulsory Employer&#x27;s Liability Insurance in accordance with the Employer&#x27;s Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. The current minimum limit of indemnity required is £5,000,000 per occurrence. Market practice is to usually provide a minimum £10,000,000 with inner limits to £5,000,000 for certain risks, e.g. workers on oil rigs and acts of terrorism.

These employers do not require Employer&#x27;s Liability Insurance:
* local authorities (other than parish councils)
* joint boards or committees whose members include members of local authorities
* police authorities
* nationalised industries or their subsidiaries
* certain bodies which are financed out of public funds
* employers of crews on offshore installations, ships or hovercraft, if they are covered instead with a mutual insurance association of ship owners or ship owners and others
* a health service body or NHS Trust

&quot;Employees&quot; are defined as anyone who has entered into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The contract may be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, it may be written or verbal and it may be for full-time or part-time work.

These persons are not classed as employees and, therefore, are exempt:
* persons who are not employees (for example independent contractors who are not the employees of the person engaging them)
* people employed in any activity which is not a business (such as domestic servants)
* people who are related to the employer – husband, wife, father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, stepfather, stepmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, brother sister, half-brother or half-sister
* people who are not normally resident in the United Kingdom and who are working there for fewer than 14 consecutive days.

Employees need to establish that their employer has a legal liability to pay compensation. This will principally be a breach of a statutory duty or under the tort of negligence. If the employer is insolvent or no longer in existence, then compensation can be sought directly from the insurer under the terms of the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010.

For the history of worker&#x27;s compensation in the UK, see Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act 1897 and following acts.

===United States===

In the United States, some form of workers&#x27; compensation is typically compulsory for almost all employers in most states (depending upon the features of the organization), with the notable exception of Texas as of 2018. Regardless of compulsory requirements, businesses may purchase insurance voluntarily, and in the United States policies typically include Part One for compulsory coverage and Part Two for non-compulsory coverage. In many states, employers that can prove they have sufficient funds to cover their workers&#x27; compensation liabilities are allowed to engage in self-insurance, a term meaning forgoing the purchase of insurance. By 1949, every state had enacted a workers&#x27; compensation program.

In most states, workers&#x27; compensation claims are handled by administrative law judges, who often act as triers of fact.

Workers&#x27; compensation statutes which emerged in the early 1900s were struck down as unconstitutional until 1911 when Wisconsin passed a law that was not struck down; by 1920, 42 states had passed workers&#x27; compensation laws.

<text>In computer programming, an application framework consists of a software framework used by software developers to implement the standard structure of application software.

Application frameworks became popular with the rise of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), since these tended to promote a standard structure for applications. Programmers find it much simpler to create automatic GUI creation tools when using a standard framework, since this defines the underlying code structure of the application in advance. Developers usually use object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques to implement frameworks such that the unique parts of an application can simply inherit from classes extant in the framework.

== Examples ==
Apple Computer developed one of the first commercial application frameworks, MacApp (first release 1985), for the Macintosh. Originally written in an extended (object-oriented) version of Pascal termed Object Pascal, it was later rewritten in C++. Another notable framework for the Mac is Metrowerks&#x27; PowerPlant, based on Carbon. Cocoa for macOS offers a different approach to an application framework, based on the OpenStep framework developed at NeXT.

Since the 2010s, many apps have been created with the frameworks based on Google&#x27;s Chromium project. The two prominent ones are Electron and the Chromium Embedded Framework.

Free and open-source software frameworks exist as part of the Mozilla, LibreOffice, GNOME, KDE, NetBeans, and Eclipse projects.

Microsoft markets a framework for developing Windows applications in C++ called the Microsoft Foundation Class Library, and a similar framework for developing applications with Visual Basic or C#, named .NET Framework.

Several frameworks can build cross-platform applications for Linux, Macintosh, and Windows from common source code, such as Qt, wxWidgets, Juce, Fox toolkit, or Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP).

Oracle Application Development Framework (Oracle ADF) aids in producing Java-oriented systems.

Silicon Laboratories offers an embedded application framework for developing wireless applications on its series of wireless chips.

MARTHA is a proprietary software Java framework that all of the RealObjects software is built on.

<text>Three Musketeers is an abstract strategy board game by Haar Hoolim. It was published in Sid Sackson&#x27;s &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot; (2011). Like the traditional game fox and geese, it uses the principle of &quot;unequal forces&quot;; the two players neither use the same types of pieces nor the same rules, and their victory conditions are different.

==Equipment==
* Twenty-five tokens (such as checkers or poker chips), twenty-two light and three dark.
* A board marked out as a 5 by 5 grid.

==Rules==
One player takes the part of the three musketeers, the other of Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s men (&quot;the enemy&quot;). The musketeer player sets up their tokens in two opposite corners and in the center space; the enemy places tokens in all remaining board spaces:

The players take turns moving one piece, beginning with the musketeer player. The musketeer player must move a musketeer to any orthogonally (non-diagonal) adjacent space occupied by an enemy piece, removing that enemy piece from the game. Next, the enemy must move one enemy piece to any orthogonally adjacent empty space.

The enemy wins if it forces all three musketeers to the same row or column. The musketeers win if on their turn they cannot move due to a lack of adjacent enemy pieces.

<doc id="251420" wikidata="Q7894030" url="?curid=251420" title="Universal Pantheist Society">
<text>The Universal Pantheist Society is one of the world&#x27;s first official organizations dedicated to the promotion and understanding of modern pantheism. The Society does not require its members to hold to any particular creed about Pantheism and recognizes that there are a variety of beliefs that fall under the title pantheism. The Society encourages individuals in finding ways of spiritual practice in keeping with the general spirit of pantheism. Its motto is &quot;We seek renewed reverence for the Earth and a vision of Nature as the ultimate context for human existence...&quot;
==Background== 
The Universal Pantheist Society seeks to bring together Pantheists of various traditions and understandings, believing that standing together can help create a stronger community and provide greater intellectual stimulation for its participants. 

The Society, founded in 1975, was the first organization to recognize Pantheism as a religion (organized under U.S. 501(c)(3) statutes). It is a membership organization that has been serving Pantheists worldwide since 1975. The UPS social networking site welcomes all varieties of pantheists, religious naturalists, eco-humanists and other like-minded advocates.

Pantheism (Gr. pan=all, theos=God), is the title used to denote any paradigm that postulates &#x27;God is all&#x27; Pantheism identifies the Universe (Nature) with God. Various forms of pantheism have religious foundations; others have been based upon naturalistic, scientific, or poetic points of view.

== &quot;Pantheist Vision&quot; publication ==
The society is overseen by a board of directors and publishes a Journal, Pantheist Vision, which presents articles relating to the modern philosophy and practice of pantheism. Edited by Society co-founder Harold Wood, the Journal, a quarterly publication, features member-submitted articles, personal interpretations of pantheism from both members and notable figures, book reviews and essays by the editor . There are also occasionally special publications a recommended Pantheist reading list and book store.

<doc id="251423" wikidata="Q903935" url="?curid=251423" title="Breakthrough (board game)">
<text>Breakthrough is an abstract strategy board game invented by Dan Troyka in 2000 and made available as a Zillions of Games file (ZRF). It won the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition, even though the game was originally played on a 7x7 board, as it is trivially extensible to larger board sizes.

==Rules==

The board is initially set up as shown on the first diagram. To play the game on a different-sized board, just fill the two front and two back rows with pieces; the board need not be square.

Choose a player to go first; then play alternates, with each player moving one piece per turn.

A piece may move one space straight or diagonally forward if the target square is empty. In the second diagram, the white piece on c5 can move into any of the marked squares.

A piece may move into a square containing an opponent&#x27;s piece if and only if that square is one step diagonally forward. The opponent&#x27;s piece is removed and the player&#x27;s piece replaces it. For example, the black piece can capture either the white piece e2 or the one on g2; it would replace them if it chose to capture. Note that capturing is not compulsory, nor is it &quot;chained&quot; as in checkers; a player can only capture one piece in a turn.

The first player to reach the opponent&#x27;s &quot;home row&quot; — the one farthest from the player — is the winner. If all the pieces of a player are captured, that player loses. A draw is impossible because pieces can only move ahead (or be captured), and the piece closest to the opponent&#x27;s home row always has at least one forward diagonal move available.

==Strategy==

Although the rules are quite simple (and were the simplest rules in the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition), the strategy is complex and sophisticated. Generally, an effective offensive strategy is to recognize and attack &quot;pivotal&quot; pieces which are in positions to block multiple routes to victory. An effective defense is to arrange multiple blocking pieces in a blocking pattern (since a single defending piece can not effectively block a single attacking piece).

==Game Solving==

Smaller variants of the game have been solved:
* 6x5 : second player win
* 5x5 : second player win
* 3x7 : second player win

<text>Ring theory is the branch of mathematics in which rings are studied: that is, structures supporting both an addition and a multiplication operation. This is a glossary of some terms of the subject.

For the items in commutative algebra (the theory of commutative rings), see &quot;Glossary of commutative algebra&quot;. For ring-theoretic concepts in the language of modules, see also &quot;Glossary of module theory&quot;.

For specific types of algebras, see also: &quot;Glossary of field theory&quot; and &quot;Glossary of Lie groups and Lie algebras&quot;. Since, currently, there is no glossary on not-necessarily-associative algebra structures in general, this glossary includes some concepts that do not need associativity; e.g., a derivation.

<text>Watson was a software program released by Karelia Software for the Macintosh on November 27, 2001, which provided Internet content through a familiar Mac OS X-like interface through the use of plug-ins.

Plug-ins were programmed in the Objective-C language using the Cocoa frameworks included with the Mac OS X operating system.

On September 18, 2002, Apple bundled a similar program, Sherlock 3, with Mac OS X v10.2. Advocates of Watson claim that Apple copied the features of Watson without permission, compensation, or attribution. Apple, however, claims that a Watson-like program was simply the natural evolution of Sherlock 2.

At Sun Microsystems&#x27; JavaOne conference in June 2004, Sun announced that they had licensed the Watson technology and were porting it to the Java programming language under the name Project Alameda. On October 5, development of the Cocoa-based version of Watson ceased. On November 24, Dan Wood, Karelia owner and Watson lead developer, made the last version of Watson available free of charge by posting a registration code on his blog.

<text>iChat (previously iChat AV) is a discontinued instant messaging software application developed by Apple Inc. for use on its Mac OS X operating system. It supported instant text messaging over XMPP/Jingle or OSCAR (AIM) protocol, audio and video calling, and screen-sharing capabilities. It also allowed for local network discussion with users discovered through Bonjour protocols.

In OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, iChat was replaced by Messages for chat and FaceTime for video calling.

== History ==
iChat was first released in August 2002 as part of Mac OS X 10.2. It featured integration with the Address Book and Mail applications and was the first officially supported AIM client that was native to Mac OS X (the first-party AIM application at the time was still running in Classic emulation).

One episode of the first season of the HBO dramedy series &quot;Entourage&quot; had Eric Murphy having an iChat conversation with Ari Gold, marking the first time that this application was used on a television series.

== Interface ==
iChat incorporated Apple&#x27;s Aqua interface and used speech bubbles and pictures to personify the online chatting experience. With iChat, green (available), yellow (idle), and red (away) icons could be displayed next to the name of each connected user on the buddy list. For color-blind users, this could be altered to show different shapes, circle (available), triangle (idle), and squares (away), to illustrate status with shape rather than color.

=== iChat AV ===
In June 2003, Apple announced iChat AV, the second major version of iChat. It added video and audio conferencing capabilities based on the industry-standard Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The final version of the software was shipped with Mac OS X 10.3 and became available separately on the same day for Mac OS X 10.2.

=== iChat AV 2 ===
In February 2004, AOL introduced AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) version 5.5 for Windows users, which enabled video, but not audio, chats over the AIM protocol and was compatible with Apple&#x27;s iChat AV. On the same day, Apple released a public beta of iChat AV 2.1 to allow Mac OS X users to video conference with AIM 5.5 users.

=== iChat AV 3 ===
In June 2004, Steve Jobs announced that the next version of iChat AV would be included with Mac OS X 10.4. iChat AV 3 provided additional support to allow up to four people in a single video conference and ten people in an audio conference. Additionally, the new version of iChat used the H.264/AVC codec, which offered superior quality video compared to the older H.263 codec used in previous versions. This release supported the XMPP protocol, which could be directly used to connect to Google Talk and indirectly be used to connect to users of services including Facebook Chat, and Yahoo! Messenger. However, support was limited as it did not support several common XMPP features such as account creation, service discovery and full multi-user chat support. iChat 3 included the Bonjour protocol (previously called Rendezvous) which allowed iChat to automatically find other users with iChat Bonjour messaging enabled on the local network.

In October 2005, iChat received support for encrypted communications, but only for paid subscribers of .Mac (later MobileMe and currently iCloud) service. These features were part of iChat 3.1, released as part of the Mac OS X v10.4.3 update. This version also added support for XMPP multi-user chat.

In March 2007, Apple released the Mac OS X v10.4.9 update, which allowed USB video device class (UVC) cameras to be used with iChat, rather than FireWire cameras only. This allowed a wider range of cameras to be used with iChat AV.

=== iChat 4 ===
iChat 4, the first version release under iChat&#x27;s current name, was introduced as a part of Mac OS X 10.5 and received new features including: iChat Theater (inspired by ChatFX a product from Plum Amazing), Backdrops, and Screen Sharing. iChat Theater allowed users to share any file supported by Quick Look, including photos, Keynote presentations, and movies, over a video chat session. Backdrops allowed users to insert movies or photos as a backdrop in video chats. Screen Sharing allowed two users of Mac OS X Leopard to have control of the same desktop and work collaboratively. Minor features in the new release included multiple logins, animated icons, use of Photo Booth effects in live video chat, and tabbed chats.

=== iChat 5 ===
iChat 5.0, released with Mac OS X 10.6, reduced the bandwidth required for 640×480 video chats and upgraded iChat Theater to the same resolution.

=== iChat 6 ===
iChat 6.0, released with Mac OS X 10.7, added support for Yahoo Messenger account and allowed iChat users to have text, voice and video chats using their Yahoo Mail accounts. It also supported third-party plugins, eventually allowing other protocols to be compatible with the software. iChat 6 was the last iChat version; in OS X Mountain Lion, it was replaced by Messages. The final release, iChat 6.0.1, was published on February 1, 2012.

=== Messages ===
As part of the OS X Mountain Lion preview, Apple announced on February 16, 2012, that its OS X messaging client would be Messages, and that it would support the iMessage protocol, making it compatible with the iOS client. Messages also incorporates FaceTime support. Apple made Messages immediately available as a downloadable beta version for use on Mac OS X 10.7.

== Supported protocols ==
iChat&#x27;s AIM support was fully endorsed by AOL, and used their official implementation of the AIM OSCAR protocol. Using a XMPP transport, iChat could serve as a client for AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, MobileMe, ICQ and XMPP. iChat could also integrate Google Talk contacts into the XMPP pane.

<text>This list of airports in the United Kingdom is a partial list of public active aerodromes (airports and airfields) in the UK and the British Crown Dependencies. Most private airfields are not listed.

The ICAO codes for airports in the United Kingdom (and its Crown Dependencies) begin with the two letters &quot;EG&quot;. RAF Mount Pleasant on the Falkland Islands also uses the &quot;EG&quot; code.

Airport names in &quot;italics&quot; are listed in the UK Aeronautical Information Publication. Airport names in bold have scheduled commercial airline service(s). Runway information is for the longest runway when more than one is available.

<doc id="251432" wikidata="Q1591462" url="?curid=251432" title="Havannah (board game)">
<text>Havannah is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Christian Freeling. It belongs to the family of games commonly called connection games; its relatives include Hex and TwixT. Havannah has &quot;a sophisticated and varied strategy&quot; and is best played on a base-10 hexagonal board, 10 hex cells to a side.

The game was published for a period in Germany by Ravensburger, with a smaller, base-8 board suitable for beginners. It is nowadays only produced by Hexboards.

==Game rules==
One player plays as black; the other plays as white. White starts, after which moves alternate. The rules are as follows:
* Each player places one stone of their color on the board per turn.
* Stones are never moved, captured, or otherwise changed.
* A player wins when they complete one of three different structures from unbroken lines, or paths, of connected stones, all of their colour:
** A &quot;ring&quot; is a loop around one or more cells (no matter whether the encircled cells are occupied by any player or empty);
** A &quot;bridge&quot;, which connects any two of the six corner cells of the board;
** A &quot;fork&quot;, which connects any three edges of the board; corner points are not considered parts of an edge.

An example of all three winning combinations is shown above. The structure in the centre of the board is a ring; the structure on the left-hand side is a fork; the structure on the right-hand side is a bridge.

Since the first player to move in Havannah has a distinct advantage, the pie rule is generally implemented for fairness. This rule allows the second player to choose whether to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move.

Players of different strength can still play an interesting game when the weaker player (as white) is allowed to place two or more stones on the first turn.

==Difference compared to Hex==

In Hex, when the board is completely filled, exactly one player will have a winning connection; in Havannah a completely filled board will have usually more than one winning structures (but the game ends with first winning structure).

Unlike in Hex, in Havannah draws are technically possible, in practice they are extremely rare. There has been one known draw between human players.
Tactics are much easier to master than strategy, and differences in playing level are considerable.

==Computer Havannah==

In 2002 Freeling offered a prize of 1000 euros, available through 2012, for any computer program that could beat him in even one game of a ten-game match. For many years, computer programs lagged far behind human players. However, since 2010 several Havannah-playing programs have applied Monte Carlo tree search techniques resulting in some notable improvement in playing strength. The &quot;Havannah Challenge 2012&quot; was held October 15–19, 2012 during which Freeling played ten games against three of the strongest Havannah-playing programs available, playing (at least) one game as black and one as white against each opponent. Freeling lost the challenge when he had to resign a game with white against the Lajkonik program.

Until 2019, the best humans were still by far stronger than computers. However, MetaTotoro, based on Polygames (an open-source project, initially developed by Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research and several universities), won four times in a row on the board of size 8 against the human player with the best ELO rank on LittleGolem, who was also the winner of various tournaments.
This result was achieved by the same program as the one used for beating best humans at Hex. It is a zero-learning based algorithm, as in AlphaZero, but with novelties: boardsize invariance thanks to fully convolutional neural networks (as in U-Net) and global pooling. This allows growing architectures, meaning the program can learn on a small board, and then extrapolate on a large board.

Havannah is a recurring game at the Computer Olympiad. It is played on a base-8 board and sometimes also on a base-10 board. During this competition the pie rule is used.

== Computational complexity ==

Solving Havannah is PSPACE-complete with respect to the size of the input graph. The proof is by a reduction from generalized geography and is based on using ring-threats to represent the geography graph.
In detail, since Lichtenstein and Sipser have proved that generalized geography remained PSPACE-hard even if the graph is only bipartite and of degree at most 3, it only remains to construct an equivalent Havannah position from such a graph, which is accomplished by constructing various gadgets in Havannah.

<doc id="251434" wikidata="Q3932109" url="?curid=251434" title="Pie rule">
<text>The pie rule, sometimes referred to as the swap rule, is a rule used to balance abstract strategy games where a first-move advantage has been demonstrated. After the first move is made in a game that uses the pie rule, the second player must select one of two options:
# &quot;Letting the move stand.&quot; The second player remains the second player and moves immediately.
# &quot;Switching places.&quot; The second player becomes the first-moving player with the move already done by the opponent, and the opponent plays the first move of their new color.

Depending on the game, there may be two ways to implement switching places.
# &quot;Switching colors&quot; means that the players exchange pieces. The player who made the first move becomes the second player and makes the second move on the board. This is demonstrated in the chess diagrams shown here.
# &quot;Switching the first piece&quot; can occur in games where the board starts empty and the first move consists of placing one piece. Suppose the colors are white versus black, and black places the first piece. This piece is replaced by a white piece &quot;in the corresponding location for white&quot;, and the black piece is returned to black&#x27;s supply. In a game such as Hex or TwixT, the corresponding location is at a cell &quot;reflected&quot; across the nearest (or either) diagonal. In games such as Y, where the board is not directional, the white stone replaces the black stone in the same cell. Players keep their respective color pieces, and play continues with black making the next move. This is effectively the same as switching colors.

The use of pie rule was first reported in 1909 for a game in the Mancala family. Among modern games, Hex uses this rule. TwixT in tournament play uses a swap rule. In Meridians, the first player places 2 stones on the board before the second player chooses the color. The rule can be applied to other games which are otherwise solved for one player, such as Gomoku or Tablut.

The rule gets its name from the divide and choose method of ensuring fairness in when dividing a pie between two people: one person cuts the pie in half, then the other person chooses which half to eat. The person cutting the pie, knowing that the other person will choose the larger piece, will make as equal a division as possible.

This rule acts as a normalization factor in games where there may be a first-move advantage. In games that cannot end in a draw, such as Hex, the pie rule theoretically gives the second player a win (since one of the players must have a winning strategy after the first move, and the second player can choose to be this player), but the practical result is that the first player will choose a move neither too strong nor too weak, and the second player will have to decide whether switching places is worth the first-move advantage.

==Use for determining komi in Go==
In Go, one player can choose the amount of komi. (These are the points given to the second player as compensation for not going first.) The other player then decides whether to accept that or switch colors with the other player. This leads players to choose fair komi amounts because if they choose a komi that is too advantageous, the other player can just choose to play White and take advantage of that high komi.

<text>Eochu Airem (&quot;the ploughman&quot;), son of Finn, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne after the death of his brother, Eochu Feidlech, and ruled for twelve or fifteen years, until he was burned to death in Fremain by Sigmall Sithienta. He was succeeded by Eterscél. The &quot;Lebor Gabála&quot; synchronises his reign with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar (48–44 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates his reign to 82–70 BC, that of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 131–116 BC.

He plays an important role in the Old Irish saga &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Étaín&quot;), which tells of the lives of the beautiful Étaín, the lover of Midir of the Tuatha Dé Danann, who was turned into a fly by Midir&#x27;s jealous wife, which had been swallowed by the wife of Étar, an Ulster warrior. Étar&#x27;s wife becomes pregnant, and Étaín is reborn. When Eochu invites the men of Ireland to the festival of Tara, they refuse to attend for a king who has no queen. He sends messengers to look for the most beautiful woman in Ireland, and they find Étaín. Eochu falls in love with her at first sight, and marries her.

However, Eochu&#x27;s brother, Ailill Angubae, also falls in love with her, and wastes away with unrequited desire. Eochu leaves Tara on a tour of Ireland, leaving Étaín with the dying Ailill, who tells her the cause of his sickness, which he says would be cured if she gave the word. She tells him she wants him to be well, and he begins to get better, but says the cure will only be complete if she agrees to meet him on the hill above the house, so as not to shame the king in his own house. She agrees to do so three times, but each time she goes to meet him, she in fact meets Midir, who has put Ailill to sleep and taken his appearance. On the third occasion Midir reveals his identity and tells Étaín who she really is, but she does not know him. She finally agrees to go with him, but only if Eochu agrees to let her go.

Later, after Ailill has fully recovered and Eochu has returned home, Midir comes to Tara and challenges Eochu to play &quot;fidchell&quot;, an ancient Irish board game, with him. They play for ever increasing stakes. Eochu keeps winning, and Midir has to pay up. One such game compels Midir to build a causeway across the bog of Móin Lámrige: the Corlea Trackway, a wooden causeway built across a bog in County Longford, dated by dendrochronology to 148 BC, is a real-life counterpart to this legendary road. Finally, Midir suggests they play for a kiss and an embrace from Étaín, and this time he wins. Eochu tells Midir to come back in a month for his winnings, and gathers his best warriors at Tara to prepare for his return. Despite the heavy guard, Midir appears inside the house. Eochu agrees that Midir may embrace Étaín, but when he does, the pair fly away through the skylight, turning into swans as they do so.

Eochu instructs his men to dig up every &quot;síd&quot; (fairy-mound) in Ireland until his wife is returned to him. Finally, when they set to digging at Midir&#x27;s &quot;síd&quot; at Brí Léith, Midir appears and promises to give Étaín back. But at the appointed time, Midir brings fifty women, who all look alike, and tells Eochu to pick which one is Étaín. He chooses the woman he thinks is his wife, takes her home and sleeps with her. She becomes pregnant and bears him a daughter. Later, Midir appears and tells him that Étaín had been pregnant when he took her, and the woman Eochu had chosen was his own daughter, who had been born in Midir&#x27;s &quot;síd&quot;. Out of shame, Eochu, orders the daughter of their incestuous union to be exposed, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman and his wife, and later marries Eochu&#x27;s successor Eterscél and becomes the mother of the High King Conaire Mór (in &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; she is named as Mess Búachalla and is the daughter of Étaín and Eochu Feidlech).

<text>Road running is the sport of running on a measured course over an established road. This differs from track and field on a regular track and cross country running over natural terrain.

These events are usually classified as long-distance according to athletics terminology, with races typically ranging from 5 kilometers to 42.2 kilometers in the marathon. They may involve large numbers of runners or wheelchair recognizedSince the late 2010, many road running events also offer Nordic Walking as a separate competition along the same route. The four most common World Athletics recognized distances for road running events are 5K runs, 10K runs, half marathons and marathons.

Running on the road is an alternative surface to running on a trail, track, or treadmill. For many people looking to participate in running as an activity or sport, there are multiple opportunities that can be found on the road.

Road running is one of several forms of road racing, which also includes road bicycle racing and motor vehicle road racing.

==Courses==
Race courses are usually held on the streets of major cities and towns but can be on any road. World Athletics recognizes eleven common distances for road races that are eligible to be counted for records if they meet the eligibility criteria: , , , , , , half marathon (21.098 km or 13.1 mi), , , , marathon (42.195 km or 26.2 mi), , and . The 24-hour run is also recognized. Of these, the 5K, 10K, 25K, 30K, half marathon, marathon, and 100K are distances that are recognized for world records.

Some major events have unique distances. The Fifth Avenue Mile in New York City, United States is ; the &quot;Round the Bays&quot; run in Auckland, New Zealand is ; the Falmouth Road Race in Falmouth, Massachusetts is ; the Manchester Road Race in Manchester, Connecticut is ; &quot;City to Surf&quot; in Sydney, Australia is ; Honolulu&#x27;s &quot;Great Aloha Run&quot; is ; the &quot;King Island Imperial 20&quot; is long; and the &quot;Charleston Distance Run&quot; in Charleston, West Virginia is .

==Participation==
Most road running events are open to the general public. Participants are of varying running ability. It is not unusual for large events to have thousands of participants. Men and women compete side by side, and professional runners run in the same events as the average runner. In more prestigious races this is less likely to happen as there will be separate heats for men and women and for professional and non-professional athletes. In certain athletic events, first time amateurs are welcome to participate in the same event as members of running clubs and even current world-class champions.

This wide availability makes road racing extremely popular, and millions of people worldwide run thousands of races each year. In the U.S., 18.1 million people registered for recreational road races in 2018. While world record-holders can maintain paces of 4–5 minutes per mile (2.5 – 3 minutes per km), non-professional runners average around 10 min/mile (6 min/km). The majority of registrants run for personal reasons such as achievement and fitness rather than to compete, and many race courses accommodate this by staying open long enough for participants to jog or walk the distance.

=== Timing ===
In order to record times for participants in road races, the race organiser typically pays a timing company to take times electronically, using a technology called radio-frequency identification (RFID). RFID technology is placed in either a disposable race bib, a shoe chip that is tied to shoelaces, or an ankle bracelet. RFID timing mats are then placed at the finish line of the race; when the runner crosses the line their time will be automatically recorded. This technology has developed over time to be the most efficient form of recording multiple athlete times.

== Benefits ==

=== Diversity ===
Road running is recognizable for its diverse features. Anyone is welcome to participate in road running whether it be for recreational activity or for the purpose of competition. Running is an activity that attracts people from all over the world and for any age. For example, many road racing events recognize finishers in an age group system which acts as a way to reward younger or older athletes who may not be able to compete with runners in a prime age.

=== Charity ===
Road races are often community-wide events that highlight or raise money for an issue or project. In the US, Susan G. Komen&#x27;s Race for the Cure is held nationwide to raise breast cancer awareness. This race is also run in Germany, Italy and Puerto Rico. Similarly, Race for Life holds races throughout the UK to raise money for Cancer Research UK. First person &quot;race reports&quot; frequently appear on the Dead Runners Society electronic mailing list. Dublin, Ireland&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Mini-Marathon is said to be the largest all-female event of its kind in the world.

=== Motivation to be active ===
For many, competing in a local road race can be the motivation needed for individuals to pursue physical activity. In a study done by the bureau for labor statistics, road running ranked third in the most common form of sport and exercise activity for Americans.

=== Physical benefit ===
Running on the roads has a different effect on the muscles in the human body opposed to running on the treadmill. Treadmills are made to assist running form due to the way the belt pushes your legs back enhancing movement. Running on the road through various conditions such as hills will do more to strengthen glutes, hamstrings, quads, and smaller muscles in the legs. Additionally, running on the road can help improve bone density as your body breaks down from impact and then regenerates itself.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Impact ===
As with any type of running, there is a risk of natural wear and tear on the human body due to the different movements required to run. The difference with road running compared to other forms is that for long periods of time, a runner will continuously be landing on a harder surface, which can lead to various overuse injuries. In any given year, on average 65–80 percent of runners experience some type of injury. In order to decrease the risk of becoming injured from impact on the road, runners can change their shoes every 300–400 miles (500–650 km). This is important because high mileage shoes have poor shock absorption and worn down treads which can cause pain.

=== Danger ===
One danger in road running, as opposed to running in any other location, is that vehicles drive by regularly at high speeds. In a study by the company Road ID, it was found that on average 122,000 runners are hit by vehicles and end up in hospital each year. This figure does not include runners who are hit but do not end up in hospital. Runners can take precautions to decrease this risk, including: wearing reflective gear, wearing bright colors, running only during daylight, wearing a headlight, and running on the side of the road opposite traffic.

=== Costs ===
Although running can seem like a very cheap activity that anyone can partake in, there are some expenses. Replacing running shoes every 400–500 miles (650–800 km) costs money. Also, road race entry fees can be expensive because they have to cover the costs incurred by the race organizer. The entry fee for some big city marathons can be 150 to 300 dollars.

== Governing body and international organizations ==
The international governing body for road racing is World Athletics (formerly IAAF). World Athletics aims to set the standards for competitions by ensuring that all participants are drug-free and that all equipment used is legal. World Athletics measures each race course to give it an World Athletics certification rating. Once a race course is certified, the course can be counted for different records or rankings.

National governing bodies which are affiliated to World Athletics are responsible for road races held in their country. Of the thousands of road races held each year, 238 races, including some premier ones, are members of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races (AIMS). Many race organizers (or the running clubs which conduct the races) are members of the Road Runners Club of America. In addition, the USA Track &amp; Field plays a role in selecting representatives for certain international competitions under the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.

Competitors from around the world participate in what are dubbed the &quot;elite&quot; races for cash prizes. Elite level road running series include the World Marathon Majors, the Great Run series, and IAAF Road Race Label Events.

<doc id="251443" wikidata="Q83975" url="?curid=251443" title="Asherah">
<text>Asherah (; ; ; ; Qatabanian: &#x27;) was a goddess in [[ancient Semitic religion]]s. She also appears in [[Hittites|Hittite]] writings as &quot;Ašerdu(š)&quot; or &quot;Ašertu(š)&quot; (), and asAthirat in Ugarit. The majority of scholars hold that Yahweh and Asherah were a consort pair in ancient Israel and Judah, while others disagree.

== Name ==

=== Etymology ===
Some have sought a common-noun meaning of her name, especially in Ugaritic appellation &quot;rabat athirat yam&quot;, only found in the Baal Cycle. But a homophone&#x27;s meaning to an Ugaritian doesn&#x27;t equate an etymon, especially if the name is older than the Ugaritic language. There is no hypothesis for &quot;rabat athirat yam&quot; without significant issues, and if Asherah were a word from Ugarit it would be pronounced differently.

The common NW Semitic meaning of &quot;šr&quot; is &quot;king, prince, ruler.&quot; The NW Semitic root &quot;ʾṯr&quot; (Arabic ) means &quot;tread&quot;.

=== Grammar ===

The -ot ending &quot;Asherot&quot; is found three times in the Tanakh, with -im &quot;Asherim&quot; making up the great majority. The significance is unclear, as the interaction of gender and number in Hebrew is not robustly understood. Not all scholars find HB references with final t plural. Archaic suffixes like –atu/a/i became Northwest Semitic -at or -ā latter written -ah in transcription. That is, merely terminally alternate spellings like Asherat and Asherah reflect contextual rather than existential variation.

Her name is sometimes &quot;’lt&quot; &quot;Elat&quot;, the feminine equivalent of El. Her titles often include &quot;qdš&quot; &quot;holy&quot; and &quot;baʽlat&quot;, or &quot;rbt&quot; &quot;lady&quot;, and &quot;qnyt ỉlm&quot;, &quot;progenitress of the gods.&quot;

== Interpretation ==
Asherah was an important Goddess recognized across Northwest Semitic cultures. However, particularly in the Hebrew Bible, the term &quot;asherah&quot; and sometimes &quot;asherot,&quot; came to be identified with cultic wooden objects, sometimes referred to as &quot;asherah&quot; poles. In this context, in regard to certain attestations of Asherah, there is controversy about whether the inscriptions referring to Asherah indicate the deity, a &quot;cultic object&quot;, or both (de Vaux). Winter says the goddess and her symbol should not be distinguished.

Beside the obvious connections between goddesses who sometimes cannot be distinguished , some scholars have found an early link between Asherah and Eve, based upon the coincidence of their common title as &quot;the mother of all living&quot; in Genesis 3:20 through the identification with the Hurrian mother goddess, Hebat. Olyan notes that Eve&#x27;s original Hebrew name, &quot;ḥawwāh&quot;, is cognate to &quot;ḥawwat&quot;, an attested epithet of Tanit in the first millennium BCE, though other scholars dispute a connection between Tanit and Asherah, and between Asherah and Eve. A Phoenician deity Ḥawwat is attested in the Punica tabella defixionis.

There is further speculation that the Shekhinah as a feminine aspect of Yahweh may be a cultural memory or devolution of Asherah. Another such aspect is seen in the feminine (grammatically or otherwise) treatment of the Holy Spirit or Sophia. Goddess &quot;aspect creep&quot; can even lap upon male figures like Jacob or Jesus.

== Iconography ==

A variety of symbols have been associated with Asherah. The most common by far is that of the tree, an equivalence seen as early as Neolithic times.

Cultic objects dedicated to Asherah frequently depict trees, and the terms &quot;asherim&quot; and &quot;asheroth&quot;, regularly invoked by the Hebrew Bible in the context of Asherah worship, are traditionally understood to refer to sacred trees called &quot;Asherah poles&quot;. An especially common Asherah tree in visual art is the date palm, a reliable producer of nutrition through the year. Some expect living trees, but Olyan sees a stylized, non-living palm or pole. The remains of a juniper tree discovered in a 7,500 year old gravesite in Eilat has been considered an Asherah tree by some.

Asherah&#x27;s association with fertility was not limited to her association with trees; she was often depicted with pronounced sexual features. Idols of Asherah, often called ’Astarte figurines’, are representative of Asherah as a tree in that they have bodies which resemble tree trunks, while also further extenuating the goddess&#x27; connection to fertility in line with her status as a &quot;mother goddess&quot;. The &quot;Judean pillar figures&quot; universally depict Asherah with protruding breasts. Likewise, the so-called Revadim Asherah is rife with potent, striking sexual imagery, depicting Asherah suckling two smaller figures and using both of her hands to fully expose her vagina. Many times, Asherah&#x27;s pubis area was marked by a concentration of dots, indicating pubic hair, though this figure is sometimes polysemically understood as a grape cluster. The womb was also sometimes used as a &quot;&quot; symbol, as animals are often shown feeding directly (if a bit abstractly) from the pubic triangle.

Remarking on the Lachish ewer, Hestrin noted that in a group of other pottery vessels found &quot;in situ&quot;, the usual depiction of the sacred tree flanked by ibexes or birds is in one goblet replaced by a pubic triangle flanked by ibexes. The interchange between the tree and the pubic triangle prove, according to Hestrin, that the tree symbolizes the fertility goddess Asherah. Hestrin draws parallels between this and representations of Hathor as the sycamore tree goddess in Egypt, and suggests that during the period of Egyptian rule in Palestine the Hathor cult penetrated the region so extensively that Hathor became identified with Asherah. Other motifs in the ewer such as a lion, fallow deer and ibexes seem to have a close relationship with the iconography associated with her.

Asherah may also have been associated with the ancient pan-Near Eastern &quot;Master of animals&quot; motif, which depicted a person or deity betwixt two confronted animals. According to Beaulieu, depictions of a divine &quot;mistress of lions&quot; motif are &quot;almost undoubtedly depictions of the goddess Asherah.&quot;
The lioness made a ubiquitous symbol for goddesses of the ancient Middle East that was similar to the dove and the tree. Lionesses figure prominently in Asherah&#x27;s iconography, including the tenth-century BC Ta&#x27;anach cult stand, which also includes the tree motif. A Hebrew arrowhead from the eleventh century BC bears the inscription &quot;Servant of the Lion Lady&quot;.

The symbols around Asherah are so many (8+ pointed star, caprids and the like, along with lunisolar, arboreal, florid, serpentine) that a listing would approach meaninglessness as it neared exhaustiveness. Frevel&#x27;s 1000-page dissertation ends enigmatically with the pronouncement &quot;There is no genuine Asherah iconography&quot;.

== By region ==

=== Sumer ===
An Amorite goddess named &quot;Ashratum&quot; is known to have been worshipped in Sumer. Her Amorite provenance is further supported by her status as the wife of Mardu/Amurrum, the supreme deity of the Amorites.

A limestone slab inscribed with a dedication made by Hammurabi to Ashratum is known from Sippar. In it, he complements her as &quot;lord of the mountain&quot; (&quot;bel shadī&quot;), and presages similar use with words like &quot;voluptuousness, joy, tender, patient, mercy&quot; to commemorate setting up a &quot;protective genius&quot; (font?) for her in her temple.

Though it is accepted that Ashratum&#x27;s name is cognate to that of Asherah, the two goddesses are not actually identified with one another, given that they occupied different positions within their pantheons, despite sharing their status as consort to the supreme deity.

=== Akkad ===
In Akkadian texts, Asherah appears as &quot;Aširatu&quot;; though her exact role in the pantheon is unclear; as a separate goddess, &quot;Antu&quot;, was considered the wife of Anu, the god of Heaven. In contrast, ʿAshtart is believed to be linked to the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar who is sometimes portrayed as the daughter of Anu.

Points of reference in Akkadian epigraphy are collocated and heterographic Amarna Letters 60 and 61&#x27;s Asheratic personal name. Within them is found a king of the Amorites by the 14th-century name of Abdi-Ashirta, &quot;servant of Asherah&quot;.

Each is on line ii within the letter&#x27;s opening or greeting sentiment. Some may transcribe &quot;Aširatu&quot; or &quot;Ašratu&quot;.

=== Ugarit ===
In Ugaritic texts, Asherah appears as ʾṯrt (Ugaritic: 𐎀𐎘𐎗𐎚), anglicised &quot;ʾAṯirat&quot; or &quot;Athirat&quot;. She is called &quot;ʾElat&quot;, &quot;goddess&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;ʾEl&quot; (compare &quot;Allāt&quot;); she is also called &quot;Qodeš&quot;, &quot;holiness&quot;. There is reference to a &quot;šr. ‘ṯtrt.&quot; Gibson says sources from before 1200 BC almost always credit Athirat with her full title &quot;rbt ʾṯrt ym&quot; (or &quot;rbt ʾṯrt&quot;). However, Rahmouni&#x27;s indexing of Ugaritic epithets states the phrase occurs in only the Baʿal Epic. Apparently of Akkadian origin, &quot;rabat&quot; means &quot;lady&quot; (literally &quot;female great one&quot;). She appears to champion her son, Yam, god of the sea, in his struggle against Baʾal. (Yam&#x27;s ascription as &quot;god of&quot; the sea may mislead; Yam is the deified sea itself rather than a deity who holds dominion over it.) So some say Athirat&#x27;s title can be translated as &quot;Lady ʾAṯirat of the Sea&quot;, alternatively, &quot;she who walks on the sea&quot;, or even &quot;the Great Lady-who-tramples-Yam.&quot; This invites relation to a Chaoskampf in which neither she nor Yam is otherwise implicated. Park suggested in 2010 that the name Athirat might be derived from a passive participle form, referring to the &quot;one followed by (the gods)&quot;, that is, &quot;progenitress or originatress&quot;, which would correspond to Asherah&#x27;s image as the &quot;mother of the gods&quot; in Ugaritic literature. This solution was a response to and variation of B. Margalit&#x27;s of her following in Yahweh&#x27;s literal footsteps, a less generous estimation nonetheless supported by D&#x27;s use of the Ugaritian word in an ordinary sense. Binger finds some of these risibly imaginative, and unhappily falls back on the still-problematic interpretation that Ym may also mean day, so &quot;Lady Asherah of the day&quot;, or, more simply, &quot;Lady Day&quot;. The common Semitic root &quot;ywm&quot; (for reconstructed Proto-Semitic *&quot;yawm-&quot;), from which derives (), meaning &quot;day&quot;, appears in several instances in the Masoretic Texts with the second-root letter (&quot;-w-&quot;) having been dropped, and in a select few cases, replaced with an A-class vowel of the Niqqud, resulting in the word becoming &quot;y(a)m&quot;. Such occurrences, as well as the fact that the plural, &quot;days&quot;, can be read as both &quot;yōmîm&quot; and &quot;yāmîm&quot; (), gives credence to this alternate translation.

Another primary epithet of Athirat was &quot;qnyt ʾilm&quot;, which may be translated as &quot;the creator of the deities&quot;. In those texts, Athirat is the consort of the god ʾEl; there is one reference to the 70 sons of Athirat, presumably the same as the 70 sons of ʾEl.

Among the Hittites this goddess appears as &quot;Ašertu(š)&quot; or &quot;Ašerdu(š)&quot; in the myth of Elkunirša (&quot;El, the Creator of Earth&quot;) her husband, in which she tried to sleep with the storm god.

=== In Israel and Judah ===
The conception of Asherah as the partner of Yahweh has stirred a lot of debate. While the consensus view is that Asherah is separate from Yahwism, most scholars have argued that Yahweh and Asherah were a consort pair according to some religions in the region.

==== Inscriptions ====

Possible evidence for her worship includes an iconography and inscriptions at two locations in use circa the 9th century. The first was in a cave at Khirbet el-Qom.

The second was at Kuntillet Ajrud. In the latter, a jar shows bovid-anthropomorphic figures and several inscriptions that refer to &quot;Yahweh of Samaria and his Asherah&quot; and &quot;Yahweh of Teman and his Asherah.&quot; However, a number of scholars hold that the &quot;asherah&quot; mentioned in the inscriptions refers to some kind of cultic object or symbol, rather than a goddess. For instance, some scholars have argued that since cognate forms of &quot;asherah&quot; are used with the meaning of &quot;sanctuary&quot; in Phoenician and Aramaic inscriptions from the same period, this may also be the meaning of the term in the two Hebrew inscriptions. Others argue that the term &quot;asherah&quot; may refer to a sacred tree or grove used for the worship of Yahweh as this is the meaning that the Hebrew term has in the Hebrew Bible and in the Mishnah.

In one potsherd there appear a large and small bovine. This &quot;oral fixation&quot; motif has diverse examples, see figs 413–419 in Winter. In fact, already Flinders Petrie in the 1930s was referring to Davies on the memorable stereotype. It&#x27;s such a common motif in Syrian and Phoenician ivories that the Arslan Tash horde had at least four; they can be seen in the Louvre.

==== Sacred prostitution ====
Early scholarship emphasized somewhat mutually-negating possibilities of holy prostitution, &quot;hieros gamos&quot;, and orgiastic rites.
It has been suggested by several scholars that there is a relationship between the position of the &quot;gəḇīrā&quot; in the royal court and the worship (orthodox or not) of Asherah.
The Hebrew Bible frequently and graphically associates goddess worship with prostitution (&quot;whoredom&quot;) in material written after the reforms of Josiah. Jeremiah, and Ezekiel blame the goddess religion for making Yahweh &quot;jealous&quot;, and cite his jealousy as the reason Yahweh allowed the destruction of Jerusalem. Although their nature remains uncertain, sexual rites typically revolved around women of power and influence, such as Maacah. The Hebrew term &quot;qadishtu&quot;, formerly translated as &quot;temple prostitutes&quot; or &quot;shrine prostitutes&quot;, literally means &quot;priestesses&quot; or &quot;consecrated women&quot;, from the Semitic root &quot;qdš&quot;, meaning &quot;holy&quot;. However, there is a shrinking scholarly consensus that sacred prostitution existed, and some argue that sex acts within the temple were limited to yearly sacred fertility rites aimed at assuring an abundant harvest.

==== In the Hebrew Bible ====

There are references to the worship of numerous deities throughout the Books of Kings: Solomon builds temples to many deities and Josiah is reported as cutting down the statues of Asherah in the temple Solomon built for Yahweh (2 Kings 23:14). Josiah&#x27;s grandfather Manasseh had erected one such statue (2 Kings 21:7).

The name Asherah appears forty times in the Hebrew Bible, but it is much reduced in English translations. The word &quot;ʾăšērâ&quot; is translated in Greek as (grove; plural: ἄλση) in every instance apart from Isaiah 17:8; 27:9 and 2 Chronicles 15:16; 24:18, with (trees) being used for the former, and, peculiarly, Ἀστάρτη (Astarte) for the latter. The Vulgate in Latin provided &quot;lucus&quot; or &quot;nemus&quot;, a grove or a wood. From the Vulgate, the King James translation of the Bible uses &quot;grove&quot; or &quot;groves&quot; instead of Asherah&#x27;s name. Non-scholarly English language readers of the Bible would not have read her name for more than 400 years afterward. The association of Asherah with trees in the Hebrew Bible is very strong. For example, she is found under trees (1 Kings 14:23; 2 Kings 17:10) and is made of wood by human beings (1 Kings 14:15, 2 Kings 16:3–4). The farther from the time of Josiah&#x27;s reforms, the broader the perception of an Asherah became. Trees described in later Jewish texts as being an asherah or part of an asherah include grapevines, pomegranates, walnuts, myrtles, and willows. Eventually, monotheistic leaders would suppress the tree due to its association with Asherah.

Deuteronomy 12 has Yahweh commanding the destruction of her shrines so as to maintain purity of his worship. Jezebel brought hundreds of prophets for Baal and Asherah with her into the Israelite court.

William Dever&#x27;s book discusses female pillar figurines, the queen of heaven name, and the cakes. Dever also points to the temple at Tel Arad, the famous archaeological site with cannabinoids and massebot. Dever notes: &quot;The only goddess whose name is well attested in the Hebrew Bible (or in ancient Israel generally) is Asherah.&quot;

=== Philistine records ===
Various partial inscriptions found on destroyed seventh century BCE jars in Ekron contain words like &quot;šmn&quot; &quot;oil&quot;, &quot;dbl&quot; &quot;fig cake&quot;, &quot;qdš&quot; &quot;holy,&quot; &quot;l&#x27;šrt&quot; &quot;to Asherah&quot;, and &quot;lmqm&quot; &quot;for the shrine&quot;. This has been taken as evidence that Asherah was worshipped in Philistia.

=== In Egyptian sources ===
Attempts to identify Asherah within the pantheon of ancient Egypt have been met with both limited acceptance and controversy.

Beginning during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, a Semitic goddess named Qetesh (&quot;holiness&quot;, sometimes reconstructed as &quot;Qudshu&quot;) appears prominently. That dynasty follows expulsion of occupying foreigners from an intermediary period. René Dussard suggested a connection to Asherah in 1941. Subsequent studies tried to find further evidence for equivalence of Qetesh and Asherah, although Wiggins does not. His hesitance did not dissuade subsequent scholars from equating Asherah with Qetesh.

=== In Arabia ===
As &quot;ʾAṯirat&quot; (Qatabanian: &quot;&quot;) she was attested in pre-Islamic south Arabia as the consort of the moon-god &quot;ʿAmm&quot;.

One of the Tema stones (CIS II 113) discovered by Charles Huber in 1883 in the ancient oasis of Tema, northwestern Arabia, and now located at the Louvre, believed to date to the time of Nabonidus&#x27;s retirement there in 549 BC, bears an inscription in Aramaic that mentions &quot;Ṣelem of Maḥram&quot; (), &quot;Šingalāʾ&quot; (), and &quot;ʾAšîrāʾ&quot; () as the deities of Tema. It is unclear whether the name would be an Aramaic vocalisation of the Ugaritic &quot;ʾAṯirat&quot; or a later borrowing of the Hebrew &quot;ʾĂšērāh&quot; or similar form. In any event, Watkins says the root of both names is a Proto-Semitic &quot;*ʾṯrt&quot;. Pritchard excerpts the mention &quot;wšnglʔ wʔšyrʔ ʔlhy tymʔ&quot; and differs on the root&#x27;s meaning.

The Arabic root &quot;ʾṯr&quot; (as in &quot;ʾaṯar&quot;, &quot;trace&quot;) is similar in meaning to the Hebrew &quot;ʾāšar&quot;, indicating &quot;to tread&quot;, used as a basis to explain Asherah&#x27;s epithet &quot;of the sea&quot; as &quot;she who treads the &quot;ym&quot; (sea).&quot;

Asherah survived late in remote South Arabia as seen in some common era Qatabanian and Maʕinian inscriptions.

== Equation with Shapshu ==
The Ugaritic texts reveal significant parallels between the goddesses Athirat and Shapshu, suggesting a possible identification. Both are referred to as &quot;The Lady&quot; (&quot;rbt&quot;), a title signifying supreme authority in the pantheon, and they are described as mothers of the gods, key figures in creation, and central to maintaining cosmic order. Athirat’s epithet &quot;rbt ˀaṯrt ym&quot; has traditionally been interpreted as &quot;Lady Athirat of the Sea,&quot; but recent analyses propose that &quot;ym&quot; might mean &quot;day&quot; instead of &quot;sea.&quot; This reading aligns with Athirat’s name (&quot;ˀaṯrt&quot;), meaning &quot;the one who goes,&quot; reflecting the sun’s journey across the sky.

Another significant reason for this conflation would be a passage found in Ugaritic inscription K1.23 which describes the myth known as &quot;The Gracious and Most Beautiful Gods.&quot; In this text, twins Shahar (dawn) and Shalim (dusk) are described as offspring of El through two women he meets at the seashore. The brothers are both nursed by &quot;The Lady&quot;, likely Asherah and in other Ugaritic texts, the two are associated with the sun goddess Shapshu.

<doc id="251450" wikidata="Q3738162" url="?curid=251450" title="Y (game)">
<text>Y is an abstract strategy board game, first described by John Milnor in the early 1950s. The game was independently invented in 1953 by Craige Schensted and Charles Titus. It is a member of the connection game family inhabited by Hex, Havannah, TwixT, and others; it is also an early member in a long line of games Schensted has developed, each game more complex but also more generalized.

==Gameplay==
Y is typically played on a triangular board with hexagonal spaces; the &quot;official&quot; Y board has three points with five-connectivity instead of six-connectivity, but it is just as playable on a regular triangle. Schensted and Titus&#x27; book &quot;Mudcrack Y &amp; Poly-Y&quot; has a large number of boards for play of Y, all hand-drawn; most of them seem irregular but turn out to be topologically identical to a regular Y board.
As in most games of this type, one player takes the part of Black and one takes the part of White; they place stones on the board one at a time, neither removing nor moving any previously placed stones. The pie rule can be used to mitigate any first-move advantage.

==Rules==
The rules are as follows:
* Players take turns placing one stone of their color on the board.
* Once a player connects all three sides of the board, the game ends and that player wins. The corners count as belonging to both sides of the board to which they are adjacent.

As in most connection games, the size of the board changes the nature of the game; small boards tend towards pure tactical play, whereas larger boards tend to make the game more strategic.

==Relation to other connection games==
Schensted and Titus argue that Y is a superior game to Hex because Hex can be seen as a subset of Y. Consider a board subdivided by a line of white and black pieces into three sections. The portion of the board at the bottom-right can then be considered a 5×5 Hex board, and played identically. However, this sort of artificial construction on a Y board is extremely uncommon, and the games have different enough tactics (outside of constructed situations) to be considered separate, though related.

&quot;Mudcrack Y &amp; Poly-Y&quot; also describes Poly-Y, the next game in the series of Y-related games; after that come Star and *Star.

==Criticism==

Y, like Hex, yields a strong first-player advantage. The standard approach to solving this difficulty is the &quot;pie&quot; rule: one player chooses where the first move will go and the other player then chooses who will be the first player.

Y&#x27;s chief criticism is that on the standard hexagonal board a player controlling center can easily reach any edge no matter what the other player does. This is because the distance from the center to an edge is only approximately 1/3 the distance along the edge from corner to corner. As a result, defending an edge against a center attack is very difficult.

Schensted and Titus attacked this problem with successive versions of the game board, culminating in the present &quot;official&quot; board with three pentagons inserted among the hexagons. They noted that were players to play on a hemisphere rather than a plane with hexagons, with the equator divided into three &quot;sides&quot; (each 1/3 the circumference of the hemisphere), the distance from the &quot;north pole&quot; of the hemisphere to the equator was 1/4 the circumference, and thus the distance ratio improved from 1/3 to 3/4. This made defending a side from a center attack much more plausible. Thus the present &quot;official&quot; board is essentially a geodesic dome hemisphere squashed flat into a triangle to provide this effect.

==No draws==

It has been formally shown that Y cannot end in a draw. That is, once the board is complete there must be one and only one winner.

==The first player wins==

In Y the strategy-stealing argument can be applied. It proves that the second player has no winning strategy. The argument is that if the second player had a winning strategy, then the first player could choose a random first move and then pretend that she is the second player and apply the strategy. An important point is that an extra stone on the board is never a disadvantage in Y. Y is a complete and perfect information game in which no draw can be conceived, so there is a winning strategy for one player. The second player has no winning strategy so the first player has one. It is nevertheless possible for the first player to lose by making a sufficiently bad move, since although that stone has value, it may have significantly less value than the second move—an important consideration for understanding the nature of the pie rule.

If the &quot;pie rule&quot; is in force, however, the second player wins, because the second player can in principle evaluate whether or not the first move is a winning move and choose to invoke the pie rule if it is (thereby effectively becoming the first player).

In practice, assuming the pie rule is in force and the official Schensted/Titus board is being used, Y is a very well balanced game giving essentially equal chances for any two players of equal strength. The balance is achieved because the first player will intentionally make a move that is sufficiently &quot;bad&quot; that it is not clear to the second player whether it is a winning move or a losing move. It is up to the judgement of the second player to make this difficult determination and invoke the pie rule accordingly.

<doc id="251452" wikidata="Q797477" url="?curid=251452" title="Bael (demon)">
<text>Bael (Ba’al or Baal) is a demon described in demonological grimoires such as &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; and the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (where he is the first spirit mentioned) and also in the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;. He is described as a hoarsely-voiced king with the power to make men invisible and ruling over sixty-six legions of demons. &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; describes him as appearing in the form of a cat, toad, human, some combination thereof, or other &quot;diverse shapes&quot;, while the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; and the &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; state that he appears with the heads of a cat, toad, and human simultaneously.

Jacques Collin de Plancy wonders if Bael is the same as the Canaanite deity Baal, a reasonable assumption. In the , Bael (as Beal) is described as a king ruled by Oriens (himself a demon overseeing the cardinal direction east, or the &quot;Orient&quot;), still possessing the power of invisibility, as well as the power to garner the favor of others, but ruling over only six (rather than sixty-six) legions of demons. The &quot;Liber Officiorum Spirituum&quot; features Baal, Baall, Boal, or Boall, again as a hoarsely-voiced king (or sometimes a soldier), with not only the powers of invisibility but also of the sciences and love. Sloane MS 3824 mentions Baal, in &quot;Of the Demon Rulers&quot;, as a king ruled by Oriens, attributed with teaching science, (again) granting invisibility, and controlling 250 legions of spirits. Bael appears in later editions of &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot;, under Astaroth, as a prince whose powers include (again) invisibility and popularity. In the &quot;Grand Grimoire&quot;, Bael (as Baal) is listed as a subordinate of Lucifuge Rofocale. According to Thomas Rudd, Bael is opposed by the Shem HaMephorash angel Vehuiah.

==In popular culture==
* Baal appears as a recurring antagonist in the long-running German dime novel series &quot;Geisterjäger John Sinclair&quot;. The novels and audio dramas by author Jason Dark depict Baal as one of the archdemons along with Astaroth, Eurynome and Amducias.
* In the anime series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans&quot;, a prominent mobile suit is known as &quot;ASW-G-01 Gundam Bael&quot;.
* The former Electro Archon (Makoto) in Genshin Impact also goes by the name Baal. Now the current Electro Archon (Raiden Ei), or Beelzebul, uses the name &quot;Baal&quot; to disguise herself.
* Bael is the demon that possesses Father Lucas Trevant (Played by Anthony Hopkins) in the film The Rite.
* In the Inazuma Eleven cartoon, a Dark Team player is named Bael, referring to the demon of the same name.
* Baal was the featured antagonist in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, the 2001 expansion to Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s hit franchise &quot;Diablo&quot;.
* Baal is a high-ranking demon and one of the main antagonists in Japanese anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.
* Bael is the second-in-command of Hell in the 2024 Korean drama series The Judge from Hell portrayed by actor Shin Sung-rok

<text>The Brights movement is a social movement whose members since 2003 refer to themselves as Brights and have a worldview of philosophical naturalism.

Most Brights believe that public policies should be based on science (a body of knowledge obtained and tested by use of the scientific method). Brights are likely to oppose the practice of basing public policies on supernatural doctrines. Brights may therefore be described as secularists.

== Terminology ==
The Bright movement has proposed the following terminology:
* super (noun): someone whose worldview includes supernatural and/or mystical elements
* bright (noun): someone whose worldview is naturalistic (no supernatural and mystical elements)
* Bright: a bright who has registered on the Bright website as a member of the movement

== History ==
Paul Geisert, who coined the term bright and co-founded the bright movement is a one-time Chicago biology teacher, professor, entrepreneur and writer of learning materials. In deciding to attend the Godless Americans March on Washington in 2002, Geisert disliked the label &quot;godless&quot; because he thought it would alienate the general public to whom that term was synonymous with &quot;evil&quot;. He sought a new, positive word that might be well accepted and improve the image of those who did not believe in the supernatural. A few weeks later, Geisert came up with the noun &quot;bright&quot; after brainstorming many ideas. He then ran into another room and told his wife: &quot;I&#x27;ve got the word, and this is going to be big!&quot;

It was also co-founded by his wife, Mynga Futrell. Futrell remains director of the organization. Paul Geisert died November 17, 2020.

After coming up with the term they pitched their idea to friends and decided to unveil their idea at an Atheist Alliance International conference in Tampa, Florida. They called the organizers and got permission to present the idea.

Geisert and Futrell made their proposal in Spring 2003 at an atheist conference in Florida which was attended by Richard Dawkins. They launched the Brights&#x27; Net website on June 4, 2003. The movement gained early publicity through articles by Richard Dawkins in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;; and by Daniel Dennett in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The movement continued to grow and experienced accelerated registrations following media debate around New Atheism prompted by a series of book releases in late 2006 including &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot;, &quot;God Is Not Great&quot;, &quot;The End of Faith&quot; and &quot;Letter to a Christian Nation&quot;. The movement has grown to be a constituency of over 78,000 Brights in 204 nations and territories. 

== Brights == 

Many, but not all, brights also identify as atheist, antitheist, humanist (specifically secular humanist), freethinker, irreligionist, naturalist, materialist or physicalist, agnostic, skeptic, or even naturalistic pantheist. Even so, the &quot;movement is not associated with any defined beliefs&quot;. The website Brights&#x27; Net says its goal is to include the umbrella term bright in the vocabulary of this existing &quot;community of reason&quot;.

However, &quot;the broader intent is inclusive of the many-varied persons whose worldview is naturalistic&quot;, but are in the &quot;general population&quot; as opposed to associating solely with the &quot;community of reason&quot;. Thus, persons who can declare their naturalistic worldview using the term bright extend beyond the familiar secularist categories as long as they do not hold theistic worldviews. Registrations even include some members of the clergy, such as Presbyterian ministers and a Church History Professor and ordained priest.

Dawkins compares the coining of bright to the &quot;triumph of consciousness-raising&quot; from the term gay:
Gay is succinct, uplifting, positive: an &quot;up&quot; word, where homosexual is a down word, and queer, faggot and pooftah are insults. Those of us who subscribe to no religion; those of us whose view of the universe is natural rather than supernatural; those of us who rejoice in the real and scorn the false comfort of the unreal, we need a word of our own, a word like &quot;gay&quot;[,] [...] a noun hijacked from an adjective, with its original meaning changed but not too much. Like gay, it should be catchy: a potentially prolific meme. Like gay, it should be positive, warm, cheerful, bright.

Despite the explicit difference between the noun and adjective, there have been comments on the comparison. In his &quot;Wired&quot; article, Dawkins stated: &quot;Whether there is a statistical tendency for brights [noun] to be bright [adjective] is a matter for research&quot;.

Notable people who have self-identified as brights at one time or another include: biologists Richard Dawkins and Richard J. Roberts; cognitive scientist Steven Pinker; philosophers Daniel Dennett and Massimo Pigliucci; stage magicians and debunkers James Randi and Penn &amp; Teller; Amy Alkon; Sheldon Glashow; Babu Gogineni; Edwin Kagin; Mel Lipman; Piergiorgio Odifreddi; and Air America Radio talk show host Lionel.

=== Contrasted with supers ===
Daniel Dennett suggests in his book &quot;Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon&quot; that if non-naturalists are concerned with connotations of the word bright, then they should invent an equally positive sounding word for themselves, like supers (i.e. one whose world view contains supernaturalism). He also suggested this during his presentation at the Atheist Alliance International &#x27;07 convention. Geisert and Futrell maintain that the neologism has always had a kinship with the Enlightenment, an era which celebrated the possibilities of science and a certain amount of free inquiry. They have endorsed the use of super as the antonym to bright.

== Symbol ==
The Brights&#x27; avatar represents a celestial body viewed from space. As there is no up or down or right or left in outer space, the arrangement of planet and darkness and starlight is changeable. Although the symbol is open to the viewer&#x27;s interpretation, it is generally meant to invoke transition and a sense of gradual illumination. The intentional ambiguity of the avatar is meant to symbolically reflect an important question: Is the future of humankind becoming luminous or more dim? The Brights aspire &quot;to take the promising route, whereby the imagery brings to mind a gradually increasing illumination for this earth of ours, an escalation of enlightenment&quot;. This optimistic interpretation of the Brights&#x27; symbol is summarized by the motto &quot;Embrightenment Now!&quot;.

== Name controversy ==
The movement has been criticised by some (both religious and non-religious) who have objected to the adoption of the title &quot;bright&quot; because they believe it suggests that the individuals with a naturalistic worldview are more intelligent (&quot;brighter&quot;) than non-naturalists, such as philosophical skeptics or idealists, believers in the paranormal, philosophical theists, or the religious. For example, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry published an article by Chris Mooney titled &quot;Not Too &#x27;Bright in which he stated that although he agreed with the movement, Richard Dawkins&#x27;s and Daniel Dennett&#x27;s &quot;campaign to rename religious unbelievers &#x27;brights&#x27; could use some rethinking&quot; because of the possibility that the term would be misinterpreted. The journalist and noted atheist Christopher Hitchens likewise found it a &quot;cringe-making proposal that atheists should conceitedly nominate themselves to be called &#x27;brights.

In response to this, Daniel Dennett has stated:

<text>The common pochard (; Aythya ferina), known simply as pochard in the United Kingdom, is a medium-sized diving duck in the family Anatidae. It is widespread across the Palearctic. It breeds primarily in the steppe regions of Scandinavia and Siberia, and winters further south and west.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus first assigned a scientific name to the common pochard in the tenth edition of his landmark treatise Systema Naturae; this was the first edition which included such names. He called the duck &quot;Anas ferina&quot;. In 1822, German zoologist Friedrich Boie created the genus &quot;Aythya&quot; for various diving ducks, and moved the common pochard to that new genus. Uptake of &quot;Aythya&quot; as the genus for the common pochard was mixed for much of the next century, with some authors leaving the duck in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; or assigning it to various other now-defunct genera instead. The common pochard is considered a superspecies with the canvasback. In the past, the redhead of North America was thought to be a subspecies, but the common pochard is now agreed to be monotypic, with no subspecies. It is known to have hybridised with tufted duck and ferruginous duck in captivity, and these known combinations resemble suspected hybrids seen in the wild, which may share the same parentage. Hybridisations with the red-crested pochard have also been reported.

The genus name &quot;Aythya&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word &quot;aithuia&quot;, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle. The species name is the Latin word &quot;ferina&quot;, meaning &quot;wild game&quot; (derived from &quot;ferus&quot;, meaning &quot;wild&quot;). The common name &quot;pochard&quot; was first applied to the duck in the mid-1500s; its origin and etymology is unknown. It is also sometimes known as European pochard, Eurasian pochard, or (particularly in the UK) simply pochard.

== Description ==
The common pochard is a plump, medium-sized diving duck, measuring in length, with a wingspan of . It is stocky and short-tailed, with a sloping forehead and relatively long bill. Its weight (which has been reported only for winter birds) ranges from . Males average larger and heavier than females. Like most ducks, it is sexually dimorphic.

The male has a chestnut-coloured head and neck, a black breast and tail, and a pale grey body, marked with fine vermiculations. His bill is dark grey, with a wide blue-grey band across the middle. His iris is yellow-orange to red, growing brighter in the breeding season.

The legs and feet are grey in both sexes and all ages. The female&#x27;s iris is brown, sometimes tending towards yellowish-brown. The juvenile&#x27;s iris is yellow-olive, but attains its adult colour during the first winter.

=== Voice ===
The male is generally silent, though he may whistle softly as part of his courtship display. The female growls softly—a sound transcribed as &quot;krrr&quot;—if she is flushed. The duckling has a short contact call of two to four notes. If distressed, its calls are higher and faster than are those of &quot;Anas&quot; ducklings of the same size and age.

=== Similar species ===
The male common pochard is quite similar to the male canvasback, but the latter has an all-dark bill. It is also similar to the redhead, but the latter has a yellow iris and a greyer back.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Their breeding habitat consists of marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. Pochards breed in much of temperate and northern Europe and across the Palearctic. They are migratory, and spend winter in the south and west of Europe.

In the British Isles, birds breed in eastern England and lowland Scotland, in small numbers in Northern Ireland with numbers increasing gradually, and sporadically in the Republic of Ireland, where it may also be increasing. While uncommon, individuals are also occasionally seen in the south of England, and small populations are sometimes observed on the River Thames. Large numbers stay overwinter in Great Britain, after the birds retreat from Russia and Scandinavia.

== Ecology ==
These are gregarious birds; they form large flocks in winter, often mixing with other species of diving duck. They are strong fliers; in direct, flapping flight, they can reach speeds of .

=== Food and feeding ===
Common pochards feed on plant material (including seeds), small fish, molluscs, and other aquatic invertebrates. They feed primarily by diving to retrieve items from under the water&#x27;s surface; however, they will also upend and dabble at items on the water&#x27;s surface. They do most of their feeding at night.

They regularly forage in close association with Bewick&#x27;s and whooper swans, two species that trample underwater sediment to excavate food. Studies have shown that this behaviour greatly increases the food intake rate of the pochards, as they glean food items that drift away from where the swans are trampling. This rate can be double what it would be if the birds were feeding on their own.

=== Breeding ===

The female builds a platform nest of plant material, with a shallow cup lined with down feathers near its centre. This is placed either on the ground within of the water&#x27;s edge or in the water with the platform rising above the water&#x27;s surface. It is always located in dense cover. The female lays one egg daily until her clutch—typically 8–10 eggs—is complete. Only then does she begin incubation. The eggs are greenish-grey and broadly oval, measuring on average. They are incubated by the female and hatch synchronously after around 25 days. When off the nest the female will cover the eggs with down. The young are precocial, nidifugous and can feed themselves. They fledge when aged 50–55 days.

Like many ducks, common pochards suffer a high rate of parasitic egg-laying, a behaviour also known as egg dumping. Studies have shown that as many as 89% of nests in some areas contain one or more eggs not laid by the incubating female. The percentage of parasitic eggs may reach as high as 37% of all eggs laid in some populations. There appears to be little cost to the incubating female for accepting eggs that are not her own, and indeed she will roll any egg left close to her nest into her clutch. However, if the number of parasitic eggs exceeds six, she is twice as likely to abandon her nest. Females sometimes lay their eggs in the nests of other duck species as well; red-crested pochards are unwitting hosts in some areas.

Levels of nest predation can be high, particularly for nests located in upland areas. Those located on islands, or over water (on artificial platforms) do significantly better, presumably because water deters at least some mammalian predators. Nesting success depends on a number of factors, including the age of the female, her body mass, the date the nest was started, and the size of the clutch. Older, heavier birds are more successful than younger, lighter ones. Smaller, earlier-laid clutches are less likely to be abandoned than larger, later ones.

== Conservation and threats ==

The common pochard is one of the species protected by the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA). The International Union for Conservation of Nature rates the species as vulnerable. Though it has a huge range and an extremely large population, there is evidence of precipitous declines in several regions. These reach somewhere in the range of 30–49 per cent over a 23-year period in Europe, for example. In number of countries, its population is decreasing mainly due to the urbanization and transformation of the natural habitats, as well as due to overhunting. Introduced predators, such as the American mink, have wreaked havoc on some populations. In Poland, for example, one studied population showed a 92 per cent decrease in the 30 years after mink first became established in the area. Birds, including carrion crows and marsh harriers are important nest predators.

A further threat to conservation efforts of this bird is that 75 official languages are spoken across the countries in which it is found, thus scientific knowledge is scattered across those different languages, and collaboration on conservation efforts is more difficult.

It is the host for a variety of internal parasites, including cestodes, nematodes and trematodes. These include &quot;Paramonostomum aythyae&quot;, a trematode which was first isolated from the common pochard; it is carried in the gut. In some locations, the common pochard may be an important vector of avian schistosomes, which are harboured in the bird&#x27;s nasal and mesenteric blood vessels. These schistosomes can be transmitted to humans who work or swim in the same wetland areas as the ducks, potentially causing cercarial dermatitis. Known blood parasites include &quot;Haemoproteus greineri&quot;, &quot;Haemoproteus nettionis&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium circumflexum&quot;. It is also known to carry &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;.

<text>Preparation H is an American brand of medications that is made by Pfizer, used in the treatment of hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are caused at least in part by inflamed blood vessels, and most versions of Preparation H work by reducing inflammation in blood vessels.

The company that makes this product incorporated in 1926 as American Home Products (AHP) and &quot;one of AHP&#x27;s earliest prizes was the acquisition of a sunburn oil in 1935 that the company transformed into Preparation H, which became one of the world&#x27;s best-selling hemorrhoid treatments.&quot; AHP changed its name to Wyeth in 2002, and was then bought by Pfizer in 2009, which was reported to have paid $68 billion.

==Formulations==
Several formulations have been produced. Some are in a water-based gel while others are petroleum jelly-based, and the suppositories use a base of cocoa butter. It also comes as a medicated wipe. The active ingredients range from simple caffeine moisturizers with witch-hazel astringent to preparations containing drugs such as phenylephrine, pramoxine, and hydrocortisone. Formulations vary from one country to another. Some Preparation H products have phenylephrine, a drug that constricts blood vessels, in a 0.25% concentration, as well as shark liver oil. Another version of Preparation H has hydrocortisone as its only active ingredient in a 1% concentration.

The Canadian formulation of Preparation H includes a yeast extract called Biodyne which was removed in 1995 from the formulation sold in the United States. This yeast extract was the primary ingredient of the original formulation by inventor George Sperti, and Pfizer believes that it removes wrinkles from skin and heals dry, cracked, and irritated skin. The Canadian formulation has acquired a market in the United States as a skin cream with an anti-wrinkle active ingredient. In Greece, the active ingredients of Preparation H are 1% w/w yeast extract and 3% w/w shark liver oil.

<text>The weather gage (sometimes spelled weather gauge) is the advantageous position of a fighting sailing vessel relative to another. It is also known as &quot;nautical gauge&quot; as it is related to the sea shore. The concept is from the Age of Sail and is now antique. A ship at sea is said to possess the weather gage if it is in any position upwind of the other vessel. Proximity with the land, tidal and stream effects and wind variability due to geography (hills, cliffs, etc.) may also come into play.

An upwind vessel is able to manoeuvre at will toward any downwind point, since the relative wind then moves aft. A vessel downwind of another, in attempting to attack upwind, is constrained to trim sail as the relative wind moves forward and cannot point too far into the wind for fear of being headed. In sailing warfare, when beating to windward, the vessel experiences heeling under the sideward pressure of the wind. This restricts gunnery, as cannon on the windward side are elevated, while the leeward gun ports aim into the sea or in heavy weather may be awash. A ship with the weather gage, turning downwind to attack, may alter course at will to bring starboard and port guns to appropriate elevations. Ships seeking to evade capture or attack have the advantage being downwind if they are faster vessels or are close to friendly land. The term has had a literary rebirth in the popular seafaring novels of C.S. Forester, Patrick O&#x27;Brian and Alexander Kent.

One of the last times that &quot;weather gage&quot; was perhaps a factor in a surface naval engagement was in the Battle of the Denmark Strait in 1941, where the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and the heavy cruiser &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; held the weather gage over the British battleship and the battlecruiser . Being upwind, the German ships had the advantage that their rangefinders were drier than the British rangefinders facing the spray. The weather restricted the visual range to much less than the gun range.

The weather gage is a critical component of aircraft carrier operations. Most carrier aircraft are easier to launch if the aircraft carrier is steaming into the wind to generate stronger apparent winds across the deck that allows for greater lift to be generated at lower actual speeds. The Battle of the Philippine Sea is a notable incident of the advantage of the weather gage for carrier operations. American carriers were upwind of the Japanese carriers. Every time an American aircraft carrier conducted flight operations, they opened the range to the Japanese fleet. Japanese carriers could conduct flight operations while closing the range to the American fleet. 

The concept of weather gage is still useful in modern yacht racing, although the term is rarely used. The sails of a boat disrupt the wind to leeward; this disruption is often called &quot;dirt&quot; or &quot;dirty air&quot;. An overtaking boat on a downwind course can position itself to focus its dirty air on the boat ahead of it. Conversely, a boat on an upwind course may find itself trapped in the dirty air of a boat immediately to windward. Right-of-way rules give priority to the leeward boat and can make it advantageous to be the boat without the weather gage, especially just before the start or when the boat to leeward can point higher into the wind.

== Weather gauge ==
&quot;Gauge&quot; and &quot;gage&quot; are often used as alternative spellings. To the extent that there is a difference, a &quot;weather gauge&quot; can be a form of meteorological instrumentation for measuring weather quantitatively, such as a rain gauge, thermometer, anemometer, or barometer. A &quot;gage&quot; is a challenge, and hence an entry into battle, though the word is more commonly embedded in the word &quot;engage&quot;.

<text>The Cape Flats () is an expansive, low-lying, flat area situated to the southeast of the central business district of Cape Town. The Cape Flats is also the name of an administrative region of the City of Cape Town, which lies within the larger geographical area.

==Geology and geography==

In geological terms, the area that makes up The Cape Flats is a vast sheet of aeolian sand, ultimately of marine origin, which has blown up from the adjacent beaches over a period of a hundred thousand years. Below the sand, the bedrock is in general alternating layers of dark grey shale, siltstone and minor sandstone from a late-Precambrian rock formation called the Malmesbury Group. This is except on part of the western margin between Zeekoevlei to the south and Claremont and Wetton to the north, where an intrusive mass of Cape granite is to be found. Most of the sand is unconsolidated; however, in some places near the False Bay coast the oldest sand dunes have been cemented into a soft sandstone (calcrete), and form low cliffs at the edge of the beach. These formations contain important fossils of animals such as the extinct Cape lion and also provide evidence that stone-age people hunted here tens of thousands of years ago.
===Extent===
To the west the expanse of the Cape Flats is limited by rising ground that slopes up to the steep cliffs of the Cape Peninsula mountain chain, while in the east the land rises gradually towards the equally rugged cliffs of Hottentots Holland mountains and other elevated regions of the interior of the Boland.

===Climate===
The area has a Mediterranean climate, with warm dry summers and cool, damp winters. It is generally exposed to the wind, both from the northwest (winter) and southeast (summer). Flooding can be a problem, especially in July and August. Cold wet spells, especially in August and September, can make life very difficult for those living in sub-standard housing. it is a great place to be sometimes, other times the worst.
===Drainage===
Historically the Cape Flats was partly covered in wetlands, particularly during winter. Many of these have been destroyed by canalisation and infilling to provide residential space. Many of the remaining perennial vleis such as Zeekoevlei, Rondevlei and Zandvlei are at the southwest side of the region.

==History==

===Before 1950===
The noted English naturalist, William John Burchell, remarked in 1811 that the deep sand of the Flats made travel by cart or wagon extremely difficult. The situation was aggravated by a widespread shortage of firewood, causing fuel collectors to cut the relatively few indigenous shrubs and trees that stabilised the sand.

During the second half of the 19th century, the area was completely overrun by alien vegetation, mainly of Australian origin. The plants included hakeas and especially wattles (genus Acacia). The principal reason for this infestation lay in decisions made by the colonial authorities. It was an era before the advent of modern technological methods for the construction of permanent roads and in those days the Cape Flats was a massive sea of unstabilised sand dunes that moved with the winds. This made travel between Cape Town and the interior very difficult, particularly for the large ox-drawn wagons of the time. The authorities decided to try to stabilise the sand with plants native to the British colonies of New South Wales and Western Australia.

The earliest importation of wattles was in 1827. Massive plantings were established in the 1840s and 1850s and the work continued until well after 1875. At the time, the plan worked well enough: the march of the dunes was arrested. The price paid, in ecological terms, was that the Cape Flats was carpeted by invasive species. Serious efforts have in recent years been made to roll back this alien scourge.

===Since 1950===

The Cape Flats has undergone dramatic change in the past half a century. In 1950 the area was practically uninhabited. There was a single, narrow road across the Flats from Cape Town to The Strand that ran between walls of alien rooikrans bushes and one could travel for miles without seeing any sign of habitation other than a few fences and a handful of farmhouses. Native antelope roamed at will between the dense thickets of wattles. The army used the area for military exercises and the few farmers who inhabited the Flats eked out a living by growing vegetables in pockets of relatively poor soil between the barren dunes. Modern amenities were unknown; telephones were unknown, drinking water was collected in tanks from roofs and at night the rooms were lit by oil lamps.

The era of sand and antelopes vanished completely in little more than a generation. Vegetable farming persisted, but to a much lesser extent, because urbanisation enveloped vast tracts of land in short order.

The first use of the Cape Flats to remove people of colour from the more central urban areas was the township of Langa, which saw large scale removal after the Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923. It is the oldest township in Cape Town and was the location of much resistance to apartheid. Its origins go back to the 19th century.

During the apartheid era, race-based legislation such as the Group Areas Act and pass laws either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Cape Flats, or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people into informal settlements elsewhere in the Cape Flats. Large housing projects were built here, mostly as part of the Nationalist government&#x27;s larger effort to force the so-called Coloured communities and other people of Colour (mostly Xhosa) out of the central and western areas of Cape Town, which were designated as white areas under the Group Areas Act.

This meant that only white people could reside there permanently, as under the apartheid system black Africans were officially made citizens of native reserves (called &quot;homelands&quot;), therefore having resident worker status, despite often never having been there &amp; having spent their entire lives in the now &quot;designated white&quot; regions.

Since many of the mostly Xhosa workers and their families, were designated under apartheid as citizens of assigned native reserves/homelands, many who were out of formal work were obliged to live in the area illegally, further contributing to the growth of informal settlements.

In addition to the extant townships of the mid-century, other large townships (such as Mitchell&#x27;s Plain &amp; Khayelitsha across the road) were created on the flats in the 1970s and 1980s. Both have become among the largest residential areas in Cape Town and some of the largest in the country at large.

Large scale rural-urban migration has rapidly increased the population, putting strain on housing with major increases in informal shack settlement, including in areas that were originally created on a planned basis, for example, Khayelitsha.

One of the major priorities of the RDP (Reconstruction &amp; Development Programme) is to build houses.

Since the end of apartheid, these communities are no longer legally bound by racial restrictions; but history, language, economics and ethnic politics still contribute to homogeneity of local areas. So, for example, most residents of Mitchell&#x27;s Plain likely still speak a locally inflected version of Afrikaans, along with English and either they or their parents were designated as Coloured by apartheid; most residents of Khayelitsha still speak Xhosa and English and either they or their parents were designated as Black by apartheid. Nonetheless, some areas of the Cape Flats have an increasing diversity of residents, with Xhosa-speaking people an increasingly noticeable presence in some previously mainly Afrikaans-speaking areas.

==Culture and politics==
Popular musicians from the area include pop singer Brenda Fassie and jazz artists Abdullah Ibrahim and Basil Coetzee, who named their song &quot;Mannenberg&quot; after a Cape Flats township. There is an active hip hop movement.

Its religious communities include (to name only a few) Afrikaans-speaking congregations of the Dutch Reformed Church, Rastafarian communities, people who engage only in traditional Xhosa practices, syncretic Xhosa Christian churches, evangelical Christian churches, and southern Africa&#x27;s largest Muslim community (drawing its oldest roots from the historic Cape Malay community, which dates to the 17th century).

In the 1940s, a type of dental modification known as a &quot;passion gap&quot; became fashionable and remains popular today. The modification involves the removal of a person&#x27;s top front teeth.

The Cape Flats&#x27; political history is complex and sometimes baffling even to insiders: for instance, the politics of the Coloured communities of the Cape Flats have included Trotskyist activism in earlier years, and mobilisation for the ANC&#x27;s United Democratic Front in the 80s; and then, widespread support for the historically white National Party (which had presided over apartheid) in the early post-apartheid elections. More recently, the area has seen an expansion of African National Congress strength from its base in the Black townships and into historically Coloured areas, as well as a particularly strong local growth of left-wing social movements like the Treatment Action Campaign which offer a critique of government policies.

==Crime==
The Cape Flats is sometimes considered dangerous, although most communities are tight-knit, diverse and tolerant with vibrant cultures and traditions.

Almost all of the communities of the Cape Flats remain, to one degree or another, poverty-stricken. Serious social problems include a high rate of unemployment and high levels of gang activity. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was significant armed conflict between various gangs and PAGAD (People Against Gangsterism and Drugs), a vigilante organisation. Post-apartheid development projects, such as the Reconstruction &amp; Development Programme, have also led to violent conflicts within communities. As of 2014, efforts to combat gangs include Hanover Park&#x27;s Ceasefire programme, where former gang members &quot;use their experiences to mediate gang disputes and help young men and women quit gang life. The gang violence escalated to the point where the South African National Defence Force had to be deployed to the gang-impacted areas of the Cape Flats to help the provincial police force deal with the increasing gang violence.

Some well-known criminal organisations based in the Cape Flats include:
* &quot;The Americans&quot;: one of the largest gangs in the Cape Flats, known for their violent tactics and their involvement in drug trafficking.
* &quot;The Hard Livings&quot;: a Cape Flats-based gang known for drug trafficking and operating extortion rings.
* &quot;The Junky Funky Kids (JFK)&quot;: the &quot;JFK&quot; gang has recently been engaged in a violent turf-war with The Americans gang, and in 2017, 4 of its members were sentenced to life for murder.

A wide range of community empowerment organisations work non-violently to combat the poverty, crime and health problems, and the role of civil society in many parts of the area is relatively strong. In late 2019, South African political group, the TRAKboys began enforcing a ceasefire between the gangs in Cape Flats. Citing the repeated failure of government initiatives aimed at curbing gun violence in Cape Flats, the TRAKboys created a system of community justice and enacted harsh punishments on any gang members found to be plotting violence on any members of a rival gang or a fellow Cape Flats resident.

==Suburbs on the Cape Flats==
The Cape Flats is a low-lying area situated to the southeast of Cape Town&#x27;s central business district. It is known for its rich cultural history and diverse communities. Below is a list of notable suburbs on the Cape Flats:

* Athlone – Known as a cultural hub with significant historical ties to the anti-apartheid struggle.
* Bonteheuwel – A predominantly Coloured community, also central to the anti-apartheid movement.
* Hanover Park – A densely populated area with ongoing urban development initiatives.
* Khayelitsha – One of the largest townships in South Africa, established during apartheid.

<text>In mathematics, a quadratic form is a polynomial with terms all of degree two (&quot;form&quot; is another name for a homogeneous polynomial). For example, 
formula_1

is a quadratic form in the variables and . The coefficients usually belong to a fixed field , such as the real or complex numbers, and one speaks of a quadratic form &quot;over&quot; . Over the reals, a quadratic form is said to be &quot;definite&quot; if it takes the value zero only when all its variables are simultaneously zero; otherwise it is &quot;isotropic&quot;.

Quadratic forms occupy a central place in various branches of mathematics, including number theory, linear algebra, group theory (orthogonal groups), differential geometry (the Riemannian metric, the second fundamental form), differential topology (intersection forms of manifolds, especially four-manifolds), Lie theory (the Killing form), and statistics (where the exponent of a zero-mean multivariate normal distribution has the quadratic form formula_2) 

Quadratic forms are not to be confused with quadratic equations, which have only one variable and may include terms of degree less than two. A quadratic form is a specific instance of the more general concept of forms.

== Introduction ==
Quadratic forms are homogeneous quadratic polynomials in variables. In the cases of one, two, and three variables they are called unary, binary, and ternary and have the following explicit form:
formula_3

where , ..., are the coefficients.

The theory of quadratic forms and methods used in their study depend in a large measure on the nature of the coefficients, which may be real or complex numbers, rational numbers, or integers. In linear algebra, analytic geometry, and in the majority of applications of quadratic forms, the coefficients are real or complex numbers. In the algebraic theory of quadratic forms, the coefficients are elements of a certain field. In the arithmetic theory of quadratic forms, the coefficients belong to a fixed commutative ring, frequently the integers or the -adic integers . Binary quadratic forms have been extensively studied in number theory, in particular, in the theory of quadratic fields, continued fractions, and modular forms. The theory of integral quadratic forms in variables has important applications to algebraic topology.

Using homogeneous coordinates, a non-zero quadratic form in variables defines an -dimensional quadric in the -dimensional projective space. This is a basic construction in projective geometry. In this way one may visualize 3-dimensional real quadratic forms as conic sections.
An example is given by the three-dimensional Euclidean space and the square of the Euclidean norm expressing the distance between a point with coordinates and the origin:
formula_4

A closely related notion with geometric overtones is a quadratic space, which is a pair , with a vector space over a field , and a quadratic form on &quot;V&quot;. See &quot;&quot; below for the definition of a quadratic form on a vector space.

== History ==
The study of quadratic forms, in particular the question of whether a given integer can be the value of a quadratic form over the integers, dates back many centuries. One such case is Fermat&#x27;s theorem on sums of two squares, which determines when an integer may be expressed in the form , where , are integers. This problem is related to the problem of finding Pythagorean triples, which appeared in the second millennium BCE.

In 628, the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta wrote &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot;, which includes, among many other things, a study of equations of the form . He considered what is now called Pell&#x27;s equation, , and found a method for its solution. In Europe this problem was studied by Brouncker, Euler and Lagrange.

In 1801 Gauss published &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; a major portion of which was devoted to a complete theory of binary quadratic forms over the integers. Since then, the concept has been generalized, and the connections with quadratic number fields, the modular group, and other areas of mathematics have been further elucidated.

== Associated symmetric matrix ==
Any matrix determines a quadratic form in variables by
formula_5
where .

=== Example ===
Consider the case of quadratic forms in three variables . The matrix has the form
formula_6

The above formula gives
formula_7

So, two different matrices define the same quadratic form if and only if they have the same elements on the diagonal and the same values for the sums , and . In particular, the quadratic form is defined by a unique symmetric matrix
formula_8

This generalizes to any number of variables as follows.

=== General case ===
Given a quadratic form over the real numbers, defined by the matrix ,
the matrix
formula_9
is symmetric, defines the same quadratic form as , and is the unique symmetric matrix that defines .

So, over the real numbers (and, more generally, over a field of characteristic different from two), there is a one-to-one correspondence between quadratic forms and symmetric matrices that determine them.

== Real quadratic forms ==

A fundamental problem is the classification of real quadratic forms under a linear change of variables.

Jacobi proved that, for every real quadratic form, there is an orthogonal diagonalization; that is, an orthogonal change of variables that puts the quadratic form in a &quot;diagonal form&quot;
formula_10
where the associated symmetric matrix is diagonal. Moreover, the coefficients are determined uniquely up to a permutation.

If the change of variables is given by an invertible matrix that is not necessarily orthogonal, one can suppose that all coefficients are 0, 1, or −1. Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia states that the numbers of each 0, 1, and −1 are invariants of the quadratic form, in the sense that any other diagonalization will contain the same number of each. The signature of the quadratic form is the triple , where these components count the number of 0s, number of 1s, and the number of −1s, respectively. Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia shows that this is a well-defined quantity attached to the quadratic form.

The case when all have the same sign is especially important: in this case the quadratic form is called positive definite (all 1) or negative definite (all −1). If none of the terms are 0, then the form is called ; this includes positive definite, negative definite, and isotropic quadratic form (a mix of 1 and −1); equivalently, a nondegenerate quadratic form is one whose associated symmetric form is a nondegenerate &quot;bilinear&quot; form. A real vector space with an indefinite nondegenerate quadratic form of index (denoting 1s and −1s) is often denoted as particularly in the physical theory of spacetime.

The discriminant of a quadratic form, concretely the class of the determinant of a representing matrix in (up to non-zero squares) can also be defined, and for a real quadratic form is a cruder invariant than signature, taking values of only &quot;positive, zero, or negative&quot;. Zero corresponds to degenerate, while for a non-degenerate form it is the parity of the number of negative coefficients, .

These results are reformulated in a different way below.

Let be a quadratic form defined on an -dimensional real vector space. Let be the matrix of the quadratic form in a given basis. This means that is a symmetric matrix such that
formula_11
where &quot;x&quot; is the column vector of coordinates of in the chosen basis. Under a change of basis, the column is multiplied on the left by an invertible matrix , and the symmetric square matrix is transformed into another symmetric square matrix of the same size according to the formula
formula_12

Any symmetric matrix can be transformed into a diagonal matrix
formula_13
by a suitable choice of an orthogonal matrix , and the diagonal entries of are uniquely determined – this is Jacobi&#x27;s theorem. If is allowed to be any invertible matrix then can be made to have only 0, 1, and −1 on the diagonal, and the number of the entries of each type ( for 0, for 1, and for −1) depends only on . This is one of the formulations of Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia and the numbers and are called the positive and negative indices of inertia. Although their definition involved a choice of basis and consideration of the corresponding real symmetric matrix , Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia means that they are invariants of the quadratic form .

The quadratic form is positive definite if (similarly, negative definite if ) for every nonzero vector . When assumes both positive and negative values, is an isotropic quadratic form. The theorems of Jacobi and Sylvester show that any positive definite quadratic form in variables can be brought to the sum of squares by a suitable invertible linear transformation: geometrically, there is only &quot;one&quot; positive definite real quadratic form of every dimension. Its isometry group is a &quot;compact&quot; orthogonal group . This stands in contrast with the case of isotropic forms, when the corresponding group, the indefinite orthogonal group , is non-compact. Further, the isometry groups of and are the same (, but the associated Clifford algebras (and hence pin groups) are different.

== Definitions ==
A quadratic form over a field is a map from a finite-dimensional -vector space to such that for all , and the function is bilinear.

More concretely, an -ary quadratic form over a field is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in variables with coefficients in :
formula_14

This formula may be rewritten using matrices: let be the column vector with components , ..., and be the matrix over whose entries are the coefficients of . Then
formula_15

A vector is a null vector if .

Two -ary quadratic forms and over are equivalent if there exists a nonsingular linear transformation such that
formula_16

Let the characteristic of be different from 2. The coefficient matrix of may be replaced by the symmetric matrix with the same quadratic form, so it may be assumed from the outset that is symmetric. Moreover, a symmetric matrix is uniquely determined by the corresponding quadratic form. Under an equivalence , the symmetric matrix of and the symmetric matrix of are related as follows:
formula_17

The associated bilinear form of a quadratic form is defined by
formula_18

Thus, is a symmetric bilinear form over with matrix . Conversely, any symmetric bilinear form defines a quadratic form
formula_19
and these two processes are the inverses of each other. As a consequence, over a field of characteristic not equal to 2, the theories of symmetric bilinear forms and of quadratic forms in variables are essentially the same.

=== Quadratic space ===

Given an -dimensional vector space over a field , a &quot;quadratic form&quot; on is a function that has the following property: for some basis, the function that maps the coordinates of to is a quadratic form. In particular, if with its standard basis, one has 
formula_20

The change of basis formulas show that the property of being a quadratic form does not depend on the choice of a specific basis in , although the quadratic form depends on the choice of the basis.

A finite-dimensional vector space with a quadratic form is called a quadratic space.

The map is a homogeneous function of degree 2, which means that it has the property that, for all in and in :
formula_21

When the characteristic of is not 2, the bilinear map over is defined:
formula_22
This bilinear form is symmetric. That is, for all , in , and it determines : for all in .

When the characteristic of is 2, so that 2 is not a unit, it is still possible to use a quadratic form to define a symmetric bilinear form . However, can no longer be recovered from this in the same way, since for all (and is thus alternating). Alternatively, there always exists a bilinear form (not in general either unique or symmetric) such that .

The pair consisting of a finite-dimensional vector space over and a quadratic map from to is called a quadratic space, and as defined here is the associated symmetric bilinear form of . The notion of a quadratic space is a coordinate-free version of the notion of quadratic form. Sometimes, is also called a quadratic form.

Two -dimensional quadratic spaces and are isometric if there exists an invertible linear transformation (isometry) such that
formula_23

The isometry classes of -dimensional quadratic spaces over correspond to the equivalence classes of -ary quadratic forms over .

=== Generalization ===
Let be a commutative ring, be an -module, and be an -bilinear form. A mapping is the &quot;associated quadratic form&quot; of , and is the &quot;polar form&quot; of .

A quadratic form may be characterized in the following equivalent ways:
* There exists an -bilinear form such that is the associated quadratic form.
* for all and , and the polar form of is -bilinear.

=== Related concepts ===

Two elements and of are called orthogonal if . The kernel of a bilinear form consists of the elements that are orthogonal to every element of . is non-singular if the kernel of its associated bilinear form is . If there exists a non-zero in such that , the quadratic form is isotropic, otherwise it is definite. This terminology also applies to vectors and subspaces of a quadratic space. If the restriction of to a subspace of is identically zero, then is totally singular.

The orthogonal group of a non-singular quadratic form is the group of the linear automorphisms of that preserve : that is, the group of isometries of into itself.

If a quadratic space has a product so that is an algebra over a field, and satisfies
formula_24 then it is a composition algebra.

== Equivalence of forms ==
Every quadratic form in variables over a field of characteristic not equal to 2 is equivalent to a diagonal form
formula_25

Such a diagonal form is often denoted by .
Classification of all quadratic forms up to equivalence can thus be reduced to the case of diagonal forms.

== Geometric meaning ==
Using Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions, let , and let be a symmetric 3-by-3 matrix. Then the geometric nature of the solution set of the equation depends on the eigenvalues of the matrix .

If all eigenvalues of are non-zero, then the solution set is an ellipsoid or a hyperboloid. If all the eigenvalues are positive, then it is an ellipsoid; if all the eigenvalues are negative, then it is an &quot;imaginary ellipsoid&quot; (we get the equation of an ellipsoid but with imaginary radii); if some eigenvalues are positive and some are negative, then it is a hyperboloid.

If there exist one or more eigenvalues , then the shape depends on the corresponding . If the corresponding , then the solution set is a paraboloid (either elliptic or hyperbolic); if the corresponding , then the dimension degenerates and does not come into play, and the geometric meaning will be determined by other eigenvalues and other components of . When the solution set is a paraboloid, whether it is elliptic or hyperbolic is determined by whether all other non-zero eigenvalues are of the same sign: if they are, then it is elliptic; otherwise, it is hyperbolic.

== Integral quadratic forms ==
Quadratic forms over the ring of integers are called integral quadratic forms, whereas the corresponding modules are quadratic lattices (sometimes, simply lattices). They play an important role in number theory and topology.

An integral quadratic form has integer coefficients, such as ; equivalently, given a lattice in a vector space (over a field with characteristic 0, such as or ), a quadratic form is integral &quot;with respect to&quot; if and only if it is integer-valued on , meaning if .

This is the current use of the term; in the past it was sometimes used differently, as detailed below.

=== Historical use ===
Historically there was some confusion and controversy over whether the notion of integral quadratic form should mean:
; &quot;twos in&quot; : the quadratic form associated to a symmetric matrix with integer coefficients
; &quot;twos out&quot; : a polynomial with integer coefficients (so the associated symmetric matrix may have half-integer coefficients off the diagonal)
This debate was due to the confusion of quadratic forms (represented by polynomials) and symmetric bilinear forms (represented by matrices), and &quot;twos out&quot; is now the accepted convention; &quot;twos in&quot; is instead the theory of integral symmetric bilinear forms (integral symmetric matrices).

In &quot;twos in&quot;, binary quadratic forms are of the form , represented by the symmetric matrix

This is the convention Gauss uses in &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae&quot;.

In &quot;twos out&quot;, binary quadratic forms are of the form , represented by the symmetric matrix
formula_27

Several points of view mean that &quot;twos out&quot; has been adopted as the standard convention. Those include:
* better understanding of the 2-adic theory of quadratic forms, the &#x27;local&#x27; source of the difficulty;
* the lattice point of view, which was generally adopted by the experts in the arithmetic of quadratic forms during the 1950s;
* the actual needs for integral quadratic form theory in topology for intersection theory;
* the Lie group and algebraic group aspects.

=== Universal quadratic forms ===
An integral quadratic form whose image consists of all the positive integers is sometimes called &quot;universal&quot;. Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem shows that is universal. Ramanujan generalized this and found 54 multisets that can each generate all positive integers, namely,

There are also forms whose image consists of all but one of the positive integers. For example, has 15 as the exception. Recently, the 15 and 290 theorems have completely characterized universal integral quadratic forms: if all coefficients are integers, then it represents all positive integers if and only if it represents all integers up through 290; if it has an integral matrix, it represents all positive integers if and only if it represents all integers up through 15.

<text>Arthur Lowe (22 September 1915 – 15 April 1982) was an English actor. His acting career spanned 37 years, including starring roles in numerous theatre and television productions. He played Captain Mainwaring in the British sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; from 1968 until 1977, was nominated for seven BAFTAs and became one of the most recognised faces on UK television. He won his only BAFTA, the Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, for his performance in &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973).

Lowe began acting professionally in England in 1945, after army service in the Second World War. He worked in theatre, film and television throughout the 1950s but it was not until he landed the part of Leonard Swindley in the television soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot; in 1960 that he came to national attention. He played the character until 1965, while continuing theatre and other acting work. 

In 1968, he took on his role in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft. The profile he gained from the role led to further character roles. Despite increasingly poor health in his final years, he maintained a busy professional schedule until his death from a stroke on 15 April 1982, aged 66.

==Early life==
Lowe was born on 22 September 1915 in Hayfield, Derbyshire, the only child of Arthur Lowe and his wife, Nan ( Mary Annie Ford). Lowe&#x27;s father, a tall man known as &quot;Big Arthur&quot;, worked for the Great Central Railway, which was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. In 1916, Big Arthur took up a job as clerk at London Road Station, Manchester, shortly before being called up for First World War service. The family rented a house in Hemmons Road, in the Manchester suburb of Levenshulme, where Little Arthur (as he was known) attended Chapel Street School. From about 1927 he went to Alma Park School, where one of his first stage performances was in a school production of &quot;The Grand Cham&#x27;s Diamond&quot; in December 1929.

Lowe&#x27;s intention to join the Merchant Navy was thwarted by his poor eyesight. His first job after leaving school was as a barrow boy for the Manchester branch of motor accessory company Brown Brothers. After progressing to the role of clerk within the firm he took up a job at the aircraft factory of the Fairey Aviation Company in 1936. He described his job of progress chaser as &quot;a sort of time and motion man chivvying the fellows along and seeing that they produced a certain amount of work each day&quot;. He also had to check that the parts for building the planes were where they needed to be on the production line.

==War service==
In February 1939, Lowe joined the Territorial Army, which meant several months later he was among the first men called up to serve in the Second World War. He served with the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry. Initially training with horses, the regiment soon became a mechanised unit of the Royal Artillery. Lowe was medically regraded due to his poor eyesight and after training in wireless and as a radar technician transferred to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps. After working on searchlights in Lincolnshire he was sent out to Egypt in 1942, where he soon transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He was a good horseman and learned to speak Arabic. After a period in the Suez Canal Zone he was stationed at the REME&#x27;s 15th Radio Repair Workshops at Rafah.

Lowe soon found outlets for developing his talents in entertainment. He was known among the troopers for his impressions of officers and crooners, and when radio equipment was stolen, he read the BBC News over his camp&#x27;s PA system. In January 1943 he called a meeting to form an amateur dramatics group, the REME No. 1 Welfare Club Dramatic Society. &quot;It was sheer bloody boredom that did it&quot;, he said later, &quot;and after that I was hooked&quot;. He took his first appearance on stage in &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; on 8 February 1943 and continued both to organise and act in plays, as well as a Christmas revue. His efforts led to a posting with the No. 2 Field Entertainment Unit, promoted to the rank of sergeant major. In this role he helped outlying units to produce their own shows. He assisted Martin Benson in establishing the Mercury Theatre in Alexandria, including in production and management, but not as an actor.

Following the end of the war, Lowe returned to Britain in November 1945, although he was not officially demobbed until March 1946.

==Acting career==
===Early career===
In 1945, Lowe&#x27;s father was organising special railway trips and excursions, including private trains for circuses and theatre companies. He arranged an audition for Lowe with Eric Norman for the Frank H. Fortescue Famous Players repertory company. Lowe was immediately offered a trial in the comedy play &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, in which he took the part of Dickson. In this role he made his professional acting debut at the Manchester Repertory Theatre on 17 December 1945. He was paid £5 per week for twice-nightly performances. In eight months with Fortescue&#x27;s he appeared in 33 plays and gave 396 performances.

During this time Lowe began a romantic relationship with Joan Cooper (1922–1989), a married actress in the company whose husband also began an affair at about the same time. Arthur and Joan were engaged in June 1946 and lived together from August. After Joan&#x27;s divorce came through they married at a registry office in Robert Adam Street, The Strand, London, on 10 January 1948. Joan had a son, David Gatehouse, from her first marriage. Another son, Stephen Lowe, was born on 23 January 1953. The couple remained together until Lowe&#x27;s death.

Lowe worked with repertory companies around the country. After a year at the County Theatre, Hereford, 1946–1947, he moved to London in 1948 and for the next three years mostly worked in South London theatres. An early brief film role was as a reporter for the &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; magazine, near the end of the Ealing Studios dark comedy classic &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot; (1949). His first West End role came in 1950, as Wilson the butler in Guy Bolton&#x27;s &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;. Lowe became known for his character roles, which in 1952 included a breakthrough part as Senator Brockbank in the musical &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; at the London Coliseum. Other roles in musicals included a part in the 1954 London revival of &quot;Pal Joey&quot; and eighteen months as the salesman in the first West End production of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, from 1955 to 1957. His name first appeared in lights in 1957, at the Piccadilly Theatre, with the part of Bert Vokes in the murder melodrama &quot;A Dead Secret&quot;. This also brought his first West End reviews.

Lowe first appeared on television in 1951, in an episode of the BBC series &quot;I Made News&quot;. He would work in television every year afterwards, until his death. 1950s roles included various minor parts in dramas, including the crime series &quot;Murder Bag&quot;. He played the role of the gunsmith in &quot;Leave It to Todhunter&quot; (1958), appeared in the comedy series &quot;Time Out for Peggy&quot;, and played a fussy, nervous character in an episode of &quot;Dial 999&quot;. His first regular television part was as ship steward Sydney Barker in the ABC-TV series &quot;All Aboard&quot; (1958–1959).

In 1960 Lowe took up a regular role as draper and lay preacher Leonard Swindley in the northern soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, in which he appeared until 1965. He negotiated a contract through which he only had to work six months of the year, three months on and three months off. During the months he was not playing Swindley, he remained busy on stage or making one-off guest appearances in other TV series such as &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1967) (episode entitled &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Treasure&quot;). His most acclaimed stage roles during this period included pompous north-country alderman Michael Oglethorpe in Henry Livings&#x27;s &quot;Stop It, Whoever You Are&quot; at the Arts Theatre (1961), and Sir Davey Dunce in &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Fortune&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre (1966).

Lowe did not relish work on &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and was happy to give it up, but viewer responses to his character led to him reprising Swindley for starring roles in the spin-off series &quot;Pardon the Expression&quot; (1966) and its sequel &quot;Turn Out the Lights&quot; (1967).

===Stardom===
In 1968, Lowe was cast in his best remembered role, as Home Guard platoon leader Captain Mainwaring in the BBC sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1968–1977). Some colleagues on the show later remarked that the role resembled him: pompous and bumbling. Frank Williams said he felt this perception was unfair: &quot;He certainly didn&#x27;t suffer fools gladly and always knew his own mind, but he also had an ability to laugh at himself. Personally, I found him to be a most kind and generous man&quot;. David Croft said Lowe had to be treated with kid gloves. He had firm ideas on what he was willing to do and never took his script home, which resulted in uncertainty over his lines. He could be pompous and over time his part was written so there was a blurring of the line between actor and character. An oddity of his contract was that he would never have to remove his trousers.

Lowe held conservative political views and disapproved of the left-wing politics of his co-star Clive Dunn. Dunn, in turn, described some of Lowe&#x27;s opinions as outrageous, but as an actor rated him &quot;ten out of ten in his field&quot;. Despite some tensions, Jimmy Perry described the cast as a &quot;marvellous bunch of pros&quot; with &quot;no sort of volatile animosity between anybody&quot;.

Lowe also played Mainwaring in a radio version of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, a stage play and a feature-length film released in 1971. He played Mainwaring&#x27;s drunken brother Barry Mainwaring, in the series&#x27; 1975 Christmas episode &quot;My Brother and I&quot;.

While &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was not in production, Lowe&#x27;s work continued to include stage roles. In 1968, he was invited by Sir Laurence Olivier to join the National Theatre at the Old Vic, to play divorce solicitor A.B. Raham in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Home and Beauty&quot;. He returned to the company in 1974 to play Stephano in Peter Hall&#x27;s production of &quot;The Tempest&quot;, starring Sir John Gielgud. In the same year he appeared as Ben Jonson alongside Gielgud&#x27;s Shakespeare in Edward Bond&#x27;s &quot;Bingo&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre.

Lowe also had prominent parts in several films directed by Lindsay Anderson, including &quot;if...&quot; (1968) and &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973), for which he won a BAFTA for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. His other film parts during this period included Spike Milligan&#x27;s surreal &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot; (1969), in which he mutates into a parrot. He played a drunken butler in &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; (1972) with Peter O&#x27;Toole, and theatre critic Horace Sprout in the horror film &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973), in which the character is murdered by a deranged actor played by Vincent Price.

On television, Lowe appeared twice as a guest performer on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; (1971 and 1977), alongside Richard Briers in a series of Ben Travers farces for the BBC, as the pompous Dr Maxwell in the ITV comedy &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; (1971) and as Redvers Bodkin, a snooty, old-fashioned butler, in the short-lived sitcom &quot;The Last of the Baskets&quot; (1971–72). Between 1971 and 1973 Lowe joined &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; colleague Ian Lavender, on the BBC radio comedy &quot;Parsley Sidings&quot; and he played Mr Micawber in a BBC television serial of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1974). He employed a multitude of voices on the BBC animated television series &quot;Mr. Men&quot; (1974), in which he was the narrator.

In 1972, Lowe also recorded the novelty songs &quot;How I Won The War&quot; and &quot;My Little Girl, My Little Boy&quot;.

While touring at coastal theatres with his wife, Lowe used his 1885 former steam yacht &quot;Amazon&quot; as a floating base. He bought &quot;Amazon&quot; as a houseboat in 1968, but realised her potential and took her back to sea in 1971; this vessel is still operating in the Mediterranean. The ship had a bar with a semicircular notch cut halfway along, to enable both the portly figure of Lowe and his wife to serve behind the bar at the same time, acting as hosts during the parties they threw on board.

In an interview for a &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; retrospective on BBC television in 2010, Clive Dunn described him sitting at the bar in the evenings when they were filming on location, consuming a drink which Lowe named &#x27;Amazon&#x27; after his yacht. Dunn described the drink as comprising &quot;gin and ginger ale, with a single slice of cucumber&quot;.

Lowe seldom made public political statements, but his face appeared on posters and other advertising in support of the &quot;Voting Yes&quot; campaign for the 1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum. He also appeared at a Conservative Party fundraising bazaar in Edward Heath&#x27;s constituency.

===Declining health and later career===
By the mid-1970s Lowe suffered from narcolepsy, which caused him to fall asleep during rehearsals, performances, and at other unintended times – sometimes in the middle of a sentence. Stephen Lowe said that although he was often mistaken for drunk, he very rarely was. While both biographies of Lowe acknowledge his high consumption of alcohol, neither claim it extended to alcoholism. Lowe was also unfit, a smoker, and increasingly overweight. In 1979, he suffered a mild stroke. Despite his generally declining health, including worsening narcolepsy, he maintained a busy professional life; Derek Benfield described him as a workaholic.

When &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; ended in 1977, Lowe remained in demand, taking starring roles in television comedies such as &quot;Bless Me, Father&quot; (1978–1981), as the mischievous Catholic priest Father Charles Clement Duddleswell and in &quot;Potter&quot; (1979–80) as the busybody Redvers Potter. In 1980 he toured Australia and New Zealand with a production of Derek Benfield&#x27;s play &quot;Beyond a Joke&quot;. Around this time Lowe was making many television commercials, with no fewer than nineteen in 1981 alone.

His later stage career mainly involved touring the English provinces with his wife. He seldom took on a stage play unless it included a role for Joan and this saw some opportunities fall through. Lowe&#x27;s agent Peter Campbell said the last ten years of his theatre career were &quot;blown&quot; by this condition, and Stephen Lowe thought his mother placed unreasonable pressure on his father to find her roles. Frank Williams said the couple shared a great love story, and if the arrangement held Lowe back it was only because he chose to be held back. Ian Lavender thought Lowe&#x27;s narcolepsy led him to pull back from his range and choose safer roles.

In 1981 Lowe reprised his role as Captain Mainwaring for the pilot episode of &quot;It Sticks Out Half a Mile&quot;, a radio sequel to &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. At Christmas that year he and Joan appeared in the pantomime &quot;Mother Goose&quot; at Victoria Palace, London. In January 1982, Richard Burton had his private aeroplane fly Lowe to Venice to film a cameo role in the television miniseries &quot;Wagner&quot;.

===Death and last released works===
On 14 April 1982, Lowe gave a live televised interview on &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;. At just after 6 pm the same day, he collapsed from the onset of a stroke in his dressing room at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham. This was before a performance of &quot;Home at Seven&quot; in which he was due to appear with his wife, Joan. He was taken, unconscious, to Birmingham General Hospital, where he died at about 5 am, at the age of 66. 

Lowe was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Sutton Coldfield Crematorium, following a small funeral of which few people were notified and fewer than a dozen attended. Joan did not attend, as she refused to miss a performance of &quot;Home at Seven&quot; and was appearing in Belfast at the time. According to her friend Phyllis Bateman, the couple had a pact that neither would go to the other&#x27;s funeral. Stephen said his parents were not sentimental or religious and Joan&#x27;s coping mechanism was summed up in the adage, &quot;the show must go on&quot;. A memorial service was held on 24 May 1982 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, attended by Lowe&#x27;s wife and family, former colleagues and many friends.

Lowe&#x27;s final film and television performances premiered after his death. His last feature film was Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982). In his final sitcom, (1982), he starred as a boys&#x27; preparatory school master. &quot;Wagner&quot; was Lowe&#x27;s last screen role, released in December 1983.

==Recognition==
Tom Cole wrote in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;: &quot;There are few actors who charmed viewers both young and old with such ease, and fewer still who could be trusted with the task of bringing classic literary characters like Charles Pooter and A.J. Wentworth to life.&quot; Graham Lord wrote, in his 2002 biography, that &quot;almost every actor who worked with Arthur considered him to be outstanding&quot;. He gave as an exception Martin Benson, who said Lowe did not have a lot of vocal skill in his rep days, &quot;and I don&#x27;t think he had afterwards either...A lot of his success came from this oddball personality that he had and the fact that later in his career he had some very good writers.&quot;

In 2002, Paul Scofield described Lowe as a rare talent and &quot;seriously brilliant actor&quot;, and said it was his timing that set him apart. Jimmy Perry agreed about his timing: &quot;It was faultless. He could get huge laughs with such simple lines as &#x27;Just a moment,&#x27; &#x27;how dare you,&#x27; and &#x27;you stupid boy&#x27;&quot; – all catchphrases from &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Perry also described Lowe as a kind man who went out of his way to help actors less fortunate than himself.

==Approach to acting==
In the 1970s, Lowe said he had “simply wanted to be the best character actor going” and it was only television that brought him stardom. Of his preferred style of comic acting he said: “Anybody could get a laugh if they pissed into the pit. But it wouldn’t be the right laugh.” He claimed to treat every comic part as a straight part, saying: “The more seriously you play the part, the funnier it is. You see, people are only funny to other people, never to themselves.”

==Biographies==
Two biographies of Arthur Lowe have been published: &quot;Arthur Lowe – Dad&#x27;s Memory&quot; by his son Stephen, in 1997; and &quot;Arthur Lowe&quot; by Graham Lord in 2002. In 2000, &quot;The Unforgettable Arthur Lowe&quot; was part of &quot;The Unforgettable&quot; series of TV biographies of comedy performers.

==Memorials==
In December 2007 plans were announced for a statue of Lowe to be erected in Thetford, Norfolk, where the outside scenes for &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; were filmed. Series co-writer David Croft unveiled the statue on 19 June 2010. It depicts Lowe in the character of Captain Mainwaring, sitting upright on a simple bench in Home Guard uniform, with his swagger stick across his knees.
The star has also had two blue plaques unveiled, one at Maida Vale and one at his birthplace in Hayfield, Derbyshire.

==Portrayals==
Robert Daws portrayed Lowe in the BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;Dear Arthur, Love John&quot; by Roy Smiles, first broadcast in 2012. The play charts the relationship between Lowe and John Le Mesurier. John Sessions played him in the 2015 television movie &quot;We&#x27;re Doomed! The Dad&#x27;s Army Story&quot;.

<doc id="251482" wikidata="Q216811" url="?curid=251482" title="John Venn">
<text>John Venn, FRS, FSA (4 August 1834 – 4 April 1923) was an English mathematician, logician and philosopher noted for introducing Venn diagrams, which are used in logic, set theory, probability, statistics, and computer science. In 1866, Venn published &quot;The Logic of Chance&quot;, a groundbreaking book which espoused the frequency theory of probability, arguing that probability should be determined by how often something is forecast to occur as opposed to &quot;educated&quot; assumptions. Venn then further developed George Boole&#x27;s theories in the 1881 work &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot;, where he highlighted what would become known as Venn diagrams.

== Early life ==
John Venn was born on 4 August 1834 in Kingston upon Hull, Yorkshire, to Martha Sykes and Rev. Henry Venn, who was the rector of the parish of Drypool. His mother died when he was three years old. Venn was descended from a long line of church evangelicals, including his grandfather John Venn. Venn was brought up in a very strict atmosphere at home. His father Henry had played a significant part in the Evangelical movement and he was also the secretary of the Society for Missions to Africa and the East, establishing eight bishoprics overseas. His grandfather was pastor to William Wilberforce of the abolitionist movement, in Clapham.

He began his education in London joining Sir Roger Cholmeley&#x27;s School, now known as Highgate School, with his brother Henry in September 1846. He moved on to Islington Proprietary School.

== University life and career ==
In October 1853, he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He found the Mathematical Tripos unsuited to his mathematical style, complaining that the handful of private tutors he worked with &quot;always had the Tripos prominently in view&quot;. In contrast, Venn wished to investigate interesting ideas beyond the syllabus. Nonetheless, he was Sixth Wrangler upon sitting the exams in January 1857.

Venn experienced, in his words, a &quot;reaction and disgust&quot; to the Tripos which led him to sell his books on mathematics and state that he would never return to the subject. Following his family vocation, he was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1859, serving first at the church in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and later in Mortlake, Surrey.

In 1862, he returned to Cambridge as a lecturer in moral science, studying and teaching political economy, philosophy, probability theory and logic. He reacquainted himself with logic and became a leading scholar in the field through his textbooks &quot;The Logic of Chance&quot; (1866), &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (1881) and &quot;The Principles of Empirical or Inductive Logic&quot; (1889). His academic writing was influenced by his teaching: he saw Venn diagrams, which he called &quot;Eulerian Circles&quot; and introduced in 1880, as a pedagogical tool. Venn was known for teaching students across multiple Cambridge colleges, which was rare at the time.

In 1883, he resigned from the clergy, having concluded that Anglicanism was incompatible with his philosophical beliefs.

In 1903 he was elected President of the college, a post he held until his death.

With his son, Venn developed a bowling machine that was able to impart spin to a cricket ball. When members of the Australian cricket team visited Cambridge in June 1909, Venn’s machine bowled Victor Trumper, one of their star batsmen. The machine was recreated in 2024 by the university engineering department.

In 1883, Venn was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1884, he was awarded a Sc.D. by Cambridge.

He died on 4 April 1923.

== Civic and personal life ==
In 1868, Venn married Susanna Carnegie Edmonstone with whom he had one son, John Archibald Venn. His son entered the mathematics field as well and became Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University.

Venn was an active member of civic society in Cambridge. He was a committee member of the Cambridge Charitable Organisations Society, elected vice-chairman in December 1884. Venn was president of the Cambridge Antiquarian Society in 1908–1909. He is also listed as a vice president of the Cambridge Provident Medical Institution.

Venn was a supporter of votes for women. He co-signed with his wife Susanna, a letter to the &quot;Cambridge Independent Press&quot;, published 16 October 1908, encouraging women to put themselves forward as candidates for the Cambridge Town Council elections. The letter was co-sponsored by Maud Darwin and Florence Ada Keynes.

Venn was also a gardener, regularly taking part in local competitions organised by groups such as the Cambridgeshire Horticultural Society, winning prizes for his roses in July 1885 and for his white carrots later that September.

== Memorials ==
* In 2017 the Drypool Bridge in Hull was decorated with intersecting circles, in honour of Venn and an unofficial &#x27;blue plaque&#x27; is installed near the same location on Clarence Street.
* Venn is commemorated at the University of Hull by the Venn Building. 
* A stained glass window in the dining hall of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, commemorates Venn&#x27;s work.
* Venn Street in Clapham, London, which was the home of his grandfather, shows a Venn diagram on the street sign.

== Publications ==
Venn compiled &quot;Alumni Cantabrigienses&quot;, a biographical register of former members of the University of Cambridge. It was edited by Venn and his son John Archibald Venn and published by Cambridge University Press in ten volumes between 1922 and 1953. 

His other works include:

<doc id="251484" wikidata="Q1130204" url="?curid=251484" title="Coloureds">
<text>Coloureds () are multiracial people in South Africa, Namibia and to a lesser extent, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Their ancestry descends from the interracial marriages/interracial unions that occurred between Europeans, Africans and Asians. Interracial mixing in South Africa began in the 17th century in the Dutch Cape Colony where the Dutch men mixed with Khoi Khoi women, Bantu women and Asian female slaves, producing mixed race children. Eventually, interracial mixing occurred throughout South Africa and the rest of Southern Africa with various other European nationals such as the Portuguese, British, Germans, and Irish, who mixed with other African tribes which contributed to the growing number of mixed-race people, who would later be officially classified as Coloured by the apartheid government.

&quot;Coloured&quot; was a legally defined racial classification during apartheid referring to anyone not white or of the black Bantu tribes, which effectively largely meant people of colour.

The majority of coloureds are found in the Western Cape, but are prevalent throughout the country. According to the 2022 South African census, Coloureds represent 8.15% of people within South Africa, while they make up 42.1% of the population in the Western Cape and 41.6% in the Northern Cape, representing a plurality of the population in these two provinces of South Africa. In the Western Cape, a distinctive Cape Coloured and affiliated Cape Malay culture developed. Genetic studies suggest the group has the highest levels of mixed ancestry in the world.

The apartheid-era Population Registration Act, 1950 and subsequent amendments, codified the Coloured identity and defined its subgroups, including Cape Coloureds and Malays. Indian South Africans were initially classified under the act as a subgroup of Coloured. As a consequence of Apartheid policies and despite the abolition of the Population Registration Act in 1991, Coloureds are regarded as one of four race groups in South Africa. These groups (blacks, whites, Coloureds and Indians) still tend to have strong racial identities and to classify themselves and others as members of these race groups. The classification continues to persist in government policy, to an extent, as a result of attempts at redress such as Black Economic Empowerment and Employment Equity.

==Ancestral Background==
===South Africa===
South Africa is known as a &#x27;Rainbow nation&#x27; because of its diverse cultures, tribes, races, religions and nationalities. As a result of this diversity, Coloured people in South Africa have different ancestries as they come from different regions in the country that have different ethnic groups.

====Dutch Cape Colony/Cape Colony/Cape Province====

The first and the largest phase of interracial marriages/Miscegenation in South Africa happened in the Dutch Cape Colony and the rest of the Cape Colony, which began from the 17th century, shortly after the arrival of Dutch settlers, who were led by Jan van Riebeeck. When the Dutch settled in the Cape in 1652, they met the Khoi Khoi who were the natives of the area. After settling in the Cape, the Dutch established farms that required intensive labour, therefore, they enforced slavery in the Cape. Some of the Khoi Khoi became labourers in the Cape. Despite this, there was resistance by the Khoi Khoi, which led to the Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars. As a result of this resistance, the Dutch imported slaves from other parts of the world, especially the Malay people from present-day Indonesia and the Bantu people from various parts of Southern Africa. To a smaller extent, slaves were also imported from Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Madagascar, Mauritius and elsewhere in Africa. The slaves were almost invariably given Christian names but their places of origin were indicated in the records of sales and other documents so that it is possible to estimate the ratio of slaves from different regions. Often, slaves were given their masters&#x27; surnames, surnames that were of biblical origin (e.g. Adams, Thomas, Jacobs, Matthews, Peters, Daniels) or surnames that reflected the month in which they arrived (e.g. September, March, October, April). These slaves were, however, dispersed and lost their cultural identity over the course of time.

Because most of the Dutch settlers in the Cape were men, many of them married and fathered the first group of mixed-race children with Khoi Khoi women. Soon after the arrival of slaves in the Cape, the Dutch men also married and fathered mixed race children with the Malay from Indonesia, the Southern African Bantu, Indians and other enslaved ethnic groups in the Cape. To a certain extent, the slaves in the Cape also had interracial unions with each other and mixed-race children were also conceived from these unions as well because the slaves were of different races (African and Asian). Unlike the One-drop rule in the USA, mixed-race children in the Cape were not viewed as &quot;white enough to be white&quot;, &quot;black enough to be black&quot; nor &quot;asian enough to be asian&quot;, therefore, mixed race children from all these interracial unions in the Cape grew up and married amongst themselves, forming their own community that would later be known as the &quot;Cape Coloured&quot;.

The first interracial marriage in the Cape was between Krotoa (a Khoi Khoi woman who was a servant, a translator and a crucial negotiator between the Dutch and the Khoi Khoi. Her Dutch name was &quot;Eva Van Meerhof&quot;) and Peter Havgard (a Danish surgeon whom the Dutch renamed as &quot;Pieter Van Meerhof&quot;). Having conceived 3 mixed-race children, Krotoa was known as the mother that gave birth to the Coloured community in South Africa.

Eventually, more Dutch people settled in the Cape, amongst them were the Van Wijk family (whose descendants became &#x27;Van Wyk&#x27;) who arrived in the Cape in 1686 and the Erasmus family that arrived in 1689. The Huguenots (also known as &#x27;French Huguenots&#x27;) were French Protestants who escaped from the banishment and persecution of Protestants in France and many of them immigrated to the Dutch Cape Colony to seek refuge amongst the existing Dutch community during the late 1600s and early 1700s. Coming from a country that has a rich history of wine production, these French refugees pioneered the vineyards of the Cape Winelands, turning it into one of the biggest wine producers in the world. Although many Huguenots who arrived in the Cape were already married, their children and descendants soon integrated with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Dutch Cape Colony and after a few generations, they spoke Dutch, not French. Due to integration with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Cape, there are many Afrikaans surnames of French origin e.g. Le Roux, De Villiers, Joubert, Marais, Visagie, Du Plessis, Pienaar, De Klerk(from &#x27;Le Clerc&#x27;), Meyer, Fourie, Theron, Cronje, Viljoen (from &#x27;Villion&#x27;), Du Toit, Reyneke, Malan, Naude, De Lille, Fouche, Blignaut, Retief, Boshoff, Rossouw, and Louw.

During the 1600s and the 1700s, Germany was the Netherlands&#x27; biggest trading partner in Europe and due to their good relations, hundreds of thousands of Germans were recruited by the VOC making Germans the largest foreign Europeans in the Dutch empire. Throughout the Dutch rule, the VOC sent nearly 15 000 Germans to the Dutch Cape Colony to work as officials, sailors, administrators and soldiers. The Germans learnt Dutch and it replaced German. Eventually, Germans in the Cape became farmers, teachers, traders and ministers. Almost all Germans who settled in the Cape throughout the Dutch rule were men and therefore, almost all German men in the Cape married women outside their culture (especially African and Asian women). Due to integration with the Dutch and other ethnic groups in the Cape, there are many Afrikaans surnames of German origin e.g. Botha, Hartzenberg, Grobler, Pretorius, Booysen, Steenkamp, Kruger (from &#x27;Krüger&#x27;), Venter, Cloete, Schoeman, Mulder, Kriel, Breytenbach, Engelbrecht, Potgieter, Maritz, Liebenberg, Fleischman, Weimers, and Schuster. Some few Portuguese people also settled in the Cape and were integrated into the community which is how the Portuguese surname &#x27;Ferreira&#x27; ended up being an Afrikaans surname as well.

With the arrival of more Europeans (as mentioned above), more African and Asian slaves and the recruitment of more Khoi Khoi labourers in the Cape Colony, there were more interracial unions with more mixed-race children who were absorbed into the Cape Coloured community. The recruitment of Khoi Khoi labourers and the importation of African and Asian slaves continued until the Cape fell under British rule in the early 1800s and eventually, these slaves and labourers were absorbed into the Cape Coloured communtiy. The predominant Asian slaves in the Cape were the Malays who came from Indonesia while some also came from Malaysia. Because Indonesia and Malaysia are both predominantly muslim-states, the slaves who were taken from the 2 countries were the ones who introduced Islam in the Dutch Cape Colony. Many Malays were also sent to the Dutch Cape Colony as exiled prisoners who ended up as slaves as a punishment for rebelling against Dutch rule in Indonesia(which was then called the Dutch East Indies). Although most Malays in the Cape were interracially absorbed into the Cape Coloured community, a small minority of them preserved their own community and culture, therefore, they became known as the Cape Malay. Eventually, other muslims(especially Indian slaves and merchants from the Middle East and North Africa) were absorbed into the Cape Malay community. However, during the Apartheid regime, the Cape Malays were classified as a sub-group of the Coloured due to similar ancestry with the Cape Coloured and because South Africa&#x27;s population was grouped into four races under the Population Registration Act, 1950: Black, White, Coloured and Indian. Therefore, many Cape Malays were forced to live in Coloured communities during Apartheid.
During the 17th century (in this case, from 1652-1700), the Dutch Cape Colony consisted only of present-day Cape Town with its surrounding areas such as Paarl, Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. However, from the 18th century until the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the territory of the Cape expanded gradually to the north and east. The expansion of the Dutch Cape Colony was mainly caused by the dry and infertile nature of its immediate interior, therefore farmers needed fertile land because farms could only be settled where there were springs to provide permanent water. However, it was also influenced by emigration of the Trekboers who left the Cape and migrated into the Karoo during the 18th century and after British annexation of the Cape in the 19th century. By the mid-18th century, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached present-day Swellendam and by the end of the Dutch rule (after British annexation in 1814), the territory of the Cape had already reached certain parts of the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape, leading to the arrival of the Afrikaner/Boer with their multiracial slaves in different parts of the Cape. With the gradual expansion of the Cape, the migration of the trekboer, the arrival of the Afrikaner/Boer with their multiracial slaves and the additional arrival of various European nationalities( such as the British, Irish etc.), there were more interracial unions throughout the Cape; this time between the white and the Khoisans in the Northern Cape and between the white and the Xhosa in the Eastern Cape with more mixed race children being conceived, who also became part of the Cape Coloureds.

Miscegenation in the eastern part of the Cape (which is now the Eastern Cape) dates to the late 1600s which began as a result of the shipwrecks. The Wild Coast Region of the Eastern Cape (which stretches from the provincial border with Natal to East London and Port Alfred) is named after its wilderness and the stormy seas that caused thousands of shipwrecks. Survivors of the shipwrecks (most of whom were Europeans while some were Asians) settled on the Wild Coast. Having no means to return home, most survivors remained permanently in the Eastern Cape and mixed with the Xhosa. Within the same period, many escaped slaves from the Dutch Cape Colony found refuge amongst the Xhosa and assimilated into Xhosa society, and they were soon followed by the Trekboers who were on their way to the Karoo while some of them settled in the Eastern Cape where they mixed with the Xhosa and the Khoi Khoi. The most notorious Trekboer to do so was Coenraad De Buys who fathered many mixed race children with his many African wives (who were Khoi Khoi and Xhosa) and one of them was Chief Ngqika&#x27;s mother, Yese, wife of Mlawu kaRarabe. During the last years of Dutch rule, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached the Western portion of the Eastern Cape, especially in the Graaff-Reinet region which led to the arrival of the Boer/Afrikaner with their multiracial slaves. Miscegenation in the Eastern Cape continued during the 1800s until the early 1900s with the arrival of British, Irish and German settlers, many of whom mixed with the Xhosa and eventually multiracial people in the Eastern Cape also became part of the Cape Coloured.

In the northern region of the Cape (now the Northern Cape), miscegenation began in the 1700s, shortly after the arrival of the Trekboers who left the Dutch Cape Colony (fleeing from autocratic rule) and many settled in the Karoo while some settled in Namaqualand. Some Trekboers even went as far as the Orange River and beyond to the southern part of the Kalahari and in all these regions, they met the Khoisans (the San and the Khoi Khoi). To survive in this hot and dry region, the Trekboers adopted the nomadic lifestyle of the Khoisans and some even mixed with the Khoisans. During the last years of Dutch rule, the territory of the Dutch Cape Colony had reached the southern portion of the Northern Cape, leading to the arrival of the Boers/Afrikaners with their multiracial slaves. In the early 1800s, the Griqua people left the Dutch Cape Colony and migrated to the north of the Karoo where they established Griqualand West. Then the Basters, Oorlams and some Cape Coloureds migrated to the north as well and some of them even reached present-day Namibia. In the latter half of the 1800s, large sums of diamonds, Uranium, Copper and Iron ore were discovered in the Northern Cape which attracted many Europeans, many of whom mixed with the San, Khoi Khoi, Tswana in the northeast and the Xhosa in the southeast and then multiracial people in the Northern Cape also became part of the Cape Coloured.

After British annexation in 1814, slavery was abolished in the Cape in 1834, which lead to the Great Trek when the Boere left the Cape as Voortrekkers and migrated into the interior of South Africa to form the Boer republics. Most of the freed slaves (who became Cape Coloureds) remained behind. Many freed slaves moved to an area in Cape Town that became known as District Six. Throughout the 1800s (especially after the abolishment of slavery in 1834), the Cape received an influx of refugees, immigrants and indentured labourers from Great Britain, Ireland, St Helena, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, India, the Middle East, West Africa, North Africa and East Africa (many of whom were absorbed into the Cape Coloured community).

In the 1800s, the Philippines, at the time a Spanish colony, experienced a harsh rebellion against Spanish colonial rule, so many Filipinos fled. In the late 1830s, the first Filipinos to arrive in Cape Town settled in Kalk Bay where they fished for a living and then Kalk Bay became their new home. When word reached the Philippines, many more Filipinos flocked to Kalk Bay, and they soon scattered throughout Cape Town and its surroundings where they eventually married and were integrated into the Cape Coloured community. Many Filipinos who settled in Cape Town had some Spanish ancestry, so some Cape Coloureds can trace some of their roots to the Philippines and Spain, due to the Filipinos of Kalk Bay. Within the Cape Coloured community, surnames from the Filipinos of Kalk Bay (which are mostly Spanish surnames given to the Filipinos by the Spaniards) are Pascal, Torrez, De La Cruz, Fernandes, Florez, Manuel, and Garcia.

In 1888, Oromo slave children from Ethiopia (who were headed for Arabia) were rescued and freed by British troops. In 1890, the British troops brought these freed Oromo slaves to Lovedale Mission in present-day Eastern Cape where many of them became part of the Cape Coloured. The late Dr Neville Alexander&#x27;s grandmother, Bisho Jarsa, was a freed Oromo slave from Ethiopia.

By the turn of the 20th century, District six became more established and populated. Although its population was predominantly Cape Coloured, District Six (just like many places in the Cape) was diverse with different ethnicities, races and nationalities living there (this includes Blacks, Whites, Jews, Cape Malays and Asian immigrants such as the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese) Many of these groups were absorbed into the Cape coloured community. The Cape region, including the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape, also attracted many European immigrants of various nationalities, including Scandinavians, Portuguese, Greeks, and Italians, many of whom married into the Cape Coloured community while some mixed with other ethnic groups, their children were absorbed into the Cape Coloured community, further diversifying the ancestry of the Cape Coloureds.

As a result, the Cape Coloureds have the most diverse ancestry in the world with a blend of many different ancestries. However, not every Cape Coloured has the same ancestry. At least one genetic study indicates that most Cape Coloureds have ancestries from the following ethnic groups:
* Indigenous Khoisan: ~ 25,3%
* Indigenous Bantu: ~ 15,5%
* Europeans: 39,3%
* Peoples from South and Southeast Asia: 19,9%

It is important to note here that genetic reference cluster term &quot;Khoisan&quot; itself refers to a colonially admixed population cluster, hence the concatenation, and is not a straightforward reference to ancient African pastoralist and hunter ancestry, which is often demarcated by the L0 haplogroup ancestry common in the general South African native population which is also integral part of other aboriginal genetic reference cluster terms like &quot;South-East African Bantu&quot;.

In the 21st century, Coloured people constitute a plurality of the population in the provinces of Western Cape (48.8%), and a large minority in the Northern Cape (40.3%), both areas of centuries of mixing among the populations. In the Eastern Cape, they make up (8.3%) of the population.

====Griqua====

Interracial unions during the 17th and 18th century in the Dutch Cape Colony that were primarily between the West European, especially the Dutch, and the Khoi Khoi created a group of mixed-race individuals that became known as the Griqua. The Griqua people could trace their forefathers to two clans, the Koks and Barendse, the first was made up mainly of Khoikhoi and the second of mixed European descent. Genetic studies made in the 21st century have revealed that the Griquas also had Xhosa, San, and Tswana ancestry. What separates the Griquas from the Cape Coloureds is that the Griquas do not have Asian ancestry within their bloodline and unlike the Cape Coloureds that have adapted the Western and Asian lifestyle, the Griquas clung more to the African lifestyle, most particularly that of the Khoi Khoi.

The actual name &#x27;Griqua&#x27; was derived from the Chariaguriqua people whose princess became the wife of the first Griqua leader, Adam Kok. As a result of discrimination and the smallpox disease that occurred in the Cape Colony, Adam Kok (a Griqua leader who was also a liberated slave) led the Griquas in migrating to other regions in South Africa and formed two Griqua states: Griqualand West and Griqualand East. Griqualand West was located in present-day Northern Cape while Griqualand East was located between present-day KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. Unfortunately, with the expansion of the Cape Colony, which was under British rule this time, the two Griqua states ceased to exist and were annexed into the Cape colony.

During the Apartheid regime (1948-1994), Griquas were classified as Coloureds due to their mixed-race ancestry and they were forced to live in Coloured communities in South Africa under the Group Areas Act. Due to the racial policies and the racial hierarchy of South Africa&#x27;s demographics during Apartheid, many Griquas accepted the classification of &quot;Coloured&quot; for fear that their Griqua roots might place them at a lower level than other groups. As a result, it is difficult to estimate and determine the actual size of the Griqua population, therefore, it remains unknown.

Although Griquas are scattered across the country (due to historic migrations), the majority of Coloureds that come from the Griekwastad area in the Northern Cape, the Kokstad area in KwaZulu-Natal and the Kranshoek area in the Western Cape are either directly Griqua or they are the descendants of Griquas.

====Colony of Natal/Natal province====
Another phase of interracial marriages/miscegenation in South Africa happened in the Colony of Natal (present-day KwaZulu-Natal) during the 19th century and early 20th century. This time, it was mainly between the British and the Zulu with an addition of British intermixing with Indians and the arrival of immigrants from St Helena, and Mauritius that married locally. To a certain extent, miscegenation in Natal also involved the Irish, German, Norwegian and the Xhosa.

Blood group phenotype and gene frequency studies showed that the Natal Coloured population contains a mixture of approximately 40% Black, 30% White and 30% Indian (Asian) genes.

After the Boer republic Natalia was annexed by the British rulers, it became the Natal in 1845. When the British started settling in Natal from the mid-19th century, they established sugarcane plantations especially in the coastal regions (Durban, Stanger etc.) and these plantations required intensive labour as well. Struggling to find labour from the local Zulu, the British decided to import thousands of labourers from India to work on the sugarcane plantations of Natal.

Just like the Dutch settlers in the Cape, most of the British settlers in Natal were men, therefore, many of them married Zulu while some married Indians and mixed-race children were also conceived and eventually, mixed race people in Natal also became &#x27;coloured&#x27;. Sometimes the White administrators who had fathered children from Zulu women would put their mixed-race children in the care of Coloured families in the area. Other times it was the African woman that conceived a mixed-race child from &#x27;Umlungu&#x27; (a white person) that initiated giving up the child. In this way, interracial unions and marriages became common and a separate community grew. The descendants of all these interracial unions remain in Nongoma, Eshowe, Mandeni, Mangete, Nqabeni, Umuziwabantu, and iziNqolwene.

Some of the British men with interracial marriages in Natal practised polygamy, having multiple Zulu wives while others had multiple Zulu concubines. The perfect example of this is John Robert Dunn, a white trader with Scottish parents who became a Zulu chief with 48 Zulu wives and 118 mixed race children; and most of his mixed-race descendants (who became &#x27;Coloureds&#x27; in Natal) still live in present-day KwaZulu-Natal. Another British man who practised polygamy was Henry Fynn who had four Zulu wives and multiple mixed-race children. Although Henry Ogle (a British trader from Yorkshire) married an English wife named Janie and had a son named Henry, he also fathered multiple mixed-race children with his Zulu concubines at his kraal near Umkomaas.

====Apartheid====

During the apartheid era in South Africa of the second half of the 20th century, the government used the term &quot;Coloured&quot; to describe one of the four main racial groups it defined by law (the fourth was &quot;Asian,&quot; later &quot;Indian&quot;). This was an effort to impose white supremacy and maintain racial divisions. Individuals were classified as White South Africans (formally classified as &quot;European&quot;), Black South Africans (formally classified as &quot;Native&quot;, &quot;Bantu&quot; or simply &quot;African&quot; and constituting the majority of the population), Coloureds (mixed-race) and Indians (formally classified as &quot;Asian&quot;). The census in South Africa during 1911 played a significant role in defining racial identities in the country. One of the most noteworthy aspects of this census was the instructions given to enumerators on how to classify individuals into different racial categories. The category of &quot;coloured persons&quot; was used to refer to all people of mixed race, and this category included various ethnic groups such as Hottentots, Bushmen, Cape Malays, Griquas, Korannas, Creoles, Negroes, and Cape Coloureds.

Of particular importance is the fact that the instruction to classify &quot;coloured persons&quot; as a distinct racial group included individuals of African descent, commonly referred to as Negroes. Therefore, it is important to note that Cape Coloureds, as a group of mixed-race individuals, also have African ancestry and can be considered as part of the broader African diaspora.

Although the apartheid government recognised various coloured subgroups, including the Cape Malays and Cape Coloureds, the Coloured population, was for many purposes treated as a single group, despite their varying ancestries and cultures. Also during apartheid, many Griqua began to self-identify as &quot;Coloureds&quot; during the apartheid era, because of the benefits of such classification. For example, Coloureds did not have to carry a &quot;dompas&quot; (a pass, an identity document designed to limit the movements of the black population), while the Griqua, who were seen as an indigenous African group, though heavily mixed, did.

===Zimbabwe===
Zimbabwean Coloureds are descended from Shona or Ndebele, British and Afrikaner settlers, as well as Arab and Asian people.

==History==

===Pre-apartheid era===
Coloured people played an important role in the struggle against apartheid and its predecessor policies. The African Political Organisation, established in 1902, had an exclusively Coloured membership; its leader Abdullah Abdurahman rallied Coloured political efforts for many years. Many Coloured people later joined the African National Congress and the United Democratic Front. Whether in these organisations or others, many Coloured people were active in the fight against apartheid.

The political rights of Coloured people varied by location and over time. In the 19th century they theoretically had similar rights to Whites in the Cape Colony (though income and property qualifications affected them disproportionately). In the Transvaal Republic or the Orange Free State, they had few rights. Coloured members were elected to Cape Town&#x27;s municipal authority (including, for many years, Abdurahman). The establishment of the Union of South Africa gave Coloured people the franchise, although by 1930 they were restricted to electing White representatives. They conducted frequent voting boycotts in protest. Such boycotts may have contributed to the victory of the National Party in 1948. It carried out an apartheid programme that stripped Coloured people of their remaining voting powers.

The term &quot;kaffir&quot; is a racial slur used to refer to Black African people in South Africa. While it is still used against black people, it is not as prevalent as it is against coloured people.

===Apartheid era===

Coloured people were subject to forced relocation. For instance, the government relocated Coloured from the urban Cape Town areas of District Six, which was later bulldozed. Other areas they were forced to leave included Constantia, Claremont, Simon&#x27;s Town. Inhabitants were moved to racially designated sections of the metropolitan area on the Cape Flats. Additionally, under apartheid, Coloured people received education inferior to that of Whites. It was, however, better than that provided to Black South Africans.

J. G. Strijdom, known as &quot;the Lion of the North&quot;, continued the impetus to restrict Coloured rights, in order to entrench the new-won National Party majority. Coloured participation on juries was removed in 1954, and efforts to abolish their participation on the common voters&#x27; roll in the Cape Province escalated drastically; it was accomplished in 1956 by a supermajority amendment to the 1951 Separate Representation of Voters Act, passed by Malan but held back by the judiciary as unconstitutional under the South Africa Act, the Union&#x27;s effective constitution. In order to bypass this safeguard, enforced since 1909 to ensure Coloured political rights in the then-British Cape Colony, Strijdom&#x27;s government passed legislation to expand the number of Senate seats from 48 to 89. All of the additional 41 members hailed from the National Party, increasing its representation in the Senate to 77 in total. The Appellate Division Quorum Bill increased the number of judges necessary for constitutional decisions in the Appeal Court from five to eleven. Strijdom, knowing that he had his two-thirds majority, held a joint sitting of parliament in May 1956. The entrenchment clause regarding the Coloured vote, known as the South Africa Act, were thus eliminated and the Separate Representation of Voters Act passed, now successfully.

Coloureds were placed on a separate voters&#x27; roll from the 1958 election to the House of Assembly and forward. They could elect four Whites to represent them in the House of Assembly. Two Whites would be elected to the Cape Provincial Council and the governor general could appoint one senator. Both blacks and Whites opposed this measure, particularly from the United Party and more liberal opposition. The Torch Commando was prominent, while the Black Sash (White women, uniformly dressed, standing on street corners with placards) also made themselves heard. In this way, the question of the Coloured vote became one of the first measures of the regime&#x27;s unscrupulous nature and flagrant willingness to manipulate its inherited Westminster system. It would remain in power until 1994.

Many Coloureds refused to register for the new voters&#x27; roll and the number of Coloured voters dropped dramatically. In the next election, only 50.2% of them voted. They had no interest in voting for White representatives — an activity which many of them saw as pointless, and only persisted for ten years.

Under the Population Registration Act, as amended, Coloureds were formally classified into various subgroups, including Cape Coloureds, Cape Malays and &quot;other coloured&quot;. A portion of the small Chinese South African community was also classified as a coloured subgroup.

In 1958, the government established the Department of Coloured Affairs, followed in 1959 by the Union for Coloured Affairs. The latter had 27 members and served as an advisory link between the government and the Coloured people.

The 1964 Coloured Persons Representative Council turned out to be a constitutional hitch which never really proceeded. In 1969, the Coloureds elected forty onto the council to supplement the twenty nominated by the government, taking the total number to sixty.

Following the 1983 referendum, in which 66.3% of White voters supported the change, the Constitution was reformed to allow the Coloured and Indian minorities limited participation in separate and subordinate Houses in a tricameral Parliament. This was part of a change in which the Coloured minority was to be allowed limited rights and self-governance in &quot;Coloured areas&quot;, but continuing the policy of denationalising the Black majority and making them involuntary citizens of independent homelands. The internal rationale was that South African whites, more numerous at the time than Coloureds and Indians combined, could bolster its popular support and divide the democratic opposition while maintaining a working majority. The effort largely failed, with the 1980s seeing increased disintegration of civil society and numerous states of emergency, with violence increasing from all racial groups. The separate arrangements were removed by the negotiations which took place from 1990 to hold the first universal election.

===Post-apartheid era===

During the 1994 all-race elections, Coloured people voted heavily for the white National Party, which in its first contest with a non-white majority won 20% of the vote and a majority in the new Western Cape province – much due to Cape Coloured support. The National Party recast itself as the New National Party after De Klerk&#x27;s departure in 1996, partly to attract non-White voters, and grew closer to the ANC. This political alliance, often perplexing to outsiders, has sometimes been explained in terms of the culture and language shared by White and Coloured New National Party members, who both spoke Afrikaans. In addition, both groups opposed affirmative action programmes that might give preference to Black South Africans, and some Coloured people feared giving up older privileges, such as access to municipal jobs, if African National Congress gained leadership in the government. After the absorption of the NNP into the ANC in 2005, Coloured voters have generally drawn to the Democratic Alliance, with some opting for minor parties such as Vryheidsfront and Patricia de Lille&#x27;s Independent Democrats, with lukewarm support for the ANC.

Since the late 20th century, Coloured identity politics have grown in influence. The Western Cape has been a site of the rise of opposition parties, such as the Democratic Alliance (DA). The Western Cape is considered as an area in which this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The Democratic Alliance drew in some former New National Party voters and won considerable Coloured support. The New National Party collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance&#x27;s victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.

Patricia de Lille, who became the mayor of Cape Town in 2011 on the platform of the now-defunct Independent Democrats, does not use the label Coloured but many observers would consider her as Coloured by visible appearance. The Independent Democrats party sought the Coloured vote and gained significant ground in the municipal and local elections in 2006, particularly in districts in the Western Cape with high proportions of Coloured residents. The firebrand Peter Marais (formerly a provincial leader of the New National Party) has sought to portray his New Labour Party as the political voice for Coloured people.

Coloured people supported and were members of the African National Congress before, during and after the apartheid era: notable politicians include Ebrahim Rasool (previously Western Cape premier), Beatrice Marshoff, John Schuurman, Allan Hendrickse and Trevor Manuel, longtime Minister of Finance. The Democratic Alliance won control over the Western Cape during the 2009 National and Provincial Elections and subsequently brokered an alliance with the Independent Democrats.

The ANC has had some success in winning Coloured votes, particularly among labour-affiliated and middle-class Coloured voters. Some Coloureds express distrust of the ANC with the comment, saying that the Coloured were considered &quot;not white enough under apartheid and not black enough under the ANC.&quot;
In the 2004 election, voter apathy was high in historically Coloured areas. The ANC faces the dilemma of having to balance the increasingly nationalistic economic aspirations of its core black African support base, with its ambition to regain control of the Western Cape, which would require support from Coloureds.

==Coloureds in other southern African countries==
The term Coloured is also used in Namibia, to describe persons of mixed race, specifically part Khoisan, and part European. The &quot;Basters&quot; of Namibia constitute a separate ethnic group that are sometimes considered a sub-group of the Coloured population of that country. Under South African rule, the policies and laws of apartheid were extended to what was then called South West Africa. In Namibia, Coloureds were treated by the government in a way comparable to that of South African Coloureds.

In Zimbabwe and to a lesser extent Zambia, the term Coloured or &quot;Goffal&quot; was used to refer to people of mixed race. Most are descended from mixed African and British, or African and Indian, progenitors. Some Coloured families descended from Cape Coloured migrants from South Africa who had children with local women. Under Rhodesia&#x27;s predominantly white government, Coloureds had more privileges than black Africans, including full voting rights, but still faced social discrimination. The term Coloured is also used in Eswatini.

==Culture==
===Lifestyle===
As far as family life, housing, eating habits, clothing and so on are concerned, the Christian Coloureds generally maintain a Western lifestyle. Marriages are strictly monogamous, although extramarital and premarital sexual relationships can occur and are perceived differently from family to family. Among the working and agrarian classes, permanent relationships are often officially ratified only after a while if at all.

The average family size of six does not differ from those of other Western families and, as with the latter, is generally related to socio-economic status. Extended families are common. Coloured children are often expected to refer to any extended relatives as their &quot;auntie&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot; as a formality.

While many affluent families live in large, modern, and sometimes luxurious homes, many urban coloured people rely on state-owned economic and sub-economic housing.

===Cultural aspects===
There are many singing and choir associations as well as orchestras in the Coloured community. The Eoan Group Theatre Company performs opera and ballet in Cape Town. The Kaapse Klopse carnival, held annually on 2 January in Cape Town, and the Cape Malay choir and orchestral performances are an important part of the city&#x27;s holiday season. Kaapse Klopse consists of several competing groups that have been singing and dancing through Cape Town&#x27;s streets on New Year&#x27;s Day earlier this year. Nowadays the drumlines in cheerful, brightly Coloured costumes perform in a stadium. Christmas festivities take place in a sacred atmosphere but are no less vivid, mainly including choirs and orchestras that sing and play Christmas songs in the streets. In the field of performing arts and literature, several Coloureds performed with the CAPAB (Cape Performing Arts Board) ballet and opera company, and the community yielded three major Afrikaans poets the well-known poets, Adam Small, S.V. Petersen, and P.J. Philander. In 1968, the Culture and Recreation Council was established to promote the cultural activities of the Coloured Community.

===Education===
Until 1841 missionary societies provided all the school facilities for Coloured children.

All South African children are expected to attend school from the age of seven to sixteen years, at the minimum.

===Economic activities===

Initially, Coloureds were mainly semi-skilled and unskilled labourers who, as builders, masons, carpenters and painters, made an important contribution to the early construction industry in the Cape. Many were also fishermen and farm workers, and the latter had an important share in the development of the wine, fruit and grain farms in the Western Cape.

The Malays were, and still are, skilled furniture makers, dressmakers and coopers. In recent years, more and more Coloureds have been working in the manufacturing and construction industry. There are still many Coloured fishermen, and most Coloureds in the countryside are farm workers and even farmers. The largest percentage of economically active Coloureds is found in the manufacturing industry. About 35% of the economically active Coloured women are employed in clothing, textile, food and other factories.

Another important field of work is the service sector, while an ever-increasing number of Coloureds operate in administrative, clerical and sales positions. All the more professional and managerial posts are. In order to stimulate the economic development of Coloureds, the Coloured Development Corporation was established in 1962. The corporation provided capital to businessmen, offered training courses and undertook the establishment of shopping centres, factories and the like.

==Distribution==
A majority of those who identify as Coloured live in the Western Cape, where they make up almost half of the province&#x27;s population. In the 2022 South African census the distribution of the group per province was as follows:

==Language==
The majority of Coloureds in South Africa speak Afrikaans as their home language, while a smaller minority of the Coloureds speak English as their home language. Most English-speaking Coloureds live in KwaZulu-Natal (especially in its biggest city, Durban) mainly because of their partial British heritage that is mainly mixed with Zulu and because of the extreme anglicisation of Natal. English-speaking Coloureds are also found in a few other areas in South Africa. Almost all Coloureds from Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi speak English as their home language as well because their heritage and history is similar with the Coloureds of Natal as these countries were also British colonies.

While the history behind the English-speaking Coloureds is straightforward, the history behind the Afrikaans-speaking Coloureds is more complicated because Afrikaans has a more detailed, complex, and controversial history. During the 17th and 18th century in the Dutch Cape colony, Dutch was obviously the official language that had to be spoken by everyone living there. Despite discrimination and slavery, the population of the Cape was extremely diverse with so many different ethnic groups and nationalities that spoke their own languages such as the Dutch settlers, French Huguenots, Germans, Khoi Khoi, Bantu, and Indonesians.

With this diversity in the Cape, most people could not speak Dutch fluently, therefore, they spoke broken Dutch. Eventually, broken Dutch was blended with other languages (Malay, Portuguese, Khoekhoegowab etc.) and new dialects were formed. As a way to break the language barrier between the different groups of people living in the Cape, Creolised Dutch evolved through different dialects throughout many years until a new language was eventually born: Afrikaans. It is because of this mixture that Afrikaans borrowed many words from different languages despite being the daughter language of Dutch. This is why Afrikaans is common in the Western region of South Africa and the reason why most Coloureds speak Afrikaans as their home language. And it is why there are more Afrikaans-speaking Coloureds than the Afrikaans-speaking whites. This is also the reason why the type of Afrikaans that&#x27;s spoken in Cape Town and the rest of the Western Cape by the Cape Coloureds, Cape Malays and Blacks is a bit different than the Afrikaans that is spoken by the Afrikaners in other parts of SA as it is spoken in a dialect called Kaaps with more influence from Malay, Portuguese, Khoekhoe and other languages. Kaaps is viewed as the older dialect of Afrikaans because it was spoken by the slaves of the Cape from the 17th century.

However, not every Afrikaans-speaking coloured has a Dutch/Afrikaner ancestor within their bloodline, nor do they have ancestry from the slaves in the Cape Colony. Some Coloureds (especially those whose forefathers were interracially mixed during the late 19th century and 20th century) have totally different ancestries (other European nationalities mixed with other African tribes) but because they moved to predominantly Afrikaans-speaking communities or they were born and bred in predominantly Afrikaans-speaking communities, they ended up speaking Afrikaans as their home language as well. Afrikaans-speaking coloureds are also found in Namibia, especially in the southern region of the country.
Although it is rare, there are also Coloureds who can speak South African Bantu languages, such as Zulu, and Xhosa and the Khoi Khoi and San languages of southern Africa, such as Khoekhoe and Khoemana. The Coloureds that can speak Khoisan languages mostly live in the Northern Cape.


==Cuisine==

Numerous South African cuisines can be traced back to Coloured people. Bobotie, snoek-based dishes, koe&#x27;sisters, bredies, Malay roti and gatsbies are staple diets of Coloureds and other South Africans as well.

<text>The Battle of Hampton Roads, also referred to as the Battle of the &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Merrimack (actually the CSS Virginia&quot;, having been rebuilt and renamed) or the Battle of Ironclads, was a naval battle during the American Civil War.

The battle was fought over two days, March 8 and 9, 1862, in Hampton Roads, a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers meet the James River just before it flows into Chesapeake Bay by the city of Norfolk. The battle was a part of the effort of the Confederacy to break the Union blockade, which had cut off Virginia&#x27;s largest cities and major industrial centers, Norfolk and Richmond, from international trade. At least one historian has argued that, rather than trying to break the blockade, the Confederacy was simply trying to take complete control of Hampton Roads in order to protect Norfolk and Richmond.

This battle was significant in that it was the first combat between ironclad warships, the and . The Confederate fleet consisted of the ironclad ram &quot;Virginia&quot; (built from remnants of the burned steam frigate , the newest warship of the Union Navy) and several supporting vessels. On the first day of battle, they were opposed by several conventional, wooden-hulled ships of the Union Navy.

On that day, &quot;Virginia&quot; was able to destroy two ships of the Union flotilla, and , and was about to attack a third, , which had run aground. However, the action was halted by darkness and falling tide, so &quot;Virginia&quot; retired to take care of her few wounded—which included her captain, Flag Officer Franklin Buchanan—and repair her minimal battle damage.

Determined to complete the destruction of &quot;Minnesota&quot;, Catesby ap Roger Jones, acting as captain in Buchanan&#x27;s absence, returned the ship to the fray the next morning, March 9. During the night, however, the ironclad &quot;Monitor&quot; had arrived and had taken a position to defend &quot;Minnesota&quot;. When &quot;Virginia&quot; approached, &quot;Monitor&quot; intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for about three hours, with neither able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, &quot;Virginia&quot; returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, and &quot;Monitor&quot; to her station defending &quot;Minnesota&quot;. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.

The battle received worldwide attention, having immediate effects on navies around the world. The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit. Although Britain and France had been engaged in an iron-clad arms race since the 1830s, the Battle of Hampton Roads signaled a new age of naval warfare had arrived for the whole world. A new type of warship, monitor, was produced on the principle of the original. The use of a small number of very heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire in all directions, was first demonstrated by &quot;Monitor&quot; but soon became standard in warships of all types. Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls for the rest of the century.

== Background ==

=== Military situation ===

=== The blockade at Norfolk ===
On April 19, 1861, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities at Charleston Harbor, US President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a blockade of ports in the seceded states. On April 27, after Virginia and North Carolina had also passed ordinances of secession, the blockade was extended to include their ports also. Even before the extension, local troops had seized the Norfolk area and threatened the Gosport Navy Yard in Portsmouth. The commandant there, Captain Charles S. McCauley, though loyal to the Union, was immobilized by advice he received from his subordinate officers, most of whom were in favor of secession. Although he had orders from (Union) Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to move his ships to Northern ports, he refused to act until April 20, when he gave orders to scuttle the ships in the yard and destroy its facilities.

At least nine ships were burned, among them the screw frigate . Once the old frigate was towed away successfully. &quot;Merrimack&quot; burned only to the waterline, however, and her engines were more or less intact. The destruction of the navy yard was mostly ineffective; in particular, the large drydock there was relatively undamaged and soon could be restored. Without firing a shot, the advocates of secession had gained for the South its largest navy yard, as well as the hull and engines of what would be in time its most famous warship. They had also seized more than a thousand heavy guns, plus gun carriages and large quantities of gunpowder.

With Norfolk and its navy yard in Portsmouth, the Confederacy controlled the southern side of Hampton Roads. To prevent Union warships from attacking the yard, the Confederates set up batteries at Sewell&#x27;s Point and Craney Island, at the juncture of the Elizabeth River with the James. (See map.) The Union retained possession of Fort Monroe, at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. They also held a small man-made island known as the Rip Raps, on the far side of the channel opposite Fort Monroe, and on this island they completed another fort, named Fort Wool. With Fort Monroe went control of the lower Peninsula as far as Newport News.

Forts Monroe and Wool gave the Union forces control of the entrance to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed some of its most powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell&#x27;s Point and Craney Island. For most of the first year of the war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.

=== Birth of the ironclads ===
When steam propulsion began to be applied to warships, naval constructors renewed their interest in armor for their vessels. Experiments had been tried with armor during the Crimean War (1853–1856), just prior to the American Civil War, and the British and French navies had each built armored ships and were planning to build others. In 1860 the French Navy commissioned , the world&#x27;s first ocean-going ironclad warship. Great Britain followed a year later with , the world&#x27;s first armor-plated iron-hulled warship. The use of armor remained controversial, however, and the United States Navy was generally reluctant to embrace the new technology.

==== CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; ====

When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the advantages of armor. As he looked upon it, the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea, so they would have to compete by building vessels that individually outclassed those of the Union. Armor would provide the edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. Porter, and William P. Williamson.

When Mallory&#x27;s men searched the South for factories that could build engines to drive the heavy ships that he wanted, they found no place to do it immediately. At the best facility, the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, building engines from scratch would take at least a year. Upon learning this, Williamson suggested taking the engines from the hulk of &quot;Merrimack&quot;, recently raised from the bed of the Elizabeth River. His colleagues promptly accepted his suggestion and expanded it, proposing that the design of their projected ironclad be adapted to the hull. Porter produced the revised plans, which were submitted to Mallory for approval.

On July 11, 1861, the new design was accepted, and work began almost immediately. The burned-out hull was towed into the graving dock that the Union Navy had failed to destroy. During the subsequent conversion process, the plans developed further, incorporating an iron ram fitted to the prow. The re-modeled ship&#x27;s offense, in addition to the ram, consisted of 10 guns: six smooth-bore Dahlgrens, two and two Brooke rifles. Trials showed that these rifles firing solid shot would pierce up to eight inches of armor plating.

The Tredegar Iron works could produce both solid shot and shell, and since it was believed that &quot;Virginia&quot; would face only wooden ships, she was given only the explosive shell. The armor plating, originally meant to be thick, was replaced by double plates, each thick, backed by of iron and pine. The armor was pierced for 14 gunports: four on each broadside, three forward, and three aft. The revisions, together with the usual problems associated with the transportation system of the South, resulted in delays that pushed out the launch date until February 3, 1862, and she was not commissioned until February 17, bearing the name .

==== USS &quot;Monitor&quot; ====

Intelligence that the Confederates were working to develop an ironclad caused consternation for the Union, but Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles waited for Congress to meet to request permission to consider building armored vessels; Congress gave this permission on August 3, 1861. Welles appointed a commission, which became known as the Ironclad Board, of three senior naval officers to choose among the designs that were submitted for consideration. The three men were Captains Joseph Smith, Hiram Paulding, and Commander Charles Henry Davis. The board considered seventeen designs, and chose to support three. The first of the three to be completed, even though she was by far the most radical in design, was Swedish engineer and inventor John Ericsson&#x27;s .

Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot;, which was built at Ericsson&#x27;s yard on the East River in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, incorporated new and striking design features, the most significant of which were her armor and armament. Instead of the large numbers of guns of rather small bore that had characterized warships in the past, Ericsson opted for only two guns of large caliber; he wanted to use guns, but had to settle for Dahlgren guns when the larger size were unavailable. These were mounted in a cylindrical turret, in diameter, high, covered with iron thick. The whole rotated on a central spindle, and was moved by a steam engine that could be controlled by one man. Ericsson was afraid that using the full 30 pounds of black powder to fire the huge cannon would raise the risk of an explosion in the turret. He demanded that a charge of 15 pounds be used to lessen this possibility.

As with &quot;Virginia&quot;, trials found that a full charge would pierce armor plate, a finding that would have affected the outcome of the battle. A serious flaw in the design was the pilot house from which the ship would be , a small structure forward of the turret on the main deck. Its presence meant that the guns could not fire directly forward, and it was isolated from other activities on the ship. Despite the late start and the novelty of construction, &quot;Monitor&quot; was actually completed a few days before her counterpart &quot;Virginia&quot;, but the Confederates activated &quot;Virginia&quot; first.

== Battle ==

=== Command ===

The Confederate chain of command was anomalous. Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones had directed much of the conversion of &quot;Merrimack&quot; to &quot;Virginia&quot;, and he was disappointed when he was not named her captain. Jones was retained aboard &quot;Virginia&quot;, but only as her executive officer. Ordinarily, the ship would have been led by a captain of the Confederate States Navy, to be determined by the rigid seniority system that was in place. Secretary Mallory wanted the aggressive Franklin Buchanan, but at least two other captains had greater seniority and had applied for the post. Mallory evaded the issue by appointing Buchanan, head of the Office of Orders and Detail, flag officer in charge of the defenses of Norfolk and the James River. As such, he could control the movements of &quot;Virginia&quot;. Technically, therefore, the ship went into the battle without a captain.

On the Union side, command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron was held by Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough. He had devised a plan for his frigates to engage &quot;Virginia&quot;, hoping to trap her in their crossfire. In the event, his plan broke down completely when four of the ships ran aground (one of them intentionally) in the confined waters of the roadstead. On the day of battle, Goldsborough was absent with the ships cooperating with the Burnside Expedition in North Carolina. In his absence, leadership fell to his second in command, Captain John Marston of . As &quot;Roanoke&quot; was one of the ships that ran aground, Marston was unable to materially influence the battle, and his participation is often disregarded. Most accounts emphasize the contribution of the captain of &quot;Monitor&quot;, John L. Worden, to the neglect of others. Marston did, however, disregard orders from Secretary of War Gideon Welles to send the &quot;Monitor&quot; back to Washington, D.C., ahead of the battle, ensuring that it would be present to confront the &quot;Merrimack&quot;.

=== March 8: &quot;Virginia&quot; wreaks havoc on wooden Union warships ===
The battle began when the large and unwieldy CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; steamed into Hampton Roads on the morning of March 8, 1862. Captain Buchanan intended to attack as soon as possible. &quot;Virginia&quot; was accompanied from her moorings on the Elizabeth River by and , and was joined at Hampton Roads by the James River Squadron, , , and . When they were passing the Union batteries at Newport News, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was temporarily disabled by a shot in her boiler that killed four of her crew. After repairs, she returned and rejoined the others.

At this time, the Union Navy had five warships in the roadstead, in addition to several support vessels. The sloop-of-war and frigate were anchored in the channel near Newport News. The sail frigate and the steam frigates and were near Fort Monroe, along with the storeship . The latter three got under way as soon as they saw &quot;Virginia&quot; approaching, but all soon ran aground. &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; and &quot;Roanoke&quot; took no further important part in the battle.

&quot;Virginia&quot; headed directly for the Union squadron. The battle opened when Union tug &quot;Zouave&quot; fired on the advancing enemy, and &quot;Beaufort&quot; replied. This preliminary skirmishing had no effect. &quot;Virginia&quot; did not open fire until she was within easy range of &quot;Cumberland&quot;. Return fire from &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Congress&quot; bounced off the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of &quot;Cumberland&quot;″s gunfire lightly damaged &quot;Virginia&quot;.

&quot;Virginia&quot; rammed &quot;Cumberland&quot; below the waterline and she sank rapidly, &quot;gallantly fighting her guns as long as they were above water,&quot; according to Buchanan. She took 121 seamen down with her; those wounded brought the casualty total to nearly 150.

Ramming &quot;Cumberland&quot; nearly resulted in the sinking of &quot;Virginia&quot; as well. &quot;Virginia&quot;″s bow ram got stuck in the enemy ship&#x27;s hull, and as &quot;Cumberland&quot; listed and began to go down, she almost pulled &quot;Virginia&quot; under with her. At the time the vessels were locked, one of &quot;Cumberland&#x27;s&quot; anchors was hanging directly above the foredeck of &quot;Virginia&quot;. Had it come loose, the two ships might have gone down together. &quot;Virginia&quot; broke free, however, her ram breaking off as she backed away.
Buchanan next turned &quot;Virginia&quot; on &quot;Congress&quot;. Seeing what had happened to &quot;Cumberland&quot;, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of &quot;Congress&quot;, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined &quot;Virginia&quot; in the attack on &quot;Congress&quot;. After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged &quot;Congress&quot; surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of &quot;Congress&quot; were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on &quot;Virginia&quot;. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered &quot;Congress&quot; fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. &quot;Congress&quot; caught fire and burned throughout the rest of the day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.

Although she had not suffered anything like the damage she had inflicted, &quot;Virginia&quot; was not completely unscathed. Shots from &quot;Cumberland&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, who stood out into the open top of the Virginia, thinking it was perfectly safe, which led to him having his left thigh pierced by a rifle shot.

Meanwhile, the James River Squadron had turned its attention to &quot;Minnesota&quot;, which had left Fort Monroe to join in the battle and had run aground. After &quot;Virginia&quot; had dealt with the surrender of &quot;Congress&quot;, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her deep draft and the falling tide, however, &quot;Virginia&quot; was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. &quot;Virginia&quot; left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell&#x27;s Point for the night, but had killed 250 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.

The United States Navy&#x27;s greatest defeat (and would remain so until World War II) caused panic in Washington. As Lincoln&#x27;s Cabinet met to discuss the disaster, the frightened Secretary of War Edwin Stanton told the others that &quot;Virginia&quot; might attack East coast cities, and even shell the White House before the meeting ended. Welles assured his colleagues that they were safe as the ship could not traverse the Potomac River. He added that the Union also had an ironclad, and that it was heading to meet &quot;Virginia&quot;.

=== March 9: &quot;Monitor&quot; engages &quot;Virginia&quot; ===
Both sides used the respite to prepare for the next day. &quot;Virginia&quot; put her wounded ashore and underwent temporary repairs. Captain Buchanan was among the wounded, so command on the second day fell to his executive officer, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones. Jones proved to be no less aggressive than the man he replaced. While &quot;Virginia&quot; was being prepared for renewal of the battle, and while &quot;Congress&quot; was still ablaze, &quot;Monitor&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, arrived in Hampton Roads. The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing &quot;Virginia&quot; from threatening Union cities. Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect &quot;Minnesota&quot;, so &quot;Monitor&quot; took up a position near the grounded &quot;Minnesota&quot; and waited. &quot;All on board felt we had a friend that would stand by us in our hour of trial,&quot; wrote Captain Gershom Jacques Van Brunt, &quot;Minnesota&quot;″s commander, in his official report the day after the engagement.

The next morning, at dawn on March 9, 1862, &quot;Virginia&quot; left her anchorage at Sewell&#x27;s Point and moved to attack &quot;Minnesota&quot;, still aground. She was followed by the three ships of the James River Squadron. They found their course blocked, however, by the newly arrived &quot;Monitor&quot;. At first, Jones believed the strange craft—which one Confederate sailor mocked as &quot;a cheese on a raft&quot;—to be a boiler being towed from the &quot;Minnesota&quot;, not realizing the nature of his opponent. Soon, however, it was apparent that he had no choice but to fight her. The first shot of the engagement was fired at &quot;Monitor&quot; by &quot;Virginia&quot;. The shot flew past &quot;Monitor&quot; and struck &quot;Minnesota&quot;, which answered with a broadside; this began what would be a lengthy engagement. &quot;Again, all hands were called to quarters, and when she approached within a mile of us I opened upon her with my stern guns and made a signal to the &quot;Monitor&quot; to attack the enemy,&quot; Van Brunt added.

 After fighting for hours, mostly at close range, neither could overcome the other. The armor of both ships proved adequate. In part, this was because each was handicapped in her offensive capabilities. Buchanan, in &quot;Virginia&quot;, had not expected to fight another armored vessel, so his guns were supplied only with shell rather than armor-piercing shot. &quot;Monitor&quot;″s guns were used with the standard service charge of only of powder, which did not give the projectile sufficient momentum to penetrate her opponent&#x27;s armor. Tests conducted after the battle showed that the Dahlgren guns could be operated safely and efficiently with charges of as much as . However, despite this, as the two ironclads circled each other during the fight, &quot;Monitor&quot; was about to penetrate &quot;Virginia&quot;&#x27;s armor, but a misfiring of its weapons caused it to lose the advantage. At 10 AM that morning, &quot;Virginia&quot; grounded. &quot;Monitor&quot; opened fire on its vulnerable adversary, yet &quot;Virginia&quot; was able to scrape off the shore and rejoin the fight.

Later during the battle, Acting Master Louis N. Stodder and officers Stimers and Truscott were inside the gun turret, discussing the course of action. Stodder was leaning against the turret&#x27;s inside wall when it took a direct hit. Stodder was knocked unconscious and taken below, where it took him an hour to regain consciousness. Stodder thus became the first man injured during the battle. He was replaced by Stimers.

The battle finally ceased when a shell from &quot;Virginia&quot; struck the pilot house of &quot;Monitor&quot; and exploded, driving fragments of paint and iron through the viewing slits into Worden&#x27;s eyes and temporarily blinding him. As no one else could see to command the ship, &quot;Monitor&quot; was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and &quot;Monitor&quot; returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of &quot;Virginia&quot; believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although &quot;Minnesota&quot; was still aground, the falling tide meant that she was out of reach. Furthermore, &quot;Virginia&quot; had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, &quot;Monitor&quot; returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that &quot;Virginia&quot; was quitting, with orders only to protect &quot;Minnesota&quot; and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.
Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory wrote to Confederate President Davis of the action:

The conduct of the Officers and men of the squadron ... reflects unfading honor upon themselves and upon the Navy. The report will be read with deep interest, and its details will not fail to rouse the ardor and nerve the arms of our gallant seamen.
It will be remembered that the &quot;Virginia&quot; was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her heaviest guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her officers and crew strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.

In Washington, belief that &quot;Monitor&quot; had vanquished &quot;Virginia&quot; was so strong that Worden and his men were awarded the thanks of Congress:

 Resolved ... That the thanks of Congress and the American people are due and are hereby tendered to Lieutenant J. L. Worden, of the United States Navy, and to the officers and men of the ironclad gunboat &quot;Monitor&quot;, under his command, for the skill and gallantry exhibited by them in the remarkable battle between the &quot;Monitor&quot; and the rebel ironclad steamer &quot;Merrimack&quot;.

During the two-day engagement, USS &quot;Minnesota&quot; shot off 78 rounds of 10-inch solid shot; 67 rounds of 10-inch shells with 15-second fuse; 169 rounds of 9-inch solid shot; 180 9-inch shells with 15-second fuse; 35 8-inch shells with 15-second fuse and 5,567.5 pounds of service powder. Three crew members, Alexander Winslow, Henry Smith and Dennis Harrington were killed during the battle and 16 were wounded. One of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s crew, Quartermaster Peter Williams, was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the battle.

=== Spring 1862—a standoff at Hampton Roads ===
&quot;Virginia&quot; remained in drydock for almost a month, getting repairs for battle damage as well as minor modifications to improve her performance. On April 4, she was able to leave drydock. Buchanan, still recovering from his wound, had hoped that Catesby Jones would be picked to succeed him, and most observers believed that Jones&#x27;s performance during the battle was outstanding. The seniority system for promotion in the Navy scuttled his chances, however, and the post went to the 67-year-old Commodore Josiah Tattnall III. &quot;Monitor&quot;, not severely damaged, remained on duty. Like his antagonist Jones, Greene was deemed too young to remain as captain; the day after the battle, he was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr. Two days later, Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers.

By late March, the Union blockade fleet had been augmented by hastily refitted civilian ships, including the powerful SS &quot;Vanderbilt&quot;, , SS &quot;Illinois&quot;, and SS &quot;Ericsson&quot;. These had been outfitted with rams and some iron plating. By late April, the new ironclads USRC &quot;E. A. Stevens&quot; and had also joined the blockade.

Each side considered how best to eliminate the threat posed by its opponent, and after &quot;Virginia&quot; returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in waters not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in what amounted to posturing.

=== Destruction of the combatants ===
The end came first for &quot;Virginia&quot;. Because the blockade was unbroken, Norfolk was of little strategic use to the Confederacy, and preliminary plans were laid to move the ship up the James River to the vicinity of Richmond. Before adequate preparations could be made, the Confederate Army under Major General Benjamin Huger abandoned the city on May 9, without consulting anyone from the Navy. &quot;Virginia&quot;″s draft was too great to permit her to pass up the river, which had a depth of only , and then only under favorable circumstances. She was trapped and could only be captured or sunk by the Union Navy. Rather than allow either, Tatnall decided to destroy his own ship. He had her towed down to Craney Island in Portsmouth, where the gang were taken ashore, and then she was set afire. She burned through the rest of the day and most of the following night; shortly before dawn, the flames reached her magazine, and she blew up.

&quot;Monitor&quot; likewise did not survive the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, to take part in the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the &quot;Monitor&quot; took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.

== The victor ==
The victory claims that were made by each side in the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, as both were based on misinterpretations of the opponent&#x27;s behavior, have been dismissed by present-day historians. They agree that the result of the &quot;Monitor&quot;–&quot;Virginia&quot; encounter was not a victory for either side. As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle, the general verdict is that the overall result was a draw. All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received, which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory. Compared to other Civil War battles, the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat. On the other hand, the blockade was not seriously threatened, so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed.

However, initially after the Battle of Hampton Roads, both the Confederate and Union media claimed victory for their own sides. A headline in a Boston newspaper the day after the battle read &quot;The Merrimac Driven back by the Steamer!&quot;, implying a Union victory, while Confederate media focused on their original success against wooden Union ships. Despite the battle ending in a stalemate, it was seen by both sides as an opportunity to raise war-time morale, especially since the ironclad ships were an exciting naval innovation that intrigued citizens.

Evaluation of the strategic results is likewise disputed. The blockade was maintained, even strengthened, and &quot;Virginia&quot; was bottled up in Hampton Roads. Because a decisive Confederate weapon was negated, some have concluded that the Union could claim a strategic victory. Confederate advocates can counter, however, by arguing that &quot;Virginia&quot; had a military significance larger than the blockade, which was only a small part of the war in Tidewater Virginia. Her mere presence was sufficient to close the James River to Federal incursions. She also imposed other constraints on the Peninsula Campaign then being mounted by the Union Army under General George B. McClellan, who worried that she could interfere with his positions on the York River. Although his fears were baseless, they continued to affect the movements of his army until &quot;Virginia&quot; was destroyed.

== Impact upon naval warfare ==
Both days of the battle attracted attention from almost all the world&#x27;s navies. USS &quot;Monitor&quot; became the prototype for the monitor warship type. She thus became the first of two ships whose names were applied to entire classes of their successors, the other being . Many more were built, including river monitors, and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James rivers.

The US immediately started the construction of ten more monitors based on Ericsson&#x27;s original larger plan, known as the s. More than 20 additional monitors were built by the Union by the end of the war. However, while the design proved exceptionally well-suited for river combat, the low profile and heavy turret caused poor seaworthiness in rough waters. Russia, fearing that the American Civil War would spill into Russian Alaska, launched ten sister ships, as soon as Ericsson&#x27;s plans reached St. Petersburg. What followed has been described as &quot;Monitor mania&quot;. The revolving turret later inspired similar designs for future warships, which eventually became the modern battleship.

The vulnerability of wooden hulls to armored ships was noted particularly in Britain and France, where the wisdom of the planned conversion of the battle fleet to armor was given a powerful demonstration. Another feature that was emulated was not so successful. Impressed by the ease with which &quot;Virginia&quot; had sunk &quot;Cumberland&quot;, naval architects began to incorporate rams into their hull designs.

The first purpose-built ram in the modern era was the French armored ram , whose guns were said to have &quot;the sole function of preparing the way for the ram.&quot; The inclusion of rams in warship hull design persisted almost to the outbreak of World War I.

== Commemorating the battle: &quot;Virginia&quot; ==
The name of the warship that served the Confederacy in the Battle of Hampton Roads has been a continuing source of confusion and some contention. She was originally a screw frigate in the United States Navy carrying the name . All parties continued to use the name after her capture by secessionists while she was being rebuilt as an ironclad. When her conversion was almost complete, her name was officially changed to . Despite the official name change, Union accounts persisted in calling &quot;Merrimack&quot; by her original name, while Confederate sources used either &quot;Virginia&quot; or &quot;Merrimac(k)&quot;. The alliteration of &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Merrimack&quot; has persuaded most popular accounts to adopt the familiar name, even when it is acknowledged to be technically incorrect.

A CSS &quot;Merrimac&quot; did actually exist. She was a paddle wheel steamer named for the victor (as most Southerners saw it) at Hampton Roads. She was used for running the blockade until she was captured and taken into Federal service, still named &quot;Merrimac.&quot; Her name was a spelling variant of the river, namesake of USS &quot;Merrimack&quot;. Both spellings are still in use around the Hampton Roads area.

A small community in Montgomery County, Virginia, near the location where the iron for the Confederate ironclad was forged is now known as Merrimac. Some of the iron mined there and used in the plating on the Confederate ironclad is displayed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth. The anchor of &quot;Virginia&quot; sits on the lawn in front of the American Civil War Museum in Richmond.

== Commemorating the battle: &quot;Monitor&quot; ==
After resting undetected on the ocean floor for 111 years, the wreck of &quot;Monitor&quot; was located by a team of scientists in 1973. The remains of the ship were found upside down off Cape Hatteras, on a relatively flat, sandy bottom at a depth of about . In 1987, the site was declared a National Marine Sanctuary, the first shipwreck to receive this distinction.

Because of &quot;Monitor&quot;″s advanced state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners&#x27; Museum in Newport News, Virginia, where they were treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal. It is reported that it will take about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS &quot;Monitor&quot; Center at the Mariners&#x27; Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, the original recovered turret, and artifacts and related items are now on display.

== Commemorating the Battle of Hampton Roads ==
The Battle of Hampton Roads was a significant event in both Naval and Civil War history that has been detailed in many books, televised Civil War documentaries, and in film, to include TNT&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Ironclads&quot;. In New York City, where the designer of the Monitor, John Ericsson, died in March 1889, a statue was commissioned by the state to commemorate the battle between the Ironclads. The statue features a stylized male nude allegorical figure on water between two iron cleats. It is located in Msgr McGolrick Park.

In Virginia, the state dedicated the Monitor-Merrimack Overlook at Anderson Park on a jetty that overlooks the site of the battle. The park contains several historical markers commemorating both ships. Also, in 1992, Virginia dedicated the $400 million, 4.6-mile-long Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, which is located less than 1 mile from the site of the battle.

<text>Genetic counseling is the process of investigating individuals and families affected by or at risk of genetic disorders to help them understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. This field is considered necessary for the implementation of genomic medicine. The process integrates:
* Interpretation of family and medical histories to assess the chance of disease occurrence or recurrence
* Education about inheritance, testing, management, prevention, resources
* Counseling to promote informed choices, adaptation to the risk or condition and support in reaching out to relatives that are also at risk

== History ==
The practice of advising people about inherited traits began around the turn of the 20th century, shortly after William Bateson suggested that the new medical and biological study of heredity be called &quot;genetics&quot;. Heredity became intertwined with social reforms when the field of modern eugenics took form. Although initially well-intentioned, ultimately the movement had disastrous consequences; many states in the United States had laws mandating the sterilization of certain individuals, others were not allowed to immigrate and by the 1930s these ideas were accepted by many other countries including in Germany where euthanasia for the &quot;genetically defective&quot; was legalized in 1939. This part of the history of genetics is at the heart of the now &quot;non directive&quot; approach to genetic counseling.

Sheldon Clark Reed coined the term genetic counseling in 1947 and published the book &quot;Counseling in Medical Genetics&quot; in 1955. Most of the early genetic counseling clinics were run by non-medical scientists or by those who were not experienced clinicians. With the growth in knowledge of genetic disorders and the appearance of medical genetics as a distinct specialty in the 1960s, genetic counseling progressively became medicalized, representing one of the key components of clinical genetics. It was not, though, until later that the importance of a firm psychological basis was recognized and became an essential part of genetic counseling, the writings of Seymour Kessler making a particular contribution to this. The first master&#x27;s degree genetic counseling program in the United States was founded in 1969 at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. In 1979, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) was founded and led by the first president, Audrey Heimler.

== Detection and early processes ==

Diagnostic testing occurs when an individual is showing signs or symptoms associated with a specific condition. Genetic testing can be used to arrive at a definitive diagnosis in order to provide better prognosis as well as medical management or treatment options. Testing can reveal conditions can be mild or asymptomatic with early treatment, as opposed to debilitating without treatment (such as phenylketonuria). Genetic tests are available for a number of genetic conditions, including but not limited to: Down syndrome, sickle cell disease, Tay–Sachs disease, muscular dystrophy. Establishing a genetic diagnosis can provide information to other at-risk individuals in the family. 

Any reproductive risks (e.g. a chance to have a child with the same diagnosis) can also be explored after a diagnosis. Many disorders cannot occur unless both the mother and father pass on their genes, such as cystic fibrosis; this is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. Other autosomal dominant diseases can be inherited from one parent, such as Huntington disease and DiGeorge syndrome. Yet other genetic disorders are caused by an error or mutation occurring during the cell division process (e.g. aneuploidy) and are usually not inherited.

Screening tests are often used prior to diagnostic testing, designed to separate people according to a fixed characteristic or property, with the intention of detecting early evidence of disease. For example, if a screening test during a pregnancy (such as maternal blood screening or ultrasound) reveals a risk of a health issue or genetic condition, patients are encouraged to receive genetic counseling to learn additional information regarding the suspected condition. A discussion of the management, therapy and treatments available for the conditions may take place; the next step may differ depending on the severity of the condition and range from during pregnancy to after delivery. Patients may decline additional screening and testing, elect to proceed to diagnostic testing, or pursue further screening tests to refine the risk during the pregnancy.

Presymptomatic or predictive testing occurs when an individual knows of a specific diagnosis (typically adult onset) in their family and has other affected relatives, but they themselves do not manifest any clinical findings at the time when they seek testing. The decision about whether or not to proceed with presymptomatic testing should entail a thoughtful approach and consideration of various medical, reproductive, social, insurance, and financial factors, with no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; answer. Availability of treatment and medical management options for each specific diagnosis, as well as the genetics and inheritance pattern of the particular condition should be reviewed as inherited conditions can have reduced penetrance.

Insurance and legal issues should also be discussed during genetic counseling. There are laws in the United States such as GINA (Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act) and ACA that provide certain protections against discrimination for individuals with genetic diagnoses.

== Approach and session overview ==
=== Approach ===
There are different approaches to genetic counseling. The reciprocal-engagement model of genetic counseling practice includes tenets, goals, strategies, and behaviors for addressing patients&#x27; genetic concerns. Some counselors favor a psycho-educational approach while others incorporate more psycho-therapeutic techniques. Genetic counseling is psycho-educational as patients &quot;learn how genetics contributes to their health risks and then process what this means and how it feels.&quot;

Whether the process of genetic counseling is a form of psychotherapy is up for debate. The relationship between the client and counselor is similar as are the goals of the sessions. As a psychotherapist aims to help his client improve his wellbeing, a genetic counselor also helps his client to address a &quot;situational health threat that similarly threatens client wellbeing&quot;. Due to the lack of studies which compare genetic counseling to the practice of psychotherapy, it is hard to say with certainty whether genetic counseling can be &quot;conceptualized as a short-term, applied, specific type of psychotherapy&quot;. However, there few existing studies suggest that genetic counseling falls &quot;significantly short of psychotherapeutic counseling&quot; because genetic counseling sessions primarily consist of the distribution of information without much emphasis placed on explaining any long-term impacts to the client.

=== Structure ===
The goals of genetic counseling are to increase understanding of genetic diseases, discuss disease management options and explain the risks and benefits of testing. Counseling sessions focus on giving vital, unbiased information and non-directive assistance in the patient&#x27;s decision-making process. Seymour Kessler, in 1979, first categorized sessions in five phases: an intake phase, an initial contact phase, the encounter phase, the summary phase, and a follow-up phase. The intake and follow-up phases occur outside of the actual counseling session. The initial contact phase is when the counselor and families meet and build rapport. The encounter phase includes dialogue between the counselor and the client about the nature of screening and diagnostic tests. The summary phase provides all the options and decisions available for the next step. If patients wish to go ahead with testing, an appointment is organized and the genetic counselor acts as the person to communicate the results. Result delivery can happen both in person or via phone. Often counselors will call out results to avoid patients having to come back in as results can take weeks to be processed. If further counseling is needed in a more personal setting, or it is determined that additional family members should be tested, a secondary appointment can be made.

=== Support ===
Genetic counselors provide supportive counseling to families, serve as patient advocates and refer individuals and families to community or state support services. They serve as educators and resource people for other health care professionals and for the general public. Many engage in research activities related to the field of medical genetics and genetic counseling. When communicating increased risk, counselors anticipate the likely distress and prepare patients for the results. Counselors help clients cope with and adapt to the emotional, psychological, medical, social, and economic consequences of the test results.

Each individual considers their family needs, social setting, cultural background, and religious beliefs when interpreting their risk. Clients must evaluate their reasoning to continue with testing at all. Counselors are present to put all the possibilities in perspective and encourage clients to take time to think about their decision. When a risk is found, counselors frequently reassure parents that they were not responsible for the result. An informed choice without pressure or coercion is made when all relevant information has been given and understood.

After counseling for other hereditary conditions, the patient may be presented with the option of having genetic testing. In some circumstances no genetic testing is indicated, other times it may be useful to begin the testing process with an affected family member. The genetic counselor also reviews the advantages and disadvantages of genetic testing with the patient.

=== Outcomes ===
The most commonly measured genetic counseling outcomes included knowledge, anxiety or distress, satisfaction, perceived risk, genetic testing (intentions or receipt), health behaviors, and decisional conflict. Results suggest that genetic counseling can lead to increased knowledge, perceived personal control, positive health behaviors, and improved risk perception accuracy as well as decreases in anxiety, cancer-related worry, and decisional conflict.

== Sub-specialties ==
=== Adult genetics ===
Adult or general genetics clinics serve patients who are diagnosed with genetic conditions that begin to show signs or symptoms in adulthood. Many genetic conditions have varying ages of onset, ranging from an infantile form to an adult form. Genetic counseling can facilitate the decision-making process by providing the patient/family with education about the genetic condition as well as the medical management options available to individuals at risk of developing the condition. Having the genetic information of other members of the family opens the door to asking important questions about the pattern of inheritance of specific disease‐causing mutations. Whilst there is a wealth of literature that describes how families communicate information surrounding single genes, there is very little which explores the experience of communication about family genomes. Adult-onset disorders may overlap multiple specialties.

=== ART/Infertility genetics ===
Genetic counseling is an integral part of the process for patients utilizing preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), formerly called preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of PGT and all require in vitro fertilization (IVF) using assisted reproductive technology (ART). PGT-M, for monogenic disorders, involves testing embryos for a specific condition before it is implanted into the mother. This technique is currently being done for disorders with childhood onset, such as Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs and Muscular Dystrophy, as well as adult-onset conditions, including Huntington&#x27;s Disease, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, and Lynch Syndrome. PGT-SR, for structural rearrangements, involves testing embryos to establish a pregnancy unaffected by a structural chromosomal abnormality (translocation). PGT-A, for aneuploidy, was formerly called preimplantation genetic screening, and involved testing embryos to identify any de novo aneuploidy. The indications to carry out PGT-A are: previous aneuploidy in the couple, implantation failure, recurrent miscarriage, severe male factor or advanced maternal age. Finally, PGT seems to be: safe for the embryo, trustable in the diagnosis, more efficient from the reproductive point of view and cost-effective.

Genetic counseling can also involve medical evaluation and clinical work-up for couples with infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss, as these histories can be associated with parental chromosome aberrations (such as inversions or translocations) and other genetic conditions.

=== Cardiovascular genetics ===
A rapidly expanding field in genetic counseling is cardiovascular genetics. More than 1 in 200 people have an inherited cardiovascular disease. Hereditary cardiac conditions range from common diseases, such as high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, to rare diseases like Long QT Syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and vascular diseases.  Genetic counselors who specialize in cardiovascular disease have developed skills specific to the management of and counseling for genetic cardiovascular disorders and practice in both the pediatric and adult setting. Cardiovascular genetic counselors are also integral in local and national efforts to prevent sudden cardiac death, which is the leading cause of sudden death in young people. This is done by identifying patients with known or suspected heritable cardiovascular diseases and promoting cascade family screening or testing of at-risk relatives.

Common referral reasons include:
* Cardiomyopathy, including, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and familial idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
* Arrhythmia, including Long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome
* Vascular disease, including Marfan syndrome and aortic aneurysm and/or dissection (&lt;50 years old)
* Congenital heart defects (e.g. conotruncal defects, left ventricular outflow tract defects)
* Familial hypercholesterolemia
* Family history of unexplained sudden death

Guidelines on cardiovascular genetics are published by multiple professional societies.
=== Hereditary cancer genetics ===
Cancer genetic counselors see individuals with a personal diagnosis or family history of cancer or symptoms of an inherited cancer syndrome. Genetic counselors take a family history and assess for hereditary risk, or risk that can be passed down from generation to generation. If indicated, they can coordinate genetic testing, typically via blood or saliva sample, to evaluate for hereditary cancer risk.  Personalized medical management and cancer screening recommendations can be provided based on results of genetic testing or the family history of cancer. While most cancers are sporadic (not inherited), some are more likely to have a hereditary factor, particularly when occurring at young ages or when clustering in families. These include common cancers such as breast, ovarian, colon and uterine cancers, as well as rare tumor types. General referral indications can include, but are not limited to:
* Personal or family history of cancer with unusually young age of onset (e.g. breast cancer under age 45, colon cancer under age 50)
* Diagnosis of a tumor or cancer with a high likelihood to be hereditary (e.g. male breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, metastatic or high-grade prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, retinoblastoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, neuroendocrine tumor, medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma)
* Personal or family history of bilateral cancers (e.g., both breasts or both kidneys) or multiple primary tumors in one person
* Features associated with an inherited cancer syndrome (e.g. more than 10 adenomatous polyps, rare types of gastrointestinal polyps, such as hamartomatous polyps), or specific skin findings like café au lait macules or freckling on the lips
* Family history of related cancers clustered on the same side of the family (e.g. breast/ovarian, colon/uterine, sarcoma/leukemia/brain)
* Family history of a known inherited cancer syndrome (e.g. hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome)
* Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer
* Possible germline (inherited) genetic mutation suggested by tumor profile testing

===Neurogenetics===
Genetic counselors specializing in neurogenetics are involved in the care of individuals who have or are at risk to develop conditions affecting the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or peripheral nervous system (the nerves that leave the spinal cord and go to other places in the body, such as the feet and hands, skeletal muscles, and internal organs). Effects of these conditions can lead to various impairments some examples of which include cognitive decline, intellectual disability, seizures, uncontrolled movements (e.g. ataxia, chorea), muscle weakness, paralysis, or atrophy. Examples of neurogenetic disorders include:
* Brain malformation syndromes, including lissencephaly and polymicrogyria
* Brain tumor predisposition syndromes, including Neurofibromatosis 1 and 2
* Epilepsy (seizures)
* Hereditary motor neuron diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease) and spinal muscular atrophy
* Hereditary neuropathies, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
* Intellectual disabilities, developmental delays, and autism spectrum disorder
* Leukodystrophy (hereditary white matter diseases)
* Memory and other cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer disease and frontotemporal dementia
* Movement disorders, including hereditary ataxia, spastic paraplegia, Huntington disease, and Parkinson disease
* Neuromuscular disorders, including muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies, and congenital myasthenic syndromes
=== Pediatric genetics ===
Pediatric genetic counseling can be indicated for newborns, infants, children and their families. General referral indications can include:  
* Birth defect(s) or multiple congenital anomalies (cleft lip/palate, heart defects, spina bifida)
* Intellectual disability of unknown cause, learning disabilities, or autism
* Sensory impairments (vision, hearing)
* Metabolic disorders (PKU, galactosemia, inborn errors of metabolism)
* Known/Suspected genetic disorders (e.g., Down syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis, Muscular Dystrophy)
* Primary immunodeficiency

===Prenatal genetics===
Prenatal genetics involves services for women either during or prior to a pregnancy.

General indications for referral to genetic counseling in the preconception or prenatal setting may include, but are not limited to:
* Advanced maternal age (35 years old or older at time of delivery)
* Advanced paternal age
* Current pregnancy with anomalies identified by ultrasound (e.g. increased nuchal translucency measurements)
* Current pregnancy with an abnormal genetic screening test or test result
* Current pregnancy with risk of or concern for maternal exposures, such as medications, radiation, drugs/alcohol, or infections
* Consanguineous union (cousins or otherwise blood related)
* Family history of an inherited genetic condition or chromosome abnormality
* Genetic carrier screening for recessive and/or X-linked diseases
* History of a previous child with a birth defect, developmental delay, or other genetic condition
* History of infertility, multiple unexplained miscarriages or cases of unexplained infant deaths
* Molecular test for single gene disorder

Prenatal genetic counseling may help with the decision-making process by walking patients through examples of what some people might do in similar situations, and their rationale for choosing that option. Decisions made by patients are affected by factors including timing, accuracy of information provided by tests, and risk and benefits of the tests. This discussion enables patients to place the information and circumstances into the context of their own lives, and in the context of their own values. They may choose to undergo noninvasive screening (e.g. ultrasound, triple screen, cell-free fetal DNA screening) or invasive diagnostic testing (amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling). Invasive diagnostic tests possess a small risk of miscarriage (1–2%) but provide more definitive results. Testing is offered to provide a definitive answer regarding the presence of a certain genetic condition or chromosomal abnormality. Prenatal genetic counseling also comes with ethical concerns both as the parents and as the counselor. It is important to consider all factors that go into the counseling, race, ethnic background, family history, and other significant issues that may arise.

=== Psychiatric genetics ===
Psychiatric genetic counseling is a sub-specialty within genetic counseling focused on helping people living with a psychiatric disorder and/or their family members understand both the genetic and environmental factors that contributed to their illness and address associated emotions such as guilt or self-blame. Genetic counselors also discuss strategies to promote recovery and protect mental health and address any questions on chances for recurrence in other family members. While currently there is no single gene solely responsible for causing a psychiatric disorder, there is strong evidence from family, twin studies, and genome-wide-association studies that both multiple genes and environment interact together. Like other areas of genetic counseling, patients at all different stages of life (pediatric, adult, prenatal) can have psychiatric genetic counseling. Since the etiology of psychiatric disorders is complex and not fully understood, the utility of genetic testing is not as clear as it is in Mendelian or single gene disorders. Research has shown that individuals who receive psychiatric genetic counseling have significant increases in feelings of empowerment and self-efficacy after genetic counseling.

Psychiatric genetic counselors can help &quot;dispel mistaken notions about psychiatric disorders, calm needless anxiety, and help those at risk to draw up a rational plan of action based on the best available information&quot;.

==Global Genetic Counseling Community==

In 2023, it was estimated there were over 10,000 genetic counsellors globally, practicing in over 45 countries. This is a marked increase over the 2018 data, which showed less than 7000 genetic counselors in at least 28 countries. The increased numbers of genetic counsellors over the period 2018-2023 is mostly accounted for by growth in the number of genetic counsellors in the US.

=== China ===
Genetic counseling in China (mainland) has been primarily provided by pediatricians or obstetricians for prenatal or birth defect diagnoses. Most genetic tests can only be performed in academic institutions as research tests or in commercial direct-to-consumer companies for non-clinical use.

In China, genetic counseling is steered by the Chinese Board of Genetic Counseling (CBGC), a not-for-profit organization. CBGC is composed of senior experts engaged in genetic education and research. CBGC is committed to establishing standardized procedures of genetic counseling, training qualified genetic counselors, improving health for all, and reducing the incidence of birth defects. CBGC was established in 2015 and is the major professional organization for genetic counselors in mainland China, providing training through short term online and in-person lectures, educational conferences, and certification for trainees.

Genetics education in China began in the 1980s when selected medical schools began offering genetics courses that focused predominantly on molecular genetics and had limited clinical content. At present, there are no official master&#x27;s level graduate programs in genetic counseling or clinical genetics in China, and there is great variability in the duration and content of genetics curricula among medical schools and professional organizations.

The Chinese Ministry of Health has not yet recognized genetic counselors as an independent health care occupation. There are no official statistics for the number of health care professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, and lab technicians) who are providing genetic counseling services in China. As of 2023, it was estimated that there were 4000-6000 genetic counsellors in China, however in China certification to work as a genetic counsellor is given after completing a very short training course (1-2 week equivalent). As such, genetic counsellors in China cannot be held to the same standard as those who are trained in other countries.

=== Africa ===

==== South Africa ====
Genetic Counselling is a developing field in South Africa. As of 2023, there are about 30 registered genetic counsellors practicing in the country, up from around 20 in 2018. South African genetic counsellors work at academic institutions, in the private health sector and more recently, private genetic laboratories. As of 2023, approximately two thirds of all genetic counsellors working in South Africa are employed in the private healthcare sector. Some qualified genetic counsellors are employed outside of the country or in other professions, owing to funding limitations that have severely impacted employment opportunities.

The first genetic counselling programme in South Africa started in 1989 at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. A second programme started in 2004 at the University of Cape Town. These are the only two programmes offering Masters level genetic counselling training in South Africa. Currently these courses are running at full capacity. This is a two-year degree and includes a research component. The majority of students enter the Masters programme with a science background but those with a psychology background are also considered.

The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) requires two years of internship. Often the first year forms part of the master&#x27;s degree in Genetic Counselling and a further 12-month internship thereafter. Genetic Counsellors are required by law to register with the HPCSA in order to practice as genetic counsellors. At the end of the training period, registrants submit a portfolio to the HPCSA for assessment. If successful, the intern will be registered with the HPCSA and will be able to practice as a genetic counsellor in South Africa.

There is a professional organisation for Genetic Counsellors in South Africa, Genetic Counselling South Africa (GC-SA), which provides information and guidance to the HPCSA and others regarding professional issues. The GCSA is a focus group of the South African Society of Human Genetics (SASHG).

==== Ghana ====
The University of Ghana&#x27;s two-year genetic counselling Master&#x27;s degree began accepting enrolments in 2022. The program, which was made to address an Africa-wide shortage of genetic counsellors, and to facilitate related research, was developed in close collaboration with the two courses in South Africa. Upon graduation, the graduates in Ghana will register with the Psychological Council of Ghana or another regulatory body to enable them to practice in the country.

=== Europe ===
As of 2023, around 960 genetic counsellors practice in 19 European nations: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. As of 2023, there were about 960 genetic counselors practicing in Europe, a number that has only increased very slightly since 2018. Formal GC registration occurs through two different programs: in the United Kingdom (via the GCRB as described below) and the European Union via the European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG). Genetic counselors are not currently recognized as a profession in several European countries including Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Portugal. This is likely due to legal restrictions in these countries, which classify genetic counseling as a medical discipline, and therefore must be conducted by physicians.

==== Training ====
As of 2023, there were 12 active training programs across Europe: Austria, Belgium, France (three programs), Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (two programs). All are Master&#x27;s degrees except for the graduate diploma program in Belgium, which trains students who already have a degree in healthcare. Since 2018, genetic counsellor training in The Netherlands has ceased due to legal problems relating to the private practice of genetic counsellors. However, genetic counselling training remains part of the Master&#x27;s of Physician Assistant and Advanced Nurse Practice degrees. The program in Romania remained inactive as of 2023, and one of the programs in France is expected to close.

==== International and Local Reciprocity ====
Due to the limited Master&#x27;s level Genetic Counseling programs located in Europe, the EBMG organization recognizes practicing genetic counselors that trained in Australia, Canada, South Africa and the US. These counselors must possess current registration or certification from their home country and must work full time in Europe for one year to apply for registration with EBMG.

==== Professional organizations ====
* The Association of Genetic Nurses and Counsellors (AGNC) is the UK&#x27;s professional organization representing genetic counsellors, genetic nurses and non-medical, patient-facing staff working within the discipline of Clinical Genetics. There are currently (March 2018) 330 AGNC members within the UK. The AGNC is one of the constituent groups of the British Society for Genetic Medicine (BSGM).
* European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG) developed competencies and standards of practice for GC registration within the European Union (EU).
* The Association of Genetic Counselors (APPAcGen), is working to achieve recognition of the profession of GCs in Portugal.
* The Romanian Association of Genetic Counseling (RAGC) was founded to set national practice standards and lobby for recognition as a distinct health profession. In the meantime, genetic counseling tends to adhere to international organizations&#x27; guidelines (e.g., EBMG)
* In Norway there is an &quot;Interest Organization for Genetic Counselors in Norway&quot;, which meets yearly.

==== United Kingdom ====
The majority of Genetic Counsellors in the UK work in the National Health Service (NHS) in one of the 33 Regional Clinical Genetics Services (some renamed Genomic Medicine Centres in England), Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Others work in specialist roles in the NHS, education, policy or research. A minority work in the private sector.

The first two-year MSc in Genetic Counselling program established in the UK was from the University of Manchester in 1992, followed by Cardiff University in Wales in 2000. 2016 saw major changes in the way genetic counsellors are trained in England. A 3-year training programme funded by Health Education England, the Scientist Training Programme (STP) uses a combination of work-based training in Genomic Medicine Centres and a part-time MSc in genetics (Genomic Counselling) from the University of Manchester. Recruitment is performed nationally through the National School of Healthcare Science (NSHCS). A 3-year part-time MSc in Genetic and Genomic Counselling is also now delivered by Cardiff University, through blended learning, with most of the teaching delivered online, alongside some short face-to-face teaching blocks in Wales. A 2-year MSc Genetic and Genomic Counselling program began at the University of Glasgow in Scotland in 2016. Prerequisites for acceptance on all the programmes include a degree in a relevant science or a nursing or midwifery qualification, and experience in a caring role.

Credentialing/certification/licensure
Genetic counselling training programmes are accredited by the UK Genetic Counsellor Registration Board (GCRB) and the European Board of Medical Genetics (EBMG). Genetic counsellors in the UK are regulated through the GCRB, although currently GCRB registration is voluntary. The GCRB registry was accredited in 2016 by the Professional Standards Authority under its Accredited Registers programme. Over 200 genetic counsellors are currently registered through the GCRB. Genetic Counsellors trained through the STP programme are expected to be eligible to apply for statutory regulation through the Health Care Professions Council and it is planned that soon there will be equivalence arrangements with the GCRB to ensure statutory regulation for GCRB registered genetic counsellors. In order to be eligible for GCRB credentialing, one of two sets of requirements must be met: completion of a 2-year Master&#x27;s of Science degree and 2 years of experience as a genetic counselor, or completion of a 3-year combined Master&#x27;s program and work-based training. In addition, a portfolio including a 50 case logbook, evidence of supervision, case studies, essays, and recorded counseling sessions is required.

In order to be eligible for EBMG credentialing, a Master&#x27;s of Science in genetic counseling is required, along with a portfolio including a logbook of 50 cases, case studies, references, and reflective essays. Both the EBMG and the GCRB also offer an alternative route to credentialing in which the applicant completes a nursing degree.

Reciprocity (internationally and locally)
The GCRB offers credentialing for internationally trained genetic counselors.

=== Australia/New Zealand ===
Genetic counselling in Australasia has developed similarly to the US. As of early 2022, there were almost 400 active genetic counsellors in Australia and New Zealand, according to the database maintained by the Australasian Society of Genetic Counsellors. This represents 346 FTE genetic counsellors working in clinical practice, an increase of more than 50% since 2017. However, in 2023 it was estimated that there was demand enough for 418 FTE GCs in Australasia. Workforce demand planning is complicated by the fact that one third of individuals with a GC degree in Australia are not in clinical practice, and there is a shortage of GC roles in the public system due to a lack of funding. In order to practice as a GC, individuals must first attain a Master&#x27;s degree in genetic counselling, after which time they can practice as an associate genetic counsellor. Then, following at least two years of supervised practice and successful passing of assessment as set by the Australasian Society of Genetic Counsellors&#x27; Board of Censors, an individual can then be accredited by the Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA) and registered through the National Alliance of Self Regulating Health Professions as an independent GC. Most GCs practice in public or private hospital settings, but roles in private ambulatory care, genomic diagnostic laboratories, industry, and in academia (teaching and research) are becoming increasingly common. Both public and private healthcare services are available in Australia and New Zealand. Genetic services are offered through the public health system in all states and territories. In the public system, genetic testing is paid for by the state governments when the test is deemed clinically appropriate by the GC and clinical geneticist. GCs in private practice may also offer &#x27;self-funded&#x27; genetic testing, which is paid for out-of-pocket by the client/patient. Economic modelling commissioned by the HGSA in 2024 found that adding genetic counselling to the Medicare system would produce $2.53 in benefits for every dollar spent on genetic counselling services. These benefits are made up of economic and social savings arising from reductions in treatment delays and reductions in premature deaths, and benefits relating to easier access to genetic counselling services.

==== Training ====
A one-year graduate diploma program was established in 1995, and a two-year Master&#x27;s level training program was established in 2008. As of 2024, two Master&#x27;s training programs in Australia accredited by the Human Genetics Society of Australasia (HGSA), one at the University of Melbourne and one at the University of Technology Sydney. Genetic counselling education in Australia is clinically focussed. Together, these two universities produce more than 30 graduates each year.

==== Certification ====
New graduates practice as an Associate Genetic Counselor under the supervision of a certified genetic counselor and a clinical geneticist. They can submit to the HGSA certification process via a portfolio application after one year of practice. Recertification is currently voluntary and available by completing continuing education units (CEUs).

==== Reciprocity (internationally and locally) ====
Genetic counselors with training from the UK, Europe and Australia are eligible for registration and GCs qualified in other countries are considered on a case-by-case basis. Information is available through the Australasian Society of Genetic Counsellors, a special interest group of the Human Genetics Society of Australasia.

==== Demographics ====
A 2023 survey of GCs in Australia &amp; NZ provided insight into the self-reported demographics of practicing GCs with a view to understanding the diversity, inclusion, and capacities of the GC workforce. The survey found 92% of Australasian GCs are female, 93% live in major cities, two identified as Māori, one identified as an Aboriginal Australian, and none identified as a Torres Strait Islander. 81% were proficient in English only and 64% did not report any religious affiliation. These and many other demographic factors were found to be significantly different to the populations of Australia &amp; New Zealand. Many GCs also reported their teams were not diverse in these and other areas, but that initiatives to make diversity visible were widely used.

=== North America ===
==== Education ====
A genetic counselor is an expert with a Master of Science degree in genetic counseling. Programs in North America are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC). There are currently 52 accredited programs in the United States, four accredited programs in Canada, and four programs with the intent to become accredited. Students enter the field from a variety of disciplines, including biology/biological sciences and social sciences such as psychology. Graduate school coursework includes topics such as human genetics, embryology, ethics, research, and counseling theory and techniques. Clinical training including supervised rotations in prenatal, pediatric, adult, cancer, and other subspecialty clinics, as well as non-patient facing rotations in laboratories. Research training typically culminates in a capstone or thesis project.

==== State licensure ====
As of May 2019, 29 states have passed genetic counselor licensure bills that require genetic counselors to meet a certain set of standards to practice. These states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, and Washington. Almost every other state in the United States is in the process of obtaining genetic counseling licensure.

Although genetic counseling has been established over four decades, the first licenses for genetic counselors were not issued until 2002. Utah was the first state to do so. The American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) has since encouraged more states to license genetic counselors before they are allowed to practice. ASHG argues that requiring practitioners to go through the necessary training and testing to obtain a license will ensure quality genetic services as well as allow for reimbursement for counselors&#x27; services. Laws requiring licensure ensure that &quot;professionals who call themselves genetic counselors are able to properly explain complicated test results that could confuse patients and families making important health decisions&quot;.

==== Reimbursement and recognition ====
Insurance companies usually do not reimburse for unlicensed genetic counselors&#x27; services. Patients who may benefit from genetic counseling may not be able to afford the service due to the expensive out-of-pocket cost. In addition, licensure allows genetic counselors to be searchable in most insurance companies&#x27; databases which gives genetic counselors increased opportunities for earning revenue and clients the opportunity to see &quot;the level of coverage insurers provide for their services&quot;.

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not currently recognize genetic counselors as healthcare providers and therefore does not reimburse for genetic counseling services unless they are provided by a physician or nurse practitioner. On June 12, 2019, H.R. 3235 &quot;Access to Genetic Counselor Services Act of 2019,&quot; was introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives by U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa) and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania). H.R. 3235 would authorize CMS to recognize certified genetic counselors as healthcare providers and to cover services furnished by genetic counselors under part B of the Medicare program. Genetic counselors are those licensed by states as such, or, for those in states without licensure, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will set criteria through regulation (likely ABGC certification). Genetic counselors would be paid at 85% of the physician fee schedule. Other providers currently providing genetic counseling services will not be affected by the bill.

==== Job outlook ====
As genetic counseling continues to grow as a branch in the medical field, employment rates of genetic counselors are expected to grow by 21% over the next decade; this statistic suggests that approximately 600 new jobs will become available in the US over this time period. Graduating from an accredited program with a passing score on the board certification exam increases the job prospect. As of May 2019 the median annual wage for genetic counselors was $81,880; the lowest 10% earning less than $61,310 and the highest 10% earning more than $114,750. This includes the varying industries in this field, such as medial and diagnostic laboratories, offices of physicians, hospitals, and colleges/universities.

=== Latin America ===
Cuba is the only country in Central and South America with a significant number of GCs, all of whom work for the Ministry of Health&#x27;s National Center for Medical Genetics. In 2017 it was estimated there were 900 masters-qualified GCs in the country, while a 2023 update revised this number down to 474. This decrease is attributed to emigration, retirement, and deaths due to COVID-19. In all other Latin American countries, GCs are either rare or non-existent. Training programs exist in Brazil (master&#x27;s) and Chile (postgraduate diploma) and it is known that GCs are working in Chile, Guatemala and Mexico.

=== The Middle East ===
The number of genetic counsellors in this region increased from 100 in 2018 to 220 in 2023. In Israel, there are 150 licensed genetic counselors as of 2023, who must work under the supervision of a medical geneticist. Most practice in genetics departments in hospital settings, with a few working in industry or research.

==== Training ====
The first training program in Israel started in 1997. There are currently three programs that offer a master&#x27;s degree in genetic counseling, training 20 students per year. The first training program in Saudi Arabia was a graduate diploma in 2005 with a master&#x27;s degree being available as of 2015. There are two training programs available in Saudi Arabia with approximately 10 trained genetic counselors graduating per year.

Master&#x27;s level training programs were instituted in Qatar in 2018, Turkiye in 2020, the UAE in 2024, and one is planned to begin in Oman in 2025.

==== Credentialing/certification/licensure ====
The Israeli Ministry of Health offers licensure to genetic counselors in Israel following an exam written one year after their post-graduate work and 85-case logbook. Recertification is not required as licensure is permanent after the exam. Licensure is also offered through the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) following a panel interview, testing, or oral exam by a medical board; recertification in this country is under review at this time, but all counselors practicing in Saudi Arabia are expected to obtain a license from the SCHS.

== Media ==

The National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) blog provides information about current topics in genetic testing and genetic counseling.

=== Public attitude ===
Many studies have examined the attitudes of the lay public toward genetic counseling and genetic testing. Barriers to obtaining genetic counseling include lack of understanding of genetics by both patients and healthcare providers, concerns about cost and insurance, and fears of stigma or discrimination.

The reach of genetic testing and health equity is expanding due to telephone counseling. Telephone delivery has proven &quot;less expensive, yielded non-inferior cognitive, minimized psychological distress, facilitated informed decision making, and achieved positive counselor-patient interactions.&quot; As a result, telephone-based genetic counseling and testing are now commonly offered and reimbursed by many insurance companies.

No simple correlation has been found between the change in technology to the changes in values and beliefs towards genetic testing.

=== Health disparities ===
An increase in genetic counseling outreach efforts are needed to intentionally extend opportunities to populations that have been historically underrepresented in the profession to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce and access to services. Given the history of low engagement of under-represented minority populations in both clinical genetic services and genetic research, both of these aspects will be challenged and must be addressed before the benefits of precision medicine will be fully realized.

== Future Directions ==
In Europe and Australia, the current model of care in genetic counselling involves clients being referred by a general practitioner or other medical professional to a publicly funded hospital-based genetics service. Due to the rapid increase in demand for genetic counselling services, new ways to integrate genetic counselling into the healthcare system are being actively investigated. Future potential models of care currently being trialled include the genetic counsellor-embedded model, where genetic counsellors are integrated into hospital departments from which patients are referred, such as cancer and immunology. Another model of care that has been investigated is the provision of specially-trained nurses or other non-genetics healthcare personnel to identify persons eligible for genetic testing, and to provide pre-test counselling. Taken together, these alternative models of care are called genetic counselling mainstreaming. Mainstreaming has also been proposed to alleviate the administrative and clinical workload of GCs, as other healthcare providers would take on aspects of genetic counselling.

<doc id="251489" wikidata="Q1410980" url="?curid=251489" title="Ironclad warship">
<text>An ironclad was a steam-propelled warship protected by steel or iron armor constructed from 1859 to the early 1890s. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859, narrowly preempting the British Royal Navy. However, Britain built the first completely iron-hulled warships.

They were first used in warfare in 1862 during the American Civil War, when ironclads operated against wooden ships and, in a historic confrontation, against each other at the Battle of Hampton Roads in Virginia. Their performance demonstrated that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. Ironclad gunboats became very successful in the American Civil War.

Ironclads were designed for several uses, including as high-seas battleships, long-range cruisers, and coastal defense ships. Rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships, and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns, more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in ferrous metallurgy that made steel shipbuilding possible.

The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete almost as soon as they were finished and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the naval ram, the torpedo, or sometimes both (as in the case with smaller ships and later torpedo boats), which several naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but toward the end of the 1890s, the term &quot;ironclad&quot; dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated as battleships or armored cruisers.

== Development ==
The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century. According to naval historian J. Richard Hill: &quot;The (ironclad) had three chief characteristics: a metal-skinned hull, steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells. It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad.&quot; Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads.

=== Steam propulsion ===

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, fleets had relied on two types of major warship, the ship of the line and the frigate. The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion. While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onward, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.

Steam-powered screw frigates were built in the mid-1840s, and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle. Napoleon III&#x27;s ambition to gain greater influence in Europe required a sustained challenge to the British at sea. The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun in 1850. &quot;Napoléon&quot; was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of , regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.

The introduction of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to &quot;Napoléon&quot; were built in France over a period of ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.

=== Explosive shells ===
The era of the wooden steam ship-of-the-line was brief, because of new, more powerful naval guns. In the 1820s and 1830s, warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns, replacing 18- and 24-pounder guns with 32-pounders on sailing ships-of-the-line and introducing 68-pounders on steamers. Then, the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri-Joseph Paixhans. By the 1840s they were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy, Royal Navy, Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy.

It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls, as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop, spelled the end of the wooden-hulled warship. The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red-hot shot, which could lodge in the hull and cause a fire or ammunition explosion. Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power.

=== Iron armor ===

The use of wrought iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships&#x27; hulls began in the 1830s; the first &quot;warship&quot; with an iron hull was the gunboat &quot;Nemesis&quot;, built by Jonathan Laird of Birkenhead for the East India Company in 1839. There followed, also from Laird, the first full-sized warship with a metal hull, the 1842 steam frigate &quot;Guadalupe&quot; for the Mexican Navy. The latter ship performed well during the Naval Battle of Campeche, with her captain reporting that he thought that there were fewer iron splinters from &quot;Guadalupe&quot;″s hull than from a wooden hull.

Encouraged by the positive reports of the iron hulls of those ships in combat, the Admiralty ordered a series of experiments to evaluate what happened when thin iron hulls were struck by projectiles, both solid shot and hollow shells, beginning in 1845 and lasting through 1851. Critics like Lieutenant-general Sir Howard Douglas believed that the splinters from the hull were even more dangerous than those from wooden hulls and the tests partially confirmed this belief. What was ignored was that of wood backing the iron would stop most of the splinters from penetrating and that relatively thin plates of iron backed by the same thickness of wood would generally cause shells to split open and fail to detonate. One factor in the performance of wrought iron during these tests that was not understood by metallurgists of the day was that wrought iron begins to become brittle at temperatures below . Many of the tests were conducted at temperatures below this while the battles were fought in tropical climates.

The early experimental results seemed to support the critics and party politics came into play as the Whig First Russell ministry replaced the Tory Second Peel Ministry in 1846. The new administration sided with the critics and ordered that the four iron-hulled propeller frigates ordered by the Tories be converted into troopships. No iron warships would be ordered until the beginning of the Crimean War in 1854.

Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sinop, and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Paixhans guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War, Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light-draft floating batteries, equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor. Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory, and on 17 July 1854, the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun-proof vessels and that plans would be communicated. After tests in September 1854, the British Admiralty agreed to build five armored floating batteries on the French plans.

The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries (&quot;Lave&quot;, &quot;Tonnante&quot; and &quot;Dévastation&quot;) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859. The British floating batteries and arrived too late to participate to the action at Kinburn. The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well-fortified Russian naval base at Kronstadt.

The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only under their own power: they operated under their own power at the Battle of Kinburn, but had to be towed for long-range transit. They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy. The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their battlefleet.

== Early ironclad ships and battles ==
By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859. &quot;Gloire&quot;″s wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line, reduced to one deck, and sheathed in iron plates thick. She was propelled by a steam engine, driving a single screw propeller for a speed of . She was armed with thirty-six rifled guns. France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships, including two sister ships to &quot;Gloire&quot;, and the only two-decked broadside ironclads ever built, and .

The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line, but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect, particularly speed. A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement that could make her invulnerable to enemy fire. The British specification was more a large, powerful frigate than a ship-of-the-line. The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel, which had to be built from iron. The result was the construction of two s; and . The ships had a successful design, though there were necessarily compromises between &#x27;sea-keeping&#x27;, strategic range and armor protection. Their weapons were more effective than those of &quot;Gloire&quot;, and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship, they could steam at 14.3 knots (26.5 km/h). Yet the &quot;Gloire&quot; and her sisters had full iron-armor protection along the waterline and the battery itself.

The British &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Black Prince&quot; (but also the smaller &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Resistance&quot;) were obliged to concentrate their armor in a central &quot;citadel&quot; or &quot;armoured box&quot;, leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected. The use of iron in the construction of &quot;Warrior &quot;also came with some drawbacks; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life.

By 1862, navies across Europe had adopted ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles using the new ironclad ships took place during the American Civil War, between Union and Confederate ships in 1862. These were markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of &quot;Gloire&quot; and &quot;Warrior&quot;. The clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa (1866), also had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.

=== First battles between ironclads: the U.S. Civil War ===
The first use of ironclads in combat came in the U.S. Civil War. The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads, its most powerful ships being six unarmored steam-powered frigates. Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union, the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships. In May 1861, the Confederate Congress appropriated $2 million dollars for the purchase of ironclads from overseas, and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships.

On 12 October 1861, became the first ironclad to enter combat, when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of Passes. She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting. In February 1862, the larger joined the Confederate Navy, having been rebuilt at Norfolk. Constructed on the hull of , &quot;Virginia&quot; originally was a conventional warship made of wood, but she was converted into an iron-covered casemate ironclad gunship, when she entered the Confederate Navy. By this time, the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the , and was about to complete , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson. The Union was also building a large armored frigate, , and the smaller .
The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862, as the armored &quot;Monitor&quot; was deployed to protect the Union&#x27;s wooden fleet from the ironclad ram &quot;Virginia&quot; and other Confederate warships. In this engagement, the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the two ironclads tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor. The battle attracted attention worldwide, making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date, with the ironclads destroying them easily.

The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides, and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships, commerce raiders and blockade runners. The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake. The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of &quot;Virginia&quot;, many of which saw action, but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy – especially in Russia, the only country to openly support the Union through the war. Only CSS &quot;Stonewall&quot; was completed, and she arrived in Cuban waters just in time for the end of the war.

Through the remainder of the war, ironclads saw action in the Union&#x27;s attacks on Confederate ports. Seven Union monitors, including , as well as two other ironclads, the armored frigate &quot;New Ironsides&quot; and a light-draft , participated in the failed attack on Charleston; one was sunk. Two small ironclads, and participated in the defense of the harbor. For the later attack at Mobile Bay, the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships, facing the , the Confederacy&#x27;s most powerful ironclad, and three gunboats.
On the western front, the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads, beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer James Eads of St. Louis, Missouri to build the City-class ironclads. These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel, all protected by an armored casemate. They had a shallow draft, allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries, and were very well suited for river operations. Eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers, the first two of which differed from the ocean-going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel ( and ).

The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts, installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire. They were not as heavily armored as the ocean-going monitors of the Union, but they were adequate for their intended use. More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes (mines) than by enemy fire, and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations, not Confederate vessels.

=== Lissa: first fleet battle ===

The first fleet battle, and the first ocean battle, involving ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866. Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of Navarino and Tsushima.

The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships, escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa. Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates, four smaller ironclads, and the newly built  – a double-turreted ram. Opposing them, the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates.

The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the melée which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.

The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads, and , while the Austrian unarmored screw two-decker remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads. The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years, and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic.

The battles of the American Civil War and at Lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed. In particular, it taught a generation of naval officers the (ultimately erroneous) lesson that ramming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads.

== Armament and tactics ==
The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless, since their shot would bounce off an armored hull. To penetrate armor, increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships; nevertheless, the view that ramming was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread. The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside, in the manner of a ship-of-the-line, towards a handful of guns in turrets for all-round fire.

=== Ram craze ===
From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the ram was again a vital weapon in naval warfare. With steam power freeing ships from the wind, iron construction increasing their structural strength, and armor making them invulnerable to shellfire, the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow.

The scant damage inflicted by the guns of &quot;Monitor&quot; and &quot;Virginia&quot; at Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS &quot;Erzherzog Ferdinand Max&quot; sinking the Italian &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot; at Lissa gave strength to the ramming craze. From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram. Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard.

The revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.

The ram finally fell out of favor in the 1880s, as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo, with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns.

=== Development of naval guns ===

The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech-loading versus muzzle-loading.

 carried a mixture of 110-pounder breech-loading rifles and more traditional 68-pounder smoothbore guns. &quot;Warrior&quot; highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament; the breech-loaders she carried, designed by Sir William Armstrong, were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy, but were shortly withdrawn from service.

Breech-loading guns seemed to offer important advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re-aimed. &quot;Warrior&quot;″s Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.

The weakness of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. &quot;Warrior&quot;″s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the armor of &quot;Gloire&quot;, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.

These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of the 100-pounder or smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed , the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178 mm) rifled guns, weighing . These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons—guns weighing , , , and finally , with caliber increasing from 8 inches (203 mm) to 16 inches (406 mm).

The decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticized by historians. However, at least until the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as the first Armstrong guns.

From 1875 onwards, the balance between breech- and muzzle-loading changed. Captain de Bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech, adopted by the French in 1873. Just as compellingly, the growing size of naval guns and consequently, their ammunition, made muzzle-loading much more complicated. With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for reloading, or even reloading by hand, and complicated hydraulic systems were required for reloading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire. In 1882, the 81-ton, 16-inch guns of fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the Urabi Revolt. The , 450 mm (17.72 inch) guns of the could each fire a round every 15 minutes.

In the Royal Navy, the switch to breech-loaders was finally made in 1879; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance, opinion was swayed by an explosion on board caused by a gun being double-loaded, a problem which could only happen with a muzzle-loading gun.

The caliber and weight of guns could only increase so far. The larger the gun, the slower it would be to load, the greater the stresses on the ship&#x27;s hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibers of gun ever used at sea. carried two 16.25-inch (413 mm) breech-loading guns, each weighing . A few years afterwards, the Italians used 450 mm (17.72 inch) muzzle-loading guns on the &quot;Duilio&quot; class ships. One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as &#x27;floating weapons-platform&#x27; could negate the advantage of rifling. American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least &#x27;skip&#x27; along the surface of the water. Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail—though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds. Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the &#x27;Age of the Ironclad&#x27; were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the maximum reach of their ships&#x27; guns.

Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.

The development of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in caliber compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12 in (305 mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.

The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of chilled iron, a harder iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the armor-piercing shell was developed.

=== Positioning of armament ===

==== Broadside ironclads ====
The first British, French and Russian ironclads, in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line, carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called &quot;broadside ironclads&quot;. Both and were examples of this type. Because their armor was so heavy, they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck.

A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.

Broadside armament also had disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.

==== Turrets, batteries, and barbettes ====

There were two main design alternatives to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the &#x27;box-battery&#x27; or &#x27;center-battery&#x27;. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.

The centre-battery was the simpler and, during the 1860s and 1870s, the more popular method. Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type. The first full-scale center-battery ship was of 1865; the French laid down centre-battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870. Centre-battery ships often, but not always, had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead.

The turret was first used in naval combat on in 1862, with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson&#x27;s turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles&#x27;s turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire for the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage—and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard &quot;Monitor&quot; and the broadside sailor HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; represented two opposite extremes in what an &#x27;Ironclad&#x27; was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or &#x27;squaring this circle&#x27;, was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: . It was a dangerously low freeboard turret ship, which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail and subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was of 1876, which carried two turrets on either side of the center-line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.

A lighter alternative to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor. Some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and with the addition of an armored &#x27;gun-house&#x27;, transformed into the turrets of the pre-dreadnought battleships.

=== Torpedoes ===
The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static mines, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo, an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–1865, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or &#x27;Harvey&#x27; torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.

A more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or Whitehead torpedo. Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, it formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot; and the Italian . The ironclad&#x27;s vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the school of naval thought; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the &quot;Jeune Ecole&quot; was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.

== Armor and construction ==
The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls, and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking. Ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s.

=== Hulls: iron, wood, and steel ===
Using wrought iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising warships.

Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.

The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design, for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. &quot;Warrior&quot;, built of iron, was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled &quot;Gloire&quot;. Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of seasoning. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.

Wooden hulls continued to be used for long-range and smaller ironclads, because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage. Iron hulls suffered quick fouling by marine life, slowing the ships down—manageable for a European battlefleet close to dry docks, but a difficulty for long-range ships. The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper, a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive. Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable: the Japanese and ordered in 1875 were sister-ships, but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction.

After 1872, steel started to be introduced as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. &quot;Redoutable&quot; nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.

Even though Britain led the world in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The Bessemer process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels &quot;Iris&quot; and &quot;Mercury&quot;, laid down in 1875 and 1876.

=== Armor and protection schemes ===
Iron-built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme. HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; was protected by 4.5 in (114 mm) of wrought iron backed by 15 in (381 mm) of teak, the strongest shipbuilding wood. The wood played two roles, preventing spalling and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship. Later, wood and iron were combined in &#x27;sandwich&#x27; armor, for instance in HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot;.

Steel was also an obvious material for armor. It was tested in the 1860s, but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells. Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates, giving a form of compound armor. This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s, first for turret armor (starting with HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot;) and then for all armor (starting with of 1882). The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately, with licenses being given for the use of the &#x27;Wilson System&#x27; of producing fused armor.

The first ironclads to have all-steel armor were the two ships of the &quot;Duilio&quot; class. Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877. The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet, but found it limited in supply, so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor. Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889.

The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel-steel. In 1890, the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor. For several years &#x27;Harvey steel&#x27; was the state of the art, produced in the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy. In 1894, the German firm Krupp developed gas cementing, which further hardened steel armor. The German , laid down in 1895, was the first ship to benefit from the new &#x27;Krupp armor&#x27; and the new armor was quickly adopted; the Royal Navy using it from , laid down in 1896. By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor, though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade.

The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows: 15 in (381 mm) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in (305 mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75 in (197 mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75 in (146 mm) of Krupp armor.

Ironclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and &#x27;all-or-nothing&#x27; armor design. &quot;Warrior&quot; was only semi-armored, and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern. As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns, the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished. &quot;Inflexible&quot;″s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships, protecting boilers and engines, turrets and magazines, and little else. An ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of damage to her un-armored sections.

== Propulsion: steam and sail ==

The first ocean-going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned. Early steam engines were inefficient; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry &quot;5 to 9 days coal&quot;, and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. &quot;Warrior&quot; also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail (though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level.
Ships designed for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, was the first large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean. The &quot;Devastation&quot; and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.

During the 1860s, steam engines improved with the adoption of double-expansion steam engines, which used 30–40% less coal than earlier models. The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871, and by 1875 they were widespread. However, this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast. Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails, or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation, is a matter of debate. A steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide, which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands. Just as significantly, because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines, the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory.
During the 1870s the distinction grew between &#x27;first-class ironclads&#x27; or &#x27;battleships&#x27; on the one hand, and &#x27;cruising ironclads&#x27; designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.

Sails persisted on &#x27;cruising ironclads&#x27; for much longer. During the 1860s, the French navy had produced the and es as small, long-range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like of 1870. The Russian ship , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875, was a model of a fast, long-range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like &quot;Swiftsure&quot;. Even the later , often described as the first British armored cruiser, would have been too slow to outrun &quot;General-Admiral&quot;. While &quot;Shannon&quot; was the last British ship with a retractable propeller, later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig, sacrificing speed under steam in consequence. It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long-range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders, , which was completed in 1888. While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s, rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century.

The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the middle of the first decade of the Twentieth Century.

== Fleets ==
While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide, there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads. Most European nations settled differences on land, and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France, while providing suitable protection to Britain&#x27;s commerce and colonial outposts worldwide. Ironclads remained, for the British Royal Navy, a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second. Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers. But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention, from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as Kronstadt and Cherbourg.

There were many types of ironclads:
* Seagoing ships intended to &quot;stand in the line of battle&quot;; the precursors of the battleship
* Coastal service and riverine vessels, including &#x27;floating batteries&#x27; and &#x27;monitors&#x27;
* Vessels intended for commerce raiding or protection of commerce, called &quot;armored cruisers&quot;

=== Navies ===
The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period. The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of &#x27;coast-defense battleships&#x27;, starting with the &quot;Devastation&quot; class. These &#x27;breastwork monitors&#x27; were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War.

The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to &#x27;overwhelm&#x27; enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running artillery gauntlets. Mines and obstructions negated these advantages—a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough &quot;Devastation&quot;-class &#x27;battleships&#x27; to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act, which promulgated the idea of a &#x27;two-power standard&#x27;, that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.

British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy&#x27;s ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed &#x27;Urabi&#x27;s Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy&#x27;s sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.

The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech-loading weapons and steel construction, the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would be the future of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco-Prussian War was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.

Russia built a number of ironclads, generally copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there were real innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser, &quot;General-Admiral&quot; of the 1870s, and a set of unusual but moderately-successful circular battleships referred to as &quot;popovkas&quot; (for Admiral Popov, who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy. Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905.
The US Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve, leaving the United States virtually without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the US from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.
Ironclads were widely used in South America. Both sides used ironclads in the Chincha Islands War between Spain and the combined forces of Peru and Chile in the early 1860s. The powerful Spanish participated in the Battle of Callao but was unable to inflict significant damage upon the Callao defences. Besides, Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs, &quot;Loa&quot; (a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad) and (a small monitor armed with a single 68-pdr gun), as well as two British-built ironclads: , a centre-battery ship, and the turret ship . &quot;Numancia&quot;, was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world under the command of Juan Bautista Antequera y Bobadilla de Eslava, arriving in Cádiz on 20 September 1867, and earning the motto: &quot;Enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit&quot; [&quot;First ironclad ship to sail around the world&quot;]). In the War of the Pacific in 1879, both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships, including some of those used a few years previously against Spain. While &quot;Independencia&quot; ran aground early on, the Peruvian ironclad made a great impact against Chilean shipping, delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months. She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centre-battery ironclads, and at the Battle of Angamos Point.
Ironclads were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). (Japanese: 甲鉄, literally &quot;Ironclad&quot;, later renamed Azuma 東, &quot;East&quot;) had a decisive role in the Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay in May 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War, and the complete establishment of the Meiji Restoration. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later armored cruisers. These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the Yalu River. Thanks to superior short-range firepower, the Japanese fleet came off better, sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four. The naval war was concluded the next year at the Battle of Weihaiwei, where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese.

== End of the ironclad warship ==

There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad, besides the transition from wood hulls to all-metal. Ironclads continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions &#x27;battleship&#x27; and &#x27;armored cruiser&#x27; came to replace the term &#x27;ironclad&#x27;.

The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the pre-dreadnought. These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the dreadnought, is never referred to as an &#x27;ironclad&#x27;.

<text>Odalys García (; born October 23, 1975) is a Cuban actress, model, singer and television presenter.

García, born in Havana, Cuba, started by participating in dance demonstrations by the age of eight. At nine, she was admitted to the Alicia Alonso School of Ballet.

When Odalys was 13, she arrived in Miami, where she began a career in modeling. In 1991, she was cast to host &quot;Noche de Gigantes&quot; (&quot;Night of the Giants&quot;) by Univision, alongside Don Francisco. Garcia and Don Francisco became friends during the two years she was in the show, and she started to become famous to Hispanic audiences with her voluptuous figure.

Soon, she was chosen to host &quot;De Pelicula&quot;, a Saturday afternoon movies show. But her biggest break came in 1993, when she was chosen to participate in &quot;Lente Loco&quot; (&quot;Crazy Lens&quot;), as Pupu Pirú, a show that was like a Spanish version of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;. &quot;Lente Loco&quot; became a big hit among Univision&#x27;s target audiences, and Odalys&#x27; fame went off the roof. Within years, she was producing calendars, being the object of romance rumors by many magazines, and becoming the spokeswoman of Columbia House&#x27;s &quot;Club Musica Latina&quot;. She also had the opportunity to act in a Spanish soap opera, named &quot;Morelia&quot;, and she was disc jockey at a morning radio show at Florida&#x27;s station, WQBA. She is also a spokeswoman for Bally Total Fitness.

Odalys García is also an executive producer and singer. Her calendars have sold well over the years, her 2001 version selling 200,000 copies, and she also produces a video to accompany her calendars.

<doc id="251507" wikidata="Q7688846" url="?curid=251507" title="Tauranga campaign">
<text>The Tauranga campaign was a six-month-long armed conflict in New Zealand&#x27;s Bay of Plenty in early 1864, and part of the New Zealand Wars that were fought over issues of land ownership and sovereignty. The campaign was a sequel to the invasion of Waikato, which aimed to crush the Māori King (Kingitanga) Movement that was viewed by the colonial government as a challenge to the supremacy of the British monarchy.

British forces suffered a humiliating defeat in the Battle of Gate Pā on 29 April 1864, with 31 killed and 80 wounded despite outnumbering their Māori foe, but saved face seven weeks later by routing their enemy at the Battle of Te Ranga, in which more than 100 Māori were killed or fatally wounded, including their commander, Rawiri Puhirake.

==Background==
In late January 1864 British commander General Duncan Cameron—at the time still facing the intimidating Paterangi line of Māori defences in the Waikato campaign—despatched by sea an expedition to occupy Tauranga, through which he believed his enemy were transporting men and supplies from the East Coast. The local Ngāi Te Rangi Māori were hostile to the government, a major gunpowder store was known to be inland of Tauranga and the district was an important source of food for Māori fighting British forces in the Waikato. While Colonel Henry Greer was landed with his force at Te Papa, where they built two redoubts, Captain Robert Jenkins, commander of HMS &quot;Miranda&quot;, was ordered to blockade the harbour to prevent the arrival of more Māori reinforcements.

Though Cameron&#x27;s strategy gained the enthusiastic support of Premier Frederick Whitaker and his cabinet, who were keen to use the 1863 confiscations legislation to open fresh territory for European settlement, Governor George Grey was opposed, fearing it would raise rebellion in more Māori tribes, including those that had thus far refrained from supporting the Kingitanga movement. Grey withdrew his initial assent for Whitaker&#x27;s orders to take an aggressive stance and instead directed the Tauranga expedition&#x27;s commander, Brigadier George Carey, to remain strictly on the defensive, apart from intercepting armed bands en route to the Waikato.

Alerted to their arrival, Ngāi Te Rangi warriors returned from the Waikato battlefields and built a hilltop fort, or &quot;pā&quot;, on high ground at Te Waoku near the Waimapu Stream overlooking the Bay of Plenty, where they established a garrison of about 100 men. Ngāi Te Rangi chief Rawiri Puhirake taunted Carey in a letter, challenging him to fight, then in April 1864 moved closer to the British base to occupy to a new ridge-top position at Pukehinahina, a locality known to Europeans as &quot;The Gate&quot; because of the presence of a post-and-rail fence and gateway used by Māori to block Pākehā trespassers. The new fortification, which became known as the &quot;Gate Pā&quot;, was built just 5 km from imperial troops, who were prohibited by Grey&#x27;s orders from intervening. Puhirake, finding it increasingly difficult to keep his force together without a battle in prospect, again attempted to goad the British into action.

Meanwhile, fighting had already broken out nearby. A large contingent of East Coast Māori, possibly as many as 700 warriors, were making their way towards the conflict at Waikato. Their route took them through the territory of another tribe which saw themselves as allies of the Pākehā, the Arawa tribe based around Rotorua. Forewarned of this, the Arawa chiefs called back their tribesmen, many of whom were working in Auckland or further north. Pausing in Tauranga to borrow guns from the British, they hastened onward to Rotorua. Four hundred warriors of the tribe were mobilised and they met and held the East Coast Māori on 7 April in a two-day battle on the shores of Lake Rotoiti. On 27 April fighting broke out again on the coast, with Māori loyal to the Crown supported by the 43rd Regiment and British corvettes firing on Kingite Māori as they were pursued through the sand dunes.

==Battle of Gate Pā==
Still hoping to provoke an attack, the 250 Ngāi Te Rangi fighters at Pukehinahina enlarged the existing trench and banks and transformed the pā into a system of two redoubts, including a honeycomb of &quot;rua&quot;, or anti-artillery bunkers. Ngāi Te Rangi garrisoned the main redoubt, and about 30 members of the Ngāti Koheriki &quot;hapu&quot; and another 10 men from Piri-Rikau and other &quot;hapu&quot; manned the smaller redoubt. With timber scarce in surrounding swampland, palisading was frail, but the location of the redoubt on a hilltop, and the total span of the palisading gave their enemy the impression of greater strength than it actually possessed. In all, the total garrison of Gate Pā was about 230 men.

On 5 April, Cameron abandoned hope of pursuing Ngāti Hauā leader and prominent Kingite Wiremu Tamihana after his foe evacuated the besieged Te Tiki o te Ihingarangi pā near Lake Karapiro. Cameron switched his attention to Tauranga, arriving there on 21 April in and established his headquarters at Tauranga. In addition to the reinforcements on &quot;Esk&quot;, more from Auckland arrived on . Within days Cameron decided he had sufficient forces to finally march against Gate Pā.

On the afternoon of 28 April, Cameron launched an hour-long attack on the front of Gate Pā with four batteries of artillery placed at a range of between 350 and 800 metres. The battery—the heaviest used in the wars of 1863–1864—included a 110-pounder Armstrong gun, two 40-pounder and two six-pounder Armstrongs, two 24-pounder howitzers, two eight-inch mortars, and six Coehorn mortars. According to accounts by Hēni Te Kiri Karamū and Hōri Ngātai, the first victims of the British cannon shots were Church of England ministers conducting prayers.

Late in the night Greer moved his 700 men from the 68th Regiment across swamps to the east of Gate Pā under cover of darkness and rain to take up a position to the rear of the redoubt to cut off a Māori retreat. Those forces were joined by a detachment of the Naval Brigade from the warships &quot;Esk, Falcon&quot; and . By daybreak on 29 April Cameron had a total of about 1650 men surrounding the pā: 700 of the 68th Regiment, 420 from the Naval Brigade, 300 of the 43rd Regiment, 50 Royal Artillery, and another 180 members of the 12th, 14th, 40th and 65th Regiments.

At first light on 29 April the assembled guns and mortars opened fire again, this time maintaining the bombardment for more than eight hours. They destroyed the palisade and completely suppressed Māori gunfire. An estimated 30 tonnes of shell and shot were dropped on or near the Māori position, killing about 15 of the defenders.
At about 4pm, with no sign of life in the pā, Cameron ordered an assault by 300 men—a combined force of Naval Brigade under Commander Hay and the 43rd Regiment, led by Lieutenant-Colonel H.G. Booth—who ran in four abreast with fixed bayonets. Another 300 men followed at a distance as a reserve. Some in the initial British assault force were shot as they entered the main pā, and inside the redoubt more fell as they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Māori armed with shotguns and mere (short clubs). A lull of about five minutes occurred, during which time Captain G.R. Greaves, who was with the leading files of the assault party, left the pā and reported to Cameron that the redoubt had been captured and that British casualties were light.

But minutes later, as the rear of the pā was breached by the 68th Regiment, all changed. In a sequence of events that is still unclear, fierce fighting erupted, taking a heavy toll on the invaders and panicked British forces began streaming out of the pā. Historian James Cowan wrote: &quot;More than a hundred of the assaulting column were casualties, and the glacis and the interior of the pā were strewn with dead or dying. The Maori suffered too, but not severely.&quot; Thirty-one of the British force died, including 10 officers, while 80 were wounded. At least 25–30 Māori were killed or missing.
Several theories exist to explain the British stampede from the pā. A contemporary report by a seaman in the pā suggested that the flood of soldiers from the 68th Regiment at the rear was mistaken for Māori reinforcements. Historian James Belich has postulated that the bulk of the Māori garrison remained concealed in camouflaged bunkers as the British forces stormed the pā, before unleashing waves of heavy volleys from close range on the British, who were almost standing on their hidden foes. Belich cites descriptions of the main redoubt as being &quot;like ratholes everywhere, with covered ways and underground chambers&quot; and notes that Rawiri Puhirake ordered defenders to &quot;not utter a word or fire a shot till the proper time came for the order&quot;. Belich claims that by providing only a feeble defence from the garrison during the storming of the pā and keeping his garrison hidden, Rawiri Puhirake employed a &quot;remarkable tactical ploy ... brilliantly implemented as well as brilliantly conceived&quot; to lure the British into a deadly trap.

As night fell, the Gate Pā garrison, assuming the site would be stormed the next morning, evacuated their position, passing through the lines of the 68th Regiment and fleeing across surrounding swamps before dispersing.

===Reaction to British defeat===
Gate Pā was the single most devastating defeat suffered by the British military in the New Zealand Wars: while British casualties totalled more than a third of the storming party, Māori losses are generally unknown but thought to number at least 25–30, including Ngāi Te Rangi chiefs Te Reweti, Eru Puhirake, Tikitu, Te Kani, Te Rangihau, and Te Wharepouri, and Te Urungawera chief Te Kau. Te Moana-nui and Te Ipu were among the wounded, estimated at at least 25–30. To contemporaries Gate Pā was seen as a shattering and humiliating defeat, with one newspaper noting that the &quot;gallant&quot; force had been &quot;trampled in the dust ... by a horde of half-naked, half-armed savages&quot;. 

Grey, horrified by the disaster, began exploring ways to limit the extent of land confiscations and thus reduce Māori resistance. Grey visited Tauranga on 12 May to confer with Cameron and engaged some neutral Māori to act as intermediaries with the Kingites to negotiate a peace agreement.

Three days later, on 15 May, Cameron advised Grey he had decided to cease aggressive operations in Tauranga; the following day he left for Auckland with 700 men, leaving Greer in command of Te Papa with instructions to remain strictly on the defensive. On 20 May the Māori mediators reported that the Kingites were willing to surrender their arms &quot;if they can have full claims over their lands and the Governor will promise to see that no harm befalls them&quot;. By early June several Ngāi Te Rangi warriors had handed in their guns and naval commodore William Wiseman reported to London that hostilities in the area had ceased.

==Battle of Te Ranga==
Despite government hopes of peace, Kingite forces—newly reinforced by &quot;hapu&quot; of Ngāti Pikiao, from Rotoiti, as well as a Ngati-Porou war party from the East Cape and commanded by Hoera te Mataatai—decided in June to again challenge the British forces. They selected Te Ranga, a steep but flat-topped ridge about 5 km from Gate Pā, and began working on entrenchments and rifle pits to cut off a bush track.

On 21 June Greer, leading a reconnaissance patrol of about 600 men of the 43rd and 68th Regiments and 1st Waikato Militia, came upon the 500-strong Māori force labouring on Te Ranga&#x27;s defences. Knowing any delay would allow his foe to strengthen their defences, Greer chose to launch an immediate attack. He sent back to Te Papa for reinforcements, then deployed his men to fan out and open fire on the pā&#x27;s outposts and trenches. As the reinforcements—220 men including cavalry and one Armstrong gun—arrived two hours later, he ordered a charge on Te Ranga. The Māori responded to the ferocity of the advance of British bayonets with double-barrelled shotguns, but had little time to reload and were forced to fight hand-to-hand with &quot;mere&quot;. Between 83 and 120 Māori were killed or fatally wounded, half of them with bayonets; Gate Pā commander Rawiri Puhirake was among the dead. His death prompted the survivors to flee. Thirteen privates of the 43rd and 68th Regiments were killed in the battle, and six officers and 33 non-commissioned officers and privates wounded.

Settlers celebrated the success at Te Ranga, the last serious engagement of the Tauranga campaign, as &quot;by far the most brilliant achievement obtained throughout the whole war&quot;. Coming so soon after the humiliating defeat at Gate Pā, they viewed it as a satisfying act of revenge that reclaimed the honour of the troops. But Cameron, who was showing an increasing distaste for the war against a foe among whom he found more courage and chivalry than among the colonists, remained steadfast in his opposition to further aggressive actions.

One hundred and thirty-three Ngāi Te Rangi warriors surrendered to the British on 24 July. By 29 August the entire tribe with the exception of one &quot;hapu&quot;—36 members of Piri Rakau—had followed suit. The tribe gave up some of land and 81 guns, although they still retained a number of firearms in their possession.

==Aftermath==
Piri Rakau, the Waikato &quot;hapu&quot; that refused to surrender in 1864, fled into the hills behind Tauranga where they lived in hiding at Kuranui. With them were Ngati Porou followers of the Pai Mārire religious cult who arrived in exile about 1869 and Kuranui became a place of sanctuary for many people of different tribal origins. The community gave support to Te Kooti when he ventured north to Matamata in early 1870. Te Kooti, having been rebuffed by King Tāwhiao in western Waikato and the King Country, was trying to lay claim to the eastern Waikato. Two Arawa hapu also joined Te Kooti&#x27;s rebels, but Tauranga Māori were anxious not to renew the war in Tauranga and distanced themselves from Te Kooti. Chief Tana Taingakawa, Wiremu Tamihana&#x27;s son from Ngati Haua, wrote to Colonel Moule urging him not to fight Te Kooti in his land.

<text>Peñuelas (, ) is a town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the Peñuelas Valley on the southern coast of the island, south of Adjuntas, east of Guayanilla, west of Ponce and north of the Caribbean Sea. Peñuelas is spread over 12 barrios and Peñuelas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area. Peñuelas is known as &quot; (The Güiro Capital) and &quot; (The Valley of the Royal Poinciana trees). In 2020, Peñuelas had a population of 20,399.

==History==
In 1754, a group of workers had settled over the Bay of Tallaboa. Later gradually retreated deeper into the valley, heading tobarrios the most fertile land which would then be part of the town of Peñuelas. For the year 1788, approximately 80 families inhabiting the valley, which focused mainly on agriculture and livestock.
Peñuelas Township was founded August 25, 1793 by Diego de Alvarado.

By 1874, the town had been developed and had a population of 9,206, according to a census of that year. The town had four main roads, some streets, a brick church and the town hall, which also served as a prison, barracks and a cemetery.

On March 1, 1902 the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved a law to consolidate certain municipal districts, so Peñuelas neighborhoods were attached to the municipality of Ponce. In 1905, the same Assembly repealed the law and Peñuelas became once again a municipality.

The first incident of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolt of 1950 occurred during the early hours of October 29, 1950 in Peñuelas when the insular police of that town surrounded the house of the mother of Melitón Muñiz Santos, the president of the Peñuelas chapter of the Nationalist Party in the &quot;barrio&quot; Macaná, under the pretext that he was storing weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired upon the Nationalists in the house and a firefight between both factions ensued, which resulted in the death of two Nationalists and the wounding of six police officers. Nationalists Melitón Muñiz Santos, Roberto Jaume Rodríguez, Estanislao Lugo Santiago, Marcelino Turell, William Gutiérrez and Marcelino Berríos were arrested and accused of participating in an ambush against the local insular police.&quot;

<doc id="251512" wikidata="Q5238211" url="?curid=251512" title="David Oldfield (politician)">
<text>David Ernest Oldfield (born 25 June 1958) is an Australian former politician who co-founded and was national director of the Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation party.

Oldfield was initially involved in politics as a member of Manly Council, a Liberal candidate for Manly and a political advisor to then-Liberal Party minister (and future Prime Minister of Australia), Tony Abbott. He later became acquainted with parliamentary newcomer Pauline Hanson, who in the wake of her election to the Australian House of Representatives gained notoriety for comments about Indigenous Australians, Asians, immigration and multiculturalism. While working for Abbott, Oldfield began to construct Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation. One Nation was formed in 1997, and Oldfield was appointed an informal deputy leader, serving with David Ettridge.

The structural basis of One Nation was orchestrated solely by Ettridge and Oldfield, who acted as the policy masterminds behind Pauline Hanson&#x27;s image and political style. However, in 2000 Oldfield was expelled from One Nation after a dispute with Hanson and formed the splinter group One Nation NSW, serving as its leader from its creation in 2000, to its dissolution in 2004.

Oldfield was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1999 to 2007, under One Nation, One Nation NSW and briefly as an independent twice. In 2006, Oldfield announced that he would not recontest the 2007 New South Wales election.

He formerly hosted radio programs on radio 2UE and radio 2GB.
On 19 February 2018, David and wife Lisa joined the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot;.

==Early life and education==
David Oldfield is the 4th and youngest child of June Emma ( 1930—present) and Ernest Radcliffe &quot;Bill&quot; Oldfield (1918–2008). His uncle, Edward Peate &quot;Ted&quot; Oldfield was a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1951 to 1965, representing Maylands between 1951 and 1956, Mount Lawley between 1956 and 1962, and Maylands again from 1962 to 1965. He first represented Maylands as a Liberal, before contesting Mount Lawley as an Independent, and returning to Maylands under Labor. His paternal grandparents, Lena Eva (&quot;née&quot; Peate) was a housewife, and Ernest Henry was a Commercial traveller.

Oldfield was born and raised in Manly, a beachside suburb of Sydney. His mother was a small business proprietor during Oldfield&#x27;s childhood. His father, Ernest Radcliffe enlisted to serve in World War II. He joined the Australian Army in 1939 and was transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force in 1940. He was assigned to the No. 2 Squadron and achieved the rank of Flight lieutenant before becoming a prisoner of war when the Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber carrying his crew crash landed due to engine complications, 20 yards off the coast of Sumba Island, Indonesia, where they were captured by Japanese forces on 27 April 1945. The crew was rescued and returned to Australia in 1946, and Ernest Oldfield was promoted to flight sergeant and was awarded a Distinguished Flying Medal for courage... In later years, Ernest Oldfield became the CEO of Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd, a pioneering company of the household goods industry in Australia (known for their creation of cleaning products such as Mr Sheen and Mortein).

==Business career, 1984–1993==
After graduating from Balgowah, Oldfield founded Fathom Dive Pty Ltd in 1984, a Sporting goods retailer specializing in water sports, based in Farlight near Manly Beach. Fathom was also a diving academy and operated recreational underwater diving expeditions, exploring underwater off the coast of New South Wales.

On 8 January 1988, a drowning occurred on the boat and the equipment hired from Fathom to explore of the wreck of the S.S. Annie M. Miller, near the Sydney South Head. His clients Dr. Andy Newman-Maurice and Richard Evans, who were holidaying in Sydney from Melbourne. Evans died during the exploration, and the Coroner&#x27;s inquest found that it was an &quot;accidental death by drowning&quot;. In September 1993, A court case was brought against Fathom by Evan&#x27;s family in the Victorian Supreme Court. Oldfield represented himself, and after 11 days the jury was discharged by consent.

==Political career, 1990–2007==
===Entry into politics (1990–1996)===

By 1990, Oldfield was a member of the Liberal Party. He was elected an Alderman of the Manly Municipal Council in September 1991, and while his activity while on the Council remains largely unpublished and unknown, he was a known member of the Environmental Works Community Audit Committee (1993—1995) and the Fisher Road Special School Committee (1994—1996). When Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation was founded, Oldfield became the first representative of the party on a Local government level. He remained an Alderman of the Council until 1998 when he resigned to stand for the Australian Senate.

In April 1994, Oldfield was assigned to the parliamentary staff of Tony Abbott, who was appointed Parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Education (later becoming a senior Minister in the Howard government, and also Prime Minister of Australia from 2013 to 2015). Abbott had been elected at a March by-election that same year for the Division of Warringah, based in Manly. Abbott had approached Oldfield by phone to discuss his preselection for the seat and asked for Oldfield&#x27;s influence in the Manly area to help Abbott secure this position. He later visited Oldfield&#x27;s office to discuss further matters, which was likely to have involved Oldfield&#x27;s position on Abbott&#x27;s staff. When Abbott won the seat, he made Oldfield his principal advisor, which built Oldfield&#x27;s influence in the Liberal Party.

In late 1994, Oldfield won the Liberal preselection for the Electoral district of Manly. At the 1995 state election, Oldfield fell 243 votes short of winning the seat from Independent Peter Macdonald. Despite the marginal number of votes required to win the seat, only a nominal swing of 0.3 was achieved. Oldfield received 16,433 votes (49.6%) in the Two-party-preferred result, while Macdonald received 16,676 votes (50.4%) in the Two-party-preferred result. Oldfield did not contest the next preselection battle for the seat.

===Rise to power (1996–1999)===
Pauline Hanson was endorsed in November 1995 as the Liberal candidate for the Division of Oxley. She was elected to Parliament at the 1996 federal election as an Independent. Her maiden speech, outlining her right-wing views on race, her appeal to economically disadvantaged White Australians and her dissatisfaction with government policy on indigenous affairs had caught the attention of Oldfield.

====Founding of One Nation====

In September 1996, on the night of Hanson&#x27;s maiden speech, Oldfield contacted Hanson to arrange a meeting at a Canberra tavern where they discussed how the growing support for Hanson would be handled. Oldfield, at this point, was still working for Tony Abbott. They continued their meetings, privately, for a number of weeks, which continued to an encounter in December 1996 at a Canberra motel, where they had sex. Oldfield had previously denied that he had engaged in sexual activities with Hanson until he conceded after a lie-detector test. However, he continues to deny that there was any &#x27;romance&#x27;. After the affair, Oldfield publicly resigned from Tony Abbott&#x27;s staff. John Pasquarelli, Hanson&#x27;s Chief of Staff and Principal Adviser since March 1996, was fired, and Oldfield took his position.

Oldfield had previously been in contact with David Ettridge, a professional fundraiser from Adelaide, discussing the prospect of establishing a political party. In February 1997, in a meeting at a Sydney hotel, Oldfield, Ettridge, and Hanson came to the agreement that a political party would be formed.

The name &#x27;One Nation&#x27; was chosen to signify their aim of national unity in Australia, reflecting Hanson&#x27;s view that the country was becoming increasingly divided by government policies which supposedly favoured migrants and Aboriginal Australians. The term had previously been used for an economic program created by Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1992. The policies strengthening relations with Asia, the Free Market, and social welfare were the opposite of that of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation.

=====Early electoral success=====

On 11 April 1997, Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation was launched in Ipswich, Queensland, in the George Hogg Auditorium of the Ipswich Civic Centre, filled to capacity with over 400 party faithful. The launch was also attended by supporters of the Australian Democrats, Labor and the Coalition, and was notably attended by Paul Filing, the Independent Member for Moore, Western Australia, who considered joining the party. Several executive members, including Oldfield, Ettridge, and Hanson received a police escort into the venue, due to the demonstration of over 200 protesters, led by Ipswich City Councillor Paul Tully. Most protesters were involved in left-wing student politics at Griffith University. In her speech, Hanson spoke out against the racial discrimination policy in Australia, religious monasticism, and addressed the danger of a civil war in Australia, fabricated through racial division and inequality.

By October 1997, an A C Nielsen-McNair poll showed that 27% of Queensland voters would vote for One Nation, and a national poll showed that the party could win up to 12 Senate seats.

Both Oldfield and Ettridge went to extreme lengths to secure the party&#x27;s survival, forcing members to prematurely sign resignation forms, disendorsing anyone who refused to do so, as well as disendorsing members who disagreed with the party constitution. Due to this behaviour, perceived as almost authoritarian, the Australian public came to view Hanson as a puppet, and that Oldfield and Ettridge held the true power within the party.

=====1998 Queensland election=====

One Nation achieved its peak of support in the 1998 Queensland state election. By October 1997, an A C Nielsen-McNair poll showed that 27% of Queensland voters would vote for One Nation. The party won 22.7% of the vote, behind only Labor, winning 11 seats in the unicameral Legislative Assembly in the June 1998 election. In terms of first-preference votes, One Nation received more than either the Liberals or Nationals; its vote share was high enough to render any attempt to calculate a two-party preferred vote meaningless. However, since One Nation&#x27;s vote was spread out across the state, this was only good enough for 11 of 89 seats and fourth place in the legislature (behind Labor, the Liberals, and Nationals). This was still enough to deny Labor a majority, as seven of One Nation&#x27;s seats would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. Queensland Labor leader Peter Beattie secured 45-seat majority and the premiership with the vote of Independent Peter Wellington.

However, in November of the same year, One Nation MLA Charles Rappolt resigned from parliament due to increasing media pressure against him, after his partner sought legal action due to spousal abuse. This triggered a by-election in the seat of Mulgrave, which was won by Labor&#x27;s Warren Pitt, allowing them to secure a majority in their own right.

Besides the Rappolt resignation, the support for One Nation continued uninterrupted until early 1999.

====Deputy president; leading One Nation in New South Wales====
Oldfield, from the launch of the party, was its state leader in New South Wales, and was the vice president of the party federally, alongside David Ettridge. Oldfield became the sole vice president when Ettridge left the party in early 2000 to return to the private sector. He was the lead senate candidate in New South Wales for One Nation at the 1998 federal election, where he fell short of achieving the quota required. Nationally, One Nation gained 8.99 percent of the Senate vote and 8.4% of the Representatives vote, but only one MP was elected – Len Harris (politician) as a Senator for Queensland. Heather Hill had been elected to this position, but the High Court of Australia ruled that, although she was an Australian citizen, she was ineligible for election to sit as a Senator because she had not renounced her British citizenship, which the court assumed she possessed because she had been born in Britain.

Oldfield&#x27;s deputy leader in New South Wales was Brian Burston, who became a senator from New South Wales at the 2016 federal election for One Nation.

=====1999 New South Wales election=====
At the 1999 New South Wales state election, Oldfield was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council, where One Nation achieved 6.34% of the vote and narrowly missing out winning a second seat (contested by Brian Burston). This was the only seat in the New South Wales Parliament that the party secured. It was their first seat ever held in New South Wales.

===Member of the Legislative Council (1999–2007)===
Oldfield took office in the Legislative Council after the state election. He worked most notably on the General Purpose Standing Committee No. 4 (2003–2007). His maiden speech outlined the future course of action that One Nation would take, and spoke of invigorating the Australian community to support this.

In 2003 and 2006, Oldfield moved a bill for a Referendum on Death Penalty. 
====Expulsion from One Nation====
The popularity of One Nation began to decline after the 1998 federal election, in which Pauline Hanson lost her seat and only one senator was elected. An electoral redistribution essentially split Oxley (Hanson&#x27;s constituency) in half. Oxley was reconfigured as a marginal Labor seat, while a new seat of Blair was created in the rural area surrounding Ipswich. Hanson knew her chances of holding the reconfigured Oxley were slim, especially after former Labor state premier Wayne Goss won preselection for the seat.

Hanson launched her 1998 election campaign with a focus on jobs, rather than a focus on race/ethnicity or on &quot;the people&quot; against &quot;the elites&quot;. Instead, Hanson focused on unemployment and the need to create more jobs not through government schemes but by &quot;cheap loans to business, by more apprenticeships, and by doing something about tariffs&quot;. She opted to contest Blair, where most of her support was now located. On paper, Blair was a very safe Liberal seat with a notional majority of 18.7 percent. Hanson won 36 percent of the primary vote, slightly over 10% more than her nearest rival. However, preferences were enough to elect the Liberal candidate, Cameron Thompson, who had been third in the primary vote. Because all three major parties directed their preferences to each other ahead of Hanson, Thompson overtook the Labor candidate on National preferences and defeated Hanson on Labor preferences.

At the 2000 One Nation New South Wales State Conference, Hanson accused Oldfield of abusing his authority, usurping power and setting up alternative political parties under his control. His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife and the party saw a split in its New South Wales division, as well as earlier in Queensland and later in Western Australia.

====One Nation New South Wales====
As a result of his expulsion from the original party, Oldfield formed One Nation New South Wales in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as a political party under the ‘One Nation’ name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April 2002. The effect of this was that the original Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation was now unable to gain registration for New South Wales state elections, and therefore any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, One Nation could only contest federal elections in New South Wales, whilst the Oldfield group could only contest state elections in New South Wales.

One Nation NSW encountered some internal ruptures in 2002 and 2003 during the preselection process for the March 2003 New South Wales election. Brian Burston had been preselected by a party conference in December 2002 for 1st place on the party ticket, for the election to the Upper House, the Legislative Council. Oldfield however, had intended that his wife, Lisa, secure this position. He, therefore, summoned a second meeting of party members in January 2003, which saw a reversal of the December decision to give Burston the top spot on the ticket, in favour of Lisa Oldfield. Burston and his supporters filed legal action, and the court upheld the initial party decision of December, which gave Burston the leading position on the ticket.

At the March election, One Nation New South Wales achieved only 1.5% of the primary vote, compared to 6.3% for One Nation in the previous 1999 election that saw Oldfield elected. This result was substantially below the 4.55% election quota, and consequently, Burston failed to get elected. Apart from the internal feuding which affected the party&#x27;s performance, was the fact that Pauline Hanson also ran in the election as a grouped independent, with support from what was left of One Nation, and this fractured the One Nation vote. Hanson polled slightly better than Burston&#x27;s group, achieving 1.9%, and narrowly missed gaining the last Legislative Council spot.

Since the 2003 state election, One Nation New South Wales kept a very low profile. The party did not maintain a website and drew very little media attention. Oldfield resigned from the party in December 2004, to serve the remainder of his term as an independent.

====Resignation from Parliament====

In 2006, Oldfield announced that he would not contest the next state election. His term expired on 24 March 2007.

One Nation New South Wales, led by Judith Newson, met all the necessary registration criteria to achieve registration for the March 2007 NSW election. However, the party decided not to contest that election, and was deregistered shortly after the election.

==Media career, 2007–2018==

In 2006, he was a contestant on Australia&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Survivor&quot;. His performance as a player on the show, he was the 4th best &quot;Australian Survivor&quot; player among first four editions of the show by &quot;The OZ Network&quot;.

Oldfield commenced as a talkback radio host with Sydney radio station 2GB in November 2007. In 2009, Oldfield became the highest rating radio presenter in Sydney with 25.2% of the overnight audience. In 2010, Oldfield was fired by 2GB.

In May 2010, he began hosting the afternoon shift as a relief presenter on 2UE. After three days, Oldfield was suspended by the station for making inflammatory remarks with respect to asylum seekers. In his on-air comments, Oldfield suggested an immigration policy whereby:

:&quot;We’ll turn on the electric fences, we’ll stop them from coming, and the ones that are here: we’ll make sure they can’t escape, and if they do try it, they’ll be fried.&quot;

In December 2010, Oldfield replaced Steve Liebmann as the host of the Mornings program on 2UE.

In April 2012, Oldfield moved from the Mornings program to present Nights on 2UE.

In November 2016, Oldfield appeared on the SBS television program &quot;First Contact&quot;, a series that takes a group of Australians who have had limited contact with indigenous people and brings them into contact with them. In the first episode he stated that Aboriginal culture &quot;should have died out, like the Stone Age died out&quot;. He also expressed the view that the Australian constitution is not racist for omitting mention of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people. He also was seen making an emotional connection with an indigenous man over something they had in common; the death of their fathers.

In 2017, Oldfield appeared as a celebrity contestant on the Australian version of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

In 2018, Oldfield appeared as a celebrity contestant on the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here&quot;, alongside his wife Lisa.

==Personal life==

Oldfield was married to Lisa Oldfield, who was 16 years his junior. She was a former co-host of Channel 9&#x27;s daytime television program, &quot;The Catch-Up&quot;, and a castmate on &quot;The Real Housewives of Sydney&quot;. In 2010 the couple had their first child, and a second in 2012. The couple split in 2019.

In the documentary &quot;Pauline Hanson: Please Explain!&quot;, Oldfield describes himself as &quot;not a fan of multiculturalism&quot;.

Oldfield&#x27;s ex-wife Lisa describes herself as a 21% Native American in ancestry.

<text>In mathematics, analytic number theory is a branch of number theory that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. It is often said to have begun with Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet&#x27;s 1837 introduction of Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-functions to give the first proof of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions. It is well known for its results on prime numbers (involving the Prime Number Theorem and Riemann zeta function) and additive number theory (such as the Goldbach conjecture and Waring&#x27;s problem).

==Branches of analytic number theory==
Analytic number theory can be split up into two major parts, divided more by the type of problems they attempt to solve than fundamental differences in technique.
*Multiplicative number theory deals with the distribution of the prime numbers, such as estimating the number of primes in an interval, and includes the prime number theorem and Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions.
*Additive number theory is concerned with the additive structure of the integers, such as Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. One of the main results in additive number theory is the solution to Waring&#x27;s problem.

==History==

===Precursors===
Much of analytic number theory was inspired by the prime number theorem. Let π(&quot;x&quot;) be the prime-counting function that gives the number of primes less than or equal to &quot;x&quot;, for any real number &quot;x&quot;. For example, π(10) = 4 because there are four prime numbers (2, 3, 5 and 7) less than or equal to 10. The prime number theorem then states that &quot;x&quot; / ln(&quot;x&quot;) is a good approximation to π(&quot;x&quot;), in the sense that the limit of the &quot;quotient&quot; of the two functions π(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;x&quot; / ln(&quot;x&quot;) as &quot;x&quot; approaches infinity is 1:

: formula_1

known as the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers.

Adrien-Marie Legendre conjectured in 1797 or 1798 that π(&quot;a&quot;) is approximated by the function &quot;a&quot;/(&quot;A&quot; ln(&quot;a&quot;) + &quot;B&quot;), where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are unspecified constants. In the second edition of his book on number theory (1808) he then made a more precise conjecture, with &quot;A&quot; = 1 and &quot;B&quot; ≈ −1.08366. Carl Friedrich Gauss considered the same question: &quot;Im Jahr 1792 oder 1793&quot; (&#x27;in the year 1792 or 1793&#x27;), according to his own recollection nearly sixty years later in a letter to Encke (1849), he wrote in his logarithm table (he was then 15 or 16) the short note &quot;Primzahlen unter formula_2&quot; (&#x27;prime numbers under formula_2&#x27;). But Gauss never published this conjecture. In 1838 Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet came up with his own approximating function, the logarithmic integral li(&quot;x&quot;) (under the slightly different form of a series, which he communicated to Gauss). Both Legendre&#x27;s and Dirichlet&#x27;s formulas imply the same conjectured asymptotic equivalence of π(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;x&quot; / ln(&quot;x&quot;) stated above, although it turned out that Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation is considerably better if one considers the differences instead of quotients.

===Dirichlet===

Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet is credited with the creation of analytic number theory, a field in which he found several deep results and in proving them introduced some fundamental tools, many of which were later named after him. In 1837 he published Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, using mathematical analysis concepts to tackle an algebraic problem and thus creating the branch of analytic number theory. In proving the theorem, he introduced the Dirichlet characters and L-functions. In 1841 he generalized his arithmetic progressions theorem from integers to the ring of Gaussian integers formula_4.

===Chebyshev===

In two papers from 1848 and 1850, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty L&#x27;vovich Chebyshev attempted to prove the asymptotic law of distribution of prime numbers. His work is notable for the use of the zeta function ζ(&quot;s&quot;) (for real values of the argument &quot;s&quot;, as are works of Leonhard Euler, as early as 1737) predating Riemann&#x27;s celebrated memoir of 1859, and he succeeded in proving a slightly weaker form of the asymptotic law, namely, that if the limit of π(&quot;x&quot;)/(&quot;x&quot;/ln(&quot;x&quot;)) as &quot;x&quot; goes to infinity exists at all, then it is necessarily equal to one. He was able to prove unconditionally that this ratio is bounded above and below by two explicitly given constants near to 1 for all &quot;x&quot;. Although Chebyshev&#x27;s paper did not prove the Prime Number Theorem, his estimates for π(&quot;x&quot;) were strong enough for him to prove Bertrand&#x27;s postulate that there exists a prime number between &quot;n&quot; and 2&quot;n&quot; for any integer &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2.

===Riemann===

Bernhard Riemann made some famous contributions to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper (the only one he published on the subject of number theory), he investigated the Riemann zeta function and established its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. He made a series of conjectures about properties of the zeta function, one of which is the well-known Riemann hypothesis.

===Hadamard and de la Vallée-Poussin===

Extending the ideas of Riemann, two proofs of the prime number theorem were obtained independently by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin and appeared in the same year (1896). Both proofs used methods from complex analysis, establishing as a main step of the proof that the Riemann zeta function ζ(&quot;s&quot;) is non-zero for all complex values of the variable &quot;s&quot; that have the form &quot;s&quot; = 1 + &quot;it&quot; with &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0.

=== Modern times ===
The biggest technical change after 1950 has been the development of &quot;sieve methods&quot;, particularly in multiplicative problems. These are combinatorial in nature, and quite varied. The extremal branch of combinatorial theory has in return been greatly influenced by the value placed in analytic number theory on quantitative upper and lower bounds. Another recent development is &quot;probabilistic number theory&quot;, which uses methods from probability theory to estimate the distribution of number theoretic functions, such as how many prime divisors a number has.

Specifically, the breakthroughs by Yitang Zhang, James Maynard, Terence Tao and Ben Green have all used the Goldston–Pintz–Yıldırım method, which they originally used to prove that

formula_5

Developments within analytic number theory are often refinements of earlier techniques, which reduce the error terms and widen their applicability. For example, the &quot;circle method&quot; of Hardy and Littlewood was conceived as applying to power series near the unit circle in the complex plane; it is now thought of in terms of finite exponential sums (that is, on the unit circle, but with the power series truncated). The needs of Diophantine approximation are for auxiliary functions that are not generating functions—their coefficients are constructed by use of a pigeonhole principle—and involve several complex variables. The fields of Diophantine approximation and transcendence theory have expanded, to the point that the techniques have been applied to the Mordell conjecture.

== Problems and results ==

Theorems and results within analytic number theory tend not to be exact structural results about the integers, for which algebraic and geometrical tools are more appropriate. Instead, they give approximate bounds and estimates for various number theoretical functions, as the following examples illustrate.

=== Multiplicative number theory ===

Euclid showed that there are infinitely many prime numbers. An important question is to determine the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers; that is, a rough description of how many primes are smaller than a given number. Gauss, amongst others, after computing a large list of primes, conjectured that the number of primes less than or equal to a large number &quot;N&quot; is close to the value of the integral

formula_6

In 1859 Bernhard Riemann used complex analysis and a special meromorphic function now known as the Riemann zeta function to derive an analytic expression for the number of primes less than or equal to a real number &quot;x&quot;. Remarkably, the main term in Riemann&#x27;s formula was exactly the above integral, lending substantial weight to Gauss&#x27;s conjecture. Riemann found that the error terms in this expression, and hence the manner in which the primes are distributed, are closely related to the complex zeros of the zeta function. Using Riemann&#x27;s ideas and by getting more information on the zeros of the zeta function, Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin managed to complete the proof of Gauss&#x27;s conjecture. In particular, they proved that if 
formula_7
then
formula_8

This remarkable result is what is now known as the &quot;prime number theorem&quot;. It is a central result in analytic number theory. Loosely speaking, it states that given a large number &quot;N&quot;, the number of primes less than or equal to &quot;N&quot; is about &quot;N&quot;/log(&quot;N&quot;).

More generally, the same question can be asked about the number of primes in any arithmetic progression &quot;a&quot; + &quot;nq&quot; for any integer &quot;n&quot;. In one of the first applications of analytic techniques to number theory, Dirichlet proved that any arithmetic progression with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;q&quot; coprime contains infinitely many primes. The prime number theorem can be generalised to this problem; letting 
formula_9
then if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are coprime,
formula_10
where formula_11 is the totient function.

There are also many deep and wide-ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs seem too difficult for current techniques, such as the twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are infinitely many primes &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; + 2 is prime. On the assumption of the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture it has been proven recently that there are infinitely many primes &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; + &quot;k&quot; is prime for some positive even &quot;k&quot; at most 12. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are infinitely many primes &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; + &quot;k&quot; is prime for some positive even &quot;k&quot; at most 246.

=== Additive number theory ===

One of the most important problems in additive number theory is Waring&#x27;s problem, which asks whether it is possible, for any &quot;k&quot; ≥ 2, to write any positive integer as the sum of a bounded number of &quot;k&quot;th powers,

:formula_12

The case for squares, &quot;k&quot; = 2, was answered by Lagrange in 1770, who proved that every positive integer is the sum of at most four squares. The general case was proved by Hilbert in 1909, using algebraic techniques which gave no explicit bounds. An important breakthrough was the application of analytic tools to the problem by Hardy and Littlewood. These techniques are known as the circle method, and give explicit upper bounds for the function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), the smallest number of &quot;k&quot;th powers needed, such as Vinogradov&#x27;s bound

:formula_13

=== Diophantine problems ===
Diophantine problems are concerned with integer solutions to polynomial equations: one may study the distribution of solutions, that is, counting solutions according to some measure of &quot;size&quot; or &quot;height&quot;.

An important example is the Gauss circle problem, which asks for integers points (&quot;x&quot; &quot;y&quot;) which satisfy
:formula_14
In geometrical terms, given a circle centered about the origin in the plane with radius &quot;r&quot;, the problem asks how many integer lattice points lie on or inside the circle. It is not hard to prove that the answer is formula_15, where formula_16 as formula_17. Again, the difficult part and a great achievement of analytic number theory is obtaining specific upper bounds on the error term &quot;E&quot;(&quot;r&quot;).

It was shown by Gauss that formula_18. In general, an &quot;O&quot;(&quot;r&quot;) error term would be possible with the unit circle (or, more properly, the closed unit disk) replaced by the dilates of any bounded planar region with piecewise smooth boundary. Furthermore, replacing the unit circle by the unit square, the error term for the general problem can be as large as a linear function of &quot;r&quot;. Therefore, getting an error bound of the form formula_19
for some formula_20 in the case of the circle is a significant improvement. The first to attain this was
Sierpiński in 1906, who showed formula_21. In 1915, Hardy and Landau each showed that one does &quot;not&quot; have formula_22. Since then the goal has been to show that for each fixed formula_23 there exists a real number formula_24 such that formula_25.

In 2000 Huxley showed that formula_26, which is the best published result.

== Methods of analytic number theory ==

=== Dirichlet series ===

One of the most useful tools in multiplicative number theory are Dirichlet series, which are functions of a complex variable defined by an infinite series of the form

:formula_27

Depending on the choice of coefficients formula_28, this series may converge everywhere, nowhere, or on some half plane. In many cases, even where the series does not converge everywhere, the holomorphic function it defines may be analytically continued to a meromorphic function on the entire complex plane. The utility of functions like this in multiplicative problems can be seen in the formal identity

:formula_29

hence the coefficients of the product of two Dirichlet series are the multiplicative convolutions of the original coefficients. Furthermore, techniques such as partial summation and Tauberian theorems can be used to get information about the coefficients from analytic information about the Dirichlet series. Thus a common method for estimating a multiplicative function is to express it as a Dirichlet series (or a product of simpler Dirichlet series using convolution identities), examine this series as a complex function and then convert this analytic information back into information about the original function.

=== Riemann zeta function ===
Euler showed that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic implies (at least formally) the &quot;Euler product&quot;
: formula_30
where the product is taken over all prime numbers &quot;p&quot;.

Euler&#x27;s proof of the infinity of prime numbers makes use of the divergence of the term at the left hand side for &quot;s&quot; = 1 (the so-called harmonic series), a purely analytic result. Euler was also the first to use analytical arguments for the purpose of studying properties of integers, specifically by constructing generating power series. This was the beginning of analytic number theory.

Later, Riemann considered this function for complex values of &quot;s&quot; and showed that this function can be extended to a meromorphic function on the entire plane with a simple pole at &quot;s&quot; = 1. This function is now known as the Riemann Zeta function and is denoted by &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;). There is a plethora of literature on this function and the function is a special case of the more general Dirichlet L-functions.

Analytic number theorists are often interested in the error of approximations such as the prime number theorem. In this case, the error is smaller than &quot;x&quot;/log &quot;x&quot;. Riemann&#x27;s formula for π(&quot;x&quot;) shows that the error term in this approximation can be expressed in terms of the zeros of the zeta function. In his 1859 paper, Riemann conjectured that all the &quot;non-trivial&quot; zeros of ζ lie on the line formula_31 but never provided a proof of this statement. This famous and long-standing conjecture is known as the &quot;Riemann Hypothesis&quot; and has many deep implications in number theory; in fact, many important theorems have been proved under the assumption that the hypothesis is true. For example, under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis, the error term in the prime number theorem is 

In the early 20th century G. H. Hardy and Littlewood proved many results about the zeta function in an attempt to prove the Riemann Hypothesis. In fact, in 1914,
Hardy proved that there were infinitely many zeros of the zeta function on the critical line
:formula_32

This led to several theorems describing the density of the zeros on the critical line.

This centre would become known as York Colony.

The company founded the settlers&#x27; colony on the banks of the Little Whitesand River where lots were given freely to settlers who purchased land from them. The colony remained at its site until 1889. It was originally located at PT SE 1/4 13-26-4 W2M.
