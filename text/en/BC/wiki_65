<text>The United States Basketball League (USBL) was a professional men&#x27;s spring basketball league. The league was formed in 1985 and ceased operations in 2008. The USBL started in 1985 as one of the first basketball leagues to play a late-spring to early-summer schedule. The league quickly became known as a development league for players, with many players moving up to the National Basketball Association (NBA) and many more playing in Europe. In 1996, the league made a stock offering, a rarity among sports leagues. However, in later years, the league declined as rival leagues appeared and USBL had a tougher time replacing teams that folded. In the last two seasons, the league was mainly a midwestern league, with teams mainly in Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma. After speculation that the USBL might fold after the 2007 season, the league announced that it would sit out the 2008 season and consider its options for the future. In January 2010, the league expressed hopes to resume play in April 2010. However, no further news has surfaced from the league. The final champions are the Kansas Cagerz, who won the title game on July 1, 2007.

==History==
The United States Basketball League was founded in December 1984 by Daniel T. Meisenheimer, a stockbroker from Connecticut. The league management initially planned to schedule about 40 games during the summer, and started to look for new teams to join the newly formed USBL. Former NBA referee Richie Powers was named the league&#x27;s vice president and director of operations, while Earl Monroe was the commissioner. Meisenheimer introduced a salary cap of $250,000 per team. The teams for the first season were the Connecticut Colonials from New Haven, Connecticut; the New Jersey Jammers from Jersey City, New Jersey; the Long Island Knights from Long Island, New York (owned by Meisenheimer himself); the Rhode Island Gulls from Warwick, Rhode Island; the Springfield Fame from Springfield, Massachusetts; the Westchester Golden Apples from Westchester, New York; and the Wildwood Aces from Wildwood, New Jersey. Several players with NBA experience joined the USBL: among them Ken Bannister, Jim Bostic, Tracy Jackson, Lowes Moore, Eddie Lee Wilkins and Sam Worthen. Other players who played in the 1985 USBL season would later play in the NBA, such as Michael Adams, Manute Bol, Ron Crevier, Spud Webb and John &quot;Hot Rod&quot; Williams. After the regular season ended after each team played 25 games, the league management decided not to organize postseason games, since many players were going to join other teams for the start of the regular season of other leagues such as the NBA or the CBA. The first USBL champions were the Springfield Fame, that had ended the regular season leading the league with a 19–6 record. Hot Rod Williams and Tracy Jackson were named co-MVPs, while Manute Bol led the league both in rebounds per game (14.2) and blocks per game (11.2).

In 1986 two teams, the Long Island Knights and the Rhode Island Gulls, left the league, and three new franchises joined the USBL: the Gold Coast Stingrays from West Palm Beach, Florida, the Staten Island Stallions from Staten Island, New York and the Tampa Bay Flash from Tampa, Florida. In the same year Nancy Lieberman joined the Springfield Fame and became the first female player to play in a professional league with men. Lieberman debuted in June 1986 in a game against the Staten Island Stallions, playing 3 minutes during which she did not score. In 1987 another woman joined the USBL: Lynette Richardson, who had played college basketball at Florida International, signed for the Miami Tropics. On June 13, 1987, Richardson and Lieberman played against each other during a game between the Miami Tropics and the Long Island Knights: Richardson scored 3 points while Lieberman scored 2.

The top teams of the regular season advanced to the &quot;USBL Postseason Festival&quot;, a playoffs system that saw teams play single elimination games in order to advance to the final game. On three occasions (1985, 1986 and 1990) no postseason was held, and the team with the best regular season record won the championship. In 1989 the USBL ceased operations temporarily in order to improve its organization, and resumed the following season, in 1990.

<text>Dumping, in economics, is a form of predatory pricing, especially in the context of international trade. It occurs when manufacturers export a product to another country at a price below the normal price with an injuring effect. The objective of dumping is to increase market share in a foreign market by driving out competition and thereby create a monopoly situation where the exporter will be able to unilaterally dictate price and quality of the product. Trade treaties might include mechanisms to alleviate problems related to dumping, such as countervailing duty penalties and anti-dumping statutes.

==Overview==
A standard technical definition of dumping is the act of charging a lower price for the like product in a foreign market than the normal value of the product, for example the price of the same product in a domestic market of the exporter or in a third country market. This is often referred to as selling at less than &quot;normal value&quot; on the same level of trade in the ordinary course of trade. Under the World Trade Organization&#x27;s Antidumping Agreement, full name &quot;Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994&quot;, dumping is not prohibited unless it causes or threatens to cause material injury to a domestic industry in the importing country. Dumping is also prohibited when it causes &quot;material retardation&quot; in the establishment of an industry in the domestic market.

The term has a negative connotation, as advocates of competitive markets see &quot;dumping&quot; as a form of unfair competition. Furthermore, advocates for workers and laborers believe that safeguarding businesses against such practices, such as dumping, help alleviate some of the harsher consequences of such practices between economies at different stages of development (see &quot;protectionism&quot;). The Bolkestein directive, for example, was accused in Europe of being a form of &quot;social dumping&quot;, as it favored competition between workers, as exemplified by the Polish plumber stereotype. While there are few examples of a national scale dumping that succeeded in producing a national-level monopoly, there are several examples of local &#x27;dumping&#x27; that produced a monopoly in regional markets for certain industries. Ron Chernow points to the example of regional oil monopolies in &quot;&quot; where oil in one market, Cincinnati, would be sold at or below cost to drive competition&#x27;s profits down and force them to exit the market. In another area where other independent businesses were already driven out, namely in Chicago, prices would be increased by a quarter.

&quot;Third country dumping&quot; refers to a situation in which exports of a product from one country are being injured or threatened with injury because of exports of a product from a second country into a third country at less than fair value.

==Anti-dumping actions==
===Legal issues===
If a company exports a product at a price that is lower than the price it normally charges in its own home market, or sells at a price that does not meet its full cost of production, it is said to be &quot;dumping&quot; the product. It is a sub part of the various forms of price discrimination and is classified as third-degree price discrimination. Opinions differ as to whether or not such practice constitutes unfair competition, but many governments take action against dumping to protect domestic industry. The WTO agreement does not pass judgment. Its focus is on how governments can or cannot react to dumping—it disciplines anti-dumping actions, and it is often called the &quot;anti-dumping agreement&quot;. (This focus only on the reaction to dumping contrasts with the approach of the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement.)

The legal definitions are more precise, but broadly speaking, the WTO agreement allows governments to act against dumping where there is genuine (&quot;material&quot;) injury to the competing domestic industry. To do so, the government has to show that dumping is taking place, calculate the extent of dumping (how much lower the export price is compared to the exporter&#x27;s home market price), and show that the dumping is causing injury or threatening to cause injury.

===Definitions and extent===
While permitted by the WTO, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (Article VI) allows countries the option of taking action against dumping. The Anti-Dumping Agreement clarifies and expands Article VI, and the two operate together. They allow countries to act in a way that would normally break the GATT principles of binding a tariff and not discriminating between trading partners—typically anti-dumping action means charging extra import duty on the particular product from the particular exporting country, in order to bring its price closer to the &quot;normal value&quot; or to remove the injury to domestic industry in the importing country.

There are many different ways of calculating whether a particular product is being dumped heavily or only lightly. The agreement narrows down the range of possible options, providing three methods to calculate a product&#x27;s &quot;normal value&quot;. The main one is based on the price in the exporter&#x27;s domestic market. When this cannot be used, two alternatives are available, the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter&#x27;s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. The agreement also specifies how a fair comparison can be made between the export price and what would be a normal price.

===Five-percent rule===
According to footnote 2 to the Anti-Dumping Agreement, domestic sales of the like product are sufficient to base normal value on if they account for 5 percent or more of the sales of the product under consideration to the importing country market. This is often called the five-percent or home-market-viability test. This test is applied globally by comparing the quantity sold of a like product on the domestic market with the quantity sold to the importing market.

Normal value cannot be based on the price in the exporter&#x27;s domestic market when there are no domestic sales, for example if the products are only sold on the foreign market. The normal value will then have to be determined on another basis. Additionally, some products may be sold on both markets but the quantity sold on the domestic market may be small compared to quantity sold on a foreign market. This situation happens often in countries with small domestic markets like Hong Kong and Singapore, though similar circumstances may also happen in larger markets. This is because of differences in factors like consumer taste and maintenance.

Calculating the extent of dumping on a product is not enough. Anti-dumping measures can only be applied if the act of dumping is harming the industry in the importing country. Therefore, a detailed investigation must first be conducted according to specified rules. The investigation must evaluate all relevant economic factors that have a bearing on the state of the industry in question; if it is revealed that dumping is taking place and hurting domestic industry, the exporting company can raise its price to an agreed level in order to avoid anti-dumping import duties.

===Procedures in investigation and litigation===
Detailed procedures are set out on how anti-dumping cases are to be initiated, how the investigations are to be conducted, and the conditions for ensuring that all interested parties are given an opportunity to present evidence. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless a review shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.

Generally speaking, an anti-dumping investigation usually develops along the following steps: domestic producers make a request to the relevant authority to initiate an anti-dumping investigation. Then investigation to the foreign producer is conducted to determine if the allegation is valid. It uses questionnaires completed by the interested parties to compare the foreign producer&#x27;s (or producers&#x27;) export price to the normal value (the price in the exporter&#x27;s domestic market, the price charged by the exporter in another country, or a calculation based on the combination of the exporter&#x27;s production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins). If the foreign producer&#x27;s export price is lower than the normal price and the investigating body proves a causal link between the alleged dumping and the injury suffered by the domestic industry, it comes to a conclusion that the foreign producer is dumping its products. According to Article VI of GATT, dumping investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than 18 months after initiation. Anti-dumping measures must expire five years after the date of imposition, unless a review shows that ending the measure would lead to injury.

Anti-dumping investigations are to end immediately in cases where the authorities determine that the margin of dumping is, &quot;de minimis&quot;, or insignificantly small (defined as less than 2% of the export price of the product). Other conditions are also set. For example, the investigations also have to end if the volume of dumped imports is negligible (i.e., if the volume from one country is less than 3% of total imports of that product—although investigations can proceed if several countries, each supplying less than 3% of the imports, together account for 7% or more of total imports).

The agreement says member countries must inform the Committee on Anti-Dumping Practices about all preliminary and final anti-dumping actions, promptly and in detail. They must also report on all investigations twice a year. When differences arise, members are encouraged to consult each other. They can also use the WTO&#x27;s dispute settlement procedure.

===Abuse of anti-dumping measures===
Although anti-dumping measures play a vital rule in preventing protectionism and promote free trade, many instances of anti-dumping practices suggest that anti-dumping measures have been used as a tool of protectionism. India and China have been alleged to have used Anti-dumping Duty (ADD) as a form of &quot;safety valve&quot; – to ease competitive pressure in domestic market. Anti-dumping measures have also been used as a form of &quot;retaliation&quot; against products of countries that impose ADDs against the products of the host country. The USA has been consistently alleged to have abused anti-dumping measures with its practice of zeroing. Similarly, in only around 2% cases the EU has been found to have imposed ADDs to offset dumping. In the remaining 98% cases of anti-dumping have been used for purposes other than offsetting dumping.

==By Country==
===United States===
In the United States, domestic firms can file an anti-dumping petition under the regulations determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which determines &quot;less than fair value&quot; and the International Trade Commission, which determines &quot;injury&quot;. These proceedings operate on a timetable governed by U.S. law. The Department of Commerce has regularly found that products have been sold at less than fair value in U.S. markets. If the domestic industry is able to establish that it is being injured by the dumping, then anti-dumping duties are imposed on goods imported from the dumpers&#x27; country at a percentage rate calculated to counteract the dumping margin. In 2021, this happened when the US Aluminum Association filed a complaint to the Department of Commerce against Armenia and several other countries claiming that due to &quot;aggressively low-priced import of the aluminum&quot;, it is being sold at less than fair value. Because of that Biden administration has introduced an anti-dumping measure of Armenian exporters being obliged to pay a deposit equal to 188.4% of the product value at the Customs.

Related to anti-dumping duties are &quot;countervailing duties&quot;. The difference is that countervailing duties seek to offset injurious subsidization while anti-dumping duties offset injurious dumping.

Some commentators have noted that domestic protectionism, and lack of knowledge regarding foreign cost of production, lead to the unpredictable institutional process surrounding investigation. Members of the WTO can file complaints against anti-dumping measures.

Because of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, October 27, 1997 mini-crash, and 1998 Russian financial crisis, the United States steel producers were severely harmed by a record surge of more than 40 million tons of cheap steel imports, resulting in the loss of more than 10,000 steel production jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause of three bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies (Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel), reduced volume, lower prices, and affecting the willingness of private banks and investment institutions to make loans to the U.S. steel producers. As a result, Congress passed the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Act of 1999, also known as the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Act of 1999.

Section 1318 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (PL 100-418) establishes procedures for US industries to petition the US Trade Representative to request a foreign government that is a signatory to the GATT Anti-Dumping Code to initiate an antidumping investigation on behalf of a US industry that claims it is being injured by dumping in that country&#x27;s market.

=== European Union===
European Union anti-dumping actions are under the purview of the European Commission. The Commission is obliged to launch an anti-dumping investigation if it receives a valid complaint from an EU industry providing sufficient evidence that exporting producers from one or more countries are dumping a particular product onto the EU market and causing injury to the EU industry. Regulation (EC) No 2423/88 was the first regulation applicable to this policy field.

Later actions were governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (as it then was), and Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community. However, implementation of anti-dumping actions (trade defence actions) is taken after voting by various committees with member state representation.

Regulation (EC) No 384/96 was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009; however, the repeal of the 1996 regulation did not prejudice the validity of proceedings already underway. Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union (codification) now applies.

EU regulations provide for a compulsory &quot;lesser duty rule&quot;, which states that the level of the duty imposed must be limited to &quot;the minimum level necessary 
to offset [the] injury&quot; caused to the EU industry. The European Commission put forward a proposal in 2013 which would remove the &quot;lesser duty rule&quot; in some cases, where circumvention of the rules, subsidies, or &quot;structural raw material distortions&quot; are in operation, i.e. where states &quot;interfere [with] trade of raw materials with a view to keeping raw materials in those countries for the benefit of domestic downstream users, for instance by imposing export taxes or operating dual pricing schemes&quot;. The European Parliament and the Council agreed in the modernisation of EU trade defence legislation that the rule would no longer apply in anti-subsidy proceedings from mid-2018. 

The bureaucratic entity responsible for advising member states on anti-dumping actions is the Directorate General Trade (DG Trade) in Brussels. Community industry can apply to have an anti-dumping investigation begin. DG Trade first investigates the standing of the complainants. If they are found to represent at least 25% of community industry, the investigation will probably begin. The process is guided by quite specific guidance in the regulations. The DG Trade will make a recommendation to a committee known as the Anti-Dumping Advisory Committee, on which each member state has one vote. Member states abstaining will be treated as if they voted in favour of industrial protection, a voting system which has come under considerable criticism. The dumping investigation includes comparison of domestic prices of the accused dumping nation with prices of the imported product on the European market. However, several rules are applied to the data before the dumping margin is calculated. Most contentious is the concept of &quot;analogue market&quot;. 

As is implied by the criterion for beginning an investigation, EU anti-dumping actions are primarily considered part of a &quot;trade defence&quot; portfolio. Consumer interests and non-industry related interests (&quot;community interests&quot;) are not emphasized during an investigation. An investigation typically looks for damage caused by dumping to community producers, and the level of tariff set is based on the damage done to community producers by dumping.

If no consensus is reached, the decision is referred to the European Council.

If imposed, theoretically duties last for five years. In practice they last at least a year longer, because expiry reviews are usually initiated at the end of the five years, and during the review process the status quo is maintained.

====Common Agricultural Policy====
The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union has often been accused of dumping despite significant reforms, as part of the Agreement on Agriculture at the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations in 1992 and in subsequent incremental reforms, notably the Luxembourg Agreement in 2003. Initially, the CAP sought to increase European agricultural production and provide support to European farmers through a process of market intervention whereby a special fund, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, would buy up surplus agricultural produce if the price fell below the centrally-determined intervention level.

European farmers were given a &quot;guaranteed&quot; price for their produce when it was sold in the European Community, and a system of export reimbursements ensured that European exports would sell at or below world prices, at no detriment to the European producer. The policy was heavily criticised as distorting world trade, and since 1992, the policy has moved away from market intervention and towards direct payments to farmers regardless of production, called &quot;decoupling&quot;. Furthermore, the payments are generally dependent on farmers fulfilling certain environmental or animal welfare requirements to encourage responsible, sustainable farming in what is termed &quot;multifunctional&quot; agricultural subsidies. Social, environmental and other benefits of subsidies would no longer not include a simple increase in production.

===China===
Some exporting nations are not granted &quot;market economy status&quot;: China is a prime example because its market status is considered &quot;state-sponsored capitalism&quot;. In such cases, the DG Trade is prevented from using domestic prices as the fair measure of the domestic price. A particular export industry may also lose market status if the DG Trade concludes that this industry receives government assistance. Other tests applied include the application of international accounting standards and bankruptcy laws. The consequences of not being granted market economy status have a big impact on the investigation. For example, if China is accused of dumping widgets, the basic approach is to consider the price of widgets in China against the price of Chinese widgets in Europe. But China does not have market economy status, so Chinese domestic prices cannot be used as the reference. Instead, the DG Trade must decide upon an analogue market: a market which does have market economy status, and which is similar enough to China. Brazil and Mexico have been used, but the United States is a popular analogue market. In this case, the price of widgets in the United States is regarded as the substitute for the price of widgets in China. This process of choosing an analogue market is subject to the influence of the complainant, which has led to some criticism that it is an inherent bias in the process.

Critics have argued that it is quite unreasonable to compare China&#x27;s goods price to the United States as analogue. China is now developing to a more free and open market, unlike its planned-economy in the early 1960s, the market in China is more willing to embrace the global competition. It is thus required to improve its market regulations and conquer the free trade barriers to improve the situation and produce a properly judged pricing level to assess the &quot;dumping&quot; behaviour.

An example of an anti-dumping duty action taken by the European Union is that of the duty imposed upon bicycle imports from China into the EU, which has recently be continued at a rate of 48.5%. The tax has also been extended to imports from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. However, some companies are excluded or have a reduced rate.

===India===
The current set of anti-dumping laws in India is defined by Section 9A and 9B of Customs and Tariffs Act, 1975 (Amended 1995) and The Anti-dumping rules such as (Identification, Assessment and Collection of Anti-dumping Duty on Dumped Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules of 1995, Section 9A of customs and tariffs Act 1975 states that &quot;If any article is exported from any country or territory to India at less than its normal value, then, upon the importation of such article into India, the central government may by notification in the official gazette, impose an anti-dumping duty not exceeding the margin of dumping in relation to such article.&quot; 
As of November 28, 2016, 353 anti-dumping cases has been initiated by Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD) out of which in one hundred and thirty cases, anti-dumping measures are in force. 
In January 2017, the Indian government imposed anti-dumping duty on colour coated steel products imported from the European Union and China for 6 months.

Though, the move was applauded by Essar Steel India Commercial Director, H Shivram Krishnan but, importers expressed their concern regarding protective measures like minimum import price and anti-dumping duty especially when domestic is narrowing and imports are falling.

In July 2015, the government imposed anti-dumping duty on fibreboard imported from Indonesia and Vietnam. This came after CEO and joint-Managing Director of Greenply Industries, Shobhan Mittal filed an application for anti-dumping probe initiation. The primary reason behind the probe was that the price differential between domestic and imported MDF stood at 5–6 percent and net MDF imports was at around 30–35 percent, majority of which came from Indonesia and Vietnam.

On 8 March 2017, the government of India imposed anti-dumping duty ranging from US$6.30 to US$351.72 per tonne on imports of jute and its products from Bangladesh and Nepal. Later the government of India withdrew the anti-dumping duty in case of Nepal.

On 26 October 2017, India imposed anti-dumping duty on stainless steel from US, EU and China.

India has imposed anti-dumping duty on certain stainless steel products from the European Union and other nations including China and Korea, in order to protect the domestic industry from cheap imports.

The duty was imposed by the Revenue department following the recommendation by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD).

* The levied duty will range between 4.58 per cent and 57.39 per cent of the landed value of cold-rolled flat products of stainless steel.
* The anti-dumping duty will be in effect until 10 December 2020.
* The direction however, exempts certain grades of stainless steel from the duty.
* The duty will be levied on the imports of stainless steel products from China, Taiwan, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand, the United States and the European Union.

On 22nd December 2023, India imposed anti-dumping duty on the imports of industrial laser machines, including laser cutting, marking, and welding machines, originating in or exported from China. 
The duty was imposed by the Revenue department by the recommendation of the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping and Allied Duties (DGAD).
* The Central Government has imposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 24.66% to 147.20% of the CIF value on industrial laser machines imported from China.
* The duty applies to imports from China, regardless of the country of export. 
* The anti-dumping duty will be in effect for 5 years from the date of notification, unless revoked or amended earlier.
Exemptions
* The anti-dumping duty does not apply to imports of industrial laser machines produced by certain Chinese producers, who were found to not be dumping.

===Israel===
Israel&#x27;s anti-dumping and countervailing duty tribunal is the Trade Levies Commission.

=== South Korea ===
After South Korea switched its diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China on Taiwan to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1992, the ROC filed anti-dumping lawsuits against South Korea.

<text>The redhead (Aythya americana) is a medium-sized diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek &quot;aithuia&quot;, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin &quot;americana&quot;, of America. The redhead is long with an wingspan; the weight ranges from , with males weighing an average of and females an average of . It belongs to the genus &quot;Aythya&quot;, together with 11 other described species. The redhead and the common pochard form a sister group which together is sister to the canvasback. This waterfowl is easily distinguished from most other ducks by the male&#x27;s copper colored head and pale blue bill during the breeding season; from its close relative canvasback it is distinguished by the more rounded head, shorter bill, and (in the males) yellow, not red, eye. The Eurasian common pochard is even more similar, but very rarely overlaps in range; it also differs in having a red eye, and a more acute, less rounded head shape.

Other names that have been used for the redhead include red-headed duck and the red-headed pochard.

== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==
=== Taxonomy ===
The redhead is in the family Anatidae (ducks, swans, geese) and genus &quot;Aythya&quot; (diving ducks). There are currently no accepted subspecies of the redhead.

The two syntype specimens of &quot;Fuligula americana&quot; Eyton (Monogr. Anat., 1838, p.155) are held in the vertebrate zoology collections of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers NML-VZ D829 (male immature) and NML-VZ D829a (female adult). The specimens were collected in North America and came to the Liverpool national collection via Thomas Campbell Eyton’s collection and the 13th Earl of Derby’s collection which was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool.

=== Phylogeny ===
The redhead and the common pochard form a sister group which itself is sister to the canvasback. This group is then sister to the monophyletic group consisting of the white-eyes (hardhead, Madagascar pochard, and the sister species ferruginous duck and baer&#x27;s pochard) and scaups (New Zealand scaup, ring-necked duck, tufted duck, greater scaup, lesser scaup).

== Description ==
The redhead is a pochard, a diving duck specially adapted to foraging underwater. Their legs are placed further back on the body, which makes walking on land difficult. The webbing on their feet is larger than dabbling ducks and their bills are broader to facilitate underwater foraging. In addition, pochards have a lobed hind toe. No pochard has a metallic colored speculum, something that is characteristic of other ducks.

=== Males ===
During breeding season, adult males have a copper head and neck, with a black breast. The back and sides are gray, the belly is white and the rump and tail are black. Male bills are pale blue with a black tip and a thin ring separating the two colors. Non-breeding males lose the copper color and instead have brown heads. The eyes are yellow, one of the most obvious distinctions from canvasback and common pochard, which have red eyes.

=== Females ===

Adult females, however, have a yellow to brown head and neck. The breast is brown, the belly is white and the rest of the body is a gray to brown. The female bills are slate with a dark tip that is separated by a blue ring. Females remain the same color year round. The eyes are brown, as in all other &quot;Aythya&quot; species.

== Distribution ==
During breeding season, redheads are found across a wide range of North America, from as far north as Northern Canada, south to the Caribbean in winter. Their preferred areas include the intermontane regions of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Dakotas with some small localities in Ontario, Quebec and southern United States. These pochards then migrate south to winter in warmer climates. These areas include southern United States where breeding does not occur and extends to Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and the Bahamas. In both seasons, redheads use wetlands as their main habitat.

== Habitat ==
Small, semi-permanent wetlands in non-forested country where the water is deep enough to provide dense emergent vegetation is considered ideal breeding habitat for redheads. When wintering, redheads switch to large areas of water near the coast that are protected from wave action, but can also be found in reservoirs, lakes, playa wetlands, freshwater river deltas, coastal marshes, estuaries and bays.

== Predators ==
Redheads do not have many predators and are most likely to die of disease or indirect human impact. These ducks are considered less desirable as table fare than their puddle duck cousins like the mallard. However, their beautiful plumage makes them a targeted species for waterfowl hunters looking to focus on diving ducks. Adults can be preyed upon by northern river otters, red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, bald eagles, golden eagles and to a greater extent, minks. Most predation comes in the form of duckling predation and egg foraging. Northern pike and snapping turtles are known to eat ducklings whereas skunks, minks, crows and magpies will steal and eat redhead eggs.

== Population status ==
The North American Waterfowl Management Plan for redheads is 760,000 North American birds. The population size has increased in the past few decades to well over 1.4 million birds. Redheads make up 2% of North America&#x27;s duck population and only 1% of its harvested ducks. Populations may be stable because of restrictive bag limits for the species. In addition, the species uses semi-permanent and permanent wetlands to breed and these habitats are less likely to be affected by drought. For future management of the species, organizations are looking into wetland conservation.

== Behavior ==

=== Migration ===

==== Spring ====
Redheads begin to leave their winter range in late January and February with the northernmost birds migrating by late April. In western North America, migrants begin arriving in Oregon, British Columbia and Colorado in February. In central North America, migrants arrive as soon as temperatures open wetlands and lakes, which can range from late February (Nebraska) to early May (Alberta, Manitoba and Iowa). In the Great Lakes region and north-eastern North America, migrants will also arrive as soon as bodies of water open up.

==== Fall ====
Western birds migrate through Great Basin to the Pacific Coast. In British Columbia, fall migration begins in September and continues through October. The Great Salt Lake region is of particular importance to migrants in western United States. Central North American redheads will begin migrating earlier, around August/September and go through the Great Plains to the Texas coast. Eastern populations will migrate through the Great Lakes region to the Atlantic Coast or Florida from October to November. Most redheads winter along the Gulf of Mexico (offshore Louisiana, Florida and Mexico). However, eastern populations will winter in South Carolina.

=== Reproduction ===

==== Mating ====

Redheads flock together on lakes and other bodies of water, but migrate in pairs, which are formed in December or January through elaborate courtship rituals. Unpaired redheads migrate together in a ‘courting party’ that can be up to 25 individuals strong, enabling them to find a mate within the group. The pair bonds are established yearly through a long courtship process. Males begin this process through neck-kinking and head throwing displays while emitting a cat-like call. The male continues by initiating a neck-stretching display while producing a cough-like call. If interested, the female produces inciting calls towards the male while performing alternate lateral and chin lifting movements. The male then swims ahead of her and turns the back of his head towards the female. Once courtship is finished, the two birds are paired for the year. The male initiates copulation by alternating bill dipping and preening dorsally towards the female, upon which the female may return to the male.

==== Nesting ====
Once copulation is completed, female redheads begin forming nests. They are built with thick and strong plant material in emergent vegetation, such as hard stem bulrush, cattails and sedges, over or near standing water. Redheads do not defend their territory or home range; they are instead social while in their breeding ground. This is thought to facilitate brood parasitism on other pochards, which is particularly prevalent on the part of younger, less experienced redhead females. In this process, redheads lay their eggs in other pochards’ nests, including the canvasback, ring-necked duck and greater and lesser scaups, and this parasitism by redheads reduces the hatching success of other pochards’ eggs, especially those of the canvasback. The parasitic relationship between the redhead and other pochards promotes hybridization between the species; redhead hybrids with the ring-necked duck, canvasback and the greater and lesser scaups have been found. Canvasback × redhead hybrids can be fertile. Brood sizes range from 5 to 7 young, with the mother abandoning the chicks at 8 weeks old, 2–4 weeks before they are capable of flight.

==== Vocalizations ====
There is little information on redhead vocalizations outside of breeding calls. When the neck is fully extended in the neck-stretching display, males emit a cat-like &quot;wheee-oww&quot;. Males may also produce a soft coughing call, although this call is less frequent. Females emit a soft &quot;errrr&quot; note when inciting a male.

=== Feeding habits ===
All pochards have similar diets that include both plant and animal materials. Redheads undergo a niche switch when breeding and when wintering. During the breeding season, redheads will eat as much animal matter as possible, including gastropods, mollusks and insect larvae. They will eat the occasional grass and other emergent vegetation. However, once they fly south, redheads will change their diet to include mostly plant material, consisting of pondweeds, wild rice, wild celery, wigeon grass, bulrushes, muskgrass and shoal grass.

Gastropods known as food of &quot;Aythya americana&quot; include: &quot;Acteocina canaliculata&quot;, &quot;Acteon punctostriatus&quot;, &quot;Anachis avara&quot;, &quot;Anachis obesa&quot;, &quot;Caecum nitidum&quot;, &quot;Calliostoma&quot; sp., &quot;Cerithidea pliculosa&quot;, &quot;Cerithium lutosum&quot;, &quot;Crepidula convexa&quot;, &quot;Diastoma varium&quot;, &quot;Melanella&quot; sp., &quot;Mitrella lunata&quot;, &quot;Nassarius acutus&quot;, &quot;Nassarius vibex&quot;, &quot;Natica&quot; sp., &quot;Neritina virginea&quot;, &quot;Odostomia trifida&quot;, &quot;Olivella minuta&quot;, &quot;Olivella watermani&quot;, &quot;Polinices&quot; sp., Pyramidellidae, &quot;Pyrgocythara plicosa&quot;, &quot;Rissoina catesbyana&quot;, &quot;Sayella livida&quot;, &quot;Turbonilla&quot; sp., &quot;Turbonilla interrupta&quot; and &quot;Vitrinella&quot; sp.

<text>The Tony Award for Best Musical is given annually to the best new Broadway musical, as determined by Tony Award voters. The award is one of the ceremony&#x27;s longest-standing awards, having been presented each year since 1949. The award goes to the producers of the winning musical. A musical is eligible for consideration in a given year if it has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not &quot;determined... to be a &#x27;classic&#x27; or in the historical or popular repertoire&quot;, otherwise it may be considered for Best Revival of a Musical.

Best Musical is the final award presented at the Tony Awards ceremony. Excerpts from the musicals that are nominated for this award are usually performed during the ceremony before this award is presented.

This is a list of winners and nominees for the Tony Award for Best Musical.

==Records==
Accumulated records as of 2022:
* &quot;The Producers&quot; has won the most Tonys, winning in 12 categories, including Best Musical. 
* &quot;Hamilton&quot; is the most-nominated production in Tony history, with 16 nominations.
* &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Fiorello!&quot; are the only two musicals to date to have ever tied for the Best Musical award (in 1960).
* &quot;Passion&quot; is the shortest-running winner, with 280 performances. (If preview performances are included, then that distinction belongs to &quot;A Strange Loop&quot;.)
* &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; is the longest-running Best Musical winner, with 16 previews and over 13,981 performances.
* &quot;Hallelujah, Baby!&quot; is the only show thus far to have won the Tony Award for Best Musical after closing.
* &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; are the only two shows to win the Tony Award for Best Musical without any Tony nominations in the acting categories. (In &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;&#x27;s case, only winners were announced that year, and only in the lead performance categories.)
* &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; (1972), &quot;Raisin&quot; (1974), &quot;42nd Street&quot; (1981) and &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; (2022) won Best Musical and only one other Tony Award.
* What is now the Richard Rodgers Theatre has housed more Best Musical winners than any other theater on Broadway: &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; (1951), &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1956), &quot;Redhead&quot; (1959), &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1962), &quot;1776&quot; (1969), &quot;Raisin&quot; (1974), &quot;Nine&quot; (1982), &quot;In the Heights&quot; (2008), and &quot;Hamilton&quot; (2016).
*&quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; was the first winner of the Tony Award for Best Musical to be entirely written by one man, Rupert Holmes. &quot;Rent&quot; (by Jonathan Larson), &quot;Hamilton&quot; (by Lin-Manuel Miranda), and &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; (by Michael R. Jackson) also achieved this feat. &quot;Hadestown&quot; is the first musical entirely written by one woman, Anaïs Mitchell, to win this award.
* &quot;Fun Home&quot; was the first musical written entirely by a team of women to win the Tony Award for Best Musical.
* The 74th Tony Awards (2020) is the first ceremony in which only jukebox musicals were nominated.

<text>Bend It Like Beckham is a 2002 sports comedy-drama film directed by Gurinder Chadha from a screenplay by Chadha, Paul Mayeda Berges, and Guljit Bindra. The film stars Parminder Nagra, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Anupam Kher, Juliet Stevenson, Shaznay Lewis and Archie Panjabi. In &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, Jesminder Bhamra (Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Knightley) chase careers in professional football despite their parents&#x27; wishes.

Development for the film began after Chadha, Bindra, and Berges completed the screenplay by early 2001. Nagra and Knightley were hired soon after, with casting rounded out with the additions of Meyers, Kher, Stevenson, Lewis, and Panjabi by that May. Principal photography began in June 2001 and lasted until September, with filming locations including London, Shepperton Studios, and Hamburg. Production collaborated with The Football Association, while the film&#x27;s title refers to David Beckham&#x27;s curling free kick technique, also known as bending.

&quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2002 by Redbus Film Distribution. The film surprised critics, who praised the screenplay, light-hearted tone, and commentary on Punjabi social norms and culture. &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; grossed $76.6 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing football sports film. In 2015 it was adapted into a stage musical that opened at the Phoenix Theatre.

==Plot==
18-year-old Jesminder &quot;Jess&quot; Bhamra is the daughter of British Indian Punjabi Sikhs living in Hounslow, London. Jess is passionate about football, but her parents do not support her interest, preferring that she focus on academics. However, she sometimes plays in the park with boys, including her best friend, Tony, who is thought to be interested in Jess, but is revealed to be gay later in the film. Jess&#x27;s family is occupied with planning for the upcoming wedding of her older sister Pinky.

Jules Paxton, a member of the Hounslow Harriers, a local women&#x27;s amateur football team, notices Jess&#x27;s football skills and befriends her, inviting her to try out for the team. The coach, Joe, a young Irish former player whose own career was derailed by injuries, accepts her into the team. Although Jess&#x27;s parents (mainly her mother) forbid her to join the team, she continues playing in secret, claiming to have a summer job when she is actually at football practice. When Joe learns that Jess is on the team without her parents&#x27; permission, he pleads with Mr. Bhamra to allow Jess to play, but he refuses, revealing that he does not want Jess to suffer the way he did when he was excluded from a cricket club because of anti-Indian sentiment.

With Pinky covering for her, Jess travels with the team to play a match in Germany; the Harriers lose the match after Jess fails to score a penalty kick. When they go out clubbing in Hamburg after the match, Jules catches Joe and Jess about to kiss. This sours the two girls&#x27; friendship, as Jules also is attracted to Joe despite denying fancying him when Jess asked her earlier. Furthermore, Jess&#x27;s parents find out she is still playing football after her father sees a newspaper article about the Hamburg match. After returning, Jess goes to Jules&#x27;s house to try to patch up their friendship but is rebuffed. Jules&#x27;s mother, confused by overhearing parts of their argument out of context, thinks they are in a lesbian relationship. (Although Jules&#x27;s father correctly warns his wife that she is possibly jumping to the wrong conclusions, she remains adamant.)

Jess&#x27;s father secretly attends one of her games and sees Jess mocked with a racial slur by an opposing player, and Joe hugging her afterward to comfort her. The Harriers qualify for the finals of the league tournament, but the championship match, with an American talent scout in attendance, is to be held on the same day as Pinky&#x27;s wedding, so Jess resigns herself to missing the game. At Pinky&#x27;s wedding, Jess is visibly miserable; her father tells her to go to the game so she can be happy on her sister&#x27;s wedding day. The Harriers are behind 1–0 when Jess arrives, but they rally, and eventually, Jess wins the game with a free kick. The scout offers Jess and Jules sports scholarships at Santa Clara University in California. Jules and Jess share a hug and kiss to celebrate, furthering Jules&#x27;s mother&#x27;s suspicions. Jess returns to the wedding, happy and able to celebrate. Jules heads to the wedding as well, being given a ride by her mother, who, upon arriving, confronts Jess and accuses her of being a hypocrite and a lesbian. Jules drags her mother away, angrily clarifying her friendship with Jess and her sexual orientation.

Later that day, Jess has still not told her parents about the scholarship; she is afraid they might not allow her to go to the United States on her own. Tony, attempting to help Jess, decides to lie to the family and tell them he will get engaged to Jess as long as she gets to go to any college she wants. The Bhamras happily accept, but Jess immediately confesses the truth. Jess&#x27;s mother ignores Jess&#x27;s heartfelt speech and scolds Jess&#x27;s father for letting Jess leave Pinky&#x27;s wedding. But her father announces he doesn&#x27;t want Jess to suffer as he did and accepts her desire to play football, eventually leading her mother to finally accept it as well. Jess runs to the football field to tell Joe of her parents&#x27; decision. The two almost kiss, but Jess pulls away, saying her parents would object, and that although they had come far enough to let her go to the United States to play, she doesn&#x27;t think they would be able to handle another cultural rebellion from her.

On the day of Jess and Jules&#x27;s flight to the United States, the two are about to board the plane when Joe arrives and confesses his love for Jess. The two kiss secretly and Jess agrees to sort out their relationship (and her parents) when she returns for Christmas. While at the airport, they see David Beckham with his wife Victoria, which Jules takes as a good sign. The two leave through the gate waving happily to their families.

While Jess and Jules are away, they send a team photo indicating their continued success in football. Pinky is revealed to be pregnant and Mr. Bhamra gets back into playing cricket and is seen playing outside with Joe and Pinky&#x27;s husband.

==Cast==
Additionally David and Victoria Beckham appear in non-speaking cameos in the airport scene at the film&#x27;s conclusion, though David Beckham was portrayed by lookalike Andy Harmer due to scheduling conflicts while his wife was played by Gill Penny; the real David Beckham does appear via football archive footage and even in posters at Jess’ bedroom, alongside other Manchester United players such as Ryan Giggs. Other players also appear via archive footage such as Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain in a commercial shown at Jules’ house.

==Production==
Gurinder Chadha co-wrote the script with Guljit Bindra and screenwriting partner Paul Mayeda Berges. Nayar and Chadha actively pursued financing for the film at Sundance Film Festival. Having previously worked with Road Movies, a German production company on several other projects, Nayar approached them and they came on board, followed by British Screen and The Film Council. The film is loosely based on the life of Permi Jhooti.

Helkon SK, formerly known as Redbus, picked up the script. Fox Searchlight Pictures picked up the rights for distribution in the United States at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. For its American cinema release it was suggested that the title of the movie be changed to &quot;Move It Like Mia&quot;, as marketeers were concerned that American audience would be unfamiliar with David Beckham.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on 18 June 2001. A variety of locations around London and Shepperton Studios, Surrey were used for the nine-week shoot, with the semi-final taking place over a three-day period in Hamburg, Germany.

===Casting===
Chadha, who played an active role in casting, chose Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, who would play the two lead roles in the film, while Archie Panjabi and Jonathan Rhys Meyers were in early talks to join the cast. Shaznay Lewis and Anupam Kher were also in final talks. Juliet Stevenson and Frank Harper joined as Paula Paxton and Alan Paxton, mother and father of Jules.

For the role of Jess&#x27;s mother, Mrs Bhamra, Chadha turned to Shaheen Khan, whom she had previously cast in &quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot;. Anupam Kher, a Bollywood actor, was cast as Mr Bhamra, Jess&#x27;s father. Chadha worked with The Football Association and ended up casting actual players from a variety of school teams.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; was released theatrically on 12 April 2002 by Redbus Film Distribution. The film then received a limited theatrical release in the United States on 12 March 2003 by Fox Searchlight Pictures. When originally released in the United Kingdom, it topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next three weekends, before being overtaken by &quot;About a Boy&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD and VHS on 18 November 2002 in Europe by Warner Home Video and released on 30 September 2003 in the United States by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Among the DVD bonus features, several scenes did not make the final release. Some include dialogue from Pinky&#x27;s friends and from Jules, as well as her mother meeting Kevin and his friends outside a shop, which would have been helpful, as Kevin is mentioned three times but is never seen.

On the North American &quot;Billboard&quot; video charts, the film entered the top ten of the Top DVD Sales and Top DVD Rentals charts, at number six on Top VHS Sales, and number seven on Top VHS Rentals.

In the United Kingdom, it was the sixth most-watched film of 2003 on subscription television, with 810,000 viewers on Sky Premier that year. It was later the most-watched film on UK television during the first half of 2005, with viewers on BBC1 during that period. Combined, the film drew at least UK viewership during 2003 and 2005.

The film was released on Blu Ray by VIA VISION of Australia in October 2024.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; surprised critics and met with mostly positive reviews. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 85% based on 154 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The consensus states, &quot;Inspiring, compassionate, and with a sly undercurrent of social commentary, &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; is a lively feel-good movie that genuinely charms.&quot; Metacritic gave the movie a score of 66 based on 32 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that the film &quot;was really full of easy humor, an impeccable sense of milieu that is the result of knowing the culture intimately enough to poke fun at it while understanding its underlying integrity.&quot;

&quot;The Times of India&quot; noted the film&#x27;s social context, saying, &quot;[it] is really about the bending of rules, social paradigms and lives – all to finally curl that ball, bending it like Beckham, through the goalpost of ambition ... The creeping divide shows that Britain is changing, but hasn&#x27;t quite changed yet. The stiff upper lip has traveled miles from the time Chadha&#x27;s father was denied a pint at some pubs at Southall, but like dollops of coagulated spice in badly stirred curry, discrimination crops up to spoil the taste, every now and then, in multi-racial Britain.&quot;

&quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; gave the film a mark of 9 out of 10: the &quot;screenplay not only explores the development of Jess as a person, but also the changing values and culture of NRI teens: Jess&#x27;s urge to break the social norm of the Indian home-maker, her sister&#x27;s (Archie Punjabi) sexually active relationship, and the gay Indian [Tony, played by Ameet Chana].&quot;

&quot;The Hindu&quot; argued, &quot;If ever there is a film that is positive, realistic and yet delightful, then it has to be Dream Production&#x27;s latest venture directed by Gurinder Chadha... Light-hearted, without taking away the considerable substance in terms of values, attitudes and the love for sport, the film just goes to prove that there are ways to be convincing and honest.&quot;

Jamie Russell at the BBC gave it 4 out of 5 stars, and argued that &quot;Mr Beckham ought to be proud to have his name on such a great film.&quot; The British film was distributed by iDream Productions in India, and went on to set the record in India for most tickets sold during a single weekend for a foreign movie.

&quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; has also been favorably received by LGBTQ+ community members and press, with one reviewer from &quot;Vice&quot; noting its discussion of queer themes and symbolic queer undertones. The reviewer also shares: &quot;Keira Knightley told PrideSource that she wants a lesbian &quot;Bend it Like Beckham&quot; sequel and agreed that her and Parminder&#x27;s characters should&#x27;ve ended up together.&quot;

===Box office===
In the United Kingdom, the film grossed over £11million, making it one of the highest-grossing Black/Asian-themed British films. With in US box office revenue, &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; became the highest-grossing Indian-themed film in the United States since &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982). At the time of its release, &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; became the highest-grossing association football themed sports film in the United States; it remains the third highest-grossing film there in this genre (behind &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s the Man&quot;). The film grossed worldwide.

<text>The canvasback (Aythya valisineria) is a species of diving duck, the largest found in North America.

==Taxonomy==
Scottish-American naturalist Alexander Wilson described the canvasback in 1814. The genus name is derived from Greek &quot;aithuia&quot;, an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors, including Hesychius and Aristotle.
The species name &quot;valisineria&quot; comes from the wild celery &quot;Vallisneria americana&quot;, whose winter buds and rhizomes are the canvasback&#x27;s preferred food during the nonbreeding period. The celery genus is itself named for seventeenth century Italian botanist Antonio Vallisneri.

The duck&#x27;s common name is based on early European inhabitants of North America&#x27;s assertion that its back was a canvas-like color. In other languages it is just a &quot;white-backed duck&quot;; for example in French, &quot;morillon à dos blanc&quot;, or Spanish, &quot;pato lomo blanco&quot;. In Mexico it is called &quot;pato coacoxtle&quot;.

==Description==
It ranges from in length and weighs , with a wingspan of . It is the largest species in the genus &quot;Aythya&quot;, and the largest diving duck in North America. Canvasbacks are similar in size to a mallard but with a heavier and more compact build. 191 males wintering in western New York averaged and 54 females there averaged . The canvasback has a distinctive wedge-shaped head and long graceful neck. The adult male (drake) has a black bill, a chestnut red head and neck, a black breast, a grayish back, black rump, and a blackish brown tail. The drake&#x27;s sides, back, and belly are white with fine vermiculation resembling the weave of a canvas, which gave rise to the bird&#x27;s common name. The bill is blackish and the legs and feet are bluish-gray. The iris is bright red in the spring, but duller in the winter. The adult female (hen) also has a black bill, a light brown head and neck, grading into a darker brown chest and foreback. The sides, flanks, and back are grayish brown. The bill is blackish and the legs and feet are bluish-gray. Its sloping profile distinguishes it from other ducks.

==Breeding==
The breeding habitat of the canvasback is in North American prairie potholes. The bulky nest is built from vegetation in a marsh and lined with down. Loss of nesting habitat has caused populations to decline. The canvasback usually takes a new mate each year, pairing in late winter on ocean bays. It prefers to nest over water on permanent prairie marshes surrounded by emergent vegetation, such as cattails and bulrushes, which provide protective cover. Other important breeding areas are the subarctic river deltas in Saskatchewan and the interior of Alaska.

It has a clutch size of approximately 5–11 eggs, which are greenish drab. The chicks are covered in down at hatching and able to leave the nest soon after. The canvasback sometimes lays its eggs in other canvasback nests and redheads often parasitize canvasback nests.
==Migration==
The canvasback migrates through the Mississippi Flyway to wintering grounds in the mid-Atlantic United States and the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), or the Pacific Flyway to wintering grounds along the coast of California. Historically, the Chesapeake Bay wintered the majority of canvasbacks, but with the recent loss of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the bay, their range has shifted south towards the LMAV. Brackish estuarine bays and marshes with abundant submergent vegetation and invertebrates are ideal wintering habitat for canvasbacks. A small number of birds are also known to have crossed the Atlantic, with several sightings being recorded in the United Kingdom. In December 1996, a canvasback was observed in a quarry in Kent, which was followed by an additional sighting in Norfolk in January 1997. At least five more sightings have since been confirmed in England.

==Diet==

The canvasback feeds mainly by diving, sometimes dabbling, mostly eating seeds, buds, leaves, tubers, roots, snails, and insect larvae. Besides its namesake, wild celery, the canvasback shows a preference for the tubers of sago pondweed, which can make up 100% of its diet at times. The canvasback has large webbed feet adapted for diving and its bill helps it dig tubers from the substrate. In the late 1930s, studies showed that four-fifths of the food eaten by canvasbacks was plant material. 

In the early 1950s it was estimated that there were 225,000 canvasbacks wintering in the Chesapeake Bay; this represented one-half of the entire North American population. By 1985, there were only 50,000 ducks wintering there, or one-tenth of the population. Canvasbacks were extensively hunted around the start of the 20th century, but federal hunting regulations now restrict their harvest, so hunting is ruled out as a cause for the decline. Scientists have now concluded that the decline in duck populations was due to the decline in sub-aquatic vegetation acreage. Today the population has stabilized and is even increasing slightly, although it is nowhere near previous levels. Studies have now shown that by the 1970s four-fifths of the ducks&#x27; diet was made up of Baltic Clams, which are very common in the Chesapeake Bay: the ducks have been able to adapt to the decline in sub-aquatic vegetation by changing their diet. Redheads, which also feed on the tubers of sub-aquatic vegetation, have not been able to adapt, and their population remains low.

==Cuisine==

Canvasback ducks were a particularly prestigious game dish in mid-19th-century America. They were rarely found on everyday menus, and often featured at banquets. They were generally sourced from Maryland and Chesapeake Bay, and their flavor was attributed to their diet of wild celery. By the end of the century, though, they had become &quot;scarce, expensive, or unobtainable&quot;.

Edith Wharton refers to canvasback with blackcurrant sauce as an especially luxurious dinner served in New York City in the 1870s. Canvasback duck was a canonical element, along with Terrapin à la Maryland, of the elegant &quot;Maryland Feast&quot; menu, an &quot;elite standard... that lasted for decades&quot;.

==Conservation==
Populations have fluctuated widely. Low levels in the 1980s put the canvasback on lists of special concern, but numbers increased greatly in the 1990s. The canvasback is particularly vulnerable to drought and wetland drainage on the prairies of North America.

Many species of ducks, including the canvasback, are highly migratory, but are effectively conserved by protecting the places where they nest, even though they may be hunted away from their breeding grounds. Protecting key feeding and breeding grounds is key for conserving many types of migratory birds.

<doc id="249885" wikidata="Q7833464" url="?curid=249885" title="Tranquility Bay">
<text>Tranquility Bay was a residential treatment facility affiliated with World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools (WWASPS), located in Calabash Bay, Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica. The facility operated from 1997 to 2009 and received notoriety for its harsh and often abusive treatment of its students, eventually shutting down in 2009 after allegations of child abuse came to light through lawsuits and highly publicized student testimonies. The adolescents reported violence to their parents, only to be ignored. 

==History==
The director was Jay Kay, a college dropout with no training in child development who ran a mini-mart in San Diego, and who is son of WWASPS president Ken Kay. The cost for one child ranged from $25,000 to $40,000 a year. Tranquility Bay was generally acknowledged as the toughest of the WWASPS schools. As with other WWASPS facilities, Tranquility Bay has been the subject of much controversy, including allegations of torture, unsanitary living conditions, unqualified employees, and denial of medical care; these claims have been the subject of multiple lawsuits from former Tranquility Bay residents.

In 1998 was the focus of a legal case after neighbors of a family reported parents to police for kidnapping and false imprisonment by sending him to Tranquility Bay. Judge Ken Kawaichi denied the writ of habeas corpus due to lack of evidence of abuse at Tranquility bay.

Tranquility Bay stated that it was dedicated to helping parents who are having difficulty with their children, whether they are doing drugs, breaking the law, or being disobedient or disrespectful. In 2003, Kay said &quot;if I have kids, and they start giving me a problem, well, they are going straight in the program. If I had to, I&#x27;d pull the trigger without hesitation&quot;; however, in 1999, Kay (who at that time was not working for WWASPS) said that the Tranquility Bay staff were &quot;untrained&quot;, without &quot;credentials of any kind&quot;, and that Tranquility Bay &quot;could be leading these kids to long-term problems that we don&#x27;t have a clue about because we&#x27;re not going about it in the proper way&quot;.

Children as young as 12 were admitted to Tranquility Bay, for reasons ranging from drug use to conflicts with a new stepmother. From 2002 to 2005 the Government of the Cayman Islands sent some delinquent youth to Tranquility Bay; the government funded the students as they were located in Tranquility Bay.

On the 7th of December 2004 the British Broadcasting Company aired a program on BBC Two called &quot;Locked in Paradise&quot;.

Tranquility Bay was shut down in January 2009, after the case of Isaac Hersh gained national media and political attention and years of alleged abuse and torture came to light. Many politicians, including Hillary Clinton, were involved in Isaac&#x27;s release.

== Controversies ==

=== Observation Placement ===
Observation Placement was a punishment that could demote any student to level one and take away all their points. During Observation Placement, people were forced to lay down on their faces. Some people spent 18 months in this punishment.

=== Transportation ===
Tranquility bay used teen escort companies to facilitate the transportation of youths from the United States of America to their facility in Jamaica. This would normally take place in the early hours of the morning and often involved the use of handcuffs.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Cassie&quot; episode of the A&amp;E program &quot;Intervention&quot;, first shown in January 2011, features a young woman addicted to prescription painkillers who had been sent to Tranquility Bay as a child and blamed her father for not rescuing her. In the episode, Cassie alleged that her fellow residents consumed &quot;chemicals&quot; so they would be sent to the hospital and would be able to talk to their parents regarding the abuse they were enduring. However, she alleged that when they vomited in response to the poison, rather than being sent to a hospital, they were restrained by staff face down in their own vomit.

<doc id="249886" wikidata="Q918650" url="?curid=249886" title="Leonard Adleman">
<text>Leonard Adleman (born December 31, 1945) is an American computer scientist. He is one of the creators of the RSA encryption algorithm, for which he received the 2002 Turing Award. He is also known for the creation of the field of DNA computing and coining the term computer virus.

== Biography ==
Leonard M. Adleman was born to a Jewish family in California. His family had originally immigrated to the United States from modern-day Belarus, from the Minsk area. He grew up in San Francisco and attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his B.A. degree in mathematics in 1968 and his Ph.D. degree in EECS in 1976. He was also the mathematical consultant on the movie &quot;Sneakers&quot;. In 1996, he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering for contributions to the theory of computation and cryptography. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Adleman is also an amateur boxer and has sparred with James Toney.

== Discovery ==
In 1994, his paper &quot;Molecular Computation of Solutions To Combinatorial Problems&quot; described the experimental use of DNA as a computational system. In it, he solved a seven-node instance of the Hamiltonian Graph problem, an NP-complete problem similar to the travelling salesman problem. While the solution to a seven-node instance is trivial, this paper is the first known instance of the successful use of DNA to compute an algorithm. DNA computing has been shown to have potential as a means to solve several other large-scale combinatorial search problems. Adleman is widely referred to as the Father of DNA Computing.

In 2002, he and his research group managed to solve a &#x27;nontrivial&#x27; problem using DNA computation. Specifically, they solved a 20-variable SAT problem having more than 1 million potential solutions. They did it in a manner similar to the one Adleman used in his seminal 1994 paper. First, a mixture of DNA strands logically representative of the problem&#x27;s solution space was synthesized. This mixture was then operated upon algorithmically using biochemical techniques to winnow out the &#x27;incorrect&#x27; strands, leaving behind only those strands that &#x27;satisfied&#x27; the problem. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of these remaining strands revealed &#x27;correct&#x27; solutions to the original problem.

He is one of the original discoverers of the Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test.

Fred Cohen, in his 1984 paper, &quot;Experiments with Computer Viruses&quot; credited Adleman with coining the term &quot;computer virus&quot;. 

As of 2017, Adleman is working on the mathematical theory of Strata. He is a Computer Science professor at the University of Southern California.

== Awards ==
For his contribution to the invention of the RSA cryptosystem, Adleman, along with Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir, has been a recipient of the 1996 Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award and the 2002 Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of Computer Science. Adleman was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2006 and a 2021 ACM Fellow.

<doc id="249888" wikidata="Q632106" url="?curid=249888" title="Royal Radar Establishment">
<text>The Royal Radar Establishment was a research centre in Malvern, Worcestershire in the United Kingdom. It was formed in 1953 as the Radar Research Establishment by the merger of the Air Ministry&#x27;s Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and the British Army&#x27;s Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE). It was given its new name after a visit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. Both names were abbreviated to RRE. In 1976 the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE), involved in communications research, joined the RRE to form the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE).

The two groups had been closely associated since before the opening of World War II, when the predecessor to RRDE was formed as a small group within the Air Ministry&#x27;s research centre in Bawdsey Manor in Suffolk. Forced to leave Bawdsey due to its exposed location on the east coast of England, both groups moved several times before finally settling in separate locations in Malvern beginning in May 1942. The merger in 1953 that formed the RRE renamed these as the North Site (RRDE) and South Site (TRE).

The earlier research and development work of TRE and RRDE on radar was expanded into solid state physics, electronics, and computer hardware and software. The RRE&#x27;s overall scope was extended to include cryogenics and other topics. Infrared detection for guided missiles and heat sensing devices was a major defence application. The SRDE brought satellite communications and fibre optics knowledge.

In 1991 they were partially privatized as part of the Defence Research Agency, which became the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency in 1996. The North Site was closed in 2003 and the work was consolidated at the South Site, while the former North Site was sold off for housing developments. Qinetiq now occupies a part of the former RSRE site.

==Administrative history==
The earliest concerted effort to develop radar in the UK dates to 1935, and Robert Watt replied to an Air Ministry question about radio-based death rays by stating they were impossible, but using radio as a detection means was possible. After a simple practical demonstration, a prototype system was built at Orfordness on the east coast of England. While on a Sunday drive in the area, Watt noticed the large and unused Bawdsey Manor, and this was leased by the Air Ministry to become first radar research centre in the country. Soon after taking over Bawdsey in 1936, the British Army heard of their efforts and formed a group to work with them to develop ground-based applications. The first project of this &quot;Army Cell&quot; was a ranging system for anti-aircraft artillery, but they soon added the Coast Defence radars and began work on the proximity fuse.

At the outbreak of the war in 1939, the location of Bawdsey, right on the east coast, was considered far too exposed to attack. The Air Ministry team quickly moved to Dundee in Scotland, where the former Air Ministry Experimental Station became the Air Ministry Research Establishment (AMRE). The Army group moved to Christchurch, outside Bournemouth, becoming the Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE). The facilities in Dundee proved far too small and isolated, and in May 1940 they moved again, this time to Worth Matravers on the south coast of England, also a short distance from Bournemouth. This was accompanied by yet another renaming, now becoming the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE).

Ultimately they began to worry that this location was also too exposed, and when they heard a German paratroop unit had moved to France directly across the English Channel, they decided to move once again. The ADEE, by this time once again renamed to the Air Defence Research and Development (ADRDE), moved to underutilized Air Ministry buildings on the north side of Malvern in May 1942. This, of course, resulted in yet another name change to the RRDE. The TRE followed shortly thereafter, taking up residence in buildings across from Malvern College on the south side of town.

TRE was part of the Ministry of Supply and, when it was formed, so was RRE. In 1959, control passed to the Ministry of Aviation. When this was abolished in 1967, control passed to the Ministry of Technology, then to the Ministry of Aviation Supply, in 1970, and to the Ministry of Defence in 1971. In 1976 RRE merged with the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) to form the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), which became part of the Defence Research Agency (DRA) in 1991. Later (1995), DRA was absorbed into DERA, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. DERA split on 2 June 2001 into two parts, a government body called Dstl (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) and a company destined for privatisation, which became QinetiQ.

The technical departments of RRE were grouped, initially, into six Divisions: airborne radar, ground radar, guided weapons, basic techniques, physics, and engineering. The organization and personnel are described further, in a collection of linked web sites.

W. J. Richards, CBE, was Director of TRE at the time of the merger and continued as Director of RRE. William Henry (Bill) Penley, Head of Guided Missiles, took over for a year in 1961. Then George Macfarlane (after postings outside RRE) became Director in 1962.

==The Physics Division – some of the staff and their work==
At the time of the name change to Radar Research Establishment in 1953, the senior staff included:
*Robert Allan Smith (known as R.A. and as Robin). He was Head of the Physics Division, with a staff of about 150. Having worked previously on aspects of radio and radar, his attention had become focused on solid state physics, because of the importance of semiconductors in the development of electronics and infra-red detectors. His early books had dealt with radionavigation, aerials for short wave radio, and thermodynamics. After the name change to RRE, his &quot;most significant book, in historical terms&quot;, on the detection of infra-red radiation, was coauthored with F. E. Jones and R. P. Chasmar and published in 1968. The book &quot;for which [he] is best known&quot; is on semiconductors. His other books dealt with wave mechanics of crystalline solids, and, as editor, very high resolution spectroscopy. He left RRE to become Professor of Physics at the University of Sheffield in 1961, came to MIT as Director of the Center for Materials Science and Engineering a year later, and became Vice-Chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in 1968, retiring in 1974. He was an FRS, an FRSE, and received an OBE.
*George G. Macfarlane. He held a special appointment as Superintendent of the Physics Department, having been assigned to direct the work in theoretical physics. He had been trained as an electrical engineer, and had worked on theoretical aspects of radar prior to the name change of the establishment. One of the designers of the Royal Radar Establishment Automatic Computer. Later, he became Deputy Director of the National Physical Laboratory, then Director of RRE, then Controller of Research at the Ministry of Technology and then Defence. He was knighted for his work.
*R. P. Chasmar, Head of the infra-red group and co-author of the book mentioned above.
*Tom Elliott (Charles Thomas Elliott), physicist, at RRE from the late 1960s through transition to DERA. He invented the SPRITE detector, and contributed to the development of cadmium mercury telluride  as an industrial semiconductor. The &quot;Tom Elliott Conference Centre&quot; at the site is named in his honour. He was made an FRS and CBE, received a Rank medal, and joined Heriot-Watt University. Elected Fellow of the Royal Society.
*Alan F. Gibson. Head of Transistor Group at RRE, then the first Professor of Physics at the University of Essex in 1963, and later Head of Laser Division of Rutherford Laboratory (1975–1983). He was named Fellow of the Royal Society in 1978.
*Cyril Hilsum, physicist. Work in industrial and government laboratories and in academe includes theoretical solid state physics and development of liquid crystals. Elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and Fellow of the Royal Society, recipient of Max Born Prize and Faraday Medal.
*Edward G. S. Paige. Worked on semiconductors, with Denis Maines turned to Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, led team that received Wolfe Medal of MOD and earned RRE a Queen&#x27;s Award, later Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Oxford, awarded Rayleigh Medal and Duddell Medal.
*Leo Pincherle. Head of the theoretical solid state physics group, and authority on band structure theory. His monograph on this topic was published in 1971. He also published a standard text on heat and thermodynamics, during his later appointment as Professor of Physics at Bedford College, London.
* Albert M. Uttley, mathematician, computer scientist and experimental psychologist. Designed AI trainer, the TREAC digital computer, and contributed to early discussions of cybernetics. Continued human factors work at National Physical Laboratory and then as Research Professor in the Experimental Psychology Laboratory of the University of Sussex.
*Philip Woodward had pioneered the application of probability theory to the filtering of radar signals, and wrote a monograph on the topic. His results included the Woodward Ambiguity Function, &quot;the standard tool for waveform and matched filter analysis&quot;. He continued to direct theoretical work on radar after the establishment changed its name. Later, he led the group that developed the Coral 66 computer programming language. He was, at different times, Honorary Professor in Electrical Engineering at the University of Birmingham and visiting professor in Cybernetics at the University of Reading. In 2000, the Woodward Building named in his honour was opened on the site that had then become DERA by Sir John Chisholm. In 2005, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Royal Academy of Engineering. In 2009, he received the Dennis J. Picard Medal of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), for Radar Technologies and Applications.

Other members of the Physics Division who made significant contributions to several fields of endeavour include:
*William Bardsley, physicist. His work at Malvern on growing crystals was published in a series of papers that have been referenced over 200 times through the time of writing (2010), in work on semiconductor devices and, in one instance, space science.
*Michael P. Barnett, (1929–2012). At Malvern he worked on theory of semiconductors, including organic materials. Later, he taught at MIT, the University of London, Columbia University and City University of New York. His earlier publications on several topics has been followed by more recent work on computational chemistry and symbolic calculation.
*Paul N. Butcher, theoretical solid state physics. After working at Malvern, he was appointed to a chair at the University of Warwick, and has published four books.
*Geoffrey V. Chester, theoretical physicist. At Malvern (1953–54), he worked on mathematical problems of radar. Later, at Cornell University, he was Director of the Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics (1968–74) and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences (1986–91).
*J. B. Gunn, solid state physicist. At Malvern he worked on the physics of electronic devices. Later, at the IBM Research Laboratories in the U.S., he discovered the Gunn effect used in the Gunn diode.

*Several staff members under the supervision of Cyril Hilsum, in conjunction with George Gray and Ken Harrison of the University of Hull, developed new, stable liquid crystals in 1972, which were an immediate success as the basis of display devices in the electronics and consumer products industries. This received the Queen&#x27;s Award for Technological Achievement in 1979. Patents from this development yielded royalties over £100 million, the largest of any MOD patent.
*William D. Lawson, co-recipient of Rank Prize for Optoelectronics in 1976,
*Trevor Simpson Moss, solid state physicist, author of definitive monographs &quot;Photoconductivity of the elements&quot; and &quot;Optical Properties of semiconductors&quot;, and series editor of &quot;Handbook on Semiconductors&quot; of the North-Holland Publishing Company.
*S. Nielson, co-recipient of Rank Prize for Optoelectronics in 1976,
*J. Michael Radcliffe, theoretical physicist. Later, he turned to academe at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in the U.S., and he was listed as coauthor in a revised edition of Born&#x27;s &quot;Atomic Physics&quot;.
*Dennis Sciama, later cosmologist and FRS. At RRE he coauthored work on band structure calculations.
*A.S. Young, co-recipient of Rank Prize for Optoelectronics in 1976.

In 1956, R.A. Smith presented a comprehensive account of the contributions of RRE to physics to the Royal Society.

==Radar, Guided weapons and Engineering Divisions==

Although less conspicuous among academic scientists, these divisions were major players in the defence community, both in policy decision making and as an interface with industry. Development and production contracts brought staff of several companies on site, and extramural contracts strengthened ties with industry still further. &quot;in radar alone: Plessey and Decca for aerials and waveguides, Plessey, Hilger &amp; Watts, Clarke Chapman and Curran for millimetre-wave radar, and Mullard for precision bombing and radar reconnaissance&quot;. On returning to RRE as Director in 1962, George Macfarlane reorganized the technical departments into: Military and Civil Systems (comprising Ground Radar and Air Traffic Control, Guided Weapons and Airborne Radar groups), Physics and Electronics (comprising Physics and Electronic Groups) and Engineering. &quot;Despite the policy shift away from fighters ... to guided weapons for UK air defence, ... RRE continued to argue for strike aircraft and kept up the necessary radar research programs.&quot;

In December 1968, the report on the programming language ALGOL 68 was published. On 20–24 July 1970, a working conference was arranged by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) to discuss the problems of implementing the language. A small team from RRE attended to present their compiler, written by I. F. Currie, Susan G. Bond, and J. D. Morrison. ALGOL 68 was complex: implementing it was estimated to need up to 100 man-years, using multi-pass compilers with up to seven passes. The RRE team described how they had already implemented a one-pass compiler, which was already in production for engineering and scientific uses. It was the first working version of ALGOL 68.

Senior staff, of the divisions at various times included
*G.W.A (Geoffrey) Dummer, electronics engineer. His early work is described in the TRE article. His oversight of the large contingent of electronics contractors continued, and he was appointed Superintendent of Applied Physics. In 1964 he sponsored a symposium on Electronic Beam Techniques for Microelectronics at R.R.E. He published over 30 books, was responsible for much further publishing on electronics. He was awarded an MBE, the American Medal of Freedom, the Wakefield Gold Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the Cledo Brunetti Award of the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers
*W. H. (Bill) Penley, physicist. Head of Guided Weapons at time of name change. Later Director of RRE, then Controller of Establishments and Research – responsible for the whole Defence research programme.
*John Robert Mills joined TRE in 1939 as a post grad physicist, working initially on radar development and later, as a member of the (Offensive) Airborne Radar Division, the development of infra-red and radar targeting and reconnaissance systems. He left RRE in 1960 and spent about a year at the Ministry of Defence (MOD), London followed by five years as head of Radio Department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment in Farnborough before becoming Director of Signal Research and Development Establishment in Christchurch. He returned to RRE, which became the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE), in 1976 as Deputy Director until his retirement in 1977.

More than 50 books were written by members of the establishment under its successive names. Details are included in the list of references below, and in the TRE article. Many more were in series that members of the staff edited.

In 1968, the Minister of Supply assured a member of parliament that the results of research at RRE on infra-red detectors would be made available to British industry.

A former member of the RRE, Martin Woodhouse, later became better known as a novelist.

<text>Who Moved My Cheese? An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life is a 1998 motivational business fable by Spencer Johnson that describes four reactions to change. The book is written as a parable about two mice and two &quot;Littlepeople&quot; during their hunt for cheese. A &quot;New York Times&quot; business bestseller upon release, &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; remained on the list for almost five years and spent over 200 weeks on &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s hardcover nonfiction list. As of 2018, it has sold almost 30 million copies worldwide in 37 languages and remains one of the best-selling business books.

==Summary==
Several high school classmates meet after a class reunion and discuss the challenge of handling the changes in their lives. Michael, a business manager, says that he was afraid of change until he heard an allegorical story, which he proceeds to tell.

In the story, two mice and two &quot;littlepeople&quot; — people the size of mice — live in a maze. The mice, named Sniff and Scurry, are simpleminded and instinctive; they run the same path every day, eating cheese when they find it, but are always ready to move on. The littlepeople, Hem and Haw, search for a special kind of Cheese that makes them happy and fulfilled by keeping track of where they have found it before. All four discover a spot where their favorite cheese is regularly available, called Cheese Station C. The mice continue to run the entire maze each day while the littlepeople stop exploring and settle at Cheese Station C.

One day the supply at Cheese Station C is exhausted. The mice accept that there is no more cheese and continue their running path. The littlepeople sit at the station confused and upset. Hem protests that there ought to be Cheese, and Haw wonders where the mice have gone. Meanwhile, the mice find new supply of cheese at Cheese Station N. The littlepeople remain at Cheese Station C for several days, growing frustrated and hungry. Eventually Haw accepts that running the maze is the only way he will ever have Cheese again, faces his fear of moving on, and leaves Hem behind.

Haw finds crumbs of Cheese scattered around the maze and some other Cheese Stations that are already depleted. He returns to Cheese Station C and tells Hem there is other Cheese, but Hem refuses to budge. Haw continues exploring, writing observations about his journey on the walls of the maze, until he arrives at Cheese Station N which is stocked with all kinds of Cheese.

Haw reflects on the lessons he has learned and hopes that Hem will finally let go of his doubts. On the wall of Cheese Station N, he writes several lessons that change is inevitable and keeping up with it is the only way to continue having Cheese. Cautious from past experience, Haw inspects Cheese Station N daily and explores different parts of the maze regularly to prevent complacency. Hearing movement in the maze one day, Haw realizes someone is approaching the station and hopes it is his friend Hem.

After Michael finishes the story, the classmates agree to meet again before dinner and discuss it. They tell different stories of encountering change and how they, or someone else, failed to respond to it. All of them agree that the Cheese story is a useful parable to follow and tell their friends.

==Who Moved My Cheese Inc.==

In 1999, Who Moved My Cheese Inc was founded to handle the &quot;Who Moved My Cheese?&quot; book order demands from businesses. In 2005, the company was reorganized as Spencer Johnson Partners with the idea of bringing in partners and additional content from Dr. Spencer Johnson, the author. Spencer Johnson Partners focused on creating additional programs and services that would continue to help clients navigate change, including Gaining Change Skills. Then, in 2009, the company was purchased and renamed Red Tree leadership.

==Reception==
In the corporate environment, management has been known to distribute this book to employees during times of &quot;structural reorganization&quot;, or during cost-cutting measures, in an attempt to portray unfavorable or unfair changes in an optimistic or opportunistic way. This has been characterized by Barbara Ehrenreich in her book &quot;Bright-sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America&quot; as an attempt by organizational management to make employees quickly and unconditionally assimilate management ideals, even if they may prove detrimental to them professionally. Ehrenreich called the book &quot;the classic of downsizing propaganda&quot; and summarizes its message as &quot;the dangerous human tendencies to &#x27;overanalyze&#x27; and complain must be overcome for a more rodentlike approach to life. When you lose a job, just shut up and scamper along to the next one.&quot;

Liberal journalist Thomas Frank situated the book in a broader genre of management-serving literature that portrays the imbalance of power between employees and managers as an inevitable force of &quot;change&quot; that employees must not question, and should even accept happily. Change comes, mysteriously, from outside the maze while the possibility of the inhabitants effecting change on their terms is rendered unthinkable.

&quot;Dilbert&quot; cartoonist Scott Adams said that patronizing parables are one of the top things he receives complaints about by email. Adams&#x27; retort to the message in the parable is that it is a &quot;patronizing message for the proletariat to acquiesce&quot;.

==Parodies==
There are multiple parody works called &quot;Who Cut the Cheese?&quot;.

*Andy Borowitz published a parody, &quot;Who Moved My Soap?: The CEO&#x27;s Guide to Surviving Prison&quot;, Simon &amp; Schuster, c2003.
*Darrel Bristow-Bovey published a parody, &quot;I Moved Your Cheese&quot;, Penguin Random House South Africa, Apr 13, 2012.
*Comedian/TV host/motivational speaker Ross Shafer wrote &quot;Nobody Moved Your Cheese!&quot;

<doc id="249896" wikidata="Q221711" url="?curid=249896" title="Steyr AUG">
<text>The Steyr AUG () is an Austrian bullpup assault rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO intermediate cartridge, designed in the 1960s by Steyr-Daimler-Puch, and now manufactured by Steyr Arms GmbH &amp; Co KG.

It was adopted by the Austrian Army in 1977 as the StG 77 (&quot;Sturmgewehr 77&quot;), where it replaced the 7.62×51mm NATO StG 58 automatic rifle. In production since 1977, it is the standard small arm of the &quot;Bundesheer&quot; and various Austrian federal police units and its variants have also been adopted by the armed forces of dozens of countries, with some using it as a standard-issue service rifle.

Steyr AUG importation into the United States began in the 1980s as the AUG/SA (SA denoting semi-automatic). The AUG was banned from importation in 1989 under President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s executive order restricting the import of foreign-made semiautomatic rifles deemed not to have &quot;a legitimate sporting use.&quot; Six years into the ban, AUG buyers gained a reprieve as cosmetic changes to the carbine&#x27;s design allowed importation once again. Changes included redesigning its pistol grip into a thumbhole stock, and leaving its barrel unthreaded to prevent attachment of a flash hider or suppressor.

The Federal Assault Weapons Ban, passed in 1994, further prohibited the manufacture of additional Steyr AUGs or their copies. The ban expired in 2004, and in 2008, Steyr Arms worked with Sabre Defence to produce parts legally in the U.S.

==Design details==
The Steyr AUG is a selective-fire, bullpup assault rifle with a conventional gas-piston-operated action that fires from a closed bolt. It is designed as a Modular Weapon System that could be quickly configured as an assault rifle, a carbine, a submachine gun and even an open-bolt light machine gun.

The AUG is chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and has the standard 1:9 rifling twist that will stabilise both SS109/M855 and M193 rounds. Some nations including Australia, Ireland and New Zealand use a version with a 1:7 twist optimised for the SS109 NATO round. The submachine gun variants are chambered in either 9×19mm Parabellum or .40 S&amp;W.

The AUG consists of six interchangeable assemblies: the barrel, receiver with integrated telescopic sight or Picatinny rail, bolt carrier assembly, trigger mechanism, stock and magazine. The AUG employs a very high level of advanced firearms technology and is made with the extensive use of polymers and aluminium components.

The AUG comes with a muzzle cap, spare bolt for left-handed shooters, blank-firing adaptor, cleaning kit, sling and either an American M7 or German KCB-77 M1 bayonet.

===Operating mechanism===

The AUG has a rotating bolt that features 7 radial locking lugs and is unlocked through a pin on the bolt body and a recessed camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier itself is guided by two guide rods brazed to it and these rods run inside steel bearings in the receiver. The guide rods are hollow and contain the return springs. The bolt also contains a claw extractor that forms the eighth locking lug and a spring-loaded &quot;bump&quot;-type casing ejector.

The gas cylinder is offset to the right side of the barrel and works with one of the two guide rods. The AUG uses a short-stroke piston system where the right guide rod serves as the action rod, transmitting the rearward motion of the gas-driven piston to the bolt carrier. The left-hand rod provides retracting handle pressure when connected by the forward assist and can also be utilised as a reamer to remove fouling in the gas cylinder. The firearm uses a 3-position gas valve. The first setting, marked with a small dot, is used for normal operation. The second setting, illustrated with a large dot, indicates fouled conditions. The third, &quot;GR&quot; closed position is used to launch rifle grenades (of the non-bullet trap type).

The AUG is hammer-fired and the firing mechanism is contained in the rear of the stock, near the butt, covered by a synthetic rubber shoulder plate. The hammer group is made entirely of plastics except for the springs and pins and is contained in an open-topped plastic box which lies between the magazine and the buttplate. During firing the recoiling bolt group travels over the top of it, resetting the hammer. Since the trigger is located some distance away, it transmits its energy through a sear lever which passes by the side of the magazine. The firing pin is operated by a plastic hammer under pressure from a coil spring.

=== Engineering ===
The quick-change barrel used in the AUG is cold hammer-forged for increased precision and durability, its bore, chamber and certain components of the gas system are chrome-plated (currently nitride on US market rifles). The standard rifle-length barrel features 6 right-hand grooves and a rifling twist rate of 228 mm (1:9 in). An external sleeve is shrunk on to the barrel and carries the gas port and cylinder, gas valve and forward grip hinge jaw. There is a short cylinder which contains a piston and its associated return spring. The barrel locks into a steel insert inside the receiver through a system of eight lugs arranged around the chamber end and is equipped with a folding vertical grip that helps to pivot and withdraw the barrel during barrel changes. The most compact of the barrels has a fixed vertical grip.

The receiver housing is a steel-reinforced aluminium extrusion finished with a baked enamel coating. It holds the steel bearings for the barrel lugs and the guide rods. The non-reciprocating plastic cocking handle works in a slot on the left side of the receiver and is connected to the bolt carrier&#x27;s left guide rod. The cocking handle has a forward assist feature—alternatively called a &quot;silent cocking device&quot;—allowing the user to fully push the bolt home without racking the charging handle. A bolt hold-open device locks the bolt carrier back after the last round has been fired. The newer AUG A3s feature a bolt release button; prior to this development, all AUGs and the USR required the user to rack the charging handle to disengage the bolt hold-open after inserting a fresh magazine. Older versions of the AUG can be upgraded to use the newer A3 stock and hammer pack.

The rifle&#x27;s stock is made from fibreglass-reinforced polyamide 66. At the forward end is the pistol grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip, together with its two operating rods which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is the locking catch for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, on the underside of the stock. Above the housing are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a removable strip of plastic. The rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.

=== Features ===
==== Receivers ====

The AUG&#x27;s receiver can be changed from the standard model with a carrying handle and built-in 1.5× optical sight to the &#x27;Special Receiver&#x27; which has a STANAG scope mount to allow for the use of a variety of scopes and sights. In later models (A2 and A3), it has several different types of receivers with Picatinny rails.

==== Sights ====

The AUG has a 1.5× telescopic sight that is integrated with the receiver casting and is made by Swarovski Optik. It contains a simple black ring reticle. The sight cannot be set to a specific range but can be adjusted for windage and elevation for an initial zero and is designed to be calibrated for 300 m. It also has a backup iron sight with a rear notch and front blade, cast into the top of the aluminium optical sight housing, in case of failure or damage to the primary optical sight. The sight is also equipped with a set of three illuminated dots (one on the front blade and two at the rear) for use in low-level lighting conditions. In order to mount a wide range of optics and accessories, a receiver with a NATO-standard Picatinny rail and detachable carrying handle was also developed and introduced in December 1997. Modern AUGs are equipped with, or can have the Picatinny rail swapped out with, an A3SF 60mm height x3 optic with optional riser and additional crosshair within the &quot;donut&quot; black ring. This specific optic can be piggybacked with other optics on top, as is the norm with Austrian special forces, due to the Picatinny rail included on top of the optic.

==== Stock ====
While the AUG is not fully ambidextrous, it can be configured to be used by left- or right-handed operators by changing the bolt to one that has the extractor and ejector on the appropriate side and moving the blanking plate to cover the ejection port not in use. However, there exists also a right-hand-only stock that allows for the use of STANAG magazines.

==== Ammunition and magazine ====

The AUG is fed from a detachable proprietary translucent-polymer double-column box magazine with either a 30- or 42-round capacity. Optional NATO stock for STANAG magazine compatibility is also available.

==== Firing mechanism ====
The AUG&#x27;s firing mechanism can also be changed at will, into a variety of configurations, including semi-auto and full-auto, semi-auto and three-round-burst, semi-auto-only, or any other combination that the user desires. It can also be converted into an open-bolt full-auto-only mode of fire, which allows for improved cooling and eliminates cook off problems when the AUG is used as a light machine gun.

====Trigger====
The AUG features a progressive trigger (pulling the trigger halfway produces semi-automatic fire, pulling the trigger all the way to the rear produces fully automatic fire), and a safety mechanism (cross-bolt, button type) located immediately above the hand grip. In its &quot;safe&quot; position (white dot), the trigger is mechanically disabled; pressing the safety button to the left exposes a red dot and indicates the weapon is ready to fire. Some versions have an ALO or &quot;automatic lockout&quot;, a small projection at the base of the trigger. This was first included on the Irish Defence Forces variant of the rifle, and soon after, the Australian Defence Forces variant. In the exposed position, the ALO stops the trigger being squeezed past the semi-automatic position. If needed, the ALO can be pushed up to permit automatic fire.

==== Barrels and muzzle devices ====

The AUG features quick detachable barrels and are available in different lengths; including a compact length, carbine length and standard rifle-length. The muzzle device primarily used for these barrel lengths is a three-pronged, open-type flash suppressor. The flash suppressors are screwed to the muzzle and internally threaded to take a blank-firing attachment. AUGs equipped with the pattern barrels produced for military purposes are also equipped with bayonet lugs. The and barrels are capable of launching NATO STANAG type 22 mm rifle grenades from their integral flash hiders without the use of an adapter. AUG barrels can also mount 40 mm M203 or AG36 grenade launchers. Steyr also offers barrel configurations fitted with a fixed, post front-sight used on the rifle version with aperture iron sights. A heavy barrel with an integrated lightweight folding bipod with a closed-type ported muzzle device (combination of flash suppressor and compensator) is also available, primarily used on the AUG HBAR.

==Variants==
=== AUG ===


The Steyr AUG can also be fitted with either an M203 or AG-C grenade launcher.
*The Steyr AUG A1 is fitted with an integral 1.5x optic and is available with a choice of olive or black furniture.
*The Steyr AUG A2, introduced in December 1997, features a redesigned charging handle and a detachable telescopic sight which can be replaced with a Picatinny rail. Its modularity allows a 24.4-inch barrel to be used, and the folding grip can be replaced with a Picatinny rail section, to which a bipod can be installed.
*The Steyr AUG A3 features a Picatinny rail on top of the receiver and an external bolt release. In 2019, Steyr Arms introduced a .300 AAC Blackout variant of the AUG A3.
**The Steyr AUG A3 SF features a Picatinny rail mounted on the telescopic sight and on the right side of the receiver, and includes an external bolt release. The integrated telescopic sight is offered in 1.5× or 3× magnification.
**The Steyr AUG A3-CQC was a cancelled prototype development of the AUG A3 and was first displayed by Steyr at the SHOT Show in 2006 and 2007. It differs in having a railed handguard attached ahead of the receiver and features an barrel. Because this extra railed section needed to be removed to strip the rifle for cleaning, the left side featured a quick detach lever. Due to the concerns over the extra cost and weight, along with potential issues with the reliability and consistency of the detachable handguard, the prototypes received little interest and were last seen promoted by Steyr in 2008. In 2012, the American company PJA obtained the five original prototypes from Steyr and reverse engineered them in order to produce a US-made AUG A3-CQC and conversion kits.

=== AUG HBAR ===
The Steyr AUG HBAR (Heavy Barrelled Automatic Rifle), also known as the AUG LMG (light machine gun), is essentially an automatic rifle variant of the AUG. It features a heavier and longer barrel with an integrated bipod, and the standard AUG receiver with 1.5× magnification scope. It fires from an open bolt to be more suitable for sustained fire, mitigating accidental cook offs. To accomplish this, it uses a modified bolt carrier, striker and trigger mechanism with sear.

*The Steyr AUG HBAR-T (Heavy Barrelled Automatic Rifle-Telescope) is similar to the AUG HBAR, but features a special receiver with a STANAG scope mount system usually fitted with a Schmidt &amp; Bender 4×25 or Kahles ZF69 6×42 optical sight.

=== AUG 9mm ===
The Steyr AUG 9mm, also known as the AUG Para, is a submachine gun variant of the AUG chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and has been produced since 1988. It differs from the rifle variants by having a unique barrel with six right-hand grooves at a 250 mm (1:9.8 in) rifling twist rate, with a recoil compensator, a slightly different charging handle, and a magazine well adapter enabling the use of Steyr MPi 69 25- and 32-round box magazines. It is blowback-operated and fires from a closed bolt, omitting the original rifle&#x27;s gas system. A conversion kit used to transform any assault rifle configuration into the submachine gun configuration is also available. The conversion kit consists of a barrel, bolt, adapter insert, and magazine.
* The Steyr AUG A3 9mm XS is a 9×19mm variant of the AUG A3. It fires at a cyclic rate of around 650–720 rounds per minute. It is available in either a , , , barrel lengths, and features a Picatinny rail system similar to the AUG A3.
* The Steyr AUG 40 is a .40 S&amp;W variant of the AUG A3 9mm XS that uses Glock-compatible double-stack .40 S&amp;W magazines. It is offered with a barrel.

=== Austrian adopted variants ===

The StG 77 (Sturmgewehr 77) is the designation given by the Austrian Armed Forces when they adopted the Steyr AUG in 1977.

*The StG 77 A2 Kommando is the designation given by the Austrian Special Forces (Jagdkommando) for the Steyr AUG A3 SF when it was adopted in late 2007.
*The StG 77 KPE is the Austrian Army&#x27;s designation for an upgraded StG 77. Where the A1 housing group was replaced with the A3 SF housing and was adopted in 2017.
*The StG 77 A1 MP is the Austrian Military Police&#x27;s designation for the StG 77. The rifles differ from the StG 77 by having a Picatinny rail for an Aimpoint Micro T1 and red dot magnifier, a flash hider from Ase-Utra, and Rheinmetall Vario Ray laser and light module mounted on the right side. Adopted in 2018.
*The StG 77 A1 MOD is the Austrian Army&#x27;s designation of a further modified StG 77. A total of 14,400 rifles will be issued to both the militia and cadre presence units.

===Australian adopted variants===
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) adopted a modified Steyr AUG designated as the F88 Austeyr. From the late 1980s, the F88 became the ADF&#x27;s standard individual weapon replacing the L1A1 SLR and M16A1 in the Australian Army. From the mid-2010s, the Enhanced F88 (EF88) Austeyr replaced the F88.

==== F88 Austeyr ====


In 1985, the ADF ordered 67,000 F88 Austeyrs that were manufactured by Australian Defence Industries (now Thales Australia) at their Lithgow Small Arms Factory under licence from Steyr Mannlicher AG.

*The F88 Austeyr was the standard-issue rifle that had a barrel length of .
*The F88C Austeyr was the carbine variant of the F88 Austeyr that featured a shorter barrel and was without a bayonet lug. The F88C was issued to armoured, helicopter and parachute units.
*The F88T Austeyr is a .22 Long Rifle training rifle that entered service in 1999. The F88T was issued to infantry units, training units and to the Australian Army Cadets.
*The F88S (Special) Austeyr was a variant of the F88 Austeyr that entered service in 1993 with an Accuracy International Mounting System (AIMS) to allow the attachment of a different sighting device.
*The F88SA1 Austeyr was an upgrade of the F88 Austeyr that entered service in 2003. The F88SA1 had an integrated Picatinny rail in place of the standard optical sight. The rail enabled the fitting of the Elcan Wildcat sight, an AN/PVS-4 night vision sight and a night aiming device. The F88S was withdrawn from service.
*The F88SA1C Austeyr was the carbine variant of the F88SA1 Austeyr that had a barrel length of .
*The F88SA2 Austeyr was an upgrade of the F88 Austeyr that entered service in 2009, issued to units serving in the war in Afghanistan. It was withdrawn due to issues and re-entered service in the end of 2010. The rifle had a two-tone colour with a &quot;dark khaki undercarriage and a light brown upper&quot; to match the Disruptive Pattern Desert Uniform. Design improvements included a modified gas system for increased reliability, an enlarged ejection port, a longer Picatinny Rail on top of the weapon, a modified sight housing and a side rail mount for a torch and Night Aiming Device (NAD). The F1A1 ammunition was improved to suit the F88SA2. The rifle could be fitted with a standard 1.5x sight or the Trijicon Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG).

F88 Austeyrs that were fitted with the M203 grenade launcher from the M16A1 had a barrel length of . In 2001, the Grenade Launcher Attachment (GLA) replaced the M203 from the M16A1 and also the M79 grenade launcher. The ADF ordered 3167 GLAs. The GLA featured an Inter-bar (armourer attached) interface, a RM Equipment M203PI grenade launcher, and a Knight&#x27;s Armament quadrant sight assembly to which a Firepoint red dot sight was attached. The bayonet lug and forward vertical grip were removed to fit the Inter-bar.

The Advanced Individual Combat Weapon (AICW) developed by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Tenix Defence Systems, ADI, NICO and Metal Storm was an experimental F88 Austeyr that incorporated a top barrel for Metal Storm 30 mm rounds.

==== EF88 Austeyr ====

The EF88 (Enhanced F88) was developed by Thales Australia for the Australian Defence Force under Project LAND 125 Phase 3C to replace the F88 Austeyr. Thales Australia offers an export version of the EF88 the F90.

The EF88 is produced at Thales Australia&#x27;s Lithgow Arms factory. The contract to develop an improved lighter version of the F88 Austeyr was signed with Thales Australia in December 2011. In September 2014, Thales Australia was awarded a low rate initial production contract after achieving provisional design acceptance. In June 2015, EF88s from the low rate initial production were issued to the Army infantry battalion 1 RAR to trial before the anticipated rollout of the EF88 in 2016. In July 2015, the ADF placed an initial order of 30,000 rifles in two versions a standard rifle with a barrel and a carbine with a barrel.

In July 2020, a second order was placed for an additional 8,500 rifles. Internally and externally the EF88 is still similar to the Steyr AUG, although it has received many distinctive upgrades and changes. The colour that was chosen was a black-finish compared to the two-tone colour with a &quot;dark khaki undercarriage and a light brown upper&quot; finish of the F88A2s.

Upgrades include the following:

* Longer NATO STANAG top rail with a NATO STANAG bottom rail and side rail
* A fixed lighter fluted barrel
* Folding cocking handle
* Extended ejection port with recessed covers
* Enhanced buttstock profile and improved cheek weld design
* Bolt-release catch on buttstock for faster magazine changes
* Elcan Spectre DR 1-4x enhanced day sight

Thales tested two grenade launchers for the EF88 the Madritsch ML40AUS designed specifically for the EF88 and the Steyr SL40. In January 2014, Thales selected the Steyr SL40 for the EF88 reportedly the ML40AUS had &quot;significant&quot; engineering concerns. The ADF ordered 2,277 SL40s. The SL40 is mounted on the rifle&#x27;s bottom accessory rail and its trigger protrudes inside the rifle&#x27;s trigger guard, and uses a Trijicon holographic sight for its sighting system. The SL40 is a derivative of the Steyr GL40 grenade launcher and weighs and has a long barrel. The SL40 does not require a tool to attach it or remove it from the rifle.

Within the Australian Defence Force, there has been some discussion about the suitability of the EF88 when compared against variants of the AR-15 platform such as the M4 carbine and SIG MCX.

In November 2021, &quot;Defence Technology Review&quot; reported that Thales Australia, in collaboration with the Australian Army, were developing a next-generation individual weapon in bullpup configuration chambered for the 6.8 mm calibre.

==== F90 ====
In June 2012, Thales debuted the F90 at the Eurosatory military exhibition in Paris. Lithgow Arms offers the F90 in three different barrel lengths: , , and . The barrels are fixed cold hammer forged, chrome lined and fluted. The rifle has heat-vent cut outs for better heat ventilation. The rifle can also be fitted with the SL40 grenade launcher. Its nominal cyclic rate of fire is 740 rounds per minute.

In 2017, Dasan Manufacturing was granted the rights to manufacture the F90, in an effort to bid them to the South Korean military for future replacements of the Daewoo K2. It is marketed by Dasan as the DSR-90.

At the Defexpo 2018 convention, MKU gained Indian licensing rights to manufacture the F90 for Indian contracts. In April 2019, the F90CQB variant was planned to be submitted in conjunction with the Kalyani Group for Indian Army requirements on a 5.56 mm NATO carbine. As of April 2020, Bharat Forge is Thales&#x27; partner to manufacture the F90. BF will market it to Indian military and law enforcement, and for potential export sales.

In 2016, &quot;The Firearm Blog&quot; reported that a semi-automatic variant of the F90 the Atrax would be available to the US civilian market. In 2018, &quot;The Firearm Blog&quot; reported that Dasan USA had commenced producing components for the Atrax. In 2019, &quot;The Firearm Blog&quot; reported that Thales had cancelled the rifle for &quot;ethical reasons.&quot;

In March 2018, Thales Australia introduced the F90MBR (Modular Bullpup Rifle). It is a successor to the F90, which features STANAG magazine compatibility.

=== Irish adopted variants ===
The Steyr AUG 1 entered service with the Irish Defence Forces in 1988.

In 2014, the Irish Army began a modernisation programme to upgrade their Steyr AUG A1s, which was possible due to the modularity of the AUG. The result was the Steyr AUG Mod 14, and on the same year the army began issuing the rifle to its operational units.

They replaced the original A1 housing/receiver group (with 1.5× optical sight) with an A3 housing/receiver group (with a Picatinny rail on top and right side) allowing a modern optical sight to be fitted. The Trijicon ACOG 4× sight was selected as the new optical sight of the rifle. The rifle features the ALO &quot;automatic lockout&quot; trigger, which can also be found in the Australian and New Zealand variants.

=== New Zealand adopted variants ===
The New Zealand Defence Force adopted the AUG A1 model, designated &quot;Individual Weapon, Steyr&quot; (IW Steyr) as its primary individual weapon. 5,000 Austrian made rifles entered service in 1988, later supplemented by a further 15,000 manufactured in Australia by ADI. In 2013, &quot;Stuff&quot; reported that New Zealand had 13,000 IW Steyrs. In 2015, New Zealand selected the Lewis Machine and Tool Mars-L 5.56mm rifle to replace the IW Steyr and began transitioning to the new rifle in 2017.

The variants of the New Zealand IW Steyr were equipped with a progressive trigger (without full-auto lock-out tab as seen on F88 models) and a three-position safety. The sight added a crosshair to the circle reticule. New Zealand issued both factory and locally modified carbines alongside the full-length rifle variant.

=== Civilian variants ===

* The Steyr AUG P is a semi-automatic only variant of the AUG A1 available to the civilian and law enforcement markets. It features the carbine length, barrel and a modified bolt, carrier and trigger assembly that will only allow semi-automatic fire. The rifle also has a slightly different optical sight that features a reticule with a fine dot in the centre of the aiming circle, allowing for more precise aiming.
*The Steyr AUG P Special Receiver is similar to the AUG P but features a STANAG scope mount system on top of the receiver.
*The Steyr AUG SA is a semi-automatic only variant of the AUG A1, built for civilian use and import to the US before being banned from importation in 1989.
*The Steyr AUG Z is a semi-automatic only variant in compliance with Austrian weapon laws, somewhat similar to the AUG A2 but lacking the quick detachable barrels and is unable to accept the trigger group from the assault rifles. It is intended primarily for civilian use.
*The Steyr AUG Z Sport is a semi-automatic only variant, somewhat similar to the AUG Z, for use in sport shooting approved by the BKA in Germany. This variant has a special handguard without the typical front grip.

*The Steyr USR is an AUG A2 modified to meet the former Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB) (or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act) regulations. The USR has a thumb hole stock molded in gray polymer. The barrel is made by GSI Inc and is a 20” bull barrel. No threads so no muzzle device. The barrel takedown button has been cut off. 
*The Steyr AUG A3 SA USA is a semi-automatic only variant of the AUG A3 with a barrel, made available for the U.S. civilian market in April 2009.
*The Steyr AUG A3 SA NATO: is a semi-automatic only variant similar to the AUG A3 SA USA, but uses a right-hand-only, NATO STANAG magazine stock assembly.

It reverted to the A1 style charging handle with a push-button forward assist and an added slot to lock it in the forward position. It was designed to accommodate an M-LOK handguard manufactured by Steyr. It has been manufactured in the US by Steyr Arms US since April 2024.

===AUG clones===
* The STG-556 was introduced at the 2007 SHOT Show, it was manufactured by Microtech Small Arms Research Inc. (a subsidiary of Microtech Knives) an AUG A1 clone significantly re-engineered in its working system and principle as it features a bolt hold-open device as seen on the M16 rifle; otherwise the MSAR STG-556 retains the original AUG features, such as feeding from proprietary translucent plastic magazines and having the quick-change barrel option. The STG-556 can be converted from either having a telescopic sight or a Picatinny rail. It is available in either civilian (semi-automatic only) configuration, and military and law enforcement (selective fire) configuration.
* The AXR was revealed at the 2007 SHOT Show, manufactured by Tactical Products Design Inc. as an AUG A2 clone capab le of semi-automatic only fire, aimed for both the civilian and law enforcement markets, and fed by STANAG magazines; the manufacturer sells clear plastic magazines which are STANAG 4179 compliant and will readily fit in any rifle with a compatible magazine catch. The rifle does not have the integral scope, allowing users to use any kind of scopes or laser sights on the Picatinny rail.
* The Oberland Arms OA-UG is a German clone of the AUG intended for use in Germany in civilian sales.
* The Type 68 is a Taiwanese copy of the AUG with notable differences including a smaller trigger guard and the use of iron sights instead of the original&#x27;s telescopic sight (although optical sights can still be optionally mounted on the carrying handle). Developed as a potential alternative to the T65 assault rifle and (in the form of a heavy-barrel variant) replacement to the Type 57A assault rifle, it ultimately did not enter service after the ROC military decided to adopt the Minimi and T75 as their future light machine gun.

<text>Keira Christina Knightley OBE ( ; born 26 March 1985) is an English actress. Known for her work in independent films and blockbusters, particularly period dramas, she has received numerous accolades, including nominations for two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, four Golden Globes, and a Laurence Olivier Award. In 2018, she was appointed an OBE at Buckingham Palace for services to drama and charity.

Born in London to actors Will Knightley and Sharman Macdonald, Knightley obtained an agent at age six and initially worked in commercials and television films. Following a minor role as Sabé in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), her breakthrough came when she played a tomboy footballer in &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; (2002) and co-starred in &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003). She achieved global recognition for playing Elizabeth Swann in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series (2003–2007).

For her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet in &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), Knightley was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She starred in several more period films over the next few years, including &quot;Atonement&quot; (2007), &quot;The Duchess&quot; (2008), &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011), and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; (2012). She took on contemporary-set parts in &quot;Begin Again&quot; (2013) and &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; (2014), and returned to historical films playing Joan Clarke in &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014), earning a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has since starred as the title character in &quot;Colette&quot; (2018), journalist Loretta McLaughlin in &quot;Boston Strangler&quot; (2023), and a spy in the thriller series &quot;Black Doves&quot; (2024).

On stage, Knightley has appeared in two West End productions: &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; in 2009, which earned her an Olivier Award nomination, and &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; in 2011. She also starred as the titular heroine in the 2015 Broadway production of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;. Knightley is known for her outspoken stance on social issues and has worked extensively with Amnesty International, Oxfam, and Comic Relief. She is married to musician James Righton, with whom she has two daughters.

== Early life and education ==
Keira Christina Knightley was born on 26 March 1985 in the London suburb of Teddington, to stage actors Will Knightley and Sharman Macdonald. She was meant to be named &quot;Kiera&quot;, the anglicised form of &quot;Kira&quot;, after the Soviet figure skater Kira Ivanova, whom her father admired; however, Macdonald misspelt the name when she registered her daughter&#x27;s birth certificate, writing the &quot;e&quot; before the &quot;i&quot;. Her father is English and her mother is of Scottish and Welsh descent. Knightley has an older brother, Caleb. Macdonald worked as a playwright after her acting career came to an end. Knightley&#x27;s parents encountered substantial financial difficulties following the birth of her brother; her father, a &quot;middling&quot; actor, agreed to a second child only if her mother sold a script first. However, her parents&#x27; varying degrees of success did not deter Knightley&#x27;s curiosity about the profession. Macdonald introduced her own children to theatre and ballet very early. This inspired Knightley&#x27;s interest in acting.

Knightley attended Teddington School. She was diagnosed with dyslexia at age six, but by the time she was eleven, with her parents&#x27; support, she says, &quot;they deemed me to have got over it sufficiently&quot;. She is still a slow reader and cannot read out loud. Knightley has said she was &quot;single-minded about acting&quot;. At age three, she requested to obtain an agent like her parents and secured one at six. This led to her taking a number of small parts in television dramas. She acted in a number of local amateur productions, which included &quot;After Juliet&quot;, written by her mother, and &quot;United States&quot;, written by her drama teacher. Knightley began studying her A-Levels at Esher College, but left after a year to pursue an acting career. Her mother&#x27;s friends encouraged her to go to drama school, which she declined for financial and professional reasons.

== Career ==
=== 1993–2002: Career beginnings and breakthrough ===
After obtaining an agent at age six, Knightley began working in commercials and small television roles. Her first onscreen appearance was in the 1993 &quot;Screen One&quot; television episode titled &quot;Royal Celebration&quot;. She then played Natasha Jordan, a young girl whose mother is involved in an extramarital affair, in the romantic drama &quot;A Village Affair&quot; (1995). After appearing in a spate of television films through the mid-to-late 1990s, including &quot;Innocent Lies&quot; (1995), &quot;The Treasure Seekers&quot; (1996), &quot;Coming Home&quot; (1998), and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1999), Knightley landed the role of Sabé, Padmé Amidala&#x27;s handmaiden and decoy, in the 1999 science fiction blockbuster &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. Her dialogue was dubbed over by Natalie Portman, who played Padmé. Knightley was cast in the role because of her close resemblance to Portman; even the two actresses&#x27; mothers had difficulty telling their daughters apart when they were in full make-up.

In her first major role, the 2001 Walt Disney Productions television film &quot;Princess of Thieves&quot;, Knightley played the daughter of Robin Hood. In preparation for the part, she trained for several weeks in archery, fencing, and riding. Concurrently, she appeared in &quot;The Hole&quot;, a thriller that received a direct-to-video release in the US. The film&#x27;s director Nick Hamm described her as &quot;a young version of Julie Christie&quot;. Knightley also took on the role of Lara Antipova in the 2002 miniseries adaptation of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, to positive reviews and high ratings. In the same year, Knightley starred as a pregnant drug addict in Gillies MacKinnon&#x27;s drama film &quot;Pure&quot;. Co-starring Molly Parker and Harry Eden, the film had its world premiere at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In a retrospect review for AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna noted Knightley&#x27;s screen presence and wrote that &quot;[although Knightley] doesn&#x27;t have half of Parker&#x27;s ability [...] she has spunk and grit [and] shines brightly in &quot;Pure&quot;&quot;.

Knightley landed a breakthrough role when she starred in Gurinder Chadha&#x27;s sports comedy film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, which was a box office hit in the U.K and U.S. Knightley portrayed Jules, a tomboy football player struggling against social norms who convinces her friend to pursue the sport. The film surprised critics who were laudatory of its &quot;charming&quot; and &quot;inspiring&quot; nature, social context and the cast&#x27;s performances. Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra attracted international attention for their performances; critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the &quot;energetic and likable&quot; cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought &quot;a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters&quot;. To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley was initially sceptical of the project: in an interview with Tracy Smith she said, &quot;I remember telling friends I was doing this girls&#x27; soccer movie [...] And nobody thought that it was gonna be any good.&quot;

=== 2003–2007: &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; and worldwide recognition ===
Knightley was cast as Elizabeth Swann in the 2003 American fantasy swashbuckler film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. The film, based on the Disney theme park attraction, revolves around infamous buccaneer Jack Sparrow and blacksmith Will Turner rescuing Swann, in possession of a cursed golden medallion, from 18th-century pirates. The producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski cast Knightley for her &quot;indescribable quality [...] reminiscent of motion picture stars from Hollywood&#x27;s heyday.&quot; Knightley underestimated the stunt work required and believed she would primarily be sitting in carriages; at one point during filming, she stood for two days on a plank and rejected a stunt double&#x27;s offer to jump off the platform for the scene. Despite boasting the names of stars like Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and a $135 million budget, &quot;Pirates&quot; was expected to fail at the box office. Knightley herself was not optimistic about its prospects. The film opened at number one on the box office, and became one of the highest-grossing releases of the year, with worldwide revenues of $654 million. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; likened Knightley&#x27;s &quot;strident and confident&quot; physical assurance to that of Nicole Kidman, while Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described her and Bloom as appealing leads.

Also in 2003, Knightley appeared in Richard Curtis&#x27;s Christmas-themed romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot;, featuring an ensemble cast, which included her childhood idol Emma Thompson. Knightley played Juliet, a woman whose fiancée&#x27;s best man is secretly in love with her. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticised the waste of Knightley&#x27;s talent in a &quot;nothing&quot; role, while Megan Conner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that the film turned Knightley into a household name. &quot;Love Actually&quot; has been referred to as a modern-day Christmas classic. Knightley believes the film&#x27;s trajectory to be &quot;extraordinary&quot;, given that its popularity resurfaced a few years after the film&#x27;s release. Knightley&#x27;s only release of 2004 was the historical film &quot;King Arthur&quot;, where she played Guinevere, a warrior queen and the wife of the titular character. The part required her to learn boxing, archery, and riding. The critic A. O. Scott praised Knightley for &quot;throw[ing] herself bodily into every scene&quot;. Although the film received unfavourable reviews, Knightley&#x27;s stature as a performer grew; she was voted by the readers of &quot;Hello&quot; magazine as the industry&#x27;s most promising teen star, and featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s article, which stated that she seemed dedicated to develop herself as a serious actor rather than a film star.

Knightley appeared in three films in 2005, the first of which was the psychological thriller &quot;The Jacket&quot;, co-starring Adrien Brody. In a mixed review for &quot;Empire&quot;, Kim Newman wrote that the role was unlike the ones she had previously taken up : &quot;getting out of period gear and talking American, tries to broaden her range and is arguably well-cast&quot;. Knightley next played the titular character in Tony Scott&#x27;s French-American action film &quot;Domino&quot;, based on the life of Domino Harvey. The film&#x27;s release was delayed on several occasions and, on its eventual release in November, it received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office.

Knightley&#x27;s most successful release of the year was &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;, a period drama based on Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The director Joe Wright cast Knightley for her tomboyish nature combined with a &quot;lively mind&quot; and sense of humour. Knightley, who had admired the book from a young age, said of her character, &quot;The beauty of Elizabeth is that every woman who ever reads the book seems to recognise herself, with all her faults and imperfections.&quot; On release, the film became a huge commercial success, with total collections of around US$120million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw labelled her performance of &quot;beauty, delicacy, spirit and wit; in her growing lustre and confidence&quot; and Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; found her &quot;luminous strength&quot; to be reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn. Knightley earned &quot;Best Actress in a Leading Role&quot; nominations at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards for her performance at age 20, becoming the third-youngest nominee for the latter. Knightley&#x27;s consecutive successes came with increased media scrutiny, and she later admitted to experiencing struggles with her mental health during this period.

Knightley was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among other artists in 2006. In 2004, the second and third films of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series were conceived, with screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio developing a story arc that would span both sequels, in which Knightley reprised her role as Elizabeth Swann. The plot of the films see Swann buck convention to seek adventure and become fierce pirate and fighter to match the skills of Sparrow and her love interest, Turner. The sequel installments allowed Knightley to study sword-fighting, which she had sought to do since the first film. Filming for the projects took place in 2005; &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; released in July 2006, with the worldwide collections of $1.066 billion, becoming the biggest financial hit of Knightley&#x27;s career. The third installment in the series, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, was released in May, the following year. A. O Scott termed her performance &quot;a vision of imperial British pluckiness, with an intriguing dash of romantic recklessness that surfaces toward the end&quot;. In November 2006, it was reported that Knightley didn&#x27;t want to participate in any further sequels. By 2010, both Knightley and Orlando Bloom had repeatedly been quoted in saying they wanted to move on.

Knightley&#x27;s continued association with period dramas yielded varying results, as seen with two of her 2007 releases, François Girard&#x27;s &quot;Silk&quot;, and Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot;, the feature film adaptations of the novels by Alessandro Baricco and Ian McEwan respectively. The former project failed at the box office, while the latter became a critical and commercial success. Knightley played Cecilia Tallis, the elder of the two Tallis sisters, who struggles with a wartime romance with her love interest, played by James McAvoy. She admitted that the pacing on the smaller, more intimate film was an adjustment compared to the &quot;Pirates&quot; franchise. In preparing for the film, Knightley studied the novel as well as the &quot;naturalism&quot; of the performance as seen in films from the 1930s and 1940s, such as &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942) and &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; (1945). She admired the multi-layered and &quot;fascinating&quot; nature of her character&#x27;s behaviour. Knightley&#x27;s performance won the Empire Award for Best Actress, and earned her nominations for the BAFTA and the Golden Globes awards, also in the leading actress categories. The critic Richard Roeper, who thought the lead duo were &quot;superb&quot; in their respective roles, was puzzled by their failure to receive Academy Award nominations. The green dress worn by Knightley during the film&#x27;s climactic scene garnered substantive press attention, and was subsequently regarded as one of the greatest costumes in film history.

=== 2008–2013: Independent films and stage work ===
Knightley appeared alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy, and Matthew Rhys in John Maybury&#x27;s 2008 wartime drama &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;. The film had her play the role of Vera Phillips, a childhood friend of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas and his wife Caitlin Macnamara. Knightley wrote the script with her mother, Sharman Macdonald, with Macnamara in mind. After Knightley signed on, her character&#x27;s role was increased with the film focusing on her romance with a British soldier. Knightley connected to Vera&#x27;s quietness, and described her as &quot;tragic and beautiful&quot;. She based her performance on Marlene Dietrich, and was to mime to her prerecorded voice, before being told by Maybury to sing live. Knightley initially felt embarrassed to do so, saying she &quot;[shook] like a leaf&quot; but eventually went through with the plan. Upon release, the film became a moderate critical and commercial success. Knightley&#x27;s performance and singing abilities were praised;&quot;The Independent&quot; noted that Knightley &quot;gives Vera an independence and complexity that&#x27;s aeons ahead&quot;, while the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote &quot;the film belongs to the women, with Knightley going from strength to strength (and showing she can sing!)&quot;.

Knightley then starred as the 18th-century English aristocrat Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire in Saul Dibb&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Duchess&quot; (2008), based on the best-selling biographical novel, &quot;Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire&quot; by Amanda Foreman. The film tells the story of Georgiana&#x27;s rise in society as a sociopolitical tastemaker after her marriage disintegrates. The script Knightley was sent was covered in &quot;huge white ostrich feathers&quot; and a gold ribbon. Gabrielle Tana, the film&#x27;s producer, stated Knightley &quot;brought an instinctive understanding&quot; of such aspects of Georgiana&#x27;s life as a celebrity from her own experiences. Knightley was attracted to her character&#x27;s strength and status as a political influence and fashion prowess, while being inwardly vulnerable and isolated. Simon Crooke of &quot;Empire&quot; described her performance as &quot;an enigmatic, free-spirited turn and a role she&#x27;ll be remembered for, probably her best role to date in a film not directed by Joe Wright.&quot; The following year, she was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress. A film adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;King Lear&quot; set to star Knightley and Anthony Hopkins was cancelled due to recession.

Knightley made her West End debut with Martin Crimp&#x27;s version of Molière&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. Starring Knightley, Damian Lewis, Tara Fitzgerald, and Dominic Rowan, the play was staged at the Comedy Theatre in December 2009. She portrayed Jennifer, a shallow, amorous, and vulnerable American film star who is courted by an analytical and veracious playwright. Knightley chose the role as she felt that &quot;if I don&#x27;t do theatre right now, I think I&#x27;m going to start being too terrified to do it&quot; and described the production as an &quot;extraordinary and incredibly fulfilling&quot; experience, she was sceptical of her performance. Paul Taylor of &quot;The Independent&quot; remarked that Knightley was &quot;not only strikingly convincing, but, at times, rather thrilling in its satiric aplomb&quot;. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Michael Billington noted that due to the nature of the role, &quot;one could say that she is not unduly stretched&quot;. In recognition of her theatre debut, Knightley was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award.

Knightley began the new decade with three films; she remarked that her work during this period helped her &quot;empathise with people or with situations that I don&#x27;t necessarily find it easy to empathise with&quot;. Two of the productions, Massy Tadjedin&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Last Night&quot; and William Monahan&#x27;s crime noir film &quot;London Boulevard&quot; opened to mixed responses from critics and rank among the lowest-grossing films in Knightley&#x27;s career. Knightley&#x27;s other release, &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;, an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s novel of the same name fared better at the box office and received positive reviews. Knightley described the script as unique, one that made the reader think. Co-starring Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan, Knightley played Ruth, one of three graduates of an autocratic boarding school that discovers their fates in a dystopia. She appeared in a video installation by artist Stuart Pearson Wright titled &quot;Maze&quot;.

Knightley starred in a 2011 revival of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; by Lillian Hellman at the Comedy Theatre in London. She portrayed Karen Wright, an engaged schoolteacher accused of lesbianism in 1934. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that her performance showed an &quot;intensity&quot; and &quot;credible fierceness&quot; within the outdated material. Knightley&#x27;s sole film release of 2011 was David Cronenberg&#x27;s historical drama &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;, co-starring Viggo Mortensen, Michael Fassbender, and Vincent Cassel. Based on writer Christopher Hampton&#x27;s 2002 stage play &quot;The Talking Cure&quot; and set on the eve of World War I, the film depicts the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung, his mentor Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein. Knightley portrayed Spielrein, the troubled but beautiful young psychoanalyst who comes between Jung and Freud. Knightley spent four months reading and discussing her character&#x27;s behaviour with psychologists to prepare for the role. She appreciated the depth and variety of her character arc, which she viewed as rare for female roles. The film premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival to a positive reception, while Knightley earned generally favourable reviews by critics, with Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; hailing her as &quot;the real star of this film&quot;.

Knightley co-starred with Steve Carell in the 2012 comedy-drama &quot;Seeking a Friend for the End of the World&quot;, which was critically panned. Later that year, she reunited with director Joe Wright to film their third production, &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, in which she starred as the title character. She deemed this collaboration the most important of her career. Knightley viewed that her character&#x27;s complex &quot;moral culpability&quot; was in question, but attracted compassion. Knightley received positive reviews for her performance, prompting early Oscar buzz. Batsy Sharky of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Knightley &quot;puts hearts and anguish on the line in trying to bring an emotional reality&quot;. The 2013 Toronto International Film Festival saw the premiere of Knightley&#x27;s first musical film &quot;Begin Again&quot; with Mark Ruffalo. Directed by John Carney, the film had its theatrical release in 2014. &quot;The Guardian&quot; found Knightley and Ruffalo to be &quot;nicely natural as the increasingly idealistic musos&quot;. Carney later repeatedly criticised Knightley&#x27;s performance in the film, saying she was not convincing enough in portraying a singer-songwriter and derogatorily referred to her as a &quot;model&quot;. He later apologised to her via Twitter for his comments. Knightley later remarked that music &quot;never sinks in&quot; for her, and she is more interested in books and drama. Later that year, she appeared in Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s short period film &quot;Once Upon a Time...&quot;

=== 2014–present: Biographical and political roles ===
In July 2014, Knightley stated that she had reached the end of the first stage of her career, and wished to depart from &quot;neurotic&quot; roles. 2014 began for Knightley with the spy thriller &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot;, the fifth instalment in the film series, alongside Chris Pine. She portrayed Dr. Cathy Muller, Ryan&#x27;s eventual wife. Knightley sought to do a lighter film than her previous work, looked forward to working with director Kenneth Branagh. The film received mixed critical reviews nonetheless strong box-office response. Knightley&#x27;s next film &quot;Laggies&quot;, premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. A romantic comedy also starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Sam Rockwell, the film follows the life of Megan, played by Knightley, a 28-year-old overeducated underachiever going through a quarter-life crisis. Knightley empathised with her character&#x27;s delayed maturity and appreciated the film&#x27;s telling from a female perspective. &quot;Laggies&quot; opened to mostly positive reviews from critics, with Knightley&#x27;s performance praised by critics. Inkoo Kaang of &quot;TheWrap&quot; referred to her as a &quot;loose-limbed revelation&quot; and lauded her &quot;delightfully uncouth&quot; performance.

The film was followed by her appearance in Morten Tyldum&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;, a film based on the life of British mathematician Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Knightley portrayed cryptanalyst and numismatist Joan Clarke, who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during World War II with Turing. Knightley researched interviews with Clarke, and sought to keep her &quot;upper-class quality&quot;, drawing on the depth of her emotions and protectiveness of Turing from the script. &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; became a critical and commercial success grossing over $233.6 million. For her performance, Knightley received her second Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations, and third Golden Globe Award nomination, all for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Conversely, Lady Jean Forde, who worked with Clarke and Turing, felt Knightley was &quot;nothing like&quot; Clarke and was &quot;too beautiful&quot; to play her.

Knightley&#x27;s sole release in 2015 was as part of the ensemble cast in the biographical disaster film &quot;Everest&quot;. The film was based on the 1996 Mount Everest disaster with Knightley portraying mountaineer Rob Hall&#x27;s wife. &quot;Everest&quot; opened to generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that Knightley gave a &quot;deeply felt performance&quot; as a woman &quot;haunted by the possibility&quot; of losing her spouse. In October 2015, Knightley made her Broadway debut playing the title role in Helen Edmundson&#x27;s adaptation of Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; at Studio 54. Knightley took the role after turning down the project twice, as she thought herself incapable of playing the part. She found interest in her character&#x27;s &quot;caged&quot; circumstance, as well as her dark, active role in the play, as she sought to depart from passive supporting roles. Of her performance, Alexandra Villarreal of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;She fumes, and rages, and withdraws, and you can watch her psychological evolution from stifled wife to impassioned mistress to haunted murderer&quot;.

In 2016, it emerged that Knightley was set to star in a feature biopic about 18th-century Russian empress Catherine the Great, directed by Barbra Streisand, which has not come to fruition. Knightley appeared in the ensemble drama &quot;Collateral Beauty&quot; (2016), alongside Will Smith, Edward Norton, Kate Winslet, and Helen Mirren. The film was critically panned, and earned the cast a Razzie nomination. Despite previously stating on a number of occasions that she would never return to the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series since 2006, Knightley reprised the role of Elizabeth Swann with a cameo appearance in 2017&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, after test audiences repeatedly inquired about her character.

Knightley starred in the biographical drama &quot;Colette&quot; as the titular French author. The film sees Colette&#x27;s social ascent in belle époque society through her provocative novels, but she is exploited by her husband, who plagiarises her work. Knightley believed the film connected strongly to modern-day feminism, and depicted cultural change in gender politics. To prepare for the part, Knightley read Colette&#x27;s novels, among them &quot;The Vagabond&quot; and &quot;Chéri&quot;, and initially planned to visit her birthplace of Burgundy, France. She found the author &quot;inspiring&quot;, and admired her imperfections as well as her courage. The film, released at the Sundance Film Festival, was critically successful, with Knightley&#x27;s performance receiving acclaim. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her vibrance and &quot;expressive physicality&quot;, and Jordan Hoffman of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film saw Knightley in &quot;top form: luminous, clever, sexy and sympathetic.&quot; Knightley was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to drama and charity.

The same year, she played the Sugar Plum Fairy in Disney&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, titled &quot;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&quot;, which was critically panned. In 2019, Knightley co-starred in &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, a film adaptation of the novel by Rhidian Brook, alongside Alexander Skarsgård. Knightley played Rachel, a &quot;cold and complex&quot; British army wife traumatised by her son&#x27;s death by a German bomb. The film sees her and her husband move to Germany while dealing with grief. The film received mixed reviews. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Ty Burr credited Knightley for adding &quot;conviction, grace, heart, and nerve&quot; to the film, while Katie Walsh of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt Knightley and Skarsgård were too reserved. Knightley portrayed whistleblower Katharine Gun in &quot;Official Secrets&quot; (2019), which was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019 to positive reviews. Knightley believed the film&#x27;s depiction of Iraq War and government accountability connected with modern politics. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw praised Knightley&#x27;s &quot;focused, plausible and sympathetic performance&quot;. Gun also expressed her contentment with the film.

Knightley&#x27;s first role of the decade was feminist activist Sally Alexander in &quot;Misbehaviour&quot; (2020), a film about the crowning of the first black contestant at the 1970 Miss World competition. The film discusses the nuances of intersectionality in second wave feminism; Knightley was drawn to the political aspects of the project. &quot;Misbehaviour&quot; was received positively, with &quot;Variety&quot;″s Guy Lodge dubbing Knightley &quot;likable as ever&quot; but admitted she portrays &quot;the least intriguing figure&quot;. Knightley was due to produce and star in &quot;The Essex Serpent&quot;, an Apple TV+ adaptation of Sarah Perry&#x27;s novel, but dropped out over concerns about access to childcare during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. She starred in the 2021 holiday comedy &quot;Silent Night&quot;. Knightley voiced the lead role in the dramatic animated film &quot;Charlotte&quot;, a true story about a young artist during the Holocaust.

Knightley took a year off work to spend time with family. In 2023, she portrayed reporter Loretta McLaughlin in the crime drama film &quot;Boston Strangler&quot; based on the infamous true story of Boston Strangler murders. In the following year, she starred as a spy in the Netflix thriller series &quot;Black Doves&quot;. For her performance, she was nominated for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama.

== Public image ==
Off-screen, Geoffrey Macnab of &quot;The Independent&quot; describes Knightley as &quot;sensible and self-deprecating&quot; and Elizabeth Day of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; says of Knightley&#x27;s persona: &quot;She is extremely nice, swears more than you might think and – yes – ... effortlessly beautiful&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jesse McKinley stated that Knightley is &quot;known for her ability to sparkle and charm in several accents&quot;, while her &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; co-star, Judith Light, praised her &quot;down-to-earth demeanor, intelligence and sense of humor&quot;.

Knightley has been described as &quot;famously open with media&quot;, though she has asserted the contrary. During the 2000s, Knightley faced an &quot;extraordinary amount of vitriol&quot; from the press. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;if she is not too pretty to be worthy of her success, she is too posh, too thin. If there is a more valid reason why [...] they often struggle to articulate it.&quot; Despite multiple successful films and award nominations, the criticism affected her, and Knightley felt that she &quot;didn&#x27;t know [her] trade&quot;. Media scrutiny decreased as her career progressed, and she spaces out her public appearances to maintain attention on her films. Beginning in the 2010s, Knightley regained confidence in her abilities, and by the release of &quot;Colette&quot; (2018), she felt she had learned her craft and mentally occupied a &quot;good place where I feel pretty confident about what I can do&quot;.

Several publications have described Knightley as one of the finest actresses of her generation. Knightley has been widely recognised for her extensive repertoire of period dramas throughout her career. She identifies with &quot;break[ing] out of that image of femininity&quot; and appreciates period films&#x27; &quot;overt cage&quot; to demonstrate such. Writer Anne Helen Petersen states that the varying personalities of her historical roles are united in the &quot;larger idea&quot; Knightley represents: &quot;that of women ostensibly performing a version of proper womanhood — all while quietly negotiating, or cracking under, the weight of doing so.&quot; She has criticised contemporary-set films, finding their depiction of sexual violence against women excessive. Knightley is reputed for her signature &quot;strong female lead&quot; roles, and she has been compared to actresses Katharine Hepburn, Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn, and Nicole Kidman.

In a 2004 BBC poll, she was named among the most influential people in British culture. Knightley has often been ascribed to the &quot;English rose&quot; archetype. Knightley has been included several times on &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; list, making her first appearance in 2004 and topping the list in 2006; she was included in every subsequent issue until 2009. She was part of the American editions of the list from 2004 to 2006, and was also placed ninth on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 list in 2006.

== Other ventures ==
=== Advocacy and philanthropy ===
Knightley received media attention for her perspectives on feminism, voiced in an interview with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar UK&quot; published in the February 2014 edition. She explained that women face greater hurdles in the film industry compared to their male counterparts, and also revealed that she was perplexed by the use of &quot;feminist&quot; in a derogatory sense. Knightley posed topless for the September 2014 cover of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, on condition that the image not be digitally altered, to draw attention to how &quot;women&#x27;s bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame.&quot; For International Women&#x27;s Day 2014, Knightley was one of the artist signatories of Amnesty International&#x27;s letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, in which the organisation campaigned for women&#x27;s rights in Afghanistan. After the birth of her first daughter, she penned an essay about childbirth, entitled &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot;, featured in the collection &quot;Feminists Don&#x27;t Wear Pink and Other Lies&quot;. Knightley does not shoot nude scenes for her films, unless directed by a female filmmaker.

Knightley is the face of an Amnesty International campaign to support human rights, marking the sixtieth anniversary of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 2004, she travelled to Ethiopia alongside Richard Curtis, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Julian Metcalfe on behalf of the Comic Relief charity. She posed for photos for WaterAid in 2005 and also for the American Library Association&#x27;s &quot;Read&quot; campaign (a promotional poster of &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;). The dress she wore to the 2006 Academy Awards was donated to the charity Oxfam, where it raised £4,300. In April 2009, Knightley appeared in a video to raise awareness of domestic abuse entitled &quot;Cut&quot; shot for Women&#x27;s Aid. The video created controversy, with some sources calling it too graphic, while other groups support the video for showing a realistic depiction of domestic violence. In November 2010, Knightley became patron of the SMA Trust, a British charity that funds medical research into the disease spinal muscular atrophy. In July 2014 Knightley travelled to South Sudan on behalf of Oxfam to meet refugees of the South Sudanese Civil War and raise awareness of the conflict.

In May 2016, Knightley signed a letter imploring Britain to vote &quot;remain&quot; in the UK EU referendum. The letter was also signed by John le Carré, Benedict Cumberbatch and Danny Boyle among others. Later, she appeared in a video aimed at encouraging younger people to vote in the referendum. On 12 September 2016, Knightley, along with Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Peter Capaldi, Douglas Booth, Neil Gaiman, Jesse Eisenberg, Juliet Stevenson, Kit Harington and Stanley Tucci, appeared in a video from the United Nations&#x27; refugee agency UNHCR to help raise awareness of the global refugee crisis. The video, titled &quot;What They Took With Them&quot;, has the actors reading a poem, written by Jenifer Toksvig and inspired by primary accounts of refugees, and is part of UNHCR&#x27;s #WithRefugees campaign, of which also includes a petition to governments to expand asylum to provide further shelter, integrating job opportunities, and education. In September 2016, Knightley co-hosted A Night to Remember, part of the Green Carpet Challenge, a charity event highlighting sustainability within the fashion industry.

In September 2017, Knightley traded stocks on behalf of the spinal muscular atrophy charity SMA Trust as part of the BGC Charity Day, which was set up to commemorate the stockbrokers who were killed during the September 11 attacks. In April 2020, Knightley participated in a World Health Day livestream to raise money for charity during the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, she and other celebrities designed a range of pin badges for the #PinYourThanks campaign, dedicated to thanking essential workers. All profits went to NHS Charities Together and Volunteering Matters. In October 2020, she backed Made By Dyslexia, a global campaign to help teachers address &quot;dyslexic strengths&quot;. It has trained a quarter of a million teachers and started an online program. Knightley participated in a skit entitled &quot;2020 The Movie&quot;, commemorating Red Nose Day 2021.

=== Fashion endorsements ===
Knightley was the celebrity face for the luxury goods brands Asprey and Shiatzy Chen as well as Lux haircare products in Japanese television commercials. In April 2006, she was confirmed as the new celebrity face of Chanel&#x27;s perfume Coco Mademoiselle, though the first photo from the campaign was not released until May 2007. Knightley has appeared in television commercials for Chanel directed by Joe Wright since 2007, and has endorsed Chanel Fine Jewellery&#x27;s collection Coco Crush. In 2008, Knightley was the highest-earning British Hollywood star according to the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list and was named amongst the most bankable actors in 2009.

== Personal life ==
Knightley dated actors Del Synnott (2001–2003), Jamie Dornan (2003–2005), and Rupert Friend (2005–2010). She began a relationship with musician James Righton in February 2011. They got married on 4 May 2013 in Mazan, France. They have two daughters together, born in 2015 and 2019. The family resides in Canonbury, Islington, London. Knightley advocates equal paternity leave and has spoken about the expense of childcare in England. She remarked in 2016 on &quot;how lucky I&#x27;ve been to be able to afford really good childcare, otherwise it would be at least four years out of my career.&quot; She has no social media profiles in an effort to preserve her family&#x27;s privacy.

Knightley won a libel case against the British tabloid &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in 2007 after it had falsely claimed that she had an eating disorder. Awarded £3,000 in damages, she added to the sum and donated £6,000 to Beat, a charity for those with mental illness and eating disorders.

In February 2010, a 41-year-old man was charged with harassment after trying to contact Knightley on several occasions outside London&#x27;s Comedy Theatre, where she was performing in &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. The subsequent trial folded after she was unavailable to testify in court. Another man was sentenced to eight weeks in prison after harassing Knightley outside her home and stalking her in December 2016.

Knightley took a break from working in 2006, suggesting that she wanted to take some time off acting to travel and focus on her personal life. In 2018, Knightley revealed that she had a mental breakdown at age 22 and had been later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), since she struggled to adjust to her sudden rise to stardom. She recounted how she did not leave her home for three months up until early 2008, and needed to have hypnotherapy to prevent panic attacks so she could be able to attend that year&#x27;s BAFTA Awards, where she was nominated for her performance in &quot;Atonement&quot;.

She is an atheist.

<doc id="249901" wikidata="Q1593109" url="?curid=249901" title="Hector-Louis Langevin">
<text>Sir Hector-Louis Langevin, (August 25, 1826 – June 11, 1906) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and one of the Fathers of Confederation.

==Early life and education==
Langevin was born in Quebec City in 1826. He studied law and was called to the bar in 1850.

==Political career==
In 1856, he was elected to the municipal council of Quebec City, he was mayor from 1858 to 1861. In 1857, he was elected Member of Parliament for Dorchester in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada as a member of the Conservative Party. He held various positions in Cabinet, including Solicitor General (1864–66), Postmaster General (1866–67), Secretary of State for Canada (1867–69), Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs (1868–69), Minister of Public Works (1869–73) and acting Minister of Militia and Defence (1873). Langevin also attended all three conferences leading to Confederation. He left politics in 1873 due to his role in the Pacific Scandal.

In 1871 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the provincial electoral district of Québec-Centre. At the time, dual mandates were still allowed. He served one term, until 1874.

In 1876, he was re-elected in the riding of Charlevoix. His opponent contested the election and it was declared invalid, but he won the subsequent by-election in 1877. He was defeated in Rimouski in 1878 but elected by acclamation in the riding of Trois-Rivières in the same year. Langevin became Minister of Public Works again in 1879. He lobbied behind the scenes against the hanging of Louis Riel in 1885 and was one of the few Conservatives Members of Parliament to survive the resulting backlash in the province of Quebec in 1887.

He was promised the post of Lieutenant Governor of Quebec by the new Conservative Prime Minister John Abbott if he resigned as Minister of Public Works. Langevin stepped down in 1891 but Abbott appointed Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau instead. That year, Langevin was implicated with Thomas McGreevy in what became known as the &quot;McGreevy-Langevin scandal&quot; over kickbacks to McGreevy associated with federal contracts granted to him by the department of public works overseen by Langevin. He retired to the backbenches and then left politics in 1896.

Outside politics he was previously a newspaper editor.

==View on Indigenous Canadians==
In 1883 he stated in Parliament &quot;In order to educate the (‘Indian’) children properly we must separate them from their families. Some people may say that this is hard but if we want to civilize them we must do that.&quot; &quot;The fact is that if you wish to educate the children you must separate them from their parents during the time they are being taught. If you leave them in the family they may know how to read and write, but they will remain savages, whereas by separating them in the way proposed, they acquire the habits and tastes…of civilized people.&quot;

==Posthumous recognition==
The Langevin Block office building on Parliament Hill and the Langevin Bridge in Calgary were formerly named in his honour. Langevin&#x27;s group of honours insignia was sold at auction in Ottawa on May 18, 2010 for $8000.00

On January 23, 2017, Calgary City Council voted to rename the Langevin Bridge to the Reconciliation Bridge. In June 2017 it was announced the Langevin Block would be renamed to the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council building due to Langevin&#x27;s involvement in the Canadian Indian residential school system. In June 2021 a Calgary Board of Education public school was renamed Riverside School, after being Langevin school from 1936 until 2021.

==Personal life==
His brother, Jean Langevin was a Roman Catholic bishop.

<doc id="249903" wikidata="Q7315983" url="?curid=249903" title="Responsibility assumption">
<text>In existential psychotherapy, responsibility assumption is the doctrine, practiced by therapists such as Irvin D. Yalom where an individual taking responsibility for the events and circumstances in their lives is seen as a necessary basis for their making any genuine change.

From the therapist&#x27;s viewpoint, the goal is to identify these events and circumstances, always operating, in Yalom&#x27;s words, &quot;within the frame of reference that the patient has created his[/her] own distress&quot;.
Then the therapist must &quot;find ways to communicate this insight to the patient&quot;.

The problem that Yalom seeks to address is that of seemingly passive patients, with therapists shouldering the entire burden of the therapy because they think that that is what they must do. 
A &quot;sluggish&quot; patient can be &quot;galvaniz[ed] into action&quot; by asking the simple question: &quot;Why do you come?&quot;. Other techniques including scenarios where other people assume responsibility, and drawing a parallel between those scenarios and the patient&#x27;s own.

In detail, techniques involve:

* Highlighting ways in which the client avoids responsibility, such as by using &quot;cannot&quot; for situations where &quot;will not&quot; is the case, and generates defences against the assumption of responsibility. This also involves confronting a client with the client&#x27;s own behaviours. A client that, for example, complains of loneliness is reminded of this—&quot;Is it any wonder that you are lonely?&quot;—whenever the client belittles other people.
* Highlighting responsibility avoidance even in the therapist-client relationship itself, by observing any transfer of responsibility from the client to the therapist (&quot;Tell me what to do!&quot;) and behaviours of the client towards the therapist that reflect responsibility avoidance in the client&#x27;s life.
* Encouraging the assumption of responsibility for how the client deals with adverse external circumstances, such as serious illness and the client assuming responsibility for behaviour towards doctors.
* Encouraging the conversion of guilt about lack of self-actualization into assuming more responsibility for that lack.
* Confronting low affect, and encouraging the client to have desires and wishes for change, which become the seeds for a &quot;will&quot; to change, the mere &quot;wish&quot; to change being the first step towards that.
* Ungluing decision making processes stuck through fear, encouraging empowerment and the exercise of choice.

Assumption of responsibility does not by itself motivate behavioural change. It must be accompanied by a will to change.

<doc id="249904" wikidata="Q185443" url="?curid=249904" title="Three-valued logic">
<text>In logic, a three-valued logic (also trinary logic, trivalent, ternary, or trilean, sometimes abbreviated 3VL) is any of several many-valued logic systems in which there are three truth values indicating &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, and some third value. This is contrasted with the more commonly known bivalent logics (such as classical sentential or Boolean logic) which provide only for &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

Emil Leon Post is credited with first introducing additional logical truth degrees in his 1921 theory of elementary propositions. The conceptual form and basic ideas of three-valued logic were initially published by Jan Łukasiewicz and Clarence Irving Lewis. These were then re-formulated by Grigore Constantin Moisil in an axiomatic algebraic form, and also extended to &quot;n&quot;-valued logics in 1945.

==Pre-discovery==
Around 1910, Charles Sanders Peirce defined a many-valued logic system. He never published it. In fact, he did not even number the three pages of notes where he defined his three-valued operators. Peirce soundly rejected the idea all propositions must be either true or false; boundary-propositions, he writes, are &quot;at the limit between P and not P.&quot; However, as confident as he was that &quot;Triadic Logic is universally true,&quot; he also jotted down that &quot;All this is mighty close to nonsense.&quot; Only in 1966, when Max Fisch and Atwell Turquette began publishing what they rediscovered in his unpublished manuscripts, did Peirce&#x27;s triadic ideas become widely known.

== Motivation ==

Broadly speaking, the primary motivation for research of three valued logic is to represent the truth value of a statement that cannot be represented as true or false. Łukasiewicz initially developed three-valued logic for the problem of future contingents to represent the truth value of statements about the undetermined future. Bruno de Finetti used a third value to represent when &quot;a given individual does not know the [correct] response, at least at a given moment.&quot; Hilary Putnam used it to represent values that cannot physically be decided:

Similarly, Stephen Cole Kleene used a third value to represent predicates that are &quot;undecidable by [any] algorithms whether true or false&quot;

== Representation of values ==
As with bivalent logic, truth values in ternary logic may be represented numerically using various representations of the ternary numeral system. A few of the more common examples are:
* in balanced ternary, each digit has one of 3 values: −1, 0, or +1; these values may also be simplified to −, 0, +, respectively;
* in the redundant binary representation, each digit can have a value of −1, 0, 0/1 (the value 0/1 has two different representations);
* in the ternary numeral system, each digit is a &quot;trit&quot; (trinary digit) having a value of: 0, 1, or 2;
* in the skew binary number system, only the least-significant non-zero digit can have a value of 2, and the remaining digits have a value of 0 or 1;
* 1 for &quot;true&quot;, 2 for &quot;false&quot;, and 0 for &quot;unknown&quot;, &quot;unknowable&quot;/&quot;undecidable&quot;, &quot;irrelevant&quot;, or &quot;both&quot;;
* 0 for &quot;false&quot;, 1 for &quot;true&quot;, and a third non-integer &quot;maybe&quot; symbol such as ?, #, , or xy.

Inside a ternary computer, ternary values are represented by ternary signals.

This article mainly illustrates a system of ternary propositional logic using the truth values {false, unknown, true}, and extends conventional Boolean connectives to a trivalent context.

== Logics ==
Boolean logic allows 22 = 4 unary operators; the addition of a third value in ternary logic leads to a total of 33 = 27 distinct operators on a single input value. (This may be made clear by considering all possible truth tables for an arbitrary unary operator. Given 2 possible values TF of the single Boolean input, there are four different patterns of output TT, TF, FT, FF resulting from the following unary operators acting on each value: always T, Identity, NOT, always F. Given three possible values of a ternary variable, each times three possible results of a unary operation, there are 27 different output patterns: TTT, TTU, TTF, TUT, TUU, TUF, TFT, TFU, TFF, UTT, UTU, UTF, UUT, UUU, UUF, UFT, UFU, UFF, FTT, FTU, FTF, FUT, FUU, FUF, FFT, FFU, and FFF.) Similarly, where Boolean logic has 22×2 = 16 distinct binary operators (operators with 2 inputs) possible, ternary logic has 33×3 = 19,683 such operators. Where the nontrival Boolean operators can be named (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, XNOR (equivalence), and 4 variants of implication or inequality), with six trivial operators considering 0 or 1 inputs only, it is unreasonable to attempt to name all but a small fraction of the possible ternary operators. Just as in bivalent logic, where not all operators are given names and subsets of functionally complete operators are used, there may be functionally complete sets of ternary-valued operators.

=== Kleene and Priest logics ===

Below is a set of truth tables showing the logic operations for Stephen Cole Kleene&#x27;s &quot;strong logic of indeterminacy&quot; and Graham Priest&#x27;s &quot;logic of paradox&quot;.

If the truth values 1, 0, and -1 are interpreted as integers, these operations may be expressed with the ordinary operations of arithmetic (where &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; uses addition, &quot;xy&quot; uses multiplication, and &quot;x2&quot; uses exponentiation), or by the minimum/maximum functions:
:formula_1

In these truth tables, the &quot;unknown&quot; state can be thought of as neither true nor false in Kleene logic, or thought of as both true and false in Priest logic. The difference lies in the definition of tautologies. Where Kleene logic&#x27;s only designated truth value is T, Priest logic&#x27;s designated truth values are both T and U. In Kleene logic, the knowledge of whether any particular &quot;unknown&quot; state secretly represents &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; at any moment in time is not available. However, certain logical operations can yield an unambiguous result, even if they involve an &quot;unknown&quot; operand. For example, because &quot;true&quot; OR &quot;true&quot; equals &quot;true&quot;, and &quot;true&quot; OR &quot;false&quot; also equals &quot;true&quot;, then &quot;true&quot; OR &quot;unknown&quot; equals &quot;true&quot; as well. In this example, because either bivalent state could be underlying the &quot;unknown&quot; state, and either state also yields the same result, &quot;true&quot; results in all three cases.

If numeric values, e.g. balanced ternary values, are assigned to &quot;false&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;true&quot; such that &quot;false&quot; is less than &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot; is less than &quot;true&quot;, then A AND B AND C... = MIN(A, B, C ...) and A OR B OR C ... = MAX(A, B, C...).

Material implication for Kleene logic can be defined as:

formula_2, and its truth table is

which differs from that for Łukasiewicz logic (described below).

Kleene logic has no tautologies (valid formulas) because whenever all of the atomic components of a well-formed formula are assigned the value Unknown, the formula itself must also have the value Unknown. (And the only &quot;designated&quot; truth value for Kleene logic is True.) However, the lack of valid formulas does not mean that it lacks valid arguments and/or inference rules. An argument is semantically valid in Kleene logic if, whenever (for any interpretation/model) all of its premises are True, the conclusion must also be True. (The Logic of Paradox (LP) has the same truth tables as Kleene logic, but it has two &quot;designated&quot; truth values instead of one; these are: True and Both (the analogue of Unknown), so that LP does have tautologies but it has fewer valid inference rules).

=== Łukasiewicz logic ===

The Łukasiewicz Ł3 has the same tables for AND, OR, and NOT as the Kleene logic given above, but differs in its definition of implication in that &quot;unknown implies unknown&quot; is true. This section follows the presentation from Malinowski&#x27;s chapter of the &quot;Handbook of the History of Logic&quot;, vol 8.

Material implication for Łukasiewicz logic truth table is
In fact, using Łukasiewicz&#x27;s implication and negation, the other usual connectives may be derived as:
* 

It is also possible to derive a few other useful unary operators (first derived by Tarski in 1921):
* 

They have the following truth tables:

M is read as &quot;it is not false that...&quot; or in the (unsuccessful) Tarski–Łukasiewicz attempt to axiomatize modal logic using a three-valued logic, &quot;it is possible that...&quot; L is read &quot;it is true that...&quot; or &quot;it is necessary that...&quot; Finally I is read &quot;it is unknown that...&quot; or &quot;it is contingent that...&quot;

In Łukasiewicz&#x27;s Ł3 the designated value is True, meaning that only a proposition having this value everywhere is considered a tautology. For example, and are tautologies in Ł3 and also in classical logic. Not all tautologies of classical logic lift to Ł3 &quot;as is&quot;. For example, the law of excluded middle, , and the law of non-contradiction, are not tautologies in Ł3. However, using the operator defined above, it is possible to state tautologies that are their analogues:
* (law of excluded fourth)
* (extended contradiction principle).

=== RM3 logic ===

The truth table for the material implication of R-mingle 3 (RM3) is
A defining characteristic of RM3 is the lack of the axiom of Weakening:
which, by adjointness, is equivalent to the projection from the product:
RM3 is a non-cartesian symmetric monoidal closed category; the product, which is left-adjoint to the implication, lacks valid projections, and has as the monoid identity.
This logic is equivalent to an &quot;ideal&quot; paraconsistent logic which also obeys the contrapositive.

=== HT logic ===
The logic of here and there (HT, also referred as Smetanov logic SmT or as Gödel G3 logic), introduced by Heyting in 1930 as a model for studying intuitionistic logic, is a three-valued intermediate logic where the third truth value NF (not false) has the semantics of a proposition that can be intuitionistically proven to not be false, but does not have an intuitionistic proof of correctness.


It may be defined either by appending one of the two equivalent axioms or equivalently to the axioms of intuitionistic logic, or by explicit truth tables for its operations. In particular, conjunction and disjunction are the same as for Kleene&#x27;s and Łukasiewicz&#x27;s logic, while the negation is different.

HT logic is the unique coatom in the lattice of intermediate logics. In this sense it may be viewed as the &quot;second strongest&quot; intermediate logic after classical logic.

=== Bochvar logic ===
This logic is also known as a weak form of Kleene&#x27;s three-valued logic.
=== Ternary Post logic ===
: not(a) = (a + 1) mod 3, or
: not(a) = (a + 1) mod (n), where (n) is the value of a logic

=== Modular algebras ===
Some 3VL modulars arithmetics have been introduced more recently, motivated by circuit problems rather than philosophical issues:
* Cohn algebra
* Pradhan algebra
* Dubrova and Muzio algebra

== Applications ==

=== SQL ===
The database query language SQL implements ternary logic as a means of handling comparisons with NULL field content. SQL uses a common fragment of the Kleene K3 logic, restricted to AND, OR, and NOT tables.

<text>Setun () was a computer developed in 1958 at Moscow State University. It was built under the leadership of Sergei Sobolev and Nikolay Brusentsov. It was the most modern ternary computer, using the balanced ternary numeral system and three-valued ternary logic instead of the two-valued binary logic prevalent in other computers.

==Overview==
The computer was built to fulfill the needs of Moscow State University. It was manufactured at the Kazan Mathematical plant. Fifty computers were built from 1959 until 1965, when production was halted. The characteristic operating memory consisted of 81 words of memory, each word composed of 18 trits (ternary digits) with additional 1944 words on magnetic drum (total of about 7 KB). Between 1965 and 1970, a regular binary computer was used at Moscow State University to replace it. Although this replacement binary computer performed equally well, it was 2.5 times the cost of the Setun.

In 1970, a new ternary computer architecture, the Setun-70, was developed. Edsger W. Dijkstra&#x27;s ideas of structured programming were implemented in the hardware of this computer. The short instructions set was developed and implemented by Nikolay Brusentsov independently from RISC architecture principles.

The Setun-70 hardware architecture was transformed into the Dialogue System of Structured Programming (DSSP). DSSP emulates the &quot;Setun 70&quot; architecture on binary computers, thus it fulfills the advantages of structured programming. DSSP programming language has similar syntax to the Forth programming language but has a different sequence of base instructions, especially conditional jump instructions. DSSP was developed by Nikolay Brusentsov and doctoral students in the 1980s at Moscow State University. A 32-bit version was implemented in 1989.

<text>In the religion of ancient Rome, a haruspex was a person trained to practise a form of divination called haruspicy, the inspection of the entrails of sacrificed animals, especially the livers of sacrificed sheep and poultry. 
Various ancient cultures of the Near East, such as the Babylonians, also read omens specifically from the liver, a practice also known by the Greek term hepatoscopy (also hepatomancy).

The Roman concept is directly derived from Etruscan religion, as one of the three branches of the &quot;disciplina Etrusca&quot;.

The Latin terms &quot;haruspex&quot; and &quot;haruspicina&quot; are from an archaic word, &quot;hīra&quot; = &quot;entrails, intestines&quot; (cognate with &quot;hernia&quot; = &quot;protruding viscera&quot; and &quot;hira&quot; = &quot;empty gut&quot;; PIE &quot;*ǵʰer-&quot;) and from the root &quot;spec-&quot; = &quot;to watch, observe&quot;. The Greek ἡπατοσκοπία &quot;hēpatoskōpia&quot; is from &quot;hēpar&quot; = &quot;liver&quot; and &quot;skop-&quot; = &quot;to examine&quot;.

==Ancient Near East==


The Babylonians were famous for hepatoscopy. This practice is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel 21:21:

One Babylonian clay model of a sheep&#x27;s liver, dated between 1900 and 1600 BC, is conserved in the British Museum.

The Assyro-Babylonian tradition was also adopted in Hittite religion. At least thirty-six liver-models have been excavated at Hattusa. Of these, the majority are inscribed in Akkadian, but a few examples also have inscriptions in the native Hittite language, indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native, vernacular cult.

==Ancient Italy==
Roman haruspicy was a form of communication with the gods. Rather than strictly predicting future events, this form of Roman divination allowed humans to discern the attitudes of the gods and react in a way that would maintain harmony between the human and divine worlds (pax deorum). Before taking important actions, especially in battle, Romans conducted animal sacrifices to discover the will of the gods according to the information gathered through reading the animals&#x27; entrails. The entrails (most importantly the liver, but also the lungs and heart) contained a large number of signs that indicated the gods&#x27; approval or disapproval. These signs could be interpreted according to the appearance of the organs, for example, if the liver was &quot;smooth, shiny and full&quot; or &quot;rough and shrunken&quot;. The Etruscans looked for the &quot;caput iocineris&quot;, or &quot;head of the liver&quot;. It was considered a bad omen if this part was missing from the animal&#x27;s liver. The haruspex would then study the flat visceral side of the liver after examining the &quot;caput iocineris&quot;.

Haruspicy in Ancient Italy originated with the Etruscans. Textual evidence for Etruscan divination comes from an Etruscan inscription: the priest Laris Pulenas&#x27; (250–200 BCE) epitaph mentions a book he wrote on haruspicy. A collection of sacred texts called the &quot;Etrusca disciplina&quot;, written in Etruscan, were essentially guides on different forms of divination, including haruspicy and augury. In addition, a number of archeological artifacts depict Etruscan haruspicy. These include a bronze mirror with an image of a haruspex dressed in Etruscan priest&#x27;s clothing, holding a liver while a crowd gathers near him. Another significant artifact relating to haruspicy in Ancient Italy is the Piacenza Liver. This bronze model of a sheep&#x27;s liver was found by chance by a farmer in 1877. Names of gods are etched into the surface and organized into different sections. Artifacts depicting haruspicy exist from the ancient Roman world as well, such as stone relief carvings located in Trajan&#x27;s Forum.

==Northeast Africa==
In southwest Ethiopia and adjacent area of South Sudan, a number of ethnic communities have had the practice of reading animal entrails to divine the future. Some of the groups that have been documented as having this practice include Suri, Mursi, Topsa, Nyangatom, Didinga, Murle, Me&#x27;en, Turkana, Konso, Dime, Karamojong, Dodoth, Kalenjin people

Haruspication has also been practiced in Kenya, such as the Kamba and the Kipsikis.

<text>Phonotactics (from Ancient Greek &#x27;voice, sound&#x27; and &#x27;having to do with arranging&#x27;) is a branch of phonology that deals with restrictions in a language on the permissible combinations of phonemes. Phonotactics defines permissible syllable structure, consonant clusters and vowel sequences by means of &quot;phonotactic constraints&quot;.

Phonotactic constraints are highly language-specific. For example, in Japanese, consonant clusters like do not occur. Similarly, the clusters and are not permitted at the beginning of a word in Modern English but are permitted in German and were permitted in Old and Middle English. In contrast, in some Slavic languages and are used alongside vowels as syllable nuclei.

Syllables have the following internal segmental structure:
* Onset (optional)
* Rhyme (obligatory, comprises nucleus and coda):
** Nucleus (obligatory)
** Coda (optional)

Both onset and coda may be empty, forming a vowel-only syllable, or alternatively, the nucleus can be occupied by a syllabic consonant. Phonotactics is known to affect second language vocabulary acquisition.

==English phonotactics==
The English syllable (and word) &quot;twelfths&quot; is divided into the onset , the nucleus and the coda ; thus, it can be described as CCVCCCC (C = consonant, V = vowel). On this basis it is possible to form rules for which representations of phoneme classes may fill the cluster. For instance, English allows at most three consonants in an onset, but among native words under standard accents (and excluding a few obscure loanwords such as &quot;sphragistics&quot;), phonemes in a three-consonantal onset are limited to the following scheme:

: + stop + approximant:
::*&quot;strap&quot;
:* + + (not in most accents of American English)
::*&quot;stew&quot;
::*&quot;sputum&quot;
::*&quot;sprawl&quot;
::*&quot;splat&quot;
::*&quot;skew&quot;
::*&quot;scream&quot;
::*&quot;sclerosis&quot;
::*&quot;squirrel&quot;

This constraint can be observed in the pronunciation of the word &quot;blue&quot;: originally, the vowel of &quot;blue was identical to the vowel of &quot;cue, approximately . In most dialects of English, shifted to . Theoretically, this would produce . The cluster , however, infringes the constraint for three-consonantal onsets in English. Therefore, the pronunciation has been reduced to by elision of the in what is known as yod-dropping.

Not all languages have this constraint; compare Spanish or French .

Constraints on English phonotactics include:

* All syllables have a nucleus
* No geminate consonants
* No onset 
* No in the syllable coda (except in Hiberno-English)
* No affricates in complex onsets (except when underlying and are analysed as and )
* No in complex onsets
* The first consonant in a complex onset must be an obstruent (e.g. stop&quot;; combinations such as &quot;*ntat&quot; or *rkoop&quot;, with a sonorant, are not allowed)
* The second consonant in a complex onset must not be a voiced obstruent (e.g. &quot;*zdop&quot; does not occur)
* If the first consonant in a complex onset is not , the second must be a liquid or a glide
* Every subsequence contained within a sequence of consonants must obey all the relevant phonotactic rules (the substring principle rule)
* No glides in syllable codas (excluding the s of diphthongs)
* The second consonant in a complex coda must not be , , , or (compare &quot;asthma&quot;, typically pronounced or , but rarely )
* If the second consonant in a complex coda is voiced, so is the first
* An obstruent following or in a coda must be homorganic with the nasal
* Two obstruents in the same coda must share voicing (compare &quot;kids with &quot;kits )

==Sonority Sequencing Principle==

Segments of a syllable are universally distributed following the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP), which states that, in any syllable, the nucleus has maximal sonority and that sonority decreases as you move away from the nucleus. Sonority is a measure of the amplitude of a speech sound. The particular ranking of each speech sound by sonority, called the sonority hierarchy, is language-specific, but, in its broad lines, hardly varies from a language to another, which means all languages form their syllables in approximately the same way with regards to sonority.

To illustrate the SSP, the voiceless alveolar fricative is lower on the sonority hierarchy than the alveolar lateral approximant , so the combination is permitted in onsets and is permitted in codas, but is not allowed in onsets and is not allowed in codas. Hence &quot;slips&quot; and &quot;pulse&quot; are possible English words while &quot;*lsips&quot; and &quot;*pusl&quot; are not.

The SSP expresses a very strong cross-linguistic tendency, however, it does not account for the patterns of all complex syllable margins, as there are both initial as well as final clusters violation the SSP, in two ways: the first occurs when two segments in a margin have the same sonority, which is known as a &quot;sonority plateau&quot;. Such margins are found in a few languages, including English, as in the words &quot;sphinx&quot; and &quot;fact&quot; (though note that &quot;phsinx&quot; and &quot;fatc&quot; both violate English phonotactics).

The second instance of violation of the SSP is when a peripheral segment of a margin has a higher sonority than a segment closer to the nucleus. These margins are known as reversals and occur in some languages including English (&quot;steal&quot; , &quot;bets&quot; ) or French (&#x27; but originally , &#x27; ).

<text>Joseph Marquis Dupleix (; Unknown – 10 November 1763) was Governor-General of French India and rival of Robert Clive.

==Biography==
Dupleix was born in Landrecies, on January 23, 1697. His father, François Dupleix, a wealthy &quot;fermier général&quot;, wished to bring him up as a merchant, and, in order to distract him from his taste for science, sent him on a voyage to India in 1715 on one of the French East India Company&#x27;s vessels. He made several voyages to the Americas and India, and in 1720 was named a member of the superior council at Bengal. He displayed great business aptitude, and in addition to his official duties made large ventures on his own account, acquiring a fortune.

In 1730 he was made superintendent of French affairs in Chandernagore. In 1741, he married Jeanne Albert, widow of one of the councillors of the company. Albert was known to the Hindus as Joanna Begum and proved of great help to her husband in his negotiations with the native princes.

His reputation procured him in 1742 the appointment of governor general of all French establishments in India. Dupleix saw in the constant succession disputes among the Princes of India an opportunity to advance the interests of the French in India, and for this purpose he entered into relations with the native princes, and adopted a style of oriental splendour in his dress and surroundings. He built an army of native troops, called sepoys, who were trained as infantry men in his service and also included the famous Hyder Ali of Mysore.

The British were alarmed by this, but the danger to their settlements and power was partly averted by the bitter mutual jealousy which existed between Dupleix and Bertrand François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, French governor of the Isle of Bourbon (today&#x27;s La Réunion).

When the city of Madras capitulated to the French following the Battle of Madras in 1746, Dupleix opposed that the town be returned under British rule, thus violating the treaty signed by La Bourdonnais. He then sent an expedition against Fort St David (1747), which won over the Nawab of Arcot, ally of the British. Dupleix again attempted the capture of Fort St David, and this time succeeded.

In 1748 Kolkata was besieged by the French, but in the course of the operations news arrived of the peace concluded between the French and the British at Aix-la-Chapelle. Dupleix next entered into negotiations about the subjugation of southern India. He sent a large body of troops to the aid of the two claimants of the sovereignty of the Carnatic and the Deccan. The British sided with their rivals to prevent the plans of Dupleix from materializing.

In 1750 the Subadar of Deccan gifted the Alamparai Fort to the French. This was a token of his appreciation of the services of Dupleix and the French forces to his services.

From 1751, Dupleix tried to expand French influence in Burma by sending the envoy Sieur de Bruno, and by providing military assistance the Mon in their conflict with the Burmese. Bruno proved remarkably successful in this effort, resulting in closer ties between the French and the Mon. However, the advent of the Seven Years&#x27; War meant that as French attentions were elsewhere this relationship came to nothing.

In 1754 the French government, anxious to make peace, sent out to India a special commissioner with orders to supersede Dupleix and, if necessary, to arrest him. These orders were carried out harshly, what survived of Dupleix&#x27;s work was ruined at a blow, and he himself was compelled to embark for France on 12 October 1754. He had spent his private fortune in the prosecution of his public policy, but the company refused to acknowledge the obligation, and the government would do nothing for a man whom they persisted in regarding as an ambitious and greedy adventurer. He died in obscurity on 10 November 1763.

== Commemoration ==

A number of things were named in his honour: 
* A square, road and metro station in the 15th &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Paris are named after him.
* Four French warships have borne his name (beside two commercial ships):
** The steam corvette (1861–1887), famous for her involvement in the Japanese revolution
** A 7,700-tonne armoured cruiser (1897–1919) 
** A 10,000-tonne cruiser (1929–1942), scuttled in Toulon 
** The F70 type frigate 
* College Dupleix was the former name of Kanailal Vidyamandir and the Chandannagar College in Chandannagar, West Bengal.
* A road in New Delhi near the Indian parliament named after him.
* &quot;Rue Dupleix&quot; (&quot;Dupleix Street&quot;) was the former name of Nehru Street in Pondicherry.

===Statue of Dupleix at Puducherry Beach===

French recognition of his Dupliex&#x27;s contribution came only in 1870, with the commissioning of two statues – one in Puducherry and the other in France. The former statue is now situated in Goubert Avenue at the end of Rock Beach. It was first installed on 16 July 1870. In 1979 the statue was moved from the middle of the current Bharathy park to its current location at the beach.

Dupleix is represented as a man of commanding stature. In the large nose and massive under jaw, some resemblance may be traced to Oliver Cromwell as commonly represented in his portraits. In the statue, Dupleix wears Court dress with bag wig and long riding boots; in his right hand is a plan of Puducherry, his left reposing on the hilt of his sword.

Restoration of the Dupleix statue was undertaken by the Public Works Department (PWD) of the government of Puducherry in 2014.

<doc id="249918" wikidata="Q18554095" url="?curid=249918" title="Autonomic neuropathy">
<text>Autonomic neuropathy (AN or AAN) is a form of polyneuropathy that affects the non-voluntary, non-sensory nervous system (i.e., the autonomic nervous system), affecting mostly the internal organs such as the bladder muscles, the cardiovascular system, the digestive tract, and the genital organs. These nerves are not under a person&#x27;s conscious control and function automatically. Autonomic nerve fibers form large collections in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis outside the spinal cord. They have connections with the spinal cord and ultimately the brain, however. Most commonly autonomic neuropathy is seen in persons with long-standing diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2. In most—but not all—cases, autonomic neuropathy occurs alongside other forms of neuropathy, such as sensory neuropathy.

Autonomic neuropathy is one cause of malfunction of the autonomic nervous system (referred to as dysautonomia), but not the only one; some conditions affecting the brain or spinal cord also may cause autonomic dysfunction, such as multiple system atrophy, and therefore, may cause similar symptoms to autonomic neuropathy.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include the following:
* Urinary bladder conditions: urinary incontinence or urinary retention which happens due to the uncoordinated contraction of the bladder. Neurogenic bladder is a broad term describing this dysfunction.
* Gastrointestinal tract: dysphagia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, diarrhea, constipation
* Cardiovascular system: disturbances of heart rate (tachycardia, bradycardia), orthostatic hypotension, inadequate increase of heart rate on exertion
* Respiratory system: impairments in the signals associated with regulation of breathing and gas exchange (central sleep apnea, hypopnea, bradypnea).
* Nervous system: pupillary defect, exaggerated hippus, dizziness or lightheadedness.
* Other areas: hypoglycemia unawareness, genital impotence, sweat disturbances, sicca (dryness).
* Absence of signs of cerebellar dysfunction or parkinsonian symptoms as the presence of either would indicate the more serious disease of multiple system atrophy.

== Causes ==
Many health conditions can cause autonomic neuropathy. Some common causes of autonomic neuropathy include:
* Diabetes, which is the most common cause of autonomic neuropathy, can gradually cause nerve damage throughout the body.
* Vitamin B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia)
* Injury to nerves caused by surgery or radiation to the neck.
* Treatment with certain medications, including some drugs used in cancer chemotherapy.
* Abnormal protein buildup in organs (amyloidosis), which affects the organs and the nervous system.
* An abnormal attack by the immune system (autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy), sometimes as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome which can occur even when cancer has not yet been diagnosed.
* Certain infectious diseases. Some viruses and bacteria, such as botulism, Lyme disease and HIV, can cause autonomic neuropathy.
* Inherited disorders. Certain hereditary disorders can cause autonomic neuropathy.
* Autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system attacks and damages parts of the body, including the nerves. Examples include Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and celiac disease. Guillain–Barré syndrome is an autoimmune disease that happens rapidly and can affect autonomic nerves.

== Diagnosis ==

== Treatment ==

=== Neurogenic bladder ===
Depending on the symptoms and severity of the neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the doctor might suggest one of the following treatments

* Behavioral changes: such as reducing water intake, kegel exercises, biofeedback training
* Clean intermittent catheterization: insertion of a foley catheter to remove the urine every few hours and prevent retention, done in a sterile manner. 
* Pharmacological therapy, which includes anticholinergic drugs which reduce the contraction of the bladder
* Botox injections into the bladder
* Surgical treatment: Urinary diversion, Artificial Urinary Sphincter, Urethral sling, or insertion of electrical devices adjacent to the bladder to stimulate its contraction.

<doc id="249919" wikidata="Q268452" url="?curid=249919" title="Basal rate">
<text>Basal rate, in biology, is the rate of continuous supply of some chemical or process. In the case of diabetes mellitus, it is a low rate of continuous insulin supply needed for such purposes as controlling cellular glucose and amino acid uptake.

Together with a bolus of insulin, the basal insulin completes the total insulin needs of an insulin-dependent person.
An insulin pump and wristop controller is one way to arrange for a closely controlled basal insulin rate. The slow-release insulins (e.g., Lantus and Levemir) can provide a similar effect.

In healthy individuals, basal rate is monitored by the pancreas, which provides a regular amount of insulin at all times. The body requires this flow of insulin to enable the body to utilize glucose in the blood stream, so the energy in glucose can be used to carry out bodily functions. Basal rate requirements can differ for individuals depending on the activities they will carry out on that particular day. For example, if one is not highly active on a certain day, they will have a decreased basal rate because they are not using a lot of energy. On the other hand, basal rate increases dramatically when an individual is highly active.

Basal rates often even vary from hour to hour throughout the day. For example, one&#x27;s insulin needs vary from activity to activity. Activities, such as sports, housework, shopping, gardening, tidying the house, and consuming alcohol all require a lowering in basal rate. These activities all require energy and, thus, use glucose; basal rate must decrease in order to keep glucose levels high enough to be used as fuel for the body. On the other hand, fevers, having a cold, taking a nap, taking cortisone-containing medication, and moments of excitement call for different basal rate needs. In these instances, the body has an overwhelming supply of glucose, and glucose levels need to decrease. To induce this decrease, basal rate needs to increase to increase insulin release to absorb some of the excess glucose from the blood stream.

Those with diabetes mellitus must be aware of their basal rates and regulate them accordingly. Basal rate can be raised and lowered through various methods. For example, individuals with diabetes mellitus often use an insulin pump to supply an increased amount of insulin into the blood stream. Those with diabetes also may eat carbohydrates or sugars to account for low blood sugar. However one monitors and regulates their blood sugar levels and basal rates, it is important to make changes gradually. An initial lowering in basal rate should be no more than 10% of the original. After the initial lowering point, one must note the factor by which one&#x27;s blood sugar changes. If blood sugar levels decreased, one should lower their basal rate by 20% next time. If their blood sugar levels increased, a lowering of 10% was too great, and one should not lower their basal rate at all next time. If blood sugar levels remained relatively constant, a drop in basal rate of 10% was sufficient.

Just as the action to change basal rate should be gradual in nature, the actual response from changing basal rate does not happen instantly. A change in basal rate is felt around two hours after the action is done. This is especially important for those with diabetes to note, as it affects when they should act to monitor their basal rates. For example, if there is a particular time in the day when one notices a problem with blood glucose levels, they should act to change their basal rate accordingly two hours prior to when the problem was previously experienced.

==Causes of Basal Rate==
The liver is the primary contributing organ which produces glucose continuously even when nothing is being eaten. The liver will supply glucose either from fats or from previously eaten foods. Therefore, the basal rate can be thought of as a sort of &quot;second bolus&quot; after the initial bolus intake of insulin.

==Modelling the Basal Rate==
Most adult diabetics (over the age of 21) will have a fairly constant ratio of bolus:basal of 60%:40%, where 60% of all insulin intake in a single 24-hour period will be attributed to meals (bolus) and 40% should then be attributed to the basal rate. This ratio will fluctuate from person to person depending on their size, activity level, and caloric intake as well but is a good baseline for determining the correct basal rate for an adult diabetic. Thus, the basal rate could theoretically be set based on an averaged bolus insulin intake of several days. Averaging the total bolus, and then dividing this number by 36 would then give the required hourly basal rate intake for any individual with a 60:40 ratio established.

<doc id="249921" wikidata="Q852574" url="?curid=249921" title="Bunion">
<text>A bunion, also known as hallux valgus, is a deformity of the MTP joint connecting the big toe to the foot. The big toe often bends towards the other toes and the joint becomes red and painful. The onset of bunions is typically gradual. Complications may include bursitis or arthritis.
The exact cause is unclear. Proposed factors include wearing overly tight shoes, high-heeled shoes, family history, and rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and supported by X-rays. A similar condition of the little toe is referred to as a bunionette.
Treatment may include proper shoes, orthotics, or NSAIDs. If this is not effective for improving symptoms, surgery may be performed. It affects about 23% of adults. Females are affected more often than males. Usual age of onset is between 20 and 50 years old. The condition also becomes more common with age. It was first clearly described in 1870. Archaeologists have identified a high incidence of bunions in skeletons from 14th- and 15th-century England, coinciding with a fashion for pointy shoes.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms may include irritation of the skin around the bunion, and blisters may form more easily at the site. Pain may be worse when walking.

Bunions can lead to difficulties finding properly fitting footwear and may force a person to buy a larger size shoe to accommodate the width of the bunion. If the bunion deformity becomes severe enough, the foot can hurt in different places even without the constriction of shoes. It is then considered as being a mechanical function problem of the forefoot.

==Cause==
The exact cause is unclear. It may be due to a combination of internal and external causes. Proposed factors include wearing overly tight shoes, high-heeled shoes, family history and rheumatoid arthritis. The American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons states that footwear only worsens a problem caused by genetics.

Excessive pronation of the foot causes increased pressure on the inside of the big toe that can result in a deformation of the medial capsular structures of the joint, subsequently increasing the risk of developing bunions.

== Pathophysiology ==
The bump itself is partly due to the swollen bursal sac or an osseous (bony) anomaly on the metatarsophalangeal joint. The larger part of the bump is a normal part of the head of the first metatarsal bone that has tilted sideways to stick out at its distal (far) end (metatarsus primus varus).

Bunions are commonly associated with a deviated position of the big toe toward the second toe, and the deviation in the angle between the first and second metatarsal bones of the foot. The small sesamoid bones found beneath the first metatarsal (which help the flexor tendon bend the big toe downwards) may also become deviated over time as the first metatarsal bone drifts away from its normal position. Osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, diminished or altered range of motion, and discomfort with pressure applied to the bump or with motion of the joint, may all accompany bunion development. Atop of the first metatarsal head either medially or dorso-medially, there can also arise a bursa that when inflamed (bursitis), can be the most painful aspect of the process.

==Diagnosis==
Bunions can be diagnosed and analyzed with a simple x-ray, which should be taken with the weight on the foot. The &quot;hallux valgus angle&quot; (HVA) is the angle between the long axes of the proximal phalanx and the first metatarsal bone of the big toe. It is considered abnormal if greater than 15–18°. The following HV angles can also be used to grade the severity of hallux valgus:

* Mild: 15–20°
* Moderate: 21–39°
* Severe: ≥ 40°

The &quot;intermetatarsal angle&quot; (IMA) is the angle between the longitudinal axes of the first and second metatarsal bones, and is normally less than 9°. The IM angle can also grade the severity of hallux valgus as:

* Mild: 9–11°
* Moderate: 12–17°
* Severe: ≥ 18°

== Treatment ==
Conservative treatment for bunions include changes in footwear, the use of orthotics (accommodative padding and shielding), rest, ice, and pain medications such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These treatments address symptoms but do not correct the actual deformity. If the discomfort persists and is severe or when aesthetic correction of the deformity is desired, surgical correction by an orthopedic surgeon or a podiatric surgeon may be necessary.

=== Orthotics ===
Orthotics are splints or regulators while conservative measures include various footwear like toe spacers, valgus splints, and bunion shields. Toe spacers seem to be effective in reducing pain, but there is no evidence that any of these techniques reduces the physical deformity. There are a variety of available orthotics including off-the-shelf commercial products and custom-molded orthotics, which may be prescribed medical devices.

=== Surgery ===
Procedures are designed and chosen to correct a variety of pathologies that may be associated with the bunion. For instance, procedures may address some combination of:

* removing the abnormal bony enlargement of the first metatarsal,
* realigning the first metatarsal bone relative to the adjacent metatarsal bone,
* straightening the great toe relative to the first metatarsal and adjacent toes,
* realigning the cartilaginous surfaces of the great toe joint,
* addressing arthritic changes associated with the great toe joint,
* repositioning the sesamoid bones beneath the first metatarsal bone,
* shortening, lengthening, raising, or lowering the first metatarsal bone,
* correcting any abnormal bowing or misalignment within the great toe,
* connecting two parallel long bones side by side by syndesmosis procedure

At present there are many different bunion surgeries for different effects. The age, health, lifestyle and activity level of the patient may also play a role in the choice of procedure.

Traditional bunion surgery can be performed under local, spinal or general anesthetic. A person who has undergone bunion surgery can expect a 6- to 8-week recovery period during which crutches are usually required to aid mobility. An orthopedic cast is much less common today as newer, more stable procedures and better forms of fixation (stabilizing the bone with screws and other hardware) are used. Hardware may even include absorbable pins that perform their function and are then broken down by the body over the course of months. After recovery long term stiffness or limited range of motion may occur in some patients. Visible or limited scarring may also occur for patients.

<doc id="249922" wikidata="Q2197452" url="?curid=249922" title="Callus">
<text>A callus (: calluses) is an area of thickened and sometimes hardened skin that forms as a response to repeated friction, pressure, or other irritation. Since repeated contact is required, calluses are most often found on the feet and hands, but they may occur anywhere on the skin. Some degree of callus, such as on the bottom of the foot, is normal.

Calluses are generally not harmful and help prevent blisters, as well as offering protection. However, excessive formation may sometimes lead to other problems, such as a skin ulceration or infection, or cause the affected person to try to offload the affected painful area, which can place excessive stress on the asymptomatic side.

Rubbing that is too frequent or forceful will cause blisters, as opposed to calluses, to form.

==Cause==
Normally, a callus will form on any part of the skin exposed to excess friction over a long period of time. Activities that are known for causing calluses include construction work and craftwork, the arts, food preparation, many sports and physical activities, and fashion choices like wearing high heels.

Although calluses can occur anywhere on the body as a reaction to moderate, constant &quot;grinding&quot; pressure, they are most often found on the foot (where the most pressure and friction are applied). On the feet (arguably the source of the most problematic calluses), they typically form on the metatarsal-phalangeal joint area (&quot;balls of the foot&quot;), heels and small toes due to the compression applied by tightly fitting shoes.

Biologically, calluses are formed by the accumulation of terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost layer of skin. Though the cells of calluses are dead, they are quite resistant to mechanical and chemical damage due to extensive networks of cross-linked proteins and hydrophobic keratin intermediate filaments containing many disulfide bonds. It is the natural reaction of the palmar or plantar skin. Too much friction occurring too fast for the skin to develop a protective callus will cause a blister or abrasion instead.

Sometimes a callus occurs where there is no rubbing or pressure. These hyperkeratoses can have a variety of causes. Some toxic materials, such as arsenic, can cause thick palms and soles. Some diseases, such as syphilis, can cause thickening of the palms and soles as well as pinpoint hyperkeratoses. There is a benign condition called &quot;keratosis palmaris et plantaris&quot;, which produces corns in the creases of the fingers and non-weight bearing spaces of the feet. Some of this may be caused by actinic keratosis, which occurs due to overexposure to sun or with age and hormonal shifts.

===Corns===

A corn (or &quot;clavus&quot;, plural &quot;clavi&quot;) is a cone-shaped callus that penetrates into the dermis, usually on the feet or hands. Corns may form due to chronic pressure or rubbing at a pressure point (in this skin over a bone), or due to scar tissue from a healing wound creating pressure in a weight-bearing area such as the sole of the foot. If there is constant stimulation of the tissue producing the corns, even after the corn is surgically removed, the skin may continue to grow as a corn.

The hard part at the center of the corn resembles a funnel with a broad raised top and a pointed bottom. Because of their shape, corns intensify the pressure at the tip and can cause deep tissue damage and ulceration. The scientific name for a corn is &quot;heloma&quot; (plural &quot;helomata&quot;). A hard corn is called a &quot;heloma durum&quot;, while a soft corn is called a &quot;heloma molle&quot;.

The location of the soft corns tends to differ from that of hard corns. Hard corns occur on dry, flat surfaces of skin. Soft corns (frequently found between adjacent toes) stay moist, keeping the surrounding skin soft. The corn&#x27;s center is not soft however, but indurated.

The specific diagnostic workup and treatments for corns may differ substantially from other forms of calluses.

==Prevention==
Corns and calluses are easier to prevent than to treat. When it is undesirable to form a callus, minimizing rubbing and pressure will prevent callus formation. Footwear should be properly fitted, gloves may be worn, and protective pads, rings or skin dressings may be used. People with poor circulation or sensation should check their skin often for signs of rubbing and irritation so they can minimize any damage.

==Treatment==
Calluses and corns may heal by themselves eventually, once the irritation is consistently avoided. They may also be dissolved with keratolytic agents containing salicylic acid, sanded down with a pumice stone or silicon carbide sandpaper or filed down with a callus shaver, or down by a professional such as a podiatrist.

===Diabetes===
People with diabetes face special skin challenges. Because diabetes affects the capillaries, the small blood vessels which feed the skin, thickening of the skin with callus increases the difficulty of supplying nutrients to the skin. Callus formation is seen in high numbers of patients with diabetes, and together with absent foot pulses and formation of hammer toe, this may be an early sign of individuals at an increased risk for foot ulcers.

The stiffness of a callus or corn, coupled with the shear and pressure that caused it, may tear the capillaries or adjoining tissue, causing bleeding within the callus or corn. This can often be result of trying to pick, cut, or shave off the callus by yourself at home. Although the bleeding can be small, sometimes small pools of blood or hematoma are formed. The blood itself is an irritant, a foreign body within the callus that makes the area burn or itch. If the pool of blood is exposed to the outside, infection may follow. Infection may also lead to ulceration. This process can be prevented at several places. Diabetic foot infections are the leading cause of diabetic limb amputation.

== Society and culture ==
Calluses in the hands are frequently associated with manual labor and blue-collar workers. During the Gads Hill Train Robbery in 1874, the James–Younger Gang purportedly refrained from robbing men with calloused hands, assuming them to be working class laborers. Such notion is also present in Māori culture, where the words &quot;raupā&quot; and &quot;raupo&quot; refer to hands left cracked and chapped due to manual work, and are used as similes for someone deemed a hard worker.

Calluses have also been known to develop on the forehead from the frequent prostrations required in Muslim prayer; known as a prayer bump or &quot;zebiba&quot;, such calluses are considered marks of piety in some Muslim countries, and people have been known to take special steps, such as praying on straw mats, to encourage the callus to develop.

Calluses may also form on the fingertips from the repeated pressure and friction of playing stringed instruments. This formation of calluses allows the player to repeatedly depress the strings without causing pain. Because of this, callus formation is viewed as something of a rite of passage for beginner string players.

<doc id="249924" wikidata="Q3010352" url="?curid=249924" title="Cerebrovascular disease">
<text>Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion. Other risk factors that contribute to stroke include smoking and diabetes. Narrowed cerebral arteries can lead to ischemic stroke, but continually elevated blood pressure can also cause tearing of vessels, leading to a hemorrhagic stroke.

A stroke usually presents with an abrupt onset of a neurologic deficit – such as hemiplegia (one-sided weakness), numbness, aphasia (language impairment), or ataxia (loss of coordination) – attributable to a focal vascular lesion. The neurologic symptoms manifest within seconds because neurons need a continual supply of nutrients, including glucose and oxygen, that are provided by the blood. Therefore, if blood supply to the brain is impeded, injury and energy failure is rapid.

Besides hypertension, there are also many less common causes of cerebrovascular disease, including those that are congenital or idiopathic and include CADASIL, aneurysms, amyloid angiopathy, arteriovenous malformations, fistulas, and arterial dissections. Many of these diseases can be asymptomatic until an acute event, such as a stroke, occurs. Cerebrovascular diseases can also present less commonly with headache or seizures. Any of these diseases can result in vascular dementia due to ischemic damage to the brain.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The most common presentation of cerebrovascular diseases is an acute stroke, which occurs when blood supply to the brain is compromised. Symptoms of stroke are usually rapid in onset, and may include weakness of one side of the face or body, numbness on one side of the face or body, inability to produce or understand speech, vision changes, and balance difficulties. Hemorrhagic strokes can present with a very severe, sudden headache associated with vomiting, neck stiffness, and decreased consciousness. Symptoms vary depending on the location and the size of the area of involvement of the stroke. Edema, or swelling, of the brain may occur which increases intracranial pressure and may result in brain herniation. A stroke may result in coma or death if it involves key areas of the brain.

Other symptoms of cerebrovascular disease include migraines, seizures, epilepsy, or cognitive decline. However, cerebrovascular disease may go undetected for years until an acute stroke occurs. In addition, patients with some rare congenital cerebrovascular diseases may begin to have these symptoms in childhood.

== Causes ==
=== Congenital ===
Congenital diseases are medical conditions that are present at birth that may be associated with or inherited through genes. Examples of congenital cerebrovascular diseases include arteriovenous malformations, germinal matrix hemorrhage, and CADASIL (cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). Arteriovenous malformations are abnormal tangles of blood vessels. Usually, a capillary bed separates arteries from veins, which protects the veins from the higher blood pressures that occur in arteries. In arteriovenous malformations, arteries are directly connected to veins, which increases the risk of venous rupture and hemorrhage. Cerebral arteriovenous malformations in the brain have a 2–4% chance of rupture each year. However, many arteriovenous malformations go unnoticed and are asymptomatic throughout a person&#x27;s lifetime.

A germinal matrix hemorrhage is bleeding into the brain of premature infants caused by the rupture of fragile blood vessels within the germinal matrix of premature babies. The germinal matrix is a highly vascularized area within an unborn infant&#x27;s brain from which brain cells, including neurons and glial cells, originate. Infants are at most risk to germinal matrix hemorrhages when they are born prematurely, before 32 weeks. The stresses exposed after birth, along with the fragile blood vessels, increase risk of hemorrhage. Signs and symptoms include flaccid weakness, seizures, abnormal posturing, or irregular respiration.

CADASIL is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the &quot;NOTCH3&quot; gene located on chromosome 19. &quot;NOTCH3&quot; codes for a transmembrane protein whose function is not well-known. However, the mutation causes accumulation of this protein within small to medium-sized blood vessels. This disease often presents in early adulthood with migraines, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive deterioration. MRI shows white matter changes in the brain and also signs of repeated strokes. The diagnosis can be confirmed by gene testing.

=== Acquired ===
Acquired cerebrovascular diseases are those that are obtained throughout a person&#x27;s life that may be preventable by controlling risk factors. The incidence of cerebrovascular disease increases as an individual ages. Causes of acquired cerebrovascular disease include atherosclerosis, embolism, aneurysms, and arterial dissections. Atherosclerosis leads to narrowing of blood vessels and less perfusion to the brain, and it also increases the risk of thrombosis, or a blockage of an artery, within the brain. Major modifiable risk factors for atherosclerosis include:

Controlling these risk factors can reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis and stroke. Atrial fibrillation is also a major risk factor for strokes. Atrial fibrillation causes blood clots to form within the heart, which may travel to the arteries within the brain and cause an embolism. The embolism prevents blood flow to the brain, which leads to a stroke.

An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging of small sections of arteries, which increases the risk of artery rupture. Intracranial aneurysms are a leading cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage, or bleeding around the brain within the subarachnoid space. There are various hereditary disorders associated with intracranial aneurysms, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and familial hyperaldosteronism type I. However, individuals without these disorders may also obtain aneurysms. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association recommend controlling modifiable risk factors including smoking and hypertension.

Arterial dissections are tears of the internal lining of arteries, often associated with trauma. Dissections within the carotid arteries or vertebral arteries may compromise blood flow to the brain due to thrombosis, and dissections increase the risk of vessel rupture.

=== Idiopathic ===
Idiopathic diseases are those that occur spontaneously without a known cause. Moyamoya is an example of an idiopathic cerebrovascular disorder that results in narrowing and occlusion of intracranial blood vessels. The most common presentation is stroke or transient ischemic attack, but cognitive decline within children may also be a presenting symptom. The disease may begin to show symptoms beginning in adolescence, but some may not have symptoms until adulthood.

== Pathophysiology ==

=== Mechanism of brain cell death ===
When a reduction in blood flow lasting seconds occurs, the brain tissue suffers ischemia, or inadequate blood supply. If the interruption of blood flow is not restored in minutes, the tissue suffers infarction followed by tissue death. When the low cerebral blood flow persists for a longer duration, this may develop into an infarction in the border zones (areas of poor blood flow between the major cerebral artery distributions). In more severe instances, global hypoxia-ischemia causes widespread brain injury leading to a severe cognitive sequelae called &quot;hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy&quot;.

An ischemic cascade occurs where an energetic molecular problem arises due to lack of oxygen and nutrients. The cascade results in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is a high-energy molecule needed for cells in the brain to function. Consumption of ATP continues in spite of insufficient production, this causes total levels of ATP to decrease and lactate acidosis to become established (ionic homeostasis in neurons is lost). The downstream mechanisms of the ischemic cascade thus begins. Ion pumps no longer transport Ca2+ out of cell, this triggers release of glutamate, which in turn allows calcium into cell walls. In the end the apoptosis pathway is initiated and cell death occurs.

There are several arteries that supply oxygen to different areas of the brain, and damage or occlusion of any of them can result in stroke. The carotid arteries cover the majority of the cerebrum. The common carotid artery divides into the internal and the external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery becomes the anterior cerebral artery and the middle central artery. The ACA transmits blood to the frontal parietal. From the basilar artery are two posterior cerebral arteries. Branches of the basilar and PCA supply the occipital lobe, brain stem, and the cerebellum. Ischemia is the loss of blood flow to the focal region of the brain. This produces heterogeneous areas of ischemia at the affected vascular region, furthermore, blood flow is limited to a residual flow. Regions with blood flow of less than 10 mL/100 g of tissue/min are core regions (cells here die within minutes of a stroke). The ischemic penumbra with a blood flow of &lt;25 ml/100g tissue/min, remain usable for more time (hours).

=== Types of stroke ===
There are two main divisions of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke involves decreased blood supply to regions of the brain, while hemorrhagic stroke is bleeding into or around the brain.

==== Ischemic ====
* Ischemic stroke, the most common is caused by a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain, usually caused by thrombosis or emboli from a proximal arterial source or the heart, that leads to the brain being starved of oxygen. The neurologic signs and symptoms must last longer than 24 hours or the brain infarction is demonstrated, mainly by imaging techniques.
* Transient ischemic attack (TIA) also called a &quot;mini-stroke&quot;. This is a condition in which the blood flow to a region of the brain is blocked, but blood flow is quickly restored and the brain tissue can fully recover. The symptoms are only transient, leaving no sequelae, or long-term deficits. In order to diagnose this entity, &quot;all neurologic signs and symptoms must have been resolved within 24 hrs without evidence of brain infarction on brain imaging.&quot;

==== Hemorrhagic ====
* Subarachnoid haemorrhage occurs when blood leaks out of damaged vessels into the cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space around the brain. The most common cause of a subarachnoid hemorrhage is an aneurysm rupture due to the weakened blood vessel walls and increased wall stress. The neurologic symptoms are produced by the blood mass effect on neural structures, from the toxic effects of blood on the brain tissue, or by the increasing of intracranial pressure.
* Intracerebral haemorrhage is bleeding directly into the brain rather than around the brain. Causes and risk factors include hypertension, blood thinning medications, trauma, and arteriovenous malformations.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease may include:
* medical history
* physical exam
* neurological examination
* acute stroke imaging is generally performed in significant symptoms of new onset

It is important to differentiate the symptoms caused by a stroke from those caused by syncope (fainting) which is also a reduction in cerebral blood flow, almost always generalized, but they are usually caused by systemic hypotension of various origins: cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic shock, among others.

==Treatment==
Treatment for cerebrovascular disease may include medication, lifestyle changes, and surgery, depending on the cause.

Examples of medications are:
* antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel)
* blood thinners (heparin, warfarin)
* antihypertensives:
** ACE inhibitors
** beta blockers
** calcium channel blockers - in particular Nimodipine reduces the incidence and severity of ischemic deficits in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
* anti-diabetic medications.

Surgical procedures include:
* endovascular surgery and vascular surgery (for future stroke prevention).

==Prognosis==
Prognostics factors:
Lower Glasgow Coma Scale score, higher pulse rate, higher respiratory rate and lower arterial oxygen saturation level is prognostic features of in-hospital mortality rate in acute ischemic stroke.

== Epidemiology ==
Worldwide, it is estimated there are 31 million stroke survivors, though about 6 million deaths were due to cerebrovascular disease (2nd most common cause of death in the world and 6th most common cause of disability).

Cerebrovascular disease primarily occurs with advanced age; the risk for developing it goes up significantly after 65 years of age. CVD tends to occur earlier than Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease (which is rare before the age of 80). In some countries such as Japan, CVD is more common than AD.

In 2012, 6.4 million adults from the US had a stroke, which corresponds to 2.7% of the US. This is approximately 129,000 deaths in 2013.

Geographically, a &quot;stroke belt&quot; in the US has long been known, similar to the &quot;diabetes belt&quot; which includes all of Mississippi and parts of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.

<text>Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart&#x27;s ability to fill with and pump blood.

Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.

Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy. These cause heart failure by altering the structure or the function of the heart or in some cases both. There are different types of heart failure: right-sided heart failure, which affects the right heart, left-sided heart failure, which affects the left heart, and biventricular heart failure, which affects both sides of the heart. Left-sided heart failure may be present with a reduced ejection fraction or with a preserved ejection fraction. Heart failure is not the same as cardiac arrest, in which blood flow stops completely due to the failure of the heart to pump.

Diagnosis is based on symptoms, physical findings, and echocardiography. Blood tests, and a chest x-ray may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on severity and case. For people with chronic, stable, or mild heart failure, treatment usually consists of lifestyle changes, such as not smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, along with beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended. Diuretics may also be prescribed to prevent fluid retention and the resulting shortness of breath. Depending on the case, an implanted device such as a pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator may sometimes be recommended. In some moderate or more severe cases, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or cardiac contractility modulation may be beneficial. In severe disease that persists despite all other measures, a cardiac assist device ventricular assist device, or, occasionally, heart transplantation may be recommended.

Heart failure is a common, costly, and potentially fatal condition, and is the leading cause of hospitalization and readmission in older adults. Heart failure often leads to more drastic health impairments than the failure of other, similarly complex organs such as the kidneys or liver. In 2015, it affected about 40 million people worldwide. Overall, heart failure affects about 2% of adults, and more than 10% of those over the age of 70. Rates are predicted to increase.

The risk of death in the first year after diagnosis is about 35%, while the risk of death in the second year is less than 10% in those still alive. The risk of death is comparable to that of some cancers. In the United Kingdom, the disease is the reason for 5% of emergency hospital admissions. Heart failure has been known since ancient times in Egypt; it is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus around 1550 BCE.
== Definition ==
When the heart functions poorly as a pump and does not circulate blood adequately via the circulatory system to meet the demands of the body, the term &#x27;cardiovascular insufficiency&#x27; is sometimes used. This generally leads to the syndrome of heart failure, a combination of signs and symptoms when the heart functions poorly as a pump. This leads to high filling pressure in the left atrium with fluid accumulation and water retention. Most of the visible signs of heart failure are the result of this fluid accumulation (edema) and the adjective is added to the definition of heart failure. Impaired ejection can lead to inadequate blood flow to the body tissues, resulting in ischemia.

==Signs and symptoms==

Congestive heart failure is a pathophysiological condition in which the heart&#x27;s output is insufficient to meet the needs of the body and lungs. The term &quot;congestive heart failure&quot; is often used because one of the most common symptoms is or fluid accumulation in the tissues and veins of the lungs or other parts of a person&#x27;s body.

Congestion manifests itself particularly in the form of fluid accumulation and swelling (edema), in the form of peripheral edema (causing swollen limbs and feet) and pulmonary edema (causing difficulty breathing) and ascites (swollen abdomen). Pulse pressure, which is the difference between the systolic (&quot;top number&quot;) and diastolic (&quot;bottom number&quot;) blood pressures, is often low/narrow (i.e. 25% or less of the level of the systolic) in people with heart failure, and this can be an early warning sign.

Symptoms of heart failure are traditionally divided into left-sided and right-sided because the left and right ventricles supply different parts of the circulation. In biventricular heart failure, both sides of the heart are affected. Left-sided heart failure is the more common.

===Left-sided failure===
The left side of the heart takes oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the circulatory system in the body (except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up into the lungs, causing breathing difficulties and fatigue due to an insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs include increased respiratory rate and labored breathing (nonspecific signs of shortness of breath). Rales or crackles are heard initially in the lung bases and when severe in all lung fields indicate the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis, indicates deficiency of oxygen in the blood, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema.

Other signs of left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs when the heart is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional heart sounds), which may be heard as a sign of increased blood flow or increased intracardiac pressure. Heart murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e.g., aortic stenosis) or as a consequence (e.g., mitral regurgitation) of heart failure.

&quot;Reverse&quot; insufficiency of the left ventricle causes congestion in the blood vessels of the lungs so that symptoms are predominantly respiratory. Reverse insufficiency can be divided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle, or both within the left circuit. Patients will experience shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion and, in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness while lying down, called orthopnea, also occurs. It can be measured by the number of pillows required to lie comfortably, with extreme cases of orthopnea forcing the patient to sleep sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nocturnal attack of severe shortness of breath, usually occurring several hours after falling asleep. There may be &quot;cardiac asthma&quot; or wheezing. Impaired left ventricular &quot;forward&quot; function can lead to symptoms of poor systemic perfusion such as dizziness, confusion, and cool extremities at rest. Loss of consciousness may also occur due to loss of blood supply to the brain.

===Right-sided failure===
Right-sided heart failure is often caused by pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by issues with pulmonary circulation such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis. Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema, ascites, liver enlargement, and spleen enlargement. Jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by testing hepatojugular reflux. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a parasternal heave which causes the compensatory increase in contraction strength may be present.

&quot;Backward&quot; failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (peripheral edema or anasarca) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first, causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down. Nocturia (frequent night-time urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive hepatopathy), jaundice, and coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting).

===Biventricular failure===
Dullness of the lung fields when percussed and reduced breath sounds at the base of the lungs may suggest the development of a pleural effusion (fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right-sided.

If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increases stress on the right ventricle. Though still harmful, right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the left side.

==Causes==
Since heart failure is a syndrome and not a disease, establishing the underlying cause is vital to diagnosis and treatment. In heart failure, the structure or the function of the heart or in some cases both are altered. Heart failure is the potential end stage of all heart diseases.

Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, including a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excess alcohol use, infection, and cardiomyopathy of an unknown cause. In addition, viral infection and subsequent inflammation of the heart&#x27;s myocardial tissue (termed myocarditis) can similarly contribute to the development of heart failure. Genetic predisposition plays an important role. If more than one cause is present, progression is more likely and prognosis is worse.

Heart damage can predispose a person to develop heart failure later in life and has many causes including systemic viral infections (e.g., HIV), chemotherapeutic agents such as daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab and substance use disorders of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. An uncommon cause is exposure to certain toxins such as lead and cobalt. Additionally, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus have similar consequences. Obstructive sleep apnea (a condition of sleep wherein disordered breathing overlaps with obesity, hypertension, and/or diabetes) is regarded as an independent cause of heart failure. Recent reports from clinical trials have also linked variation in blood pressure to heart failure and cardiac changes that may give rise to heart failure.

===High-output heart failure===
High-output heart failure happens when the amount of blood pumped out is more than typical and the heart cannot keep up. This can occur in overload situations such as blood or serum infusions, kidney diseases, chronic severe anemia, beriberi (vitamin B1/thiamine deficiency), hyperthyroidism, cirrhosis, Paget&#x27;s disease, multiple myeloma, arteriovenous fistulae, or arteriovenous malformations.

===Acute decompensation===
Chronic stable heart failure may easily decompensate (fail to meet the body&#x27;s metabolic needs). This most commonly results from a concurrent illness (such as myocardial infarction (a heart attack) or pneumonia), abnormal heart rhythms, uncontrolled hypertension, or a person&#x27;s failure to maintain a fluid restriction, diet, or medication.

Other factors that may worsen CHF include: anemia, hyperthyroidism, excessive fluid or salt intake, and medication such as NSAIDs and thiazolidinediones. NSAIDs increase the risk twofold.

===Medications===
A number of medications may cause or worsen the disease. This includes NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, a number of anesthetic agents such as ketamine, thiazolidinediones, some cancer medications, several antiarrhythmic medications, pregabalin, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, minoxidil, itraconazole, cilostazol, anagrelide, stimulants (e.g., methylphenidate), tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, antipsychotics, dopamine agonists, TNF inhibitors, calcium channel blockers (especially verapamil and diltiazem), salbutamol, and tamsulosin.

By inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins, NSAIDs may exacerbate heart failure through several mechanisms, including promotion of fluid retention, increasing blood pressure, and decreasing a person&#x27;s response to diuretic medications. Similarly, the ACC/AHA recommends against using COX-2 inhibitor medications in people with heart failure. Thiazolidinediones have been strongly linked to new cases of heart failure and worsening of pre-existing congestive heart failure due to their association with weight gain and fluid retention. Certain calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem and verapamil, are known to decrease the force with which the heart ejects blood, thus are not recommended in people with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction.

Breast cancer patients are at high risk of heart failure due to several factors. After analyzing data from 26 studies (836,301 patients), the recent meta-analysis found that breast cancer survivors demonstrated a higher risk heart failure within first ten years after diagnosis (hazard ratio = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.33). The pooled incidence of heart failure in breast cancer survivors was 4.44 (95% CI 3.33-5.92) per 1000 person-years of follow-up.

===Supplements===
Certain alternative medicines carry a risk of exacerbating existing heart failure, and are not recommended. This includes aconite, ginseng, gossypol, gynura, licorice, lily of the valley, tetrandrine, and yohimbine. Aconite can cause abnormally slow heart rates and abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia. Ginseng can cause abnormally low or high blood pressure and may interfere with the effects of diuretic medications. Gossypol can increase the effects of diuretics, leading to toxicity.

Gynura can cause low blood pressure. Licorice can worsen heart failure by increasing blood pressure and promoting fluid retention. Lily of the Valley can cause abnormally slow heart rates with mechanisms similar to those of digoxin. Tetrandrine can lower blood pressure by inhibiting L-type calcium channels. Yohimbine can exacerbate heart failure by increasing blood pressure through alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonism.

==Pathophysiology==

 Heart failure is caused by any condition that reduces the efficiency of the heart muscle, through damage or overloading. Over time, these increases in workload, which are mediated by long-term activation of neurohormonal systems such as the renin–angiotensin system and the sympathoadrenal system, lead to fibrosis, dilation, and structural changes in the shape of the left ventricle from elliptical to spherical.

The heart of a person with heart failure may have a reduced force of contraction due to overloading of the ventricle. In a normal heart, increased filling of the ventricle results in increased contraction force by the Frank–Starling law of the heart, and thus a rise in cardiac output. In heart failure, this mechanism fails, as the ventricle is loaded with blood to the point where heart muscle contraction becomes less efficient. This is due to the reduced ability to cross-link actin and myosin myofilaments in over-stretched heart muscle.

==Diagnosis==
No diagnostic criteria have been agreed on as the gold standard for heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends measuring N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) followed by an ultrasound of the heart if positive. In Europe, the European Society of Cardiology, and in the United States, the AHA/ACC/HFSA, recommend measuring NT-proBNP or BNP followed by an ultrasound of the heart if positive. This is recommended in those with symptoms consistent with heart failure such as shortness of breath.

The European Society of Cardiology defines the diagnosis of heart failure as symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure in combination with &quot;objective evidence of cardiac structural or functional abnormalities&quot;. This definition is consistent with an international 2021 report termed &quot;Universal Definition of Heart Failure&quot;. Score-based algorithms have been developed to help in the diagnosis of HFpEF, which can be challenging for physicians to diagnose. The AHA/ACC/HFSA defines heart failure as symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure in combination with shown &quot;structural and functional alterations of the heart as the underlying cause for the clinical presentation&quot;, for HFmrEF and HFpEF specifically requiring &quot;evidence of spontaneous or provokable increased left ventricle filling pressures&quot;.

=== Algorithms ===
The European Society of Cardiology has developed a diagnostic algorithm for HFpEF, named HFA-PEFF. HFA-PEFF considers symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, ECG, and echocardiography.

=== Classification ===
==== &quot;Left&quot;, &quot;right&quot; and mixed heart failure ====
One historical method of categorizing heart failure is by the side of the heart involved (left heart failure versus right heart failure). Right heart failure was thought to compromise blood flow to the lungs compared to left heart failure compromising blood flow to the aorta and consequently to the brain and the remainder of the body&#x27;s systemic circulation. However, mixed presentations are common, and left heart failure is a common cause of right heart failure.

==== By ejection fraction ====
A more accurate classification of heart failure type is made by measuring ejection fraction, or the proportion of blood pumped out of the heart during a single contraction. Ejection fraction is given as a percentage with the normal range being between 50 and 75%. The types are:
# Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): Synonyms no longer recommended are &quot;heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction&quot; and &quot;systolic heart failure&quot;. HFrEF is associated with an ejection fraction less than 40%.
# Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), previously called &quot;heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction&quot;, is defined by an ejection fraction of 41–49%.
# Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): Synonyms no longer recommended include &quot;diastolic heart failure&quot; and &quot;heart failure with normal ejection fraction.&quot; HFpEF occurs when the left ventricle contracts normally during systole, but the ventricle is stiff and does not relax normally during diastole, which impairs filling.
# Heart failure with recovered ejection fraction (HFrecovEF or HFrecEF): patients previously with HFrEF with complete normalization of left ventricular ejection (≥50%).

Heart failure may also be classified as acute or chronic. Chronic heart failure is a long-term condition, usually kept stable by the treatment of symptoms. Acute decompensated heart failure is a worsening of chronic heart failure symptoms, which can result in acute respiratory distress. High-output heart failure can occur when there is increased cardiac demand that results in increased left ventricular diastolic pressure which can develop into pulmonary congestion (pulmonary edema).

Several terms are closely related to heart failure and may be the cause of heart failure, but should not be confused with it. Cardiac arrest and asystole refer to situations in which no cardiac output occurs at all. Without urgent treatment, these events result in sudden death. Myocardial infarction (&quot;Heart attack&quot;) refers to heart muscle damage due to insufficient blood supply, usually as a result of a blocked coronary artery. Cardiomyopathy refers specifically to problems within the heart muscle, and these problems can result in heart failure. Ischemic cardiomyopathy implies that the cause of muscle damage is coronary artery disease. Dilated cardiomyopathy implies that the muscle damage has resulted in enlargement of the heart. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy involves enlargement and &quot;thickening&quot; of the heart muscle.

===Ultrasound===
An echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) is commonly used to support a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. This can determine the stroke volume (SV, the amount of blood in the heart that exits the ventricles with each beat), the end-diastolic volume (EDV, the total amount of blood at the end of diastole), and the SV in proportion to the EDV, a value known as the ejection fraction (EF). In pediatrics, the shortening fraction is the preferred measure of systolic function. Normally, the EF should be between 50 and 70%; in systolic heart failure, it drops below 40%. Echocardiography can also identify valvular heart disease and assess the state of the pericardium (the connective tissue sac surrounding the heart). Echocardiography may also aid in deciding specific treatments, such as medication, insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or cardiac resynchronization therapy. Echocardiography can also help determine if acute myocardial ischemia is the precipitating cause, and may manifest as regional wall motion abnormalities on echo.

===Chest X-ray===

Chest X-rays are frequently used to aid in the diagnosis of CHF. In a person who is compensated, this may show cardiomegaly (visible enlargement of the heart), quantified as the cardiothoracic ratio (proportion of the heart size to the chest). In left ventricular failure, evidence may exist of vascular redistribution (upper lobe blood diversion or cephalization), Kerley lines, cuffing of the areas around the bronchi, and interstitial edema. Ultrasound of the lung may also detect Kerley lines.
===Electrophysiology===
An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) may be used to identify arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, right and left ventricular hypertrophy, and presence of conduction delay or abnormalities (e.g. left bundle branch block). Although these findings are not specific to the diagnosis of heart failure, a normal ECG virtually excludes left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

===Blood tests===
N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) is the favored biomarker for the diagnosis of heart failure, according to guidelines published 2018 by NICE in the UK. Brain natriuretic peptide 32 (BNP) is another biomarker commonly tested for heart failure. An elevated NT-proBNP or BNP is a specific test indicative of heart failure. Additionally, NT-proBNP or BNP can be used to differentiate between causes of dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes of dyspnea. If a myocardial infarction is suspected, various cardiac markers may be used.

Blood tests routinely performed include electrolytes (sodium, potassium), measures of kidney function, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, a complete blood count, and often C-reactive protein if infection is suspected.

Hyponatremia (low serum sodium concentration) is common in heart failure. Vasopressin levels are usually increased, along with renin, angiotensin II, and catecholamines to compensate for reduced circulating volume due to inadequate cardiac output. This leads to increased fluid and sodium retention in the body; the rate of fluid retention is higher than the rate of sodium retention in the body, this phenomenon causes hypervolemic hyponatremia (low sodium concentration due to high body fluid retention). This phenomenon is more common in older women with low body mass. Severe hyponatremia can result in accumulation of fluid in the brain, causing cerebral edema and intracranial hemorrhage.

===Angiography===
Angiography is the X-ray imaging of blood vessels, which is done by injecting contrast agents into the bloodstream through a thin plastic tube (catheter), which is placed directly in the blood vessel. X-ray images are called angiograms. Heart failure may be the result of coronary artery disease, and its prognosis depends in part on the ability of the coronary arteries to supply blood to the myocardium (heart muscle). As a result, coronary catheterization may be used to identify possibilities for revascularisation through percutaneous coronary intervention or bypass surgery.

===Staging===
Heart failure is commonly stratified by the degree of functional impairment conferred by the severity of the heart failure, as reflected in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification. The NYHA functional classes (I–IV) begin with class I, which is defined as a person who experiences no limitation in any activities and has no symptoms from ordinary activities. People with NYHA class II heart failure have slight, mild limitations with everyday activities; the person is comfortable at rest or with mild exertion. With NYHA class III heart failure, a marked limitation occurs with any activity; the person is comfortable only at rest. A person with NYHA class IV heart failure is symptomatic at rest and becomes quite uncomfortable with any physical activity. This score documents the severity of symptoms and can be used to assess response to treatment. While its use is widespread, the NYHA score is not very reproducible and does not reliably predict walking distance or exercise tolerance on formal testing.

In its 2001 guidelines, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association working group introduced four stages of heart failure:
* Stage A: People at high risk for developing HF in the future, but no functional or structural heart disorder
* Stage B: A structural heart disorder, but no symptoms at any stage
* Stage C: Previous or current symptoms of heart failure in the context of an underlying structural heart problem, but managed with medical treatment
* Stage D: Advanced disease requiring hospital-based support, a heart transplant, or palliative care

The ACC staging system is useful since stage A encompasses &quot;pre-heart failure&quot; – a stage where intervention with treatment can presumably prevent progression to overt symptoms. ACC stage A does not have a corresponding NYHA class. ACC stage B would correspond to NYHA class I. ACC stage C corresponds to NYHA class II and III, while ACC stage D overlaps with NYHA class IV.
* The degree of coexisting illness: i.e. heart failure/systemic hypertension, heart failure/pulmonary hypertension, heart failure/diabetes, heart failure/kidney failure, etc.
* Whether the problem is primarily increased venous back pressure (preload), or failure to supply adequate arterial perfusion (afterload)
* Whether the abnormality is due to low cardiac output with high systemic vascular resistance or high cardiac output with low vascular resistance (low-output heart failure vs. high-output heart failure)

===Histopathology===

Histopathology can diagnose heart failure in autopsies. The presence of siderophages indicates chronic left-sided heart failure, but is not specific for it. It is also indicated by congestion of the pulmonary circulation.

==Prevention==
A person&#x27;s risk of developing heart failure is inversely related to the level of physical activity. Those who achieved at least 500 MET-minutes/week (the recommended minimum by U.S. guidelines) had lower heart failure risk than individuals who did not report exercising during their free time; the reduction in heart failure risk was even greater in those who engaged in higher levels of physical activity than the recommended minimum.
Heart failure can also be prevented by lowering high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, and by controlling diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight, and decreasing sodium, alcohol, and sugar intake, may help. Additionally, avoiding tobacco use has been shown to lower the risk of heart failure.

According to Johns Hopkins and the American Heart Association there are a few ways to help prevent a cardiac event. Johns Hopkins states that stopping tobacco use, reducing high blood pressure, physical activity, and nutrition can drastically affect the chances of developing heart disease. High blood pressure accounts for most cardiovascular deaths. High blood pressure can be lowered into the normal range by making dietary decisions such as consuming less salt. Exercise also helps to bring blood pressure back down. One of the best ways to help avoid heart failure is to promote healthier eating habits like eating more vegetables, fruits, grains, and lean protein.

Diabetes is a major risk factor for heart failure. For women with Coronary Heart disease (CHD), diabetes was the strongest risk factor for heart failure. Diabetic women with depressed creatinine clearance or elevated BMI were at the highest risk of heart failure. While the annual incidence rate of heart failure for non-diabetic women with no risk factors is 0.4%, the annual incidence rate for diabetic women with elevated body mass index (BMI) and depressed creatinine clearance was 7% and 13%, respectively.

==Management==

Treatment focuses on improving the symptoms and preventing the progression of the disease. Reversible causes of heart failure also need to be addressed (e.g. infection, alcohol ingestion, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, arrhythmia, and hypertension). Treatments include lifestyle and pharmacological modalities, and occasionally various forms of device therapy. Rarely, cardiac transplantation is used as an effective treatment when heart failure has reached the end stage.

===Acute decompensation===

In acute decompensated heart failure, the immediate goal is to re-establish adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to end organs. This entails ensuring that airway, breathing, and circulation are adequate. Immediate treatments usually involve some combination of vasodilators such as nitroglycerin, diuretics such as furosemide, and possibly noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in those with oxygen saturation levels below 90%, but is not recommended in those with normal oxygen levels in the normal atmosphere.

===Chronic management===

The goals of treatment for people with chronic heart failure are prolonging life, preventing acute decompensation, and reducing symptoms, allowing for greater activity.

Heart failure can result from a variety of conditions. In considering therapeutic options, excluding reversible causes is of primary importance, including thyroid disease, anemia, chronic tachycardia, alcohol use disorder, hypertension, and dysfunction of one or more heart valves. Treatment of the underlying cause is usually the first approach to treating heart failure. In most cases, though, either no primary cause is found or treatment of the primary cause does not restore normal heart function. In these cases, behavioral, medical and device treatment strategies exist that can provide a significant improvement in outcomes, including the relief of symptoms, exercise tolerance, and a decrease in the likelihood of hospitalization or death. Breathlessness rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure has been proposed with exercise training as a core component. Rehabilitation should also include other interventions to address shortness of breath including the psychological and educational needs of people and the needs of caregivers. Iron supplementation appears to reduce hospitalization but not all-cause mortality in patients with iron deficiency and heart
failure.

==== Advance care planning ====
The latest evidence indicates that advance care planning (ACP) may help to increase documentation by medical staff regarding discussions with participants and improve an individual&#x27;s depression. This involves discussing an individual&#x27;s future care plan, preferences, and values. The findings are, however, based on low-quality evidence.

====Monitoring====
The various measures often used to assess the progress of people being treated for heart failure include fluid balance (calculation of fluid intake and excretion) and monitoring body weight (which in the shorter term reflects fluid shifts). Remote monitoring can be effective to reduce complications for people with heart failure.

====Lifestyle====
Behavior modification is a primary consideration in chronic heart failure management programs, with dietary guidelines regarding fluid and salt intake. Fluid restriction is important to reduce fluid retention in the body and to correct the hyponatremic status of the body. The evidence of the benefit of reducing salt, however, is poor as of 2018. Thirst is a common and burdensome symptom for patients to cope with. Chewing gum is an effective intervention to relieve thirst in patients experiencing heart failure, although patient acceptability remains an issue.

====Exercise and physical activity====
Exercise should be encouraged and tailored to suit an individual&#x27;s capabilities. A meta-analysis found that center-based group interventions delivered by a physiotherapist help promote physical activity in HF. There is a need for additional training for physiotherapists in delivering behavior change intervention alongside an exercise program. An intervention is expected to be more efficacious in encouraging physical activity than the usual care if it includes &quot;Prompts and cues&quot; to walk or exercise, like a phone call or a text message. It is helpful if a trusted clinician provides explicit advice to engage in physical activity (&quot;Credible source&quot;). Another highly effective strategy is to place objects that will serve as a cue to engage in physical activity in the person&#x27;s everyday environment (&quot;Adding object to the environment&quot;; e.g., exercise step or treadmill). Encouragement to walk or exercise in various settings beyond CR (e.g., home, neighborhood, parks) is also promising (&quot;Generalisation of target behavior&quot;). Additional promising strategies are &quot;Graded tasks&quot; (e.g., gradual increase in intensity and duration of exercise training), &quot;Self-monitoring&quot;, &quot;Monitoring of physical activity by others without feedback&quot;, &quot;Action planning&quot;, and &quot;Goal-setting&quot;. The inclusion of regular physical conditioning as part of a cardiac rehabilitation program can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the risk of hospital admission for worsening symptoms, but no evidence shows a reduction in mortality rates as a result of exercise.

Home visits and regular monitoring at heart-failure clinics reduce the need for hospitalization and improve life expectancy.

====Medication====
Quadruple medical therapy using a combination of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2 inhibitors) is the standard of care as of 2021 for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

There is no convincing evidence for pharmacological treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Medication for HFpEF is symptomatic treatment with diuretics to treat congestion. Managing risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension is recommended in HFpEF.

Inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended for heart failure. The angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan is recommended as the first choice of RAS inhibitors in American guidelines published by AHA/ACC in 2022. Use of ACE inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) if the person develops a long-term cough as a side effect of the ACE-I, is associated with improved survival, fewer hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbations, and improved quality of life in people with heart failure. European guidelines published by ESC in 2021 recommends that ARNI should be used in those who still have symptoms while on an ACE-I or ARB, beta blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Use of the combination agent ARNI requires the cessation of ACE-I or ARB therapy at least 36 hours before its initiation.

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta blockers) add to the improvement in symptoms and mortality provided by ACE-I/ARB. The mortality benefits of beta blockers in people with systolic dysfunction who also have atrial fibrillation is more limited than in those who do not have it. If the ejection fraction is not diminished (HFpEF), the benefits of beta blockers are more modest; a decrease in mortality has been observed, but reduction in hospital admission for uncontrolled symptoms has not been observed.

In people who are intolerant of ACE-I and ARB or who have significant kidney dysfunction, the use of combined hydralazine and a long-acting nitrate, such as isosorbide dinitrate, is an effective alternate strategy. This regimen has been shown to reduce mortality in people with moderate heart failure. It is especially beneficial in the black population.

Use of a mineralocorticoid antagonist, such as spironolactone or eplerenone, in addition to beta blockers and ACE-I, can improve symptoms and reduce mortality in people with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

SGLT2 inhibitors are used for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as they have demonstrated benefits in reducing hospitalizations and mortality, regardless of whether an individual has comorbid Type 2 Diabetes or not.

=====Other medications=====
Second-line medications for CHF do not confer a mortality benefit. Digoxin is one such medication. Its narrow therapeutic window, a high degree of toxicity, and the failure of multiple trials to show a mortality benefit have reduced its role in clinical practice. It is now used in only a small number of people with refractory symptoms, who are in atrial fibrillation, and/or who have chronic hypotension.

Diuretics have been a mainstay of treatment against symptoms of fluid accumulation, and include diuretics classes such as loop diuretics (such as furosemide), thiazide-like diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics. Although widely used, evidence on their efficacy and safety is limited, except for mineralocorticoid antagonists such as spironolactone.

Anemia is an independent factor in mortality in people with chronic heart failure. Treatment of anemia significantly improves the quality of life for those with heart failure, often with a reduction in severity of the NYHA classification, and also improves mortality rates. The European Society of Cardiology recommends screening for iron deficiency and treating with intravenous iron if deficiency is found.

The decision to anticoagulate people with HF, typically with left ventricular ejection fractions &lt;35% is debated, but generally, people with coexisting atrial fibrillation, a prior embolic event, or conditions that increase the risk of an embolic event such as amyloidosis, left ventricular noncompaction, familial dilated cardiomyopathy, or a thromboembolic event in a first-degree relative.

Vasopressin receptor antagonists can also treat heart failure. Conivaptan is the first medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of euvolemic hyponatremia in those with heart failure. In rare cases hypertonic 3% saline together with diuretics may be used to correct hyponatremia.

Ivabradine is recommended for people with symptomatic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who are receiving optimized guideline-directed therapy (as above) including the maximum tolerated dose of beta-blocker, have a normal heart rhythm and continue to have a resting heart rate above 70 beats per minute. Ivabradine has been found to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure exacerbations in this subgroup of people with heart failure.

====Implanted devices====
In people with severe cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction below 35%), or in those with recurrent VT or malignant arrhythmias, treatment with an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is indicated to reduce the risk of severe life-threatening arrhythmias. The AICD does not improve symptoms or reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias but does reduce mortality from those arrhythmias, often in conjunction with antiarrhythmic medications. In people with left ventricular ejection (LVEF) below 35%, the incidence of ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death is high enough to warrant AICD placement. Its use is therefore recommended in AHA/ACC guidelines.

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is a treatment for people with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic heart failure (NYHA classes II–IV), which enhances both the strength of ventricular contraction and the heart&#x27;s pumping capacity. The CCM mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by nonexcitatory electrical signals, which are delivered by a pacemaker-like device. CCM is particularly suitable for the treatment of heart failure with normal QRS complex duration (120 ms or less) and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms, quality of life, and exercise tolerance. CCM is approved for use in Europe, and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States in 2019.

About one-third of people with an LVEF below 35% have markedly altered conduction to the ventricles, resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of the right and left ventricles. This is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block (blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originate at the base of the heart and carry depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle). Using a special pacing algorithm, biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization. In people with LVEF below 35% and prolonged QRS duration on ECG (LBBB or QRS of 150 ms or more), an improvement in symptoms and mortality occurs when CRT is added to standard medical therapy. However, in the two-thirds of people without prolonged QRS duration, CRT may be harmful.

====Surgical therapies====
People with the most severe heart failure may be candidates for ventricular assist devices, which have commonly been used as a bridge to heart transplantation but have been used more recently as a destination treatment for advanced heart failure.

In select cases, heart transplantation can be considered. While this may resolve the problems associated with heart failure, the person must generally remain on an immunosuppressive regimen to prevent rejection, which has its own significant downsides. A major limitation of this treatment option is the scarcity of hearts available for transplantation.

===Palliative care===
People with heart failure often have significant symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain. Palliative care should be initiated early in the HF trajectory, and should not be an option of last resort. Palliative care can not only provide symptom management, but also assist with advanced care planning, goals of care in the case of a significant decline, and making sure the person has a medical power of attorney and discussed his or her wishes with this individual. A 2016 and 2017 review found that palliative care is associated with improved outcomes, such as quality of life, symptom burden, and satisfaction with care.

Without transplantation, heart failure may not be reversible and heart function typically deteriorates with time. The growing number of people with stage IV heart failure (intractable symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, or chest pain at rest despite optimal medical therapy) should be considered for palliative care or hospice, according to American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis in heart failure can be assessed in multiple ways, including clinical prediction rules and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Clinical prediction rules use a composite of clinical factors such as laboratory tests and blood pressure to estimate prognosis. Among several clinical prediction rules for prognosticating acute heart failure, the &#x27;EFFECT rule&#x27; slightly outperformed other rules in stratifying people and identifying those at low risk of death during hospitalization or within 30 days. Easy methods for identifying people that are low-risk are:
* ADHERE Tree rule indicates that people with blood urea nitrogen &lt; 43 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure at least 115 mm Hg have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.
* BWH rule indicates that people with systolic blood pressure over 90 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 30 or fewer breaths per minute, serum sodium over 135 mmol/L, and no new ST–T wave changes have less than 10% chance of inpatient death or complications.

A crucial method for assessing prognosis in people with advanced heart failure is cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX testing). CPX testing is usually required before heart transplantation as an indicator of prognosis. CPX testing involves the measurement of exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide during exercise. The peak oxygen consumption (VO2 max) is used as an indicator of prognosis. As a general rule, a VO2 max less than 12–14 cc/kg/min indicates poor survival and suggests that the person may be a candidate for a heart transplant. People with a VO2 max &lt;10 cc/kg/min have a poorer prognosis. The most recent International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines also suggest two other parameters that can be used for evaluation of prognosis in advanced heart failure, the heart failure survival score and the use of a criterion of VE/VCO2 slope &gt; 35 from the CPX test. The heart failure survival score is calculated using a combination of clinical predictors and the VO2 max from the CPX test.

Heart failure is associated with significantly reduced physical and mental health, resulting in a markedly decreased quality of life. With the exception of heart failure caused by reversible conditions, the condition usually worsens with time. Although some people survive many years, progressive disease is associated with an overall annual mortality rate of 10%.

Around 18 of every 1000 persons will experience an ischemic stroke during the first year after diagnosis of HF. As the duration of follow-up increases, the stroke rate rises to nearly 50 strokes per 1000 cases of HF by 5 years.

==Epidemiology==
In 2022, heart failure affected about 64 million people globally. Overall, around 2% of adults have heart failure. In those over the age of 75, rates are greater than 10%.

Rates are predicted to increase. Increasing rates are mostly because of increasing lifespan, but also because of increased risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity) and improved survival rates from other types of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, valvular disease, and arrhythmias). Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in people older than 65.

===United States===
In the United States, heart failure affects 5.8 million people, and each year 550,000 new cases are diagnosed. In 2011, heart failure was the most common reason for hospitalization for adults aged 85 years and older, and the second-most common for adults aged 65–84 years. An estimated one in five adults at age 40 will develop heart failure during their remaining lifetimes and about half of people who develop heart failure die within 5 years of diagnosis. Heart failure much higher in African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and recent immigrants from Eastern Europe countries has been linked in these ethnic minority populations to the high incidence of diabetes and hypertension.

Nearly one of every four people (24.7%) hospitalized in the U.S. with congestive heart failure is readmitted within 30 days. Additionally, more than 50% of people seek readmission within 6 months after treatment and the average duration of hospital stay is 6 days. Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital readmissions in the U.S. People aged 65 and older were readmitted at a rate of 24.5 per 100 admissions in 2011. In the same year, heart failure patients under Medicaid were readmitted at a rate of 30.4 per 100 admissions, and uninsured people were readmitted at a rate of 16.8 per 100 admissions. These are the highest readmission rates for both categories. Notably, heart failure was not among the top-10 conditions with the most 30-day readmissions among the privately insured.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, despite moderate improvements in prevention, heart failure rates have increased due to population growth and aging. Overall heart failure rates are similar to the four most common causes of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, and colon) combined. People from deprived backgrounds are more likely to be diagnosed with heart failure at a younger age.

===Developing world===
In tropical countries, the most common cause of heart failure is valvular heart disease or some type of cardiomyopathy. As underdeveloped countries have become more affluent, the incidences of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity have increased, which have in turn raised the incidence of heart failure.

===Sex===
Men have a higher incidence of heart failure, but the overall prevalence rate is similar in both sexes since women survive longer after the onset of heart failure. Women tend to be older when diagnosed with heart failure (after menopause), they are more likely than men to have diastolic dysfunction, and seem to experience a lower overall quality of life than men after diagnosis.

===Ethnicity===
Some sources state that people of Asian descent are at a higher risk of heart failure than other ethnic groups. Other sources however have found that rates of heart failure are similar to rates found in other ethnic groups.

==History==

For centuries, the disease entity which would include many cases of what today would be called heart failure was &quot;dropsy&quot;; the term denotes generalized edema, a major manifestation of a failing heart, though also caused by other diseases. Writings of ancient civilizations include evidence of their acquaintance with dropsy and heart failure: Egyptians were the first to use bloodletting to relieve fluid accumulation and shortage of breath, and provided what may have been the first documented observations on heart failure in the Ebers papyrus (around 1500 BCE). Greeks described cases of dyspnea, fluid retention and fatigue compatible with heart failure.

Romans used the flowering plant &quot;Drimia maritima&quot; (sea squill), which contains cardiac glycosides, for the treatment of dropsy; descriptions pertaining to heart failure are also known in the civilizations of ancient India and China. However, the manifestations of failing heart were understood in the context of these peoples&#x27; medical theories – including ancient Egyptian religion, Hippocratic theory of humours, or ancient Indian and Chinese medicine, and the current concept of heart failure had not developed yet. Although shortage of breath had been connected to heart disease by Avicenna round 1000 CE, decisive for modern understanding of the nature of the condition were the description of pulmonary circulation by Ibn al-Nafis in the 13th century, and of systemic circulation by William Harvey in 1628.

The role of the heart in fluid retention began to be better appreciated, as &quot;dropsy of the chest&quot; (fluid accumulation in and around the lungs causing shortness of breath) became more familiar and the current concept of heart failure, which brings together swelling and shortage of breath due to fluid retention, began to be accepted, in the 17th and especially in the 18th century: Richard Lower linked dyspnea and foot swelling in 1679, and Giovanni Maria Lancisi connected jugular vein distention with right ventricular failure in 1728. Dropsy attributable to other causes, e.g. kidney failure, was differentiated in the 19th century. The stethoscope, invented by René Laennec in 1819, x-rays, discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895, and electrocardiography, described by Willem Einthoven in 1903, facilitated the investigation of heart failure.

The 19th century also saw experimental and conceptual advances in the physiology of heart contraction, which led to the formulation of the Frank-Starling law of the heart (named after physiologists Otto Frank and Ernest Starling), a remarkable advance in understanding mechanisms of heart failure.

One of the earliest treatments of heart failure, relief of swelling by bloodletting with various methods, including leeches, continued through the centuries. Along with bloodletting, Jean-Baptiste de Sénac in 1749 recommended opiates for acute shortage of breath due to heart failure. In 1785, William Withering described the therapeutic uses of the foxglove genus of plants in the treatment of edema; their extract contains cardiac glycosides, including digoxin, still used today in the treatment of heart failure. The diuretic effects of inorganic mercury salts, which were used to treat syphilis, had already been noted in the 16th century by Paracelsus; in the 19th century they were used by noted physicians like John Blackall and William Stokes. In the meantime, cannulae (tubes) invented by English physician Reginald Southey in 1877 was another method of removing excess fluid by directly inserting into swollen limbs.

Use of organic mercury compounds as diuretics, beyond their role in syphilis treatment, started in 1920, though it was limited by their parenteral route of administration and their side-effects. Oral mercurial diuretics were introduced in the 1950s; so were thiazide diuretics, which caused less toxicity, and are still used. Around the same time, the invention of echocardiography by Inge Edler and Hellmuth Hertz in 1954 marked a new era in the evaluation of heart failure. In the 1960s, loop diuretics were added to available treatments of fluid retention, while a patient with heart failure received the first heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard. Over the following decades, new drug classes found their place in heart failure therapeutics, including vasodilators like hydralazine; renin-angiotensin system inhibitors; and beta-blockers.

==Economics==

In 2011, nonhypertensive heart failure was one of the 10 most expensive conditions seen during inpatient hospitalizations in the U.S., with aggregate inpatient hospital costs more than $10.5 billion.

Heart failure is associated with a high health expenditure, mostly because of the cost of hospitalizations; costs have been estimated to amount to 2% of the total budget of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, and more than $35 billion in the United States.

==Research directions==

Some research indicates that stem cell therapy may help. Although this research indicated benefits of stem cell therapy, other research does not indicate benefit. There is tentative evidence of longer life expectancy and improved left ventricular ejection fraction in persons treated with bone marrow-derived stem cells.

The maintenance of heart function depends on appropriate gene expression that is regulated at multiple levels by epignetic mechanisms including DNA methylation and histone post-translational modification. Currently, an increasing body of research is directed at understanding the role of perturbations of epigenetic processes in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrotic scarring.

<text>A closed platform, walled garden, or closed ecosystem is a software system wherein the carrier or service provider has control over applications, content, and/or media, and restricts convenient access to non-approved applicants or content. This is in contrast to an open platform, wherein consumers generally have unrestricted access to applications and content.

==Overview==
For example, in telecommunications, the services and applications accessible on a cell phone on any given wireless device were formerly tightly controlled by the mobile operators. The operators limited the applications and developers that were available on users&#x27; home portals and home pages. Thus, a service provider might restrict user access to users whose account exhausted the pre-paid money on their account. This has long been a central issue constraining the telecommunications sector, as developers face huge hurdles in making their applications available to end-users.

In a more extreme example, the regulated 1970s American telephone system, Bell, owned all the hardware (including all phones) and had indirect control over the information sent through their infrastructure. It was an open government-sanctioned natural monopoly regulated by the Communications Act of 1934. However, in the landmark case &quot;Hush-A-Phone v. United States&quot;, Bell unsuccessfully sued a company producing plastic telephone attachments.

More generally, a walled garden can refer to a closed or exclusive set of information services provided for users. Similar to a real walled garden, a user is unable to escape this closed environment except through the designated entry/exit points or if the walls are removed.

== Aspects ==
A 2008 Harvard Business School working paper, entitled &quot;Opening Platforms: How, When and Why?&quot;, differentiated a platform&#x27;s openness/closedness by four aspects and gave example platforms:
== Examples ==
Some examples of walled gardens include:
* In the 1990s, AOL developed what later was called its &quot;walled garden&quot; model of service. The idea was to preferentially offer sponsored content to users when possible. During this period, CBS paid to provide sports content, ABC paid to provide news, and 1-800-Flowers paid to be the default florist for anyone seeking one. This strategy became AOL&#x27;s first good method for selling advertisements. In its time, this method was highly profitable to AOL.
* Amazon&#x27;s Kindle line of eReaders. As an October 2011 &quot;Business Insider&quot; article, entitled &quot;How Amazon Makes Money From The Kindle&quot; observes: &quot;Amazon&#x27;s Kindle is no longer just a product: It&#x27;s a whole ecosystem.&quot; Moreover, as &quot;Business Insider&quot; noted &quot;The Kindle ecosystem is also Amazon&#x27;s fastest-growing product and could account for more than 10% of the company&#x27;s revenue next year.&quot;
* Apple iOS and other mobile devices, which are restricted to running pre-approved applications from a digital distribution service.
* Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s Nook devices. In late December 2011, B&amp;N began pushing the automatic, over-the-air firmware update 1.4.1 to Nook Tablets that removed users&#x27; ability to gain root access to the device and the ability to sideload applications from sources other than the official Barnes and Noble NOOK Store (without modding). Nook HD devices were similarly &quot;closed&quot;, until May 2013, when BN opened its ecosystem somewhat by permitting users to install the Google Play Store and the various Android apps offered there, including those of rivals, such as Audible.com, ComiXology, Kindle, Kobo, and Google itself.
* The Encrypted Media Extensions specification provides APIs to control playback of encrypted content. This is part of the World Wide Web Consortium&#x27;s web standards and was authored by members working from Google, Microsoft and Netflix.
* Kwangmyong, the national intranet service that operates in North Korea. It operates as a &quot;walled garden&quot; network, as no information from overseas is permitted to enter the network without government approval.
* Verizon Wireless&#x27; CDMA network and policies effectively prohibiting activation of non-Verizon sanctioned devices on their network. Verizon Wireless is frequently noted (and often criticized) for this practice.
* Permissioned blockchains have been called the “walled gardens” of 2017.
* Video game consoles have a long history of walled gardens, with developers needing to purchase licences to develop for the platform, and, in some cases, needing editorial approval from the console manufacturer prior to publishing games.
* Super-apps such as WeChat, X, and Telegram have been called walled gardens by critics.

<text>Coxsackie B4 virus are enteroviruses that belong to the &quot;Picornaviridae&quot; family. These viruses can be found worldwide. They are positive-sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA viruses with icosahedral geometry. Coxsackieviruses have two groups, A and B, each associated with different diseases. Coxsackievirus group A is known for causing hand-foot-and-mouth diseases while Group B, which contains six serotypes, can cause a varying range of symptoms like gastrointestinal distress myocarditis. Coxsackievirus B4 has a cell tropism for natural killer cells and pancreatic islet cells. Infection can lead to beta cell apoptosis which increases the risk of insulitis.

==Viral structure and genome==
Coxsackievirus B4 is one of the six serotypes found in Group B and is a positive sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus. Its genome is linear and is 7,293 nucleotides in length with both a 5’ and 3’ untranslated region and encodes its own 3’ poly-A tail. The 5’ untranslated region contains an internal ribosomal entry site (Type I IRES). Covalently bonded to the 5’ UTR is the viral protein VPg which aids in viral entry and replication. 2A and 3C are viral proteinases which aid in the cleavage of the polyprotein encoded for by the genome. 3D is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). 2B, 2C, and 3A are core viral proteins. The genome also codes for 4 capsid proteins, VP4, VP1, VP2, and VP3 that form an icosahedral capsid for the viral particles that is about 30 nm. VP1-VP3 are responsible for the outer surface of the virion, while VP4 is imbedded within the capsid. 
Altogether, the polyprotein encoded for by the coxsackievirus genome is almost 2,200 amino acids in length, and is eventually cleaved by the 2A and 3C proteinases as well as by host cell proteinases.

As Coxsackievirus B4, and all other members of the picornavirus family, are non-enveloped, they are notably resilient to disinfectants, solvents, low pH levels (i.e. stomach acid), low temperatures, and 70% alcohol.

==Viral replication==

===Attachment, entry and uncoating===
The capsid of Coxsackie viruses have a distinguishable depression around the fivefold axis, termed the “canyon.” The canyon is thought to help with viral attachment through the interaction with cell surface molecules. (Riabi, 2014) When VP1 binds to the Coxsackie-Adenovirus receptor (CAR), which can be found on heart muscle cells as well as epithelial and endothelial cells, a conformational change causes the host cell receptors to form a pore in the plasma membrane through which the VPg-linked viral genome could enter the cell. Uncoating is unnecessary as it leaves the capsid at the plasma membrane and the genome is simply injected into the cytoplasm.

===Replication===
For positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, translation occurs before transcription. Upon entry of the genome into the cytoplasm of the host cell, the IRES in the 5’ UTR recruits ribosomal subunits (cap-independent mechanism) which starts the translation process. Once the polypeptide is completely translated, viral proteinases 2A and 3C, as well as cellular proteinases, cleave the polyprotein into individual proteins that will help continue the viral replication process.
As soon as viral proteins have been translated and cleaved, negative sense transcripts of the viral genome are made to serve as a template for more positive-sense viral genome transcripts (which also serves as mRNA which can also be translated into more viral proteins). The viral genome encodes for a poly-A tail, which can be recognized by cellular initiation factors and ribosomal subunits which kick starts the transcription process to make the negative-sense strand, forming a double-stranded RNA intermediate

Upon transcription of the negative sense RNA, it needs to get primed in order to start making more positive sense RNA genome. The VPg protein that is covalently linked to the 5’ end of the RNA genome has 2 U’s attached to it. The purpose of these U’s is to modify the VPg protein which serves as a protein primer which the viral RdRP can recognize and start forming more genome from the negative-sense.

The viral protein 2C brings positive sense RNA genomes to the endoplasmic reticulum where assembly and maturation will occur.

While all of this is occurring, viral proteinases are working to turn off host cell protein synthesis by cleaving the eIF-4 initiation factor. This process accomplishes the inhibition of ribosomes binding to host cell mRNAs. This effectively shuts down cap-dependent translation in the host cell.

===Assembly, maturation and egress===
Once viral genome and viral proteins reach high enough concentrations within the host cell, structural proteins must assemble. The final step in maturation of the virus is when VP0, a precursor protein, is cleaved into VP2 and VP4. Viral capsid proteins come together to form pentamers, 12 of which come together to form an empty capsid, or procapsid (Expasy, Hunt, 2010).
As mentioned before, the viral protein 2C brings CB4 viral genome to the endoplasmic reticulum where vesicle formation begins. The ER membrane moves to surround the genome and proteins, at which point the procapsid attaches to the exterior of the vesicle and encapsidates the genome and proteins. It is at this point that VP0 gets cleaved by a cellular proteinase and the virus finally becomes fully mature and infectious. Since CB4 is a non-enveloped virus, it accomplishes egress through cytolysis, breaking through the plasma membrane in order to move on to infect other cells in the host (Hunt, 2010)

==Symptoms==
Coxsackie B 1–4 viruses are typically the most severe and fatal neonatal diseases. Common symptoms can include myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, and hepatitis. Other less severe symptoms can include pneumonia, Gastrointestinal symptoms, pancreatitis, and seizures. Patients with Coxsackie B4 virus have seemed to have herpangina, tonsillitis, and pharyngitis.

CB4 virus has caused transplacental infections in mice. Infection in the first couple weeks of gestation has been shown to be harmful for dams as well as the fetus, causing reduced litter sizes, abortion, or stillbirth. Pups that were born from dams infected on days 4 and 17 of gestation had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater pancreatic abnormalities leading to symptoms similar to diabetes.

== Coxsackie B4 virus and type 1 diabetes ==
One theory proposes that type 1 diabetes is a virus-triggered autoimmune response in which the immune system attacks virus-infected cells along with the beta cells in the pancreas, but to date there is no stringent evidence to support this hypothesis in humans.

A 2004 systematic review analyzing a possible association between coxsackievirus B infection and type 1 diabetes was inconclusive. A 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis showed an association between enterovirus infections and type 1 diabetes, but in contrast, other studies have shown that rather than triggering an autoimmune process, enterovirus infections, as coxsackievirus B, could protect against onset and development of type 1 diabetes.

==Transmission to neonates==
Enteroviruses commonly infect neonates and infants younger than 12 months. Coxsackie b viruses are usually spread to infants through perinatal transmission. However, more severe cases of coxsackie B viruses are spread through transplacental transmission. Common symptoms of neonatal coxsackie B virus infection in children include meningitis and/or encephalitis. Coxsackie B4 virus is able to infect the brain and spinal cord and cause inflammation.

==Diagnosis==
Infection due to Coxsackie B viruses can be determined by measuring the amount of neutralizing antibodies in the blood, PCR, and through microscopic detection. It is difficult to diagnose CBV based on the symptoms.

<doc id="249936" wikidata="Q407786" url="?curid=249936" title="Cyclamate">
<text>Cyclamate is an artificial sweetener. It is 30–50 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), making it the least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. It is often used with other artificial sweeteners, especially saccharin; the mixture of 10 parts cyclamate to 1 part saccharin is common and masks the off-tastes of both sweeteners. It is less expensive than most sweeteners, including sucralose, and is stable under heating. Safety concerns led to it being banned in a few countries, though the European Union considers it safe.

==Chemistry==
Cyclamate is the sodium or calcium salt of cyclamic acid (cyclohexanesulfamic acid), which itself is prepared by reacting freebase cyclohexylamine with either sulfamic acid or sulfur trioxide.

Prior to 1973, Abbott Laboratories produced sodium cyclamate (Sucaryl) by a mixture of ingredients including the addition of pure sodium (flakes or rods suspended in solvent) with cyclohexylamine, chilled and filtered through a high speed centrifugal separator, dried, granulated and micro-pulverised for powder or tablet usage.

==History==

Cyclamate was discovered in 1937 at the University of Illinois by graduate student Michael Sveda. Sveda was working in the lab on the synthesis of an antipyretic drug. He put his cigarette down on the lab bench, and when he put it back in his mouth, he discovered the sweet taste of cyclamate.

The patent for cyclamate was purchased by DuPont and later sold to Abbott Laboratories, which undertook the necessary studies and submitted a New Drug Application in 1950. Abbott intended to use cyclamate to mask the bitterness of certain drugs such as antibiotics and pentobarbital. In 1958, it was designated GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Cyclamate was marketed in tablet form for use by diabetics as an alternative tabletop sweetener, as well as in a liquid form. As cyclamate is stable to heat, it was and is marketed as suitable for use in cooking and baking.

In 1966, a study reported that some intestinal bacteria could desulfonate cyclamate to produce cyclohexylamine, a compound suspected to have some chronic toxicity in animals. Further research resulted in a 1969 study that found the common 10:1 cyclamate–saccharin mixture increased the incidence of bladder cancer in rats. The released study was showing that eight out of 240 rats fed a mixture of saccharin and cyclamates, at levels equivalent to humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day, developed bladder tumors.

Sales continued to expand, and in 1969, annual sales of cyclamate had reached $1 billion, which increased pressure from public safety watchdogs to restrict the usage of cyclamate. In October 1969, Department of Health, Education &amp; Welfare Secretary Robert Finch, bypassing Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Herbert L. Ley, Jr., removed the GRAS designation from cyclamate and banned its use in general-purpose foods, though it remained available for restricted use in dietary products with additional labeling; in October 1970, the FDA, under a new commissioner, banned cyclamate completely from all food and drug products in the United States.

Abbott Laboratories claimed that its own studies were unable to reproduce the 1969 study&#x27;s results, and, in 1973, Abbott petitioned the FDA to lift the ban on cyclamate. This petition was eventually denied in 1980 by FDA Commissioner Jere Goyan. Abbott Labs, together with the Calorie Control Council (a political lobby representing the diet foods industry), filed a second petition in 1982. Although the FDA has stated that a review of all available evidence does not implicate cyclamate as a carcinogen in mice or rats, cyclamate remains banned from food products in the United States. The petition is now held in abeyance, though not actively considered. It is unclear whether this is at the request of Abbott Labs or because the petition is considered to be insufficient by the FDA.

In 2000, a paper was published describing the results of a 24-year-long experiment in which 16 monkeys were fed a normal diet and 21 monkeys were fed either 100 or 500 mg/kg cyclamate per day; the higher dose corresponds to about 30 cans of a diet beverage. Two of the high-dosed monkeys and one of the lower-dosed monkeys were found to have malignant cancer, each with a different kind of cancer, and three benign tumors were found. The authors concluded that the study failed to demonstrate that cyclamate was carcinogenic because the cancers were all different and there was no way to link cyclamate to each of them. The substance did not show any DNA-damaging properties in DNA repair assays.

== Legal status ==

Cyclamate is approved as a sweetener in at least 130 countries. In the late 1960s, cyclamate was banned in the United Kingdom; however, it was approved after being re-evaluated by the European Union in 1996.

In the Philippines, cyclamate was banned until the Philippine Food and Drug Administration lifted the ban in 2013, declaring it safe for consumption. Cyclamate remains banned in the United States, South Korea, and Bangladesh.

<text>San Juan Hill is a series of hills to the east of Santiago, Cuba, running north to south. It is located in the province of Santiago de Cuba, in the southeastern part of the country, 800 km east of Havana, the capital of the country. San Juan Hill is located 633 meters above sea level.

The area is known as the San Juan Heights or in Spanish Alturas de San Juan before the Spanish–American War of 1898, and are now part of Lomas de San Juan.

==Overview==
This area was the site of the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish–American War. The Americans named the lesser heights &quot;Kettle Hill&quot; and the higher southern hill &quot;San Juan Hill&quot; after the battle of July 2, 1898. The two high points or hills are connected by a draw or saddle on a north–south axis.

The fight for the San Juan Heights or Hills became known as the Battle of San Juan &quot;Hill&quot; due to a reporter&#x27;s telegraphy error in which the plural &quot;s&quot; was dropped. American Army reports also referred to the heights as &quot;hills&quot;.

<text>Glucagon is a peptide hormone, produced by alpha cells of the pancreas. It raises the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream and is considered to be the main catabolic hormone of the body. It is also used as a medication to treat a number of health conditions. Its effect is opposite to that of insulin, which lowers extracellular glucose. It is produced from proglucagon, encoded by the &quot;GCG&quot; gene.

The pancreas releases glucagon when the amount of glucose in the bloodstream is too low. Glucagon causes the liver to engage in glycogenolysis: converting stored glycogen into glucose, which is released into the bloodstream. High blood-glucose levels, on the other hand, stimulate the release of insulin. Insulin allows glucose to be taken up and used by insulin-dependent tissues. Thus, glucagon and insulin are part of a feedback system that keeps blood glucose levels stable. Glucagon increases energy expenditure and is elevated under conditions of stress. Glucagon belongs to the secretin family of hormones.

== Structure ==
Glucagon is a 29-amino acid polypeptide. Its primary structure in humans is: NH2-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH (HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNT).

The polypeptide has a molecular mass of 3485 daltons. Glucagon is a peptide (nonsteroid) hormone.

== Physiology ==

=== Production ===

The hormone is synthesized and secreted from alpha cells (α-cells) of the islets of Langerhans, which are located in the endocrine portion of the pancreas. Glucagon is produced from the preproglucagon gene &quot;Gcg&quot;. Preproglucagon first has its signal peptide removed by signal peptidase, forming the 160-amino acid protein proglucagon. Proglucagon is then cleaved by proprotein convertase 2 to glucagon (amino acids 33-61) in pancreatic islet α cells. In intestinal L cells, proglucagon is cleaved to the alternate products glicentin (1–69), glicentin-related pancreatic polypeptide (1–30), oxyntomodulin (33–69), glucagon-like peptide 1 (72–107 or 108), and glucagon-like peptide 2 (126–158).

In rodents, the alpha cells are located in the outer rim of the islet. Human islet structure is much less segregated, and alpha cells are distributed throughout the islet in close proximity to beta cells. Glucagon is also produced by alpha cells in the stomach.

Recent research has demonstrated that glucagon production may also take place outside the pancreas, with the gut being the most likely site of extrapancreatic glucagon synthesis.

=== Regulation ===
Production, which is otherwise freerunning, is suppressed/regulated by amylin, a peptide hormone co-secreted with insulin from the pancreatic β cells. As plasma glucose levels recede, the subsequent reduction in amylin secretion alleviates its suppression of the α cells, allowing for glucagon secretion.

Secretion of glucagon is stimulated by:
* Hypoglycemia
* Epinephrine (via β2, α2, and α1 adrenergic receptors)
* Arginine
* Alanine (often from muscle-derived pyruvate/glutamate transamination (see alanine transaminase reaction).
* Acetylcholine
* Cholecystokinin
* Gastric inhibitory polypeptide
* Gastrin

Secretion of glucagon is inhibited by:
* Somatostatin
* Amylin
* Insulin (via GABA)
* PPARγ/retinoid X receptor heterodimer.
* Increased free fatty acids and keto acids into the blood.
* Increased urea production
* Glucagon-like peptide-1

==Function==
Glucagon generally elevates the concentration of glucose in the blood by promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Glucagon also decreases fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue and the liver, as well as promoting lipolysis in these tissues, which causes them to release fatty acids into circulation where they can be catabolised to generate energy in tissues such as skeletal muscle when required.

Glucose is stored in the liver in the form of the polysaccharide glycogen, which is a glucan (a polymer made up of glucose molecules). Liver cells (hepatocytes) have glucagon receptors. When glucagon binds to the glucagon receptors, the liver cells convert the glycogen into individual glucose molecules and release them into the bloodstream, in a process known as glycogenolysis. As these stores become depleted, glucagon then encourages the liver and kidney to synthesize additional glucose by gluconeogenesis. Glucagon turns off glycolysis in the liver, causing glycolytic intermediates to be shuttled to gluconeogenesis.

Glucagon also regulates the rate of glucose production through lipolysis. Glucagon induces lipolysis in humans under conditions of insulin suppression (such as diabetes mellitus type 1).

Glucagon production appears to be dependent on the central nervous system through pathways yet to be defined. In invertebrate animals, eyestalk removal has been reported to affect glucagon production. Excising the eyestalk in young crayfish produces glucagon-induced hyperglycemia.

== Mechanism of action ==

Glucagon binds to the glucagon receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, located in the plasma membrane of the cell. The conformation change in the receptor activates a G protein, a heterotrimeric protein with αs, β, and γ subunits. When the G protein interacts with the receptor, it undergoes a conformational change that results in the replacement of the GDP molecule that was bound to the α subunit with a GTP molecule. This substitution results in the releasing of the α subunit from the β and γ subunits. The alpha subunit specifically activates the next enzyme in the cascade, adenylate cyclase.

Adenylate cyclase manufactures cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP or cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase). This enzyme, in turn, activates phosphorylase kinase, which then phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase b (PYG b), converting it into the active form called phosphorylase a (PYG a). Phosphorylase a is the enzyme responsible for the release of glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen polymers. An example of the pathway would be when glucagon binds to a transmembrane protein. The transmembrane proteins interacts with Gɑβ𝛾. Gαs separates from Gβ𝛾 and interacts with the transmembrane protein adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP binds to protein kinase A, and the complex phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase kinase. Phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase. Phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase clips glucose units from glycogen as glucose 1-phosphate. 

Additionally, the coordinated control of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver is adjusted by the phosphorylation state of the enzymes that catalyze the formation of a potent activator of glycolysis called fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme protein kinase A (PKA) that was stimulated by the cascade initiated by glucagon will also phosphorylate a single serine residue of the bifunctional polypeptide chain containing both the enzymes fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase and phosphofructokinase-2. This covalent phosphorylation initiated by glucagon activates the former and inhibits the latter. This regulates the reaction catalyzing fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1, the enzyme that is the primary regulatory step of glycolysis) by slowing the rate of its formation, thereby inhibiting the flux of the glycolysis pathway and allowing gluconeogenesis to predominate. This process is reversible in the absence of glucagon (and thus, the presence of insulin).

Glucagon stimulation of PKA inactivates the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, inactivates glycogen synthase, and activates hormone-sensitive lipase, which catabolizes glycerides into glycerol and free fatty acid(s), in hepatocytes.

Glucagon also inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which creates malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, through cAMP-dependent and/or cAMP-independent kinases.

Malonyl-CoA is a product formed by ACC during denovo synthesis and an allosteric inhibitor of Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), a mitochondrial enzyme important for bringing fatty acids into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria for β-oxidation. Glucagon decreases malonyl-CoA through inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and through reduced glycolysis through its aforementioned reduction in Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Thus, reduction in malonyl-CoA is a common regulator for the increased fatty acid metabolism effects of glucagon.

== Pathology ==
Abnormally elevated levels of glucagon may be caused by pancreatic tumors, such as glucagonoma, symptoms of which include necrolytic migratory erythema, reduced amino acids, and hyperglycemia. It may occur alone or in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

Elevated glucagon is the main contributor to hyperglycemic ketoacidosis in undiagnosed or poorly treated type 1 diabetes. As the beta cells cease to function, insulin and pancreatic GABA are no longer present to suppress the freerunning output of glucagon. As a result, glucagon is released from the alpha cells at a maximum, causing a rapid breakdown of glycogen to glucose and fast ketogenesis . It was found that a subset of adults with type 1 diabetes took 4 times longer on average to approach ketoacidosis when given somatostatin (inhibits glucagon production) with no insulin. Inhibiting glucagon has been a popular idea of diabetes treatment, however, some have warned that doing so will give rise to brittle diabetes in patients with adequately stable blood glucose.

The absence of alpha cells (and hence glucagon) is thought to be one of the main influences in the extreme volatility of blood glucose in the setting of a total pancreatectomy.

== History ==
In the early 1920s, several groups noted that pancreatic extracts injected into diabetic animals would result in a brief increase in blood sugar prior to the insulin-driven decrease in blood sugar. In 1922, C. Kimball and John R. Murlin identified a component of pancreatic extracts responsible for this blood sugar increase, terming it &quot;glucagon&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;glucose agonist&quot;. In the 1950s, scientists at Eli Lilly isolated pure glucagon, crystallized it, and determined its amino acid sequence. This led to the development of the first radioimmunoassay for detecting glucagon, described by Roger Unger&#x27;s group in 1959.

A more complete understanding of its role in physiology and disease was not established until the 1970s, when a specific radioimmunoassay was developed.

In 1979, while working in Joel Habener&#x27;s laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, Richard Goodman collected islet cells from Brockman bodies of American anglerfish in order to investigate somatostatin. By splicing DNA from anglerfish islet cells into bacteria, Goodman was able to identify the gene which codes for somatostatin. P. Kay Lund joined the Habener lab and used Goodman&#x27;s bacteria to search for the gene for glucagon. In 1982, Lund and Goodman published their discovery that the proglucagon gene codes for three distinct peptides: glucagon and two novel peptides. Graeme Bell at Chiron Corporation led a team which isolated the two latter peptides, which are now known as glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2. This opened the door to the discovery of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor and then drugs which target that receptor, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists.

<text>Rabbit-Proof Fence is a 2002 Australian epic drama film directed and produced by Phillip Noyce. It was based on the 1996 book &quot;Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; by Doris Pilkington Garimara, an Aboriginal Australian author. It is loosely based on the author&#x27;s mother Molly Craig, aunt Daisy Kadibil, and cousin Gracie, who escaped from the Moore River Native Settlement, north of Perth, Western Australia, to return to their Aboriginal families. They had been removed from their families and placed there in 1931.

The film follows the Aboriginal girls as they walk for nine weeks along of the Australian rabbit-proof fence to return to their community at Jigalong. They were pursued by white law enforcement officials and an Aboriginal tracker. The film explores the official child removal policy that existed in Australia between approximately 1905 and 1967. Its victims, who were taken from their families, now are called the &quot;Stolen Generations&quot;.

The soundtrack to the film, called &quot;Long Walk Home: Music from the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot;, is by English singer and songwriter Peter Gabriel. British producer Jeremy Thomas, who has a long connection with Australia, was executive producer of the film. He sold it internationally through his company HanWay Films. In 2005 the British Film Institute included this film in the BFI list of the &quot;50 films one should see by the age of 14.&quot;

==Plot==
In 1931, two sisters14-year-old Molly and 8-year-old Daisyand their 10-year-old cousin Gracie are living in the Western Australian town of Jigalong. The town lies along the northern part of one of the fences making up Australia&#x27;s rabbit-proof fence (called Number One Fence), which runs for over one thousand miles.

More than a thousand miles away in Perth, the official Protector of Western Australian Aborigines, A. O. Neville (called Mr. Devil by them), signs an order to relocate the three girls to the Moore River Native Settlement. The children are referred to by Neville as &quot;half-castes&quot;, because they each have Aboriginal mothers and white fathers. Neville had concluded that the Aboriginal people of Australia were a danger to themselves, and the &quot;half-castes&quot; must be bred out of existence. He plans to place the girls in a camp where they, along with all half-castes of that age range, both boys and girls, will grow up.

They would be trained to work as labourers and servants to white families, which were regarded as &quot;good&quot; situations for them in life. It was assumed that they would marry whites, and so on through the generations, so that eventually the Aboriginal &quot;blood&quot; would diminish in society.

The three girls are forcibly taken from their families at Jigalong by a local constable, Riggs. They were sent to the camp at the Moore River Native Settlement, in the south west, about 90 km (55 miles) north of Perth.

While at the camp, the girls are housed in a large dormitory with dozens of other children, where they are strictly regimented by nuns. They are prohibited from speaking their native language, forced to pray as Christians, and subject to corporal punishment for any infractions of the camp&#x27;s rules. Attempts at escape are also harshly punished, as seen in the film, where an escapee is beaten and has their hair cut off. During an impending thunderstorm that will help cover their tracks, Molly convinces the girls to escape and return to their home.

During their flight, the girls are relentlessly pursued by Moodoo, 
an Aboriginal tracker from the camp. They eventually find their way back to the rabbit-proof fence, which they believe will lead them back to their home. They follow the fence for months, encountering a family who gives them clothes and food, as well as a camper who shows them a shortcut, which allows them to narrowly avoid Moodoo and Neville&#x27;s agents. They also encounter a maid, who lets them stay at her room for a night, but they are discovered by her husband, who is implied to be abusing her. After another narrow escape, Neville spreads word that Gracie&#x27;s mother is waiting for her in the town of Wiluna. The information finds its way to an Aboriginal traveller who &quot;helps&quot; the girls.

He tells Gracie about her mother and says they can get to Wiluna by train, causing her to leave the other two girls in an attempt to catch a train to Wiluna. Molly and Daisy soon walk after her and find her at a train station. They are not reunited, however, as Riggs appears and Gracie is recaptured. The betrayal is revealed by Riggs, who tells the man he will receive a shilling for his help.

Knowing they are powerless to aid her, Molly and Daisy continue their journey. They lose the fence for a while travelling through a harsh desert, but Molly is eventually guided back by an eagle. In the end, after a nine-week journey through the harsh Australian outback, having walked the route along the fence, the two sisters return home and go into hiding in the desert with their mother and grandmother. Meanwhile, Neville realizes he can no longer afford the search for Molly and Daisy, and decides to end it.

===Epilogue===
The film&#x27;s epilogue shows recent footage of Molly and Daisy. Molly explains that Gracie died before she could ever return to Jigalong. Molly says that she had two daughters. She and they were taken from Jigalong back to Moore River. She managed to escape with one daughter, her young Annabelle. She carried the girl much of the way along the length of the fence back home. However, when Annabelle was three years old, she was taken away once more. Molly never saw her again. In closing, Molly says that she and Daisy &quot;... are never going back to that place&quot;.

==Production==
The film is adapted from the book &quot;Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot;, by Doris Pilkington Garimara, an Aboriginal Australian. It is the second book of her trilogy documenting her family&#x27;s stories. The other two books are &quot;Caprice: A Stockman’s Daughter&quot; (1991) and &quot;Under the Wintamarra Tree&quot; (2002).

Stills photographs in the film were made by well-known Aboriginal Australian photographer Mervyn Bishop. His work is held at the National Portrait Gallery of Australia.

==Reception==

===Public reception===
The film stirred controversy in Australia relating to the government&#x27;s historical policy of removing mixed-race Aboriginal children from their families in Aboriginal communities and placing them in state institutions. They became known as the Stolen Generations.

Eric Abetz, a government minister, announced the publication of a leaflet criticising the film&#x27;s portrayal of the treatment of Indigenous Australians, and demanded an apology from the filmmakers. Director Phillip Noyce suggested that instead the government should apologise to the numerous Indigenous people affected by the removal policy.

Conservative commentators, such as Andrew Bolt, also attacked the historical accuracy of the film. Bolt criticised the numerous disparities between the film and Pilkington Garimara&#x27;s novel. This angered the author, who said that Bolt had misquoted her. The academic Robert Manne in turn accused Bolt of historical denialism. Screenwriter Christine Olsen wrote a detailed response to Bolt&#x27;s claims.

Olsen attributed the angry response among some of the public to the fact that it was based in events that were &quot;demonstrably true&quot; and well-documented. However, the filmmaker said that the film was meant primarily as a drama rather than a political or historical statement. Noyce said, &quot;If drama comes from conflict, there&#x27;s no greater conflict in Australian history than the conflict between Indigenous Australians and white settlers.&quot;

The historian Keith Windschuttle also disputed the film&#x27;s depiction of events. In his work &quot;The Fabrication of Aboriginal History&quot;, he wrote that Molly and the two other girls had been removed for their own welfare, and that the two older girls had been sexually involved with white men. Noyce and Olsen rejected these criticisms, stating that Windschuttle&#x27;s research was incomplete. Pilkington Garimara denied Windschuttle&#x27;s claims of sexual activity between her mother and local whites, stating that the claims were a distortion of history.

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s score is 88% based on 145 reviews. The site&#x27;s Critics&#x27; Consensus states, &quot;Visually beautiful and well-acted, &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; tells a compelling true-life story&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 80 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.
David Stratton of SBS awarded the film four stars out of five, commenting that &quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; is a &quot;bold and timely film about the stolen generations.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; grossed $16.2 million worldwide, including $3.8 million in Australia.

<text>&quot;Kassaman&quot;, or &quot;Qassaman&quot; (, &quot;we pledge&quot;, &quot;the oath&quot; or &quot;we swear&quot;), is the national anthem of Algeria. Moufdi Zakaria authored the lyrics, while the music was composed by Egyptian composer Mohamed Fawzi. The song was adopted as the national anthem in 1962, when the country gained independence from France.

==History==
The French invaded Ottoman Algeria in 1830 and made it an integral part of Metropolitan France within its colonial empire. For the next century, the native population were given very few political rights. Consequently, a nationalist movement began in the 1920s and gained traction after World War II, when a commitment by the government to grant French Algeria autonomy failed to materialize. A prominent member of this movement was Moufdi Zakaria, a Mozabite Berber poet affiliated with the Algerian People&#x27;s Party (PPA). He was jailed and tortured on several occasions between the 1920s and 1962. It was during one of these experiences, in April 1955, that he penned the words to &quot;Kassaman&quot;. Since he did not have access to paper or writing instruments while incarcerated in Barberousse Prison, Zakaria reportedly wrote the lyrics with his own blood on the walls of his jail cell. The musical portion of the anthem was subsequently composed by Mohamed Fawzi, who was asked to undertake this effort after two earlier submissions by other composers – one of which was by – were rejected.

Both the lyrics and music were officially adopted in 1962; in that same year, the Évian Accords were signed, paving the way for a referendum in which Algerians overwhelmingly voted in favour of independence, which was duly granted. Although &quot;Kassaman&quot; was only intended to be a provisional national anthem, it has endured to this day.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;Kassaman&quot; are reflective of a war song, This is because it promotes nationalistic ideals and principles on the front line, glorifies the actions of the National Liberation Front (FLN), as well as espousing armed uprising and how it is the sole route to attaining independence. It is also noteworthy in that it alludes to another country – France – specifically concerning the violent struggle against them for independence. The song foreshadows how &quot;the day of reckoning&quot; will befall Algeria&#x27;s former colonial ruler.

Usually only the first verse of the anthem is performed for brevity, such as during sporting events. However, per decree of Algerian President Abdelmajjid Tebboune, all stanzas of the anthem, including the third stanza (referring to France), must be performed at any events attended by the President of the Republic, including (but not limited to) welcome ceremonies for visiting Heads of State, presidential inaugurations, and FLN Congresses.

==Legal protection==
Even though &quot;Kassaman&quot; was adopted in 1962, it was not until November of 2008 that an amendment to Article 5 of the Constitution of Algeria was made declaring it as &quot;immutable&quot;, given its association with the country&#x27;s revolution. It also confirmed that the national anthem comprises all of the song&#x27;s verses, thus ending the deliberation over whether it was still appropriate to include the unfavourable reference to France in the present day.

<text>Immunosuppressive drugs, also known as immunosuppressive agents, immunosuppressants and antirejection medications, are drugs that inhibit or prevent the activity of the immune system.

==Classification==
Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified into five groups:
* glucocorticoids
* cytostatics
* antibodies
* drugs acting on immunophilins
* other drugs

===Glucocorticoids===

In pharmacologic (supraphysiologic) doses, glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone are used to suppress various allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. They are also administered as posttransplantory immunosuppressants to prevent the acute transplant rejection and graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, they do not prevent an infection and also inhibit later reparative processes.

====Immunosuppressive mechanism====
Glucocorticoids suppress cell-mediated immunity. They act by inhibiting gene expression of cytokines including Interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha by binding to corticosteroid response elements on DNA. This decrease in cytokine production reduces T cell proliferation. With decreased T cell proliferation there is decreased production of IL-2. This further decreases the proliferation of T cells.

Glucocorticoids also suppress the humoral immunity, causing B cells to express smaller amounts of IL-2 and IL-2 receptors. This diminishes both B cell clone expansion and antibody synthesis.

====Anti-inflammatory effects====
Glucocorticoids influence all types of inflammatory events, no matter their cause. They induce the lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect.

Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines, etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages, and mastocytes.

===Cytostatics===

Cytostatics inhibit cell division. In immunotherapy, they are used in smaller doses than in the treatment of malignant diseases. They affect the proliferation of both T cells and B cells. Due to their highest effectiveness, purine analogs are most frequently administered.

====Alkylating agents====

The alkylating agents used in immunotherapy are nitrogen mustards (cyclophosphamide), nitrosoureas, platinum compounds, and others. Cyclophosphamide (Baxter&#x27;s Cytoxan) is probably the most potent immunosuppressive compound. In small doses, it is very efficient in the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemias, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and other immune diseases. High doses cause pancytopenia and hemorrhagic cystitis.

====Antimetabolites====

Antimetabolites interfere with the synthesis of nucleic acids. These include:
* folic acid analogues, such as methotrexate
* purine analogues, such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine
* pyrimidine analogues, such as fluorouracil
* protein synthesis inhibitors.

=====Methotrexate=====

Methotrexate is a folic acid analogue. It binds dihydrofolate reductase and prevents synthesis of tetrahydrofolate. It is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (for example rheumatoid arthritis or Behcet&#x27;s Disease) and in transplantations.

=====Azathioprine and mercaptopurine=====

Azathioprine (Prometheus&#x27; Imuran), is the main immunosuppressive cytotoxic substance. It is extensively used to control transplant rejection reactions. It is nonenzymatically cleaved to mercaptopurine, that acts as a purine analogue and an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. Mercaptopurine itself can also be administered directly.

By preventing the clonal expansion of lymphocytes in the induction phase of the immune response, it affects both the cell and the humoral immunity. It is also efficient in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

=====Cytotoxic antibiotics=====
Among these, dactinomycin is the most important. It is used in kidney transplantations. Other cytotoxic antibiotics are anthracyclines, mitomycin C, bleomycin, mithramycin.

===Antibodies===

Antibodies are sometimes used as a quick and potent immunosuppressive therapy to prevent the acute rejection reactions as well as a targeted treatment of lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorders (e.g., anti-CD20 monoclonals).

====Polyclonal antibodies====
Heterologous polyclonal antibodies are obtained from the serum of animals (e.g., rabbit, horse), and injected with the patient&#x27;s thymocytes or lymphocytes. The antilymphocyte (ALG) and antithymocyte antigens (ATG) are being used. They are part of the steroid-resistant acute rejection reaction and grave aplastic anemia treatment. However, they are added primarily to other immunosuppressives to diminish their dosage and toxicity. They also allow transition to cyclosporin therapy.

Polyclonal antibodies inhibit T lymphocytes and cause their lysis, which is both complement-mediated cytolysis and cell-mediated opsonization followed by removal of reticuloendothelial cells from the circulation in the spleen and liver. In this way, polyclonal antibodies inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions, including graft rejection, delayed hypersensitivity (i.e., tuberculin skin reaction), and the graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but influence thymus-dependent antibody production.

As of March 2005, there are two preparations available to the market: Atgam, obtained from horse serum, and Thymoglobuline, obtained from rabbit serum. Polyclonal antibodies affect all lymphocytes and cause general immunosuppression, possibly leading to post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) or serious infections, especially by cytomegalovirus. To reduce these risks, treatment is provided in a hospital, where adequate isolation from infection is available. They are usually administered for five days intravenously in the appropriate quantity. Patients stay in the hospital as long as three weeks to give the immune system time to recover to a point where there is no longer a risk of serum sickness.

Because of a high immunogenicity of polyclonal antibodies, almost all patients have an acute reaction to the treatment. It is characterized by fever, rigor episodes, and even anaphylaxis. Later during the treatment, some patients develop serum sickness or immune complex glomerulonephritis. Serum sickness arises seven to fourteen days after the therapy has begun. The patient has fever, joint pain, and erythema that can be soothed with the use of steroids and analgesics. Urticaria (hives) can also be present. It is possible to diminish their toxicity by using highly purified serum fractions and intravenous administration in the combination with other immunosuppressants, for example, calcineurin inhibitors, cytostatics, and corticosteroids. The most frequent combination is to use antibodies and ciclosporin simultaneously in order to prevent patients from gradually developing a strong immune response to these drugs, reducing or eliminating their effectiveness.

====Monoclonal antibodies====
Monoclonal antibodies are directed towards exactly defined antigens. Therefore, they cause fewer side-effects. Especially significant are the IL-2 receptor- (CD25-) and CD3-directed antibodies. They are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, but also to track changes in the lymphocyte subpopulations. It is reasonable to expect similar new drugs in the future.

=====T-cell receptor directed antibodies=====
Muromonab-CD3 is a murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody of the IgG2a type that was previously used to prevent T-cell activation and proliferation by binding the T-cell receptor complex present on all differentiated T cells. As such it was one of the first potent immunosuppressive substances and was administered to control the steroid- and/or polyclonal antibodies-resistant acute rejection episodes. As it acts more specifically than polyclonal antibodies it was also used prophylactically in transplantations. However, muromonab-CD3 is no longer produced, and this mouse monoclonal antibody has been replaced in the clinic with chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibodies.

The muromonab&#x27;s mechanism of action is only partially understood. It is known that the molecule binds TCR/CD3 receptor complex. In the first few administrations this binding non-specifically activates T-cells, leading to a serious syndrome 30 to 60 minutes later. It is characterized by fever, myalgia, headache, and arthralgia. Sometimes it develops in a life-threatening reaction of the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system, requiring a lengthy therapy. Past this period CD3 blocks the TCR-antigen binding and causes conformational change or the removal of the entire TCR3/CD3 complex from the T-cell surface. This lowers the number of available T-cells, perhaps by sensitizing them for the uptake by the epithelial reticular cells. The cross-binding of CD3 molecules as well activates an intracellular signal causing the T cell anergy or apoptosis, unless the cells receive another signal through a co-stimulatory molecule. CD3 antibodies shift the balance from Th1 to Th2 cells as CD3 stimulates Th1 activation.

The patient may develop neutralizing antibodies reducing the effectiveness of muromonab-CD3.
Muromonab-CD3 can cause excessive immunosuppression. Although CD3 antibodies act more specifically than polyclonal antibodies, they lower the cell-mediated immunity significantly, predisposing the patient to opportunistic infections and malignancies.

=====IL-2 receptor directed antibodies=====
Interleukin-2 is an important immune system regulator necessary for the clone expansion and survival of activated lymphocytes T. Its effects are mediated by the trimer cell surface receptor IL-2a, consisting of the α, β, and γ chains. The IL-2a (CD25, T-cell activation antigen, TAC) is expressed only by the already-activated T lymphocytes. Therefore, it is of special significance to the selective immunosuppressive treatment, and research has been focused on the development of effective and safe anti-IL-2 antibodies. By the use of recombinant gene technology, the mouse anti-Tac antibodies have been modified, leading to the presentation of two chimeric mouse/human anti-Tac antibodies in the year 1998: basiliximab (Simulect) and daclizumab (Zenapax). These drugs act by binding the IL-2a receptor&#x27;s α chain, preventing the IL-2 induced clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes and shortening their survival. They are used in the prophylaxis of the acute organ rejection after bilateral kidney transplantation, both being similarly effective and with only few side-effects.

===Drugs acting on immunophilins===
====Ciclosporin====

Like tacrolimus, ciclosporin (Novartis&#x27; Sandimmune) is a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI). It has been in use since 1983 and is one of the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs. It is a cyclic fungal peptide, composed of 11 amino acids.

Ciclosporin is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (an immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T-lymphocytes. This complex of ciclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits the phosphatase calcineurin, which under normal circumstances induces the transcription of interleukin-2. The drug also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release, leading to a reduced function of effector T-cells.

Ciclosporin is used in the treatment of acute rejection reactions, but has been increasingly substituted with newer, and less nephrotoxic, immunosuppressants.

Calcineurin inhibitors and azathioprine have been linked with post-transplant malignancies and skin cancers in organ transplant recipients. Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) after kidney transplantation is common and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The results of several studies suggest that calcineurin inhibitors have oncogenic properties mainly linked to the production of cytokines that promote tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis.

This drug has been reported to reduce the frequency of regulatory T cells (T-Reg) and after converting from a CNI monotherapy to a mycophenolate monotherapy, patients were found to have increased graft success and T-Reg frequency.

====Tacrolimus====

Tacrolimus (trade names Prograf, Astagraf XL, Envarsus XR) is a product of the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces tsukubensis&quot;. It is a macrolide lactone and acts by inhibiting calcineurin.

The drug is used primarily in liver and kidney transplantations, although in some clinics it is used in heart, lung, and heart/lung transplantations. It binds to the immunophilin FKBP1A, followed by the binding of the complex to calcineurin and the inhibition of its phosphatase activity. In this way, it prevents the cell from transitioning from the G0 into G1 phase of the cell cycle. Tacrolimus is more potent than ciclosporin and has less pronounced side-effects.

====Sirolimus====

Sirolimus (rapamycin, trade name Rapamune) is a macrolide lactone, produced by the actinomycete bacterium &quot;Streptomyces hygroscopicus&quot;. It is used to prevent rejection reactions. Although it is a structural analogue of tacrolimus, it acts somewhat differently and has different side-effects.

Contrary to ciclosporin and tacrolimus, drugs that affect the first phase of T lymphocyte activation, sirolimus affects the second phase, namely signal transduction and lymphocyte clonal proliferation. It binds to FKBP1A like tacrolimus, however the complex does not inhibit calcineurin but another protein, mTOR. Therefore, sirolimus acts synergistically with ciclosporin and, in combination with other immunosuppressants, has few side effects. Also, it indirectly inhibits several T lymphocyte-specific kinases and phosphatases, hence preventing their transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. In a similar manner, Sirolimus prevents B cell differentiation into plasma cells, reducing production of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies.

It is also active against tumors that are PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent.

====Everolimus====

Everolimus is an analog of sirolimus and also is an mTOR inhibitor.

====Zotarolimus====

Zotarolimus is a semi-synthetic derivative of sirolimus used in drug-eluting stents.

===Other drugs===

====Interferons====

IFN-β suppresses the production of Th1 cytokines and the activation of monocytes. It is used to slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis. IFN-γ is able to trigger lymphocytic apoptosis.

====Opioids====
Prolonged use of opioids may cause immunosuppression of both innate and adaptive immunity. Decrease in proliferation as well as immune function has been observed in macrophages, as well as lymphocytes. It is thought that these effects are mediated by opioid receptors expressed on the surface of these immune cells.

====TNF binding proteins====
A TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) binding protein is a monoclonal antibody or a circulating receptor such as infliximab (Remicade), etanercept (Enbrel), or adalimumab (Humira) that binds to TNF-α, preventing it from inducing the synthesis of IL-1 and IL-6 and the adhesion of lymphocyte-activating molecules. They are used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and psoriasis.

These drugs may raise the risk of contracting tuberculosis or inducing a latent infection to become active. Infliximab and adalimumab have label warnings stating that patients should be evaluated for latent TB infection and treatment should be initiated prior to starting therapy with them.

TNF or the effects of TNF are also suppressed by various natural compounds, including curcumin (an ingredient in turmeric) and catechins (in green tea).

====Mycophenolate====
Mycophenolic acid acts as a non-competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is a key enzyme in the &quot;de novo&quot; guanosine nucleotide synthesis. In contrast to other human cell types, lymphocytes B and T are very dependent on this process. Mycophenolate mofetil is used in combination with ciclosporin or tacrolimus in transplant patients.

====Small biological agents====
Fingolimod is a synthetic immunosuppressant. It increases the expression or changes the function of certain adhesion molecules (α4/β7 integrin) in lymphocytes, so they accumulate in the lymphatic tissue (lymphatic nodes) and their number in the circulation is diminished. In this respect, it differs from all other known immunosuppressants.

Myriocin has been reported being 10 to 100 times more potent than Ciclosporin.

==Therapy==
Immunosuppressive drugs are used in immunosuppressive therapy to:
* Prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g., bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver)
* Treat autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, vitiligo, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, Behcet&#x27;s Disease, pemphigus, ankylosing spondylitis, and ulcerative colitis).
* Treat some other non-autoimmune inflammatory diseases (e.g., long term allergic asthma control).

==Side effects==
A common side-effect of many immunosuppressive drugs is immunodeficiency, because the majority of them act non-selectively, resulting in increased susceptibility to infections, decreased cancer immunosurveillance and decreased ability to produce antibodies after vaccination.
However, the vaccination status of patients taking immunosuppressive drugs for chronic diseases such as Rheumatoid arthritis or Inflammatory bowel disease should be investigated before starting any treatment, and patients should eventually be vaccinated against Vaccine-preventable disease. Some studies showed a low vaccination rate against some Vaccine-preventable disease among patients taking immunosuppressive drugs, despite a generally positive attitude towards vaccinations.

There are also other side-effects, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, peptic ulcers, lipodystrophy, moon face, liver injury and kidney injury. The immunosuppressive drugs also interact with other medicines and affect their metabolism and action. Actual or suspected immunosuppressive agents can be evaluated in terms of their effects on lymphocyte subpopulations in tissues using immunohistochemistry.

<doc id="249961" wikidata="Q1500373" url="?curid=249961" title="Lactic acidosis">
<text>Lactic acidosis refers to the process leading to the production of lactate by anaerobic metabolism. It increases hydrogen ion concentration tending to the state of acidemia or low pH. The result can be detected with high levels of lactate and low levels of bicarbonate. This is usually considered the result of illness but also results from strenuous exercise. The effect on pH is moderated by the presence of respiratory compensation.

Lactic acidosis is usually the result of tissue hypoxia which is not the same as arterial hypoxia. Adequate circulation of blood and perfusion of metabolizing tissue to meet demand is necessary to prevent tissue hypoxia. Lactic acidosis can also be the result of illnesses, medications, poisonings or inborn errors of metabolism that interfere directly with oxygen utilization by cells.

The symptoms are generally attributable to the underlying cause, but may include nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and generalised weakness.

The diagnosis is made on biochemical analysis of blood (often initially on arterial blood gas samples), and once confirmed, generally prompts an investigation to establish the underlying cause to treat the acidosis. In some situations, hemofiltration (purification of the blood) is temporarily required. In rare chronic forms of lactic acidosis caused by mitochondrial disease, a specific diet or dichloroacetate may be used. The prognosis of lactic acidosis depends largely on the underlying cause; in some situations (such as severe infections), it indicates an increased risk of death.

== Classification ==
The Cohen–Woods classification categorizes causes of lactic acidosis as:
* Type A: Decreased tissue oxygenation (e.g., from decreased blood flow)
* Type B
** B1: Underlying diseases (sometimes causing type A)
** B2: Medication or intoxication
** B3: Inborn error of metabolism

== Signs and symptoms ==
Lactic acidosis is commonly found in people who are unwell, such as those with severe heart and/or lung disease, a severe infection with sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to another cause, severe physical trauma, or severe depletion of body fluids. Symptoms in humans include all those of typical metabolic acidosis (nausea, vomiting, generalized muscle weakness, and laboured and deep breathing).

== Causes ==
The several different causes of lactic acidosis include:
* Genetic conditions
** Biotinidase deficiency, multiple carboxylase deficiency, or nongenetic deficiencies of biotin
** Diabetes mellitus and deafness
** Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency
** Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency
** GRACILE syndrome
** Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes
** Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency
** Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency
** Leigh syndrome
* Drugs
** Linezolid
** Paracetamol/acetaminophen poisoning
** Metformin: this risk is low (less than 10 cases for 100,000 patient years), but the risk of metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MALA) increases in certain situations where both the plasma levels of metformin are increased and lactate clearance is impaired. The older related and now withdrawn drug phenformin carried a much higher risk of lactic acidosis.
** Isoniazid toxicity
** Propofol
** Epinephrine
** Propylene glycol (D-lactic acidosis)
** Nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors
** Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine
** Emtricitabine/tenofovir
** Potassium cyanide (cyanide poisoning)
** Fialuridine
* Other
** Thiamine deficiency (especially during TPN)
** Impaired delivery of oxygen to cells in the tissues (e.g., from impaired blood flow (hypoperfusion))
** Bleeding
** Polymyositis
** Ethanol toxicity
** Sepsis
** Shock
** Advanced liver disease
** Diabetic ketoacidosis
** Excessive exercise (overtraining)
** Regional hypoperfusion (e.g., bowel ischemia or marked cellulitis)
** Cancers such as Non-Hodgkin&#x27;s and Burkitt lymphomas
** Pheochromocytoma
** Tumor lysis syndrome
** D-lactic acidosis due to intestinal bacterial flora production in short gut syndrome

== Pathophysiology ==
Glucose metabolism begins with glycolysis, in which the molecule is broken down into pyruvate in ten enzymatic steps. A significant proportion of pyruvate is converted into lactate (the blood lactate-to-pyruvate ratio is normally 10:1). The human metabolism produces about 20 mmol/kg of lactic acid every 24 hours. This happens predominantly in tissues (especially muscle) that have high levels of the &quot;A&quot; isoform of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), which predominantly converts pyruvate into lactate. The lactate is carried by the bloodstream to other tissues where it is converted back to pyruvate by the &quot;B&quot; isoform of LDH (LDHB). Firstly there is gluconeogenesis in the liver (as well as the kidney and some other tissues), where lactate is converted into pyruvate and then into glucose; this is known as the Cori cycle. In addition, pyruvate generated from lactate can be oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which can enter the citric acid cycle to enable ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation.

Elevations in lactate are either a consequence of increased production or of decreased metabolism. With regards to metabolism, this predominantly takes place in the liver (70%), which explains that lactate levels may be elevated in the setting of liver disease.

In &quot;type A&quot; lactic acidosis, the production of lactate is attributable to insufficient oxygen for aerobic metabolism. If there is no oxygen available for the parts of the glucose metabolism that require oxygen (citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation), excess pyruvate will be converted in excess lactate. In &quot;type B&quot; lactic acidosis the lactate accumulates because there is a mismatch between glycolysis activity and the remainder of glucose metabolism. Examples are situations where the sympathetic nervous system is highly active (e.g. severe asthma). There is controversy as to whether elevated lactate in acute illness can be attributed to tissue hypoxia; there is limited empirical support for this theoretical notion.

==Diagnosis==
Acid-base disturbances such as lactic acidosis are typically first assessed using arterial blood gas tests. Testing of venous blood is also available as an alternative as they are effectively interchangeable. Normally resulting lactate concentrations are in the range indicated below:

Lactic acidosis is classically defined as an elevated lactate together with pH &lt; 7.35 and bicarbonate below 20 mmol/L, but this is not required as lactic acidosis may exist together with other acid-base abnormalities that may affect these two parameters.

==Treatment==
If elevated lactate is present in acute illness, supporting the oxygen supply and blood flow are key initial steps. Some vasopressors (drugs that augment the blood pressure) are less effective when lactate levels are high, and some agents that stimulate the beta-2 adrenergic receptor can elevate the lactate further.

Direct removal of lactate from the body (e.g. with hemofiltration or dialysis) is difficult, with limited evidence for benefit; it may not be possible to keep up with the lactate production.

Limited evidence supports the use of sodium bicarbonate solutions to improve the pH (which is associated with increased carbon dioxide generation and may reduce the calcium levels).

Lactic acidosis caused by inherited mitochondrial disorders (type B3) may be treated with a ketogenic diet and possibly with dichloroacetate (DCA), although this may be complicated by peripheral neuropathy and has a weak evidence base.

==Prognosis==
Mild and transient elevations in lactate have limited impact on mortality, whereas sustained and severe lactate elevations are associated with a high mortality.

The mortality of lactic acidosis in people taking metformin was previously reported to be 50%, but in more recent reports this was closer to 25%.

==Other animals==

===Reptiles===
Reptiles, which rely primarily on anaerobic energy metabolism (glycolysis) for intense movements, can be particularly susceptible to lactic acidosis. In particular, during the capture of large crocodiles, the animals&#x27; use of their glycolytic muscles often alters the blood&#x27;s pH to a point where they are unable to respond to stimuli or move. Cases are recorded in which particularly large crocodiles which put up extreme resistance to capture later died of the resulting pH imbalance.

Certain turtle species have been found to be capable of tolerating high levels of lactic acid without experiencing the effects of lactic acidosis. Painted turtles hibernate buried in mud or underwater and do not resurface for the entire winter. As a result, they rely on lactic acid fermentation to provide the majority of their energy needs. Adaptations in particular in the turtle&#x27;s blood composition and shell allow it to tolerate high levels of lactic acid accumulation. In the anoxic conditions where fermentation is dominant, calcium levels in the blood plasma increase. This calcium serves as a buffer, reacting with the excess lactate to form the precipitate calcium lactate. This precipitate is suggested to be reabsorbed by the shell and skeleton, thereby removing it from the bloodstream; studies examining turtles that have been subjected to prolonged anoxic conditions have up to 45% of their lactate stored within their skeletal structure.

===Ruminants===
In ruminant livestock, the cause of clinically serious lactic acidosis is different from the causes described above.

In domesticated ruminants, lactic acidosis may occur as a consequence of ingesting large amounts of grain, especially when the rumen population is poorly adapted to deal with grain. Activity of various rumen organisms results in accumulation of various volatile fatty acids (normally, mostly acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), which are partially dissociated. Although some lactate is normally produced in the rumen, it is normally metabolized by such organisms as &quot;Megasphaera elsdenii&quot; and, to a lesser extent, &quot;Selenomonas ruminantium&quot; and some other organisms. With high grain consumption, the concentration of dissociated organic acids can become quite high, resulting in rumen pH dropping below 6. Within this lower pH range, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; spp. (producing lactate and hydrogen ions) are favored, and &quot;M. elsdenii&quot; and &quot;S. ruminantium&quot; are inhibited, tending to result in a considerable rise of lactate and hydrogen ion concentrations in the rumen fluid. The pKa of lactic acid is low, about 3.9, versus, for example, 4.8 for acetic acid; this contributes to the considerable drop in rumen pH which can occur.

Because of the high solute concentration of the rumen fluid under such conditions, considerable water is translocated from the blood to the rumen along the osmotic potential gradient, resulting in dehydration which cannot be relieved by drinking, and which can ultimately lead to hypovolemic shock. As more lactate accumulates and rumen pH drops, the ruminal concentration of undissociated lactic acid increases. Undissociated lactic acid can cross the rumen wall to the blood, where it dissociates, lowering blood pH. Both L and D isomers of lactic acid are produced in the rumen; these isomers are metabolized by different metabolic pathways, and activity of the principal enzyme involved in metabolism of the D isomer declines greatly with lower pH, tending to result in an increased ratio of D:L isomers as acidosis progresses.

Measures for preventing lactic acidosis in ruminants include avoidance of excessive amounts of grain in the diet, and gradual introduction of grain over a period of several days, to develop a rumen population capable of safely dealing with a relatively high grain intake. Administration of lasalocid or monensin in feed can reduce risk of lactic acidosis in ruminants, inhibiting most of the lactate-producing bacterial species without inhibiting the major lactate fermenters. Also, using a higher feeding frequency to provide the daily grain ration can allow higher grain intake without reducing the pH of the rumen fluid.

Treatment of lactic acidosis in ruminants may involve intravenous administration of dilute sodium bicarbonate, oral administration of magnesium hydroxide, and/or repeated removal of rumen fluids and replacement with water (followed by reinoculation with rumen organisms, if necessary).

<doc id="249962" wikidata="Q1538213" url="?curid=249962" title="Lipodystrophy">
<text>Lipodystrophy syndromes are a group of genetic or acquired disorders in which the body is unable to produce and maintain healthy fat tissue. The medical condition is characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body&#x27;s adipose tissue. A more specific term, &quot;lipoatrophy&quot; (), is used when describing the loss of fat from one area (usually the face). This condition is also characterized by a lack of circulating leptin which may lead to osteosclerosis. The absence of fat tissue is associated with insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic syndrome.

== Types ==
Lipodystrophy can be divided into the following types:
* Congenital lipodystrophy syndromes
** Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome)
** Familial partial lipodystrophy
** Marfanoid–progeroid–lipodystrophy syndrome
** Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature syndrome
* Acquired lipodystrophy syndromes
** Acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome)
** Acquired generalized lipodystrophy
** Centrifugal abdominal lipodystrophy (Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis)
** Lipoatrophia annularis (Ferreira-Marques lipoatrophia)
** Localized lipodystrophy
** HIV-associated lipodystrophy

== Pathogenesis ==
Due to an insufficient capacity of subcutaneous tissue to store fat, fat is deposited in non-adipose tissue (lipotoxicity), leading to insulin resistance. Patients may display hypertriglyceridemia, severe fatty liver disease and little or no adipose tissue. Average patient lifespan is approximately 30 years before death, with liver failure being the usual cause of death. In contrast to the high levels seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with obesity, leptin levels are very low in lipodystrophy.

== Insulin injections ==

Lipodystrophy can appear as a lump or small dent in the skin that forms when a person performs injections repeatedly in the same spot. These types of lipodystrophies are harmless and can be avoided by changing (rotating) the locations of injections. For those with diabetes, using purified insulins and new needles with each injection may also help. (Although, in some cases, rotation of the injection sites may not be enough to prevent lipodystrophy.)

Some of the side-effects of lipodystrophy are the rejection of the injected medication, the slowing down of the absorption of the medication, or trauma which can cause bleeding that, in turn, causes rejection of the medication. In any of these scenarios, the dosage of the medication, such as insulin for diabetics, becomes impossible to gauge correctly and the treatment of the disease for which the medication is administered is impaired, thereby allowing the condition to worsen.

== Antiretroviral drugs ==

Lipodystrophy can be a possible side effect of certain antiretroviral drugs. Lipoatrophy is most commonly seen in patients treated with thymidine analogues and other older HIV drug treatments such as the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] like zidovudine (AZT) and stavudine (d4T). Other lipodystrophies manifest as lipid redistribution, with excess, or lack of, fat in various regions of the body. This is often most noticeable in the face. These include, but are not limited to, having sunken cheeks and/or &quot;humps&quot; on the back or back of the neck (also referred to as buffalo hump) which also exhibits due to excess cortisol (a so-called &quot;stress&quot; hormone).

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is a clinical one, usually established by an experienced endocrinologist.Using a skinfold caliper to measure skinfold thickness in various parts of the body or a total body composition scan using Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry may also help identify the subtype. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry may be useful by providing both regional %fat measurements, and direct visualization of fat distribution by means of a &quot;fat shadow&quot;. A genetic confirmation is sometimes possible, depending on the subtype. However, in up to 40% of partial lipodystrophy patients, a causative gene has not been identified.

==Treatment==
Leptin replacement therapy with human recombinant leptin metreleptin has been shown to be an effective therapy to alleviate the metabolic complications associated with lipodystrophy, and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of generalized lipodystrophy syndromes. In Europe based on EMA, metreleptin should be used in addition to diet to treat lipodystrophy, where patients have loss of fatty tissue under the skin and build-up of fat elsewhere in the body such as in the liver and muscles. The medicine is used in: adults and children above the age of two years with generalised lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome and Lawrence syndrome) and in adults and children above the age of 12 years with partial lipodystrophy (including Barraquer-Simons syndrome), when standard treatments have failed.

Volanesorsen is an Apo-CIII inhibitor that is currently being investigated as a potential therapeutic to reduce levels of hypertriglycerides in Familial Partial Lipodystrophy patients in the BROADEN study.
== Epidemiology ==
Congenital lipodystrophy (due to inherited genetic defect) is estimated to be extremely rare, possibly affecting only one per million persons. Acquired lipodystrophy is much more common, especially affecting persons with HIV infection.

<text>Macrovascular disease is a disease of any large (&quot;macro&quot;) blood vessels in the body. It is a disease of the large blood vessels, including the coronary arteries, the aorta, and the sizable arteries in the brain and in the limbs.

This sometimes occurs when a person has had diabetes for an extended period of time. Fat and blood clots build up in the large blood vessels and stick to the vessel walls.

Three common macrovascular diseases are coronary disease (in the heart), cerebrovascular disease (in the brain), and peripheral vascular disease (in the limbs)

Macrovascular disease (macroangiopathy) refers to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a form of arteriosclerosis (thickening and hardening of arterial walls), characterized by plaque deposits of lipids, fibrous connective tissue, calcium, and other blood substances. Atherosclerosis, by definition, affects only medium and large arteries (excluding arterioles).

Macrovascular disease is associated with the development of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, brain attack (stroke), and increased risk of infection. Type 2 diabetes is more closely associated with macrovascular diseases than type 1 diabetes. Peripheral vascular disease and increased risk of infection have important implications in the care of the acutely ill patient.

<text>Microangiopathy (also known as microvascular disease, small vessel disease (SVD) or microvascular dysfunction) is a disease of the microvessels, small blood vessels in the microcirculation. It can be contrasted to macroangiopathies such as atherosclerosis, where large and medium-sized arteries (e.g., aorta, carotid and coronary arteries) are primarily affected.

Small vessel diseases (SVDs) affect primarily organs that receive significant portions of cardiac output such as the brain, the kidney, and the retina. Thus, SVDs are a major etiologic cause in debilitating conditions such as renal failure, blindness, lacunar infarcts, and dementia.

==Types==

Microangiopathies are involved in a variety of different diseases including:

==Pathophysiology==

The main target of small vessel diseases is the endothelium, which plays a key role in vascular homeostasis. The pathogenesis of SVDs in various organs is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, capillary rarefaction, microthrombi and microvascular remodeling.

Diabetic microangiopathy, which is the most common cause of microangiopathy, is more prevalent in the kidney, retina and vascular endothelium since glucose transport in these sites isn’t regulated by insulin and these tissues cannot stop glucose from entering cells when blood sugar levels are high. Among all biochemical mechanisms involved in diabetic vascular damage such as the polyol pathway and the renin–angiotensin system (RAS), the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) pathway appears to be the most important in the pathogenesis and progression of microvascular complications.

Chronic high blood sugar levels lead to the attachment of sugar molecules to various proteins, including collagen, laminin, and peripheral nerve proteins. This process, called glycosylation, creates advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs formation cross-links these proteins, making them resistant to degradation. This leads to accumulation of AGEs, thickening of the basement membrane, narrowing the blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the tissues and causing ischemic injury.

In addition, oxidative stress, caused by AGEs and the other pathways, causes apoptosis of pericytes and podocytes in the retina and the kidneys respectively leading to capillary wall fragility and increased vascular leakage. This results in local swelling (e.g. macular edema) and impaired tissue function.

===Microvascular diseases as a multisystem disorder===

Some researchers have suggested that SVD may be a multisystem disorder, meaning that it can affect multiple organs in the body, including the heart and brain. This is supported by multiple studies stating that cardiac pathologies are more prevalent in patients with pathological evidence of cerebrovascular SVD and vice versa.

Coronary microvascular diseases (CMDs) can be caused by:
On the other hand, Cerebral SVD encompasses a range of vascular pathologies including arteriosclerosis-related CSVD, where lipohyalinosis causes stenosis of the lumen of the arterioles and amyloid-related CSVD, characterized by the build-up of β-amyloid deposits in small- and medium-caliber cerebral vessels.

The vascular anatomy of the heart and brain is similar in that conduit arteries are distributed on the surface of these organs with tissue perfusion achieved through deep penetrating arteries. Both coronary and cerebral microvascular diseases do share some common risk factors such as hypertension. Why some patients with microvascular angina subsequently develop vascular cognitive impairment and others do not is an unanswered question. Potential underpinning mechanisms include premature vascular aging and clustering of vascular risk factors leading to an accelerated cardiovascular risk.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of microangiopathies can be based on direct visualization of the microcirculation, imaging modalities (e.g. MRI), conventional testings (e.g. ophthalmoscopy for diabetic retinopathy) or other diagnostic measures (e.g. blood smear for schistocytes in thrombotic microangiopathies).

For assessment of the morphological and functional aspects of microcirculation, nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) can be used, in which videocapillaroscopy is performed at the nailfold, where capillaries are arranged with the longitudinal axis parallel to the skin surface, so that they can be examined along their entire length.

NVC has been largely used not only for investigating peripheral microangiopathy, but also as a sort of &quot;window&quot; to systemic microvascular dysfunction. Although its main application is within the connective tissue diseases such as systemic scleroderma and dermatomyositis, it has been employed in non-rheumatic diseases with microvascular involvement such as diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension and COVID-19 infection.
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is another imaging modality that offers high-resolution visualization of the retinal capillary network and can be used to evaluate microcirculation in conditions such as diabetic retinopathy.
Many studies have demonstrated that evaluation of the retinal microvascular changes using OCTA or other methods such as fluorescein angiography may reflect the systemic microvascular functions as in patients with coronary microvascular disease, cerebral small vessel diseases or systemic sclerosis (The potential of retinal microvascularopathy as a biomarker for assessing microvascular status of other circulations).

Unlike the retinal microcirculation, the coronary microvasculature cannot be directly imaged. Instead, a number of different tests can be used to measure how much blood is flowing through the coronary microvasculature. These tests can be used to assess how well the coronary microvasculature is functioning and to diagnose coronary microvascular disease. They include non-invasive measures such as cardiac MRI and invasive measures such as intracoronary Doppler wire.

Similarly, CSVD is typically recognized on both brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, but MRI has greater sensitivity and specificity. Neuroimaging of CSVD primarily involves visualizing radiological phenotypes of CSVD such as recent subcortical infarcts or cerebral microbleeds (CMBs).

== Treatment ==

Treatment options of microangiopathies can be directed at:

A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to damage of small blood vessels may be associated with novel therapeutic approaches, the safety and efficacy of some of which will need to be further investigated. Examples include calcium dobesilate and aldose reductase inhibitors in diabetic microangiopathies and endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary hypertension.

<text>A pancreas transplant is an organ transplant that involves implanting a healthy pancreas (one that can produce insulin) into a person who usually has diabetes.

==Overview==
Because the pancreas is a vital organ, performing functions necessary in the digestion process, the recipient&#x27;s native pancreas is left in place, and the donated pancreas is attached in a different location. In the event of rejection of the new pancreas, which would quickly cause life-threatening diabetes, there would be a significant chance the recipient would not survive very well for long without the native pancreas, however dysfunctional, still in place. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a partial pancreas from a living donor. At present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes, who can develop severe complications. Patients with the most common, and deadliest, form of pancreatic cancer (pancreatic adenomas, which are usually malignant, with a poor prognosis and high risk for metastasis, as opposed to more treatable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic insulinomas) are usually not eligible for valuable pancreatic transplantations, since the condition usually has a very high mortality rate and the disease, which is usually highly malignant and detected too late to treat, could and probably would soon return. Better surgical method can be chosen to minimize the surgical complications with enteric or bladder drainage. Advancement in immunosuppression has improved quality of life after transplantation.

==Medical uses==
In most cases, pancreas transplantation is performed on people with type 1 diabetes with end-stage renal disease, brittle diabetes, and hypoglycaemic unawareness. Other type 2 diabetics can benefit from a pancreas transplant. The indications for a type 2 diabetic are a BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 and low overall insulin requirement (&lt; 1 U/kg/day). The majority of pancreas transplantations (&gt; 90%) are simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantations.

==Complications==
Complications immediately after surgery include clotting of the arteries or veins of the new pancreas (thrombosis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), infection, bleeding and rejection. Rejection may occur immediately or at any time during the patient&#x27;s life. This is because the transplanted pancreas comes from another organism, thus the recipient&#x27;s immune system will consider it as an aggression and try to combat it. Organ rejection is a serious condition and must be treated immediately. In order to prevent it, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Drugs are taken in combination consisting normally of ciclosporin, azathioprine and corticosteroids. But as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient&#x27;s life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil instead of azathioprine.

==Types==
There are four main types of pancreas transplantation:
* Pancreas transplant alone, for the patient with type 1 diabetes who usually has severe, frequent hypoglycemia, but adequate kidney function. This pancreas transplant known as PTA has as of recently been showing up with good results. This is the least performed method of pancreas transplantation and requires that only the pancreas of a donor is given to the recipient.
* Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK), when the pancreas and kidney are transplanted simultaneously from the same deceased donor. This is the most commonly performed pancreas transplant operation. Indications for an SPK are End Stage Renal Disease with type 1 diabetes (with other diabetic complications like neuropathy, gastroparesis etc.) This is the most common type of pancreas transplantation. The basic reason for this is that patients are mostly already on immunosuppressive drugs and the addition of the kidneys simultaneously reduces the risk in surgical procedure.
* Pancreas-after-kidney transplant (PAK), when a cadaveric, or deceased, donor pancreas transplant is performed after a previous, and different, living or deceased donor kidney transplant. This method is usually recommended for diabetic patients after having a successful kidney transplant. The downside of this procedure is that patients are required to go through surgical risk twice.
* Simultaneous deceased donor pancreas and live donor kidney (SPLK) has the benefit of lower rate of delayed graft function than SPK and significantly reduced waiting times, resulting in improved outcomes.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis after pancreas transplantation is very good. Over the recent years, long-term success has improved and risks have decreased. One year after transplantation more than 95% of all patients are still alive and 80–85% of all pancreases are still functional. After transplantation patients need lifelong immunosuppression. Immunosuppression increases the risk for a number of different kinds of infection and cancer.

It is unclear if steroids, which are often used as immunosuppressant, can be replaced with something else.

==History==

As described by a pioneer in the field, D.E. Sutherland, whole pancreas transplantation began as a part of multi-organ transplants, in the mid-to-late 1960s, at the University of Minnesota:

The first pancreas transplantation, performed in a multi-organ transplant with kidney and duodenum, was into a 28-year-old woman; her death three month post-surgery did not obscure the apparent success of the pancreatic replacement. It was performed in 1966 by the team of W.D. Kelly, R.C. Lillehei, F.K. Merkel, Y. Idezuki, F.C. Goetz and coworkers at the University Hospitals, University of Minnesota, three years after the first kidney transplantation. The first living-related partial pancreas transplantation was done in 1979.

In the successive 1980s period, there was significant improvements in immunosuppressive drugs, surgical techniques, and the preservation of organs. The prognosis is very good with 95% of patients still alive after one year post-surgery and 80-85% of all pancreases still functional.

In 2010 Ugo Boggi practices state-of-the-art robotic surgery having performed the first world robotic pancreas transplant and the first world robotic distal selective spleno-renal shunt for the treatment of severe portal hypertension.

<doc id="249971" wikidata="Q426173" url="?curid=249971" title="Proinsulin">
<text>Proinsulin is the prohormone precursor to insulin made in the beta cells of the Pancreatic Islets, specialized regions of the pancreas. In humans, proinsulin is encoded by the &quot;INS&quot; gene. The pancreatic islets only secrete between 1% and 3% of proinsulin intact. However, because proinsulin has a longer half life than insulin, it can account for anywhere from 5–30% of the insulin-like structures circulating in the blood. There are higher concentrations of proinsulin after meals and lower levels when a person is fasting. Additionally, while proinsulin and insulin have structural differences, proinsulin does demonstrate some affinity for the insulin receptor. Due to the relative similarities in structure, proinsulin can produce between 5% and 10% of the metabolic activity similarly induced by insulin.

Proinsulin is the final single chain protein structure secreted by cells before cleavage into mature insulin. Proinsulin was discovered by Professor Donald F. Steiner of the University of Chicago in 1967.

== Structure ==
Proinsulin is made up of 86 residues in humans (81 in cows), and formed by three distinct chains. The A chain, B chain, and the area connecting the two named the C peptide. The correct structure of proinsulin is crucial for the correct folding of mature insulin, as the placement of the C peptide sets the molecule up to create correctly positioned disulfide bonds in and between the A and B chains. There are three disulfide bonds that are necessary for mature insulin to be the correct structure. Two of these disulfide bonds are between the A and B chains, and one is an intra-A chain bond. The disulfide bonds occur between the seventh residues of the A and B chain, the 20th residue of the A chain and the 19th residue of the B chain, and the 6th and 11th residues of the A chain.

The C peptide is between the A and B chains of proinsulin. The connection between the A chain and C peptide is much more stable than the junction between the C peptide and B chain, with alpha helical features being exhibited near the C peptide-A chain connection. The C peptide-A chain junction occurs between residues 64 and 65 of proinsulin. These are lysine and arginine molecules, respectively. The C peptide-B chain connection is between two arginine residues at positions 31 and 32 of proinsulin.

There is conservation of much of the structure of proinsulin among mammalian species, with much of the residue changes seen from one species to another present in the C peptide. That said, the residues of the C peptide that are conserved across species interact with similarly conserved residues on the A and B chains. Thus, it is hypothesized that these conserved residues are important for the functionality of mature insulin.
== Synthesis and Post-translational Modification ==

Proinsulin is synthesized on membrane associated ribosomes found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where it is folded and its disulfide bonds are oxidized. It is then transported to the Golgi apparatus where it is packaged into secretory vesicles, and where it is processed by a series of proteases to form mature insulin. Mature insulin has 35 fewer amino acids; 4 are removed altogether, and the remaining 31 form the C-peptide. The C-peptide is abstracted from the center of the proinsulin sequence; the two other ends (the B chain and A chain) remain connected by disulfide bonds.

The post translational modification of proinsulin to mature insulin only occurs in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. When proinsulin is transported through the Golgi apparatus the C-peptide is cleaved. This cleavage occurs with the aid of two endoproteases. Type I endoproteases, PC1 and PC3, disrupt the C peptide-B chain connection. PC2, a type II endoprotease, cleaves the C peptide-A chain bond. The resulting molecule, now mature insulin, is stored as a hexamer in secretory vesicles and is stabilized with formula_1 ions until it is secreted.
== Immunogenicity ==

When insulin was originally purified from bovine or porcine pancreata, all the proinsulin was not fully removed. When some people used these insulins, the proinsulin may have caused the body to react with a rash, to resist the insulin, or even to make dents or lumps in the skin at the place where the insulin was injected. This can be described as an iatrogenic injury due to slight differences between the proinsulin of different species. Since the late 1970s, when highly purified porcine insulin was introduced, and the level of insulin purity reached 99%, this ceased to be a significant clinical issue. With respect to their influence on insulin pharmacokinetics, moderate concentrations of certain insulin antibodies may be of positive advantage to all diabetics without endogenous insulin secretion (e.g. people with type 1 diabetes) because insulin binding antibodies effectively increase the insulin&#x27;s clearance rate and distribution space and help to prolong its pharmacological and biological half lives.

== Medical Relevance ==
Historically, the focus of many insulin related metabolic diseases has focused on mature insulin. However, in recent years the importance of studying the structure and function of proinsulin or proinsulin:insulin ratio in relation to these diseases has become increasingly clear.

=== Diabetes Mellitus ===
Increased levels of proinsulin in the circulatory system relative to mature insulin concentrations can indicate impending insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes. Additional problems with proinsulin that can lead to diabetes include mutations in the number of cysteines present, which could affect correct folding. If the mutation causes only a mild change it could simply stress the endoplasmic reticulum’s ability to properly fold the protein. This stress, after a while, would lead to a decrease in the number of β-cells producing mature insulin, and would then lead to diabetes mellitus.

=== Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus ===
Postnatal proinsulin is crucial for metabolic regulation. However, proinsulin in neonates is important for normal development of the nerves of the eye, development of the heart, and general survival of embryonic cells. Regulation of the concentration of proinsulin during embryonic development is crucial, as too much or too little of the peptide can cause defects and death of the fetus. Thus far in the study of neonatal diabetes mellitus, only amino acid change mutations found in the B domain lead to the disease.

<text>The Battle of Dun Nechtain or Battle of Nechtansmere (; ) was fought between the Picts, led by King Bridei Mac Bili, and the Northumbrians, led by King Ecgfrith, on 20 May 685.

The Northumbrian hegemony over northern Britain, won by Ecgfrith&#x27;s predecessors, had begun to disintegrate. Several of Northumbria&#x27;s subject nations had rebelled in recent years, leading to a number of large-scale battles against the Picts, Mercians and Irish, with varied success. After sieges of neighbouring territories carried out by the Picts, Ecgfrith led his forces against them, despite advice to the contrary, in an effort to reassert his suzerainty over the Pictish nations.

A feigned retreat by the Picts drew the Northumbrians into an ambush at Dun Nechtain near the lake of Linn Garan. The battle site has long been thought to have been near the present-day village of Dunnichen in Angus. Recent research, however, has suggested a more northerly location near Dunachton, on the shores of Loch Insh in Badenoch and Strathspey.

The battle ended with a decisive Pictish victory which severely weakened Northumbria&#x27;s power in northern Britain. Ecgfrith was killed in battle, along with the greater part of his army. The Pictish victory marked their independence from Northumbria, who never regained their dominance in the north.

==Background==
During the seventh century AD, the Northumbrians gradually extended their territory to the north. The &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; record a siege of &quot;Etain&quot; in 638, which has been interpreted as Northumbria&#x27;s conquest of Eidyn (Edinburgh) during the reign of Oswald, marking the annexation of Gododdin territories to the south of the River Forth.

To the north of the Forth, the Pictish nations consisted at this time of the Kingdom of Fortriu to the north of the Mounth, and a &quot;Southern Pictish Zone&quot; between there and the Forth. Evidence from the eighth century Anglo-Saxon historian Bede points to the Picts also being subjugated by the Northumbrians during Oswald&#x27;s reign, and suggests that this subjugation continued into the reign of his successor, Oswiu.

Ecgfrith succeeded Oswiu as king of Northumbria in 670. Soon after, the Picts rose in rebellion against Northumbrian subjugation at the Battle of Two Rivers, recorded in the 8th century by Stephen of Ripon, hagiographer of Wilfrid. Ecgfrith was aided by a sub-king, Beornhæth, who may have been a leader of the Southern Picts, and the rebellion ended in disaster for the Northern Picts of Fortriu. Their king, Drest mac Donuel, was deposed and was replaced by Bridei mac Bili.

By 679, the Northumbrian hegemony seems to have started to fall apart. The Irish annals record a Mercian victory over Ecgfrith at which Ecgfrith&#x27;s brother, Ælfwine of Deira, was killed. Sieges were recorded at Dunnottar, in the northernmost region of the &quot;Southern Pictish Zone&quot; near Stonehaven in 680, and at Dundurn in Strathearn in 682. The antagonists in these sieges are not recorded, but the most reasonable interpretation is thought to be that Bridei&#x27;s forces were the assailants.

Bridei is also recorded as having &quot;destroyed&quot; the Orkney Islands in 681, at a time when the Northumbrian church was undergoing major religious reform. It had followed the traditions of the Columban church of Iona until the Synod of Whitby in 664 at which it pledged loyalty to the Roman Church. The Northumbrian diocese was divided and a number of new episcopal sees created. One of these was founded at Abercorn on the south coast of the Firth of Forth, and Trumwine was consecrated as Bishop of the Picts. Bridei, who was enthusiastically involved with the church of Iona, is unlikely to have viewed an encroachment of the Northumbrian-sponsored Roman Church favourably.

The attacks on the Southern Pictish Zone at Dunnottar and Dundurn represented a major threat to Ecgfrith&#x27;s suzerainty. Ecgfrith was contending with other challenges to his overlordship. In June 684, countering a Gaelic-Briton alliance, he sent his armies, led by Berhtred, son of Beornhæth, to Brega in Ireland. Ecgfrith&#x27;s force decimated the local population and destroyed many churches, actions which are treated with scorn by Bede.

==Account of the battle==
While none of the historical sources explicitly state Ecgfrith&#x27;s reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, the consensus is that it was to reassert Northumbria&#x27;s control over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th-century work &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; (written around a century later).

Ecgfrith&#x27;s attack on Fortriu was made against the counsel of his advisors, including Cuthbert, who had recently been made Bishop of Lindisfarne. The Picts, led by Bridei, feigned retreat and drew Ecgfrith&#x27;s Northumbrian force into an ambush on Saturday, 20 May 685 at a lake in mountains near &quot;Duin Nechtain&quot;. The Northumbrian army was defeated and Ecgfrith slain.

==Location==

The site of the battle is uncertain. Until relatively recently the battle was most commonly known by its Northumbrian name, the Battle of &quot;Nechtansmere&quot;, from the Old English for &#x27;Nechtan&#x27;s lake&#x27;, following 12th-century English historian Symeon of Durham. The location of the battle near a lake is reinforced by Nennius&#x27; record of the conflict as &quot;Gueith Linn Garan&quot;, Old Welsh for &#x27;Battle of Crane Lake&#x27;. It is likely that &quot;Linn Garan&quot; was the original Pictish name for the lake.

The most complete narrative of the battle itself is given by Bede, who nevertheless fails to inform us of the location other than his mention that it took place &#x27;in straits of inaccessible mountains&#x27;.

The Irish Annals have provided perhaps the most useful resource for identifying the battle site, giving the location as &quot;Dún Nechtain&quot;, &#x27;Nechtan&#x27;s Fort&#x27;, a name that has survived into modern usage in two separate instances.

===Dunnichen===

Dunnichen in Angus was first identified as a possible location for the battle by antiquarian George Chalmers in the early 19th century. Chalmers notes that the name &#x27;Dunnichen&#x27; can be found in early charters of Arbroath Abbey as &#x27;Dun Nechtan&#x27;. He further suggests a site, &#x27;Dunnichen Moss&#x27; (), to the east of the village, which he informs us had recently been drained but can be seen in old maps as a small lake. Earlier local tradition, related by Headrick in the Second Statistical Account, claimed that the site was the location of the Battle of Camlann, where King Arthur fought Mordred.

More recent suggestions for the battle site include the valley to the north of Dunnichen Hill, centering on Rescobie Loch () and Restenneth Loch (), which is now much reduced following drainage in the 18th century.

The battle scene inscribed on the Aberlemno kirk yard stone is often cited as evidence for the battle site. This interpretation was made based on the stone&#x27;s proximity to Dunnichen, only to the north, but while the short distance seems compelling, the stone is unlikely to be any earlier than mid-8th century, and the ornamentation of the stone, including the animal forms used and the style of weaponry depicted, suggests it may be as late as the mid-9th century. Prior to being linked with the Battle of Nechtansmere, the Aberlemno stone had been cited as evidence for the Battle of Barry (now known to be historically inauthentic), and there are a number of other possible interpretations for the carving.

===Dunachton===

In a paper published in 2006, historian Alex Woolf gives a number of reasons for doubting Dunnichen as the battle site, most notably the absence of &quot;inaccessible mountains&quot; in mid-Angus. He makes a case for an alternative site at Dunachton in Badenoch (), on the north-western shore of Loch Insh, which shares Dunnichen&#x27;s toponymical origin of Dún Nechtain. James Fraser of Edinburgh University suggests that, while it is too early to discount Dunnichen as a potential battle site, locating it there requires an amount of &quot;special pleading&quot; that Dunachton does not need.

==Aftermath==
Ecgfrith&#x27;s defeat at Dun Nechtain devastated Northumbria&#x27;s power and influence in the North of Britain. Bede recounts that the Picts recovered their lands that had been held by the Northumbrians and Dál Riatan Scots. He goes on to tell how the Northumbrians who did not flee the Pictish territory were killed or enslaved.

The Northumbrian/Roman diocese of the Picts was abandoned, with Trumwine and his monks fleeing to Whitby, stalling Roman Catholic expansion in Scotland.

While further battles between the Northumbrians and Picts are recorded, for example in 697 when Beornhæth&#x27;s son Berhtred was killed, the Battle of Dunnichen marks the point in which Pictish independence from Northumbria was permanently secured.

<doc id="249976" wikidata="Q199506" url="?curid=249976" title="El gran Carlemany">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;The Great Charlemagne&quot;) is the national anthem of the Principality of Andorra. Enric Marfany Bons composed the music, while the lyrics were authored by Joan Benlloch i Vivó, written in a first-person narrative from the point of view of Andorra. It was adopted as the national anthem on 8 September 1921, which is also the national day of Andorra. The lyrics make reference to several key aspects of Andorran culture and history, such as the heritage of the Carolingian Empire.

==History==
&quot;El Gran Carlemany&quot; was composed by Enric Marfany Bons (1871–1942), who was a priest. The lyrics to the song were penned by Juan Benlloch i Vivó (1864–1926), who served as the Bishop of Urgell from 1906 to 1919. This position also made him an &quot;ex officio&quot; Co–Prince of Andorra. The song was officially designated as the country&#x27;s national anthem on 8 September 1921, when it was sung at the country&#x27;s cathedral for the first time. The day it was adopted – 8 September – is the National Day of Andorra. This coincides with the feast day of Our Lady of Meritxell, the country&#x27;s patron saint, who is mentioned in the lyrics.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;El Gran Carlemany&quot; give a short account of Andorra&#x27;s history &quot;in a first-person narrative&quot;. It recounts the traditional Andorran legend that Charlemagne reconquered the region from the Moors between 788 and 790, after the Catalan people had guided his army through the rugged valleys, which Charlemagne compensated with granting Andorra its independence, and its first borders were delineated that same year. It formed part of the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;, a buffer zone formed by Charlemagne in order to protect his state (the Carolingian Empire). According to legend, he was responsible for restructuring the country, reintroducing Christianity to its people and overseeing the construction of monasteries. Because of these accomplishments, he was given &quot;a mythical aura&quot; and is regarded as the founder of Andorra.

The hymn begins with &quot;&quot; (&quot;Great Charlemagne my father&quot;) and memorialises this view and celebrates the country&#x27;s status as &quot;the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire&quot;, since it is the only remnant of the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;.

<doc id="249980" wikidata="Q227866" url="?curid=249980" title="Angola Avante">
<text>&quot;&quot; (, ) is the national anthem of Angola. Ruy Mingas composed the music, while the lyrics were authored by Manuel Rui. It was adopted as the national anthem in November 1975, when the country gained its independence from Portugal. The lyrics make reference to several key events of the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), which has been in power since independence and was the only party in Angola until 1992.

== History ==
&quot;Angola Avante&quot; was composed by Ruy Mingas. The lyrics to the song were penned by Manuel Rui Alves Monteiro (1941–), an author who studied in Huambo and is affiliated with both the country&#x27;s Writer Union and Union of Artists and Composers. He is one of the best-selling writers in the capital city Luanda – according to an &quot;informal survey&quot; conducted in July 2003 – and writes about &quot;everyday life&quot; in the country using satire and irony. The song was officially designated as the country&#x27;s national anthem in 1975, when the country gained independence on 11 November that year. It is enshrined under Article 164 of the constitution of Angola.

=== Proposed changes ===
Its lyrics refer to several key events in the history of the MPLA. However, this has been rendered &quot;obsolete&quot; since the end of the one-party state in 1992. As a result, there have been efforts to modify the national anthem, along with other national symbols. However, none of these have come to fruition, and the anthem remains unchanged as of 2014.

== Lyrics ==
The lyrics of &quot;Angola Avante&quot; allude to how the country and its people will progress forward in the future. It has been classified by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;′s Ivan Hewett as one of several contemporary national anthems that convey &quot;a more martial tone&quot; inspired by &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;.

The latter third of both verses is usually considered refrain and repeated; the chorus is also repeated twice during each rendition.

=== Portuguese (official language) ===
=== Kikongo (national language) ===
=== English translation ===
== In popular culture ==
The name of the national anthem is used as a nickname for an inter-community association football competition held to boost sports activities both in Angola and among people from the Portuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP) living in Portugal. Hosted in Portugal in 2011 and 2013, the latter tournament featured teams from Brazil, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and São Tomé and Príncipe.

<text>&quot;Fair Antigua, We Salute Thee&quot; is the national anthem of Antigua and Barbuda. Written by Novelle Hamilton Richards and composed by Walter Garnet Picart Chambers, it was adopted in 1967 while Antigua and Barbuda were still a British colony. It was adopted as the national anthem upon independence in 1981.

==Lyrics==
The first verse is usually only performed during official events.

== Former 1967-1981 lyrics ==
I

Fair Antigua we salute thee

Proudly we this Anthem raise

To thy glory and thy beauty

Joyfully we sing the praise

Of the virtues all bestowed

On thy sons and daughters free

Ever striving, ever seeking

Dwell in Love and Unity.

<text>Custody and repatriation (C&amp;R; ) was an administrative procedure, established in 1982 and abolished in 2003, by which the police in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (usually cities) could detain people if they did not have a residence permit (hukou) or temporary living permit (&quot;zanzhuzheng&quot;), and return them to the place where they could legally live or work (usually rural areas). At times the requirement included possession of a valid national identity card. The system was abolished in 2003 after the death of Sun Zhigang, a migrant worker who died from physical abuse while being detained under the C&amp;R system in Guangzhou.

==Background==
In China there were reported to be some 800 detention camps in 2000 (not including Beijing), and by then several million people had been through them. As well as migrant workers, the Chinese camps usually contained vagrants, beggars, petitioners, and criminals, and the police (Public Security Bureau) earned income by this traffic and sometimes workers&#x27; unpaid labor. Often the detentions were unfairly long.

==History==
The ostensible reason for the C&amp;R regulation in 1982 in China was to ameliorate the situation of people in the cities who were beggars or homeless. Originally it applied to &quot;three withouts persons&quot;, those with &quot;no fixed place of residence, no means of livelihood and no permits to live in the city in question&quot; but later it was applied in 1991 to others without just the residence or work permits. It built on a 1961 party directive implementing the hukou system of residence (traditional family registers found in several Asian countries), work permits (issued by police on behalf of work units or employers) to prevent uncontrolled population movements, as passports and visas do internationally, and Resident Identity Cards. In turn, this regulation extended older rules that were used to enforce extrajudicial movements of Nationalist troops away from liberated cities. But as the economic development of cities in the east later required increased domestic migrant workers, the regulations were not adequately adapted or were unfairly enforced, by the Public Security Bureau (police, supposed to be in charge of deportation) instead of the Ministry of Civil Affairs (supposed to be in charge of detention). These abuses became apparent in years before 2003 and there were internal and external warnings and discussion, with some improvements but little effect overall. There were some unpublicized deaths similar to what later occurred.

==Debate and abolition==

The legal procedure of C&amp;R for migrant workers was ended by the central government in 2003 after the death of Sun Zhigang, a migrant worker who died from physical abuse while being detained under the C&amp;R system in Guangzhou.

In reaction to Sun&#x27;s death, two groups of senior Chinese legal scholars wrote to the National People&#x27;s Congress, questioning the constitutionality of the custody and repatriation regulation. One particular problem with the regulations was said to be that they had been adopted as regulations by the State Council and not as a law by the full Congress. As a result, it was argued, the C&amp;R law for migrant workers was unconstitutional, on the grounds that it violated citizens&#x27; rights articles of the Constitution. As in many other countries, Chinese law does not provide for constitutional judicial review, and — as in systems without a constitution, such as the UK — the legislature or administration instead of judges must change laws deemed unconstitutional. There has been some movement by legal reformers to use courts and bureaucracy to experiment with constitutionalism.

A similar argument was that the custody and repatriation regulations &quot;violate the 1996 Administrative Punishment Law, which states that administrative punishments which restrict personal freedom may only be authorized by laws passed by the [full] Congress.&quot; Both criticisms echoed statements published in earlier years by lawyers and legal scholars.

In addition to the legal arguments, some reports by those with contact with the detention centers (including an official report) indicated that not only were the conditions worse than prisons or reeducation camps (including beatings and prolonged detentions without trial), but also sometimes the police used the system to kidnap and extort more than expenses from the families of the accused. These reports echoed earlier ignored warnings.

On 20 June 2003, Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the abolition of the custody and repatriation system, effective August 1. The detention centers would be replaced by service stations to care for poor beggars or homeless persons under the new &quot;Measures for Assisting Vagrants and Beggars with No Means of Support in Cities&quot;. The centers for vagrants are not allowed to collect fees from families nor require them to work. The legal system of hukou and residency and work permits for migrant workers was unchanged.

<text>In mathematics, the binary logarithm () is the power to which the number must be raised to obtain the value . That is, for any real number ,
:formula_1
For example, the binary logarithm of is , the binary logarithm of is , the binary logarithm of is , and the binary logarithm of is .

The binary logarithm is the logarithm to the base and is the inverse function of the power of two function. There are several alternatives to the notation for the binary logarithm; see the Notation section below.

Historically, the first application of binary logarithms was in music theory, by Leonhard Euler: the binary logarithm of a frequency ratio of two musical tones gives the number of octaves by which the tones differ. Binary logarithms can be used to calculate the length of the representation of a number in the binary numeral system, or the number of bits needed to encode a message in information theory. In computer science, they count the number of steps needed for binary search and related algorithms. Other areas
in which the binary logarithm is frequently used include combinatorics, bioinformatics, the design of sports tournaments, and photography.

Binary logarithms are included in the standard C mathematical functions and other mathematical software packages.

==History==
The powers of two have been known since antiquity; for instance, they appear in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, Props. IX.32 (on the factorization of powers of two) and IX.36 (half of the Euclid–Euler theorem, on the structure of even perfect numbers).
And the binary logarithm of a power of two is just its position in the ordered sequence of powers of two.
On this basis, Michael Stifel has been credited with publishing the first known table of binary logarithms in 1544. His book &quot;Arithmetica Integra&quot; contains several tables that show the integers with their corresponding powers of two. Reversing the rows of these tables allow them to be interpreted as tables of binary logarithms.

Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain mathematician Virasena is credited with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena&#x27;s concept of &quot;ardhacheda&quot; has been defined as the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.

The modern form of a binary logarithm, applying to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.

==Definition and properties==
The binary logarithm function may be defined as the inverse function to the power of two function, which is a strictly increasing function over the positive real numbers and therefore has a unique inverse.
Alternatively, it may be defined as , where is the natural logarithm, defined in any of its standard ways. Using the complex logarithm in this definition allows the binary logarithm to be extended to the complex numbers.

As with other logarithms, the binary logarithm obeys the following equations, which can be used to simplify formulas that combine binary logarithms with multiplication or exponentiation:
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
For more, see list of logarithmic identities.

==Notation==
In mathematics, the binary logarithm of a number is often written as . However, several other notations for this function have been used or proposed, especially in application areas.

Some authors write the binary logarithm as , the notation listed in &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;. Donald Knuth credits this notation to a suggestion of Edward Reingold, but its use in both information theory and computer science dates to before Reingold was active. The binary logarithm has also been written as with a prior statement that the default base for the logarithm is . Another notation that is often used for the same function (especially in the German scientific literature) is , from Latin &quot; &quot; or &quot;logarithmus dyadis&quot;.
The , ISO 31-11 and ISO 80000-2 standards recommend yet another notation, . According to these standards, should not be used for the binary logarithm, as it is instead reserved for the common logarithm .

==Applications==
===Information theory===
The number of digits (bits) in the binary representation of a positive integer is the integral part of , i.e.

:formula_5

In information theory, the definition of the amount of self-information and information entropy is often expressed with the binary logarithm, corresponding to making the bit the fundamental unit of information. With these units, the Shannon–Hartley theorem expresses the information capacity of a channel as the binary logarithm of its signal-to-noise ratio, plus one. However, the natural logarithm and the nat are also used in alternative notations for these definitions.

===Combinatorics===

Although the natural logarithm is more important than the binary logarithm in many areas of pure mathematics such as number theory and mathematical analysis, the binary logarithm has several applications in combinatorics:
*Every binary tree with leaves has height at least , with equality when is a power of two and the tree is a complete binary tree. Relatedly, the Strahler number of a river system with tributary streams is at most .
*Every family of sets with different sets has at least elements in its union, with equality when the family is a power set.
*Every partial cube with vertices has isometric dimension at least , and has at most edges, with equality when the partial cube is a hypercube graph.
*According to Ramsey&#x27;s theorem, every -vertex undirected graph has either a clique or an independent set of size logarithmic in . The precise size that can be guaranteed is not known, but the best bounds known on its size involve binary logarithms. In particular, all graphs have a clique or independent set of size at least and almost all graphs do not have a clique or independent set of size larger than .
*From a mathematical analysis of the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model of random shuffles, one can show that the number of times one needs to shuffle an -card deck of cards, using riffle shuffles, to get a distribution on permutations that is close to uniformly random, is approximately . This calculation forms the basis for a recommendation that 52-card decks should be shuffled seven times.

===Computational complexity===

The binary logarithm also frequently appears in the analysis of algorithms, not only because of the frequent use of binary number arithmetic in algorithms, but also because binary logarithms occur in the analysis of algorithms based on two-way branching. If a problem initially has choices for its solution, and each iteration of the algorithm reduces the number of choices by a factor of two, then the number of iterations needed to select a single choice is again the integral part of . This idea is used in the analysis of several algorithms and data structures. For example, in binary search, the size of the problem to be solved is halved with each iteration, and therefore roughly iterations are needed to obtain a solution for a problem of size . Similarly, a perfectly balanced binary search tree containing elements has height .

The running time of an algorithm is usually expressed in big O notation, which is used to simplify expressions by omitting their constant factors and lower-order terms. Because logarithms in different bases differ from each other only by a constant factor, algorithms that run in time can also be said to run in, say, time. The base of the logarithm in expressions such as or is therefore not important and can be omitted. However, for logarithms that appear in the exponent of a time bound, the base of the logarithm cannot be omitted. For example, is not the same as because the former is equal to and the latter to .

Algorithms with running time are sometimes called linearithmic. Some examples of algorithms with running time or are:

*Average time quicksort and other comparison sort algorithms
*Searching in balanced binary search trees
*Exponentiation by squaring
*Longest increasing subsequence
Binary logarithms also occur in the exponents of the time bounds for some divide and conquer algorithms, such as the Karatsuba algorithm for multiplying -bit numbers in time ,
and the Strassen algorithm for multiplying matrices in time
. The occurrence of binary logarithms in these running times can be explained by reference to the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences.

===Bioinformatics===

In bioinformatics, microarrays are used to measure how strongly different genes are expressed in a sample of biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.

Data points obtained in this way are often visualized as a scatterplot in which one or both of the coordinate axes are binary logarithms of intensity ratios, or in visualizations such as the MA plot and RA plot that rotate and scale these log ratio scatterplots.

===Music theory===
In music theory, the interval or perceptual difference between two tones is determined by the ratio of their frequencies. Intervals coming from rational number ratios with small numerators and denominators are perceived as particularly euphonious. The simplest and most important of these intervals is the octave, a frequency ratio of . The number of octaves by which two tones differ is the binary logarithm of their frequency ratio.

To study tuning systems and other aspects of music theory that require finer distinctions between tones, it is helpful to have a measure of the size of an interval that is finer than an octave and is additive (as logarithms are) rather than multiplicative (as frequency ratios are). That is, if tones , , and form a rising sequence of tones, then the measure of the interval from to plus the measure of the interval from to should equal the measure of the interval from to . Such a measure is given by the cent, which divides the octave into equal intervals ( semitones of cents each). Mathematically, given tones with frequencies and , the number of cents in the interval from to is
:formula_6
The millioctave is defined in the same way, but with a multiplier of instead of .

===Sports scheduling===
In competitive games and sports involving two players or teams in each game or match, the binary logarithm indicates the number of rounds necessary in a single-elimination tournament required to determine a winner. For example, a tournament of players requires rounds to determine the winner, a tournament of teams requires rounds, etc. In this case, for players/teams where is not a power of 2, is rounded up since it is necessary to have at least one round in which not all remaining competitors play. For example, is approximately , which rounds up to , indicating that a tournament of teams requires rounds (either two teams sit out the first round, or one team sits out the second round). The same number of rounds is also necessary to determine a clear winner in a Swiss-system tournament.

===Photography===
In photography, exposure values are measured in terms of the binary logarithm of the amount of light reaching the film or sensor, in accordance with the Weber–Fechner law describing a logarithmic response of the human visual system to light. A single stop of exposure is one unit on a base- logarithmic scale. More precisely, the exposure value of a photograph is defined as
:formula_7
where is the f-number measuring the aperture of the lens during the exposure, and is the number of seconds of exposure.

Binary logarithms (expressed as stops) are also used in densitometry, to express the dynamic range of light-sensitive materials or digital sensors.

==Calculation==
===Conversion from other bases===
An easy way to calculate on calculators that do not have a function is to use the natural logarithm () or the common logarithm ( or ) functions, which are found on most scientific calculators. To change the logarithm base to 2 from , , or any other base , one can use the formulae:

:formula_8
Approximately,
:formula_9

===Integer rounding===
The binary logarithm can be made into a function from integers and to integers by rounding it up or down. These two forms of integer binary logarithm are related by this formula:

:formula_10
The definition can be extended by defining formula_11. Extended in this way, this function is related to the number of leading zeros of the 32-bit unsigned binary representation of , .
:formula_12

The integer binary logarithm can be interpreted as the zero-based index of the most significant bit in the input. In this sense it is the complement of the find first set operation, which finds the index of the least significant bit. Many hardware platforms include support for finding the number of leading zeros, or equivalent operations, which can be used to quickly find the binary logarithm. The codice_1 and codice_2 functions in the Linux kernel and in some versions of the libc software library also compute the binary logarithm (rounded up to an integer, plus one).

===Iterative approximation===

For a general positive real number, the binary logarithm may be computed in two parts.
First, one computes the integer part, formula_13 (called the characteristic of the logarithm).
This reduces the problem to one where the argument of the logarithm is in a restricted range, the interval , simplifying the second step of computing the fractional part (the mantissa of the logarithm).
For any , there exists a unique integer such that , or equivalently . Now the integer part of the logarithm is simply , and the fractional part is . In other words:
:formula_14
For normalized floating-point numbers, the integer part is given by the floating-point exponent, and for integers it can be determined by performing a count leading zeros operation.

The fractional part of the result is and can be computed iteratively, using only elementary multiplication and division.
The algorithm for computing the fractional part can be described in pseudocode as follows:
# Start with a real number in the half-open interval . If , then the algorithm is done, and the fractional part is zero.
# Otherwise, square repeatedly until the result lies in the interval . Let be the number of squarings needed. That is, with chosen such that is in .
# Taking the logarithm of both sides and doing some algebra: formula_15
# Once again is a real number in the interval . Return to step 1 and compute the binary logarithm of using the same method.

The result of this is expressed by the following recursive formulas, in which formula_16 is the number of squarings required in the &quot;i&quot;-th iteration of the algorithm:
formula_17

In the special case where the fractional part in step 1 is found to be zero, this is a &quot;finite&quot; sequence terminating at some point. Otherwise, it is an infinite series that converges according to the ratio test, since each term is strictly less than the previous one (since every ). See Horner&#x27;s method. For practical use, this infinite series must be truncated to reach an approximate result. If the series is truncated after the -th term, then the error in the result is less than .

===Software library support===
The codice_3 function is included in the standard C mathematical functions. The default version of this function takes double precision arguments but variants of it allow the argument to be single-precision or to be a long double. In computing environments supporting complex numbers and implicit type conversion such as MATLAB the argument to the codice_3 function is allowed to be a negative number, returning a complex one.

<text>The Hong Kong Museum of History is a public museum that preserves Hong Kong&#x27;s historical and cultural heritage. It is located next to the Hong Kong Science Museum, in Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

The collections of the museum encompass natural history, archaeology, ethnography and local history.

==History==

The museum was established by the Urban Council in July 1975 when the City Museum and Art Gallery was split into the Hong Kong Museum of History and Hong Kong Museum of Art; some of the Museum of History&#x27;s collections were on display at the City Museum and Art Gallery&#x27;s original 1962 location at the City Hall.

From 1975 to 1983, the Hong Kong Museum of History was housed in a rented space within Star House. In 1983, the Museum was moved to a temporary location (which now houses Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre) in Kowloon Park. It was moved to its present premises near Hong Kong Science Museum on Chatham Road South, Tsim Sha Tsui in 1998. It is currently managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong Government.

==The Hong Kong Story==
The Hong Kong Story permanent exhibition was a showcase of the history and development of Hong Kong. Occupying an area of , The Hong Kong Story comprised eight galleries located on two floors. Through the display of over 4,000 exhibits with the use of 750 graphic panels, a number of dioramas and multi-media programmes, and enhanced with special audio-visual and lighting effects, The Hong Kong Story outlined the natural environment, folk culture, and historical development of Hong Kong. The exhibition started from the Devonian period 400 million years ago and concluded with the Handover of Hong Kong in 1997. The museum exhibited prehistoric fossils, colonial documents from the 19th Century and Ancient Chinese pottery.

The permanent exhibit is now closed. Museum visitors can instead browse exhibits about the Chinese Communist Party and the Hong Kong national security law.

==Branch museums==
The museum runs five branch museums: Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence at Shau Kei Wan, Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum at Sham Shui Po, and Law Uk Folk Museum at Chai Wan, Fireboat Alexander Grantham Exhibition Gallery inside the Quarry Bay Park and Dr. Sun Yat-sen Museum at Mid-Levels in Central.

==Public transport==
The museum is accessible within walking distance West from Hung Hom station or north from East Tsim Sha Tsui station of MTR.

<text>The molecular clock is a figurative term for a technique that uses the mutation rate of biomolecules to deduce the time in prehistory when two or more life forms diverged. The biomolecular data used for such calculations are usually nucleotide sequences for DNA, RNA, or amino acid sequences for proteins.

==Early discovery and genetic equidistance==
The notion of the existence of a so-called &quot;molecular clock&quot; was first attributed to Émile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling who, in 1962, noticed that the number of amino acid differences in hemoglobin between different lineages changes roughly linearly with time, as estimated from fossil evidence. They generalized this observation to assert that the rate of evolutionary change of any specified protein was approximately constant over time and over different lineages (known as the molecular clock hypothesis).

The genetic equidistance phenomenon was first noted in 1963 by Emanuel Margoliash, who wrote: &quot;It appears that the number of residue differences between cytochrome c of any two species is mostly conditioned by the time elapsed since the lines of evolution leading to these two species originally diverged. If this is correct, the cytochrome c of all mammals should be equally different from the cytochrome c of all birds. Since fish diverges from the main stem of vertebrate evolution earlier than either birds or mammals, the cytochrome c of both mammals and birds should be equally different from the cytochrome c of fish. Similarly, all vertebrate cytochrome c should be equally different from the yeast protein.&quot; For example, the difference between the cytochrome c of a carp and a frog, turtle, chicken, rabbit, and horse is a very constant 13% to 14%. Similarly, the difference between the cytochrome c of a bacterium and yeast, wheat, moth, tuna, pigeon, and horse ranges from 64% to 69%. Together with the work of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, the genetic equidistance result led directly to the formal postulation of the molecular clock hypothesis in the early 1960s.

Similarly, Vincent Sarich and Allan Wilson in 1967 demonstrated that molecular differences among modern primates in albumin proteins showed that approximately constant rates of change had occurred in all the lineages they assessed. The basic logic of their analysis involved recognizing that if one species lineage had evolved more quickly than a sister species lineage since their common ancestor, then the molecular differences between an outgroup (more distantly related) species and the faster-evolving species should be larger (since more molecular changes would have accumulated on that lineage) than the molecular differences between the outgroup species and the slower-evolving species. This method is known as the relative rate test. Sarich and Wilson&#x27;s paper reported, for example, that human (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) and chimpanzee (&quot;Pan troglodytes&quot;) albumin immunological cross-reactions suggested they were about equally different from Ceboidea (New World Monkey) species (within experimental error). This meant that they had both accumulated approximately equal changes in albumin since their shared common ancestor. This pattern was also found for all the primate comparisons they tested. When calibrated with the few well-documented fossil branch points (such as no Primate fossils of modern aspect found before the K-T boundary), this led Sarich and Wilson to argue that the human-chimp divergence probably occurred only ~4–6 million years ago.

==Relationship with neutral theory==

The observation of a clock-like rate of molecular change was originally purely phenomenological. Later, the work of Motoo Kimura developed the neutral theory of molecular evolution, which predicted a molecular clock. Let there be N individuals, and to keep this calculation simple, let the individuals be haploid (i.e. have one copy of each gene). Let the rate of neutral mutations (i.e. mutations with no effect on fitness) in a new individual be formula_1. The probability that this new mutation will become fixed in the population is then 1/N, since each copy of the gene is as good as any other. Every generation, each individual can have new mutations, so there are formula_1N new neutral mutations in the population as a whole. That means that each generation, formula_1 new neutral mutations will become fixed. If most changes seen during molecular evolution are neutral, then fixations in a population will accumulate at a clock-rate that is equal to the rate of neutral mutations in an individual.

==Calibration==
To use molecular clocks to estimate divergence times, molecular clocks need to be &quot;calibrated&quot;. This is because molecular data alone does not contain any information on absolute times. For viral phylogenetics and ancient DNA studies—two areas of evolutionary biology where it is possible to sample sequences over an evolutionary timescale—the dates of the intermediate samples can be used to calibrate the molecular clock. However, most phylogenies require that the molecular clock be calibrated using independent evidence about dates, such as the fossil record. There are two general methods for calibrating the molecular clock using fossils: node calibration and tip calibration.

===Node calibration===
Sometimes referred to as node dating, node calibration is a method for time-scaling phylogenetic trees by specifying time constraints for one or more nodes in the tree. Early methods of clock calibration only used a single fossil constraint (e.g. non-parametric rate smoothing), but newer methods (BEAST and ) allow for the use of multiple fossils to calibrate molecular clocks. The oldest fossil of a clade is used to constrain the minimum possible age for the node representing the most recent common ancestor of the clade. However, due to incomplete fossil preservation and other factors, clades are typically older than their oldest fossils. In order to account for this, nodes are allowed to be older than the minimum constraint in node calibration analyses. However, determining how much older the node is allowed to be is challenging. There are a number of strategies for deriving the maximum bound for the age of a clade including those based on birth-death models, fossil stratigraphic distribution analyses, or taphonomic controls. Alternatively, instead of a maximum and a minimum, a probability density can be used to represent the uncertainty about the age of the clade. These calibration densities can take the shape of standard probability densities (e.g. normal, lognormal, exponential, gamma) that can be used to express the uncertainty associated with divergence time estimates. Determining the shape and parameters of the probability distribution is not trivial, but there are methods that use not only the oldest fossil but a larger sample of the fossil record of clades to estimate calibration densities empirically. Studies have shown that increasing the number of fossil constraints increases the accuracy of divergence time estimation.

===Tip calibration===
Sometimes referred to as tip dating, tip calibration is a method of molecular clock calibration in which fossils are treated as taxa and placed on the tips of the tree. This is achieved by creating a matrix that includes a molecular dataset for the extant taxa along with a morphological dataset for both the extinct and the extant taxa. Unlike node calibration, this method reconstructs the tree topology and places the fossils simultaneously. Molecular and morphological models work together simultaneously, allowing morphology to inform the placement of fossils. Tip calibration makes use of all relevant fossil taxa during clock calibration, rather than relying on only the oldest fossil of each clade. This method does not rely on the interpretation of negative evidence to infer maximum clade ages.

=== Expansion calibration ===
Demographic changes in populations can be detected as fluctuations in historical coalescent effective population size from a sample of extant genetic variation in the population using coalescent theory. Ancient population expansions that are well documented and dated in the geological record can be used to calibrate a rate of molecular evolution in a manner similar to node calibration. However, instead of calibrating from the known age of a node, expansion calibration uses a two-epoch model of constant population size followed by population growth, with the time of transition between epochs being the parameter of interest for calibration. Expansion calibration works at shorter, intraspecific timescales in comparison to node calibration, because expansions can only be detected after the most recent common ancestor of the species in question. Expansion dating has been used to show that molecular clock rates can be inflated at short timescales (&lt; 1 MY) due to incomplete fixation of alleles, as discussed below

===Total evidence dating===
This approach to tip calibration goes a step further by simultaneously estimating fossil placement, topology, and the evolutionary timescale. In this method, the age of a fossil can inform its phylogenetic position in addition to morphology. By allowing all aspects of tree reconstruction to occur simultaneously, the risk of biased results is decreased. This approach has been improved upon by pairing it with different models. One current method of molecular clock calibration is total evidence dating paired with the fossilized birth-death (FBD) model and a model of morphological evolution. The FBD model is novel in that it allows for &quot;sampled ancestors&quot;, which are fossil taxa that are the direct ancestor of a living taxon or lineage. This allows fossils to be placed on a branch above an extant organism, rather than being confined to the tips.

===Methods===
Bayesian methods can provide more appropriate estimates of divergence times, especially if large datasets—such as those yielded by phylogenomics—are employed.

==Non-constant rate of molecular clock==
Sometimes only a single divergence date can be estimated from fossils, with all other dates inferred from that. Other sets of species have abundant fossils available, allowing the hypothesis of constant divergence rates to be tested. DNA sequences experiencing low levels of negative selection showed divergence rates of 0.7–0.8% per Myr in bacteria, mammals, invertebrates, and plants. In the same study, genomic regions experiencing very high negative or purifying selection (encoding rRNA) were considerably slower (1% per 50 Myr).

In addition to such variation in rate with genomic position, since the early 1990s variation among taxa has proven fertile ground for research too, even over comparatively short periods of evolutionary time (for example mockingbirds). Tube-nosed seabirds have molecular clocks that on average run at half speed of many other birds, possibly due to long generation times, and many turtles have a molecular clock running at one-eighth the speed it does in small mammals, or even slower. Effects of small population size are also likely to confound molecular clock analyses. Researchers such as Francisco J. Ayala have more fundamentally challenged the molecular clock hypothesis. According to Ayala&#x27;s 1999 study, five factors combine to limit the application of molecular clock models:

* Changing generation times (If the rate of new mutations depends at least partly on the number of generations rather than the number of years)
* Population size (Genetic drift is stronger in small populations, and so more mutations are effectively neutral)
* Species-specific differences (due to differing metabolism, ecology, evolutionary history, ...)
* Change in function of the protein studied (can be avoided in closely related species by utilizing non-coding DNA sequences or emphasizing silent mutations)
* Changes in the intensity of natural selection.

Molecular clock users have developed workaround solutions using a number of statistical approaches including maximum likelihood techniques and later Bayesian modeling. In particular, models that take into account rate variation across lineages have been proposed in order to obtain better estimates of divergence times. These models are called relaxed molecular clocks because they represent an intermediate position between the &#x27;strict&#x27; molecular clock hypothesis and Joseph Felsenstein&#x27;s many-rates model and are made possible through MCMC techniques that explore a weighted range of tree topologies and simultaneously estimate parameters of the chosen substitution model. It must be remembered that divergence dates inferred using a molecular clock are based on statistical inference and not on direct evidence.

The molecular clock runs into particular challenges at very short and very long timescales. At long timescales, the problem is saturation. When enough time has passed, many sites have undergone more than one change, but it is impossible to detect more than one. This means that the observed number of changes is no longer linear with time, but instead flattens out. Even at intermediate genetic distances, with phylogenetic data still sufficient to estimate topology, signal for the overall scale of the tree can be weak under complex likelihood models, leading to highly uncertain molecular clock estimates.

At very short time scales, many differences between samples do not represent fixation of different sequences in the different populations. Instead, they represent alternative alleles that were both present as part of a polymorphism in the common ancestor. The inclusion of differences that have not yet become fixed
leads to a potentially dramatic inflation of the apparent rate of the molecular clock at very short timescales.

==Uses==
The molecular clock technique is an important tool in molecular systematics, macroevolution, and phylogenetic comparative methods. Estimation of the dates of phylogenetic events, including those not documented by fossils, such as the divergences between living taxa has allowed the study of macroevolutionary processes in organisms that had limited fossil records. Phylogenetic comparative methods rely heavily on calibrated phylogenies.

<text>The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (, MEAE) is the ministry of the Government of France that handles France&#x27;s foreign relations. Since 1855, its headquarters have been located at 37 Quai d&#x27;Orsay, close to the National Assembly. The term Quai d&#x27;Orsay is often used as a metonym for the ministry. Its cabinet minister, the Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs () is responsible for the foreign relations of France. The current officeholder, Jean-Noël Barrot, was appointed in September 2024.

In 1547, royal secretaries became specialised, writing correspondence to foreign governments and negotiating peace treaties. The four French secretaries of state where foreign relations were divided by region, in 1589, became centralised with one becoming first secretary responsible for international relations. The Ancien Régime position of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs became Foreign Minister around 1723; it was renamed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1791 in the aftermath of early stages of the French Revolution. All ministerial positions were abolished in 1794 by the National Convention and reestablished with the Directory.

For a brief period in the 1980s from 1984 to 1986, the office was retitled Minister for External Relations. , it is designated as Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs and occupied by Stéphane Séjourné, who is assisted by Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Secretary of State for Development and International Partnerships, and Jean-Noël Barrot, Minister Delegate for Europe, and Franck Riester, Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade, Economic Attractiveness, Francophonie and French Nationals Abroad.

== Central administration ==

There are multiple services under its authority, along with that of some other ministers. Under the authority of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Development, that of Cooperation and European Affairs, and that of Foreign and European Affairs, there are numerous services directly related to the ministers. Here is a list of those services.
* The ministers&#x27; cabinet
* The office of cabinets, which gathers a personnel in charge of the administrative and logistics aspects of the three ministers&#x27; cabinets
* The budget control service (&quot;CBCM&quot;)
* General inspection of foreign affairs (&quot;IGAE&quot;)
* The prospective office (&quot;DP&quot;)
* The Protocole, upon which the President&#x27;s protocol cell relies
* The Crisis management Department (&quot;CDC&quot;)

Leonardo&#x27;s manufacturing facilities in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco, near Naples, Italy, produce the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage and tail sections. Aircraft wings are assembled at Sogerma in Bordeaux in western France by Airbus France. Final assembly, flight-testing, certification and deliveries are the responsibility of ATR in Toulouse, France.

==History==

=== 1980s ===
During the 1960s and 1970s, European aircraft manufacturers had, for the most part, undergone considerable corporate restructuring, including mergers and consolidations, as well as moved towards collaborative multi-national programmes, such as the newly launched Airbus A300. In line with this trend towards intra-European cooperation, French aerospace company Aérospatiale and Italian aviation conglomerate Aeritalia commenced discussions on the topic of working together to develop an all-new regional airliner. Prior to this, both companies had been independently conducting studies for their own aircraft concepts, the &quot;AS 35&quot; design in the case of Aerospatiale and the &quot;AIT 230&quot; for Aeritalia, to conform with demand within this sector of the market as early as 1978.

On 4 November 1981, a formal Cooperation Agreement was signed by Aeritalia chairman Renato Bonifacio and Aérospatiale chairman Jacques Mitterrand in Paris, France. This agreement signaled not only the merger of their efforts but of their separate concept designs together into a single complete aircraft design for the purpose of pursuing its development and manufacture as a collaborative joint venture. The consortium targeted a similar unit cost but a fuel consumption over a sector, nearly half the required by its 40-50 seat competitors, the British Aerospace HS.748 and Fokker F.27, and planned a 58-seat ATR XX stretch.

This agreement served not only as the basis and origins of the ATR company, but also as the effective launch point of what would become the fledgling firm&#x27;s first aircraft, which was designated as the &quot;ATR 42&quot;. By 1983, ATR&#x27;s customer services division has been set up, readying infrastructure worldwide to provide support for ATR&#x27;s upcoming aircraft to any customer regardless of location.

On 16 August 1984, the first model of the type, known as the &quot;ATR 42–200&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Toulouse Airport, France. During September 1985, both the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Italian Italian Civil Aviation Authority awarded type certification for the type, clearing it to commence operational service. On 3 December 1985, the first production aircraft, designated as the &quot;ATR 42-300&quot;, was delivered to French launch customer Air Littoral; the first revenue service was performed later that same month. During January 1986, already confident of the ATR 42&#x27;s success and of the demand for an enlarged version of the aircraft, ATR announced that the launch of a programme to develop such an aircraft, which was designated as the ATR 72 to reflect its increased passenger capacity.

During 1988, the 200th ATR was delivered to Thai Airways. During September 1989, it was announced that ATR had achieved its original target of 400 sales of the ATR. That same year, deliveries of the enlarged ATR 72 commenced; shortly thereafter, it became common for both types to be ordered together. Since the smaller ATR 42 is assembled on the same production line as the ATR 72, along with sharing the majority of subsystems, components, and manufacturing techniques, the two types support each other to remain in production. This factor may have been crucial as, by 2015, the ATR 42 was the only 50-seat regional aircraft that was still being manufactured.

=== 1990s ===
During September 1992, the 300th ATR was delivered to Finnish airline Karair.
The 500th ATR was delivered to American Eagle, USA on 5 September 1997.

In order to maintain a technological edge on the highly competitive market for regional airliners during the 1990s, several modifications and improved versions of the ATR 42 were progressively introduced. The initial ATR 42-300 model remained in production until 1996, while the first upgraded (and broadly similar) model, designated as the &quot;ATR 42-320&quot;, was also produced until 1996. The -320 variant principally differed in that it was powered by a pair of the more-powerful PW121 engines, giving it improved performance over the 300. Another variant, the &quot;ATR 42-300QC&quot;, was a dedicated &#x27;quick-change&#x27; (convertible) freight/passenger version of the standard −300 series.

The next major production version was the &quot;ATR 42−500&quot; series, the development of which having been originally announced on 14 June 1993. Performing its maiden flight on 16 September 1994, and awarded certification by the British Civil Aviation Authority and France&#x27;s (DGCA) during July 1995; the -500 model was an upgraded aircraft, equipped with new PW127 engines, new six-bladed propellers, improved hot and high performance, increased weight capacity and an improved passenger cabin. On 31 October 1995, the first ATR 42-500 was delivered to Italian operator Air Dolomiti; on 19 January 1996, the first revenue service to be performed by the type was conducted. In addition to new aircraft models, various organisational changes were also implemented. On 10 July 1998, ATR launched its new Asset Management Department.

=== 2000s ===
On 28 April 2000, the 600th ATR, an ATR 72-500, was delivered to Italian operator Air Dolomiti.
The 700th aircraft, an ATR 72-500, was delivered to Indian airline Simplify Deccan, on 8 September 2006.

In June 2001, EADS and Alenia Aeronautica, ATR&#x27;s parent companies, decided to reinforce their partnership, regrouping all industrial activities related to regional airliners underneath the ATR consortium. On 3 October 2003, ATR became one of the first aircraft manufacturers to be certified under ISO 9001-2000 and EN/AS/JISQ 9100, the worldwide quality standard for the aeronautics industry. During July 2004, ATR and Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer announced a cooperation agreement on the AEROChain Portal for the purpose of delivering improved customer service. During April 2009, ATR announces the launch of its &#x27;Door-2-Door&#x27; service as a new option in its comprehensive customer services range.

On 2 October 2007, ATR CEO Stéphane Mayer announced the launch of the −600 series aircraft; the ATR 42–600 and ATR 72–600 featured various improvements to increase efficiency, dispatch reliability, lower fuel burn and operating costs. While broadly similar to the earlier -500 model; differences include the adoption of improved PW127M engines, a new glass cockpit, and a variety of other minor improvements. Using the test registration &quot;F-WWLY&quot;, the prototype ATR 42–600 first flew on 4 March 2010.

=== 2010s ===

The 900th aircraft, an ATR 72-500, was delivered to Brazilian airline TRIP Linhas Aéreas on 10 September 2010. During 2011, Royal Air Maroc took delivery of the first ATR 72-600. The 1,000th aircraft was delivered to Spain&#x27;s Air Nostrum on May 3, 2012. On 15 June 2015, Japan Air Commuter signed a contract for ATR&#x27;s 1,500th aircraft.

On 1 February 2016, ATR signed a major agreement with Iran Air for 40 ATR 72-600s. The 1,300th ATR, an ATR 72-600, was delivered to NAC for operation by Irish airline Stobart Air on 14 June 2016; that same year, ATR delivered the first ever ATR 72-600 High Capacity aircraft (78 seats) to Cebu Pacific. In October 2016, Christian Scherer was appointed CEO.

In 2017, ATR celebrated its 35th anniversary. On 1 February, ATR and Sweden&#x27;s BRA performed the first ATR biofuel flight. During August 2017, US regional carrier Silver Airways signed a letter of intent for up to 50 ATR 42, a return in the continental US market since 1997 when American Airlines converted 12 ATR 72 options, due to the rise of regional jets and the American Eagle Flight 4184 crash in 1994. ATR lowered its output to 80 deliveries a year from 2017 and boasts a nearly three-year backlog after FedEx Express&#x27; November 2017 order. In 2017, ATR booked 113 firm orders and 40 options, and delivered 80 aircraft: 70 new ATR 72-600s, 8 new ATR 42-600s and 2 second hand ATRs.

By April 2018, the fleet was flying more than 5,000 times per day and had operated 30 million flight hours. By the end of June 2018, Leonardo had shipped the 1,500th ATR fuselage while nearly 1,700 airliners had been ordered; ATR reportedly led the turboprop regional airliner market since 2010 with a 75% share. The company&#x27;s aircraft were being operated in nearly 100 countries by 200 airlines and 30 million flights has been completed; it was also claimed that an ATR airliner takes off or lands every 8 seconds.

On 13 September, Scherer left its CEO role to replace Eric Schulz as Airbus&#x27; Chief Commercial Officer.
ATR replaced Scherer as its chief executive with Stefano Bortoli, president of ATR&#x27;s board and Leonardo aircraft&#x27;s senior vice-president for strategy and marketing.
At the end of October, the 1,500th ATR was delivered, an ATR 72-600 to Japan Air Commuter, after nearly 500 ATR 42s and more than 1,000 ATR 72s deliveries to over 200 operators in 100 countries. During 2018, ATR delivered 76 aircraft; the rate of production has held at a stable rate. The company opted to pursue a low-risk strategy, avoiding disruptive measures while opting to integrate relatively straightforward enhancements onto its aircraft, such as the Elbit Systems ClearVision wearable enhanced vision system.
===2020s===

In May 2022, ATR started studying an &quot;Evo&quot; hybrid-electric variant, aiming for a 2023 launch and service entry before 2030.
An optimized turboprop running on SAF would be supplemented by a mild hybridation during the take-off and climb phases for a 20% lower fuel burn.
Other improvements could include an eight-bladed propeller, thermal de-icing to replace the current pneumatic boots, a single lever FADEC for both engine and propeller and an aerodynamic clean-up of the secondary structures like the nacelle-wing junction.
A cabin revamp would save weight with recycled carbonfibre or bio-sourced resin and natural fibres.

On September 17, 2022, Stefano Bortoli was succeeded as CEO of ATR by Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, former president of NHIndustries and Senior Vice President Head of the NH90 Programme for Airbus Helicopters. On 21 June 2022, ATR completed its first flight as a 100% SAF-powered regional aircraft.

On November 13, 2024Turboprop aircraft maker ATR declared that it would scrap its development of a new model designed to take off and land on short runways and instead concentrate instead on its existing portfolio.

This project was undertaken in 2019, where it announced its plans to develop a unique version of its smallest model to squeeze in and out of airports with runways as short as 800 metres (2,600 feet).

==Products==

==Proposed aircraft==
; ATR 52: The ATR 52 was a 50-seat airliner proposed in parallel with the military ATR 52C
; ATR 52C: The ATR 52C was a military variant of the ATR 72-100 that included a rear ramp-type cargo door and strengthened cabin floor.
; ATR 82: Beginning in the mid-1980s, the company investigated a 86-seat derivative of the ATR 72. The ATR 82 would have been powered by turboprops, after an airline survey concluded that the market preferred turboprops instead of turbofans for aircraft that seated fewer than 90 passengers. The powerplants would have been chosen from the Allison AE2100G, Textron Lycoming LP512, or the General Electric GLC38. The aircraft would have a cruising speed as high as . The ATR-82 project (as it was dubbed) was suspended when Aero International (Regional) () was formed in early 1996.
; ATR 92: The company proposed a five-to-six abreast, 95–105 seat airliner at the 1988 Farnborough Air Show. The aircraft would have cruised at , and it would have been powered by a turbofan, high-speed turboprop, or an unducted fan.
; ATR stretch: In 2007, as a response to the Q400X proposal, ATR floated the idea of a 90–99 seater stretch. As of 2009, it was considered part of the future -900 series ATR family. In 2011, the 90-seater was proposed to shareholders. As of 2012, a new clean-sheet design was considered in the 90-seat segment, for a 2017 launch.

As of 2017, development of a 90-seater for an expected demand of 2,000–2,500 units over 20 years was expected to cost more than $5bn. Fuel burn would need to be reduced by at least 30%, and the unit price would need to stay in the low-to-mid-$20m range, below small jets.
Leonardo preferred a clean-sheet 90-100 seater with new turboprops, wings and cockpit available soon but Airbus favoured a medium-term introduction with disruptive hybrid electric engines, structural advanced materials and automation.
In January 2018, Leonardo abandoned the 100-seater prospect, favouring existing ATR 42 and 72 models which dominate the turboprop market with a 75% share.

<text>Dillingen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Donau-Ries, Augsburg and Günzburg, and by the state of Baden-Württemberg (district of Heidenheim).

== History ==
In ancient times the Danube river was a border between the Roman Empire and the Germanic tribes north of the river. The Roman camp of Phoebiana (now Faimingen) was a bridgehead crossing the Danube. There was an Apollo temple being one of the largest buildings north of the Alps in that time.

In medieval times the county of Dillingen was established. The counts of Dillingen ruled from the 10th to the 13th century, then (1258) the territory was turned over to the Prince-Bishops of Augsburg, who gained several villages for their clerical state, hence subdividing the region into several patches, which were dissolved in the early 19th century. In 1804 Dillingen and its area became part of the state of Bavaria.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former district of Dillingen (which had existed since 1804) with the western half of the former district of Wertingen. The city of Dillingen lost its status as a district-free city and became the capital of the newly established district.

== Geography ==
The district is crossed by the river Danube, which enters the district in the southwest and leaves to the east. All cities in the district except for Wertingen are located along the Danube.

== Coat of arms ==
The white lion was part of the arms of the medieval county of Dillingen. The black lion in the middle is taken from the arms of the dissolved district of Wertingen. The fleur-de-lis is from the arms of the city of Dillingen.
