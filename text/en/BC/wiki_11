<text>Delirious? (formerly known as The Cutting Edge Band) were an English contemporary Christian band. For the majority of their career, the lineup featured Martin Smith on vocals and guitar, Stu G (full name Stuart Garrard) on guitar and backing vocals, Jon Thatcher on bass guitar, Tim Jupp on keys and piano, and Stew Smith on drums and percussion. Paul Evans took over as drummer for the band&#x27;s final two years.

Delirious?&#x27; 1994 song &quot;I Could Sing of Your Love Forever&quot; has been called a &quot;modern worship classic&quot;. Other well-known songs by the band include &quot;Did You Feel the Mountains Tremble?&quot;, &quot;Rain Down&quot;, and &quot;Majesty&quot;.

The Cutting Edge Band had various members from 1992 to 1996, before becoming a full-time band with an established lineup and renaming themselves to Delirious?. From 1997 to 2001, the band focused on a mainstream audience, with several singles reaching the top-twenty in the UK. The band shifted towards CCM from 2003 to 2009, although occasional singles were still released.

During their final years, Delirious? began to focus on humanitarian issues in their music, and Martin Smith and Stu G started charities. Drummer Stew Smith left the band at the end of April 2008, and in a press release in July that same year, it was announced that the band would embark on an indefinite and possibly permanent hiatus. Delirious? performed their final concert in November 2009.

==History==
===Origins: The Cutting Edge Band (1992–1996)===
The origins of Delirious? stretch back to 1992. The band began life as a collection of musicians, known simply as &#x27;The Cutting Edge Band&#x27;. The group&#x27;s function was to be a Christian worship band for a youth outreach event called &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, instigated by the Arun Community Church in Littlehampton, West Sussex. The first members were Tim Jupp and Martin Smith, who became friends while working together at a recording studio. There they decided to form a band. Jupp had previously released an instrumental album titled &quot;Hooked On Ishmael&quot;. Originally, Jupp fronted the band, which also contained youth worker and drummer Stew Smith. Several different musicians filled the role of guitarist and bass player. The events became popular via word-of-mouth, leading the band to play at other &#x27;Cutting Edge&#x27; events along the south coast of England – monthly events in Portsmouth and Southampton. The events in Portsmouth only lasted a year but the events in Central Hall, Southampton were to run for three years, the duration of the Cutting Edge events. The group remained as the house band for Cutting Edge for several years, and they began to record and release the &#x27;Cutting Edge&#x27; cassette tapes. The turnout at the events grew so much that the regular venue (a local school hall) had to be replaced with the school&#x27;s sports hall, whilst the organizers had to charge a small fee to control the numbers attending. Similar challenges took place at the Central Hall in Southampton where up to 1200 people would gather each month. In 1996, an event was held in the open air, on the green next to Littlehampton&#x27;s beach. An estimated 4000 people attended, while Channel 4 filmed it for a documentary.

The band were able to release their increasingly popular material thanks to lead singer Martin Smith and keyboardist Tim Jupp&#x27;s roles as recording engineers and producers at a local recording studio. During this period, the lineup of the band began to take shape. Permanent guitar duties were taken up by Stu G shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s first EP, whilst Jon Thatcher became permanent bassist for the band&#x27;s fourth release, &#x27;Cutting Edge Fore&#x27;. In total, four EPs were released under the &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; name, in addition to a solo EP from guitarist Stu Garrard, which featured the entire band. Many of the band&#x27;s most famous songs were written and recorded during this time, including possibly their most famous: &#x27;I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever.&#x27; Others included &#x27;The Happy Song&#x27;, &#x27;Lord, You Have My Heart&#x27;, &#x27;Thank You For Saving Me&#x27;, &#x27;Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble?&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;ve Found Jesus&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;m Not Ashamed&#x27;, &#x27;Find Me In The River&#x27;, &#x27;Shout To The North&#x27;, &#x27;All I Want Is You&#x27; and &#x27;Obsession&#x27;. The music became well known in Christian circles, and demand grew for recordings. By 1996, they had sold over seventy thousand EPs by mail order. These EPs were later released as two albums in the UK, and one double album in the US. A similar composite edition of &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; was released to retail and achieved &#x27;Gold&#x27; status in Canada.

===Taking the band full-time: &quot;King of Fools&quot; &amp; early success (1997–1998)===
The turning point came in 1995 when Martin, his wife Anna and Jon Thatcher, were involved in a serious road accident. Jon and Anna were unhurt, but Martin was hospitalized for several weeks with broken bones. While in the hospital, Smith went through a period of depression, before making the decision to become a full-time musician. At this point, Delirious? was conceptually born. The band changed its name in January 1996, and they began to start work recording their new album.

They gained unexpected mainstream success in 1997 following the release of &quot;King of Fools&quot;, the first studio album released under their new name. &quot;King of Fools&quot; eventually went &#x27;Silver&#x27; in the United Kingdom, and Delirious? became one of the most popular and well-known Christian rock groups both in the UK and the United States. Songs such as &quot;Deeper&quot; gained anthemic status and still surface regularly at Christian youth events. Delirious? also released four singles to the mainstream UK Charts – &quot;White Ribbon Day&quot;, &quot;Deeper&quot; (twice), and &quot;Promise&quot;. &#x27;Deeper&#x27; and &#x27;Promise&#x27; both reached number twenty with very little radio airplay; For the majority of their career, &quot;Deeper&quot; was the band&#x27;s best-selling single with over thirty thousand copies sold. The album also contained the song &quot;History Maker&quot;, which arguably became one of the band&#x27;s most popular anthems. The song was played regularly at gigs throughout the rest of the band&#x27;s existence, and was eventually released as a successful UK single in 2010. During the summer of 1997, Stewart Smith and his wife lost their unborn baby through a miscarriage, inspiring the song &quot;Summer of Love&quot; on the &quot;DeEPer EP&quot;, a re-release of the &quot;Deeper&quot; single. The re-release attained number thirty-six on the UK Charts.

The group signed to EMI for its British releases but in 1997 the group signed to both Virgin and Sparrow Records for distribution in secular and Christian markets in the United States.

The success of the &quot;King of Fools&quot; album allowed the band to tour the UK for the first time comprehensively in 1997&#x27;s &#x27;d:tour&#x27;. Delirious? chose to tour without a support band, instead using a DJ and a large visual aspect to the performance. In 1998, the band released their second live album, &quot;d:tour&quot;, which featured many of the songs from the King Of Fools album in addition to some songs from the Cutting Edge period. It was recorded at Southampton Guildhall on the final night of the &#x27;d:tour&#x27;.

===First mainstream push: &quot;Mezzamorphis&quot; &amp; &quot;Glo&quot; (1999–2000)===
After a brief hiatus, the 1999 album &quot;Mezzamorphis&quot; attained number 25 in the UK mainstream album charts (number two in the independent section), and soon became certified silver in the UK. During this time, the band found resistance in the mainstream due to their &quot;Christian&quot; label, despite widespread critical acclaim in the music press. However, the work was aimed at a &quot;secular&quot; audience, causing many former fans to shun the album and claiming that Delirious? had &quot;sold out&quot; to mainstream markets.

Several singles from &quot;Mezzamorphis&quot; gained some British chart success. For example, the first single, &quot;See The Star&quot;, peaked at number sixteen on the charts (a career high for the band), following an appearance on television show The Big Breakfast. Despite the success of the single, the song choice was slightly controversial as it was arguably one of the weaker songs on the record.

The second single, &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot;, subsequently reached number eighteen. In the US, &quot;Gravity&quot; was chosen over &quot;See the Star&quot; as lead radio single for promotion.

Exactly one year later, in 2000, the band released &quot;Glo&quot; (short for &quot;glorious&quot;). This album was the number one seller for eight months. Several songs from the album, while not being released as actual singles, gained immense popularity in the Christian-music world, most notably the guitar-driven &quot;My Glorious&quot; and the more introspective &quot;Jesus&#x27; Blood&quot;. The track &quot;Investigate&quot; eventually became a favourite concert closer for the band. That year, Delirious? toured the US and appeared to an audience of 55,000 at the Creation Festival.

===Second mainstream push: &quot;Audio Lessonover?&quot; (2001–2002)===
The second attempted mainstream album, &quot;Audio Lessonover?&quot; (an anagram of &#x27;Radio One Loves Us&#x27;) was released in 2001. The band hired well known music producer Chuck Zwicky (Semisonic, Madonna). Zwicky wanted to go with a more stripped-down sound than the sonically layered Mezzamorphis and Glo. The band noted that there were tense and strained moments during the Audio Lessonover recording sessions, but in the end it stretched them as musicians and as a band. The first single &quot;Waiting For The Summer&quot; reached number twenty-six on the charts, hindered by limited radio airplay. This led to a planned second single, &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, being cancelled. Critically, the record itself received less favourable reviews in comparison to their previous three albums, whilst commercial album sales were also lower.

Again they received criticism for &quot;selling out&quot; to achieve success in mainstream markets. The band members are often questioned about the apparent critical &#x27;failure&#x27; of the album in interviews to this day.

That year the group took part in major tours with Bon Jovi and Matchbox Twenty.

The band&#x27;s first compilation, &quot;Deeper&quot;, was released in early 2002. It was a double album, consisting of many remastered classic songs from the band, in addition to tracks taken from previous work such as &quot;Glo&quot; and &quot;King of Fools&quot;. It also included several new versions of popular Cutting Edge tracks and a new song, &quot;Not Forgotten&quot;. Later that year, &quot;Audio Lessonover?&quot; was significantly edited by the band, and restyled as &quot;Touch&quot;. This new version of the album was intended for the North American market, although it was also made available in the UK. Some editions of &quot;Touch&quot; included a second disc featuring several live tracks, although these recordings were later incorporated into the band&#x27;s subsequent live album. &quot;&quot; was released towards the end of 2002, capping a year which had seen four full album releases from the band. A two-disc set, it featured many tracks which had previously been seen on their studio albums &quot;King of Fools&quot;, &quot;Mezzamorphis&quot;, &quot;Glo&quot;, &quot;Audio Lessonover?&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot;. A special edition was made available in an exclusive tin case.

===Return to roots: Post mainstream &#x27;trilogy&#x27; (2003–early 2008)===

In 2003, Delirious? released &quot;World Service&quot;, the first of what guitarist Stu G later described as &#x27;a trilogy&#x27;. Although this was more of a worship-oriented album, Delirious? released two singles to the German market: &quot;Inside Outside&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;. The former sold over twelve thousand copies, was number one in German radio station SWR3&#x27;s chart, and spent seven weeks in the German singles charts peaking at number seventy-two. Delirious? also released two free MP3 downloads on mp3.com, both topping the Guitar Rock charts (the first for a full month). The first MP3, &quot;Majesty (Here I Am)&quot;, hit number fifteen on the worldwide charts; the second, &quot;Rain Down&quot;, reached number twenty-eight. The two together had amassed over 500,000 listens/downloads after fifty days. Delirious?’s &quot;World Service&quot; is finding success in the United Kingdom and America as well. The band’s American single &#x27;Rain Down&#x27; has become its biggest multi-format hit since &quot;Deeper&quot;.

In 2005, long-term manager Tony Patoto parted company with the band, stating that he wanted a fresh challenge. The role was filled by band member and Delirious? keyboard player Tim Jupp.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;The Mission Bell&quot; was released in the UK in 2005. The album received very positive reviews, with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot;, and &quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; all praising The Mission Bell for &quot;Effectively stretching the boundaries of music&quot;. &quot;Paint The Town Red&quot; was released as a CD and iTunes single in the UK, entering the charts at number fifty-six. Several singles were released to CrossRhythms radio in the UK, all charting at number one for several weeks. The Mission Bell was nominated for the May 2007 Dove Awards, in the Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year Category.

Delirious? spent much of 2007 recording and working on their new album &quot;Kingdom of Comfort&quot; with producer Sam Gibson. It was released internationally in April 2008. This strategically coincided with the launch of the third version of their official website. The first single from the album was &quot;God Is Smiling&quot;.

===Retirement (mid-2008–2009)===

Prior to the release of &quot;Kingdom of Comfort&quot;, long-time drummer Stew Smith announced that he would be leaving the band in April 2008. He made his final appearance on a recording during the production of a live album and DVD while on tour in Brazil. The album was titled &quot;Unidos&quot;, and served as a collaboration project with André Valadão. It has been released in several countries, although it remains unreleased in the UK. Stew Smith&#x27;s final performance with the band took place at Sydney, Australia. His departure had a great impact upon the other members of the band, who came close to breaking up. However, Smith insisted that they should carry on. Paul Evans became the new drummer for Delirious? in May. He had previously played with Delirious? before when Stew Smith was unable to perform during a tour of the US.

On 6 July of the same year, the band announced via a press release that they would be &quot;taking a break&quot; at the end of 2009 to allow the band to focus on things close to them. Martin said that he wanted more time to spend with his family and devote more time to the CompassionArt project.

However, the band later announced that they would release the second single from &quot;Kingdom of Comfort&quot; to the UK charts in November, &quot;Love Will Find A Way&quot;, which was featured on &quot;Kingdom of Comfort&quot;. The single entered the charts at number thirty, but had dropped to number fifty five by the end of the first week.

Another live album and DVD, &quot;My Soul Sings&quot;, was recorded in Colombia during that year, and released in 2009. Additionally, a Greatest Hits album, &quot;History Makers&quot;, was released in November.

Delirious? finished their career by conducting a small farewell tour of Europe which concluded at the end of 2009. They played their final show in front of a sell-out crowd at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo on 29 November 2009, including a cameo performance from Stew Smith alongside Paul Evans.

===Post retirement (2010–present)===
The three-and-a-half-hour final show was filmed for a live album, DVD and Blu-ray package, titled &quot;Farewell Show - Live In London&quot;. It was released in April 2010.

In February 2010, a campaign to get History Maker into the UK charts for Easter began on social networking site Facebook. In response to this, the version from the final live album was released as a single on 28 March 2010. The two versions of &quot;History Makers&quot; reached as high as numbers 3 and 21 on the iTunes Store during the week, and the combined sales placed the single at number 6 in the midweek charts of 31 March 2010. The single rose two places, to chart at number four in the Official Singles chart on 4 April 2010. It also reached number one in the UK Indie Singles Chart.

Away from the band, many of the members have started work on, or announced, future projects that they intended to pursue after the band ended in November 2009. Lead singer Martin Smith intends pursuing the Compassionart project, the decision that triggered the split. Smith has written an autobiography titled &#x27;Delirious&#x27;, providing a detailed account of his life and time with the band. It was released in February 2011, alongside a similar autobiography from his wife Anna, which provides an alternative perspective on the band&#x27;s history. Smith has also been writing songs and leading worship at conferences around the world. A new website, launched to coincide with the autobiography, hints at future plans to &#x27;record&#x27; and &#x27;tour&#x27;.

Keyboard player Tim Jupp has been involved with a series of one-day Christian music festivals based mainly in West Sussex, England, called The Big Church Day Out Festival. Delirious? headlined the first annual event in May 2009. Another expanded event, held across three days, was held in May 2010.

Guitarist Stu G and bassist Jon Thatcher formed a new band with Jason Ingram as lead singer and Paul Mabury as drummer early in 2009. The band is called &#x27;One Sonic Society&#x27;, and they started work on their debut record in June 2009. As a group of four, the band released two EP&#x27;s. The first, &#x27;One&#x27;, was released in June 2010, whilst the second, &#x27;Sonic&#x27;, was released in October 2010. Following the release of &#x27;Sonic&#x27;, all references to Jon Thatcher were removed from the band website and official press releases, and it was confirmed by a source close to the band that Thatcher was no longer a member and that the band were now officially a three-piece. There have been no official comments on Thatcher&#x27;s departure from any of the band members, although the split is thought to have been an amicable one. As of March 2011, One Sonic Society have been recording &#x27;Society&#x27;, the third and final EP in the trilogy. A live album compiling the songs from the EP has also been planned.

Stu G also began writing and recording with many other artists around the world, and has continued to be a member of the Compassionart writing team. He has also toured extensively with other artists, most recently with Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith in 2011.

Thatcher has launched a creative solutions project called &#x27;Arkyard&#x27;. The services of the organisation have been since used by several notable clients including David Byrne, in addition to Delirious?, One Sonic Society and producer Sam Gibson.

Former drummer Stew Smith has already launched his graphic design company, &#x27;Smeezer&#x27;, which has designed advertising campaigns for Premier Percussion, clothing lines for high street store Fat Face, and the marketing of &#x27;The Big Church Day Out&#x27; festival.

However, in spite of all of these new projects, Martin Smith has hinted that the band may reunite some day.

==Naming confusion==
The question mark is part of the official name. On the band&#x27;s early albums, the final &quot;s&quot; before the question mark was rendered as a &quot;5&quot;. According to drummer/bandmember Stewart Smith, this occurred because the keyboard he was using at the time did not have the letter &quot;s&quot; and he improvised with the number 5 on the keypad—a convenient reflection of the band name. In some circles, therefore, the band&#x27;s name often appears as &quot;Deliriou5?&quot;. The band&#x27;s logo changed in 1999, and the glyph was replaced with a character that could be an &quot;s&quot; or a &quot;5&quot;. The name has always been spelled as &quot;Delirious?&quot; in official, non-graphical literature. This is consistent with the names of the band&#x27;s record company (Furious?) and publisher (Curious?).

==Delirious? live==
During their career, Delirious? played in over forty countries around the world. In the United Kingdom, they played gigs at venues such as Wembley Stadium, Hyde Park and the o2 Arena in London, Hampden Park stadium in Glasgow, Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Milton Keynes Bowl, Birmingham&#x27;s NEC Arena in addition to a performance on the main stage at Glastonbury Festival in 1999. They frequently headlined festivals such as Greenbelt, and conducted many tours around the country. They supported Bon Jovi, Matchbox 20 and Bryan Adams on their UK tours in 2001 and 2002. Prior to the band&#x27;s retirement, they played what were intended to be the first of many intimate &#x27;Living Room&#x27; gigs, exclusively for fans. The first of these was at the London Embassy in Mayfair, and limited to only one hundred tickets. The band were supported by Huey of the Fun Lovin&#x27; Criminals.

Delirious? also played many major shows in mainland Europe. In 2004, they headlined the Olympic celebrations in Omonia Square, Athens. In 2005, the band performed to an audience of 1.2 million people in Cologne, Germany.

The band also had an extensive touring schedule outside of Europe. In 2006, they played again to 1.2 million people, this time during a four date tour of India, with up to 400,000 people attending in one day. In the US, they played at such events as Acquire the Fire (an event hosted by Teen Mania) and Spirit West Coast. In 2007, they headlined their own twenty-four date tour across the country. In New Zealand they made appearances at the Parachute Music Festival, a four-day Christian music festival, the largest in the southern hemisphere.

=== Tours ===
Delirious? have performed many UK tours throughout their career, in addition to many high-profile tours of the US, Europe and other parts of the world. The full list of UK tours can be found below:

* These are only the UK tours, as Delirious? have played hundreds of shows around the globe.

During the d:tour in 1997, Delirious? travelled without a support act. During the History Makers tour in 2009, they supported themselves by playing a short set as &#x27;The Cutting Edge Band&#x27; before returning to the stage to perform as &#x27;Delirious?&#x27;. &#x27;The Cutting Edge Band&#x27; played the songs found on the four Cutting Edge tapes.

<text>The Lepidosauria (, from Greek meaning &quot;scaled lizards&quot;) is a subclass or superorder of reptiles, containing the orders Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. Squamata also includes lizards and snakes. Squamata contains over 9,000 species, making it by far the most species-rich and diverse order of non-avian reptiles in the present day. Rhynchocephalia was a formerly widespread and diverse group of reptiles in the Mesozoic Era. However, it is represented by only one living species: the tuatara (&quot;Sphenodon punctatus),&quot; a superficially lizard-like reptile native to New Zealand.

Lepidosauria is a monophyletic group (i.e. a clade), containing all descendants of the last common ancestor of squamates and rhynchocephalians. Lepidosaurs can be distinguished from other reptiles via several traits, such as large keratinous scales which may overlap one another. Purely in the context of modern taxa, Lepidosauria can be considered the sister taxon to Archelosauria, which includes Testudines (turtles), Aves (birds) and Crocodilia (crocodilians). Lepidosauria is encompassed by Lepidosauromorpha, a broader group defined as all reptiles (living or extinct) closer to lepidosaurs than to archosaurs.

==Evolution==
Lepidosauromorpha is thought to have split off from the ancestor of Archelosauria during the Permian period. The earliest members of Lepidosauromorpha date the Early Triassic. &quot;Sophineta&quot; from the Early Triassic may be the oldest known lepidosaur, but its exact placement is uncertain. The earliest rhynchocephalian, &quot;Wirtembergia&quot;, is known from the Middle Triassic. While the lepidosaur &quot;Megachirella&quot; may represent a stem-group squamate from the Middle Triassic the earliest modern members of the group are known from the Middle Jurassic. Squamates underwent a great radiation in the Cretaceous, while rhynchocephalians declined during the same time period.

==Description==
Extant reptiles are in the clade Diapsida, named for two pairs temporal fenestrae present on the skull behind the eye socket. Until recently, Diapsida was said to be composed of Lepidosauria and their sister taxa Archosauria. The subclass Lepidosauria is then split into Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. More recent morphological studies and molecular studies also place turtles firmly within Diapsida, even though they lack temporal fenestrations.

The reptiles in the subclass Lepidosauria can be distinguished from other reptiles by a variety of characteristics. Lepidosaurs are suggested to be distinguished from more primitive lepidosauromorphs by the development of a conch on the quadrate, allowing for the development of a tympanic membrane in the ear (a trait lost in the tuatara, but present in early rhynchocephalians), as well as the development of a subolfactory process on the frontal bones of the skull. 
The group Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenians. Squamata can be characterized by the reduction or loss of limbs. Snakes and legless lizards have evolved the complete loss of their limbs. The upper jaw of Squamates is movable on the cranium, a configuration called kinesis. This is made possible by a loose connection between the quadrate and its neighboring bones. Without this, snakes would not be able consume prey that are much larger than themselves. Amphisbaenians are mostly legless like snakes, but are generally much smaller. Three species of amphisbaenians have kept reduced front limbs and these species are known for actively burrowing in the ground. The tuatara and some extinct rhynchocephalians have a more rigid skull with a complete lower temporal bar closing the lower temporal fenestra formed by the fusion of the jugal and quadrate/quadratojugal bones, similar to the condition found in primitive diapsids. However early rhynchocephalians and lepidosauromorphs had an open lower temporal fenestra, without a complete temporal bar, so this is thought to be a reversion rather than retention. The temporal bar is thought to stabilise the skull during biting.

Male squamates have evolved a pair of hemipenises instead of a single penis with erectile tissue that is found in crocodilians, birds, mammals, and turtles. The hemipenis can be found in the base of the tail. The tuatara does not have a hemipenis, but instead has shallow paired outpocketings of the posterior wall of the cloaca.Second, most lepidosaurs have the ability to autotomize their tails. However, this trait has been lost on some recent species. In lizards and rhynchocephalians, fracture planes are present within the vertebrae of the tail that allow for its removal. Some lizards have multiple fracture planes, while others just have a single fracture plane. The regrowth of the tail is not always complete and is made of a solid rod of cartilage rather than individual vertebrae. In snakes, the tail separates between vertebrae and some do not experience regrowth.

Third, the scales in lepidosaurs are horny (keratinized) structures of the epidermis, allowing them to be shed collectively, contrary to the scutes seen in other reptiles. This is done in different cycles, depending on the species. However, lizards generally shed in flakes while snakes shed in one piece. Unlike scutes, lepidosaur scales will often overlap like roof tiles.

==Biology and ecology==

Squamates are represented by viviparous, ovoviviparous, and oviparous species. Viviparous means that the female gives birth to live young, Ovoviviparous means that the egg will develop inside the female&#x27;s body and Oviparous means that the female lays eggs. A few species within Squamata have the ability to reproduce asexually. The tuatara lays eggs that are usually about one inch in length and which take about 14 months to incubate.

While in the egg, the Squamata embryo develops an egg tooth on the premaxillary that helps the animal emerge from the egg. A reptile will increase three to twentyfold in length from hatching to adulthood. There are three main life history events that lepidosaurs reach: hatching/birth, sexual maturity, and reproductive senility.

Because gular pumping is so common in squamates, and is also found in the tuatara, it is assumed that it is an original trait in the group.

Most lepidosaurs rely on camouflage as one of their main defenses. Some species have evolved to blend in with their ecosystem, while others are able to change their skin color to blend in with their current surroundings. The ability to autotomize the tail is another defense that is common among lepidosaurs. Other species, such as the Echinosauria, have evolved the defense of feigning death.

===Hunting and diet===

Viperines can sense their prey&#x27;s infrared radiation through bare nerve endings on the skin of their heads. Also, viperines and some boids have thermal receptors that allow them to target their prey&#x27;s heat. Many snakes are able to obtain their prey through constriction. This is done by first biting the prey, then coiling their body around the prey. The snake then tightens its grip as the prey struggles, which leads to suffocation. Some snakes have fangs that produce venomous bites, which allows the snake to consume unconscious, or even dead, prey. Also, some venoms include a proteolytic component that aids in digestion. Chameleons grasp their prey with a projectile tongue. This is made possible by a hyoid mechanism, which is the contraction of the hyoid muscle that drives the tip of the tongue outwards.

Within the subclass Lepidosauria there are herbivores, omnivores, insectivores, and carnivores. The herbivores consist of iguanines, some agamids, and some skinks. Most lizard species and some snake species are insectivores. The remaining snake species, tuataras, and amphisbaenians, are carnivores. While some snake species are generalist, others eat a narrow range of prey - for example, Salvadora only eat lizards. The remaining lizards are omnivores and can consume plants or insects. The broad carnivorous diet of the tuatara may be facilitated by its specialised shearing mechanism, which involves a forward movement of the lower jaw following jaw closure.

While birds, including raptors, wading birds and roadrunners, and mammals are known to prey on reptiles, the major predator is other reptiles. Some reptiles eat reptile eggs, for example the diet of the Nile monitor includes crocodile eggs, and small reptiles are preyed upon by larger ones.

==Conservation==

The geographic ranges of lepidosaurs are vast and cover all but the most extreme cold parts of the globe. Amphisbaenians exist in Florida, mainland Mexico, including Baja California, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. The tuatara is confined to only a few rocky islands of New Zealand, where it digs burrows to live in and preys mostly on insects.

Climate change has led to the need for conservation efforts to protect the existence of the tuatara. This is because it is not possible for this species to migrate on its own to cooler areas. Conservationists are beginning to consider the possibility of translocating them to islands with cooler climates. The range of the tuatara has already been minimized by the introduction of cats, rats, dogs, and mustelids to New Zealand. The of the mammals from the islands where the tuatara still survives has helped the species increase its population. An experiment observing the tuatara population after the removal of the Polynesian rat showed that the tuatara expressed an island-specific increase of population after the rats&#x27; removal. However, it may be difficult to keep these small mammals from reinhabiting these islands.

Habitat destruction is the leading negative impact of humans on reptiles. Humans continue to develop land that is important habitat for the lepidosaurs. The clear-cutting of land has also led to habitat reduction. Some snakes and lizards migrate toward human dwellings because there is an abundance of rodent and insect prey. However, these reptiles are seen as pests and are often exterminated.

===Interactions with humans===

Snakes are commonly feared throughout the world. Bounties were paid for dead cobras under the British Raj in India; similarly, there have been advertised rattlesnake roundups in North America. Data shows that between 1959 and 1986 an average of 5,563 rattlesnakes were killed per year in Sweetwater, Texas, due to rattlesnake roundups, and these roundups have led to documented declines and local extirpations of rattlesnake populations, especially Eastern Diamondbacks in Georgia.

People have introduced species to the lepidosaurs&#x27; natural habitats that have increased predation on the reptiles. For example, mongooses were introduced to Jamaica from India to control the rat infestation in sugar cane fields. As a result, the mongooses fed on the lizard population of Jamaica, which has led to the elimination or decrease of many lizard species. Actions can be taken by humans to help endangered reptiles. Some species are unable to be bred in captivity, but others have thrived. There is also the option of animal refuges. This concept is helpful to contain the reptiles and keep them from human dwellings. However, environmental fluctuations and predatorial attacks still occur in refuges.

Reptile skins are still being sold. Accessories, such as shoes, boots, purses, belts, buttons, wallets, and lamp shades, are all made out of reptile skin. In 1986, the World Resource Institute estimated that 10.5 million reptile skins were traded legally. This total does not include the illegal trades of that year. Horned lizards are popularly harvested and stuffed. Some humans are making a conscious effort to preserve the remaining species of reptiles, however.

<doc id="241784" wikidata="Q421758" url="?curid=241784" title="Bromomethane">
<text>Bromomethane, commonly known as methyl bromide, is an organobromine compound with formula CH3Br. This colorless, odorless, nonflammable gas is produced both industrially and biologically. It is a recognized ozone-depleting chemical. According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, it has a global warming potential of 2. The compound was used extensively as a pesticide until being phased out by most countries in the early 2000s. From a chemistry perspective, it is one of the halomethanes. 

==Occurrence and manufacture==
Marine organisms are estimated to produce 56,000 tonnes annually. It is also produced in small quantities by certain terrestrial plants, such as members of the family Brassicaceae. 

In 2009, an estimated 24,000 tonnes of methyl bromide were produced. Its production was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, such that in 1983, production was nearly twice that of 2009 levels. It is manufactured by treating methanol with bromine in the presence of sulfur or hydrogen sulfide:
:6 CH3OH + 3 Br2 + S → 6 CH3Br + 2 H2O + H2SO4

==Uses==

Most methyl bromide is used for fumigation purposes, while some is used to manufacture other products. It is widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberries and almonds. Bromomethane is safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical roguing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is the only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (fork lift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out.

Bromomethane is also a precursor in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals such as neostigmine bromide, pancuronium bromide, propantheline bromide], pyridostigmine bromide, atropine derivatives, clidinium bromide, clobazam, demecarium bromide, glycopyrrolate, and vecuronium bromide. It is a precursor to many ordinary chemicals often as a methylating agent.

Bromomethane was once used in specialty fire extinguishers, prior to the advent of less toxic halons, as it is electrically non-conductive and leaves no residue. It was used primarily for electrical substations, military aircraft, and other industrial hazards. It was never as popular as other agents due to its high cost and toxicity. Bromomethane was used from the 1920s to the 1960s, and continued to be used in aircraft engine fire suppression systems into the late 1960s.

==Regulation==
Bromomethane is readily photolyzed in the atmosphere to release bromine radicals, which are far more destructive to stratospheric ozone than chlorine. As such, it is subject to phase-out requirements of the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances.

The London Amendment in 1990 added bromomethane to the list of ODS to be phased out. Phase-out began in the United States in 1993, manufactured amounts being capped at the 1991 level. All developed countries in the Montreal Protocol reduced both manufactured and imported amounts by 25% in 1999, 50% 2001, 75% 2003, 100% 2005. In 2003 the Global Environment Facility approved funds for a UNEP-UNDP joint project for methyl bromide total sector phase out in seven countries in Central Europe and Central Asia, which was due for completion in 2007.

===Australia===
In Australia, bromomethane is the preferred fumigant of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources for most organic goods imported into Australia. The department conducts methyl bromide fumigation certification for both domestic and foreign fumigators who can then fumigate containers destined for Australia. A list of alternative fumigants is available for goods imported from Europe (in what&#x27;s known as the BICON database), where methyl bromide fumigation has been banned. Alternatively, the department allows containers from Europe to be fumigated with methyl bromide on arrival to Australia.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, bromomethane is used as a fumigant for whole logs destined for export. Environmental groups and the Green Party oppose its use. In May 2011 the Environmental Risk Management Authority (ERMA) introduced new rules for its use which restrict the level of public exposure to the fumigant, set minimum buffer zones around fumigation sites, provide for notification to nearby residents and require users to monitor air quality during fumigations and report back to ERMA each year. All methyl bromide fumigations must use recapture technology by 2025.

===United States===
In the United States bromomethane is regulated as a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA; 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) and as a hazardous substance under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA; 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.), and is subject to reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA; 42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq.). The U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA; 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.). A 1998 amendment (P.L. 105-178, Title VI) conformed the Clean Air Act phase out date with that of the Montreal Protocol. While the Montreal Protocol severely restricted the use of bromomethane internationally, the United States has successfully lobbied for critical-use exemptions. Critical use exemptions allow the United States to continue using MeBr until it is scheduled to be completely phased out sometime in 2017.

===Chile===
Chile has phased out the use of bromomethane in traditional agriculture as of 2015, with exemption of the 100% pure formulation that is largely used for quarantine pest control and at pre-shipments of the fruit export industry.

==Alternatives==
Alternatives to bromomethane in the agricultural field are currently in use and further alternatives are in development, including propylene oxide and furfural. For Australia, a list of alternative fumigants is available for goods imported from Europe (in what&#x27;s known as the BICON database), where methyl bromide fumigation has been banned.

* Chloropicrin has been used in combination with bromomethane, and standalone is a common alternative fumigant. It has been widely used since its initial success against &quot;Verticillium dahliae&quot; in strawberry. It is a suitable alternative for fungicidal action but does not quite have BM&#x27;s nematicide or herbicide efficacy, and so is commonly combined with yet another fumigant.
* 1,3-Dichloropropene replaces some of both the fungicide and nematicide effects of BM, but is not a full-efficacy replacement.
* Methyl isothiocyanate is the breakdown product/a.i. of two applied products, metam sodium and granular dazomet. MITC does not redistribute through the soil as well as BM. Requires significantly more irrigation for activation. More strongly herbicidal than BM and so often used for that purpose alone. Much smaller doses stimulate weed germination.

An alternative to bromomethane for structural termite fumigation is sulfuryl fluoride, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. This is also used in exported agricultural commodities in order to prevent the spread of invasive species.

===Potential future alternatives===
* Iodomethane
* Propargyl bromide
* Ozone

==Health effects==
Brief exposure to high concentrations and prolonged inhalation of lower concentrations are problematic. Exposure levels leading to death vary from 1,600 to 60,000 ppm, depending on the duration of exposure (as a comparison exposure levels of 70 to 400 ppm of carbon monoxide cover the same spectrum of illness/death). Concentrations in the range of 60,000 ppm can be immediately fatal, while toxic effects can present following prolonged exposure to concentrations well under 1,000 ppm.

&quot;A TLV–TWA of 1 ppm (3.89 mg/m3) is recommended for occupational exposure to methyl bromide&quot;-ACGIH 8 hour time weighted average. Immediately Dangerous To Life or Health Concentration by NIOSH: &quot;The revised IDLH for methyl bromide is 250 ppm based on acute inhalation toxicity data in humans [Clarke et al. 1945]. This may be a conservative value due to the lack of relevant acute toxicity data for workers exposed to concentrations above 220 ppm. [Note: NIOSH recommends as part of its carcinogen policy that the &quot;most protective&quot; respirators be worn for methyl bromide at any detectable concentration.]&quot; Detectable concentration by Drager Tube is 0.5 ppm.

Respiratory, kidney, and neurological effects are of the greatest concern.

Treatment of wood packaging requires a concentration of up to 16,000 ppm.

NIOSH considers methyl bromide to be a potential occupational carcinogen as defined by the OSHA carcinogen policy [29 CFR 1990]. &quot;Methyl bromide showed a significant dose-response relationship with prostate cancer risk.&quot;

===Excessive exposure===
Expression of toxicity following exposure may involve a latent period of several hours, followed by signs such as nausea, abdominal pain, weakness, confusion, pulmonary edema, and seizures. Individuals who survive the acute phase often require a prolonged convalescence. Persistent neurological deficits such as asthenia, cognitive impairment, optical atrophy, and paresthesia are frequently present after moderate to severe poisoning. Blood or urine concentrations of inorganic bromide, a bromomethane metabolite, are useful to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in the forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage.

<doc id="241785" wikidata="Q3569763" url="?curid=241785" title="Women's Professional Basketball League">
<text>The Women&#x27;s Professional Basketball League (abbreviated WBL) was a professional women&#x27;s basketball league in the United States. The league played three seasons from the fall of 1978 to the spring of 1981. The league was the first professional women&#x27;s basketball league in the United States.

==Formation and 1978–79 season==

The WPBL was founded by sports entrepreneur Bill Byrne. The league began with a player draft held in Manhattan&#x27;s Essex House in July 1978, with eight teams participating. While few of the teams had firm commitments on playing locations (or team names, for that matter), the league planned to play a 34-game season with teams in Chicago, Houston, Iowa, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, New Jersey, New York City and Washington, D.C. Houston drafted Ann Meyers from UCLA, while New Jersey&#x27;s top choice Carol Blazejowski of Montclair State College said that she wanted to retain her amateur standing to be eligible to play in the 1980 Summer Olympics. Lusia Harris, a collegiate star at Delta State University, was selected by the Houston team, but was reluctant to commit to playing after hearing the $3,000 to $5,000 salaries estimated by the Minnesota franchise. With its last pick in the draft, the Cornets selected Uljana Semjonova, a 6-foot-11-inch player for the Soviet Union women&#x27;s national basketball team who would be inducted as an inaugural member of the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in the class of 1999, but would never play a game in the WBL. The New Jersey Gems selected Carol Blazejowski from Montclair State College, but she announced while on tour in Bulgaria with the U.S. national women&#x27;s team through her coach Maureen Wendelken that she had no intention of playing professionally and that her goal was to retain her amateur standing to be able to play for the U.S. at the 1980 Summer Olympics. Molly Bolin, who grew up in Moravia, Iowa, became the first player signed by any team in the WBL when she was signed by the Iowa Cornets.

The league played its first game on December 9, 1978, between the Chicago Hustle and the Milwaukee Does at the Milwaukee Arena, with the league&#x27;s inaugural game attracting four minutes of coverage in the previous night&#x27;s &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Walter Cronkite. Milwaukee mayor Henry Maier issued a proclamation likening this first game to the first professional football game, played in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and the first pro baseball game, played in Cincinnati. The Does had a crowd of 7,824 at the game, which saw the hometown team lose to Chicago 92–87, with Debra Waddy Rossow scoring 30 points to lead the Hustle.

The league was divided into two divisions, with Chicago, Milwaukee, Iowa and Minnesota Fillies playing in the Western Division, while the Dayton Rockettes, Houston Angels, New Jersey Gems and New York Stars were in the East. The eight initial teams paid $50,000 for their franchise, while the four teams to be added for the 1979–80 season were expected to pay $100,000, and $250,000 per team for each of four more teams in the following season. 

The league was able to arrange an All-Star game in 1979, which was played at the Felt Forum in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in front of 2,731 fans. The game was hastily arranged and inserted into the league&#x27;s schedule, using a court borrowed from the United States Military Academy at West Point, and forcing some players to have to make hectic travel arrangements to get to their next regular season game. The East beat the Midwest by a score of 112–99. Althea Gwyn of the New York Stars led the East with 19 points and 16 rebounds, while Chicago Hustle players Debra Waddy Rossow with 26 points and Rita Easterling with 19 points led the Midwest. Easterling, who also had 18 assists, was named the game&#x27;s most valuable player.

Behind 36 points by Paula Mayo, the Houston Angels defeated the Iowa Cornets on May 2, 1979, to take the league&#x27;s first championship, 111–104 in the final game of a best three-out-of-five competition.

==1979–80 season==

The league made it through its first season with all eight teams in operation, though the Dayton Rockettes had been taken over by the league in February 1979 and was to be relocated to either Indianapolis or Los Angeles. New franchises had been awarded to Dallas, New Orleans, San Francisco and St. Louis, while applications were received for potential franchises from Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.

The Eastern Division included the New Jersey Gems, New Orleans Pride, New York Stars, Philadelphia Fox, St. Louis Streak and Washington Metros. The Midwest Division included the Chicago Hustle, Iowa Cornets, Milwaukee Does and Minnesota Fillies. The Western Division included the California Dreams, Dallas Diamonds, Houston Angels and San Francisco Pioneers.

On January 30, 1980, the West defeated the East, 115–112, in the 1980 WBL All-Star Game.

On April 9, 1980, despite Iowa&#x27;s league-leading scorer Molly Bolin&#x27;s 36 points, the New York Stars held on to win game four of the finals 125–114, behind 27 points by Pearl Moore and 22 by Janice Thomas. Stars coach Dean Meminger called the game the &quot;culmination of a year of hard work&quot;. In what proved to be a harbinger of things to come, however, the Stars asked to go on a two-year hiatus not long after winning the title.

==1980–81 season and demise==

In a game scheduled in Chicago on March 21, 1981, players of the Minnesota Fillies, one of only three teams to play in all three seasons that the league was in existence, walked off the court before the starting lineups were announced in a game against the Chicago Hustle in a protest over unpaid salaries. Referees and team coach Terry Kunze tried to cajole the players back onto the court to play their game, but were unsuccessful. The team, which had been averaging 1,000 to 1,500 in attendance per game, were suspended from the WPBL by commissioner Sherwin Fischer, who called the walkout as &quot;very detrimental to the league&quot;. 

On February 7, 1981, Nebraska Wranglers player Connie Kunzmann was reported missing and was later pronounced dead. Police arrested Lance Tibke, who later pleaded guilty to her second degree murder.

The Nebraska Wranglers won the league&#x27;s 1980–81 title, defeating the Dallas Diamonds three games to two. In the fifth and final game, Rosie Walker led the victors with 39 points, while the Wranglers&#x27; defense held Nancy Lieberman of Dallas to 12 points, less than half of her season average.

Bill Byrne had founded the league hoping that the 1980 Summer Olympics would showcase the game&#x27;s stars and bring media and public attention to women&#x27;s basketball, but the United States-led boycott of the Moscow games only added to the league&#x27;s misfortunes.

By the fall of 1981, the league was showing what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;feeble flickers of life.&quot; That November, commissioner Dave Almstead announced the league had disbanded, having generated $14 million in losses in its three years on the court. Almstead, who had succeeded Fischer as league commissioner in May 1981, announced the league&#x27;s shutdown after trying unsuccessfully to contact the surviving eight teams&#x27; investors and team owners. Fischer, owner of the Chicago Hustle, insisted that he would field a team that would go barnstorming if the league went out of existence, and thought that teams would be fielded for a fourth season by Chicago, Nebraska and New Orleans. Some of the players were able to play professionally again in the 1984 Women&#x27;s American Basketball Association.

<text>Animatism is a term coined by British anthropologist Robert Marett in the context of his teleological theory of the evolution of religion. It refers to &quot;a belief in a generalized, impersonal power over which people have some measure of control&quot;. Marett argues that certain cultures believe &quot;people, animals, plants, and inanimate objects were endowed with certain powers, which were both impersonal and supernatural.&quot; &quot;Mana&quot;, Marett states, is a concentrated form of animatistic force found within any of these objects that confer power, strength, and success.

Animatism is a belief that inanimate, miraculous qualities exists in the natural world. It also talks about the belief that everything is infused with a life force giving each lifeless object personality or perception, but not a soul as in animism. It is a widespread belief among small-scale societies. In South Pacific regions, such as Melanesia and Polynesia, this belief comes in form of manaism, which is derived from mana

Many indigenous cultures believe in animatism. They believe that worshipping inanimate objects will drive them away from the evil forces around. These groups also believe that the inanimate objects they worship have mystical powers that are sent by God to help them on Earth.

Animatism laid the foundation for animism by introducing the notion of supernatural forces residing within lifeless entities, thus paving the way for the development of more complex belief systems.

This became Bang Nara () or Bang Nak () in Thai, but was changed to Narathiwat by King Rama VI in 1915. &quot;Narathiwat&quot;, from the Sanskrit (Nara+adhivāsa), means &quot;the residence of wise people&quot;.

==History==
Historically, Narathiwat was the part of the semi-independent Malay Sultanate of Patani, paying tribute to the Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom. After the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, the Sultanate of Patani gained full independence but returned under Thai control during the reign of King Rama I (r. 1782–1809), 18 years later, and in the early–1800s was divided into seven smaller kingdoms.

In 1909, Narathiwat was fully integrated into Siam as part of Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909 negotiated with the British Empire. Along with Yala, Narathiwat was then part of &quot;Monthon Pattani&quot;.

<text>Chlordane, or chlordan, is an organochlorine compound that was used as a pesticide. It is a white solid. In the United States, chlordane was used for termite-treatment of approximately 30 million homes until it was banned in 1988. Chlordane was banned 10 years earlier for food crops like corn and citrus, and on lawns and domestic gardens.

Like other chlorinated cyclodiene insecticides, chlordane is classified as an organic pollutant hazardous for human health. It is resistant to degradation in the environment and in humans/animals and readily accumulates in lipids (fats) of humans and animals. Exposure to the compound has been linked to cancers, diabetes, and neurological disorders.

==Production, composition and uses==
Technical chlordane development was by chance at Velsicol Chemical Corporation by Julius Hyman in 1948, during a search for possible uses of a by-product of synthetic rubber manufacturing. By chlorinating this by-product, persistent and potent insecticides were easily and cheaply produced. The chlorine atoms, 7 in the case of heptachlor, 8 in chlordane, and 9 in the case of nonachlor, surround and stabilize the cyclodiene ring and thus these compounds are referred to as cyclodienes. Other members of the cyclodiene family of organochlorine insecticides are aldrin and its epoxide, dieldrin, as well as endrin, which is a stereoisomer of dieldrin. Cyclodiene derives its name from hexachlorocyclopentadiene, a precursor in its production.

Hexachlorocyclopentadiene forms a Diels-Alder adduct with cyclopentadiene to give chlordene intermediate [3734-48-3]; chlorination of this adduct gives predominantly two chlordane isomers, α and β, in addition to other products such as &quot;trans&quot;-nonachlor and heptachlor. The β-isomer is popularly known as gamma and is more bioactive. The mixture that is composed of 147 components is called technical chlordane.

Chlordane appears as a white or off-white crystals when synthesized, but it was more commonly sold in various formulations as oil solutions, emulsions, sprays, dusts, and powders. These products were sold in the United States from 1948 to 1988.
Because of concern for harm to human health and to the environment, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) banned all uses of chlordane in 1983, except termite control in wooden structures (e.g. houses). After many reports of chlordane in the indoor air of treated homes, EPA banned the remaining use of chlordane in 1988. The EPA recommends that children should not drink water with more than 60 parts of chlordane per billion parts of drinking water (60 ppb) for longer than 1 day. EPA has set a limit in drinking water of 2 ppb.

Chlordane is very persistent in the environment because it does not break down easily. Tests of the air in the residence of U.S. government housing, 32 years after chlordane treatment, showed levels of chlordane and heptachlor 10-15 times the Minimal Risk Levels (20 nanograms/cubic meter of air) published by the Centers for Disease Control. It has an environmental half-life of 10 to 20 years.

==Origin, pathways of exposure, and processes of excretion==
 In the years 1948–1988 chlordane was a common pesticide for corn and citrus crops, as well as a method of home termite control. Pathways of exposure to chlordane include ingestion of crops grown in chlordane-contaminated soil, inhalation of air in chlordane-treated homes and from landfills, and ingestion of high-fat foods such as meat, fish, and dairy, as chlordane builds up in fatty tissue. The United States Environmental Protection Agency reported that over 30 million homes were treated with technical chlordane or technical chlordane with heptachlor. Depending on the site of home treatment, the indoor air levels of chlordane can still exceed the Minimal Risks Levels (MRLs) for both cancer and chronic disease by orders of magnitude. Chlordane is excreted slowly through feces, urine elimination, and through breast milk in nursing mothers. It is able to cross the placenta and become absorbed by developing fetuses in pregnant women. A breakdown product of chlordane, the metabolite oxychlordane, accumulates in blood and adipose tissue with age.

==Environmental impact==

Being hydrophobic, chlordane adheres to soil particles and enters groundwater only slowly, owing to its low solubility (0.009 ppm). It requires many years to degrade. Chlordane bioaccumulates in animals. It is highly toxic to fish, with an of 0.022–0.095 mg/kg (oral).

Oxychlordane (C10H4Cl8O), the primary metabolite of chlordane, and heptachlor epoxide, the primary metabolite of heptachlor, along with the two other main components of the chlordane mixture, &quot;cis&quot;-nonachlor and &quot;trans&quot;-nonachlor, are the main bioaccumulating constituents. &quot;trans&quot;-Nonachlor is more toxic than technical chlordane and &quot;cis&quot;-nonachlor is less toxic.

Chlordane and heptachlor are known as persistent organic pollutants (POP), classified among the &quot;dirty dozen&quot; and banned by the 2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.

==Health effects==
Exposure to chlordane/heptachlor and/or its metabolites (oxychlordane, heptachlor epoxide) are risk factors for type-2 diabetes, for lymphoma, for prostate cancer, for obesity, for testicular cancer, for breast cancer.

An epidemiological study conducted by the National Cancer Institute reported that higher levels of chlordane in dust on the floors of homes were associated with higher rates of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in occupants. Breathing chlordane in indoor air is the main route of exposure for these levels in human tissues. Currently, EPA has defined a concentration of 24 nanogram per cubic meter of air (ng/M3) for chlordane compounds over a 20-year exposure period as the concentration that will increase the probability of cancer by 1 in 1,000,000 persons. This probability of developing cancer increases to 10 in 1,000,000 persons with an exposure of 100 ng/m3 and 100 in 1,000,000 with an exposure of 1000 ng/m3.

The non-cancer health effects of chlordane compounds, which include diabetes, insulin resistance, migraines, respiratory infections, immune-system activation, anxiety, depression, blurry vision, confusion, intractable seizures as well as permanent neurological damage, probably affects more people than cancer. Trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane in serum of mothers during gestation has been linked with behaviors associated with autism in offspring at age 4–5. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has defined a concentration of chlordane compounds of 20 ng/m3 as the Minimal Risk Level (MRLs). ATSDR defines Minimal Risk Level as an estimate of daily human exposure to a dose of a chemical that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of adverse non-cancerous effects over a specific duration of exposure.

==Remediation==
Chlordane was applied under the home/building during treatment for termites and the half-life can be up to 30 years. Chlordane has a low vapor pressure and volatilizes slowly into the air of home/building above. To remove chlordane from indoor air requires either ventilation (Heat Exchange Ventilation) or activated carbon filtration. 
Chemical remediation of chlordane in soils was attempted by the US Army Corps of Engineers by mixing chlordane with aqueous lime and persulfate. In a phytoremediation study, Kentucky bluegrass and Perennial ryegrass were found to be minimally affected by chlordane, and both were found to take it up into their roots and shoots. Mycoremediation of chlordane in soil have found that contamination levels were reduced. The fungus &quot;Phanerochaete chrysosporium&quot; has been found to reduce concentrations of chlordane by 21% in water in 30 days and in solids in 60 days.

<text>Cresols (also known as hydroxytoluene, toluenol, benzol or cresylic acid) are a group of aromatic organic compounds. They are widely-occurring phenols (sometimes called &quot;phenolics&quot;) which may be either natural or manufactured. They are also categorized as [[methyl group|methyl]] [[phenol]]s. Cresols commonly occur as either solids or liquids because their melting points are generally close to room temperature. Like other types of phenols, they are slowly oxidized by exposure to air, and the resulting impurities often give the samples a yellow to brownish red tint. Cresols have an odor characteristic to that of other simple phenols, reminiscent to some of a &quot;coal tar&quot; smell. The name &quot;cresol&quot; is an adduct of phenol and their traditional source, creosote.

==Structure and production==
In its chemical structure, a molecule of cresol has a methyl group substituted onto the ring of phenol. There are three forms (isomers) of cresol: &quot;ortho&quot;-cresol (&quot;o&quot;-cresol), &quot;meta&quot;-cresol (&quot;m&quot;-cresol), and &quot;para&quot;-cresol (&quot;p&quot;-cresol). These forms occur separately or as a mixture, which can also be called cresol or more specifically, tricresol. About half of the world&#x27;s supply of cresols are extracted from coal tar. The rest is produced by hydrolysis of chlorotoluenes or the related sulfonates. Another method entails methylation of phenol with methanol over a solid acid catalyst, often comprising magnesium oxide or alumina. Temperatures above 300 °C are typical. Anisole converts to cresols under these conditions.

Another isomer of cresol is called Benzyl alcohol, or &quot;alpha&quot;-cresol (α-cresol). Benzyl alcohol has a hydroxy group inside a methyl group on the benzene ring.

== Applications ==
Cresols are precursors or synthetic intermediates to other compounds and materials, including plastics, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and dyes.

For cresol bactericides or disinfectants the mechanism of action is due to the destruction of bacterial cell membranes.

Most recently, cresols have been used to create a breakthrough in manufacturing carbon nanotubes at scale that are separated and not twisted, without additional chemicals that change the surface properties of the nanotubes.

===Commercial examples===
* Creolin, a 19th-century disinfectant.
* Carbolic soap, 19th-century.
* The original Lysol formulation, essentially a water solution of carbolic soap. &quot;Lysol&quot; has been used as a generic trademark to refer to such a cresol soap solution and remains used as such in some professional settings. The CAS number is 12772-68-8.

=== Derivatives ===
Derivatives of &quot;p&quot;-cresol include:
* Butylated hydroxytoluene, a common antioxidant

Derivatives of &quot;o&quot;-cresol include:
* Indo-1, a popular calcium indicator
* MCPA, (4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)acetic acid
* MCPB, 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)butanoic acid
* Mecoprop, (&quot;RS&quot;)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propanoic acid
* the amine atomoxetine, (3&quot;R&quot;)-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-3-(2-methylphenoxy)-3-phenylpropan-1-amine
* the diol mephenesin, 3-(2-methylphenoxy)propane-1,2-diol

Derivatives of &quot;m&quot;-cresol include:
* Amylmetacresol, an antiseptic
* Bevantolol, (&quot;RS&quot;)-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl] [2-hydroxy-3-(3-methylphenoxy)propyl]amine
* Bromocresol green
* Bupranolol, a non-selective beta blocker
* Chloro-&quot;m&quot;-cresol which is used as a household disinfectant
* Tolimidone, 5-(3-methylphenoxy)pyrimidin-2(1&quot;H&quot;)-one

==Health effects==
When cresols are inhaled, ingested, or applied to the skin, they can be very harmful. Effects observed in people include irritation and burning of skin, eyes, mouth, and throat; abdominal pain and vomiting; heart damage; anemia; liver and kidney damage; facial paralysis; coma; and death.

Breathing high levels of cresols for a short time results in irritation of the nose and throat. Aside from these effects, very little is known about the effects of breathing cresols, for example, at lower levels over longer times.

Ingesting high levels results in kidney problems, mouth and throat burns, abdominal pain, vomiting, and effects on the blood and nervous system.

Skin contact with high levels of cresols can burn the skin and damage the kidneys, liver, blood, brain, and lungs.

Short-term and long-term studies with animals have shown similar effects from exposure to cresols. No human or animal studies have shown harmful effects from cresols on reproduction.

It is not known what the effects are from long-term ingestion or skin contact with low levels of cresols.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 5 ppm (22 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average, while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends a limit of 2.3 ppm (10 mg/m3).

<text>1,2-Dibromoethane, also known as ethylene dibromide (EDB), is an organobromine compound with the chemical formula . Although trace amounts occur naturally in the ocean, where it is probably formed by algae and kelp, substantial amounts are produced industrially. It is a dense colorless liquid with a faint, sweet odor, detectable at 10 ppm. It is a widely used and sometimes-controversial fumigant. The combustion of 1,2-dibromoethane produces hydrogen bromide gas that is significantly corrosive.

==Preparation and use==
It is produced by the reaction of ethylene gas with bromine, in a classic halogen addition reaction:
:CH=CH + Br → BrCH–CHBr

Historically, 1,2-dibromoethane was used as a component in anti-knock additives in leaded fuels. It reacts with lead residues to generate volatile lead bromides, thereby preventing fouling of the engine with lead deposits.

===Pesticide===
It has been used as a pesticide in soil and on various crops. The applications were initiated after the forced retirement of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP). Most of these uses have been stopped in the U.S. It continues to be used as a fumigant for treatment of logs for termites and beetles, and for control of moths in beehives.

===Reagent===
1,2-Dibromoethane has wider applications in the preparation of other organic compounds including those carrying modified diazocine rings and vinyl bromide that is a precursor to some fire retardants.

In organic synthesis, 1,2-dibromoethane is used to brominate carbanions and to activate magnesium for certain Grignard reagents. In the latter process, 1,2-dibromoethane reacts with magnesium, producing ethylene and magnesium bromide, which are innocuous, exposing a more active portion of the magnesium particle to the substrate.

==Health effects==
1,2-Dibromoethane causes changes in the metabolism and severe destruction of living tissues. The known empirical LD50 values for 1,2-dibromoethane are 140 mg kg−1 (oral, rat), and 300.0 mg kg−1 (dermal, rabbit). 1,2-Dibromoethane is a known carcinogen, with pre-1977 exposure levels ranking it as the most carcinogenic substance on the HERP Index.

The effects on people of breathing high levels are not known, but animal studies with short-term exposures to high levels caused depression and collapse, indicating effects on the brain. Changes in the brain and behavior were also seen in young rats whose male parents had breathed 1,2-dibromoethane, and birth defects were observed in the young of animals that were exposed while pregnant. 1,2-Dibromoethane is not known to cause birth defects in humans. Swallowing has caused death at 40ml doses.

<doc id="241809" wikidata="Q243354" url="?curid=241809" title="Carbon disulfide">
<text>Carbon disulfide (also spelled as carbon disulphide) is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula and structure . It is also considered as the anhydride of thiocarbonic acid. It is a colorless, flammable, neurotoxic liquid that is used as a building block in organic synthesis. Pure carbon disulfide has a pleasant, ether- or chloroform-like odor, but commercial samples are usually yellowish and are typically contaminated with foul-smelling impurities.

== History ==

In 1796, the German chemist Wilhelm August Lampadius (1772–1842) first prepared carbon disulfide by heating pyrite with moist charcoal. He called it &quot;liquid sulfur&quot; (&quot;flüssig Schwefel&quot;). The composition of carbon disulfide was finally determined in 1813 by the team of the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1779–1848) and the Swiss-British chemist Alexander Marcet (1770–1822). Their analysis was consistent with an empirical formula of CS2.

==Occurrence, manufacture, properties==
Small amounts of carbon disulfide are released by volcanic eruptions and marshes. CS2 once was manufactured by combining carbon (or coke) and sulfur at 800–1000 °C.
:C + 2S → CS2

A lower-temperature reaction, requiring only 600 °C, utilizes natural gas as the carbon source in the presence of silica gel or alumina catalysts:
:2 CH4 + S8 → 2 CS2 + 4 H2S

The reaction is analogous to the combustion of methane.

Global production/consumption of carbon disulfide is approximately one million tonnes, with China consuming 49%, followed by India at 13%, mostly for the production of rayon fiber. United States production in 2007 was 56,000 tonnes.

===Solvent===
Carbon disulfide can dissolve a variety of nonpolar chemicals including phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, bromine, iodine, fats, resins, rubber, and asphalt.

=== Extraterrestrial ===
In March 2024, traces of CS2 were likely detected in the atmosphere of the temperate mini-Neptune planet TOI-270 d by the James Webb Space Telescope.

==Reactions==
Combustion of CS2 affords sulfur dioxide according to this ideal stoichiometry:
:CS2 + 3O2 → CO2 + 2SO2

===With nucleophiles===
For example, amines afford dithiocarbamates:
:2R2NH + CS2 → [R2NH2+][R2NCS2−]
Xanthates form similarly from alkoxides:
:RONa + CS2 → [Na+][ROCS2−]
This reaction is the basis of the manufacture of regenerated cellulose, the main ingredient of viscose, rayon, and cellophane. Both xanthates and the related thioxanthates (derived from treatment of CS2 with sodium thiolates) are used as flotation agents in mineral processing.

Upon treatment with sodium sulfide, carbon disulfide affords trithiocarbonate:
:Na2S + CS2 → [Na+]2[CS32−]

Carbon disulfide does not hydrolyze readily, although the process is catalyzed by an enzyme carbon disulfide hydrolase.

Compared to the isoelectronic carbon dioxide, CS2 is a weaker electrophile. While, however, reactions of nucleophiles with CO2 are highly reversible and products are only isolated with very strong nucleophiles, the reactions with CS2 are thermodynamically more favored allowing the formation of products with less reactive nucleophiles.

===Reduction===
Reduction of carbon disulfide with sodium affords sodium 1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate together with sodium trithiocarbonate:
: 4Na + 4CS2 → Na2C3S5 + Na2CS3

===Chlorination===
Chlorination of CS2 provides a route to carbon tetrachloride:
:CS2 + 3 Cl2 → CCl4 + S2Cl2

This conversion proceeds via the intermediacy of thiophosgene, CSCl2.

===Coordination chemistry===
CS2 is a ligand for many metal complexes, forming pi complexes. One example is CpCo(η2-CS2)(PMe3).

==Polymerization==
CS2 polymerizes upon photolysis or under high pressure to give an insoluble material called car-sul or &quot;Bridgman&#x27;s black&quot;, named after the discoverer of the polymer, Percy Williams Bridgman. Trithiocarbonate (-S-C(S)-S-) linkages comprise, in part, the backbone of the polymer, which is a semiconductor.

==Uses==
The principal industrial uses of carbon disulfide, consuming 75% of the annual production, are the manufacture of viscose rayon and cellophane film.

It is also a valued intermediate in chemical synthesis of carbon tetrachloride. It is widely used in the synthesis of organosulfur compounds such as xanthates, which are used in froth flotation, a method for extracting metals from their ores. Carbon disulfide is also a precursor to dithiocarbamates, which are used as drugs (e.g. Metam sodium) and rubber chemistry.

===Niche uses===

It can be used in fumigation of airtight storage warehouses, airtight flat storage, bins, grain elevators, railroad box cars, ship holds, barges, and cereal mills. Carbon disulfide is also used as an insecticide for the fumigation of grains, nursery stock, in fresh fruit conservation, and as a soil disinfectant against insects and nematodes.

It can also be used for the Barking dog reaction.

==Health effects==
Carbon disulfide has been linked to both acute and chronic forms of poisoning, with a diverse range of symptoms.

Concentrations of 500–3000 mg/m3 cause acute and subacute poisoning. These include a set of mostly neurological and psychiatric symptoms, called encephalopathia sulfocarbonica. Symptoms include acute psychosis (manic delirium, hallucinations), paranoic ideas, loss of appetite, gastrointestinal and sexual disorders, polyneuritis, myopathy, and mood changes (including irritability and anger). Effects observed at lower concentrations include neurological problems (encephalopathy, psychomotor and psychological disturbances, polyneuritis, abnormalities in nerve conduction), hearing problems, vision problems (burning eyes, abnormal light reactions, increased ophthalmic pressure), heart problems (increased deaths for heart disease, angina pectoris, high blood pressure), reproductive problems (increased miscarriages, immobile or deformed sperm), and decreased immune response.

Occupational exposure to carbon disulfide is also associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly stroke.

In 2000, the WHO believed that health harms were unlikely at levels below 100 μg/m3, and set this as a guideline level. Carbon disulfide can be smelled at levels above 200 μg/m3, and the WHO recommended a sensory guideline of below 20 μg/m3. Exposure to carbon disulfide is well-established to be harmful to health in concentrations at or above 30 mg/m3. Changes in the function of the central nervous system have been observed at concentrations of 20–25 mg/m3. There are also reports of harms to health at 10 mg/m3, for exposures of 10–15 years, but the lack of good data on past exposure levels make the association of these harms with concentrations of 10 mg/m3 findings uncertain. The measured concentration of 10 mg/m3 may be equivalent to a concentration in the general environment of 1 mg/m3.

===Environmental sources===
The primary source of carbon disulfide in the environment is rayon factories. Most global carbon disulfide emissions come from rayon production, as of 2008. Other sources include the production of cellophane, carbon tetrachloride, carbon black, and sulfur recovery. Carbon disulfide production also emits hydrogen sulfide.

, about 250 g of carbon disulfide is emitted per kilogram of rayon produced. About 30 g of carbon disulfide is emitted per kilogram of carbon black produced. About 0.341 g of carbon disulfide is emitted per kilogram of sulfur recovered.

Japan has reduced carbon disulfide emissions per kilogram of rayon produced, but in other rayon-producing countries, including China, emissions are assumed to be uncontrolled (based on global modelling and large-scale free-air concentration measurements). Rayon production is steady or decreasing except in China, where it is increasing, . Carbon black production in Japan and Korea uses incinerators to destroy about 99% of the carbon disulfide that would otherwise be emitted. When used as a solvent, Japanese emissions are about 40% of the carbon disulfide used; elsewhere, the average is about 80%.

Most rayon production uses carbon sulfide. One exception is rayon made using the lyocell process, which uses a different solvent; the lyocell process is not widely used, because it is more expensive than the viscose process. Cuprammonium rayon also does not use carbon disulfide.

===Historic and current exposure===
Industrial workers working with carbon disulfide are at high risk. Emissions may also harm the health of people living near rayon plants.

Concerns about carbon disulfide exposure have a long history. Around 1900, carbon disulfide came to be widely used in the production of vulcanized rubber. The psychosis produced by high exposures was immediately apparent (it has been reported with 6 months of exposure). Sir Thomas Oliver told a story about a rubber factory that put bars on its windows so that the workers would not jump out to their deaths. Carbon disulfide&#x27;s use in the US as a heavier-than-air burrow poison for Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrel also led to reports of psychosis. No systematic medical study of the issue was published, and knowledge was not transferred to the rayon industry.

The first large epidemiological study of rayon workers was done in the US in the late 1930s, and found fairly severe effects in 30% of the workers. Data on increased risks of heart attacks and strokes came out in the 1960s. Courtaulds, a major rayon manufacturer, worked hard to prevent publication of this data in the UK. Average concentrations in sampled rayon plants were reduced from about 250 mg/m3 in 1955–1965 to about 20–30 mg/m3 in the 1980s (US figures only?). Rayon production has since largely moved to the developing world, especially China, Indonesia and India.

Rates of disability in modern factories are unknown, . Current manufacturers using the viscose process do not provide any information on harm to their workers.

<text>Diborane(6), commonly known as diborane, is the chemical compound with the formula B2H6. It is a highly toxic, colorless, and pyrophoric gas with a repulsively sweet odor. Given its simple formula, borane is a fundamental boron compound. It has attracted wide attention for its electronic structure. Several of its derivatives are useful reagents.

== Structure and bonding ==

The structure of diborane has D2h symmetry. Four hydrides are terminal, while two bridge between the boron centers. The lengths of the B–Hbridge bonds and the B–Hterminal bonds are 1.33 and 1.19 Å respectively. This difference in bond lengths reflects the difference in their strengths, the B–Hbridge bonds being relatively weaker. The weakness of the B–Hbridge compared to B–Hterminal bonds is indicated by their vibrational signatures in the infrared spectrum, being ≈2100 and 2500 cm−1 respectively.

The model determined by molecular orbital theory describes the bonds between boron and the terminal hydrogen atoms as conventional 2-center 2-electron covalent bonds. The bonding between the boron atoms and the bridging hydrogen atoms is, however, different from that in molecules such as hydrocarbons. Each boron uses two electrons in bonding to the terminal hydrogen atoms and has one valence electron remaining for additional bonding. The bridging hydrogen atoms provide one electron each. The B2H2 ring is held together by four electrons forming two 3-center 2-electron bonds. This type of bond is sometimes called a &quot;banana bond&quot;.

B2H6 is isoelectronic with C2H62+, which would arise from the diprotonation of the planar molecule ethylene. Diborane is one of many compounds with such unusual bonding.

Of the other elements in group IIIA, gallium is known to form a similar compound digallane, Ga2H6. Aluminium forms a polymeric hydride, (AlH3)&quot;n&quot;; although unstable, Al2H6 has been isolated in solid hydrogen and is isostructural with diborane.

== Production and synthesis ==
Extensive studies of diborane have led to the development of multiple synthesis routes. Most preparations entail reactions of hydride donors with boron halides or alkoxides. The industrial synthesis of diborane involves the reduction of BF3 by sodium hydride (NaH), lithium hydride (LiH) or lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4):
: 8 BF3 + 6 LiH → B2H6 + 6 LiBF4
Lithium hydride used for this purpose must be very finely powdered to avoid the formation of a passivating lithium tetrafluoroborate layer on the reactant. Alternatively, a small amount of diborane product can be added to form lithium borohydride, which will react with the BF3 to produce more diborane, making the reaction autocatalytic. 

Two laboratory methods start from boron trichloride with lithium aluminium hydride or from boron trifluoride ether solution with sodium borohydride. Both methods result in as much as 30% yield: 
: 4 BCl3 + 3 LiAlH4 → 2 B2H6 + 3 LiAlCl4
: 4 BF3 + 3 NaBH4 → 2 B2H6 + 3 NaBF4

When heated with NaBH4, tin(II) chloride is reduced to elemental tin, forming diborane in the process:

Older methods entail the direct reaction of borohydride salts with a non-oxidizing acid, such as phosphoric acid or dilute sulfuric acid.
: 2 BH4− + 2 H+ → 2 H2 + B2H6
Similarly, oxidation of borohydride salts has been demonstrated and remains convenient for small-scale preparations. For example, using iodine as an oxidizer:
: 2 + → 2 NaI + + 

Another small-scale synthesis uses potassium borohydride and phosphoric acid as starting materials.

== Reactions ==

Diborane is a highly reactive and versatile reagent. 

===Air, water, oxygen===
As a pyrophoric substance, diborane reacts exothermically with oxygen to form boron trioxide and water:
: 2 B2H6 + 6 O2 → 2 B2O3 + 6 H2O (Δ&quot;H&quot;r = −2035 kJ/mol = −73.47 kJ/g)

Diborane reacts violently with water to form hydrogen and boric acid:
: B2H6 + 6 H2O → 2 B(OH)3 + 6 H2 (Δ&quot;H&quot;r = −466 kJ/mol = −16.82 kJ/g)

Diborane also reacts with alcohols similarly. For example, the reaction with methanol gives hydrogen and trimethylborate:
: B2H6 + 6 MeOH → 2 B(OMe)3 + 6 H2

===Lewis acidity===
One dominating reaction pattern involves formation of adducts with Lewis bases. Often such initial adducts proceed rapidly to give other products. For example, borane-tetrahydrofuran, which often behaves equivalently to diborane, degrades to borate esters. Its adduct with dimethyl sulfide is an important reagent in organic synthesis.

With ammonia diborane forms the diammoniate of diborane, DADB with small quantities of ammonia borane as byproduct. The ratio depends on the conditions.

===Hydroboration===
In the hydroboration reaction, diborane also reacts readily with alkenes to form trialkylboranes. This reaction pattern is rather general and the resulting alkyl borates can be readily derivatized, e.g. to alcohols. Although early work on hydroboration relied on diborane, it has been replaced by borane dimethylsulfide, which is more safely handled.

===Other===
Pyrolysis of diborane gives hydrogen and diverse boron hydride clusters. For example, pentaborane was first prepared by pyrolysis of diborane at about 200 °C. Although this pyrolysis route is rarely employed, it ushered in a large research theme of borane cluster chemistry.

Treating diborane with sodium amalgam gives NaBH4 and Na[B3H8]
When diborane is treated with lithium hydride in diethyl ether, lithium borohydride is formed:
: B2H6 + 2 LiH → 2 LiBH4
Diborane reacts with anhydrous hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide gas to give a boron halohydride:
: B2H6 + HX → B2H5X + H2 (X = Cl, Br)
Treating diborane with carbon monoxide at 470 K and 20 bar gives H3BCO.

== Reagent in organic synthesis ==
Diborane and its variants are central organic synthesis reagents for hydroboration. Alkenes add across the B–H bonds to give trialkylboranes, which can be further elaborated. Diborane is used as a reducing agent roughly complementary to the reactivity of lithium aluminium hydride. The compound readily reduces carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohols, whereas ketones react only sluggishly.

== History ==
Diborane was first synthesised in the 19th century by hydrolysis of metal borides, but it was never analysed. From 1912 to 1936, Alfred Stock, the major pioneer in the chemistry of boron hydrides, undertook his research that led to the methods for the synthesis and handling of the highly reactive, volatile, and often toxic boron hydrides. He proposed the first ethane-like structure of diborane. Electron diffraction measurements by S. H. Bauer initially appeared to support his proposed structure.

Because of a personal communication with L. Pauling (who supported the ethane-like structure), H. I. Schlessinger and A. B. Burg did not specifically discuss 3-center 2-electron bonding in their then classic review in the early 1940s. The review does, however, discuss the bridged D2h structure in some depth: &quot;It is to be recognized that this formulation easily accounts for many of the chemical properties of diborane...&quot;

In 1943, H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins, while still an undergraduate at Oxford, was the first to explain the structure and bonding of the boron hydrides. The article reporting the work, written with his tutor R. P. Bell, also reviews the history of the subject beginning with the work of Dilthey. Shortly afterwards, the theoretical work of Longuet-Higgins was confirmed in an infrared study of diborane by Price. 
The structure was re-confirmed by electron-diffraction measurement in 1951 by K. Hedberg and V. Schomaker, with the confirmation of the structure shown in the schemes on this page.

William Nunn Lipscomb Jr. further confirmed the molecular structure of boranes using X-ray crystallography in the 1950s and developed theories to explain their bonding. Later, he applied the same methods to related problems, including the structure of carboranes, on which he directed the research of future 1981 Nobel Prize winner Roald Hoffmann. The 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Lipscomb &quot;for his studies on the structure of boranes illuminating problems of chemical bonding&quot;.

Traditionally, diborane has often been described as electron-deficient, because the 12 valence electrons can only form 6 conventional 2-centre 2-electron bonds, which are insufficient to join all 8 atoms. However, the more correct description using 3-centre bonds shows that diborane is really electron-precise, since there are just enough valence electrons to fill the 6 bonding molecular orbitals. Nevertheless, some leading textbooks still use the term &quot;electron-deficient&quot;.

== Other uses ==
Because of the exothermicity of its reaction with oxygen, diborane has been tested as a rocket propellant. Complete combustion is strongly exothermic. However, combustion is not complete in the rocket engine, as some boron monoxide, B2O, is produced. This conversion mirrors the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, to produce carbon monoxide (CO). Diborane also proved difficult to handle.

Diborane has been investigated as a precursor to metal boride films and for the p-doping of silicon semiconductors.

== Safety ==

Diborane is a pyrophoric gas. Commercially available adducts are typically used instead, at least for applications in organic chemistry. These adducts include borane-tetrahydrofuran (borane-THF) and borane-dimethylsulfide.
The toxic effects of diborane are mitigated because the compound is so unstable in air. The toxicity toward laboratory rats has been investigated.

<doc id="241812" wikidata="Q1425059" url="?curid=241812" title="Hydraulic fluid">
<text>A hydraulic fluid or hydraulic liquid is the medium by which power is transferred in hydraulic machinery. Common hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil or water. Examples of equipment that might use hydraulic fluids are excavators and backhoes, hydraulic brakes, power steering systems, automatic transmissions, garbage trucks, aircraft flight control systems, lifts, and industrial machinery.

Hydraulic systems like the ones mentioned above will work most efficiently if the hydraulic fluid used has zero compressibility.

== Functions and properties ==

The primary function of a hydraulic fluid is to convey power. In use, however, there are other important functions of hydraulic fluid such as protection of the hydraulic machine components. The table below lists the major functions of a hydraulic fluid and the properties of a fluid that affect its ability to perform that function:

== Composition ==

===Base stock===
The original hydraulics fluid, dating back to the time of ancient Egypt, was water. Beginning in the 1920s, mineral oil began to be used more than water as a base stock due to its inherent lubrication properties and ability to be used at temperatures above the boiling point of water. Today most hydraulic fluids are based on mineral oil base stocks.

Natural oils such as rapeseed are used as base stocks for fluids where biodegradability and renewable sources are considered important.

Other base stocks are used for specialty applications, such as for fire resistance and extreme temperature applications. Some examples include: glycol ethers, organophosphate ester, polyalphaolefin, propylene glycol, and silicone oils.

NaK-77, a eutectic alloy of sodium and potassium, can be used as a hydraulic fluid in high-temperature and high-radiation environments, for temperature ranges of . Its bulk modulus at is 310,000 psi (2.14 GPa), higher than of a hydraulic oil at room temperature. Its lubricity is poor, so positive-displacement pumps are unsuitable and centrifugal pumps have to be used. The addition of caesium shifts the useful temperature range to . The NaK-77 alloy was tested in hydraulic and fluidic systems for the Supersonic Low Altitude Missile.

===Other components===
Hydraulic fluids can contain a wide range of chemical compounds, including: oils, butanol, esters (e.g. phthalates, like DEHP, and adipates, like bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), organophosphate (e.g. tributylphosphate), silicones, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, polyalphaolefins (PAO) (e.g. polyisobutenes), corrosion inhibitors (incl acid scavengers), anti-erosion additives, etc.

===Biodegradable hydraulic fluids===
Environmentally sensitive applications (e.g. farm tractors and marine dredging) may benefit from using biodegradable hydraulic fluids based upon rapeseed vegetable oil when there is the risk of an oil spill from a ruptured oil line. Typically these oils are available as ISO 32, ISO 46, and ISO 68 specification oils. ASTM standards ASTM-D-6006, Guide for Assessing Biodegradability of Hydraulic Fluids and ASTM-D-6046, Standard Classification of Hydraulic Fluids for Environmental Impact are relevant.

===Anti-wear hydraulic fluids===
Anti-wear (AW) hydraulic oils are made from a petroleum base fluid and commonly contain the anti-wear additive Zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). This additive works to protect the hydraulic pump. They come in multiple viscosity grades that have varying applications. For example, AW 46 hydraulic oils can be used to operate the hydraulic systems in off-road equipment such as dump trucks, excavators, and backhoes, while AW 32 hydraulic oils may be more suitable for colder weather applications like in a snow plow&#x27;s pump.

== Safety ==
Because industrial hydraulic systems operate at hundreds to thousands of PSI and temperatures reaching hundreds of degrees Celsius, severe injuries and death can result from component failures and care must always be taken when performing maintenance on hydraulic systems.

Fire resistance is a property available with specialized fluids. Water-glycol and polyol-ester are some of these specialized fluids that contain excellent thermal and hydrolitic properties, which aid in fire resistance.

== Uses ==

=== Brake fluid ===
Brake fluid is a subtype of hydraulic fluid with high boiling point, both when new (specified by the equilibrium boiling point) and after absorption of water vapor (specified by wet boiling point). Under the heat of braking, both free water and water vapor in a braking system can boil into a compressible vapor, resulting in brake failure. Glycol-ether based fluids are hygroscopic, and absorbed moisture will greatly reduce the boiling point over time. Mineral oil and silicone based fluids are not hygroscopic.

===Power steering fluid===
Power steering fluid is a sub type of hydraulic fluid. Most are mineral oil or silicone based fluids, while some use automatic transmission fluid, made from synthetic base oil. Automatic transmissions use fluids for their lubrication, cooling and hydraulic properties for viscous couplings.

Use of the wrong type of fluid can lead to failure of the power steering pump.

=== Aircraft hydraulic systems ===
As aircraft performance increased in the mid-20th century, the amount of force required to operate mechanical flight controls became excessive, and hydraulic systems were introduced to reduce pilot effort. The hydraulic actuators are controlled by valves; these in turn are operated directly by input from the aircrew (hydro-mechanical) or by computers obeying control laws (fly by wire).

Hydraulic power is used for other purposes. It can be stored in accumulators to start an auxiliary power unit (APU) for self-starting the aircraft&#x27;s main engines. Many aircraft equipped with the M61 family of cannon use hydraulic power to drive the gun system, permitting reliable high rates of fire.
The hydraulic power itself comes from pumps driven by the engines directly, or by electrically driven pumps. In modern commercial aircraft these are electrically driven pumps; should all the engines fail in flight the pilot will deploy a propeller-driven electric generator called a &quot;Ram-Air Turbine&quot; (RAT) which is concealed under the fuselage. This provides electrical power for the hydraulic pumps and control systems as power is no longer available from the engines. In that system and others, electric pumps can provide both redundancy and the means of operating hydraulic systems without the engines operating, which can be very useful during maintenance.

====Contamination====
Special, stringent care is required when handling aircraft hydraulic fluid, as it is critical to flight safety that it stay free from contamination. It is also necessary to strictly adhere to authorized references when servicing or repairing any aircraft system. Samples from aircraft hydraulic systems are taken during heavy aircraft maintenance checks (primarily C and D checks) to check contamination.

Military Spec 1246C is one fluid contamination specification.

The ISO fluid contamination scale assigns a contamination category based on particle size count and distribution.

===Other uses===
The properties of HLP 32 hydraulic oil make it ideal for lubricating machine tools.

== Specifications ==

=== According to DIN 51502 ===
Source:

* HL: With agents to enhance corrosion protection and age resistance. Used in hydraulic systems that do not pose any requirements as to wear protection.
* HLP: With agents to enhance corrosion protection and age resistance. Suitable for most fields of application and components.
* HLPD: As HLP but also used in systems where solid or liquid contamination need to be kept temporarily suspended.
* HVLP: With agents to enhance corrosion protection, age resistance, to reduce scuffing wear in mixed friction areas, and to improve the viscosity-temperature behavior. Used in system operated over a wide temperature range.
* HVLPD: As HVLP but also used in systems where solid or liquid contamination need to be kept temporarily suspended.

<doc id="241813" wikidata="Q518431" url="?curid=241813" title="Chimbote">
<text>Chimbote ; ) is a city in northwestern Peru. It is the largest city in the Ancash Region and the tenth most populous in Peru. With a population of 425,367 in 2017, it is the capital of both Santa Province and Chimbote District. The city has an altitude of 4 meters. 

The city is located on the coast in Ferrol Bay, 130 km south of Trujillo and north of Lima on the North Pan-American highway. It is the start of a chain of important cities on the Peruvian north coast like Trujillo, Chiclayo and Piura. The advantages of this geographic location made Chimbote into a transshipment junction for the Santa River valley. The city is the second most important port city after Callao.

== Etymology ==
The Quechuan languages corresponds to the journalists José Gutiérrez and Demetrio Ramos, who in Chimbote through history (1969) refer to the verb chimbar, a Quechuism originating from &quot;chimba&quot;, without delving into the process of formation of the word. According to the American linguist Gary Parker (1976), tsimpay means &#x27;to cross a river&#x27; in Ancashino Quechua, and the voicing of /p/ in the vicinity of /-m/ in syllabic coda position is known for Quechua, but remains in the transformation of /a/ into &quot;o&quot;, anomalous, like the same addition of -te, as for Guardia&#x27;s report.

==History==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
The territory in which Chimbote is currently located has been successively populated by the Recuay, Moche, Wari, Chimor and Inca cultures. The archaeological centers of Huaca San Pedro, El Castillo, among others, testify to this. It is thought that the same ethnic group populated these lands, the Maya, but the aborigines were later dispersed and decimated when the Conquest of America occurred.

=== Colonial era ===
It is in the book Introduction and description of the provinces belonging to the Archbishopric of Lima of 1774, written by Cosme Bueno, that the name of Chimbote appears for the first time in an official document. The reference tells […] that the old Villa de Santa María de la Parrilla (Santa), has a small fishing village called Chimbote attached to it. Ethnography refers to these first settlers as fishermen from the resort of Huanchaco, west of Trujillo, which is why they were called huanchaqueros.

=== Republican era ===
In 1835, when General Santa Cruz granted Chimbote&#x27;s first official acknowledgement, Chimbote was a village of fishermen with a population of no more than 800. During the Lynch expedition, an episode of the War of the Pacific, Chimbote was occupied by the Chilean Army, the Cambio Puente hacienda. As in the other occupations, the owner, Dionisio Derteano, was required to pay a fee so that the looting would not take place, but this was impossible, because in addition to demanding a very high amount, the Peruvian State closed the banks in order to avoid these quotas. Consequently, the enemy looted and destroyed the harvest, the mill and everything in it.

In 1871, an agreement was made with Henry Meiggs to build a railroad towards the interior of the country. Chimbote was classified as a port, even though its population remained around 1,000. The opening of the Pan-American Highway created easy access to Lima in the 1930s. In 1881, there was an attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay by Peru. The deal was blocked by Chile who sent its marines to occupy Chimbote after learning of the deal to cede a naval base to the U.S. Navy.

In 1940, Chimbote was still a small fishing port, with only 2,400 inhabitants in an urbanized area of . In 1943, the government created the Corporación Peruana del Santa (Peruvian Corporation of Santa). This entity assumed ownership of the railroad, made improvements to the port, and began work on a hydroelectric power station on the Río Santa (in the Cañón del Pato [Duck Canyon] in Huallanca). The first stage of the power station was inaugurated in 1958; also that year, an iron and steel plant was built. By 1943, the first companies dedicated to the extraction of liver from the Pacific bonito fish arrived. This liver was sold for a high price abroad due to World War II.

In the 1950s, port activity was consolidated with the constitution of the Peruvian Corporation of Santa, the construction of the Cañón de Pato hydroelectric plant and the beginning of steel activities. Around that time there were already some fish processing plants on the outskirts of the city. However, it was only in the 1960s that massive exploitation began, largely at the initiative of Luis Banchero Rossi, beginning the disorderly migratory exodus due to the high demand for labor. This growth also implied the arrival of services that made the growth of the city chaotic and disproportionate to plans.

The following decade would see the decline of the economy due to two factors: overfishing and environmental pollution, a product of the industry that depleted the schools of the coast, and climatic factors such as the El Niño phenomenon. Also in the year 1970, the bitter 1970 Ancash earthquake occurred, which reduced much of the city&#x27;s infrastructure and real estate to rubble, not counting the numerous deaths in Chimbote and the rest of the department; A big problem was already coming to Chimbote.

=== Present ===
The last few decades have been one of reorganization and ordering in process for Chimbote. After the collapse of the fishing industry and a new strong El Niño around 1983, interests were turned to agribusiness, tourism and commerce. In recent years, efforts have been made to recover the bay and remodel several buildings and public places.
== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

Chimbote&#x27;s climate is comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Chimbote&#x27;s proximity to the cool Humboldt current leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a tropical desert, and is classified as a desert climate. On average, the warmest month is February with temperatures a little over . September is considered the average coolest month, at around . The annual average temperature is around 20 °C (68 °F).

The city gets little to no precipitation; however, thick fog predominates through the months of May to November, usually overnight. Rainfall usually comes in February.

==Population==
A large number of people migrated to Chimbote in the early 1970s. By that time, less than 5 percent of the people from Chimbote would truly consider themselves native; between 1960 and 1970, Chimbote&#x27;s population multiplied by more than a hundred times. In 1900, the population of the port was 1,400; after 1970, it was 170,000. As of 2005, its population was 324,398.

The influx of residents was closely bound to the creation of the Corporación Peruana del Santa, to the start and development of the fishing industry, and to the establishment of the iron and steel plant (&quot;Siderperu&quot;). Together, these multiplied the commercial and productive activities of the port. At the beginning of 1996, as Peruvian public companies were privatized, the Peruvian-Brazilian company Acerco bought Siderperu.

===Districts and neighborhoods===
The city of Chimbote, being a district itself, comprises 7 more districts: Santa, Coishco, Samanco, Nepeña, Macate, Moro, Cáceres del Perú, and Nuevo Chimbote. The neighborhoods of El Barrio de Acero, Barrio Bolivar, El Progreso, Laderas del norte alto and laderas del norte bajo, Miraflores Alto and Miraflores Bajo surround Chimbote.

==Economy==

During the 1970s, the El Niño climate pattern, an earthquake, and overfishing drastically affected the fishing industry, and restrictions were imposed to ensure its survival. More than 75 percent of Peru&#x27;s fishing industry is based in Chimbote.

Chimbote is the largest fishing port in the world. Chimbote has more than 30 fish factories. One of the companies in Chimbote that stands out the most is the steel company SIDERPERU, it is the first steel company in Peru. Produces and markets high quality steel products, intended for the construction, mining and industrial sectors; both in the local and foreign markets. It has been part of Gerdau since 2006, a leader in the production of long steel on the American Continent.

Chimbote also has beaches that support tourism.
===Peruvian anchoveta &quot;boom&quot;===

Shortly after the fish canning industry declined, the industrialization of anchoveta fishing peaked. This attracted people from all over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote&#x27;s suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in Ancash, Cajamarca and the northern part of La Libertad Region. The axis of development moved from the Pima cotton, sugarcane, and rice plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit channel for the exports of the Santa valley, and a starting point for the entry to the Callejón de Huaylas.

The Peruvian anchoveta boom created wealth in the city, but it soon ended due to indiscriminate fishing that overwhelmed the bio-mass. An earthquake in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the fishing industries, causing unemployment and impoverishment. During this period, the Diocese of Chimbote created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with UNICEF. Since the 1960s, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh has served the poor at the Chimbote Mission, raising funds through the Chimbote Foundation.

<doc id="241814" wikidata="Q5865479" url="?curid=241814" title="Lithic period in Mesoamerica">
<text>In the History of Mesoamerica, the stage known as the [[Paleo Indians|Paleo-Indian period]] (or alternatively, the [[Lithic stage]]) is the era in the scheme of Mesoamerican chronology which begins with the very first indications of human habitation within the Mesoamerican region, and continues until the general onset of the development of agriculture and other proto-civilisation traits. The conclusion of this stage may be assigned to approximately 9000 BP (there are differences in opinion between sources which recognise the classification), and the transition to the succeeding Archaic period is not a well-defined one.

Its starting-point is a matter for some contention, as is the more general question of when human habitation in the Americas was first achieved. It is accepted by a significant number of researchers that the peopling of the Americas had occurred by circa 11,200 years ago.

== Periodisation ==
The start point of the Lithic Period is not well established, with commonly given dates ranging from 12,000 to 20,000 years ago. The Period&#x27;s end point is better settled, being commonly dated to circa 8000 BCE. As the Period is one of two which precede the appearance of pottery in Mesoamerica, it is considered a pre-ceramic period, and sometimes deemed to form part of &quot;the Preceramic Period&quot;. Furthermore, as the Period is one of five which precede the arrival of Christopher Columbus to Mesoamerica, it is considered a pre-Columbian or pre-Hispanic period, and thereby part of the Pre-Columbian era.

== History ==
===Migration===

Scientific opinion regarding human antiquity in Mesoamerica has reflected larger trends in conceptualising human antiquity in the western hemisphere in general. Within that foundational topic, the establishment of sites demonstrating human antiquity in Mesoamerica has centred on the association of remains and artifacts with geologic strata (context) and on the reliability of the dating of the remains and strata (methodologies).
At the beginning of the twentieth century, humans were believed to be very recent post-glacial immigrants to the western hemisphere. Although there was believed to have been anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 years of post-glacial time in which such immigration could have occurred over the Bering land bridge, the antiquity of human presence in the western hemisphere was popularly fixed at about 5,000 BP (&quot;before present&quot;, or 3000 BC). William H. Holmes and Ales Hrdlicka led this school of thought. The Folsom and Clovis discoveries of the 1920s and 1930s revised the minimum time frame for the initial occupation of the New World. The Folsom lithics dated to 10,000–11,000 BP, and the Clovis lithics dated to 12,000–12,500 BP, allowing for an original immigration date of about 14,000 BP.

===Lithic period===

In Mesoamerica, the period from about 9,000 BP back to the earliest occupations is referred to as the &quot;Paleoindian period.&quot; Evidence of human occupation in Mesoamerica consistent with that 14,000 BP original occupation date has been presented, debated, and accepted. Fluted points have been found north of Mesoamerica in the states of Sonora and Durango as well as in central Mexico, with proof of a mammoth hunt being uncovered at Santa Isabel Iztapan. Pleistocene-age bone artifacts have been found at Los Reyes La Paz. Human presence during this period has been further documented by cranial finds at Peña, Xico, Tepexpan, Santa Maria Astahuacan, and San Vicente Chicoloapan. A variety of methods were used to determine the antiquity of the cranial remains, including chemical bone analysis (nitrogen and fluorine tests), geological analysis (stratigraphic, carbon-14, and volcanic ash composition tests), contextual association with faunal remains, and contextual association with lithic artifacts dated by obsidian hydration.

The 14,000 BP immigration date maximum, however, has been challenged. Claims have been made for human presence in the 20,000–30,000 BP timeframe at Pennsylvania&#x27;s Meadowcroft Rock Shelter and in California&#x27;s Yuha Desert as well as sites in South America, Central America, and Mesoamerica.

A bone artefact from Tequixquiac may come from a pre-projectile point horizon. Evidence from Tlapacoya suggests human occupation dating to 23,000 BP. Valsequillo has five sites that appear to date from at least 20,000 BP. Based upon increasing evidence for an earlier antiquity for human presence in the western hemisphere, in 1976 Irving Rouse and Richard MacNeish independently published proposals revising western hemisphere lithic stages, allowing for human occupation as early as 30,000 BP and leaving open the possibility of an even earlier initial arrival.

<doc id="241815" wikidata="Q409309" url="?curid=241815" title="Methanethiol">
<text>Methanethiol (also known as methyl [[mercaptan]]) is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula . It is a colorless gas with a distinctive putrid smell. It is a natural substance found in the blood, brain and feces of animals (including humans), as well as in plant tissues. It also occurs naturally in certain foods, such as some nuts and cheese. It is one of the chemical compounds responsible for bad breath and the smell of flatus. Methanethiol is the simplest thiol and is sometimes abbreviated as MeSH. It is very flammable.

==Structure and reactions==
The molecule is tetrahedral at the carbon atom, like methanol. It is a weak acid, with a p&quot;K&quot;a of ~10.4, but is about a hundred thousand times more acidic than methanol. The colorless salt can be obtained in this way:
:CH3SH + CH3ONa → CH3SNa + CH3OH
The resulting thiolate anion is a strong nucleophile.

It can be oxidized to dimethyl disulfide:
:2CH3SH + [O] → CH3SSCH3 + H2O
Further oxidation takes the disulfide to two molecules of methanesulfonic acid, which is odorless. Bleach deodorizes methanethiol in this way.

==Occurrence==
Methanethiol (MeSH) is released as a by-product of kraft pulping in pulp mills. In kraft pulping, lignin is depolymerized by nucleophilic attack with the strongly nucleophilic hydrosulfide ion (HS−) in a highly alkaline medium. However, in a side reaction, HS− attacks methoxyl groups (OMe) in lignin, demethylating them to give free phenolate groups (PhO−) and releasing MeSH. Due to alkalinity, MeSH is readily deprotonated (MeSNa), and the formed MeS− ion is also a strong nucleophile, reacting further to dimethyl sulfide. The compounds remain in the liquor and are burned in the recovery boiler, where the sulfur is recovered as sodium sulfide.

Methanethiol is released from decaying organic matter in marshes and is present in the natural gas of certain regions, in coal tar, and in some crude oils. It occurs in various plants and vegetables, such as radishes.

In surface seawater, methanethiol is the primary breakdown product of the algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Marine bacteria appear to obtain most of the sulfur in their proteins by the breakdown of DMSP and incorporation of methanethiol, despite the fact that methanethiol is present in seawater at much lower concentrations than sulfate (~0.3 nM vs. 28 mM). Bacteria in environments both with and without oxygen can also convert methanethiol to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), although most DMS in surface seawater is produced by a separate pathway. Both DMS and methanethiol can be used by certain microbes as substrates for methanogenesis in some anaerobic soils.

Methanethiol is a byproduct of the metabolism of asparagus. The production of methanethiol in urine after eating asparagus was once thought to be a genetic trait. More recent research suggests that the peculiar odor is in fact produced by all humans after consuming asparagus, while the ability to detect it (methanethiol being one of many components in &quot;asparagus pee&quot;) is in fact the genetic trait. The chemical components responsible for the change in the odor of urine show as soon as 15 minutes after eating asparagus.

==Preparation==
Methanethiol is prepared commercially by the reaction of methanol with hydrogen sulfide gas over an aluminium oxide catalyst:
:CH3OH + H2S → CH3SH + H2O
Although impractical, it can be prepared by the reaction of methyl iodide with thiourea.

==Uses==

Methanethiol is mainly used to produce the essential amino acid methionine, which is used as a dietary component in poultry and animal feed. Methanethiol is also used in the plastic industry as a moderator for free-radical polymerizations and as a precursor in the manufacture of pesticides.

This chemical is also used in the natural gas industry as an odorant, as it mixes well with methane. The characteristic rotting vegetation smell of the mix is widely known by natural gas customers as an indicator of a possible gas leak, even a very minor one.

==Safety==
The safety data sheet (SDS) lists methanethiol as a colorless, flammable gas with an extremely strong and repulsive smell. At very high concentrations it is highly toxic and affects the central nervous system. Its penetrating odor provides warning at dangerous concentrations. An odor threshold of 1 ppb has been reported. The United States OSHA Ceiling Limit is listed as 10 ppm.

=== Accidents ===
In 2001 a rail car fire of near Trenton, Michigan left three people dead and nine injured.

On November 15, 2014, at DuPont&#x27;s La Porte, Texas facility, 24,000 pounds of methyl mercaptan was released and travelled downwind into surrounding areas, killing four and injuring one other. In 2023, DuPont pleaded guilty to criminal negligence for its role in the leak. The company was ordered to pay a $12 million fine and donate an additional $4 million to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.

On July 14, 2022, there was an accidental release of methanethiol in Charlotte, North Carolina. While there were no injuries, a rare weather event caused the odor to persist for several hours. Many believed they were experiencing a natural gas leak, which led to a high volume of emergency calls and the closure of several local government offices.

On April 10, 2024, an accidental release of a higher-than expected level of methyl mercaptan into the natural gas supply was attributed to an &quot;upstream supplier&quot; for Columbia Gas. This release was noticed by residents in at least Richland, Ashland, and Lorain counties in Ohio. Numerous schools cancelled their school day and numerous evacuations took place out of an abundance of caution prior to the understanding of the source of the odor. No known injuries or deaths were reported.

<text>Weser Flugzeugbau [[GmbH]], known as Weserflug, was an aircraft manufacturing company in Germany.

==History==
The company was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of the ship and machine company Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau AG (DESCHIMAG). It began production that year at Berlin Tempelhof, and in Bremen.

In 1935, Dr. Adolf Rohrbach became technical director of a new Weserflug factory at Lemwerder, near Bremen, which opened in 1936. He had been working on ideas for VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft since 1933, and now developed them further.

In 1938, the company developed the Weserflug P.1003, a VTOL aircraft. It had 4 m diameter propellers that swivelled between horizontal and vertical, and could fly up to 650 km/h. It requires very complex gearing to tilt the wings without varying the power to the propellers, and therefore was never built.

===World War II===
During World War II Weserflug had another factory in Liegnitz. It built Ju 188 and Ju 388 bombers, one of which survives in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.

Perhaps foreseeing the end of the war, the management of Weserflug transferred in 1944 from Berlin to Hoykenkamp, 15 km west of Bremen. It took over buildings previously used by Focke Achgelis.

During 1940-5, Weserflug built 5215 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka planes at Tempelhof. This plant also constructed Fw 190 fighters. Forced labour was used; on 20 April 1944 2,103 of the 4,151 Tempelhof workers were foreign forced labourers.

Ju 86 aircraft were manufactured at Lemwerder.

===After the war===
At the end of the war, all aircraft production in Germany halted for several years. In 1948 a trustee, Horst Janson, was appointed to collect the assets of Weser AG, to which Weserflug belonged. He was responsible for some postwar reindustrialization in Bremen, such as reactivating the shipbuilding industry, and joined the board of Weser AG. Production of motorized aircraft was forbidden in Germany from 1945 until 1955. In the 1950s the Hoykenkamp area was used for small businesses.

In 1960, while retaining his other commitments to the reindustrialisation of Bremen, Janson became chairman of Weser AG. In 1961, Weserflug joined forces with Focke-Wulf - also of Bremen - and Hamburger Flugzeugbau in the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) to develop rockets. Focke-Wulf and Weserflug formally merged in 1964, becoming Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW). Janson retired as chairman of Weser AG in 1969.

<doc id="241817" wikidata="Q7429973" url="?curid=241817" title="Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study">
<text>The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (also known as the 4S study), was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which provided the initial data that supported the use of the cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin, in people with a moderately raised cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD); that is people who had previously had a heart attack or angina. The study was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Merck and enrolled 4,444 people from 94 centres in Scandinavia.

Before the 4S study, it was not proven that lowering cholesterol could prolong life in people who had CHD. The study concluded that secondary prevention with simvastatin in a high risk group with CHD reduced overall mortality by 30%. Published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1994, it is considered a &quot;landmark paper&quot;.

==Objective==
The 4S multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 4,444 people chosen from 7,027 people who had been followed up for two months after being given dietary advice. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of a cholesterol-lowering drug called simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in people with a history of a previous heart attack or angina, who also had a moderately raised cholesterol; between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/L.

A second objective was to investigate whether the incidence of major coronary artery disease events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden death) could be reduced with simvastatin.

==Study details==
The participants, all at high risk of death from CHD and death in general, were selected from 94 clinical centers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1988 to 1989, and were aged between 35 and 70 years, with the average age being 59. Of the 4,444 people enrolled in the study, 3,617 were men and 827 women, 2,223 were randomly assigned a placebo and 2,221 were given 20 to 40 mg of simvastatin daily. The plan was to follow the participants for a minimum of three years or until such a time as total mortality reached 440 deaths. In practice, the study carried for a median period of 5.4 years.

==Results==

After 5.4 years, compared to the group that were given placebo, the simvastatin group demonstrated a 35% reduction in LDL-C and 30% reduction in overall mortality. The risk of hospital-verified non-fatal myocardial infarction reduced by 37% and fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events (stroke and TIA) lessened by 28%. 30 people would need to be treated with simvastatin for about five years, to prevent one death; number needed to treat around 30. There were no extra deaths from other non-cardiac causes such as cancer or trauma. The trial also showed benefits in diabetes, women and older people.

A follow-up of treatment with simvastatin for up to eight years was published in 2000. Ten years after the start of the 4S trial, a follow-up study published on 28 August 2004 in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, revealed that of those 2,221 people who continued to take simvastatin, there was a further reduction in number of deaths from CHD when compared to those who had switched from placebo to statin at the five year mark. The overall mortality also reduced by 15% at the 10 year mark.

==Conclusion==
The study concluded that secondary prevention with simvastatin in a high risk group with CHD reduced overall mortality by 30%. Non-fatal CHD events and fatal and non-fatal cerebrovascular events were reduced without an increase in risk of cancer.

==Response==
Published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1994, the 4S trial, had an immediate influence on medical opinion, and is considered a &quot;landmark paper&quot;. Several other large multicenter clinical trials followed, leading to widespread use of simvastatin.

Data from the 4S trial has frequently been used to analyse the cost-effectiveness of simvastatin in secondary prevention.

==Regular polytopes==
This table shows a summary of regular counts by dimension.

There are no nonconvex Euclidean regular tessellations in any number of dimensions.

===Polytope elements===
The elements of a polytope can be considered according to either their own dimensionality or how many dimensions &quot;down&quot; they are from the body.

*Vertex, a 0-dimensional element
*Edge, a 1-dimensional element
*Face, a 2-dimensional element
*Cell, a 3-dimensional element
*Hypercell or Teron, a 4-dimensional element
*Facet, an (&quot;n&quot;-1)-dimensional element
*Ridge, an (&quot;n&quot;-2)-dimensional element
*Peak, an (&quot;n&quot;-3)-dimensional element

For example, in a polyhedron (3-dimensional polytope), a face is a facet, an edge is a ridge, and a vertex is a peak.

*Vertex figure: not itself an element of a polytope, but a diagram showing how the elements meet.

===Tessellations===

The classical convex polytopes may be considered tessellations, or tilings, of spherical space. Tessellations of euclidean and hyperbolic space may also be considered regular polytopes. Note that an &#x27;n&#x27;-dimensional polytope actually tessellates a space of one dimension less. For example, the (three-dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the &#x27;two&#x27;-dimensional &#x27;surface&#x27; of the sphere.

===Zero dimension===
*Point

===One-dimensional regular polytope===
There is only one polytope in 1 dimension, whose boundaries are the two endpoints of a line segment, represented by the empty Schläfli symbol {}.

<doc id="241821" wikidata="Q3328715" url="?curid=241821" title="Music of Malaysia">
<text>Music of Malaysia is the generic term for music that has been created in various genres in Malaysia. A great variety of genres in Malaysian music reflects the specific cultural groups within multiethnic Malaysian society: Malay, Javanese and other cultures in overlap with the neighbouring Indonesian archipelago, Arabic, Chinese, Indian, Dayak, Kadazan-Dusun, Bajau, Orang Asli, Melanau, Kristang and others.

In general, music of Malaysia may be categorised as classical, folk, syncretic (or acculturated music), popular and contemporary art music. Classical and folk music emerged during the pre-colonial period and exists in the form of vocal, dance and theatrical music such as &quot;Nobat&quot;, &quot;Mak Yong&quot;, &quot;Mak Inang&quot;, &quot;Dikir barat&quot;, &quot;Ulek mayang&quot; and &quot;Menora&quot;. The syncretic music developed during the post-Portuguese period (17th century) and contains elements from both local music and foreign elements of Arabian, Persian, Indian, Chinese and Western musical and theatrical sources. Among genres of this music are &quot;Zapin&quot;, &quot;Ghazal&quot;, &quot;Mata-kantiga&quot;, &quot;Joget&quot;, &quot;Jikey&quot;, &quot;Boria&quot; and &quot;Bangsawan&quot;.

Both Malaysian popular music and contemporary art music are essentially Western-based music combined with some local elements. In 1950s, the musician P. Ramlee helped in creating a Malaysian music that combined folks songs with Western dance rhythms and western Asian music.

==Ethnic traditions==
Besides Malay music, Chinese and Indian Malaysians have their own forms of music, and the indigenous tribes of Peninsular and East Malaysia have unique traditional instruments.

===Malay music===
Traditional Malay music spans from music for various theatrical forms such as wayang kulit, bangsawan and dance dramas as well as story-telling, to folk songs and music for dances, royal ceremonies, martial arts (&quot;silat&quot;), life cycle events, and religious occasions. Many forms of traditional Malay music and performing arts appear to have originated in the Kelantan-Pattani region with influence from India, China, Thailand and Indonesia. The music is based around percussion instruments, the most important of which is the gendang (drum). There are at least 14 types of traditional drums, including &quot;kompang&quot; and &quot;hadrah&quot; drums. Drums and other traditional percussion instruments are often made from natural materials. Besides drums, other percussion instruments (some made of shells) include: the rebab (a bowed string instrument), the serunai (a double-reed oboe-like instrument), the seruling (flute), and trumpets. Music is traditionally used for storytelling, celebrating life-cycle events, and times like harvest. It was once used as a form of long-distance communication.

The ancient royal court music of Malaysia is called the Nobat, and this music is still performed at formal royal events in Kuala Lampur&#x27;s Istana Negara (and Brunei&#x27;s Lapau). 

In East Malaysia, gong-based musical ensemble such as agung and kulintang are commonly used in ceremonies such as funerals and weddings. These ensembles are also common in neighbouring regions such as in the southern Philippines, Kalimantan in Indonesia and Brunei.
The Malays of Kelantan and Terengganu are culturally linked to peoples from the South China Sea area, and are quite different from the West Coast of Malaya. The martial art of silat Melayu developed in the Malay Peninsula since the beginning of common era also popular in Malaysia, while essentially still important as a branch of the self-defence form. Similar to tai chi, though of independent origin, it is a mix of martial arts, dance and music typically accompanied by gongs, drums and Indian oboes.

The natives of the Malay Peninsula played in small ensembles called kertok, which performed swift and rhythmic xylophone music. This may have led to the development of dikir barat. In recent years, the Malaysian government has promoted this Kelantanese music form as a national cultural icon.

Johor art performances such as Zapin and Hamdolok as well as musical instruments including Gambus and Samrah have apparent Arab and Persian influences.
Arabic-derived zapin music and dance is popular throughout Malaysia, and is usually accompanied by a gambus and some drums. Ghazals from Arabia are popular in the markets and malls of Kuala Lumpur and Johor, and stars like Kamariah Noor are very successful. In Malacca, ronggeng is the dominant form of folk music. It played with a violin, drums, guitar, bass, synthesizer, button accordion and a gong instrument. Another style, Dondang Sayang is slow and intense; it mixes influences from China, India, Arabia, and Portugal with traditional elements.

===Chinese music===
The &quot;Hua Yue Tuan&quot; (华乐团), or &quot;Chinese orchestra,&quot; is made up of traditional &quot;Chinese&quot; musical instruments and some Western instruments. The music itself combines western polyphony with Chinese melodies and scales. Although the bulk of its repertoire consists of music originated from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China, many local Chinese orchestras also regularly perform Malay folk tunes with various local composers making a definite effort to absorb elements of surrounding musical cultures, especially Malay, into their compositions. In Malaysia, Chinese orchestras exist nationwide in urban areas which have large concentrations of Chinese Malaysians. Sponsored largely by various Chinese organisations including schools, clan associations and Buddhist societies, a typical orchestra consists of between 12 and 50 members. The orchestra is usually made up of four sections: bowed string instruments, plucked strings, the wind section, and percussion. Also commonly found are percussion troupes with drums, gongs and cymbals that provide rhythm for performances of Lion Dance.

There is no lack of virtuoso performers in the Chinese classical tradition in Malaysia. Advanced training is however not presently available with most Malaysian virtuoso musicians obtaining their advanced training either in China or Singapore. Various professional and semi-professional Chinese orchestras are in existence. Malaysian western trained classical conductors are employed full-time. Much of the music played is imported from China. There are however some accomplished Malaysian composers for this medium such as Saw Boon Kiat and Chew Hee Chiat.

There has been a local Malaysian Chinese recording industries since the 1960s with generations of Chinese singers involved in Mandopop music. In the 1960s singers such as Poon Sow Keng (潘秀瓊) achieved notable success in the region, and in the 1970s and 80s, Malaysian Chinese pop singers such as Wong Shiau Chuen, Lan Yin, Donny Yap, and Lee Yee were popular. In more recent times, popular singers include Eric Moo, Lee Sin Je, Fish Leong, Z Chen, Penny Tai and Daniel Lee.

===Indian music===
Traditional Indian music may be associated with religious tradition and faith. As its origins in India, there are two systems of traditional or classical Indian music in Malaysia: Carnatic music and Hindustani music. Since Tamils from South India are the predominant group among the Indian population in Malaysia, it is the South Indian Carnatic music which predominates. Simply speaking, Hindustani classical music is more lyric-oriented, while Carnatic classical music emphasises musical structure.

Indian classical music as it is performed in Malaysia has remained true to its origin. There is practically no other cultural influence. Other than reflecting Indian life, the purpose of Indian classical music is to refine the soul.

The fundamental elements of Carnatic music are the &quot;raga&quot; and the &quot;tala&quot;. A raga is a scale of notes, while the tala is the time-measure. A Carnatic music concert usually starts with a composition with lyrical and passages in a particular raga. This will be followed by a few major and subsequently some minor compositions.

In Malaysia, traditional and classical Indian music are studied and performed by Malaysians of Indian ethnic origin with material that still comes from India. Musical productions are mainly in the form of dance dramas incorporating instrumental ensemble, vocal music and dance. Musical instruments used in the performances are imported from India.

Over the years, Punjabi music has established itself in Malaysia. One example of famous Punjabi music is bhangra. Many Malaysian songs today have the Punjabi influence. For example, the sound of the dhol, an instrument used mainly by the Punjabis, has been incorporated in many Malay, Chinese and Indian songs in Malaysia.

===Indigenous tribal music===

The Orang Asli groups of West Malaysia, Semang, Senoi, and Orang Melayu Asli, have their own musical traditions. The Semang people are nomadic and their musical instruments are disposable and created when needed, and instruments used include nose flute (&quot;salet&quot;, &quot;nabad&quot;), Jew&#x27;s harp and tube zither (&quot;kərɑtuŋ&quot;) which are also used by the Senoi. Instruments used by the Senoi are more long-lasting and include &quot;kərəb&quot; (a two-string chordophone). The Orang Melayu Asli however have closer contact with Malay and Chinese populations and used a wider range of musical instruments ranging from thigh xylophone (&quot;kongkong&quot;) to violin. The instruments may be used for shamanistic purposes such as singing and trance-dancing ceremonies, and healing rituals.

A number of ethnic groups such as the various Dayak tribes (e.g. Iban, Murut), Kadazan, and Bajau are found in Sabah and Sarawak. The music of these people include vocal music for epics and narratives; songs for life-cycle events and rituals associated with religion, healing, growing rice, hunting game, and waging war; songs for dancing and community entertainment; as well as a wide variety of instrumental music. Instruments used include drums, gongs, flutes, zithers, xylophones, and Jew&#x27;s harps, of which the bronze gongs are the most significant. Ensembles of gongs of various sizes are played to welcome guests and in ceremonies and dances. A well-known instrument in Sarawak is the , a plucked lute of the Kayan and Kenyah people which is used for entertainment and dancing. Other instruments include the xylophone , bamboo flutes (), and sets of bamboo tubes called &quot;togunggak&quot; which were formerly played in headhunting ceremonies of the Murut.

===World music===
Ethnic music has also found a new and vigorous following, with world music festivals like the Rainforest World Music Festival, held annually since 1998 in a scenic open-air setting in Sarawak. The first Malaysian &quot;ethnic fusion&quot; group to play on this international platform was Akar Umbi - comprising Temuan ceremonial singer Minah Angong (1930–1999), Antares and Rafique Rashid. Unfortunately, the charismatic Minah Angong (better known as Mak Minah) died just three weeks after winning over the hearts of a whole new audience at the RWMF 1999. This left Akar Umbi with only one posthumously released CD to its name (&#x27;Songs of the Dragon,&#x27; Magick River, 2002).

Private companies like Trident Entertainment have begun to invest in the production, distribution and promotion of the &quot;ethnic fringe&quot; in Malaysian music.

==Classical music==
Within Malaysia, the largest performing arts venue is the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. The resident orchestra is the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO). Malay popular music is a combination of the music from all ethnicities in the country. The Malaysian government has taken steps in controlling what music is available in Malaysia; rap music has been criticised, heavy metal has been limited, and foreign bands must submit a copy of a recent concert before playing in Malaysia. It is believed that this music is a bad influence on youth.

===Fusion music===

In the field of Malaysian contemporary music a number of composers have gained international recognition, for example composers Chong Kee Yong, Dr Tazul Izan Tajuddin, Yii Kah Hoe, Saidah Rastam, Adeline Wong and others, encompassing a diverse range of styles and aesthetics.

== Modern music ==

=== Pop ===

Malaysia&#x27;s pop music scene developed from traditional social dance and entertainment music such as &quot;asli&quot;, &quot;inang&quot;, &quot;joget&quot;, &quot;dondang sayang&quot;, &quot;zapin&quot; and &quot;masri&quot;, which were adapted to Anglo-American dance band arrangement by Bangsawan troupes in the 1920s and 1930s. The Bangsawan troupes are in fact a type of Malaysian opera influenced by Indian opera at first known as Wayang Parsi (Persia) which was started by rich Persians residing in India. They portrayed stories from diverse groups such as Indian, Western, Islamic, Chinese, Indonesian and Malay. Music, dance, and acting with costumes are used in performance depending on the stories told. The musicians were mostly local Malays, Filipinos and Guanis (descendants from Goa in India).

One of the earliest modern Malay pop songs was &quot;&quot;Tudung Periok&quot;, sung by Momo Latif, who recorded it in 1930. In the 1950s, P. Ramlee became the most popular Malay singer and composer with a range of slow ballads such as &quot;Azizah&quot;, &quot;Dendang Perantau&quot; and the evergreen &quot;Di Mana Kan Ku Cari Ganti&quot;&quot;.

In the 1960s, a genre of pop music influenced by The Beatles and other British rock and roll bands called &#x27;Pop Yeh-yeh&#x27; appeared in Malaysia. The term &quot;pop yeh-yeh&quot; was taken from a line from the popular Beatles song, &quot;She Loves You&quot; (&quot;she loves you, &quot;yeah-yeah-yeah&quot;&quot;). In the 1960s and 1970s, a modified rock combo called kugiran (an abbreviation of &quot;kumpulan gitar rancak&quot;, meaning rhythmic guitar bands) was also common, and was often used to accompany singers.

In the mid-1990s, dangdut experienced a resurgence after lying dormant since the early 1980s with the debut of Amelina. Her least successful album sold in the 100,000s, a feat that is yet to be repeated in the 2010s. Composer Ruslan Mamat, who pioneered the modern Dangdut, credited Ace of Base for the tempo reference. The decade also saw a resurgence of interest in traditional music genres like ghazal and inang driven by artists like Siti Nurhaliza and Noraniza Idris with new classically inspired but upbeat songs make major airwave rotation and mainstream spotlight in music shows and awards under the banners of &quot;Irama Malaysia&quot; (&quot;Malaysian Melodies&quot;), &quot;etnik kreatif&quot; (&quot;creative ethnic [music]&quot;) or &quot;pop etnik&quot; (&quot;ethnic pop&quot;).

Contemporary pop music exchanges between Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei are normal due to the literary form of Malay used in songwriting widely understood in all four countries.

=== Hip Hop ===

KRU is the most successful Hip Hop dance group in Malaysia. After bringing Rap music to the masses in 1992, they established their own record label creating the first Malaysian girl group Feminin and R&amp;B crooners Indigo. Feminin debuted at RTM Eid ul-Fitr special in 1993 marking the start of the 90s girls group era.

SonaOne is a Malaysian rapper with notable songs like &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot; and &quot;No More&quot;

=== Rock ===

Malaysian rock reached its peak in the 80s and early 90s with the local adaptation of a fusion of blues rock, hard rock and ballad. The popularity even reached the neighbouring country of Indonesia.

Awie is a Malaysian rock singer and was extremely popular in 1990s.

<doc id="241824" wikidata="Q221643" url="?curid=241824" title="How the West Was Won (Led Zeppelin album)">
<text>How the West Was Won is a live triple album by the English rock group Led Zeppelin, released by Atlantic Records on compact disc on 27 May 2003, DVD-Audio on 7 October 2003 and Blu-ray audio in 2018. The recordings are taken from two 1972 performances in California during their tour of North America: L.A. Forum (25 June 1972) and Long Beach Arena (27 June 1972).

== Background ==
Guitarist Jimmy Page considers Led Zeppelin at this point to have been at their artistic peak, as is mentioned in the album&#x27;s liner notes and in an interview he gave to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 2010.

For many years, recordings of these two shows circulated only in the form of bootlegs, such as &quot;Burn Like a Candle&quot;. Though soundboard recordings of Led Zeppelin concerts were circulated among fans after being stolen from Page&#x27;s personal archive in the mid-1980s, no such versions of the 1972 Long Beach or LA Forum shows were taken, meaning &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; was the first chance fans had of hearing the soundboard versions of these concerts. The songs from the two shows underwent extensive editing and audio engineering by Page at Island Studios in London before being released on the album.

&quot;It wasn&#x27;t in our thoughts to try and outdo &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;…&quot; remarked engineer Kevin Shirley. &quot;The reason those performances still stand up now is because Jimmy really was a genius. He could create tempests, summon storms. He really was the master of light and shade. And the musicians around him allowed him to flesh out that vision. Especially John Bonham, without whom Jimmy and Zeppelin would never have been able to do what he did.&quot;

<text>Mamai (Mongolian Cyrillic: Мамай, ; 1325?–1380/1381) was a powerful Turko-Mongol military commander in Beylerbey rank of the Golden Horde from Kiyat clan. Contrary to popular misconception, he was not a khan (king), but was a kingmaker for several khans, and dominated parts or all of the Golden Horde for almost two decades in the 1360s and 1370s. Although he was unable to stabilize central authority during the 14th-century Golden Horde war of succession known as the Great Troubles, Mamai remained a remarkable and persistent leader for decades, while others came and went in rapid succession. His defeat in the Battle of Kulikovo marked the beginning of the decline of the Horde, as well as his own rapid downfall.

==Origins==
Unlike the khans of the so-called Golden Horde, Mamai was not a descendant of Genghis Khan and his son Jochi, but belonged to the powerful Mongol Kiyat clan, which claimed descent from Mugetu Kiyan (Mūngdū Qayān), an older brother of Genghis Khan&#x27;s father Yesugei Baghatur. While they served the rulers of the Golden Horde from at least Batu Khan, the Kiyats may have risen in importance after the fall of the rival khan Nogai in 1299. Abandoning Nogai in favor of the legitimate khan, Toqta, Aq-Buqa Kiyat enjoyed the favor of the khan and his successor, and served as one of the chief emirs. Another Kiyat, Isatai, was entrusted with governing the former ulus of Orda in the eastern part of the Golden Horde, by Öz Beg Khan. Isatai&#x27;s son Jir-Qutluq and the latter&#x27;s son Tingiz-Buqa enjoyed the same position under the next khans, Jani Beg and Berdi Beg. Specific information about Mamai&#x27;s immediate origins is very limited, but his father is named as Alash Beg (possibly Ali Beg), probably the son of Tuluq-Timur Kiyat, and therefore possibly the brother of the aforementioned Isatai. At least part of the clan may have been ensconced in the Crimea, perhaps since the early 14th century, before several Kiyats appeared as governor on the eastern periphery of the Golden Horde. The date of Mamai&#x27;s birth can be estimated only generally, to somewhere in the mid-to-late 1320s. At birth, he appears to have received the Muslim name Muḥammad, sometimes paired with the nickname Kičik (&quot;little&quot;), perhaps due to his short stature. Whether &quot;Mamai&quot; is a variation of that name or an additional, &quot;folk&quot; name, remains unclear. According to contemporary Timurid source Nizam al-Din Shami’s Ẓafar-nāma Kiyats were called Uzbek: &quot;chun hissa-yi ab-i khud bi-Uzbak dadi ki az nasl-i Qiyat ast, dar ulus-i Chaghatay zikr-i in makrumat baqi manad&quot;. Later sources, such as Majmu al-tawarikh ru], included Kiyat clan as one of ninety-two Uzbek ru] clans of the Golden Horde.

==Rise to power==
Mamai became an emir during the reign of Jani Beg (1342–1357). After the governorship of Crimea at Solkhat had been held by a member of a different family in 1349–1356, it seems to have been conferred on Ali Beg, perhaps Mamai&#x27;s father. He died soon after, and the governorship was given to his brother, Qutluq-Timur. He appears to have died by 1359, and the governorship was entrusted to a member of another clan, Qutluq-Buqa of the Kungrat, a brother of the chief emir (beglerbeg) Mogul-Buqa. Mamai appears to have resented this apparent slight, and left the capital Sarai with his dependents and clansmen, to assert himself locally in and near the Crimea.

Troubled by this desertion and possibly already threatened by a rival claimant to the throne (Qulpa), Khan Berdi Beg (1357–1359) apparently recalled Mamai to the court and named him chief emir (beglerbeg). Moreover, perhaps at this time Berdi Beg gave his daughter in marriage to Mamai. Although the explicit reference to the marriage by Ibn Khaldun only refers to the princess by title (&quot;Ḫānum&quot;), she has been plausibly identified as Tulun Beg Khanum, whom Mamai would later briefly elevate to the throne, and who would later yet marry Tokhtamysh Khan. Perhaps in keeping with tradition within the Golden Horde, Mamai (like Edigu after him) does not appear to have taken the title of &quot;Güregen&quot;, commonly taken by men marrying women descended from Genghis Khan. According to the contemporary traveler Ibn Khaldun, Mamai was now in charge of all government, while Russian chronicles note him sending emissaries to Moscow.

==Kingmaker after the death of Berdi Beg==
The sudden (and probably violent) death of Berdi Beg in August 1359, and the resulting accession of Qulpa undermined Mamai&#x27;s position of supremacy at court. Under Qulpa and his successor Nawruz Beg, Mogul-Buqa became beglerbeg again, confirming Mamai&#x27;s exclusion from power at court, although his precise position and relations with the khans remains unclear. Still in control of at least part of the warriors associated with the Kiyat tribe, Mamai was apparently too powerful to eliminate. Until 1361, moreover, he may have had a formidable ally in his cousin governing the former Ulus of Orda. The elimination of Mamai&#x27;s cousin, Tingiz-Buqa, by the local khan Qara-Noqai, may have threatened to undermine Mamai&#x27;s safety and impelled him to act proactively. The murder of Khiḍr Khan, a descendant of Jochi&#x27;s son Shiban, and the struggle among his kinsmen and rivals for possession of Sarai in 1361 gave Mamai the opportunity to do so. Since Mamai was not a descendant of Genghis Khan and Jochi in the male line, he assumed the role of kingmaker, promoting and supporting Jochid khans of his own choosing from a base in the Crimea and the western portion of Golden Horde. With Mamai&#x27;s help, these khans sought to establish themselves at the capital Sarai, albeit with intermittent success. The precise origin of Mamai&#x27;s protégés is nowhere stated clearly, and there has been a tendency to consider them descendants of Batu Khan. Nevertheless, the purge of the ruling family perpetrated by Mamai&#x27;s father-in-law Berdi Beg in 1357 makes such identifications unlikely. A more plausible hypothesis identifies Mamai&#x27;s puppet khans with a cluster of suitably-named princes listed among a &quot;Crimean&quot; branch of the descendants of Jochi&#x27;s son Togai-Timur in the genealogical compendiums &quot;Muʿizz al-ansāb&quot; and &quot;Tawārīḫ-i guzīdah-i nuṣrat-nāmah&quot;. If this identification is accepted, Mamai&#x27;s protégés as khans were as follows:
* ʿAbdallāh (= ʿAbdal, son of Mīnkāsar, son of Abāy, son of Kay-Timur, son of Togai-Timur, son of Jochi, son of Genghis Khan), khan 1361–1370; recognized at Sarai 1362, 1367–1368, and 1369–1370.
* Tūlūn-Bīk Khānum (daughter of Berdi Beg, wife of Mamai, later of Tokhtamysh), queen, recognized at Sarai 1370–1371, died 1386.
* Muḥammad-Sulṭān (= Muḥammad, son of ʿAbdal), khan 1370–1379, recognized at Sarai 1371–1373 and in 1374.
* Tūlāk (= Tawakkul, son of Tughluq Khwāja, brother of ʿAbdal), khan 1379–1380, never recognized at Sarai.

==Mamai and the Great Troubles in the Golden Horde==

After briefly supporting the impostor who pretended to be Kildi Beg, son of Jani Beg, Mamai proclaimed his own khan, ʿAbdallāh, in the Crimea in 1361, and succeeded in installing him at Sarai in 1362. However, later the same year ʿAbdallāh was ejected from the city by Murād (or Mürid, 1362–1363), a brother of the former ruler Khiḍr Khan. He was expelled by Khayr-Pūlād (or Mīr-Pūlād, 1363–1364), and he by ʿAzīz Shaykh (1364–1367). All three were descendants of Jochi&#x27;s son Shiban. Mamai&#x27;s inability to hold Sarai in 1362 is possibly to be attributed with his preoccupation with his western front, where the Lithuanians had inflicted a defeat on the representatives of the Golden Horde at the Battle of Blue Waters. Despite some territorial losses, Mamai was able to curb the Lithuanian advance. This allowed him to regroup in the Crimea, suppress local opposition (by besieging Solkhat), and eventually to make another attempt on Sarai. 

In 1367 Mamai took advantage of (and possibly engineered) the murder of Khan ʿAzīz Shaykh to reinstall Khan ʿAbdallāh at Sarai. However, Mamai was unable to enjoy his success for long. His rival Ḥājjī Cherkes, ruler of Astrakhan, struck at Mamai&#x27;s power base in the Crimea, forcing him to leave Sarai and rush home. Meanwhile, Ḥājjī Cherkes proclaimed a khan of his own, Ūljāy-Timur, a descendant of Jochi&#x27;s son Toqai-Timur, and advanced on Sarai. Khan ʿAbdallāh was once more expelled from the capital, and Ūljāy-Timur was enthroned there by Ḥājjī Cherkes in 1368. Mamai now repaid his rival in kind, attacking Ḥājjī Cherkes&#x27; power base Astrakhan. While Ḥājjī Cherkes was distracted with defending Astrakhan, his protégé Ūljāy-Timur lost the throne of Sarai to Ḥasan Beg (1368–1369), a nephew of the earlier khan Khayr-Pūlād, and thus a descendant of Jochi&#x27;s son Shiban.

Mamai was determined to recover control of Sarai. He captured and executed the exiled Ūljāy-Timur and in 1369 managed to expel Ḥasan Beg from the city, once more enthroning Khan ʿAbdallāh. When the latter died in 1370, Mamai seems to have hesitated before making ʿAbdallāh&#x27;s young son Muḥammad-Sulṭān khan, at least at Sarai. Accordingly, in 1370–1371 he had Sarai recognize as reigning queen, Tulun Beg Khanum, apparently Mamai&#x27;s wife, the daughter of Khan Berdi Beg. Meanwhile, Mamai&#x27;s Crimean headquarters already coined in the name of Muḥammad-Sulṭān. After suppressing opposition in Volga Bulgaria with the help of Dmitrij of Suzdal&#x27;, Mamai felt secure enough to proclaim Muḥammad-Sulṭān khan at Sarai the end of 1371 or the beginning of 1372.

Mamai&#x27;s success once again proved ephemeral. Perhaps during Mamai&#x27;s absence, in 1373, Sarai attracted a new conqueror, Urus Khan, another descendant of Jochi&#x27;s son Tuqa-Timur, who had become ruler of the former Ulus of Orda in the eastern portion of the Golden Horde. Urus appears to have ejected Mamai&#x27;s protégé Muḥammad-Sulṭān from Sarai, only to lose the city immediately (if he ever held it at this point) after failing to dislodge Ḥājjī Cherkes from Astrakhan. This rivalry allowed another descendant of Shiban, Khayr-Pūlād&#x27;s brother Īl Beg, to seize Sarai briefly in 1374. Mamai returned to Sarai, defeating and expelling Īl Beg, and reinstalling Muḥammad-Sulṭān in 1374. No sooner had Mamai succeeded in this task, that he was again forced to attend to a crisis on the western frontier, where the Lithuanians and Wallachians had defeated one of his lieutenants. As in 1362, his rapid response met with some success, but in the process he lost control of Sarai: Muḥammad-Sulṭān was expelled by again by Urus Khan in 1374. He lost the city in his turn in 1375, to Qāghān Beg, the son of Īl Beg. Qāghān Beg subsequently yielded the throne of Sarai to his cousin ʿArab Shāh, son of Khayr-Pūlād, in 1377. Finally, in 1380, ʿArab Shāh was forced to yield Sarai to Tokhtamysh, the eventual nemesis of both Urus Khan and Mamai.

After the ejection of Mamai&#x27;s protégé Muḥammad-Sulṭān from Sarai in 1374, apart from a possible brief occupation of the city in either 1375 or 1376, Mamai and his puppet khans no longer controlled the traditional capital of the Golden Horde. Nevertheless, they still exercised authority in the lands north, west, and south of the city, and in 1375 Mamai was able to have his khan recognized at Astrakhan, following the death of his old rival Ḥājjī Cherkes. Mamai&#x27;s attempt to retain suzerainty over the Russian princes, however, was successfully challenged and undermined by the new Khan ʿArab Shāh, who in 1378 defeated and killed Mamai&#x27;s subordinate ally Tagai, the governor of Mokhshi. Continued reverses in Volga Bulgaria and Russia (see below) threatened Mamai&#x27;s position, and perhaps because of this he disposed of his puppet khan Muḥammad-Sulṭān and replaced him with a new protégé, Tūlāk, by February 1379.

==Mamai and overseas: Mamluks and Italians==
During the 1370s, Mamai reestablished the traditional friendly relations between the Golden Horde and Mamluk Egypt, on behalf of his khan. Closer to home, he was in frequent diplomatic contact or armed conflict with the Italian merchant colonies in the Crimea and, more generally, the northern shores of the Black Sea. The rivalry between Venetians and Genoese exacerbated the difficulties involved in these relations. When the Venetians of Tana supported Kildi Beg as khan, Mamai punished their leadership, including the Venetian consul Jacopo Corner. Subsequently, he sought to improve relations with them by granting them a lower tribute in a diploma issued in the name of his khan, ʿAbdallāh, in 1362. Later, in 1369, Mamai lowered the Venetian tribute even more, restoring the amount paid before the wars between Öz Beg and Jani Beg and the Italians. Mamai, moreover, allowed the Venetians to build fortifications at Tana: they built a small fortress in 1370, which they expanded in 1375, to protect themselves from their Genoese rivals. Mamai&#x27;s interactions with the Genoese appear to have been more frequent. In the early 1370s the relations were peaceful, and in 1374 Mamai himself was received with honor in Genoese Caffa. To maintain his good relations with the Genoese, Mamai went as far as to ignore their seizure of Soldaia from the Prince of Gothia, one of his vassals. After his loss of Sarai in 1374, Mamai became more concerned about these Genoese gains in the Crimea, confiscated Soldaia and other settlements that had been taken over by the Genoese, and proceeded to fortify his administrative center at Solkhat. Mamai may have shown favor to the Pisan colony at Porto Pisano on the Don, on the north coast of the Sea of Azov.

==Mamai and Lithuania==
Perhaps to offset the economic influence of the Italian merchants, Mamai also granted diplomas to merchants from Polish Cracow in 1372 and from its rival, Galician L&#x27;vov, in 1379. Relations with Lithuania, ruled by Algirdas (1345–1377) and Jogaila (1377–1434) were dominated by diplomatic and military concerns. On at least two occasions, in 1362 and 1374, Mamai lost control over Sarai, because he and the bulk of his forces had to rush to the western frontier to oppose Lithuanian advances from the northwest. Although for the most part he managed to stem these advances, Mamai lost territory to Lithuania, most notably the Podolia following the Lithuanian victory at the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362. The influence or overlordship of the Golden Horde in Moldavia also ended about this time, the principality becoming autonomous, albeit under Hungarian and Lithuanian influence. While the Lithuanians were exploiting the troubles within the Golden Horde to their advantage, Mamai appears to have attempted to do the same during the competition for power within Lithuania after the death of Algirdas in 1377 between his brother and son: in 1380 the Lithuanian prince Aleksandras Karijotaitis fell in battle against the Mongols. Algirdas&#x27; son Jogaila eventually decided that he needed Mongol support against his uncle, and sent an envoy to Mamai to make peace and arrange for an alliance between them.

Mamai could benefit from his new Lithuanian alliance to keep the Russians in line, especially as the prince of Moscow, also grand prince of Vladimir became increasingly recalcitrant and refused to pay his heavy tribute in silver to the Mongols. Military operations and raids for plunder yielded limited results. Although some other Russian princes did continue to pay their tribute (most notably that of Tver&#x27;), Mamai sought alternatives to make up for the lost influx of silver. One was to use gold obtained in long distance trade with India to mint coins for commerce with the Italians.

==Attempts to control the Russian principalities==
Early in his political career, Mamai may have assisted in the diplomatic initiative that secured the liberation of the Metropolitan Aleksej from Lithuanian captivity, and his return to Moscow in 1360. Even while ejected from Sarai in 1363, Mamai, in the name of his puppet khan ʿAbdallāh, sought to secure the service and tribute of the Russian princes, and to that end he came to an arrangement with Dmitrij of Moscow and the Metropolitan Aleksej, lowering the amount of tribute owed to the khan; the prince of Moscow was also confirmed in his possession of Rostov. The rival khan Murād accordingly invested another Russian prince, Dmitrij Konstantinovič of Suzdal&#x27;, as grand prince of Vladimir. Similarly, Mamai and Khan ʿAzīz Shaykh supported rival claimants for the throne of Nižnij Novgorod in 1365; in this instance, Mamai supported Dmitrij Konstantinovič, who subsequently helped Mamai subdue opposition in Volga Bulgaria in 1370. The struggle for supreme authority in the Golden Horde thus presented the Russian princes with both challenges and opportunities. 

In 1370, Mamai shifted his favor from Dmitrij of Moscow (who had failed to assist Mamai&#x27;s cause in Volga Bulgaria) to the prince of Tver&#x27; Mihail Aleksandrovič, who was duly invested as grand prince of Vladimir. Dmitrij did not yield the grand princely throne, and in fact attacked Mihail as he was returning from Sarai, forcing him to flee to his brother-in-law Algirdas of Lithuania. Although the Lithuanians took up Mihail&#x27;s cause and besieged Moscow in December 1370, the siege was lifted by the arrival of Dmitrij&#x27;s allies. The Lithuanians returned home, while Mihail went to Sarai to seek Mamai&#x27;s help. He received a second investiture with the grand princely throne of Vladimir in early 1371, but was refused entry into Vladimir by the inhabitants. Dmitrij ignored Mamai&#x27;s instructions to submit to Mihail, but soon presented himself before Mamai with gifts, and secured his own confirmation as grand prince of Vladimir. In effect, Mamai had forced the princes of Moscow and Tver&#x27; to bid for the throne of Vladimir with gifts, which enriched Mamai and his followers. This opportunistic policy did not, however, solidify Mamai&#x27;s control over the Russian princes, and in 1373 Dmitrij of Moscow assumed an ambivalent attitude during Mamai&#x27;s raid into the lands of Rjazan&#x27;.

Mamai lost the cooperation of the Russian princes, and especially Dmitrij of Moscow, after his loss of Sarai in 1374. Dmitrij may have felt the need or opportunity to refuse Mamai&#x27;s demands for tribute, as his influx of silver from Hanseatic trade in the Baltic declined, while the Golden Horde was apparently impacted by an outbreak of plague. Emboldened by the attitude of Moscow, Nižnij Novgorod arrested and beat Mamai&#x27;s envoys in 1374. Mamai retaliated by raiding the lands of Nižnij Novgorod and sacking Novosil&#x27; in 1375; he also invested Mihail of Tver&#x27; with the title of grand prince of Vladimir once again. Dmitrij immediately besieged Tver&#x27; and secured Mihail&#x27;s renunciation of the elusive claim, while signing a defense pact against the Mongols. By 1376, most Russian princes transferred their obedience to Qāghān Beg and his cousin ʿArab Shāh, serving them in a punitive expedition in Volga Bulgaria. When the Russian princes helped themselves to local wealth without authorization, they risked the khan&#x27;s wrath, and in 1377 the Moscow and Nižnij Novgorod joined forces to defend themselves against their new overlord. But while ʿArab Shāh prepared to engage them, and in the absence of the Muscovite forces, Mamai intervened (assisted by the Mordva), defeated the Nižegorodians at the P&#x27;jana river, and then sacked and burned Nižnij Novgorod in 1377. Unwilling to see his overlordship over the Russian princes pass back to Mamai, ʿArab Shāh raided through Suzdalia and sacked Rjazan&#x27;.

==Three final defeats: Vozha, Kulikovo, Kalka==
In 1378, Mamai dispatched an army under several emirs against Rjazan&#x27;, which had not yet recovered from the raid of ʿArab Shāh the previous year. Oleg Ivanovič, the prince of Rjazan&#x27; was unable to offer resistance, but Dmitrij of Moscow decided to oppose the Mongols. As they were crossing the Voža river on 11 August 1378, the Mongols were beset on three sides by the Muscovites, defeated, and turned to flight. The battle was Dmitrij&#x27;s first victory against the Mongols, and resulted in heavy losses among the Mongol warriors and even commanders. Humiliated and irritated, Mamai led another raid on Rjazan&#x27;, once more sacking the city. 

Perhaps trying to recover his position by diplomacy, Mamai next showed favor to the Muscovite candidate for the newly vacant metropolitan throne, Archimandrite Mihail, granting him a diploma from the khan in February 1379, long before he could be appointed metropolitan by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. The friendly gesture did not yield the desired results, and Mihail perished during the sea voyage from Caffa to Constantinople. Mamai also made one more attempt to turn the Russian princes against each other, sending a renegade Muscovite boyar to incite Mihail of Tver&#x27; against Dmitrij of Moscow; the plan failed when he was recognized and arrested at Serpuhov, to be publicly executed in Moscow at the end of August 1379.

His other plans having failed, Mamai sent an ultimatum to Dmitrij of Moscow, demanding that the grand prince submit and pay an increased tribute to Mamai&#x27;s new khan, Tūlāk. Dmitrij failed to accede to the demand, and Mamai prepared for war. He sought out the support of Jogaila of Lithuania and was also assured of the cooperation of Oleg Ivanovič of Rjazan&#x27;. While Mamai was still gathering his forces (including mercenaries from Transcaucasia and Genoese Crimea), an alliance of Russian forces under Dmitrij of Moscow, excluding the princes of Tver&#x27; and Rjazan&#x27;, crossed southward into Mongol territory in an anticipatory advance. Abandoning their usual defence strategy, the Russian forces suddenly attacked Mamai&#x27;s army on 8 September 1380 at Kulikovo Field on the banks of the Neprjadva river near the Don. Mamai&#x27;s mercenaries were perhaps poorly coordinated, although they offered determined resistance. Mamai&#x27;s puppet khan failed to reach safety and was forced to fight, perishing in the engagement. Much of Mamai&#x27;s force failed to engage before a Russian ambush regimen turned the tide of the battle definitively in Dmitrij&#x27;s favor. Mamai&#x27;s forces routed and he fled the battlefield, leaving it in the hands of Dmitrij, who was later called Donskoj (&quot;of the Don&quot;) in memory of his victory. 

While Mamai was concentrating on Russian affairs, a descendant of Jochi&#x27;s son Tuqa-Timur named Tokhtamysh was rising to power in the east. Having already challenged his cousin Urus Khan, he sought the protection and support of Timur (Tamerlane), and then proceeded to replace Urus&#x27; sons as ruler of the former Ulus of Orda by 1379. In early 1380, Tokhtamysh was able to advance on Sarai and to obtain the submission and abdication of Khan ʿArab Shāh. The advance of Tokhtamysh, and his continued success (he conquered Astrakhan later in 1380), sabotaged Mamai&#x27;s hopes of avenging his defeat at Kulikovo. Mamai was now forced to oppose Tokhtamysh on the Kalka River. Perhaps at the head of larger and better-rested forces, Mamai could hope for victory. However, he now lacked a legitimate khan to use as his protégé, and at any rate Tokhtamysh had already begun to suborn some of Mamai&#x27;s emirs. In the resulting battle, many of Mamai&#x27;s commanders deserted to Tokhtamysh together with their troops. Mamai fled the battlefield with his remaining loyal supporters, but lost his harem and much of his possessions to the victor.

==Death==
Mamai and his retinue made their way to the Crimea. Mistrusting the loyalty and ability of his governors there, Mamai decided to seek refuge in Genoese Caffa. However, fearing the wrath of Tokhtamysh, the city&#x27;s commune refused to admit Mamai within the walls. Still pursued by Tokhtamysh&#x27;s agents, Mamai now headed to his old headquarters at Solkhat. Here, too, he was refused admittance: the population and the governor, Qutluq-Buqa, did not want to provoke Tokhtamysh. Besides, the governor hoped to preserve his position under the new ruler, while the populace resented the heavy taxes Mamai had levied to fortify the city. At the end of 1380 or the beginning of 1381, the agents of Tokhtamysh caught up with Mamai outside Solkhat and killed him. Nevertheless, he was given an honorable burial by order of Tokhtamysh. The death of Mamai paved the way for Tokhtamysh to attempt the reunification of the Golden Horde.

== Purported descendants: Princes Glinskie ==
Mamai&#x27;s son Mansur Kiyat entered the service of Tokhtamysh; his son Aleksandr, who had converted to Christianity, entered the service of Vytautas of Lithuania and was made prince of Glinsk with multiple estates around the modern city of Poltava (Ukraine). This is supposed to have occurred in the early 15th century, although the first documented mention of the Glinski princes dates to 1437. Mihail L&#x27;vovič Glinskij was the most illustrious member of the family: he studied at the German university, took part as a knight in the Italian Wars, was the most powerful man in Lithuania in the 16th century, but later rebelled and ran away with his brothers to Muscovy and helped the Russians to retake the city of Smolensk. His niece Elena Glinskaya was married to Vasilij III of Moscow, and Ivan the Terrible was their son.

<text>Erkki Sakari Tuomioja (born 1 July 1946) is a Finnish politician and has previously been a member of the Finnish Parliament. From 2000 to 2007 and 2011 to 2015, he served as the minister for foreign affairs. He was president of the Nordic Council in 2008.

Tuomioja is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Finland, although his political views are thought to be more to the left than the party line. He is also a member of ATTAC. In 1975, Tuomioja dated Tarja Halonen who later became the president of Finland.

==Biography==

Tuomioja comes from a family of politicians. His father Sakari Tuomioja was a prominent liberal Finnish politician and diplomat, and the challenger of Urho Kekkonen for the conservatives and liberals in the 1956 presidential elections. His maternal grandmother was Hella Wuolijoki, the Estonian born writer and socialist activist.

Tuomioja holds the degrees of Master of Social Sciences (1971) and Master of Science in Economics and Business Administration (1974) from the Helsinki School of Economics, as well as Licentiate in Social Sciences (1980) and Doctor in Social Sciences (1996) from the University of Helsinki. In addition to Finnish, Tuomioja speaks Swedish, English, French, German and Estonian.

Tuomioja has been a member of the Finnish Parliament 1970–1979 and 1991–present. He held the position of minister of trade and industry in Lipponen&#x27;s 2nd government, and became the minister of foreign affairs after Tarja Halonen was elected as president of Finland. Tuomioja is the longest serving minister for foreign affairs of Finland.

Tuomioja, like several other Finnish socialist politicians of today, took part in the illegal occupation of the Old Student House (Vanha ylioppilastalo) in Helsinki on 25 November 1968. He was a member of the anti-war group Committee of 100 of Finland and took part in the so-called Erik Schüller case, in which a group of students made public incitement against obligatory conscription. Despite his anti-war stance, Tuomioja did carry out his own mandatory military service and is a reservist staff sergeant.

Tuomioja is the author of several books. His &quot;A Delicate Shade of Pink&quot; about his grandmother Hella Wuolijoki and her sister Salme Murrik won the Non-Fiction Finlandia Prize in 2006. The book was originally written in English and translated to Finnish as &quot;Häivähdys punaista&quot;. In the 1970s and 1980s he was the editor-in-chief of &quot;Ydin&quot;, a foreign policy and political magazine.

Tuomioja was behind the initiative to establish Historians without Borders in Finland as an NGO. He has acted as Chairman of the Board of HWB Finland since the founding meeting in the summer of 2015. Tuomioja is a declared atheist.

== European Union presidency ==
When Finland held the rotating European Union presidency in the second half of 2006, Tuomioja had a prominent role as the spokesman of European Union foreign policy. He was among the first to demand an immediate cessation of hostilities in the 2006 Israel–Lebanon conflict. He was one of Finland&#x27;s most dominant politicians in the 1990s.

<doc id="241834" wikidata="Q1634225" url="?curid=241834" title="Major League Lacrosse">
<text>Major League Lacrosse (MLL) was a men&#x27;s field lacrosse league in the United States. The league&#x27;s inaugural season was in 2001. Teams played anywhere from ten to 16 games in a summertime regular season. This was followed by a four-team playoff for the championship trophy, the Steinfeld Trophy, named after founder Jake Steinfeld. League attendance peaked at 6,417 in 2011 and the 2019 average was 4,587.

The Chesapeake Bayhawks and New York Lizards (originally the Baltimore Bayhawks and Long Island Lizards) were MLL members throughout its existence and competed in the first three championship games, with the Lizards winning two. The Boston Cannons, the last of the six charter franchises to remain in their original market with their original name, won their first championship in 2011. The Philadelphia Barrage returned to the league in 2020 after an 11-season hiatus. After moving from Bridgeport to Philadelphia, the Barrage won three championships in four years from 2004 to 2007. For much of the league&#x27;s history, the Denver Outlaws were the only team west of the Mississippi River, being part of the league&#x27;s ambitious westward expansion in 2006. Being owned by the Pat Bowlen family and the Denver Broncos, the Outlaws were successful from the start, missing the postseason only once in 14 seasons, while claiming three championships in ten appearances. The Connecticut Hammerheads were the league&#x27;s youngest franchise, and were set to play at Rafferty Stadium near Bridgeport in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced a shortened, quarantined season.

The final champions were the Boston Cannons, who defeated the Denver Outlaws at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, following a COVID-19-shortened 2020 season.

On December 16, 2020, the league announced that it would be merging with the Premier Lacrosse League. At the time of the announcement, the 2020 MLL champion Boston Cannons were announced as the only team continuing play in the 2021 season as members of the PLL. Their roster would be set via expansion draft and, following PLL style, dropping &quot;Boston&quot; from their name, becoming the Cannons Lacrosse Club.

==History==

===Founding (2001–2005)===
Major League Lacrosse was founded in 1999 by Jake Steinfeld, Dave Morrow and Tim Robertson. Steinfeld is the creator of the Body By Jake line of exercise equipment and videos. Morrow is a former All-American lacrosse player at Princeton and the president of Warrior Sports. Tim Robertson is the son of televangelist Pat Robertson and the former CEO of The Family Channel.

Steinfeld was a former lacrosse player at Cortland State (NY), read an article about Dave Morrow. After reading the article, Steinfeld couldn&#x27;t believe that with the excitement the sport of lacrosse has, there was not a professional outdoor league. Steinfeld said, &quot;For years, America&#x27;s top collegiate lacrosse players have not had the opportunity to play in a professional outdoor league at the conclusion of their collegiate careers. Those days are over with the creation of Major League Lacrosse.&quot;

The league held two separate drafts to stock the six teams for the 2001 season. The first draft took place in 2000 for post-collegiate players. A second draft was held on June 1, 2001, in Baltimore, Maryland, for players whose college eligibility had expired in 2001. Ryan Mollett of Princeton was selected first overall by the Rochester Rattlers. In addition, each team was assigned three franchise players to each team before the initial draft.

MLL began play in 2001 with six teams in the northeastern U.S. split into two divisions. The American Division included teams in Boston, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and on Long Island; the National Division included teams in Baltimore, New Jersey, and Rochester. All teams were owned by the league, which assigned three franchise players to each team before the initial draft.

The first MLL game took place on June 7, 2001, with the Baltimore Bayhawks defeating the Long Island Lizards 16–13 at Homewood field in Baltimore, Maryland. Chris Turner scored the first goal in MLL history.

The MLL played a 14-game regular season its first two years, then the schedule was cut to 12 games. After the first year, the league&#x27;s playoff format had the top teams in each division advancing to the semifinals, with two wild card playoff spots going to the teams with the next-best records regardless of division.

The first MLL Championship Game saw the Long Island Lizards beat the Baltimore Bayhawks 15–11 in September 2001. The game was played at the John F. Kennedy Stadium in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Paul Gait was named the game&#x27;s MVP.

Four out of the first five championship games were between the Long Island Lizards and the Baltimore Bayhawks. The Lizards won titles in 2001 and 2003, while the Bayhawks won in 2002 and 2005. The recently relocated Philadelphia Barrage beat the Boston Cannons 13–11 in 2004&#x27;s final.

In 2003, New Balance became a &quot;founding member&quot; and major sponsor of MLL. New Balance founder and CEO, Jim Davis got very involved in the operation of the league, including providing financial support. Davis still owns the Dallas Rattlers.

In 2005, Andrew Goldstein became the first American male team-sport professional athlete to be openly gay during his playing career. Goldstein played goalie for the Long Island Lizards from 2005 to 2007, although he only appeared in two games in 2006.

===Expansion and contraction (2006–2011)===
MLL added four teams for the 2006 season, bringing the league&#x27;s number of teams up to ten. The expansion markets were Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and San Francisco, extending the league across the country and into top media markets. MLL combined the original six teams into the Eastern Conference and put the new teams into the Western Conference.

The Los Angeles Riptide were owned by the Anschutz Entertainment Group and played its home games at the Home Depot Center. Denver Broncos&#x27; owner Pat Bowlen brought the Denver Outlaws to an NFL stadium, Mile High. The other new franchises were the Chicago Machine and the San Francisco Dragons.

Despite winning championships in 2006 and 2007, Philadelphia didn&#x27;t attract more than 2,500 fans to their games. So in 2008, the Barrage tested out new markets by playing all of its &quot;home&quot; matches in five other cities: Cary, North Carolina; Hillsboro, Oregon; Irving, Texas; St. Louis; and Virginia Beach. In addition, the Barrage&#x27;s &quot;home game&quot; against the Cannons was played in Boston.

At the end of the 2008 season, four teams – Los Angeles, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and San Francisco – folded due to financial problems. Several of these teams suffered from poor attendance, San Francisco drew 2,808 per game and only 1,920 in New Jersey. This contraction forced the remaining six teams to form one conference.

The Rochester Rattlers won the 2008 Steinfeld Cup but like the Barrage, struggled at the gate. At the start of the 2009 season, a new ownership group in Toronto bought the rights to the Rochester franchise. The Toronto Nationals inherited the staff and players of the team, but the Rattlers&#x27; name and team colors were left in Rochester for the possibility of a future team. That same group of players went on to win another championship in 2009 playing for a different team in a different country.

The Chicago Machine played the entire 2010 season as a traveling team testing expansion markets for the league, before deciding that the franchise would be moving to Rochester and adopting the Rattlers name in 2011.

In 2010, the Bayhawks and Lizards met for the fifth time in the championship game. The Bayhawks prevailed 13–9, almost the same score as when they beat Long Island 15–9 five years earlier. The newly renamed Chesapeake Bayhawks went on to win two more championships in the next three years, in 2012 and 2013. Their five Steinfeld Cup trophies are the most in MLL history.

The league&#x27;s attendance peaked at 6,417 per game in the 2011 season. The individual franchises had a wide range of local support. Denver lead the league in attendance, drawing 12,331 fans per game in 2011, while the relocated Hamilton Nationals had 1,214 people per game, one-tenth of Denver&#x27;s attendance.

===LXM Pro Tour===
In late 2009, Kyle Harrison, Scott Hochstadt, Craig Hochstadt, Xander Ritz, and Max Ritz formed the LXM Pro Tour. The tour would feature two teams playing games across the country at special events involving the LXM Pro game and youth activities. The tour competed for players with the MLL as the more established league would not let players under contract play in other professional lacrosse events.

On February 13, 2014, MLL announced a partnership with the LXM Pro Tour, a week after the league announced a new equipment deal with STX, a sponsor of one of the LXM Pro teams. The deal moved LXM to the MLL off-season and allowed players to participate in both MLL and LXM. However, LXM Pro didn&#x27;t hold any tour stops after the announcement.

===Southern trend (2012–2018)===
During the early years of MLL, the league did not have any teams in the southeast. In January 2011, Commissioner David Gross announced that Charlotte, North Carolina, as well as Columbus, Ohio, were granted expansion teams for the 2012 season. The Ohio Machine and Charlotte Hounds opened play in April 2012, with both teams missing the playoffs in their inaugural season. With the expansion, the league grew to eight teams and expanded its schedule to fourteen games.

In November 2013, the Hamilton Nationals folded and an expansion franchise was awarded to the Florida Launch for the 2014 season. The Launch inherited the Nationals roster. The Atlanta Blaze became the ninth MLL team in 2016. The Rattlers relocated [again] from Rochester, New York, in 2018 to Dallas, Texas, and began play as the Dallas Rattlers in 2018.

===Second contraction (2019 to 2020)===
On April 1, 2019, just two months before the start of the season, the league announced that the Charlotte Hounds, Florida Launch, and Ohio Machine would not be playing in 2019. While the Hounds announced they would be back in 2021 under new ownership in a renovated stadium, the Launch and Machine effectively folded. The announcement dropped the league down to six teams, the fewest teams since 2011, and meant all remaining owners owned only one team. Jim Davis, owner of New Balance, had owned the Hounds, Launch, and Machine, but he now owns only the Dallas Rattlers.

Returning from a two-year retirement, 44-year-old John Grant Jr. broke the record for career points scored during the 2019 season. Also in 2019, MLL saw its first goal by a Japanese player, Kohta Kurashima, who is also the first Japanese born player in MLL history. The Rattlers ceased operations after the 2019 season. and the staff and roster were shifted to an expansion team called the Connecticut Hammerheads. The Atlanta Blaze also ceased operations after the 2019 season and were replaced by a resurrected Philadelphia Barrage. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league announced they would play a week-long quarantined season in Annapolis at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium with no fans. Every team would play each other once (five total games) before a four-team playoff as normal.

=== PLL merger (2020) ===
On December 16, 2020, it was announced that the MLL had agreed to merge all operations with the Premier Lacrosse League. Under this agreement, the leagues will operate as one under the &quot;PLL&quot; brand and model. In order to accommodate the influx of players the PLL will be expanding the league to include its eighth touring team, known as Cannons Lacrosse Club, paying homage to the 2020 MLL champions, the Boston Cannons. The roster of this new team was determined by the 2021 expansion draft.

==Rules==
A Major League Lacrosse Field is 110 yards long and 60 yards wide. The game is 60 minutes long, divided into four 15-minute quarters with 15-minute intermission at halftime, plus multiple 10-minute golden goal periods for regulation games ending in ties unless one team scores, which wins the game. Teams are required to dress twenty players, with ten players on the field at a time. MLL rules are based on NCAA rules with various changes. The most significant are a two-point goal line from each goal, a 60-second shot clock, the elimination of the restraining box, and allowing dive shots. The shot clock was originally 45 seconds before it was changed to 60 seconds for the 2005 season. From the inception of the league to 2008, there was a limit of three long-stick defensemen per team in order to promote scoring. Beginning in 2009, the league conformed to high school and college lacrosse rules and now allows four long–sticks per team on the field at any one time. 20 players dress for each regular-season game.

== Teams ==
=== Timeline ===

== Championship games ==
The MLL Championship Game was played at a neutral site decided by the league. Teams qualified for the playoffs by finishing with one of the top four records during the regular season. Those four teams played in a semifinal to determine who plays in the Championship Game. 
===Performance by team===
== Draft ==
Every year, Major League Lacrosse held a collegiate player draft. The collegiate player draft occurred prior to the league season. Only players who competed at the collegiate level and whose NCAA eligibility has expired in the previous season were eligible for the draft. The exact date, location, and number of rounds varied each year.

In addition, each off-season, MLL heald a supplemental player draft. The draft was held to expand a team&#x27;s protected list to a pre-season active roster of 40 players. If a player wasn&#x27;t selected, they returned to the player pool.

=== Top draft picks ===
==Attendance==
From 2006, overall league attendance varied between 3,800 and 6,500 per game, peaking in 2011 and steadily decreasing to an all-time low in 2018. There had always been a great deal of disparity in attendance figures for different teams in the league. Playing at Invesco Field at Mile High, the Denver Outlaws had led the league in attendance all but one year of their existence. A significant portion of Denver&#x27;s attendance was from one game each year. The Outlaws established a tradition of having a game on the Fourth of July that always attracted the biggest single-game attendance in the league. 31,644 people attended the game and watched fireworks afterward in 2015. The Fourth of July game regularly attracted over 25,000 people. Outside of this special event game, Denver drew about 6,000 per game.

== League operations ==
The league was owned by Major League Lacrosse, LLC, which was controlled by the founders and the six franchises. The founders – Steinfeld, Morrow, Robertson, and Davis – control five of 14 ownership shares (36%); the nine franchises each had one ownership share (7%). Davis owned two of the nine franchises and has a stake in two others.

Atlanta Blaze owner Peter Trematerra sued Major League Lacrosse, LLC, Commissioner Gross, Jim Davis and several businesses controlled by the founders of the league in April 2017. Trematerra alleged that Gross provided inaccurate information about the profitability of the league in 2014, when Trematerra was considering buying an expansion franchise. The suit also claimed that because the league, some of its major sponsors, and Lax Sports Network were all controlled by the same people and entities, sponsorship and broadcast rights were sold for below market value.

In August 2017, the MLL accidentally exposed the confidential personal information of over 1,000 players, nearly everyone who has ever played in the league or tried out for a team. The information was stored in one excel spreadsheet that was publicly linked on the league&#x27;s website for a day. It is unknown if any player experienced identity theft as a result of the incident.

Headquarters:
*East Rutherford, New Jersey (1999–2001)
*Secaucus, New Jersey (2001–2004)
*Boston, Massachusetts (2004–2020)

==Television coverage==
Fox Sports Network broadcast games for the first two seasons, then ESPN2 televised a weekly MLL game from 2003 through 2011. In 2012, ESPN2 televised three regular season games, the All-Star Game, one semifinal, and the MLL Championship game. MLL games have not been regularly shown on ESPN2 since 2012 due to low ratings. Games continue to be streamed on ESPN3. CBS Sports Network has televised all-star games and the playoffs since 2013. MLL did not receive any money from these networks for these deals.

In 2017, Lax Sports Network was given exclusive rights to all 63 regular season games. Twitter streamed the semifinal games and CBS Sports Network broadcast the final.

On April 1, 2019, the league announced they had reacquired broadcast rights from Lax Sports Network. It was unclear where each team would broadcast its games, though the Cannons announced on March 28 that NBC Sports Boston would air all 16 of their games.

One day prior to the start of the 2019 season, the league announced that 12 games would be broadcast on Stadium and the network would air a weekly studio show.

Also in 2019, MLL re-partnered with the ESPN network. Weekly coverage was shown on ESPN+ and several games, including the league championship, were broadcast nationally on ESPN2. MLL saw their biggest television-reach in league history. The semi-finals and finals combined for 297 million total household viewers.

Major League Lacrosse would expand its relationship with ESPN for the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season. All 18 games (including postseason) were available on the ESPN family of networks, including ESPN+. ESPN2 broadcast two games on Sunday, July 19. A few days later, the partnership was expanded to TSN for Canadian viewers and ESPN Player to allow fans to watch from over 130 countries. The championship game was broadcast on ESPN&#x27;s flagship station on Sunday, July 26.

<text>Heidenheim () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the east of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Ostalbkreis, Dillingen, Günzburg, Alb-Donau and Göppingen.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Heidenheim&quot;, which was created at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1808 it was enlarged by merging with the &quot;Oberamt Giengen&quot;. It was converted into a district in 1934/38, and enlarged by municipalities from the &quot;Oberamt Neresheim&quot; and the &quot;Oberamt Ulm&quot;. The communal reform of 1973 left the district virtually unchanged.

==Geography==
The district is located in the high plains of the Swabian Alb (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;) mountains.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show the colors of the Lords of Hellenstein in the left half. They ruled the city Heidenheim until 1307. The castle tower to the right symbolizes the many castles in the district. The area was split between many ruling families, who built castles for protecting their ownership.

<text>Andrew Elborn Clements (May 29, 1949 – November 28, 2019) was an American author of children&#x27;s literature. His debut novel &quot;Frindle&quot; won an award determined by the vote of U.S. schoolchildren in about 20 different U.S. states. In June 2015, &quot;Frindle&quot; was named the Phoenix Award winner for 2016, as it was the best book that did not win a major award when it was published.

==Life==
Clements was born in Camden, New Jersey, and lived in nearby Oaklyn and Cherry Hill before moving to Springfield, Illinois as a pre-teen. As a child, he enjoyed summers at a lakeside cabin in Maine where he spent his days swimming, hiking, water skiing, and his evenings reading books. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature from Northwestern University and a Masters of Arts in Elementary Education from National Louis University, he worked as a teacher, sharing his love of reading with elementary, middle, and high school students.

He worked for several publishing companies where he published, acquired, edited, marketed, and developed quality children&#x27;s books. In 1985, Clements added his own work to the market with a picture book entitled &quot;Bird Delbert&quot;. His first novel was the award-winning &quot;Frindle&quot;, which has won 16 state book awards, as well as the Christopher Award.

Clements was married to the former Rebecca Pierpont, and they had four sons. He died at his home in Baldwin, Maine, on November 28, 2019, at age 70 from an undisclosed illness.

==Awards==
The Children&#x27;s Literature Association named &quot;Frindle&quot; the best English-language children&#x27;s book published in 1996 that did not win a major contemporary book award, thus making it the winner of the Phoenix Award for 2016.

<text>Shinar ( ; ; ) is the name for the southern region of Mesopotamia used by the Hebrew Bible.

==Etymology==
Hebrew &quot;Šinʿār&quot; is equivalent to the Egyptian &quot;Sngr&quot; and Hittite &quot;Šanḫar(a)&quot;, all referring to southern Mesopotamia. Some Assyriologists considered &quot;Šinʿār&quot; a western variant or cognate of &quot;Šumer&quot; (Sumer), with their original being the Sumerians&#x27; own name for their country, &quot;ki-en-gi(-r)&quot;, but this is &quot;beset with philological difficulties&quot;. Another hypothesis derives the name from a Kassite tribe known as the &quot;Šamharu&quot;, whose name would have been later used for Babylonia in general.

Sayce (1895) identified &quot;Shinar&quot; as cognate with the following names: &quot;Sangara&quot;/&quot;Sangar&quot; mentioned in the context of the Asiatic conquests of Thutmose III (15th century BC); &quot;Sanhar&quot;/&quot;Sankhar&quot; of the Amarna letters (14th century BC); the Greeks&#x27; &quot;Singara&quot;; and modern &quot;Sinjar&quot;, in Upper Mesopotamia, near the Khabur River. Accordingly, he proposed that Shinar was in Upper Mesopotamia, but acknowledged that the Bible gives important evidence that it was in the south.
Albright (1924) suggested identification with the Kingdom of Khana.

==Hebrew Bible==
The name &quot;Šinʿār&quot; occurs eight times in the Hebrew Bible in which it refers to Babylonia. That location of Shinar is evident from its description as encompassing both Babel/Babylon (in northern Babylonia) and Erech/Uruk (in southern Babylonia). In the Book of Genesis 10:10, the beginning of Nimrod&#x27;s kingdom is said to have been &quot;Babel [Babylon], and Erech [Uruk], and Akkad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.&quot; Verse 11:2 states that Shinar enclosed the plain that became the site of the Tower of Babel after the Great Flood.

In Genesis 14:1,9, King Amraphel rules Shinar. It is further mentioned in Joshua 7:21; Isaiah 11:11; Daniel 1:2; and Zechariah 5:11, as a general synonym for Babylonia.

==Jubilees==
The Book of Jubilees 9:3 allots Shinar (or, in the Ethiopic text, &quot;Sadna Sena`or&quot;) to Ashur, son of Shem. Jubilees 10:20 states that the Tower of Babel was built with bitumen from the sea of Shinar.

==In popular culture==
The region&#x27;s name in its Greek form is used in the title of &quot;Chants of Sennaar&quot;, a video game that draws motifs from the Tower of Babel narrative.

<text>Emma Lee Bunton (born 21 January 1976) is an English singer, songwriter, media personality, and actress. She rose to fame in the 1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Baby Spice, reflecting the fact that she was the youngest member. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Spice Girls are the best-selling female group of all time. The group went on an indefinite hiatus in 2000, before reuniting for a greatest hits album (2007) and two concert tours: the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019). 
Bunton began her solo career with the release of her debut studio album, &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot; (2001), which debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The album spawned the successful singles &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot;, &quot;What I Am&quot; and &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;. Her second studio album, &quot;Free Me&quot; (2004), included the top-five single &quot;Free Me&quot;, and the top-ten singles &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. Bunton&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Life in Mono&quot; (2006), produced the successful single &quot;Downtown&quot;. In 2019, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;My Happy Place.&quot; 

Bunton has served as a judge on television talent shows, including &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; (2010–2011), &quot;Your Face Sounds Familiar&quot; (2013), and &quot;Boy Band&quot; (2017). She competed on the fourth series of the BBC One dancing show &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2006. From 2013 to 2018, Bunton was a co-presenter on the &quot;Heart Breakfast&quot; radio show in London alongside Jamie Theakston. As of December 2024, she currently presents her own show for Heart Radio on Sunday evenings.

==Early life and career beginnings==
Emma Lee Bunton was born on 21 January 1976 in Finchley, Barnet, London. Her parents, Pauline, a karate instructor, and Trevor Bunton, a milkman, split when she was 11, after which she stayed with her mother. She has a younger brother, Paul James. As stated in a TV interview with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on &quot;This Morning&quot; during August 2016, Bunton&#x27;s maternal family originate from County Wexford, Ireland. Bunton went to St Theresa&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School in Finchley.

She enrolled in the Sylvia Young Theatre School. At the SYTS, she became friendly with Keeley Hawes; they lived and travelled together for six months.

Bunton appeared briefly in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1992 as a mugger. In 1993, she appeared in the ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, and made a brief appearance as a prostitute in the BBC drama series &quot;To Play the King&quot;. Bunton also appeared in a 1999 public information film for the British government concerning firework safety.

== Music career ==

===1994–2000: Spice Girls===
In 1994, Melanie Chisholm, Melanie Brown, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Adams responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot;. Around 400 women who answered the ad went to Dance Works studios. Halliwell, Chisholm, Adams, and Brown were originally chosen as the members of the group, along with Michelle Stephenson, who due to her lack of commitment was briefly replaced by Abigail Kis, who was then replaced by Bunton. The group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them.

In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and A&amp;R men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush where they received an &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; reaction. Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for the group. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Adams&#x27; father Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group&#x27;s frustration at their management&#x27;s unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted with Heart Management. Bunton was the youngest member of the group.

The group began a relationship with Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment and finally signed with him in March 1995. During the summer of that year the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller and finally signed a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. From this point on, up to the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the United States, where they had signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific. On 8 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single &quot;Wannabe&quot; in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the video for &quot;Wannabe&quot;, got a trial airing on The Box music channel. &quot;Wannabe&quot; proved to be a major hit, topping the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and also topping the charts in a further 34 countries, including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany and the United States. and becoming the all-time biggest-selling single by an all-female group. It was followed by nine further number-one singles from their albums &quot;Spice&quot;, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot;. Each member of the group received a nickname from the media. Bunton was named &quot;Baby Spice&quot;.

Other successful releases followed, including &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; from &quot;Spice&quot;, and &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Viva Forever&quot; from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. In 1999, she presented &quot;Emma&quot; on VH1. She recorded&quot; (Hey You) Free Up Your Mind&quot; for the film &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot; and contributed background vocals to Melanie B&#x27;s song &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, which appeared as a B-side to her single &quot;Word Up&quot;. In November 1999, she released her debut single outside of her work with the Spice Girls, a cover of &quot;What I Am&quot; in collaboration with Tin Tin Out. In 2000, after the release of the group&#x27;s comeback single, a double A-side of &quot;Holler&quot;/&quot;Let Love Lead The Way&quot; and the third studio album, &quot;Forever&quot;, which charted at number two in the UK, the Spice Girls stopped recording, concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future.

===2001–2005: &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot; and &quot;Free Me&quot;===
Bunton&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2001 by Virgin Records. The album debuted and peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart, with 21,500 copies sold in its first week. Its lead single, &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot;, debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Although initial success was promising, &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot; fell down the chart quickly. However, the top five single &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, and top twenty &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Sleep Tonight&quot; helped the album stay on the UK Albums Chart for several weeks. On 7 September 2001, &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales in excess of 100,000 copies, ultimately becoming the 147th best-selling album in the United Kingdom for 2001. The album sold 125,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The poor sales led to Bunton losing her contract with Virgin in 2002. Bunton performed at Party at the Palace, an event that was held at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002 in commemoration of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Her solo performances at the event were a cover of The Supremes&#x27; 1964 hit &quot;Baby Love&quot; and her own &quot;What Took You So Long?&quot;.

After parting ways with Virgin, Bunton signed a new deal with 19 Recordings, run by former Spice Girls&#x27; manager Simon Fuller, to release her second album, &quot;Free Me&quot;, on 9 February 2004. The album was largely produced by Mike Peden and Yak Bondy. Other contributions on the album courtesy of Cathy Dennis, Henry Binns and Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi. Inspired by the Motown and the 1960s era, the album was widely acclaimed by critics by its &quot;charm and grace&quot;. It debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, spending over twelve weeks inside chart, and being certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album had three top five singles in the United Kingdom – the title track, &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; – and a top twenty single, &quot;Crickets Sing for Anamaria&quot;. In the United States, both &quot;Free Me&quot; and &quot;Maybe&quot; were dance club regulars, reaching numbers four and six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart respectively. In 2005, Bunton appeared in the Bollywood film &quot;&quot;.

===2006–2008: &quot;Life in Mono&quot; and Spice Girls reunion===

In October 2006, Bunton was a contestant in the BBC programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, partnered with Darren Bennett. She reached the semi-final and finished in third place. On 13 November 2006, Bunton released the charity single for the BBC Children in Need appeal, recording Petula Clark&#x27;s 1960s song &quot;Downtown&quot;. It reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, and was followed by her third studio album, &quot;Life in Mono&quot;. Much like her previous album, &quot;Life in Mono&quot; experimented with elements of 1960s pop music. For this particular album, the musical arrangement was more directed towards the 1960s French pop music, with some elements of British 1960s pop and Motown. The album was Bunton&#x27;s first not to reach the top ten in the United Kingdom, only reaching number 65 on the albums chart. The second single from it was &quot;All I Need to Know&quot;, released on 12 February 2007, intended for Valentine&#x27;s Day. Bunton shot the video around Old Street in East London, in the week before Christmas 2006. Entering the UK Singles Chart at number 60, &quot;All I Need to Know&quot; became the lowest-charting single of Bunton&#x27;s solo career.

In 2007, the Spice Girls re-grouped and announced plans to tour as a quintet for the last time for The Return of the Spice Girls, from which they were said to have earned £10 million each (approximately $20 million). The team&#x27;s members said that they were still enjoying doing their &quot;own thing&quot;. The group decided to release their first compilation album, a collection of their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. This album was released in early November 2007, and the tour began on 2 December 2007. During the reformation Film maker Bob Smeaton directed an official film of the tour, which he titled &quot;Spice Girls: Giving You Everything&quot;. As well as their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls were contracted to appear in Tesco advertisements, for which they were paid £1 million each.

===2010–2014: Spice Girls musical and Olympics===

Judy Craymer teamed up with the Spice Girls and Simon Fuller and began to develop a Spice Girls musical entitled &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. Although the girls were not to star in the show themselves, they were to influence the show&#x27;s cast and production choices in a story which uses their music but bears no relation to their personal story; similar to that of ABBA&#x27;s music in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;.
On 26 June 2012, all five Spice Girls were in attendance at a press conference in London to promote the launch of &quot;Viva Forever: The Musical&quot;. The press conference was held at St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, the location where the Spice Girls filmed the music video for their breakthrough hit &quot;Wannabe&quot;, sixteen years earlier, to the day. The musical opened at the West End&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre on 11 December 2012. After poor reviews from critics and &quot;a loss of £5 million&quot;, the show has its final performance on 29 June 2013.
On 12 August 2012, after much speculation, Bunton and the Spice Girls performed a medley of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, reuniting as a quintet for the last time for the event.

Their performance was the most tweeted moment of Olympics closing ceremony with over 116,000 tweets on Twitter per minute. Bunton also worked with fellow Spice Girl Melanie C on her 2012 album, &quot;Stages&quot; for the album track &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot;. The song was released as a single on 11 November 2012. In March 2013, Bunton was named the Foxy Bingo Celebrity Mum of the Year. In March 2014, Bunton, along with Melanie C, took part in recording England&#x27;s 2014 World Cup song. She collaborated with fellow pop stars Eliza Doolittle, Katy B, Conor Maynard, Kimberley Walsh and Pixie Lott on &quot;Greatest Day&quot;, a track originally performed by British band Take That. The track was produced by Gary Barlow and recorded at Sarm Studios in London. The track also featured past footballers such as Gary Lineker, Michael Owen, Geoff Hurst, David Seaman, Peter Shilton, Glenn Hoddle and Dion Dublin on backing vocals.

=== 2018–present: &quot;My Happy Place&quot; and second Spice Girls reunion===

In June 2018, Bunton said during an interview on &quot;This Morning&quot; that she was back in the studio working on new material, more than a decade after her last album, &quot;Life in Mono.&quot; Bunton told host Phillip Schofield, &quot;I am back in the studio, and I&#x27;m saying this here for the first time...I am in the studio having fun with some music of my own, just to see&quot;. In November 2018, Bunton announced she had signed a record deal with BMG Rights Management and was preparing a new album.

In September 2018, she voices the character Mama Bear in the UK version of the successful animated movie &quot;Smallfoot&quot;, starring Channing Tatum, James Corden, LeBron James and Danny DeVito. The movie is a success and grossed $83.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $130.9 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $214.1 million. In November 2018, Bunton reunited with the Spice Girls to announce a UK and Ireland Stadium tour, Spice World - 2019 Tour, which began at Croke Park, Dublin on 24 May 2019 and ended in London, England on 15 June 2019.

On 27 February 2019, she released the first single of the new album, &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, which received generally positive reviews. She later released a promo single, &quot;Too Many Teardrops&quot;, on 9 March 2019. She then released her duet with her partner Jade Jones, &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, a cover the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell song. On 12 April 2019, Bunton released her fourth album, &quot;My Happy Place&quot;. The tracklist consists of two original songs and eight covers of songs beloved by Bunton. The album, which featured appearances from Jones, Robbie Williams, Will Young and Josh Kumra, sold 6,500 copies in its first week in the UK, and entered the UK Album Chart at number 11. &quot;My Happy Place&quot; became her first Top 20 album in 15 years.
 She later released a promotional single, &quot;Too Many Teardrops&quot;, on 9 March 2019.

In November 2019, Bunton released a Christmas single, &quot;Coming Home For Christmas&quot;, which also included a cover of &quot;Santa Baby&quot;. On 6 December 2019, Bunton performed her first solo show in over a decade at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert was a special one-off Christmas show that featured Bunton performing well known Christmas covers as well as duets onstage with Will Young, Matt Goss and her fiancé Jade Jones. The inclusive theater company, Chickenshed, of which Bunton has been a patron for many years, also joined her onstage for a rendition of the Spice Girls song &quot;Mama&quot;.

<text>In physiology, thermoception or thermoreception is the sensation and perception of temperature, or more accurately, temperature differences inferred from heat flux. It deals with a series of events and processes required for an organism to receive a temperature stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal in order to trigger an appropriate response. Thermal stimuli may be noxious (posing a threat to the subject) or innocuous (no threat). The temperature sensitive proteins in thermoreceptors may also be activated by menthol or capsaicin, hence why these molecules evoke cooling and burning sensations, respectively.

A thermoreceptor may absorb heat via conduction, convection or radiation. However, the type of heat transfer is usually irrelevant to the functioning of a thermoceptor. Transient receptor potential channels (TRP channels) are believed to play a role in many species in sensation of hot, cold, and pain. Vertebrates have at least two types of thermoreceptors: those that detect heat and those that detect cold.

==Heat transfer==
Thermoception depends on the transfer of heat from the environment to the thermoreceptor. The transfer may be conductive, convective or radiative, but the method is irrelevant to the thermoceptor, which simply detects its own temperature, not that of the environment. The temperature of a thermoreceptor is the result of an energy balance between the heat flux from the environment and the heat dissipation to the rest of the body (or vice versa for cold detection). For example, a low-temperature metal, with high thermal conductivity may feel warmer than a high-temperature ceramic, with low thermal conductivity, because touching the metal results in a higher temperature of the thermoreceptor itself.

A thermoreceptor is a non-specialised sense receptor, or more accurately the receptive portion of a sensory neuron, that detects absolute and relative changes in temperature In mammals, temperature receptors innervate various tissues including the skin (as cutaneous receptors), cornea and urinary bladder. In warm receptors, warming results in an increase in their action potential discharge rate, while cooling results in a decrease in discharge rate. In cold receptors, their firing rate increases during cooling and decreases during warming.

=== Molecular basis ===
This area of research has recently received considerable attention with the identification and cloning of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of proteins. A number of ion channels are responsible for thermoception and activate at various temperatures so are therefore responsible for different types of thermal stimuli. TRPV1 is the primary channel associated with noxious heat sensing, as well as the detection of capsaicin. Innocuous warm sensation is mediated by activation of TRPM2. Innocuous cool sensation is mediated by activation of TRPM8. TRPA1 is sometimes sensitive to menthol and considered to be related to noxious cool sensation, but the mechanism is unclear.

The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2021 was attributed to David Julius (professor at the University of California, San Francisco, USA) and Ardem Patapoutian (neuroscience professor at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, USA) &quot;for their discovery of receptors for temperature and touch&quot;.

==In humans==
In humans, temperature sensation from thermoreceptors enters the spinal cord along the axons of Lissauer&#x27;s tract that synapse on second order neurons in grey matter of the dorsal horn. The axons of these second order neurons then decussate, joining the spinothalamic tract as they ascend to neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus.
A study in 2017 shows that the thermosensory information passes to the lateral parabrachial nucleus rather than to the thalamus and this drives thermoregulatory behaviour.

==Thermal vision==

Thermal vision is the ability to detect heat through radiative means. Vision specifically denotes the ability to not only detect heat but also form an image with that information. However, given the lack of knowledge or uncertainty of how an organism may interpret their thermoreceptor signals, any organism with organs specifically evolved for radiative thermoception are generally classed as thermal vision.

=== In snakes ===

Crotalinae (pit viper) and Boidae (boa) snakes can effectively see the infrared radiation emitted by hot objects. The snakes&#x27; face has a pair of holes, or pits, lined with temperature sensors. The sensors indirectly detect infrared radiation by its heating effect on the skin inside the pit. They can work out which part of the pit is hottest, and therefore the direction of the heat source, which could be a warm-blooded prey animal. By combining information from both pits, the snake can also estimate the distance of the object.

=== In vampire bats ===

The Common vampire bat has specialized infrared sensors in its nose-leaf. Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The infrared sense enables Desmodus to localize homeothermic (warm-blooded) animals (cattle, horses, wild mammals) within a range of about 10 to 15 cm. This infrared perception is possibly used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey.

===In other mammals===
Dogs, like vampire bats, can detect weak thermal radiation with their rhinaria (noses).

On February 14, 2013 researchers developed a neural implant that gives rats the ability to sense infrared light which for the first time provides living creatures with new abilities, instead of simply replacing or augmenting existing abilities.

=== In invertebrates ===
Other animals with specialized heat detectors are forest fire seeking beetles (&quot;Melanophila acuminata&quot;), which lay their eggs in conifers freshly killed by forest fires. Darkly pigmented butterflies &quot;Pachliopta aristolochiae&quot; and &quot;Troides rhadamantus&quot; use specialized heat detectors to avoid damage while basking. The blood sucking bugs &quot;Triatoma infestans&quot; may also have a specialised thermoception organ.

<doc id="241852" wikidata="Q1564825" url="?curid=241852" title="George Grossmith">
<text>George Grossmith (9 December 1847 – 1 March 1912) was an English comedian, writer, composer, actor, and singer. His performing career spanned more than four decades. As a writer and composer, he created 18 comic operas, nearly 100 musical sketches, some 600 songs and piano pieces, three books and both serious and comic pieces for newspapers and magazines.

Grossmith created a series of nine characters in the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan from 1877 to 1889, including Sir Joseph Porter, in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878), the Major-General in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1880) and Ko-Ko in &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885–87). He also wrote, in collaboration with his brother Weedon, the 1892 comic novel &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot;.

Grossmith was also famous in his day for performing his own comic piano sketches and songs, both before and after his Gilbert and Sullivan days, becoming the most popular British solo performer of the 1890s. Some of his comic songs endure today, including &quot;See Me Dance the Polka&quot;. He continued to perform into the first decade of the 20th century. His son, George Grossmith Jr., became an actor, playwright and producer of Edwardian musical comedies; another son, Lawrence, was an actor.

==Life and career==

===Early life===

George Grossmith was born in Islington, London, and grew up in St. Pancras and Hampstead, London. His father, also named George (1820–1880), was the chief reporter for &quot;The Times&quot; and other newspapers at the Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court and was also a lecturer and entertainer. His mother was Louisa Emmeline Grossmith née Weedon (d. 1882). Over the years, Grossmith&#x27;s father spent less of his time at Bow Street and more of it touring as a performer. As a young man, Grossmith was usually credited as &quot;Jnr&quot; to distinguish him from his father, especially when they performed together, but for most of his career, he was credited simply as &quot;George Grossmith&quot;. Later, his actor-playwright-theatre manager son was credited as George Grossmith &quot;Jr&quot; rather than &quot;III&quot;; some sources confuse the two men.

Grossmith had a younger sister, Emily, and younger brother, Weedon. In 1855, he went to boarding school at Massingham House on Haverstock Hill in the district of Hampstead. There he studied the piano and began to amuse his friends and teachers with shadow pantomimes, and later by playing the piano by ear. His family moved to Haverstock Hill when young Grossmith was 10, and he became a day student. At the age of 12, he transferred to the North London Collegiate School in Camden Town. He was back in St. Pancras by age 13. He was an avid amateur photographer and painter as a teenager, but it was his brother Weedon who went to art school. The Grossmith family had many friends engaged in the arts, including J. L. Toole, Ellen Terry, Henry Irving, H. J. Byron, Tom Hood, T. W. Robertson, and John Hollingshead (later, the manager of the Gaiety Theatre, London).

Grossmith had hoped to become a barrister. Instead, he worked for many years, beginning in the 1860s, training and then substituting for his father as the Bow Street reporter for &quot;The Times&quot;, among other publications, when his father was on his lecture tours. Among the cases on which he reported was the Clerkenwell bombing by the Fenians in 1867. At the same time as he began reporting, he began to write humorous articles for periodicals and to participate in amateur theatrical performances. He also joined his father in his entertainments, lectures, and imitations, and began to add music to the entertainments, which his father had not done.

===Early performing career===

Young Grossmith received some recognition for amateur songs and sketches at private parties and, beginning in 1864, at penny readings. He also participated in a small number of theatricals as an amateur, including playing John Chodd Jr. in Robertson&#x27;s play, &quot;Society&quot;, at the Gallery of Illustration, in 1868. The after-piece was a burlesque, written by Grossmith&#x27;s father, on the Dickens play &quot;No Thoroughfare&quot;. He then played the title role in &quot;Paul Pry&quot;, a comedy by Poole, also at the Gallery of Illustration, in 1870. But he and his father felt that his talents lay in &quot;sketch&quot; comedy rather than theatre. The younger Grossmith admired the comic pianist and entertainer John Orlando Parry, who created and performed in many of the German Reed Entertainments, and he tried to emulate Parry in developing his own sketches, consisting of humorous anecdotes, mildly satirical comment, ad lib chat, and comic songs centred on the piano.

Grossmith took to the professional stage in 1870 with a sketch called &quot;Human Oddities&quot;, written by his father, and a song called &quot;The Gay Photographer&quot; (that is, the &quot;carefree&quot; photographer). The song, with words by Grossmith&#x27;s father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke the heart of a young lady named Miss Jenkins; so she drank his chemicals and died. In late 1870, the younger Grossmith appeared on his own with a nightly spot at the &quot;old Polytechnic&quot; in Regent Street, where comic sketches alternated with scientific and serious lectures for the entertainment of the public. &quot;Human Oddities&quot; and another sketch, &quot;The Yellow Dwarf&quot;, were successful for Grossmith, and he took the former work on tour for six months. An 1871 Grossmith sketch was called &quot;He was a Careful Man&quot;. Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith&#x27;s material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. Joseph describes the sketches as &quot;a light-hearted sending up of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing—he had it all. A short, dapper figure, he turned his lack of inches to positive advantage, and audiences took to him everywhere.&quot;
Grossmith toured in the summer of 1871 with Mr and Mrs Howard Paul and occasionally afterwards. He and Mrs Paul would also appear together in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; in 1877. Also in 1871, at the Polytechnic, he performed three more sketches, &quot;The Puddleton Penny Readings&quot;, &quot;Theatricals at Thespis Lodge&quot; and &quot;The Silver Wedding&quot; (including what would be one of his most popular songs, &quot;I am so Volatile&quot;, with words by his father). On 14 February 1872, Grossmith gave a sketch parody of a penny reading at the Gaiety Theatre, London, since on Ash Wednesday, theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for the holiday. At the time, coincidentally, the Gaiety was presenting &quot;Thespis&quot;, Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s first collaboration. Throughout these years, Grossmith continued working at Bow Street during the day. In 1873, Grossmith married Emmeline Rosa Noyce (1849–1905), the daughter of a neighbourhood physician, whom he had met years earlier at a children&#x27;s party. The couple had four children: George, an actor, playwright and theatre manager; Sylvia (1875–1932; married Stuart James Bevan in 1900); Lawrence, an actor, primarily in America; and Cordelia Rosa (1879–1943). The family lived initially in Marylebone before moving, about 1885, to Dorset Square nearby.

In 1873, Grossmith and his father began joint tours of humorous recitations and comic sketches at literary institutes and public halls, to church groups and to branches of the YMCA all over England and even in Scotland and Wales. Young Grossmith&#x27;s sketches at this time included &quot;The Puddleton Penny Readings&quot;, &quot;Our Choral Society&quot; and &quot;In the Stalls&quot;. They toured almost constantly for the following three years, but they returned to see their families in London on weekends. Around this time, he met and became firm friends with Fred Sullivan, and afterwards, he met Sullivan&#x27;s brother Arthur. Through Arthur Cecil, Sullivan, and some of their friends, Grossmith began to be invited to entertain at private &quot;society&quot; parties, which he continued to do throughout his career. Later, these parties would often occur late in the evening after Grossmith performed at the Savoy Theatre. In 1876, he collaborated with Florence Marryat, the author and reciter, on &quot;Entre Nous&quot;. This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person &quot;satirical musical sketch&quot;, really a short comic opera, called &quot;Cups and Saucers&quot;, which they then toured. Grossmith also took a number of engagements, including recitals at private homes. In 1877, Lionel Brough introduced another popular Grossmith song, &quot;The Muddle Puddle Junction Porter&quot;. By then, Grossmith had become friendly with many in the music and theatre establishments, including Arthur Sullivan and impresario Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte; and Grossmith had the opportunity to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Trial by Jury&quot; and other Sullivan works at charity benefits.
After entertaining professionally in sketch comedy for seven years, however, Grossmith discovered that his income decreased each year as his family and household expenses increased. He also disliked travelling. Accordingly, he was pleased when, despite his relative inexperience in legitimate theatre, he received a letter from Arthur Sullivan in November 1877 inviting him to take a part in his new piece with W. S. Gilbert: &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;.

===D&#x27;Oyly Carte years===
Grossmith had appeared in charity performances of &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, where both Sullivan and Gilbert had seen him (indeed, Gilbert had directed one such performance, in which Grossmith played the judge), and Gilbert had earlier commented favourably on his performance in Tom Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Society&quot; at the Gallery of Illustration. Sullivan mentioned to Arthur Cecil, the leading tenor from the Gallery of Illustration, that he was looking for someone to play the comic title role in his new comic opera, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. Cecil reminded Sullivan about Grossmith, and Sullivan seized on the idea. After singing for Sullivan, upon meeting Gilbert, Grossmith wondered aloud if the role should be played by &quot;a fine man with a fine voice&quot;. Gilbert replied, &quot;That is exactly what we don&#x27;t want.&quot; Although Grossmith had reservations about cancelling his touring engagements and going into the &quot;wicked&quot; professional theatre (a move that might lose him church and other engagements in the future), and Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s backers objected to casting a sketch comedian in the central role of a comic opera, Grossmith was hired.
Grossmith was a hit as the tradesmanlike John Wellington Wells, the title role in &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;, and became a regular member of Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s company. He created all nine of the lead comic baritone roles in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s Savoy Operas in London from 1877 to 1889, including the pompous First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter, in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (1878); Major-General Stanley in &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, who is an expert at everything except &quot;military knowledge&quot; (1880); the aesthetic poet, Reginald Bunthorne in &quot;Patience&quot; (1881); the love-lonely Lord Chancellor in &quot;Iolanthe&quot; (1882); the sarcastic cripple, King Gama, in &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884); Ko-Ko the cheap tailor, elevated to the post of Lord High Executioner, in &quot;The Mikado&quot; (1885); the accursed Robin Oakapple in &quot;Ruddigore&quot; (1887); and the pathetic jester, Jack Point, in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (1888). On 29 January 1887, one week after the opening night of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, Grossmith fell dangerously ill. However, by 13 February, his physicians pronounced him convalescent, and he resumed the role of Robin by 18 February. During Grossmith&#x27;s absence, his understudy Henry Lytton, who would later become the principal comedian of the company, had the opportunity to perform the role in Grossmith&#x27;s place.
Years later, Grossmith&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; noted the comedian&#x27;s &quot;nimbleness, his diverting tricks, his still more diverting dignity—the dignity of a man of few inches high or round—and his incomparable power of rapid speech and singing.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote of his Jack Point: &quot;Whether giving expression to poor Jack’s professional wit, or hiding a sorry heart behind light words... Mr Grossmith was master of the part he assumed.&quot; In 1883, &quot;The Times&quot;, reviewing a matinee performance of &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, wrote: &quot;Mr. Grossmith&#x27;s impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire.&quot; On the other hand, his sketch comedy background had trained Grossmith to improvise comic business. Gilbert and the actor had an exchange during rehearsals for &quot;The Mikado&quot; about an improvised moment in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and he rolled completely over. Gilbert requested that they cut out the gag, and Grossmith replied: &quot;but I get an enormous laugh by it&quot;. Gilbert replied &quot;So you would if you sat on a pork-pie.&quot;

The actor, jittery on opening nights, is depicted both on and off stage in the biographical film, &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot;. Hesketh Pearson wrote in 1935 that Grossmith injected himself with drugs to calm his nerves, and in the film he is shown injecting himself on the opening night of &quot;The Mikado&quot;. In his diary, Arthur Sullivan wrote afterwards, &quot;All went very well except Grossmith, whose nervousness nearly upset the piece&quot;. Grossmith spoke self-deprecatingly about his own vocal prowess (Sullivan and others disagreed):
:Of course, I haven&#x27;t any voice to speak of, but I have a great register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. In &quot;Ruddygore&quot;, Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an enormous bass voice, and who had to go down to the lower E flat. Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [low E-flat] below. Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.
During his time with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company, Grossmith&#x27;s father and mother died (in 1880 and 1882, respectively). Throughout this period, Grossmith continued to perform his sketches, often late at night after performing at the Savoy, and continued to write new sketches, such as &quot;Amateur Theatricals&quot; (1878), &quot;A Juvenile Party&quot; (1879), &quot;A Musical Nightmare&quot; (1880), and &quot;A Little Yachting&quot; (1886). He also wrote the music for Arthur Law&#x27;s short comic opera, &quot;Uncle Samuel&quot; (1881), the one-act curtain raiser that preceded &quot;Patience&quot; on the Opera Comique programme. His &quot;Cups and Saucers&quot; was revived and played with &quot;Pinafore&quot; and also played by the company on tour. Other comic operas by Grossmith during these years included &quot;Mr Guffin&#x27;s Elopement&quot; (1882) and &quot;A Peculiar Case&quot; (1884, both with libretti by Arthur Law) and &quot;The Real Case of Hide and Seekyll&quot; (1886). Grossmith also continued to give his &quot;society&quot; and other entertainments, often late at night after his performance at the Savoy. He also composed the music for another comic opera, &quot;The Great Tay-Kin&quot; and another piece, both with libretti by Arthur Law, which were performed at Toole&#x27;s Theatre in 1885.

Grossmith also wrote, composed, and performed in several one-man drawing room sketches, short comic operas or monologues that were given at the Opera Comique or the Savoy Theatre in place of the companion pieces when shorter matinee programmes were playing. These works included &quot;Beauties on the Beach&quot; (1878), &quot;Five Hamlets&quot; (1878), a revival of his &quot;A Silver Wedding&quot; (1879), &quot;The Drama on Crutches&quot; (1883), &quot;Homburg, or Haunted by The Mikado&quot; (1887–88), and &quot;Holiday Hall&quot; (1888). In reviewing a matinee performance of &quot;The Drama on Crutches&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;he not only satirizes the present tendency of fashionable amateurs to join the stage, but also parodies ... the manner of Mr. Irving and other actors of the present day, including himself. The sketch created great amusement, though of course, it depends entirely for its success upon the actor&#x27;s powers of mimicry.&quot; Grossmith also performed in charity events, including as Bouncer in &quot;Cox and Box&quot; in 1879 at the Opera Comique.
In addition, Grossmith&#x27;s comic song written in 1886, &quot;See Me Dance the Polka&quot;, was extremely popular. It has been used in a number of films and has been quoted or referred to in literature and music, including in the poem/song &quot;Polka&quot; from &quot;Façade&quot; by Edith Sitwell and William Walton. Other songs he wrote during this period include &quot;An Awful Little Scrub&quot; (1880), &quot;The Speaker&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1882), &quot;The &#x27;Bus Conductor&#x27;s Song&quot; (1883), &quot;How I Became an Actor&quot; (1883), &quot;See Me Reverse&quot; (1884), &quot;The Lost Key&quot; (1885), and &quot;The Happy Fatherland&quot; (1887).

===Later years===
Grossmith left the D&#x27;Oyly Carte company near the end of the original run of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; on 17 August 1889 and resumed his career entertaining at the piano, which he continued to do for more than 15 years afterwards. Despite his dislike of travelling, he toured in Britain, Ireland, and, on five occasions, North America. His drawing-room sketches included his own popular songs, such as &quot;See Me Dance the Polka&quot;, &quot;The Happy Fatherland&quot;, &quot;The Polka and the Choir-boy&quot;, &quot;Thou of My Thou&quot;, &quot;The French Verbs&quot;, &quot;Go on Talking – Don&#x27;t Mind Me&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Mind Flies&quot;. His new sketches during this period included &quot;Modern Music and Morals&quot; (1889), &quot;On Tour; or, Piano and I&quot; (1891), &quot;A Seaside Holiday&quot; (1892), &quot;Fashionable Music&quot; (1892) and &quot;Is Music a Failure?&quot; (1892). According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;His genial satire was enjoyed even by those at whom its shafts were aimed.&quot; When he toured Scotland in the autumn of 1890, Grossmith gave a command performance for Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle. He also composed the music for a three-act comic opera with a libretto by Gilbert, &quot;Haste to the Wedding&quot; (1892). In this piece, his son George Grossmith Jr. made his stage debut. Musically more challenging than any composition he had attempted before, this work was unsuccessful. Later, however, Grossmith said that the experience of writing with Gilbert was one of the happiest of his life. In 1892–93 he toured North America (his second tour there), writing successful new sketches, &quot;How I Discovered America&quot; and &quot;Baby on the Shore&quot; (1893).
In 1892, Grossmith collaborated with his brother Weedon Grossmith to expand a series of amusing columns they had written in 1888–89 for &quot;Punch&quot;. &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; was published as a novel and has never been out of print since. The book is a sharp analysis of social insecurity, and Charles Pooter of The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, was immediately recognised as one of the great comic characters of English literature. The work has itself been the object of dramatisation and adaptation, including three times for television: 1964, 1979 and 2007.
Grossmith had become the most popular solo entertainer of his day, and his tours earned him far more than he had earned while performing with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. He also continued to compose music, including the comic opera &quot;Castle Bang&quot; (1894) and the sketches &quot;The Ibsenite Drama&quot; (1895) and &quot;Do We Enjoy Our Holidays?&quot; (1897) and songs like &quot;The Baby on the Shore&quot; (1893), &quot;Johnnie at the Gaiety&quot; (1895), &quot;Tommy&#x27;s First Love&quot; (1897), and &quot;The Happy Old Days at Peckham&quot; (1903). In 1894–95, however, Gilbert enticed Grossmith to take the role of George Griffenfeld in &quot;His Excellency&quot;, with music by Frank Osmond Carr. Also in 1897, he played briefly as King Ferdinand V of Vingolia in F. C. Burnand&#x27;s &quot;His Majesty&quot; at the Savoy Theatre and made two more short London stage appearances thereafter, as Scoones in &quot;Young Mr Yarde&quot; (1898) and Lambert Simnel in &quot;The Gay Pretenders&quot; (1900). An 1896 interview of Grossmith reveals him feeling his age and considering the end of his touring career, while enjoying time spent at home with his family, dogs and antique piano collection. 

Grossmith suffered from depression after the death of his wife of cancer in 1905, and his health began to fail, so that he increasingly missed engagements. He was nevertheless persuaded to continue giving his entertainments, which he did on a less frequent basis, until November 1908. The following year, Grossmith retired to Folkestone, Kent, a town that he had visited for many years, where he wrote his second volume of reminiscences, &quot;Piano and I&quot; (1910).

Grossmith died at his home in Folkestone at the age of 64. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, in the London Borough of Brent. In his will, dated 26 October 1908, Grossmith left small bequests to a variety of charities and persons; 2,000 pounds, artworks and heirlooms to each of his children (except that Lawrence did not receive a cash bequest), his son George receiving also &quot;two silver bowls presented to him by [Gilbert, Sullivan and] Carte [and] the ivory baton with which he conducted the orchestra on the occasion of his said son&#x27;s first appearance on the stage&quot; in &quot;Haste to the Wedding&quot;; and smaller bequests to his children&#x27;s spouses and his nieces, nephews, grandchildren and some cousins, with the residuary estate shared equally by his children (although the residuary estate was not large).

==Writings and compositions; legacy; recordings==

Grossmith wrote numerous comic pieces for the magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, including a series of ten skits in 1884 inspired by his Bow Street experiences, which he called &quot;Very Trying&quot;. He also wrote two memoirs, &quot;A Society Clown: Reminiscences &quot; (1888) and &quot;Piano and I: Further Reminiscences&quot; (1910). In his career, Grossmith wrote 18 comic operas, nearly 100 musical sketches, some 600 songs and piano pieces, and three books. He also wrote both serious and comic pieces for newspapers and magazines throughout his career, displaying a wide range of styles.

Grossmith was followed, in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic roles, by a number of other popular performers; those who played his roles at the Savoy Theatre for an extended period of time have included Henry Lytton, Martyn Green, Peter Pratt and John Reed, among others. Over forty of the songs that Grossmith wrote or performed in his one-man shows have been recorded by baritone Leon Berger (a British Gilbert &amp; Sullivan singer and Grossmith scholar), accompanied by Selwyn Tillett (G&amp;S scholar) on two CDs: &quot;A Society Clown: The Songs of George Grossmith&quot; and &quot;The Grossmith Legacy&quot;. The latter also contains the recorded voice of Grossmith&#x27;s son, George Grossmith Jr. Both are on the Divine Art Label. No recordings of Grossmith&#x27;s voice are known to exist, although wax cylinder recording technology was available during his lifetime. &quot;Cups and Saucers&quot; was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, together with F. C. Burnand and Edward Solomon&#x27;s &quot;Pickwick&quot;.

===Portrayals===
Grossmith was portrayed by Martyn Green in the 1953 film &quot;The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; and by Martin Savage in the 1999 film &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;. Simon Butteriss portrayed Grossmith in the 2006 television documentary &quot;A Salaried Wit: Grossmith, Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; and in the five-part 2015 &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; &quot;I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General&quot; on BBC Radio 4. Butteriss also presents a documentary about Grossmith as a bonus disc to the 2010 Sky Arts DVD set, &quot;A Motley Pair&quot;. Many of Grossmith&#x27;s songs have been recorded by baritone Leon Berger.

John Reed played Grossmith in Melvyn Morrow&#x27;s one-man biographical musical &quot;A Song to Sing, O&quot; at the Savoy Theatre in 1981. The same role was later played in Australia by Anthony Warlow in 1987, Dennis Olsen in 1991 and by Butteriss at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in Buxton in 2003.

<text>Speedo International Limited is an Australian-British distributor of swimwear and swim-related accessories based in Nottingham, England.

Founded in Sydney, Australia in 1914 by Alexander MacRae, a Scottish emigrant, the company is now a subsidiary of the British Pentland Group. Today, the Speedo brand can be found on products ranging from swimsuits and goggles to wristwatches. The Speedo brand was previously manufactured for and marketed in North America as Speedo USA by PVH, under an exclusive perpetual licence, which had acquired prior licensee Warnaco Group in 2013. In January 2020, the Pentland Group purchased back the rights from PVH for $170 million in cash, subject to regulatory approval.

In accordance with its Australian roots, Speedo uses a boomerang as its symbol. Due to its success in the swimwear industry, the word &quot;Speedo&quot; has become a generic trademark for racing bathing suits.

== History ==

=== Speedo Knitting Mills ===

Company founder Alexander MacRae emigrated from Loch Kishorn in the western Highlands of Scotland to Sydney, Australia in 1910. Originally working as a milkman, he founded &quot;MacRae and Company Hosiery&quot; four years later, manufacturing underwear under the brand name &quot;Fortitude&quot; (taken from his family crest). The Australian Army&#x27;s need for socks during World War I provided MacRae with enough business to expand and in 1927 his first line of swimwear, called a &quot;racer-back costume&quot; was introduced. The following year, a naming contest held among the MacRae staff yielded the slogan &quot;Speed on in your Speedos.&quot; The brand name was born. The contest winner, Captain Parsonson, was awarded £5 for his slogan and the company was renamed &quot;Speedo Knitting Mills&quot;.

The controversial yet revolutionary racerback style&#x27;s open shoulder and exposed back allowed greater range of motion in water and was quickly adopted by competitive swimmers, despite being banned by some beaches. In 1932, Speedo made its Olympic debut when 16-year old Australian Clare Dennis won the Women&#x27;s 200 metre Breaststroke at the Los Angeles Olympic Games. After nearly being disqualified for &quot;showing too much shoulder&quot; in her regulation silk Speedo brand swimsuit, Dennis went on to set a world record time of 3:06.3. The 1936 Berlin Summer Games also saw some controversy as the men&#x27;s Australian swim team featured shirtless swim trunks for the first time. Also in 1936, Alexander MacRae became involved in the Surf Life Saving Association. To this day, Speedo continues to support the Australian volunteer organisation.

=== Post-War expansion ===
After devoting most of its resources to the War effort during World War II, Speedo enjoyed a great post-war demand for swimsuits, specifically the recently invented bikini style. The company quickly reestablished itself as a leader in swimwear manufacturing and once again drew controversy when its two-piece was banned by Australian beach inspectors. In 1951, Speedo Knitting Mills (Holdings) Ltd. incorporated and went public, selling its stock on the Sydney Stock Exchange. In 1955, nylon was used for the first time in the company&#x27;s swimsuits and the next year, the increasingly popular swimsuit brand returned to the Olympics when its home country hosted the Melbourne Summer Games. The Speedo sponsored Australian men&#x27;s swim team took home eight gold medals and brought a new worldwide level of notoriety to the company which debuted the swim briefs that would become synonymous with the brand name. By 1957, Speedo had the exclusive licence to manufacture and distribute Jockey brand men&#x27;s underwear in Australia. The company finished off the 1950s by exporting to the United States and exploring potential opportunities in South America, Europe, New Zealand and Japan.

The end of the 1950s also saw the beginning of a long-lasting business partnership which continues to this day. In 1958, Speedo began the manufacture of American Warnaco&#x27;s White Stag ski-wear line. In exchange, in 1961, White Stag became the exclusive US distributor of Speedo swimwear. Through White Stag, Speedo&#x27;s product line expanded to include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sportswear. By the middle of the 1960s, Speedo had acquired 30% of Nottingham, England textile manufacturer Robert Shaw &amp; Company and had established a European subsidiary. Licences were also granted to Japanese and South American corporations. The 1968 Mexico City Summer Olympics saw 27 of the 29 gold medalists—22 of which set world records—wearing Speedo brand swimsuits.

Speedo began the next decade by completing its acquisition of Robert Shaw &amp; Company in 1971. The 1970s also saw the company pioneer the use of elastane (spandex) and the brand&#x27;s use in Olympic record breaking continued at the 1972 Munich and 1976 Montreal games, the latter of which Speedo was an official swimwear licensee.

On Australia Day, 26 January 1981 the Australian Institute of Sport opened in Canberra, with Speedo as its first official sponsor. Also early in the decade, Speedo provided equipment and training to China to aid the communist country&#x27;s return to the Olympics for first time since 1958. Throughout the decade, the brand expanded its reach in Europe by licensing production in Italy, Spain, Sweden and other nations, bringing its total distribution to 112 countries.

=== Modern technology ===
In 1990, British sportswear firm Pentland Group, which had just sold its shares of sneaker company Reebok, acquired a significant stake in Warnaco offshoot Authentic Fitness, which was the exclusive North American licensee of Speedo. Pentland followed this move with the purchase of 80% of Speedo (Europe) Ltd. Early the next year, Pentland completed its aggressive entrance into the global swimwear market by wholly acquiring Speedo Australia and Speedo International. Under Pentland&#x27;s ownership, Speedo expanded its line of swimwear to include more fashion-oriented beachwear as well as triathlon accessories.
The 1990s saw the creation of the low-drag S2000 suit, the chlorine resistant Endurance line as well as the Aquablade series which was worn by more than three-fourths of medal winners at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Games.

Speedo began the 21st century with the introduction of its Fastskin swimsuit and, again, broke world records when the Summer Games returned to the swimwear leader&#x27;s home town. The company website boasts that 13 out of the 15 swimming records broken in the 2000 Sydney Olympics were by athletes wearing Speedo. Three years later, Speedo celebrated its 75th anniversary with special limited edition lines endorsed by Jerry Hall, Naomi Campbell and others. In 2004, Michael Phelps wore the Fastskin II, the latest evolution of the Fastskin series, in Athens to become the first swimmer to earn eight medals. Phelps followed up this performance four years later, earning eight golds at Beijing, while wearing Speedo&#x27;s LZR Racer suit In 2010, the company launched Speedo Sculpture ShapeLine, a new line of body-shaping swimsuits for women.

== Products ==

Although the brand name Speedo is often genericised to refer to any style of men&#x27;s swim briefs, these account for less than 2% of the company&#x27;s sales. The Speedo name can be found on a wide range of swimsuit styles for men, women, and children focusing on performance and style. Speedo also offers a range of sportswear, footwear, and accessories ranging from swim goggles to electronics. Additionally, Speedo International offers a line of men&#x27;s underwear and Speedo Australia features a line of underwear called &quot;Speedo Underbody&quot; for men and women, sold only in select David Jones retail stores.

=== Accessories ===
Speedo offers a broad range of swim accessories including more than seventy models of goggles, several models of watches, sunglasses, and towels. In addition, Speedo offers several lines of aquatic fitness aids and swim aids for children and adults as well as scuba masks, snorkels and swimfins. Speedo International offers a line of beach games equipment not offered on the SpeedoUSA website.

=== Footwear ===
The Speedo brand can be found on a wide variety of footwear including sandals, flip-flops, and water shoes. Speedo USA offers waterproof sneakers for aqua fitness training.

=== Speedo Digital ===
The Speedo Digital line of accessories includes the waterproof Aquabeat and LZR Racer Aquabeat digital music players and related accessories, which are manufactured by South Korean consumer electronics company Iriver. Speedo&#x27;s electronics offerings also include the Auquashot waterproof digital camera.

=== Speedos Café ===
== Swimwear ==
Speedo USA&#x27;s men&#x27;s collections are categorised as: Competition, Racing, Boardshorts and Swim Trunks, Fashion, and Lifeguard. Speedo International&#x27;s men&#x27;s offerings also include wetsuits. Both Speedo USA and Speedo International also offer a wide range of children&#x27;s styles including performance, racing, fashion and beginner lines.

=== Controversial technology ===
Swim records were broken in Speedo brand silk suits in the 1930s, and the company was the first to introduce the use of nylon in the 1950s and later nylon/elastane in the 1970s. Speedo&#x27;s most recent technological advances are found in the Fastskin, Fastskin FS II series and the LZR Racer suit. Throughout the company&#x27;s history, though, it seemed each design innovation was met with great controversy. Clare Dennis was nearly disqualified from her record-breaking Olympic meet because her suit showed too much skin; early Speedo bikinis were banned from some Australian beaches; more recently, the NASA technology in the LZR Racer suit Michael Phelps wore at the Beijing Olympics was the subject of great media scrutiny.

==== Fastskin ====
In 2000, British designer and former competitive swimmer Fiona Fairhurst was named as a finalist for European Inventor of the Year. Fairhurst helped Speedo&#x27;s Aqualab design team invent the first-of-its-kind Fastskin swimsuit. Inspired by the varying skin texture of a shark, Fairhurst told the BBC that she was &quot;looking to develop a fabric that mimics nature&quot;. Both the Fastskin and Fastkskin FS II are textured with bumps and ridges in key places, similar to those on a shark&#x27;s skin. These ridges are claimed to channel the water over the swimmer&#x27;s body in a more efficient manner than traditional material suits. However, research in 2012 has suggested that the artificial sharkskin patterning does not benefit human swimmers, whose body movement is different from sharks.

In addition, the suits are custom designed for the type of stroke the swimmer will use as well as being engineered differently for women and for men. These high-tech suits make use of elastic compression materials to limit muscle oscillation and to compress the swimmer&#x27;s body, while in other areas a more flexible fabric is used to allow greater range of motion. Leaving no detail overlooked, the design team also uses low-profile seams. According to author Frank Vizard, the Fastskin suits reduce drag by up to four per cent. Speedo adapted this new fabric technology for the 2006 Winter Olympics. The full-bodied Fastskin FSII Ice suits were debuted by the silver medal winning American women&#x27;s bobsled team.

By the time the bobsledders were given the opportunity to don their Fastskin suits, the line had already gone through several evolutions including the Fastskin FS-II and Fastskin FS-Pro. From the very beginning, these drag reducing suits were met with great resistance. At issue was Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) rule 10.7, which stated &quot;No swimmer shall use any device that may aid his speed, buoyancy, or endurance during a competition (such as webbed gloves, flippers, fins etc). Goggles may be worn&quot;. Early in 2000, Speedo hand-delivered their new Fastskin suits to 150 Olympic hopefuls and promised 6,000 more would be made available for Olympic trials. Fearing the possibility of Speedo-clad race winners being stripped of medals due to challenges, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport to examine the legality of the FINA-sanctioned suits. In May that year, a CAS-appointed arbitrator backed the FINA ruling allowing use of the suits for Olympic tryouts. Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates, however, said in a press conference that their swimmers would be allowed to wear the futuristic neck to ankle covering suits, but would do so &quot;at their own risk&quot;. Coates later stated that the ruling he sought was whether the suits should be classified as costumes or devices.

Professor Emeritus of Exercise and Nutritional sciences at San Diego State University, Brent S. Rushall claimed in a report sent to CAS that the suits were – by FINA&#x27;s definition and based on manufacturer&#x27;s claims – in fact devices, rather than costumes and are therefore in violation of the FINA rule, which disallows equipment such as fins or flippers. In the report, Rushall equally criticises Adidas (who had a similarly designed bodysuit) and Speedo for giving FINA members &quot;presents&quot; and declares that these members should recuse themselves from ruling on the legality of these suits.

Ultimately, the suits were approved for use in the Sydney Olympics and in December 2000 the super-suit earned a place on &quot;Popular Science&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Best of What&#x27;s New&quot;, alongside the US Navy&#x27;s F-16 replacement and Kodak&#x27;s Smart Digital Picture Frame with built-in modem.

Four years later, the FSII debuted in the Athens summer games. While this next stage in swimwear evolution was quickly approved by FINA, it was not without controversy. Speedo competitor TYR developed a similar full body suit with detached sleeves, which the company calls Aqua Bands. Both TYR&#x27;s detached Aqua bands and Speedo FSII&#x27;s attached sleeves are designed to essentially &quot;grip&quot; the water on the inner forearm. TYR maintained that essentially the only difference between their suit and Speedo&#x27;s was whether the sleeves were attached. Despite this, FINA did not approve TYR&#x27;s armbands. In 2004, 47 medals were won by swimmers wearing Fastskin II.

In late 2011, in time for the holiday season, Speedo introduced a new Fastskin3 suit. This suit comes in two styles, Elite and Super Elite. Speedo developed the Fastskin3 as a racing &quot;system&quot;, consisting of a newly introduced cap, goggles, and competition suit. Michael Phelps is the principal advertiser for the Fastskin3 line of suits, as Ryan Lochte has been reported to prefer the older Fastskin LZR Elite suits. In succession to the LZR Pro and Elite, Speedo switched the branding for their technical suits from &quot;Fastskin LZR Racer&quot; to &quot;Fastskin&quot;, continuing the trend they left off in 2008 when they debuted the LZR Racer. The male suit is available as a normal-cut suit and a high-waisted suit that utilises the space in between the belly button and waist of the male swimmer. The core of Speedo&#x27;s advertising campaign for the new line touted the benefits of &quot;becoming one&quot; with the suit. Speedo advertises up to 16.6% drag reduction and 11% improved oxygen economy. The system was sold featuring &quot;fit point markers&quot;, allowing the swimmer to line up the suit, cap, and goggles to achieve an ideal fit and appearance. FINA approved this suit shortly after it was launched, and the suit was anticipated to be used at the London 2012 Olympics by a majority of athletes, along with the Arena PowerSkin Carbon Pro suit, which debuted in early 2012. However, a series of high-profile seam failures and high costs for poor performance gain meant that the suit was a commercial failure. Most swimmers, including Phelps, ended up using a revamped version of the LZR Elite. The cap and a cut-down version of the &quot;Super Elite&quot; goggles are still sold today.

As of the Rio 2016 Olympics, Speedo&#x27;s lineup of suits consisted of its flagship &quot;LZR Racer X&quot;, known for an &quot;x&quot; pattern of silver kinetic taping; a second generation Elite dubbed the &quot;LZR Elite 2&quot;; and an entry-level &quot;LZR Pro&quot;. The LZR X performed slightly better than the FS3 in terms of swimmer preference, but Speedo failed to capture much attention at the Games as Mizuno, a Japanese manufacturer, had introduced a new suit (the &quot;GX-Sonic III&quot;) designed to circumvent the FINA regulations and aid the swimmer in new ways. Specifically, the Mizuno suit comes in two variants: a sprinter (&quot;ST&quot;) variant with stiff taping on the inside of the suit along the hamstrings, designed to help the upbeat of a kick at the end of a race as a swimmer&#x27;s energy fades, while the multi-racer (&quot;MR&quot;) uses two layers of the FINA-approved textile to decrease air permeability drastically, thereby trapping considerable excess air and making a swimmer more buoyant just like with the original LZR Racer (see below). Not much marketing material has appeared in the West, as the GX-Sonic has only been primarily aimed at the small Japanese market and required special importing internationally, so there are no numerical performance claims available, but many unsigned standout swimmers like Joseph Schooling (since signed by Speedo), Caeleb Dressel (since signed by Speedo), and Anthony Ervin (signed by Finis but allowed to choose his own suit) chose to wear the Mizuno suit over any of Speedo&#x27;s offerings and won many golds in that suit. Additionally, the de facto trademark appearance of some collegiate teams like the Texas Longhorns at the NCAA National Championships is in Mizuno now, as opposed to Speedo.

To combat the rapid uprise of choosing Mizuno among high-performing swimmers, Speedo released a new lineup of suits in 2019, in advance of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Dubbed the &quot;LZR PURE&quot; collection, the lineup consists of two suits: a new high-end LZR Pure Intent, designed to replace the LZR Racer X, borrowing many technologies like hamstring taping from Mizuno&#x27;s suits, and intended to compete with Mizuno&#x27;s ST variant of their GX-Sonic series; and a flexible LZR Pure Valor, designed to replace the LZR Elite 2 and compete with the dual-layered MR variant of the GX-Sonic series. Speedo has also released new goggles and a rebranded FS3 cap to go along with the launch.

==== LZR Racer ====
Speedo&#x27;s most controversial move came with 2008&#x27;s unveiling of the LZR (pronounced &quot;laser&quot;) Racer. The super smooth suit, which was optimised with the help of NASA wind tunnels, uses welded seams and multiple woven fabrics to reduce drag by up to six per cent. In addition, the LZR, like the Fastskin, utilises a core stabiliser, which acts almost as a girdle, to reduce muscle movement. This was designed to help the swimmer maintain the proper angle in the water for longer periods of time. &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine named the suit one of their &quot;100 Best of What&#x27;s New &#x27;08&quot; list, calling it &quot;The fastest swimsuit in the world&quot;. Subsequent research revealed another reason for the suit&#x27;s success: tiny air bubbles tended to be trapped between the swimmer&#x27;s body and the suit, lifting the swimmer slightly so that they benefited from lower friction against air as compared to water.

Speedo&#x27;s website boasts that the LZR Racer was &quot;so fast, it was banned from competition&quot;. Indeed, the LZR Racer was banned from international competition by FINA in 2009, along with all full-body polyurethane suits. Men&#x27;s suits were also banned from extending above the waist or below the knee. Women&#x27;s suits could not extend past the shoulders or go below the knee. 
However, by that time, swimmers wearing the suit had already broken at least 46 world records.

FINA&#x27;s ban on the LZR Racer and all &quot;hi-tech&quot; suits came shortly before Michael Phelps&#x27;s 200 meter freestyle loss to Germany&#x27;s Paul Biedermann at the 2009 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Italy. Wearing Arena&#x27;s polyurethane X-Glide suit, Biedermann broke two world records that day and beat Phelps by more than one second. Even though FINA had already approved the ban, it had not been scheduled to go into effect until the following spring. The delay in FINA&#x27;s hi-tech prohibition and Phelps&#x27;s unexpected second-place finish (his first loss since 2005) led Phelps&#x27;s coach Bob Bowman to threaten a boycott of international swim competitions. In the first three days of the eight-day competition, 15 world records were set.

The vague decision by swimming&#x27;s governing body stated that suit materials would need to be textile, rather than polymer-based, but offered no specific deadline for this changeover to occur.
 The reason for the delay, FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu told the AP, is to give manufacturers enough time &quot;to pass from polyurethane to textiles&quot;. The ambiguity continued when FINA was unable to define textile. The most specific aspect of the ruling returned men to bare chests and ladies to bare shoulders. The current rule (GR 5.4), as posted on FINA&#x27;s website, states &quot;Before any swimwear of new design, construction or material is used in competition, the manufacturer of such swimwear must submit the swimwear to FINA and obtain approval of FINA&quot;.

Speedo&#x27;s latest version of the LZR Racer series, the LZR Racer Elite, carries the FINA stamp of approval. The Elite series, like its predecessor utilises welded seams and compression material to sculpt the swimmer&#x27;s body. The SpeedoUSA website specifically denies the new generation of LZR Racers is a &quot;quick fix&quot;. The most recent list of FINA approved swimsuits, which was published in January 2011 lists 78 specific Speedo brand swimsuits among 45 worldwide brands and nearly 720 models. Among them, 71 are Fastskin models and 13 are LZR series suits. Several Speedo designs have been removed from the FINA list including the original LZR Racer, and multiple Fastskin models.

FINA&#x27;s ban on LZR Racers left Speedo with a significant surplus stock. The obsolete competition suits have found new life, though. London&#x27;s Chelsea College of Art and Design received a donation of 600 suits, 200 of which were turned into the Chelsea Xpo Pavilion as part of the 2010 London Festival of Architecture project. The pavilion can be seen on the college&#x27;s campus at the Rootstein Hopkins Parade Ground.

Another collaboration between Speedo and academia netted a line of designer fashions. Teams of students from the London College of Fashion, University College Falmouth and the University of Huddersfield have reused the material to create a complete fashion line including casual slacks, jackets, and even different forms of swimwear.

This was not the company&#x27;s first foray into recycled high fashion, though. In September 2010, sustainable fashion label, &quot;From Somewhere&quot; announced a new line of dresses made from Speedo&#x27;s surplus.

== Online resources ==
=== YouTube channel ===
Speedo started its YouTube channel dedicated to Speedo and its products specifically in the context of &quot;life in and around the water&quot; on 2 March 2007. One of the initial videos was aimed at journalists and providing them with a literal and virtual feel for what the athletes wearing the LZR Racer at the 2008 Summer Olympics felt by letting members of the media try the suits on in person in Beijing and sharing that experience virtually via YouTube. For swimmers, videos posted cover a wide range of topics including swimming technique overviews and breaking down the process of designing and making swimwear. Speedo&#x27;s channel also features high profile athletes at different points of their journey as a professional swimmer such as at the end of a World Championships.

== Sponsorships ==

<text>Walter Weedon Grossmith (9 June 1854 – 14 June 1919), better known as Weedon Grossmith, was an English writer, actor, painter and playwright best known as co-author of &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; (1892) with his brother, music hall comedian and Gilbert and Sullivan star George Grossmith. Weedon Grossmith also illustrated &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; to much acclaim.

Grossmith trained as a painter, but was unable to make a living in that capacity and went on the stage largely for financial reasons. He was successful as an actor and as an impresario, and wrote several plays. As an actor, he specialised in comedy roles, and his typical characters, harassed and scheming, became so identified with him that the &quot;Weedon Grossmith part&quot; became a regular feature of the theatre of his day.

==Life and career==

===Early years===

Grossmith was born in London and grew up in St. Pancras and Hampstead, London. His father, George Grossmith (1820–80), was the chief court reporter for &quot;The Times&quot; and other newspapers at the Bow Street police court and a lecturer and entertainer. His mother was Louisa Emmeline Grossmith &quot;née&quot; Weedon (d. 1882). His brother, George, became famous as the principal comedian of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company and was the most famous comedy-sketch pianist of the Victorian era.

Grossmith was educated at Massingham House on Haverstock Hill in Hampstead, and then at the North London Collegiate in Camden Town and Simpson&#x27;s School, a local private establishment. Interested in art, he trained as a painter at the West London School of Art, the Slade and the Royal Academy. His goal was to become a fashionable portrait painter. He had portraits and other pictures hung at the Academy (beginning with a full-length portrait of his father) and at the Grosvenor Gallery and elsewhere. However, his career as an artist was not as successful as he had hoped. Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte, having seen him act in amateur performances, encouraged him to take to the stage professionally. Having, as he later recalled, liabilities of £700 and cash assets of £6, he consulted his fellow-artists Frank Holl and Luke Fildes about abandoning art in favour of the theatre:

He [Fildes] thought it madness when I had conquered all the great difficulties of painting. I quite agreed with him, but when I told him of my dreadful run of bad luck, and the little I had, he said he was bound to admit that if I had another string to play on, it was worth considering. But he still thought it an awful pity, and so have I thought ever since.
===Acting career===

Grossmith turned to acting in 1885, which he pursued until 1917. Joining Rosina Vokes&#x27;s theatrical company in 1885, he went on tour in the provinces and in America. He first appeared in London at the Gaiety Theatre in 1887 as Woodcock in &quot;Woodcock&#x27;s Little Game&quot;. Neither he nor the play was a success. Grossmith contemplated giving up the stage and returning to painting. He was shunned by managers who had promised him work, but on the strength of his American successes he was engaged by Henry Irving in 1888 to play Jacques Strop at the Lyceum Theatre in Charles Selby&#x27;s &quot;Robert Macaire&quot;. He was nearly dismissed for interpreting Irving&#x27;s direction, &quot;You must imitate &quot;me&quot;&quot;, as an instruction to give an impersonation of the star&#x27;s well-known mannerisms. His earliest notable success was made in &quot;A Pantomime Rehearsal&quot;, a short play (parodying incompetent amateur theatricals) with which he was associated for many years. In 1888 Grossmith joined the company of Richard Mansfield in &quot;Wealth&quot;, playing the role of Percy Palfreyman. In the following year he began a long association with the Court Theatre; he appeared there in &quot;Aunt Jack&quot;, &quot;The Cabinet Minister&quot; and &quot;The Volcano&quot;. He also played in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; at the Globe Theatre (1889) and portrayed Joseph Lebanon in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Minister&quot; (1890).

In 1891, in partnership with Brandon Thomas, Grossmith presented and appeared in a triple bill, which included &quot;A Pantomime Rehearsal&quot;. After a shaky start, the production became a huge success; Grossmith appeared in it for more than 700 performances, in four different West End theatres, and he later calculated that Sebastian Smith as the leading man must have played the part about 1,000 times in London and on tour.
Grossmith went on to appear in plays by playwrights such as Henry Arthur Jones and Jerome K. Jerome, opposite actors such as Herbert Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre and with Mrs. John Wood at the Court Theatre. In 1892, he played in W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;, a parody of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, at the Royal Court Theatre. He became known for playing comedy character roles, noting, &quot;I am almost invariably cast for cowards, cads and snobs&quot;, and he was particularly good at portraying harassed, misunderstood little men as, like his brother George, he was small in stature. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;Weedon Grossmith&quot; part had become a recognised feature of current drama.

He portrayed Archibald Rennick in Arthur Law&#x27;s &quot;The New Boy&quot; (1894), Hamilton Preedy in &quot;Mr. Preedy and the Countess&quot; (1905), Jimmy Jinks in &quot;Baby Mine&quot; (1911), the Earl of Tweenwayes in &quot;The Amazons&quot;, Boney in &quot;The Misleading Lady&quot;, and the Judge in &quot;Stopping the Breach&quot;, his last new role (1917). The critic B. W. Findon wrote, &quot;Among the survivors of the old brigade – of the artists who thoroughly understand the requirements of farcical comedy, who know how to treat its humour with breadth, and grapple successfully with its ludicrous situations – is Mr. Weedon Grossmith. He is one of the best – I think I may say the best actor of farce on the stage of to-day.&quot;

Grossmith&#x27;s last stage appearance was in 1918, in his old role of Lord Arthur Pomeroy in &quot;A Pantomime Rehearsal&quot;, with an all-star cast including Charles Hawtrey, Fay Compton, Irene Castle and Rutland Barrington, at a charity matinée attended by King George V, Queen Mary and Queen Alexandra.

Grossmith was also the lessee of London&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre from 1894 to 1896 and Terry&#x27;s Theatre until 1917.

===Author and playwright===

In 1892, Grossmith collaborated with his brother George to expand a series of amusing columns they had written in 1888–89 for &quot;Punch&quot;. &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; was published as a novel and has never been out of print since. The book is a sharp analysis of social insecurity, and Charles Pooter of The Laurels, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, was immediately recognized as one of the great English comic characters. Grossmith created 33 black and white line drawings for the novel. According to biographer Tony Joseph, &quot;In their precise and careful detail these illustrations ... reinforce the text to perfection.&quot; The work has itself been the object of dramatization and adaptation, including three times for television: 1964, 1979 and 2007.

Grossmith published another novel, &quot;A Woman with a History&quot;, in 1896. He also wrote a number of plays, the most successful of which was &quot;The Night of the Party&quot; (1901), for which he also directed, acted the lead role, designed the scenery and painted the advertising poster. One of his plays, &quot;The Duffer&quot;, was about students at the Royal Academy, which was successful and enjoyed a Royal Command Performance. In 1913 he published his autobiography, &quot;From Studio to Stage&quot;.

===Personal life===
Grossmith was a member of the Beefsteak, Garrick and Savage clubs. In 1895, he married the actress May Lever Palfrey (1867–1929). They had one child, a daughter, Nancy (1896–1921). He died in London at the age of 65. A memorial service, attended by leading members of the theatrical profession, was held in St Martin-in-the-Fields.

<doc id="241855" wikidata="Q194424" url="?curid=241855" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (book)">
<text>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (often referred to as simply Fantastic Beasts) is a 2001 guide book written by British author J. K. Rowling (under the pen name of the fictitious author Newt Scamander) about the magical creatures in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. The original version, illustrated by the author herself, purports to be Harry Potter&#x27;s copy of the textbook of the same name mentioned in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (or &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; in the US), the first novel of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. It includes several notes inside it supposedly handwritten by Harry, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, detailing their own experiences with some of the beasts described, and including inside jokes relating to the original series.

In a 2001 interview with publisher Scholastic, Rowling stated that she chose the subject of magical creatures because it was a fun topic for which she had already developed much information in earlier books. Rowling&#x27;s name did not appear on the cover of the first edition, the work being credited under the pen name &quot;Newt Scamander&quot;, who, in the books, wrote this textbook as seen on Harry&#x27;s supply list for his first year.

The book benefits the BBC affiliated charity Comic Relief. Over 80% of the cover price of each book sold goes directly to poor children in various places around the world. According to Comic Relief, sales from this book and its companion &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; had raised over £17 million by July 2009.

On 12 September 2013, Warner Bros. and Rowling announced they would be producing a film inspired by the book, being the first in a series of five such films. Rowling herself was the screenwriter. She came up with a plan for a movie after Warner Bros. suggested the idea. The story features Newt Scamander as a main character and is set in New York City, 70 years before Harry&#x27;s story started. The film was released on 18 November 2016.

On 14 March 2017 a new edition of the book, with cover illustrations by Jonny Duddle and interior illustrations by Tomislav Tomic, was published with six new creatures and a foreword by Newt Scamander. It is assumed to be a new copy as it does not feature any handwritten notes. Proceeds from this edition are donated to Lumos as well as Comic Relief.

On 7 November 2017 a new edition was published with illustrations by , featuring the aforementioned 2017 text. On 1 February 2018 a Kindle in Motion edition, featuring these illustrations with movement, was released for compatible devices.

==Synopsis==
===Original &quot;for Muggles&quot; version===
&quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; purports to be a reproduction of a textbook owned by Harry Potter and written by magizoologist Newt Scamander, a character in the fictional &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. In the series, magizoology is the study of magical creatures.

Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts, provides the foreword and explains the purpose of the special edition of this book (the Comic Relief charity). At the end, he assures muggle readers, &quot;The amusing creatures described hereafter are fictional and cannot hurt you.&quot; He repeats the Hogwarts motto: &quot;Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus&quot;, Latin for &quot;Never tickle a sleeping dragon&quot;.

&quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; contains the history of magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the world. Scamander says that he collected most of the information found in the book through observations made over years of travel across five continents. He notes that the first edition was commissioned in 1918 by Augustus Worme of Obscurus Books. However, it was not published until 1927. It is now in its fifty-second edition.

In the Harry Potter universe, the book is a required textbook for first-year Hogwarts students, having been an approved textbook since its first publication. In his foreword to the book, Albus Dumbledore notes that it serves as an excellent reference for wizarding households in addition to its use at Hogwarts.

The book features doodles and comments added by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, who apparently shares the book with Harry &quot;because his fell apart&quot;. The comments would appear to have been written around the time of the fourth book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;. These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the &quot;Acromantula&quot; entry has a comment confirming that Hogwarts is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Harry stating &quot;you&#x27;re not kidding&quot; when talking about the Hungarian Horntail being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry&#x27;s encounter with one in the fourth book).

The cover design of the first edition of the book features apparent claw marks from an unidentified animal.

===2017 &quot;for Wizards&quot; version===
This edition features six new creatures: the hidebehind, the hodag, the horned serpent, the snallygaster, the thunderbird, and the wampus cat, in addition to the original 75, and the illustrations are replaced. Newt Scamander, in the foreword, explains the reason the six new creatures were not previously included is because MACUSA president Seraphina Picquery requested the more important American creatures not be mentioned to deter wizarding sightseers at a time when the US wizarding community were subject to greater persecution than their European counterparts, and after Scamander had contributed to a serious breach of the International Statute of Secrecy in New York.

===Role in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series===
The book&#x27;s fictional author, Newt Scamander, does not appear in the main &quot;Harry Potter&quot; book series.

However, his name is seen on the Marauder&#x27;s Map in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; film. He is the central character of the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; film series, in which he is played by Eddie Redmayne.

<doc id="241856" wikidata="Q282838" url="?curid=241856" title="1963 (comics)">
<text>1963 is an American six-issue comic book limited series written by Alan Moore in 1993, with art by his frequent collaborators Steve Bissette, John Totleben, and Rick Veitch. Dave Gibbons, Don Simpson, and Jim Valentino also contributed art. Image Comics published the series.

The six issues are an homage to the Silver Age of American comics (in particular, the early Marvel Comics), and feature spoof text pieces and advertisements.

==Creation==
Ashcans for the characters were created in 1992 before the series was announced in Spring 1993, and marked Alan Moore&#x27;s return to superhero comics after announcing his retirement from the genre in 1989, with &quot;1963&quot; as a banner title for six one-shots – &quot;Mystery Incorporated&quot;, &quot;The Fury&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Uncanny&quot;, &quot;Tales from Beyond&quot;, &quot;Horus – Lord of Light&quot; and &quot;The Tomorrow Syndicate&quot;, to be followed by an 80-page &quot;1963 Annual&quot; drawn by Jim Lee. His initial intention was to create old-fashioned Silver Age-style heroes to contrast with the grimmer characters that made up Image Comics&#x27; output at that point, with a direct crossover in the concluding annual. His train of thought was that in a Silver Age morality, the likes of Spawn and Shadowhawk would have been considered villains for their violent methods, but also felt it would show evolving gender roles in the medium. While Moore had long fallen out with both Marvel and their rival DC, he remained fond of their Silver Age output. The series was assigned to Jim Valentino&#x27;s Shadowline imprint.

Moore worked with several artists he had previously collaborated with on the series – notably having worked alongside Bissette, Veitch and Totleben on his acclaimed &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; run. All involved worked for low page rates, hoping to profit from long-term royalties for the creator-owned work. In addition to the comic stories being pastiches of the Silver Age material of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the issues featured additional pages parodying the material found in Marvel comics of the period. Each creator was given bombastic, alliterative nicknames – &#x27;Affable&#x27; Al, &#x27;Sturdy&#x27; Steve, &#x27;Roarin&#x27; Rick and &#x27;Jaunty John&#x27; – while the &quot;Sixty-Three Sweatshop&quot; column mirrored the style and content of Lee&#x27;s &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot;/&quot;Stan&#x27;s Soapbox&quot; columns, with the letters pages also containing fake missives in the style of those from the period, complete with replies from &#x27;Al&#x27;. Also included were mock contemporary advertisements, satirising many of the services displayed in comics of the time such as Charles Atlas&#x27; fitness programmes. The parody was not entirely affectionate; &#x27;Affable&#x27; Al was implied to be an amoral self-promoter and credit-hog, referencing Lee and Marvel&#x27;s legal disputes with Kirby and Steve Ditko while vociferously defending his work for hire policy. Al also advertised his book &quot;How I Created Everything All By Myself and Why I Am Great&quot; – a reference to Lee&#x27;s own &quot;Origins of Marvel Comics&quot;, which has been criticised for overplaying the writer&#x27;s part in the fertile Marvel Silver Age at the expense of his collaborators. The series even went as far as to use newsprint stock to replicate the feel of 1960s comics, rather than the high-quality gloss stock used by other Image titles, while the creators also gave in-character interviews to Tom Fields for an issue of British magazine &quot;Comic Talk&quot;.

==Publishing history==
The six one-shots appeared as scheduled and sold well; the first issue was Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27; 15th best-selling title of June 1993, with the second 29th the following month, the third 68th in June, the fourth 71st in July, the fifth 85th in August and the sixth 87th for September. Bissette recollected the issues sold between 300,000 and 500,000 copies each, earning Bissette and the other contributors a significant amount of money.

However, the annual – slated to feature the &quot;1963&quot; characters crossing over with the Image Universe characters WildC.A.T.s, Spawn, Shadowhawk, Youngblood, Savage Dragon and Supreme – failed to appear. Moore was halfway through writing it when Jim Lee announced he was taking a year-long sabbatical from drawing comics to focus on his growing business role within Image. Letterer Don Simpson would later accuse Lee of never planning to work on the annual as part of a plan to sabotage the series. Bissette would later state he felt Valentino had brought Alan Moore to Image in the hope that &quot;1963&quot; would function as a gateway for the acclaimed writer working on other Shadowline characters, something which saw the series&#x27; creative team caught in a political crossfire as the relationship between the founding Image partners began to fray. Moore himself was rapidly tapped to work on other Image titles including &quot;Spawn&quot;, &quot;Violator&quot; and &quot;WildC.A.T.s&quot;.

===Appearances in other comics===
The Tomorrow Syndicate are among the characters to be featured outside of the original limited series in &quot;Big Bang Comics&quot; #35 (January 2001), while the Fury appeared in &quot;Shadowhawk&quot; #14 (October 1994) and &quot;Noble Causes: Family Secrets&quot; #3 (December 2002).

==Completion attempts==
Fellow Image Rob Liefeld was planned to work on the annual, but left the company in acrimonious circumstances in 1996 to found Awesome Comics – meaning none of his characters could be used for &quot;1963&quot;; Shaft of &quot;Youngblood&quot; had featured in the cliffhanger ending to No. 6. Further problems came when Moore fell out with Bissette in 1996 after the writer took offence at comments Bissette had made in an interview in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #185 (cover dated March 1996). In a 2010 interview with Comic Book Resources, Bissette claimed to still be unaware at what exactly had caused the rift, having only found out Moore had taken umbrage through mutual acquaintance Neil Gaiman; an attempt to find out from Moore himself via phone was met with the curt reply &quot;Right, Steve? I&#x27;ll keep this short. Don&#x27;t call me, don&#x27;t write me, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it&#x27;s over, mate.&quot; – at which point Moore hung up.

Bissette, Moore and Veitch began communicating in 1998 to divide ownership of the various characters created for &quot;1963&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Wizard Magazine&quot; included the series in a sidebar of an article on the greatest comic stories never told, noting that it was unlikely to ever be finished. Over the following years Bissette and Veitch worked to create a collected edition of the material, with Moore deigning to contact the pair by email for some time. Asked about the series in 2007, Erik Larsen – one of the founders remaining at Image Comics – stated he felt the &quot;ship may have sailed&quot; for completing the work. Nevertheless, some work continued when the trio could find time. After rejecting what the trio considered a derisive buy-out offer from DC Comics, they came close to a deal with Dynamite Entertainment in January 2009. However, after this collapsed in 2010, Bissette used his blog to announce negotiations had fallen through, and that even a collected edition of the already-published material was unlikely during his lifetime.

In 2022, Simpson announced plans to create his own version of the &quot;1963 Annual&quot; as a solo work. Fueled by a dispute over a reprint of an unrelated Moore-scripted story which the writer refused to allow his name to be used for, Simpson&#x27;s cover for the annual featured the strap line &#x27;Fuck &quot;Al&quot;&#x27;, complete with a caricature of an irate Moore in the corner box. Posting in-progress pages on his Facebook account, Simpson also included comments that indicated he believed Moore&#x27;s intransigence and ego were as much responsible for &quot;1963&quot;&#x27;s collapse as the oft-blamed Image partners.

==Plot==
===Book One: &quot;Mystery Incorporated&quot;===
Mystery Incorporated test the Mystery Mile&#x27;s new defence system. Despite their seeming success a hooded stranger arrives inside via the Maybe Machine, and soon afterwards the highly advanced defence system turns on the team. The masked invader captures Kid Dynamo, while Crystal Man deduces the stranger is from a parallel universe. The remaining trio enter the Maybe Machine to recover their team-mate.

===Book Two: &quot;No One Escapes... the Fury&quot;===
The Fury is engaged by Commander Sky Solo of L.A.S.E.R. to escort the secret Cargo X to their headquarters under the United Nations Building. The convoy is attacked by jet-vested Raiders; chasing them down the Fury is also attacked by enemy Voidoid. Cargo X meanwhile turns out to be a cryogenically frozen three-eyed talking dinosaur with opposable thumbs, which escapes and interrupts the fight between the Fury and the Voidoid. The Fury is saved by Solo&#x27;s intervention and ducks out of the battle to phone his mother, who believes he is at school. He defeats the monster and is able to get back without blowing his secret.

===Book Three: &quot;Tales of the Uncanny&quot;===
====&quot;U.S.A. – Ultimate Special Agent&quot;====
U.S.A. uses his abilities to take the place of President Jack Kennedy in Dallas following a tip-off, drawing out the assassin. However, the would-be assassin vanishes, and U.S.A. finds a brainwashed doppelganger tied up in a book depository. The latter is Leo Harley Osbourne, who was under police observation; the double however seems to have disabled other would-be assassins stationed at the Grassy Knoll. U.S.A. investigates and discovers Osbourne is a member of the Communist Party, recently returned from a trip to Russia. He realises the plot is linked to villain Red Brain, and foils the latter&#x27;s plan to assassinate Osbourne. However, Red Brain turns the nearby police into brainwashed Communist zombies. U.S.A. is nearly defeated until he is saved by the Osbourne double, who only gives oblique explanations for his actions before disappearing.

====&quot;The Hypernaut&quot;====
The Hypernaut and his twin-headed monkey Queep are relaxing on the Hyperbase behind the Moon when they come under attack from a being from the fourth dimension. Due to the creature&#x27;s ability to occupy an extra dimension the battle is difficult, and the Hypernaut is seemingly destroyed. However, he preserves his intelligence in his cerebro-sphere and is able to slip between the invader&#x27;s atoms, disrupting the four-dimensional being and sending it fleeing back to its home dimension. Hypernaut is then able to transfer to a spare body.

===Book Four: &quot;Tales from Beyond&quot;===
====&quot;The Unbelievable N-Man&quot;====
The N-Man investigates a high-radiation zone in the Yucca Flats. An atomic bomb test has created a pocket of mutant animals and plants. He is attacked by mutated Soviet scientist Grigor Kokarovitch, who traps him in a lake of setting molten glass. N-Man breaks free and Kokarovitch is sucked into a collapsing Neutron Bead at the centre of the zone, while N-Man escapes to safety.

====&quot;Johnny Beyond&quot;====
Johnny Beyond encounters a lost woman searching for a bar called The Laundry who speaks strangely and has a telephone in her purse and keeps mentioning feminism. He offers to walk her home but she takes him to his own apartment block. Once inside he is further confused by the plastic cases on her books and coasters in cigarette cases before finding out she is married to an older version of himself called John Behan. In confusion and the woman go outside, only for the house to fold it on itself. She runs back up to find her room inhabited by saxophonist &#x27;Lips&#x27; Lincoln. Beyond contacts his mentor Garab Dorje via Necrosphere, who warns them the building is twisted in time. He tries to return everyone to their correct times but he himself is sucked through before he finishes the job.

===Book Five: &quot;Horus, Lord of Light&quot;===
Horus saves New York from the rampaging Termagant and returns to his civilian guise of academic Professor Falcon. However, after lectures finish he changes back and is spotted by student Janet, who secretes herself in a sarcophagus on his Barge from Beyond as he sets off to pay homage to Ra. Set attempts to provoke Horus before their bickering is interrupted by Isis. Set however drugs the crew of Ra&#x27;s barge, leaving the Sun God dormant. Horus boards Ra&#x27;s barge and guides it through attempted attacks by Nehebkau and Astarte, despite the unexpected presence of Janet. She is captured by Anubis but Horus rescues her despite briefly awakening Herakhty. They guide the barge home regardless, but Janet is put on trial for blasphemy. She is spared when Osiris himself objects from beyond the grave. Horus returns a sleeping Janet to Midtown College and turns back into Falcon, convincing her the adventure was a dream.

===Book Six: &quot;The Tomorrow Syndicate&quot;===
Inframan and Infragirl summon Horus, U.S.A., N-Man, and Hypernaut to the Tomorrow Complex to investigate Voidoid&#x27;s alien weapons, recovered by the Fury. The team track two sources of similar radiation on Earth, in New York. They travel there in the Tomorrobile, which Infra-Man shrinks so they can go underground to the radiation source, emerging in the Mystery Mile, with the Fury following. They decide to head to the Maybe Machine and see numerous parallel versions of themselves and head to a huge floating complex along with their variants, finding themselves in the Lobby of Alternity. They manage to find out where Mystery Incorporated were heading and set off again in the Tomorrobile and follow them to an alternate Earth, finding evil versions of themselves. The Tomorrow Syndicate are able to escape after defeating their doubles and continue the search before tracking Mystery Incorporated to a &quot;harsh, vivid&quot; world. The hooded stranger meanwhile emerges with the captured Kid Dynamo, revealing himself to be Shaft.

==Characters==
===The Fury===
Son of World War II hero the Ragin&#x27; Fury, Richard &#x27;Rick&#x27; Judge takes up the role of the Fury at the behest of his dying father and against the wishes of his mother, who believes he is undertaking a normal school education. The Fury has no powers, instead relying on a pair of wrist-launched discuses. Among his rogues are the Voidoid (whose secret identity is someone who knows Rick in everyday life) and the rest of the Threatening Three (Pyroman and the Dune). He has considerable doubts over choosing to be a hero rather than staying in school and while he claims to have never killed anyone he is distinctly careless in combat, putting numerous foes in potentially lethal situations.

The character is modelled on Spider-Man.

===Johnny Beyond===
John Behan is capable of projecting an ectoplasm version of himself called a Tulpa, one of many skills he learnt from Garab Dorje on his path to becoming a Ngagpa. Despite being an inhabitant of 1963 he speaks entirely in 1950s beatnik slang.

The character is based on Doctor Strange.

===Mystery Incorporated===
When an asteroid comes close to Earth, the government sent up physicist Craig Crandall, astronaut Biff Baker and students Tommy Baker and Jeannie Morrow to investigate via rocket. They discover alien statues which transform them into superpowered beings. They form a crimefighting team called Mystery Incorporated and establish an underground base called the Mystery Mile, fighting villains such as Amazonia, Doc Apocalypse and King Zero, becoming popular celebrities for their heroism.

The characters are modelled on the Fantastic Four.
*Crystal Man: Craig Crandall is the de facto leader and brainbox of the team, capable of changing his crystalline body to any shape – which also gives him the ability to link with computers, and allowing him to reform if shattered. He can also assume a human-looking form. Despite their visible age difference he is attracted to team-mate Neon Queen.
*The Planet: Biff Baker is the team&#x27;s heavy and pilot, given superhuman strength. Despite being an astronaut he is scientifically ignorant, and given to exclaiming &quot;Goldarn it&quot; as an expletive. He can voluntarily change his face to resemble a moon, though it is unclear what effect this has on him or anything else. While he seems to have feelings for villainess Amazonia and openly berates his brother for not knowing what a &#x27;real woman&#x27; is, he is also attracted to Neon Queen.
*Kid Dynamo: Tommy Baker, Biff&#x27;s whiz-kid younger brother who can turn into pure electricity. Despite being in a relationship with the popular Neon Queen, Kid Dynamo is hot-headed, sexist and generally obnoxious.
*Neon Queen: Jeannie Morrow can turn her body into gas. She is unpopular with the public, receiving &quot;fan mail&quot; saying she should resign from the group, something she genuinely considers as her femininity may make her the weak link in the team. She cleans the Mystery Mile and is largely defined by being the romantic interest for the other three-quarters of the team. Her in-universe unpopularity is mirrored in criticism in the issue&#x27;s letters page

===The Tomorrow Syndicate===
A team of superheroes who meet in the Tomorrow Complex, a base inside Mount Rushmore.

The team are based on The Avengers.
*Horus: after Osiris&#x27; betrayal by his brother set, their sister Isis gathered the fourteen parts he had been split into and used them to bear a son, Horus. Horus divides his time between foiling Set&#x27;s various plans in the land of the Gods and adventuring on Earth. While on the latter he poses as college mythology lecturer Professor Falcon, and attracts the attention of student Janet. He can switch between forms by holding his solar staff and reciting an incantation.
**The character and his mythos are inspired by Marvel&#x27;s use of Norse mythology for &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;/&quot;The Mighty Thor&quot;, instead substituting Ancient Egyptian deities.
*The Hypernaut: after an experimental jet he was piloting suffers engine failure, pilot Dave Stevens is snatched to safety by a flying saucer, where unseen aliens transferred his brain to a cybernetic body as one of the Hypernauts, a universe-wide group of those saved from their point of death. He inhabits the Penrose triangle-shaped Hyperbase behind Earth&#x27;s moon, where he constantly narrates his actions to fused pink monkey Queep.
**The character seems based on the Silver Age Green Lantern, Hal Jordan and Iron Man.
*Infragirl: partner of Inframan, who uses the same powers. Infragirl does little other than swoon over the attractiveness of her various team-mates.
**The character is based on the Wasp.
*Inframan: a scientist hero who uses a size regulator to change the size of himself and others.
**The character is based on Ant-Man.
*N-Man: Doctor Will Chambers experimented on himself to make a human form resistant to radiation, making himself indestructible and irritable. He carries out missions for Colonel Powers and is deeply patriotic, hating Communists as well as Mystery Incorporated and the Hypernaut.
**The character is based on the Hulk.
*U.S.A.: Ultimate Secret Agent works for the American government. During World War II he was exposed to Vitamin Omega, which combined with his rare blood type to give him super-strength and agility. While World War II is over he remains an active hero due to his slowed aging, working for L.A.S.E.R. he fervently hates Communists, and is lusted after by the First Lady.
**The character is modelled on Captain America. During World War II he fought in the Victory Vanguard.

==Ownership==
According to Bissette, during negotiations he was the owner of N-Man, the Fury, the Hypernaut and Commander Solo &amp; Her Screamin&#x27; Skydogs. He used them as the core of his own &#x27;Naut Universe&#x27;.

==Reception==
Reception to &quot;1963&quot; has been mixed, though the series was nominated for Best Continuing/Limited Series at the 1994 Harvey Awards, losing out to &quot;Marvels&quot;. Covering the series as part of his review of Moore&#x27;s career output for Tor.com, Tim Callahan was unimpressed by &quot;1963&quot;, feeling it was one of the writer&#x27;s weakest projects, feeling the nature of the pastiche was overplayed, especially as there was no payoff due to the lack of a conclusion, noting &quot;even with different names and characters and specific Marvel-homage gags, they are just too much.&quot; Cody White of Comic Watch had similar feelings, though he felt that Image being able to hire Moore in the first place was a major landmark in the publisher&#x27;s history. In an essay printed in &quot;Alan Moore – Portrait of an Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, Darko Macan felt the story was stupid without being &quot;stupid enough&quot;. Rohith C of Medium was more positive about the first issue, praising the affectionate parody of Lee/Kirby-era &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

<text>John Byrom, John Byrom of Kersal, or John Byrom of Manchester (29 February 1692 – 26 September 1763) was an English poet, the inventor of a revolutionary system of shorthand and later a significant landowner. He is most remembered as the writer of the lyrics of Anglican hymn &quot;Christians, awake, salute the happy morn&quot;, which was supposedly a Christmas gift for his daughter.

== Early life ==
Byrom was descended from an old genteel Lancashire family. Ralph Byrom came to Manchester from Lowton in 1485 and became a prosperous wool merchant. His son Adam acquired property in Salford, Darcy Lever, Bolton and Ardwick (though his wealth did not prevent his mentally ill daughter from being accused of witchcraft). Edward Byrom helped to foil a Royalist plot to seize Manchester in 1642.

Byrom was born at what is now The Old Wellington Inn (part of the Old Shambles), Manchester, in 1692. The property was then used as an office for market tolls, with accommodation on the upper floors. The inn, now a tourist attraction, has a plaque in the bar area which commemorates his birth. However, some sources claim that he was born at Kersal Cell in Lower Kersal in the township of Broughton, near Salford, just outside Manchester.
According to Bailey he was one of the tallest men in the kingdom.

His privileged background enabled him to obtain an excellent education, including The King&#x27;s School, Chester, and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow there in 1714. He subsequently travelled abroad and studied medicine at Montpellier in France.

== Byrom and shorthand ==

Byrom invented a system of shorthand and, having perfected this, returned to England in 1716. Some of the inhabitants of Manchester tried to persuade him to set up a medical practice in the town, but he decided that his abilities were insufficient to pursue a medical career and resolved to teach his shorthand system instead. Shortly after coming into his family inheritance in 1740, he patented his &quot;New Universal Shorthand&quot;. This system of shorthand, officially taught at both Oxford and Cambridge universities, was used by the clerk of the House of Lords.


On 16 June 1742, An Act of Parliament (15 Geo. 2. c. 23) secured to John Byrom, M.A., the sole right of publishing for a certain term of years (21) the art and method of shorthand invented by him.

His system of shorthand was posthumously published as &quot;The Universal English Shorthand&quot; which, although superseded in the nineteenth century, marked a significant development in the history of shorthand. It was used by John (1703–1791) and Charles Wesley (1707–1788), founders of Methodism, who recorded their self-examinations in coded diaries.

== Family life ==
The ancestral home of the Byrom family is Byrom Hall at Slag Lane in Lowton (the lane facing the hall is called Byrom Lane).

He lived here from time to time, but seems to have largely resided in a town house in Manchester and at Kersal Cell.

Byrom had three daughters and a son. His eldest child was the diarist and Jacobite supporter Elizabeth &quot;Beppy&quot; and his son was named Edward. His favourite was his daughter Dorothy, known as Dolly. In December 1745, after a romp with Dolly, he promised to write her something for Christmas; it was to be written especially for her and no one else. The delighted Dolly reminded her father of his promise each day as Christmas grew nearer. On Christmas morning, when she ran down to breakfast, she found several presents awaiting her. Among them was an envelope addressed to her in her father&#x27;s handwriting. It was the first thing she opened and, to her great delight, it proved to be a Christmas carol entitled &quot;Christians, awake, salute the happy morn&quot;. The original manuscript, headed with &quot;Christmas Day for Dolly&quot;, was first published in Harrop&#x27;s &quot;Manchester Mercury&quot; in 1746.

== Literary remains ==
Although Byrom is probably best remembered for this Christmas carol, he was regarded by his contemporaries as a poet and a literary man. Most of his poems, the best-known of which is &quot;My spirit longeth for Thee&quot;, were religious in tone. Byrom greatly admired William Law and he often versified parts of Law&#x27;s prose. The printer and novelist Samuel Richardson printed poems for Byrom, some of which were found upon Richardson&#x27;s death among his manuscripts. Byrom is also remembered for his epigrams and, above all, his coinage of the phrase &quot;Tweedledum and Tweedledee&quot; (in connection with a dispute about the merits of the two composers, George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini).

Ralph Tomlinson authored a parody of John Byrom&#x27;s poem called &quot;A Slang Pastoral&quot;. It begins &quot;My Time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,&quot; and it was originally published in &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

== A man of mystery ==
Byrom did not lead an ordinary provincial life. He was a member of the Royal Society while Sir Isaac Newton was president, moving in some very influential social and intellectual circles in London and elsewhere. Modern research has revealed him to be something of a man of mystery. In the first place there is the question of his political views. It was once thought that he was a closet Jacobite, but it is now suggested that he may have acted as a double agent, the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Chameleon&quot;. His views might be summed up in the verse that he composed, in the form of a toast:

:God bless the King! (I mean our faith&#x27;s defender!)
:God bless! (No harm in blessing) the Pretender.
:But who Pretender is, and who is King,
:God bless us all! That&#x27;s quite another thing!

Byrom died in 1763 and is buried in his family&#x27;s private chapel, which is now known as Jesus Chapel in Manchester Cathedral, Manchester, England. His papers, though preserved for some time after his death, were mysteriously destroyed in the nineteenth century. A freemason, few surviving items have suggested that he may have belonged to an early quasi-masonic society, known as the &quot;Cabala Club&quot;, similar to the Gentleman&#x27;s Club of Spalding, and pursued occult interests.

He was survived by his wife who died in December 1778. All of his estate and the family home of Kersall Cell, Salford was left to Elizabeth Byrom.

His library of books and manuscripts were donated to Chetham&#x27;s Library by his descendant Eleanora Atherton in 1870.

Byrom&#x27;s papers were accumulated by the John Rylands Research Institute and Library throughout the 20th century and referred to as the Thomson-Byrom following donations by Rev. W. H. Thomson of Manchester in 1961 and 1963, and the third by his niece, Miss V. Keable, in 1971.

<doc id="241863" wikidata="Q1224446" url="?curid=241863" title="Difference quotient">
<text>In single-variable calculus, the difference quotient is usually the name for the expression

:formula_1

which when taken to the limit as &quot;h&quot; approaches 0 gives the derivative of the function &quot;f&quot;. The name of the expression stems from the fact that it is the quotient of the difference of values of the function by the difference of the corresponding values of its argument (the latter is (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;h&quot;) - &quot;x&quot; = &quot;h&quot; in this case). The difference quotient is a measure of the average rate of change of the function over an interval (in this case, an interval of length &quot;h&quot;). The limit of the difference quotient (i.e., the derivative) is thus the instantaneous rate of change.

By a slight change in notation (and viewpoint), for an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], the difference quotient

:formula_2

is called the mean (or average) value of the derivative of &quot;f&quot; over the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]. This name is justified by the mean value theorem, which states that for a differentiable function &quot;f&quot;, its derivative &quot;&quot; reaches its mean value at some point in the interval. Geometrically, this difference quotient measures the slope of the secant line passing through the points with coordinates (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;)) and (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;b&quot;)).

Difference quotients are used as approximations in numerical differentiation, but they have also been subject of criticism in this application.

Difference quotients may also find relevance in applications involving Time discretization, where the width of the time step is used for the value of h.

The difference quotient is sometimes also called the Newton quotient (after Isaac Newton) or Fermat&#x27;s difference quotient (after Pierre de Fermat).

==Overview==
The typical notion of the difference quotient discussed above is a particular case of a more general concept. The primary vehicle of calculus and other higher mathematics is the function. Its &quot;input value&quot; is its &quot;argument&quot;, usually a point (&quot;P&quot;) expressible on a graph. The difference between two points, themselves, is known as their Delta (Δ&quot;P&quot;), as is the difference in their function result, the particular notation being determined by the direction of formation:
*Forward difference: Δ&quot;F&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;P&quot; + Δ&quot;P&quot;) − &quot;F&quot;(&quot;P&quot;);
*Central difference: δF(P) = F(P + ΔP) − F(P − ΔP);
*Backward difference: ∇F(P) = F(P) − F(P − ΔP).
The general preference is the forward orientation, as F(P) is the base, to which differences (i.e., &quot;ΔP&quot;s) are added to it. Furthermore,

*If |ΔP| is &quot;finite&quot; (meaning measurable), then ΔF(P) is known as a finite difference, with specific denotations of DP and DF(P);
*If |ΔP| is &quot;infinitesimal&quot; (an infinitely small amount—&quot;formula_3&quot;—usually expressed in standard analysis as a limit: formula_4), then ΔF(P) is known as an infinitesimal difference, with specific denotations of dP and dF(P) (in calculus graphing, the point is almost exclusively identified as &quot;x&quot; and F(x) as &quot;y&quot;).

The function difference divided by the point difference is known as &quot;difference quotient&quot;:

:formula_5

If ΔP is infinitesimal, then the difference quotient is a &quot;derivative&quot;, otherwise it is a &quot;divided difference&quot;:

:formula_6

:formula_7

==Defining the point range==
Regardless if ΔP is infinitesimal or finite, there is (at least—in the case of the derivative—theoretically) a point range, where the boundaries are P ± (0.5) ΔP (depending on the orientation—ΔF(P), δF(P) or ∇F(P)):
:LB = Lower Boundary; UB = Upper Boundary;
Derivatives can be regarded as functions themselves, harboring their own derivatives. Thus each function is home to sequential degrees (&quot;higher orders&quot;) of derivation, or &quot;differentiation&quot;. This property can be generalized to all difference quotients.&lt;br&gt;
As this sequencing requires a corresponding boundary splintering, it is practical to break up the point range into smaller, equi-sized sections, with each section being marked by an intermediary point (&quot;P&quot;&quot;i&quot;), where LB = &quot;P&quot;0 and UB = &quot;P&quot;&quot;ń&quot;, the &quot;n&quot;th point, equaling the degree/order:

 LB = P0 = P0 + 0Δ1P = Pń − (Ń-0)Δ1P;
 P1 = P0 + 1Δ1P = Pń − (Ń-1)Δ1P;
 P2 = P0 + 2Δ1P = Pń − (Ń-2)Δ1P;
 P3 = P0 + 3Δ1P = Pń − (Ń-3)Δ1P;
 Pń-3 = P0 + (Ń-3)Δ1P = Pń − 3Δ1P;
 Pń-2 = P0 + (Ń-2)Δ1P = Pń − 2Δ1P;
 Pń-1 = P0 + (Ń-1)Δ1P = Pń − 1Δ1P;
 UB = Pń-0 = P0 + (Ń-0)Δ1P = Pń − 0Δ1P = Pń;

 ΔP = Δ1P = P1 − P0 = P2 − P1 = P3 − P2 = ... = Pń − Pń-1;

 ΔB = UB − LB = Pń − P0 = ΔńP = ŃΔ1P.

==The primary difference quotient (&quot;Ń&quot; = 1)==
:formula_8

===As a derivative===
:The difference quotient as a derivative needs no explanation, other than to point out that, since P0 essentially equals P1 = P2 = ... = Pń (as the differences are infinitesimal), the Leibniz notation and derivative expressions do not distinguish P to P0 or Pń:

:::formula_9
There are other derivative notations, but these are the most recognized, standard designations.

===As a divided difference===
:A divided difference, however, does require further elucidation, as it equals the average derivative between and including LB and UB:

:: formula_10

:In this interpretation, Pã represents a function extracted, average value of P (midrange, but usually not exactly midpoint), the particular valuation depending on the function averaging it is extracted from. More formally, Pã is found in the mean value theorem of calculus, which says:

::&quot;For any function that is continuous on [LB,UB] and differentiable on (LB,UB) there exists some Pã in the interval (LB,UB) such that the secant joining the endpoints of the interval [LB,UB] is parallel to the tangent at Pã.&quot;

:Essentially, Pã denotes some value of P between LB and UB—hence,

::formula_11

:which links the mean value result with the divided difference:

:: formula_12

:As there is, by its very definition, a tangible difference between LB/P0 and UB/Pń, the Leibniz and derivative expressions &quot;do&quot; require divarication of the function argument.

==Applying the divided difference==
The quintessential application of the divided difference is in the presentation of the definite integral, which is nothing more than a finite difference:

: formula_23

Given that the mean value, derivative expression form provides all of the same information as the classical integral notation, the mean value form may be the preferable expression, such as in writing venues that only support/accept standard ASCII text, or in cases that only require the average derivative (such as when finding the average radius in an elliptic integral).
This is especially true for definite integrals that technically have (e.g.) 0 and either formula_24 or formula_25 as boundaries, with the same divided difference found as that with boundaries of 0 and formula_26 (thus requiring less averaging effort):

: formula_27

This also becomes particularly useful when dealing with &quot;iterated&quot; and &quot;multiple integral&quot;s (ΔA = AU − AL, ΔB = BU − BL, ΔC = CU − CL):

: formula_28

Hence,

and

<doc id="241865" wikidata="Q49167" url="?curid=241865" title="Wesleyan University">
<text>Wesleyan University ( ) is a private liberal arts university in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. It was founded in 1831 as a men&#x27;s college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown. It is currently a secular institution.

The college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women&#x27;s education established Connecticut College in 1912. Wesleyan, along with Amherst and Williams colleges, is part of &quot;The Little Three&quot;. Its teams compete athletically as a member of the NESCAC in NCAA Division III.

== History ==
Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Alden Partridge existed, consisting of the campus&#x27;s North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and founded in 1831 an all-male Methodist college. Willbur Fisk was the first president. Despite its name, Wesleyan was never an officially denominational seminary, though its curriculum and campus religious life were shaped by a heavy Methodist influence. In 1909, it built Judd Hall, named after alumnus Orange Judd, one of the earliest academic buildings devoted exclusively to undergraduate science instruction on any American college or university campus.

The Wesleyan student body numbered about 300 in 1910 and had grown to 800 in 1960.

Wesleyan is, along with Amherst and Williams colleges, a member of the Little Three. Wesleyan began as the smallest of the three. Later on, it expanded its programs, qualifying as a university with a variety of graduate offerings and became larger than the other two.

In 1872, the university became one of the first U.S. colleges to attempt coeducation by admitting a small number of female students, a venture then known as the &quot;Wesleyan Experiment&quot;. &quot;In 1909, the board of trustees voted to stop admitting women as undergraduates, fearing that the school was losing its masculine image and that women would not be able to contribute to the college financially after graduation the way men could.&quot; From 1912 to 1970, Wesleyan operated again as an all-male college.

Wesleyan became independent of the Methodist church in 1937. In 2000, the university was designated as a historic Methodist site.

Beginning in the late 1950s, president Victor Lloyd Butterfield began a reorganization program that resembled Harvard&#x27;s house system and Yale&#x27;s colleges. Undergraduate study would be divided into seven smaller residential colleges, with their own faculty and centralized graduate studies. Doctoral programs and a Center for Advanced Studies (later renamed the Center for the Humanities) were included in this reorganization.

The building program begun under this system created three residential colleges on Foss Hill (Foss Hill dormitories), followed by three more residential colleges (Lawn Avenue dormitories, now called Butterfield Colleges). Although the structures were built, only four of the proposed academic programs were begun. Two of those continue today: the College of Letters and the College of Social Studies. It has a student-faculty ratio of 7:1.

Butterfield&#x27;s successors, Edwin Deacon Etherington (class of 1948) and Colin Goetze Campbell, completed many innovations begun during Butterfield&#x27;s administration, including the return of women in numbers equal to men; a quadrupling in the total area of building space devoted to laboratory, studio, and performing arts instruction; and a significant rise in racial, ethnic, and religious diversity and total number of students.

==Campus==
Wesleyan occupies a campus, with over 340 buildings, including the five-building College Row; Olin Memorial Library; Andrus Public Affairs Center; the Exley Science Center; Shanklin and Hall-Atwater Laboratories; the Van Vleck Observatory; Fayerweather with Beckham Hall; Russell House, a National Historic Landmark; the Allbritton Center; the Butterfield dormitories; the Fauver Field dormitories; and the 11-building Center for the Arts complex.

When Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, it took over a campus with two buildings, North College and South College, from 1825. These were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge&#x27;s American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan.
The original North College was destroyed in a fire in 1906, but South College survived, being converted into offices that same year. The cupola and the belfry, which contains the Wesleyan Carillon, was designed by Henry Bacon and was added in 1916.

The original core buildings of the campus were North College and South College. North College, a Nassau Hall-type building seen in most early American college campuses, was replaced after a fire in 1909 with the current North College. South College is the sole building from the beginning

The northern end of High Street contains several large buildings that were former private residences, a few of which were exceptional architectural examples. These include Russell House, a National Historic Landmark, two Alsop family houses, (one is currently the African-American Studies center with student housing; the other is the Davison Art Center), the Davison infirmary, a second Russell family house that contains the University Development Office, and Downey House. High Street, which is the old center of campus, was once described by Charles Dickens as &quot;the most beautiful street in America&quot;.
==Undergraduate academics==
Wesleyan&#x27;s 46 undergraduate academic departments. 40% of Wesleyan graduates take double majors.

Wesleyan offers 3–2 programs in engineering with the California Institute of Technology and Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. These programs allow undergraduates to receive degrees in five years from both Wesleyan (B.A.) and Caltech or Columbia (B.Sc., Engineering). Additionally, Wesleyan offers a BA/MA Program in the sciences leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the fourth year and a master&#x27;s degree in the fifth year. Tuition for the fifth year of the master&#x27;s degree is waived.

Wesleyan does not require undergraduates to take prescribed courses. Freshmen are offered First Year Initiative seminars, and undergraduates are encouraged in the first two years of study to take a minimum of two courses from two different departments in diverse subject areas.

===Bailey College of the Environment===

The Bailey College of the Environment, created in 2009, integrates the following components: 1) a curricular component, including the newly established environmental studies major, the environmental studies certificate, and a senior capstone project; 2) a Think Tank of Wesleyan faculty, scholars of prominence, and undergraduates whose aim is to produce scholarly work that will influence national and international thinking and action on critical environmental issues; and 3) the Collaborative Research Initiative (CRI), which is designed to encourage COE majors with the most potential to undertake environmental research.

=== College of Film and the Moving Image ===
The university&#x27;s Film Studies program is led by film historian Jeanine Basinger. In 2008, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; said: &quot;This tiny Connecticut University, with a total enrollment of 2,700, has turned out a shockingly disproportionate number of Hollywood movers and shakers.&quot; Similarly, in 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine noted Basinger&#x27;s contribution to the film industry through her work in the Wesleyan Film Studies program, and the large number of alumni of the program now working in Hollywood. University students, biographers, media experts, and scholars from around the world may have full access to The Wesleyan Cinema Archives, which document the film industry during the 20th century and contain the personal papers and film related materials of Ingrid Bergman, Frank Capra, Clint Eastwood, Federico Fellini, Elia Kazan, Frank Perry, Roberto Rossellini, Robert Saudek, Martin Scorsese, Gene Tierney, Raoul Walsh, and John Waters, amongst others.

In February 2013, Wesleyan announced the creation of a new College of Film and the Moving Image, incorporating the Film Studies Department, the Center for Film Studies, the Cinema Archives and the Wesleyan Film Series.

===College of Integrative Sciences===

The College of Integrative Sciences (CIS) provides students with an interdisciplinary education in the sciences, and combines it with hands-on problem solving skills in research. To build interdisciplinary expertise, students must complete both a traditional major in science or mathematics, as well as a &quot;linked&quot; major that combines components from other disciplines to form a coherent plan of study.

===College of Letters===

The College of Letters is an interdisciplinary humanities program offering a three-year B.A. major for the integrative study of European literature, history, and philosophy.

===College of Social Studies===

The College of Social Studies (CSS) was founded in 1959, combining the fields of history, economics, government, and philosophy. Students take 5.5 of the program&#x27;s 10.5 (thesis-writing students take 11.5) required credits during their sophomore year. Sophomore year focuses on the development of modern Western society from historical, economic, social and political perspectives, and culminates with comprehensive final exams. Seniors are required to write an honors thesis (full year) or senior essay.

===Science and mathematics===
Wesleyan is the sole undergraduate liberal arts college to be designated a Molecular Biophysics Predoctoral Research Training Center by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

===Theater===
Wesleyan&#x27;s theater program has two theater facilities: the Theatre in the Center for the Arts, a 400-seat space; and the &#x27;92 Theater, home to Spike Tape, which is a student-run theater organization. Spike Tape produces upwards of five plays and musicals a semester, completely run by undergraduate students. They can be found at spiketapewes.com.

===Twelve College Exchange===
Many students participate in the Twelve College Exchange program, which allows for study for a semester or a year at another of the twelve college campuses: Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wheaton, and the Williams/Mystic Seaport Program in Maritime Studies.

==Graduate academics==
Wesleyan has 11 graduate departmental programs in the sciences, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and music. Graduates receive the Master of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Like in many traditional liberal arts colleges in the United States, all of Wesleyan&#x27;s master&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees are designated &quot;of Arts&quot; by historical precedent, regardless of the field of study. Wesleyan also offers a Graduate Liberal Studies Program. Graduates receive the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) or the Master of Philosophy in Liberal Arts (MPHIL) degrees.

===Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)===
Beginning in 2012, Wesleyan became the first small liberal arts college to partner with a private consortium to design and offer free public access online courses. Wesleyan teaches online courses in Math, Computer Science, Law, Psychology, and Literature, as well as other subjects.

==Academic profile==

===Admissions===

For the Class of 2027 (enrolling Fall 2023), Wesleyan received 14,500 applications and accepted 2,280 (15.7%). The median SAT score for admitted freshmen was 770 for math and 750 for evidence-based reading and writing. The median ACT score was 34 for the composite. Since 2014, Wesleyan has been test optional.

Admission standards at Wesleyan are considered &quot;most selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The Princeton Review gives the university an admissions selectivity rating of 96 out of 99.

Wesleyan announced in July 2023 that it would no longer give preference in admission to applicants with family or donor ties to the school, officially ending legacy admission at the institution.

===Rankings and reputation===
In the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Wesleyan University is tied for 14th overall among national liberal arts colleges. In the 2024 edition, it was ranked first in &quot;Best Colleges for Veterans&quot;, 16th in &quot;Best Value Schools&quot;, and tied for 36th in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;. Wesleyan University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

In the &quot;Forbes&quot; ranking of the top 500 American colleges for 2024-25, which combines national research universities, liberal arts colleges and military academies in a single survey, Wesleyan University is ranked 54th overall and 12th among liberal arts colleges alone. In another recent Forbes ranking, Wesleyan placed ninth nationally and third among liberal arts colleges. According to a study entitled &quot;Revealed Preference Ranking&quot; published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Wesleyan ranks No. 22 among all colleges and universities, and No. 5 among liberal arts colleges only. The stated purpose of the NBER study was to produce a ranking system that &quot;would be difficult for a college to manipulate&quot; by basing it on the actual demonstrated preferences of highly meritorious students. Wesleyan was listed on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education&#x27;s 2016 &quot;10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech&quot;.

&quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Wesleyan third in 2022, out of 203 liberal arts colleges in the U.S., based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

In 2019 &quot;Kiplinger&quot; ranked Wesleyan 16th of the 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.

==Libraries==
Olin Memorial Library has more than 1.8 million volumes and approximately 10,000 serial subscriptions. Wesleyan&#x27;s first library was Rich Hall (now &#x27;92 Theater), which was built just after the Civil War. Olin Library was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, built 1925–1927, and dedicated in 1928.

The second largest library on campus is the Science Library, which houses over two hundred fifty thousand volumes.

The Art Library is housed on the second floor of Olin Library. Davison Art Center holds the Print Reference Library. There is also a Music Library (which includes scores and recordings and the World Music Archives) and several department libraries. In 2024, the sound-art work &quot;Minute/Year&quot; was installed in the main library stairwell.

==Davison Art Center==

Davison Art Center is in Alsop House, which is designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The Art Center has a large collection consisting primarily of works on paper, including 18,000 prints, 6,000 photographs, several hundred drawings, a small number of paintings, and three-dimensional objects (including artists&#x27; books, sculptures, and other objects). The print collection has works by Dürer, Goya, Rembrandt, Manet, and others.

The museum&#x27;s educational program includes student museum internships and student-curated exhibitions.
==Student life==
===Cannon Scrap===

In the late 1860s, a yearly contest, the &quot;Cannon Scrap,&quot; began between the freshmen, whose mission it was to fire the Douglas Cannon on February 22, and the sophomores, who were charged with foiling the effort. In 1957, the tradition of stealing the cannon began in earnest.

===Religious life===
The university employs a Jewish rabbi, a Protestant chaplain, and a Muslim chaplain. There is program housing for Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and Jews.

===Athletics===
Wesleyan is a member of the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), fielding intercollegiate varsity teams in 29 sports. It competes against traditional Little Three rivals Amherst and Williams. Approximately 600 students participate in intercollegiate varsity sports each year. Wesleyan is one of the 39 founding members of the NCAA. Wesleyan&#x27;s football and baseball field, Andrus Field, is the oldest continuously used American football field in the world and the oldest continuously used baseball field in the world.

With alumni including Bill Belichick, Eric Mangini, and Field Yates, the school has been described by ESPN as a &quot;hotbed for great football minds.&quot; Led by coach John Raba, the winningest lacrosse coach in NESCAC history, the Wesleyan&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Lacrosse team won the Division III NCAA championship title in 2018. It was the first national championship in school history.

Amos Magee helped lead Wesleyan University to an ECAC Soccer Championship and school-best record of 15–1–1 in 1991, and is the Cardinals&#x27; all-time leading scorer (35 goals and 85 points). He was a National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) Division III All-American in 1992, four times was named all-New England, and was inducted into the Wesleyan University Hall of Fame.

===Student groups and organizations===
In February 2011, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; described the university as one of &quot;20 Colleges Where It&#x27;s Easiest to Get Involved&quot; with a &quot;Students per Club&quot; ratio of &quot;11.66&quot;. At that time there were around 270 student groups available to the 3,148 enrolled students.

====Wesleyan Student Assembly====
The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) is a body of 38 students elected annually to represent Wesleyan University&#x27;s undergraduate student body. The members of the assembly serve as student advocates in all areas of the university, including matters related to student life, academics, university finances, and campus facilities.

====Debate====
The Debate Society was founded in 1903 and later named in honor of Woodrow Wilson, who had been a professor at Wesleyan between 1888 and 1890 and who &quot;became deeply involved in extracurricular student activities such as the [Wesleyan] debate society.&quot; He &quot;stimulated students to organize opportunity for debate through a House of Commons similar to the one he had started at Johns Hopkins in 1884.&quot;

====Environmental====
Another student group is the Environmental Organizers&#x27; Network (EON), which campaigns on environmental issues. Wesleyan also owns a tract of land that is used as Long Lane Farm, a organic vegetable farm run by students.

====Publications====
Some of the oldest and most visible student groups are campus publications, including a bi-weekly newspaper, &quot;The Wesleyan Argus&quot; and a periodical, &quot;Hermes&quot;, the university&#x27;s oldest student-run publication. Until 2008, the student body published the &quot;Olla Podrida&quot; which was originally a quarterly newspaper in the late 1850s, but was the college yearbook since the Civil War. The &quot;Argus&quot; is the campus newspaper. Wesleying is a student-run weblog that documents undergraduate life at Wesleyan, often receiving up to 10,000 page views a day.

====Singing groups====
Wesleyan was long known as the &quot;Singing College of New England.&quot; The university&#x27;s &quot;tradition as a &#x27;singing college&#x27; had its roots in the vitality of Methodist hymnody.&quot; In 1862, a university glee club made the first tour of Wesleyan singers. The Wesleyan glee club organized by students frequently traveled and performed from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century and was considered among the best collegiate glee clubs in the late 19th century. It traveled widely giving concerts, including being received twice at the White House (in 1901 by President McKinley and again in 1928 by President Coolidge) and being recorded onto a phonograph record by Thomas Edison. University alumni published the first edition of &quot;The Wesleyan Song Book&quot; in 1901. Subsequently, the Glee Club twice won the National Intercollegiate Glee Club Competition at Carnegie Hall. Since the Glee Club&#x27;s disbanding, the tradition of choral singing has been carried on by the Wesleyan Singers, later renamed the Wesleyan Concert Choir, and then renamed again The Wesleyan Ensemble Singers (2010). This tradition also continues today in several student-run a cappella groups on campus, including the Wesleyan Spirits, the university&#x27;s oldest group. There are at least 13 groups that perform on campus regularly, with others occasionally created and disbanded, including Triple Major, Notably Sharp, The Cardinal Sinners, The Mazeltones, The Mixolydians, and numerous others.

===Greek organizations and secretive societies===

Wesleyan has chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Psi Alpha, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE).
However, the only organizations that are active and have society houses on campus (as of 2024), are ADP, Psi U, and The Eclectic Society.

In September 2014, Wesleyan ordered all fraternities with on-campus housing to become co-educational within the next three years.
In 2015, Wesleyan University ordered the closure of the DKE fraternity house on High Street. In 2017, DKE won the claim against Wesleyan University in a court trial. The jury awarded damages of $386,000 to the Kent Literary Club, DKE&#x27;s Wesleyan alumni chapter.

Secretive societies on campus include the Skull &amp; Serpent, Theta Nu Epsilon, Cloak, The Cannon Society, Pigs of Patio, and two Mystical Sevens.

=== International students ===
In 2023, around 10 percent of the student body holds citizenship other than that of the United States. There is financial aid available for students from Africa and Asia.

==Literary, media, and cultural references==
More than 30 books have been published concerning the university, including: &quot;The Wesleyan Song Book&quot;, by Karl P. Harrington and Carl F. Price (1901); &quot;The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education&quot;, by Upton Sinclair (1923); &quot;Wesleyan&#x27;s First Century With an Account of the Centennial Celebration&quot;, by Carl F. Price (1932); &quot;Wesleyan University, 1831–1910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England&quot;, by David B. Potts (1999); &quot;The Gatekeepers: Inside The Admissions Process of a Premier College&quot;, by Jacques Steinberg (2002); &quot;One Hundred Semesters: My Adventures as Student, Professor, and University President, and What I Learned along the Way&quot;, by William M. Chace (14th president of Wesleyan) (2006); &quot;A History of the Eclectic Society of Phi Nu Theta, 1837–1970&quot;, by William B.B. Moody (2007); &quot;Hidden Ivies: Thirty Colleges of Excellence&quot;, by Howard Greene and Matthew Greene (2000); &quot;Hidden Ivies: 50 Top Colleges that Rival the Ivy League&quot;, by Howard Greene and Matthew Greene (2009); &quot;Music at Wesleyan: From Glee Club to Gamelan&quot; by Mark Slobin (2010).

John Maher&#x27;s 1995 work &quot;Thinker, Sailer, Brother, Spy: A Novel&quot; features a fictional look at the life of a professor (a principal character) in the &quot;hothouse atmosphere of Wesleyan University...&quot; Two of Robert Ludlum&#x27;s novels are set partially at Wesleyan, &quot;The Matlock Paper&quot; much of the action takes place in and around the campus of a thinly disguised Wesleyan, and also &quot;The Chancellor Manuscript&quot; where Ludlum refers to Wesleyan as &#x27;a wealthy but minor university&#x27;.

The 1963 comedic novel, &quot;Night and Silence Who is Here?&quot;, by novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson, is thought by many literary critics to be patterned humorously after Wesleyan&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Studies (now the Center for the Humanities); the main characters comprise and parallel the cast of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. &quot;The Eclectic Society&quot;, a play that premiered on 27 January 2010 at the Walnut Street Theatre is based upon the Eclectic Society at the university during the early 1960s. In the 2012 novel &quot;Dream School&quot;, by novelist Blake Nelson, the protagonist attends an eastern liberal arts college, Wellington College, modeled on Wesleyan.

Characters in several television series have been portrayed as Wesleyan students or graduates. They include &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (characters Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin), &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing.&quot;

The 1994 cult comedy film &quot;PCU&quot; was based on (and filmed in part at) Wesleyan, the alma mater of the screenplay&#x27;s two writers, Adam Leff and Zak Penn, and represents &quot;an exaggerated view of contemporary college life...&quot; centering on a fictionalized version of the Eclectic Society, known in the film as &quot;The Pit.&quot;

In the autumn of 2010, the Pulitzer prize-winning comic strip &quot;Doonesbury&quot; by Garry Trudeau featured the university in a series of daily strips.

In 2015, Rolling Stone published a long form feature on Wesleyan&#x27;s drug culture titled &quot;Inside the Wesleyan Molly Bust&quot;, where dozens of students overdosed on tainted ecstasy, leading to the expulsion of five students.

==Notable alumni and faculty==

Wesleyan alumni have received external fellowships, including Fulbright, Goldwater, Marshall, Rhodes, Truman, and Watson. For the years 2007 through 2011, a total of 42 Wesleyan students and alumni received scholarships under the Fulbright program. The university has had at least 87 Watson Fellows since the inception of the program in 1968.

Former Wesleyan faculty and affiliates V. S. Naipaul, Woodrow Wilson, and T. S. Eliot have been awarded Nobel Prizes. Gary Yohe, current professor of economics, won a 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Satoshi Omura, Max Tishler Professor of Chemistry, was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize for Medicine. Former faculty and affiliates Richard Wilbur, Mark Strand, and Donald Hall were United States Poets Laureate. Composers John Cage and Steve Lehman were both affiliated with the university. Musician Anthony Braxton was an educator and chairman of music at the university for over 20 years, he&#x27;s received many awards for his career in music. Television notables include writers and co-creators of How I Met Your Mother, Craig Thomas and Carter Bays. Film notables include Joss Whedon, a producer, director, screenwriter, comic book writer, and composer; Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of &quot;Hamilton&quot;, won a Pulitzer Prize, three Grammy Awards, two Emmy Awards, a MacArthur Fellowship, and three Tony Awards; Mike White, a filmmaker and creator of the award-winning show The White Lotus; and Michael Bay, film producer and director. Tierney Sutton is a multiple Grammy-nominated jazz singer.

<text>The Centre Party, ( , Kesk; , C) officially the Centre Party of Finland, is an agrarian-centrist political party in Finland.
Ideologically, the Centre Party is positioned in the centre of the political spectrum. It has been described as being liberal, social-liberal, liberal-conservative, and conservative-liberal. The party’s leader is Antti Kaikkonen, who was elected in June 2024 to succeed former minister Annika Saarikko. As of June 2023, the party has been a part of the parliamentary opposition.

Founded in 1906 as the Agrarian League (; ), the party represented rural communities and supported the decentralisation of political power from Helsinki. In the 1920s, the party emerged as the main rival to the SDP. Kyösti Kallio, the party&#x27;s first prime minister, held the office for four times between 1922 and 1937. After World War II, the party settled as one of the four major political parties in Finland, alongside the SDP, the National Coalition Party and the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League until the 1980s. Urho Kekkonen served as President of Finland from 1956 to 1982, by far the longest period of any president. The name Centre Party was adopted in 1965 and Centre of Finland in 1988. The Centre Party was the largest party in Parliament from 2003 to 2011, during which time Matti Vanhanen was prime minister for seven years. By 2011, the party was reduced in parliamentary representation from the largest party to the fourth largest, but it reclaimed its status as the largest party in 2015. In 2019, it suffered a considerable defeat, losing 18 of 49 seats.

As a Nordic agrarian party, the Centre Party&#x27;s political influence is greatest in small and rural municipalities, where it often holds a majority of the seats in the municipal councils. Decentralisation is the policy that is most characteristic of the Centre Party which has been the ruling party in Finland a number of times since Finnish independence. Twelve of the Prime Ministers of Finland, three of the Presidents and a former European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs have been from the party. The Centre Party is the mother organisation of the Finnish Centre Students, the Finnish Centre Youth and the .

== History ==

=== Founding ===

The party was founded in 1906 as a movement of citizens in the Finnish countryside. Before Finnish independence, political power in Finland was centralised in the capital and to the estates of the realm. The centralisation gave space for a new political movement. In 1906, two agrarian movements were founded. They merged in 1908 to become one political party known as the Agrarian League or &quot;Maalaisliitto&quot;. An older, related movement was the temperance movement which had overlapping membership and gave future to Agrarian League activists experience in working in an organisation.

=== Santeri Alkio&#x27;s ideology ===
Soon the ideas of humanity, education, the spirit of the land, peasant-like freedom, decentralisation, &quot;the issue of poor people&quot;, progressivism and later the &quot;green wave&quot; became the main political phrases used to describe the ideology of the party. Santeri Alkio was the most important ideological father of the party.

=== Defending the republic ===
At the dawn of Finnish independence, conservative social forces made an attempt to establish the Kingdom of Finland. The Agrarian League opposed monarchism fiercely, even though monarchists claimed that a new king from the German Empire and Hohenzollern would have safeguarded Finnish foreign relations. At this time, anti-anarchist peasants threatened the existence of the party.

Because around forty Social Democratic members of the Parliament had escaped to Russia after the Finnish Civil War and about fifty others had been arrested, the Agrarian League members of the Parliament became the only republicans in Parliament in 1918. Nevertheless, the news about the problems of the German Empire from German liberals encouraged the fight of Agrarian League in the Parliament.

The Agrarian League managed to maintain the republican voices in the Parliament until the fall of the German Empire which ruined the dreams of the monarchists. The relentless opposition to the monarchy was rewarded in the 1919 Finnish parliamentary election and the party became the biggest non-socialist party in Finland with 19.7% of the votes.

=== Post-war period ===
After the 1919 Finnish parliamentary election, the centrist and progressive forces, including the Agrarian League, were constant members in Finnish governments. Their moderate attitude in restless post-war Finland secured a steady growth in following elections. The party formed many centrist minority governments with National Progressive Party and got its first Prime Ministers (Kyösti Kallio in 1922 and Juho Sunila in 1927).

=== Conciliation between the left and the right ===
For the Agrarian League, the centrist governments were just a transitional period toward an era which would integrate the red and white sides of the Civil War into one nation. Nevertheless, not everyone was happy with the conciliatory politics of centrist governments. The extreme right Lapua Movement grew bigger and bigger in the Agrarian League strongholds in the countryside. Many party members joined the new radical movement. The Lapua Movement organised assaults and kidnappings in Finland between 1929 and 1932. In 1930, after the kidnapping of progressive president Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg, the Agrarian League broke off all its ties to the movement and got a new political enemy in the countryside, the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement (IKL) which was founded after the Lapua Movement was outlawed.

In the 1933 Finnish parliamentary election, the main campaign issues were the differing attitudes toward democracy and the rule of law between the Patriotic Electoral Alliance (the National Coalition Party and the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement) and the Legality Front (the Social Democrats, the Agrarian League, the Swedish People&#x27;s Party and the Progressives). The Patriotic Electoral Alliance favoured continuing the search for suspected communists, the Communist Party and its affiliated organisations in the spirit of the Lapua Movement. The Legality Front did not want to spend any significant time on searching suspected communists but rather wanted to concentrate on keeping the far-right in check. The Legality Front won the elections, but the Agrarian League lost a part of its support.

=== Cooperation with the Social Democrats ===

Because of fierce opposition of the president Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the Social Democrats remained outside the government and the Agrarian League was part of the centre-right governments until 1937. In the 1937 Finnish presidential election, the Agrarian League candidate Kyösti Kallio was elected president with the votes of centrist (Agrarian and Progressive) and social-democratic coalition which wanted to ensure that President Svinhufvud would not be re-elected. The new president allowed the first centre-left government to be formed in Finland and a new era had begun.

=== World War II ===
With the outbreak of the Winter War, a government of national unity was formed. President Kallio died shortly after the war.

=== Kekkonen, the centrist statesman ===

In 1956, Urho Kekkonen, the candidate of the Agrarian League, was elected President of Finland after serving as prime minister several times and remained president until 1982. Kekkonen continued the active neutrality policy of his predecessor Juho Kusti Paasikivi, a doctrine which came to be known as the Paasikivi–Kekkonen line. Under it, Finland retained its independence while being able to trade with NATO members and those of the Warsaw Pact.

=== Pressure of populism ===
Veikko Vennamo, a vocal agrarian politician, ran into serious disagreement particularly with the then-Party Secretary of the Agrarian Party Arvo Korsimo, who was excluded from the parliamentary group. As a result, Vennamo immediately started building his own organisation in 1959 and founded a new party, the Finnish Rural Party (&quot;Suomen maaseudun puolue&quot;, SMP). Vennamo was a populist and became a critic of Kekkonen and political corruption within the old parties, particularly the Agrarian League. Although this party had some success, it was essentially tied to Veikko Vennamo&#x27;s person. His son Pekka Vennamo was able to raise the party to new success and into government in 1983, but after this the Rural Party&#x27;s support declined steadily and eventually the party went bankrupt in 1995. Immediately after this, the right-wing populist Finns Party (&quot;Perussuomalaiset&quot;) was founded by former members of SMP.

=== Transformation into the Centre Party ===
In 1965, the party changed its name to the Centre Party (&quot;Keskustapuolue&quot;) and in 1988 took its current Centre Party of Finland name (&quot;Suomen Keskusta&quot;). Despite urbanisation of Finland and a temporary nadir in support, the party managed to continue to attract voters.

The Liberal People&#x27;s Party (LKP) became a member party of the Centre Party in 1982. The two separated again after the success of the Liberal People&#x27;s Party in the 1985 Swedish general election.

=== Division over EU membership ===

The Centre Party was a key player in making the decision to apply for Finnish EU membership in 1992. As the leading governing party, its support for the application was crucial. The party itself, both leadership and supporters, was far from united on the issue. In the Parliament, 22 out of 55 Centre MPs voted against the application. In June 1994, the party congress decided to support EU membership (by 1607 votes to 834), but only after the Prime Minister and Party Chair Esko Aho threatened to resign if the party were to oppose the membership.

The centrist tradition of defending equal political and economic rights for peripheral areas was reflected in the internal resistance that opposed chairperson Aho&#x27;s ambitions to lead Finland into the EU. The Centre Party was in opposition from 1995 to 2003 and opposed adopting the euro as Finland&#x27;s currency. The party accepted the euro after regaining power in 2003.

=== 2012 and beyond ===
The party congress in June 2012 elected the newcomer Juha Sipilä to replace Mari Kiviniemi as the party&#x27;s chair. Sipilä defeated young deputy chairperson Tuomo Puumala and a well known veteran politician Paavo Väyrynen in the voting.

The previous chairperson Mari Kiviniemi succeeded Matti Vanhanen as Prime Minister in 2010, serving in the office for one year. At the time, she was the Centre Party’s third Prime Minister of Finland in succession. Anneli Jäätteenmäki preceded Vanhanen, she was also the first woman to be Prime Minister of Finland. She did not seek another term as party chair.

Olli Rehn, a member of the party, served in the European Commission for ten years between 2004 and 2014 and was the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs and the Euro from 2010 to 2014.

The Centre Party was the biggest loser of the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election, losing 16 seats and going from largest party to fourth place. Its support was lower than in any parliamentary election since 1917. It won the 2015 Finnish parliamentary election and formed a coalition with the Finns Party and the National Coalition Party.

In March 2016, the Centre Party announced that its candidate for the 2018 Finnish presidential election would be the former Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, the first declared presidential candidate in the race.

The Centre Party was again the biggest loser in the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election, losing 18 seats and going from largest party to fourth place. The party&#x27;s support was even lower than in 2011. Due to the devastating defeat, Sipilä consequently announced that he would continue as the party chair only until the Centre Party&#x27;s next convention in September 2019. The party congress in September 2019 elected the Minister of Economic Affairs Katri Kulmuni to replace Sipilä as the party&#x27;s chair.

On 5 September 2020, during a party congress, Annika Saarikko was elected as the leader of the Centre Party to replace Katri Kulmuni.

During late 2022, The Centre Party was polling at its lowest record in support in polls with less than 10% support.

== Ideology ==
The ideology of the party is unusual in the European context. Unlike many other large parties in Europe, its ideology is not primarily based on economic systems. Rather, the ideas of humanity, education, the spirit of the land, peasant-like freedom, decentralisation, &quot;the issue of poor people&quot;, environmentalism and progressivism play a key role in Centre Party politician speeches and writings. From the very beginning of its presence, the party has supported the idea of decentralisation.

Despite belonging to the Liberal International, the Centre Party does not play quite the same role in Finnish politics as do liberal parties in other countries because the party evolved from agrarian roots.

The party has a more conservative wing, and prominent conservatives within the party such as Paavo Väyrynen have criticised overt economic and cultural liberalism. In addition, the 2010 party congress voted to oppose same-sex marriage. When the Finnish Parliament voted on same-sex marriage in 2014, 30 of the 36 Centre MPs voted against it.

The party is also divided on the issue of deepening European integration and contains a notable Eurosceptic faction based on its more rural interests. The party expressly rejects a federal Europe. The Centre Party was originally opposed to Finland&#x27;s membership in the euro currency, but the party later stated that it would not seek to withdraw from the Economic and Monetary Union once Finland had entered.

In Finland, there is no large party that supports liberalism &quot;per se&quot;. Instead, liberalism is found in most major parties including the Centre Party which supports decentralisation, free will, free and fair trade and small enterprise. The Centre Party characteristically supports decentralisation, particularly the decrease of central power, increase of the power of municipalities and the even population of the country. During the party&#x27;s premierships between 2003 and 2011, these policies were also manifested as transferrals of certain government agencies from the capital to smaller cities in the regions.

Throughout the period of Finland&#x27;s independence, the Centre Party has been the party most often represented in the government. The country&#x27;s longest-serving President, Urho Kekkonen, was a member of the party as were two other Presidents.

Today, only a small portion of the votes given to the party come from farmers. As such, the Centre Party draws support from a wide range of professions. Rural Finland and small towns still form the strongest base of support for the party, although it has also strived for a breakthrough in the major southern cities. In the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election, the party received 4.5% of the votes cast in the capital, Helsinki, compared to the 33.4% in the largely rural electoral district of Oulu.

== Organisation ==

=== Structure ===
In the organisation of the Centre Party, local associations dominate the election of party leaders, the selection of local candidates and drafting of policy. The headquarters in Apollonkatu, Helsinki leads financing and organisation of elections.

The party has 2,500 local associations which have 160,000 individual members. The local associations elect their representatives to the party congress which elects the party leadership and decide on policy. The local associations form also 21 regional organisations which have also their representatives in the party congress.

The party congress is the highest decision-making body of the party. It elects the chairperson, three deputy chairs, the secretary-general and the party council.

With 135 members, the party council is the main decision-making body between the party congresses. The party council elects the party government (excluding the leaders elected by the party congress) and the working committee. The party council, the party government and the Working Committee must have at least 40% representation of both sexes.

The Finnish Centre Students, the and the Finnish Centre Youth have their own local and regional organisations which also name their representatives to the party congress.

<text>The San Jose Earthquakes are an American professional soccer club based in San Jose, California. The Earthquakes compete in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Western Conference. Originally known as the San Jose Clash, the franchise began play in 1996 as one of the charter members of the league. The Earthquakes took part in the first game in MLS history, defeating D.C. United 1–0. The Earthquakes have won two MLS Cup titles (2001, 2003) and two Supporters&#x27; Shields (2005, 2012). In 2002, the team played in its first CONCACAF Champions Cup, making it to the quarterfinals. 
The team holds a fierce rivalry with the LA Galaxy known as the &quot;California Clásico&quot;.

In 2005, the then-owner of the Earthquakes, Anschutz Entertainment Group, announced plans of the team relocating to Houston due to failing efforts to secure a soccer-specific stadium in San Jose. The organization in Houston would be considered an expansion team by the league, eventually becoming the Houston Dynamo, which began play in 2006. The Earthquakes returned after a two-year hiatus, resuming play in 2008. Since 2015, the Earthquakes have played their home games at PayPal Park (named Avaya Stadium from 2015 to 2019 and Earthquakes Stadium in 2020). The team previously played its home games at Buck Shaw Stadium on the Santa Clara University campus in Santa Clara, California, from 2008 to 2014.

== History ==

=== San Jose Earthquakes (1974)===

In 1974, the Earthquakes became a franchise of the North American Soccer League where they competed during the duration of the league&#x27;s short-lived existence. Playing out of San Jose, the Earthquakes hosted world-class players like George Best on their own roster while receiving visiting star talent like Brazilian football legend, Pele. 

=== Founding and early years (1994–1999) ===

In 1994, Daniel Van Voorhis, former owner of the American Professional Soccer League&#x27;s San Jose Hawks, successfully led a San Jose bidding group that was awarded one of Major League Soccer&#x27;s inaugural teams. At that time, he handed over all existing Hawks player contracts, front-office resources and the rights to play in San Jose State University&#x27;s Spartan Stadium to MLS in exchange for Type C stock in the league. He also became the franchise&#x27;s investor-operator until outside concerns forced him to divest himself of these positions prior to the league&#x27;s launch and accept a buyout from the league, leaving the franchise league-owned for several years. Meanwhile, a direct connection to the earlier Earthquakes came in the person of Peter Bridgwater, named as general manager of the MLS team. Although Bridgwater still owned the rights to the Earthquakes name and logo, the team became known as the Clash at the urging of Nike, a major investor in MLS.

On December 7, 1995, Bridgwater hired Laurie Calloway as the team&#x27;s first coach, providing a second direct connection with the NASL Earthquakes, as well as a connection with the Hawks. On January 23, 1996, the Clash acquired US national team star Eric Wynalda, despite the fact that Wynalda and Calloway did not get along during their time together with the Hawks. The Clash&#x27;s connections to the Blackhawks continued when the club made the first trade in MLS history, sending Rhett Harty to the MetroStars for Troy Dayak.

San Jose was an integral part of the launching of MLS, hosting the league&#x27;s inaugural game at Spartan Stadium before a crowd of 31,683 on April 6, 1996. The crowd did not go away disappointed as San Jose won its first game on the first goal in MLS history from Eric Wynalda, defeating D.C. United 1–0. One month later, the club made history again, as they hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy in a match that drew 31,728 fans to Spartan Stadium, setting the record for attendance at a sporting event in the city of San Jose. But Wynalda and Calloway were soon at each other&#x27;s throats again, eventually leading to a locker room brawl between Wynalda and John Doyle. The skirmish reached memorable proportions when Wynalda hired an airplane to tow a banner demanding Calloway&#x27;s firing.

Although the Clash made the postseason in the inaugural MLS season in 1996, and Doyle earned recognition as the best MLS defender, the team floundered in 1997. By mid-season the team was sinking fast and Bridgwater fired Calloway and replaced him with Brian Quinn. The Clash finished 1997 at the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a 12–20 record. Things were no better in 1998, when the team finished 13–19 and well out of playoff contention. During the 1999 pre-season, the saga of player-coach antagonism continued when Richard Gough left the team after an argument with Quinn. By the end of 1999, Quinn was done and the team released him to hire Lothar Osiander.

=== Return of the Earthquakes (1999–2005) ===
The franchise&#x27;s official name changed from the Clash to the Earthquakes on October 27, 1999, as the historic name had better recognition among fans in the area. After missing four consecutive post-seasons with three different coaches, the Earthquakes hired head coach Frank Yallop days before the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Yallop&#x27;s personnel changes and deft coaching with the help of assistant coach Dominic Kinnear and goalkeeper coach Tim Hanley, along with the allocation of star forward Landon Donovan on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, quickly turned around the Earthquakes&#x27; on-field fortunes, spurring the biggest regular season turnaround in league history (from 29 points in 2000 to 45 points in 2001) and leading the team to a 2–1 MLS Cup 2001 overtime victory over the archrival Los Angeles Galaxy.

The Quakes followed with two consecutive runners-up finishes for the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield and a 4–2 MLS Cup 2003 win over the Chicago Fire. Prior to reaching the 2003 final, the Earthquakes had rallied from four goals down to beat the Galaxy, 5–4 on aggregate, in a first-round playoff that many MLS watchers described as the greatest in league history. Following the season, Yallop returned to his native Canada to coach the Canadian men&#x27;s national soccer team being named to the post on December 16. Assistant coach Kinnear was then promoted to head coach, and former San Jose player John Doyle was named as his assistant.

Having won two MLS Cup titles in three years, the Earthquakes were poised for greater success both on and off the field. However, in January 2004, general manager Johnny Moore, whose roots with the club dated back to his days as a player for the NASL Earthquakes, resigned after AEG and MLS considered allowing the team to be rebranded as &quot;San Jose America&quot; (with ownership to transfer to the owners of Mexico&#x27;s Club América). Earthquake fans were similarly outraged at the proposed rebranding, coming just months after the MLS Cup. Former Los Angeles Galaxy defender Alexi Lalas was named as Moore&#x27;s replacement. Under Lalas&#x27; management, the club planned a move to Houston. Meanwhile, when the Quakes&#x27; star player, Landon Donovan, played briefly in Germany, Lalas traded away his rights, enabling Lalas&#x27; former team, the Galaxy, to acquire him.

On the field, Kinnear led the team to two more playoff appearances, including an MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield win in 2005.

=== Hiatus and return (2006–2008) ===

Following the conclusion of the 2005 season, Earthquakes owner Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) were granted permission to potentially move the team if a local buyer could not be found within a 30-day window. After a city-led plan to build a soccer-specific stadium was rejected, AEG announced on December 15 that the team would move to Houston for the 2006 season. MLS announced that the Earthquakes name, colors, logo, wordmark, history and competitive records would not be transferred, similar to the Cleveland Browns deal in the National Football League, to be used by a future San Jose team. The San Jose franchise was officially put on hiatus while the players, head coach Dominic Kinnear and some of his coaching staff were moved to Houston; the team were initially named Houston 1836 and later the Houston Dynamo. The Houston Dynamo is technically considered an expansion team by MLS just as the Baltimore Ravens is by the NFL.

On May 24, 2006, an agreement was reached between Major League Soccer and the principal owners of the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, granting them a three-year exclusive option to develop a soccer-specific stadium and bring an expansion franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area. An expansion team under the Earthquakes name was formally awarded to the duo by MLS on July 18, 2007. While functionally being the 14th franchise to join MLS, the team retained all records, logos, colors and titles of the 1996–2005 franchise and is a continuation of that franchise. Michael Crowley, also Oakland A&#x27;s president at the time, led the relaunched franchise and served as president until 2010.

In October 2007, the Earthquakes announced they would be moving their offices from the Fairmont Hotel in downtown San Jose to an office park across the street from their temporary home, Buck Shaw Stadium, and across the Caltrain tracks from the location of the former FMC site. On November 6, 2007, the team announced that former Earthquakes coach Frank Yallop was returning to the team as head coach. According to ESPN.com, the Earthquakes compensated Yallop&#x27;s previous employer, the Los Angeles Galaxy, with a third-round pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.

=== Return to MLS ===

In 2008, England&#x27;s Darren Huckerby, the MLS Newcomer of the Year and Ireland&#x27;s Ronnie O&#x27;Brien, who made 28 appearances for the Earthquakes, helped anchor the offense, combining for 10 goals and 10 assists. Both played a key part of the team&#x27;s nine-game unbeaten streak that saw San Jose push towards a playoff berth. They also failed to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, losing to Real Salt Lake 4–0 in the first round of qualifying.

On January 27, 2009, Amway Global signed a three-year deal with the Earthquakes to become the team&#x27;s official jersey sponsor. The club made a historic trade on June 9, 2009, when they acquired Chris Wondolowski from Houston.

The Quakes missed out on the playoffs for a second consecutive season in 2009 but looked to build on a solid second half of the year, which saw them go 4–4–4 following the All-Star Break. The Earthquakes finished in 14th place and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The Earthquakes also failed to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, losing to New York Red Bulls on April 29, 2–1.

In 2010, the San Jose Earthquakes qualified for the playoffs as the West&#x27;s No. 6 seed with 46 points. In the 2010 MLS playoffs, they were matched up with the No. 1 seeded New York Red Bulls. After losing the first game by a score of 1–0, the Earthquakes defeated the Red Bulls in the second game by a score of 3–1 to win the aggregate, 3–2, and upset New York. In the single-elimination semi-final match against the Colorado Rapids, at Colorado, the Quakes suffered a 1–0 defeat.

In 2011, the San Jose Earthquakes missed the playoffs after they finished seventh in the west and fourteenth in all of MLS.

=== The Goonies (2012–2014) ===

In 2012, the San Jose Earthquakes had the best start in franchise history. The team established a habit of scoring late goals to tie or win games. The first was a match against Real Salt Lake on April 21, 2012, scoring 2 goals in stoppage time to win 3–1. The next week, a stoppage time goal produced a win against the Philadelphia Union. Two more games resulted in ties with late goals, both scored by Alan Gordon. On May 23, 2012, against the L.A. Galaxy, the Quakes scored 3 times in 18 minutes to win 3–2. After this game striker Steven Lenhart declared &quot;Goonies never say die!&quot; (a reference to the movie &quot;The Goonies&quot;), and this was made into the rally cry of the team.

The Quakes ended the 2012 regular season with 66 points and 72 goals, both team records, with 17 of those points created by goals scored in the 84th minute or later. The team clinched the Supporter&#x27;s Shield, its first major trophy since their return to San Jose, and qualified for their first CONCACAF Champion&#x27;s League tournament as a franchise in 2013. They returned to the playoffs for the first time since their 2010 season and faced two games against L.A. Galaxy. In their first playoff game, the Quakes scored a stoppage time goal to take the away leg 1–0, but were knocked out of the playoffs following a 3–1 loss at home (3–2 on aggregate), their only loss at Buck Shaw Stadium for the season.

In 2013, the Quakes began the year facing adversity with numerous players recovering from injury. With added depth in preparation for the upcoming CONCACAF Champions&#x27; League, they began the task of duplicating the success of 2012. While the style of scoring late goals were still present in games against New York, Portland and Montreal, the team struggled to find success and quickly found themselves at the bottom of the Western Conference. The slow start of the team led to the departure of coach Frank Yallop and Mark Watson was named interim coach.

On June 29, 2013, the Quakes played the L.A. Galaxy in the California Clásico. Despite being down 2–0 and having Victor Bernardez ejected, the Quakes staged another comeback, scoring twice in stoppage time to win 3–2, becoming the first MLS team to do so.

On August 7, 2013, the Earthquakes debuted in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League for the first time since their return to MLS. They lost the away game to the Montreal Impact 1–0. On October 23, 2013, the Earthquakes won group five on goal differential with a win at home against Heredia, and they moved on to the knockout stage of the tournament.

Despite a league best record in games played after June, the Quakes failed to qualify for the 2013 playoffs, losing the final spot to Colorado on a goal differential tiebreaker. The final home game of the season, a 2–0 win against FC Dallas, saw the final minutes of professional soccer for Ramiro Corrales, who had announced his retirement. Corrales was the last remaining active player who played in the inaugural season of MLS.

The Quakes in their 2014 campaign began, playing in the quarterfinals against Toluca in a two-game series in the 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League. Scoring a goal in stoppage time in the first game, the Quakes went to Mexico 1–1 on aggregate. In the second game, the game tied in regulation. The Quakes faced Toluca in Overtime where neither team could score against the other and the game went on to penalties. The Earthquakes lost 5–4 against Toluca in penalties and were eliminated.

San Jose ended the 2014 MLS Season with the club&#x27;s worst ever record, winning only 6 matches, and suffering a 15-match winless streak. That streak surpassed the Quakes&#x27; previous record of 13 in 2011, and matched the second worst in league history.

=== Return of Dominic Kinnear (2015–2017) ===

The Earthquakes welcomed back Dominic Kinnear to the club as coach after a nine-year tenure in Houston. The franchise&#x27;s long-awaited stadium, Avaya Stadium, was the first professional soccer-specific stadium in the Bay Area when it opened on March 22.

The 2015 season was a marked improvement over the previous season, but the Earthquakes still failed to reach the playoffs despite a late surge. Chris Wondolowski became only the ninth player in MLS history to score 100 goals with a penalty in a 1–1 draw against Orlando.

On August 29, 2016, the Earthquakes parted ways with longtime general manager John Doyle. Earthquakes President Dave Kaval stated that he felt the Earthquakes &quot;needed a fresh approach&quot;. Technical director Chris Leitch was appointed as interim GM.

=== The Fioranelli era (2017–2021) ===

Following the firing of John Doyle, it was announced on January 5, 2017, that Jesse Fioranelli had been hired as general manager. He joined San Jose from A.S. Roma and had previously also worked at Roma&#x27;s cross-city rival S.S. Lazio.

Fioranelli made clear early on that he would be prioritizing youth development, international scouting, and generally creating a new identity for San Jose that was younger, more dynamic, and more attacking, intentions which were reflected by his off-season acquisitions of Jahmir Hyka, Florian Jungwirth, Marco Ureña, Harold Cummings, and Danny Hoesen using Targeted Allocation Money. He also expressed the necessity of the team reaching the playoffs in 2017, as it had not done so since 2012. Illustrating the seriousness of his commitment to improving San Jose, within one week in April Fioranelli made two key additions to the technical staff with the hiring of Alex Covelo as Director of Methodology and Bruno Costa as Head of Scouting. Dave Kaval stepped down from his role as president on June 1, to be replaced by former Aston Villa F.C. chief executive and Arsenal F.C. chief commercial officer Tom Fox. On June 22, 2017, San Jose announced Fioranelli&#x27;s first Designated Player signing, Georgian attacking midfielder Vako, who would join San Jose from SBV Vitesse.

Fioranelli took his ambitions for San Jose a step further just several days later, when he announced on June 25, 2017, that Dominic Kinnear had been fired, and would be replaced immediately and permanently by Chris Leitch, the club&#x27;s technical director and former interim general manager. Assistant coach John Spencer was also let go, and was replaced by Covelo. The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2–1 at home. Fioranelli said of the firing that, coming off of a win, it was not reactionary, and rather he had &quot;in the last two to three months...matured a gut feeling as to where [the club stands]&quot;, and that his respect for Kinnear &quot;would not have allowed [him] to want to go for another three months knowing [they] would have parted ways at the end of the season&quot;. In his first interview as head coach, Leitch reiterated Fioranelli&#x27;s previously stated goals, saying that &quot;the goal of the team...is [to] make the playoffs&quot;. His first outing as head coach on June 28, 2017, was successful, seeing the Earthquakes achieve their first-ever victory over an MLS side in the U.S. Open Cup with a 2–1 victory against Seattle Sounders FC that would advance them to the USOC quarter finals for the first time since 2012.

Leitch&#x27;s first MLS match as head coach was a 2–1 win over the LA Galaxy at Stanford Stadium on July 1, in which Chris Wondolowski scored the equalizing goal off of an assist from goalkeeper David Bingham and substitute Shea Salinas scored the winner in the 93rd minute. The team experienced its first loss under Leitch three days later on July 4 at Bobby Dodd Stadium, in a 4–2 loss to Atlanta United FC following red cards to both Kofi Sarkodie and Victor Bernardez; however, this match also saw Tommy Thompson score his first league goal and Chris Wondolowski break Ramiro Corrales&#x27; record for career starts at San Jose with his 229th start, as well as tie the league record for most goals scored away at 63.

On July 7, 2017, a multi-year collaboration between the Earthquakes and the German Football Association was announced, &quot;focused on knowledge exchange, game development and machine learning&quot;.

On July 10, 2017, the Earthquakes defeated the Galaxy 3–2 at home, following a brace from Chris Wondolowski and Danny Hoesen&#x27;s second goal of the tournament, to advance to the semifinals of the U.S. Open Cup for the first time since 2004 and for only the second time in club history. Wondolowski wore the number 38 in this match in honor of teammate Matheus Silva, who nearly drowned the previous week. New signing Vako was introduced at the club for the first time during halftime. Vako made his club debut four days later as a 63rd minute substitution in San Jose&#x27;s 4–1 friendly defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt, and shortly afterwards scored in his MLS debut as a halftime substitute against the New York Red Bulls at Red Bull Arena on July 19.

The Earthquakes announced a second new partnership aimed at pursuing the implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning on July 21 with Los Angeles-based company Second Spectrum, Inc., the first of its kind in the league and inspired by the company&#x27;s partnerships with the NBA and specifically the Golden State Warriors. Per this agreement, a new system was installed at Avaya Stadium to track players during matches and gather data on tactics and performance, to be delivered to players&#x27; mobile devices directly after games. The signing of Swiss defender François Affolter from FC Luzern was announced later the same day.

San Jose lost in the Open Cup semifinals to Sporting Kansas City, for the second time in franchise history, in sudden death penalties on August 9.

On August 19, Wondolowski became the first player in MLS history to score ten or more goals in eight consecutive seasons, following his successful penalty kick in the dying moments of a 2–2 home draw against the Philadelphia Union, when Shea Salinas was tripped in the box by Joshua Yaro.

San Jose qualified for the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs, the club&#x27;s first playoff appearance since 2012, following a 3–2 win at home on October 22 over Minnesota United FC in which Danny Hoesen and Chris Wondolowski each recorded a goal and an assist, and substitute Marco Ureña scored the stoppage time winner. This sent the team on to play a knockout round match on the road against Vancouver Whitecaps FC on October 25. However, the team was defeated 5–0.

On November 24, 2017, Mikael Stahre, formerly of BK Häcken, was announced as the team&#x27;s new head coach. Leitch returned to his previous role as the club&#x27;s technical director. San Jose began to make roster moves not long after with contract options being declined for players, most notably for defender Víctor Bernárdez and goalkeeper David Bingham who spent six and seven years with the Earthquakes organization respectively. San Jose traded Bingham&#x27;s MLS rights to their rival Los Angeles Galaxy on December 18. December also brought additions to the roster, reflecting different aspects of San Jose&#x27;s leadership and management. On December 1, 2017, Joel Qwiberg was signed from IF Brommapojkarna where he had helped to lead the team to two consecutive promotions, reaching Sweden&#x27;s topic league. The next signing of the off-season was homegrown goalkeeper JT Marcinkowski, who had finished his 3rd year at Georgetown. Just over a week later, San Jose announced in a joint press conference with their USL affiliate Reno 1868 that they had signed three players from the team: Luis Felipe, Chris Wehan, and Jimmy Ockford. Reno&#x27;s club president elaborated on what the signings meant for both organizations, stating &quot;Today&#x27;s news delivers on that promise to compete in Reno while developing the future of San Jose.&quot; The next day San Jose continued on their developmental based signings with defender Jacob Akanyirige announced as signed straight from their academy at fifteen years old, San Jose&#x27;s youngest ever player and the eighth youngest player in MLS history. On December 20, the first Designated Player and second Swedish signing under Stahre&#x27;s tenure was officially brought to San Jose. Magnus Eriksson joined from Djurgårdens IF where he co-led the Allsvenskan as top scorer in the 2017 season.

Stahre was dismissed by the club before the end of his first year in charge, a season in which the team earned just four wins. On October 8, 2018, the club announced that they had hired reigning CONCACAF coach of the year Matias Almeyda, who would take charge for the 2019 season. On May 18, 2019, Wondolowski scored four goals against Chicago Fire. With his second goal, he set the league&#x27;s all-time scoring record. The team had a negative record and missed the playoffs by four points.

In 2020, the Earthquakes had a draw and a loss in their first two regular season games before the season was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When the season resumed with the MLS is Back tournament, the Earthquakes were drawn into Group B with FC Dallas (later replaced by the Chicago Fire), Seattle Sounders FC, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC. They drew with Seattle and defeated both Chicago and Vancouver, the latter with a thrilling comeback from a 3–1 deficit, to win the group and advance to the round of 16.

On April 18, 2022, the Earthquakes and Matias Almeyda agreed to part ways. Alex Covelo, the head coach of the newly established San Jose Earthquakes II side, stepped in as his interim replacement. Covelo was joined by an assistant coaching staff consisting of former San Jose player Chris Wondolowski, former assistant manager and interim manager Steve Ralston, and Earthquakes II assistant Luciano Fusco.

== Crest and jerseys ==
Since their inception, the Earthquakes have played in a color scheme featuring blue and black as dominant colors, usually with white highlights. The original San Jose Clash logo featured a stylized scorpion in black and red with a white &#x27;clash&#x27; wordmark.

When they rebranded to the Earthquakes in 2000, the team badge featured an inverted triangular shield containing a soccer ball invoking the rising sun used in the logo for the City of San Jose, a stylized &#x27;Earthquakes&#x27; wordmark, and a color palette of blue, black, white and silver. The three points of the triangular shield represented the three largest communities of the Bay Area (San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland).

The team rebranded again on January 30, 2014, to a new crest and uniform. While still featuring blue and black, as well as a new chevron design that invokes the geologic theme of the team&#x27;s name, the new design also featured the year 1974 in red; this is an explicit reference of lineage to the previous NASL incarnation of the Earthquakes that had founded that year.

On February 17, 2017, San Jose released its new home kit at a jersey release party at San Pedro Square. The new kit is black, a callback to the black Goonies kits of the historic 2012 season, and features the blue slipstrike design from the crest on the front. Also included is a red neck tape, referring again to the team&#x27;s NASL history, &quot;SJ 74&quot; in blue on the bottom left corner, and the words &quot;UNITY&quot;, &quot;DEVOTION&quot;, and &quot;HERITAGE&quot; written in white across the blue border on the right sleeve.

On February 11, 2018, the Earthquakes released their new away kit, the Navy SEAL Foundation Jersey, and announced that 5% of each jersey sale would be donated to the Foundation, becoming the first club in MLS history to donate part of its jersey revenue to a nonprofit organization. The jersey release party was held near the site of the USS Hornet Museum and the kit itself presented by a retired SEAL alongside squad members Tommy Thompson, Joel Qwiberg, and, offshore in a military rescue boat, Nick Lima and Jackson Yueill.

The 2020–2021 away jersey incorporated the colors of the flag of San Jose (blue, white, yellow).

U.S. Open Cup:
* Negoesco Stadium: San Francisco, California (July 24, 2001) vs LA Galaxy
* Cagan Stadium: Stanford, California (2011–2012)
* Kezar Stadium: San Francisco, California (2012, 2014)

On January 13, 2007, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; reported that the city of San Jose, San Jose State University and the Earthquakes owners were in negotiations to build a soccer stadium just east of the Earthquakes&#x27; previous home, Spartan Stadium. The new facility, to have 22,000 permanent seats but be expandable to a capacity of 30,000 for single games, would be privately built by Lewis Wolff and John Fisher, the primary owners of the Earthquakes, with San Jose State providing the needed land. Additionally, the team and the university would build community soccer fields across Senter Road in Kelley Park using San Jose municipal bond money that had been approved years earlier for the purpose but never spent. The plan was for the new version of the San Jose Earthquakes to play in Spartan Stadium during the 2008 MLS season, then move into the new stadium in 2009. Plans for the stadium collapsed on April 19 of that year after the Earthquakes and SJSU could not come to an agreement on revenue sharing.

=== PayPal Park ===
On May 8, the city of San Jose and Earthquakes Soccer, LLC confirmed that their new primary focus was on a site near San Jose International Airport on the site of the former FMC plant. The new site was owned by the city, which was exploring either leasing it to Earthquakes Soccer, LLC or selling it outright. The site is adjacent to not only the airport but the planned BART extension to Santa Clara and the existing Santa Clara Caltrain station, and near both Interstate 880 and U.S. Route 101. On June 12, 2007, the San Jose City Council voted unanimously to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to explore construction of a new stadium to bring MLS back to San Jose and adopted a resolution authorizing the city manager to enter into an Exclusive Right to Negotiate agreement with Wolff and his partners regarding the potential development of the former FMC site. The first payment on the new stadium land of $3 million was made in June 2008.

The preliminary designs were released to the public on September 19, 2009. Earthquakes Stadium was slated to be a three-sided European style stadium with 18,000 permanent seats and a grass berm at the open end.

On March 16, 2010, the San Jose city council voted 9–0 to rezone the Airport West property to allow for development of the new Earthquakes Stadium.

The San Jose Earthquakes franchise made history when 6,256 people participated in groundbreaking for the new stadium. This set a world record by Guinness World Records as the largest ever crowd to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony. The construction was completed in early 2015 and hosted its first event, a friendly, pre-season match against LA Galaxy, on February 28, 2015. The stadium&#x27;s official opening took place on March 22, 2015, when the Earthquakes hosted Chicago Fire for their first home game of the 2015 MLS regular season. Fatai Alashe scored the first official, regular-season goal at Avaya in the fifth minute of the 2–1 victory.

==Club culture==

=== Rivalries ===

The California Clásico is a rivalry between two Major League Soccer teams, the LA Galaxy and the San Jose Earthquakes, which existed from 1996 to 2005 and was resumed in 2008. It is considered to be one of the oldest rivalries in American soccer. The rivalry originated from the historical Northern California vs. Southern California sporting and cultural rivalries, as well as from the relative proximity of the cities (about 360 miles apart) which allows rival fans to attend each other&#x27;s games. While there have been several players to play for both teams beforehand, the rivalry intensified after the Anschutz Entertainment Group (owner of the Los Angeles Galaxy) took sole ownership of the San Jose Earthquakes in December 2002. The rivalry reached its peak from 2001 to 2005, during which time the Earthquakes and the Galaxy combined to win four MLS Cup titles in a five-year period. Both clubs reached MLS Cup 2001, with San Jose posting a 2–1 overtime victory on goals by Landon Donovan and Dwayne DeRosario.

The Heritage Cup with Seattle Sounders FC was begun in the 2009 MLS season by the respective supporters&#x27; groups. Any present or future MLS teams that carry on the names of their NASL predecessors are eligible for the Cup, but supporters of the other eligible MLS teams (Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps FC) have chosen not to participate. San Jose and Seattle have had a rivalry since the NASL. However, it did not completely resurface during the 2009 season with fans of both teams viewing other clubs as bigger rivals. That season, the first MLS meeting of the teams was not considered for the competition due to the schedule consisting of two games in Seattle and only one in San Jose. Seattle won the initial meeting at home 2–0 and the second 2–1. The Earthquakes won the inaugural cup on goals scored after a 4–0 home victory on August 2, 2009.

=== Support ===

Among the supporters&#x27; groups affiliated with the Earthquakes are the San Jose Ultras, Club Quake, Soccer Silicon Valley, The Casbah, The Faultline, and Epicentro74.

An Earthquakes fan was arrested for assaulting a Portland Timbers fan after taunting the group in April 2013. The 1906 Ultras responded via Twitter: &quot;arrests issue addressed&quot; and to be &quot;moving beyond the issue&quot; ahead of a travel ban that was lifted by Major League Soccer just days prior.

Punk musician, Lars Frederiksen is a supporter of the Earthquakes. Along with his band, The Old Firm Casuals, he wrote the new anthem and theme song, &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, for the club, which was performed as part of the team&#x27;s rebranding ceremony on January 30, 2014. The song features backing vocals by various team members. Frederiksen said of the team that they are the most &quot;punk rock&quot; team in the MLS.

=== Mascots ===
* José Clash (1996–1999)
* Rikter the CyberDog (2000–2002)
* Q (2004–2005), (2008–present)

On April 26, 2010, Q was one of three mascots featured on KNTV, along with San Jose Sharks mascot S.J. Sharkie and San Jose Giants mascot &quot;Gigante&quot;.

==Revenue and profitability==
At the beginning of 2013, the Quakes had 5,000 season ticket holders, and although revenues had been increasing, the Quakes stadium did not allow them to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable. Quakes management predicted in 2013 that season ticket sales would double once they move into their new stadium, and the Quakes would become profitable at that time. Management also stated that they are &quot;pursuing independent revenue streams that will provide the team with real and lasting financial freedom.&quot; With the completion of their new soccer-specific Avaya Stadium, in early 2015 the Earthquakes reached their cap of 12,000 season tickets sold.

=== Sponsorship ===
== Broadcasting ==
From 2023, every Earthquakes game will be carried on MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app, with select national games on Fox or Fox Sports 1. Prior to the streaming deal, the Earthquakes were seen on TV across the Bay Area on a number of stations, with the most recent linear partner being cable outlets NBC Sports Bay Area and NBC Sports California.

On the radio, all Earthquakes games are broadcast in English on 810 KGO (since 2023) and in Spanish on 1370 KZSF (since 2011). The English-language broadcast features Ted Ramey as the play-by-play announcer, and former Earthquakes goalkeeper Joe Cannon as the color analyst. Carlos César Rivera serves as the Spanish-language play-by-play announcer, while former Quakes defender Ramiro Corrales is the analyst.

<text>The bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) is a type of reaction mechanism that is common in organic chemistry. In the SN2 reaction, a strong nucleophile forms a new bond to an sp3-hybridised carbon atom via a backside attack, all while the leaving group detaches from the reaction center in a concerted (i.e. simultaneous) fashion.

The name SN2 refers to the Hughes-Ingold symbol of the mechanism: &quot;SN&quot; indicates that the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, and &quot;2&quot; that it proceeds via a bimolecular mechanism, which means both the reacting species are involved in the rate-determining step. What distinguishes SN2 from the other major type of nucleophilic substitution, the SN1 reaction, is that the displacement of the leaving group, which is the rate-determining step, is separate from the nucleophilic attack in SN1.

The SN2 reaction can be considered as an organic-chemistry analogue of the associative substitution from the field of inorganic chemistry.

==Reaction mechanism==
The reaction most often occurs at an aliphatic sp3 carbon center with an electronegative, stable leaving group attached to it, which is frequently a halogen (often denoted X). The formation of the C–Nu bond, due to attack by the nucleophile (denoted Nu), occurs together with the breakage of the C–X bond. The reaction occurs through a transition state in which the reaction center is pentacoordinate and approximately sp2-hybridised.
The SN2 reaction can be viewed as a HOMO–LUMO interaction between the nucleophile and substrate. The reaction occurs only when the occupied lone pair orbital of the nucleophile donates electrons to the unfilled σ* antibonding orbital between the central carbon and the leaving group. Throughout the course of the reaction, a p orbital forms at the reaction center as the result of the transition from the molecular orbitals of the reactants to those of the products.
To achieve optimal orbital overlap, the nucleophile attacks 180° relative to the leaving group, resulting in the leaving group being pushed off the opposite side and the product formed with inversion of tetrahedral geometry at the central atom.

For example, the synthesis of macrocidin A, a fungal metabolite, involves an intramolecular ring closing step via an SN2 reaction with a phenoxide group as the nucleophile and a halide as the leaving group, forming an ether. Reactions such as this, with an alkoxide as the nucleophile, are known as the Williamson ether synthesis.
If the substrate that is undergoing SN2 reaction has a chiral centre, then inversion of configuration (stereochemistry and optical activity) may occur; this is called the Walden inversion. For example, 1-bromo-1-fluoroethane can undergo nucleophilic attack to form 1-fluoroethan-1-ol, with the nucleophile being an HO− group. In this case, if the reactant is levorotatory, then the product would be dextrorotatory, and vice versa.
==Factors affecting the rate of the reaction==
The four factors that affect the rate of the reaction, in the order of decreasing importance, are:

===Substrate===
The substrate plays the most important part in determining the rate of the reaction. For SN2 reaction to occur more quickly, the nucleophile must easily access the sigma antibonding orbital between the central carbon and leaving group.

SN2 occurs more quickly with substrates that are more sterically accessible at the central carbon, i.e. those that do not have as much sterically hindering substituents nearby. Methyl and primary substrates react the fastest, followed by secondary substrates. Tertiary substrates do not react via the SN2 pathway, as the greater steric hindrance between the nucleophile and nearby groups of the substrate will leave the SN1 reaction to occur first.
Substrates with adjacent pi C=C systems can favor both SN1 and SN2 reactions. In SN1, allylic and benzylic carbocations are stabilized by delocalizing the positive charge. In SN2, however, the conjugation between the reaction centre and the adjacent pi system stabilizes the transition state. Because they destabilize the positive charge in the carbocation intermediate, electron-withdrawing groups favor the SN2 reaction. Electron-donating groups favor leaving-group displacement and are more likely to react via the SN1 pathway.
===Nucleophile===
Like the substrate, steric hindrance affects the nucleophile&#x27;s strength. The methoxide anion, for example, is both a strong base and nucleophile because it is a methyl nucleophile, and is thus very much unhindered. &quot;tert&quot;-Butoxide, on the other hand, is a strong base, but a poor nucleophile, because of its three methyl groups hindering its approach to the carbon. Nucleophile strength is also affected by charge and electronegativity: nucleophilicity increases with increasing negative charge and decreasing electronegativity. For example, OH− is a better nucleophile than water, and I− is a better nucleophile than Br− (in polar protic solvents). In a polar aprotic solvent, nucleophilicity increases up a column of the periodic table as there is no hydrogen bonding between the solvent and nucleophile; in this case nucleophilicity mirrors basicity. I− would therefore be a weaker nucleophile than Br− because it is a weaker base. Verdict - A strong/anionic nucleophile always favours SN2 manner of nucleophillic substitution.

===Leaving group===
Good leaving groups on the substrate lead to faster SN2 reactions. A good leaving group must be able to stabilize the electron density that comes from breaking its bond with the carbon center. This leaving group ability trend corresponds well to the p&quot;K&quot;a of the leaving group&#x27;s conjugate acid (p&quot;K&quot;aH); the lower its p&quot;K&quot;aH value, the faster the leaving group is displaced.

Leaving groups that are neutral, such as water, alcohols (), and amines (), are good examples because of their positive charge when bonded to the carbon center prior to nucleophilic attack. Halides (, , and , with the exception of ), serve as good anionic leaving groups because electronegativity stabilizes additional electron density; the fluoride exception is due to its strong bond to carbon.

Leaving group reactivity of alcohols can be increased with sulfonates, such as tosylate (), triflate (), and mesylate (). Poor leaving groups include hydroxide (), alkoxides (), and amides ().
The Finkelstein reaction is one SN2 reaction in which the leaving group can also act as a nucleophile. In this reaction, the substrate has a halogen atom exchanged with another halogen. As the negative charge is more-or-less stabilized on both halides, the reaction occurs at equilibrium.
===Solvent===
The solvent affects the rate of reaction because solvents may or may not surround a nucleophile, thus hindering or not hindering its approach to the carbon atom. Polar aprotic solvents, like tetrahydrofuran, are better solvents for this reaction than polar protic solvents because polar protic solvents will hydrogen bond to the nucleophile, hindering it from attacking the carbon with the leaving group. A polar aprotic solvent with low dielectric constant or a hindered dipole end will favour SN2 manner of nucleophilic substitution reaction. Examples: dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acetone, etc. In parallel, solvation also has a significant impact on the intrinsic strength of the nucleophile, in which strong interactions between solvent and the nucleophile, found for polar protic solvents, furnish a weaker nucleophile. In contrast, polar aprotic solvents can only weakly interact with the nucleophile, and thus, are to a lesser extent able to reduce the strength of the nucleophile.

==Reaction kinetics==
The rate of an SN2 reaction is second order, as the rate-determining step depends on the nucleophile concentration, [Nu−] as well as the concentration of substrate, [RX].

:r = k[RX][Nu−]

This is a key difference between the SN1 and SN2 mechanisms. In the SN1 reaction the nucleophile attacks after the rate-limiting step is over, whereas in SN2 the nucleophile forces off the leaving group in the limiting step. In other words, the rate of SN1 reactions depend only on the concentration of the substrate while the SN2 reaction rate depends on the concentration of both the substrate and nucleophile.

It has been shown that except in uncommon (but predictable cases) primary and secondary substrates go exclusively by the SN2 mechanism while tertiary substrates go via the SN1 reaction. There are two factors which complicate determining the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions at secondary carbons:
# Many reactions studied are solvolysis reactions where a solvent molecule (often an alcohol) is the nucleophile. While still a second order reaction mechanistically, the reaction is kinetically first order as the concentration of the nucleophile–the solvent molecule, is effectively constant during the reaction. This type of reaction is often called a pseudo first order reaction.
# In reactions where the leaving group is also a good nucleophile (bromide for instance) the leaving group can perform an SN2 reaction on a substrate molecule. If the substrate is chiral, this inverts the configuration of the substrate before solvolysis, leading to a racemized product–the product that would be expected from an SN1 mechanism. In the case of a bromide leaving group in alcoholic solvent Cowdrey et al. have shown that bromide can have an SN2 rate constant 100-250 times higher than the rate constant for ethanol. Thus, after only a few percent solvolysis of an enantiospecific substrate, it becomes racemic.

The examples in textbooks of secondary substrates going by the SN1 mechanism invariably involve the use of bromide (or other good nucleophile) as the leaving group have confused the understanding of alkyl nucleophilic substitution reactions at secondary carbons for 80 years[3]. Work with the 2-adamantyl system (SN2 not possible) by Schleyer and co-workers, the use of azide (an excellent nucleophile but very poor leaving group) by Weiner and Sneen, the development of sulfonate leaving groups (non-nucleophilic good leaving groups), and the demonstration of significant experimental problems in the initial claim of an SN1 mechanism in the solvolysis of optically active 2-bromooctane by Hughes et al.[3] have demonstrated conclusively that secondary substrates go exclusively (except in unusual but predictable cases) by the SN2 mechanism.

==E2 competition==
A common side reaction taking place with SN2 reactions is E2 elimination: the incoming anion can act as a base rather than as a nucleophile, abstracting a proton and leading to formation of the alkene. This pathway is favored with sterically hindered nucleophiles. Elimination reactions are usually favoured at elevated temperatures because of increased entropy. This effect can be demonstrated in the gas-phase reaction between a phenolate and a simple alkyl bromide taking place inside a mass spectrometer:

With ethyl bromide, the reaction product is predominantly the substitution product. As steric hindrance around the electrophilic center increases, as with isobutyl bromide, substitution is disfavored and elimination is the predominant reaction. Other factors favoring elimination are the strength of the base. With the less basic benzoate substrate, isopropyl bromide reacts with 55% substitution. In general, gas phase reactions and solution phase reactions of this type follow the same trends, even though in the first, solvent effects are eliminated.

==Roundabout mechanism==
A development attracting attention in 2008 concerns a SN2 roundabout mechanism observed in a gas-phase reaction between chloride ions and methyl iodide with a special technique called &quot;crossed molecular beam imaging&quot;. When the chloride ions have sufficient velocity, the initial collision of it with the methyl iodide molecule causes the methyl iodide to spin around once before the actual SN2 displacement mechanism takes place.
