<text>The Bavarian Forest ( or &quot;Bayerwald&quot; ; ) is a wooded, low-mountain region in Bavaria, Germany, that is about 100 kilometres long. It runs along the Czech border and is continued on the Czech side by the Bohemian Forest (Czech: &quot;Šumava&quot;). Most of the Bavarian Forest lies within the province of Lower Bavaria, but the northern part lies within the Upper Palatinate. In the south it reaches the border with Upper Austria.

Geologically and geomorphologically, the Bavarian Forest is part of the Bohemian Forest - the highest of the truncated highlands of the Bohemian Massif. The area along the Czech border has been designated as the Bavarian Forest National Park (240 km2), established in 1970 as the first national park in Germany. Another 3,008 km2 has been designated as the Bavarian Forest Nature Park, established 1967, and another 1,738 km2 as the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park, established in 1965. The Bavarian Forest is a remnant of the Hercynian Forest that stretched across southern Germania in Roman times. It is the largest protected forest area in central Europe.

The highest mountain in the region is the Großer Arber (&quot;Great Arber&quot;, 1,456 m). The main river is the Regen, which is formed by the confluence of the White and Black Regen and flows out of the mountains towards the city of Regensburg.

== Overview ==
Together with the adjacent Upper Palatine Forest on the far side of the Cham-Furth Depression, and the Neuburg Forest south of Passau, the Bavarian Forest forms the largest contiguous area of woodland in Bavaria and, together with the Bohemian Forest and the Sauwald (its southeastern continuation towards Upper Austria), it forms one of the largest contiguous forests in Europe.

The Bavarian Forest is drained mainly by the Regen and Ilz rivers into the Danube, a small catchment near the Czech Republic drains into the Elbe via the Moldau.

The highest mountains of the Bavarian Forest are the Great Arber at 1,456 m and the Great Rachel (1,453 m). In the eastern part of the mountains, Germany&#x27;s first national park, the Bavarian Forest National Park, was established in 1970. It was expanded in 1997 and, together with the Bohemian Forest National Park (&quot;Sumava&quot; National Park) in the Czech Republic, is one of the largest protected areas in Europe.

In older cartographic and lexical works, the term &quot;Bavarian Forest&quot; refers only to the mountainous region of the Danube Hills, also known as the Anterior Bavarian Forest (&quot;Vorderer Bayerischer Wald&quot;) or Vorderer Forest (&quot;Vorderer Wald&quot;), between the Danube and the Regen, which has its highest elevation in the Einödriegel. The &quot;High Forest&quot; or Hinterer Forest (&quot;Hinterer Bayerischer Wald&quot;) between the Regen and the Bohemian border, including the mountains of the Arber, Rachel and Lusen, used to be part of the Bohemian Forest. The linguistic usage of the German-Bavarian authorities, the impact of tourism, and the presence formerly of the Iron Curtain contributed to the fact that the term &quot;Bavarian Forest&quot; was increasingly extended to mean the entire low mountain region on the German side of the border between Bavaria and Bohemia. As a result of political developments after 1989, most recently the accession of the Czech Republic to the Schengen area, however, there is a discernible trend to see the low mountain range on the German-Czech border as a unit, especially in terms of tourism.

Tourism is important to the Bavarian Forest. Sharing the natural environment are walkers, the forestry industry and several ski resorts. Furthermore, the Bavarian Forest is known for its glassblowing in the area of Zwiesel and is also known in the field of geoscience as a result of the fundamental station of Wettzell at Bad Kötzting.

=== Geomorphology ===
The heart of the Bavarian Forest (in its broader sense) is divided into the Rear or High Bavarian Forest (&quot;Hinterer Bayerischer Wald&quot;) in the centre of the Bohemian Forest, the Regen valley and the Anterior Bavarian Forest (&quot;Vorderer Bayerischer Wald&quot;). In addition, there are the foothills of the two main ridges to the southeast and those of the Anterior Bavarian Forest to the northwest. Almost all of the crest-like mountain ridges run from northwest to southeast; apart from that the most important local landscapes are generally characterised by their natural regional and geomorphological nature:

==== High Bavarian Forest and Regen valley ====
The centre of the Bohemian Forest lies between Zwiesel in the west and Vimperk in the east. It is a low-relief plateau, which rises almost everywhere to above 1,000 m. Northwest, towards the Großer Falkenstein (1,315 m), the relief energy rises; on the far side of the Great Regen valley, this line continues, crest- or even arête-like into the Kunisch Mountains with the Seewand/Zwercheck. (up to 1,343 m) and Osser (up to 1,293 m), which are located directly on the German-Czech border. The lower-lying Fahrenberg (893 m) finally leads to the Hoher Bogen (up to 1,079 m) that descends into the Cham-Furth Depression.

However, the highest peaks of the low mountain range are found on a second ridgeline, southwest of the main ridge, and which also runs from northwest to southeast. The Arber (up to 1,456 m) is linked to the Seewand to the north by a mountain ridge; to the northwest the ridgeline crosses the Schwarzeck (1,236 m) and runs up to the Kaitersberg (1,133 m); the upper valley of the White Regen, the so-called Lamer Winkel, separates this ridge from that of the Kunisch Mountains. To the southeast of the Arber, this ridge is initially interrupted by the Zwiesel Basin, in which nestles the town of Zwiesel, but continues on the far side of the basin, with the Rachel (up to 1,453 m), the Lusen (1,373 m) and the Dreisesselberg (1,333 m), the other highest mountains of the Bavarian Forest and in the whole of the Bohemian Forest too. The crest continues beyond the borders of Bavaria, along the border between the Czech Republic and Austria, crossing the mountains of the Plöckenstein (1,379 m) and Hochficht (1,338 m).

The Zeller Valley (&quot;Zellertal&quot;), which stretches from Bad Kötzting via Bodenmais and northeast of Langdorf to Bettmannsäge and continues in relief terms as far as Spiegelau, separates a third, slightly lower ridgeline, which bounds the High Bavarian Forest to the southwest. Immediately to the southwest of this valley, the ridgeline runs from the &quot;Wurzer Spitz&quot; (817 m) via the Weigelsberg (898 m) and the &quot;Wolfgangriedel&quot; (876 m) to the Kronberg (984 m) and, behind the valley of the Black Regen, over the Eschenberg (1,043 m) to the &quot;Kreuzberg&quot; (788 m) at Oberkreuzberg.

To the southwest of this third ridge are the rolling hills or &quot;Hügelland&quot; of the Regen Depression borders. Many of the most important settlements of the inner Bavarian Forest such as Viechtach, Teisnach, Regen, Rinchnach and Kirchdorf im Wald are located here along the course of the Black Regen. The quartz lode known as the Pfahl runs roughly through the centre of the depression, following the main Hercynian direction.

==== Anterior Bavarian Forest or Danube Hills ====
To the south-west of the Regen depression is the Anterior Bavarian Forest (also called the Danube Hills), which is up to 1,121 m high. Its crest also runs roughly south-eastwards, but is clearly divided into individual ridges, each of which runs in a different direction.

In the far northwest are the Elisabethszell Mountains near the village of Elisabethszell, the line of which runs away to the southeast. At the Hadriwa they reach a height of 922 m. Immediately to the east are the Hirschenstein Mountains which are similarly oriented. Beginning at the &quot;Zeller Höhe&quot; (850 m), the northernmost mountain of the Anterior Bavarian Forest overall, this range climbs to 1,092 m) at the Hirschenstein. Southeast of the Hirschenstein lie the &quot;Vogelsangwald&quot; woods and the Vogelsang (1,022 m), which comprises only one ridge; it runs from north to south. On the northern extension of this ridge in the Regen valley lies the &quot;Hornbergwald&quot; forest, which reaches 844 m at the &quot;Abendberg&quot; and thus clearly towers above the floor of the basin.

Immediately east of the Vogelsang is the Grafling Saddle (&quot;Graflinger Paßsenke&quot;), which follows the valleys of the Kollbach and Teisnach rivers from Gotteszell in the north to Grafling in the south. It is the most prominent gap in the Anterior Bavarian Forest and is crossed by the Bundesstraße 11 which climbs up to a height of 583.7 m. Immediately to the east of the pass are the Riegel Mountains (&quot;Riegelbergen&quot;) with the Einödriegel (1,121 m) to the north and the Breitenauriegel (1,116 m) to the south of the highest point of the Anterior Bavarian Forest. South of it and separated by the state road, St 2135, is a chain of summits, the Hausstein Mountains (&quot;Haussteinberge&quot;) and &quot;Leopoldswald&quot;, running eastwards. The Hausstein reaches a height of 917 m, the Fürberg in the far east climbing to 880 m.

The most southerly mountain range, the &quot;Sonnenwald&quot;, is also a chain of individual peaks running from west to east; it is only connected to the Leopoldswald southwest of the Fürberg by a narrow ridge. In its western half, the Brotjacklriegel reaches 1,011 m, in the east the Aschenstein climbs to a height of 944 m. Even the mountains at the western and eastern ends of the mountain chain rise clearly above the 800 m line. To the south of the Brotjacklriegel, the isolated &quot;Stierberg&quot; (716 m), southwest of Zenting, bounds the Lallinger Winkel (see below) markedly in the east. It is usually considered part of the Passau Vorwald (see below).

==== Falkensteiner Vorwald ====
The westernmost part of the Bavarian Forest is the Falkensteiner Vorwald, which adjoins the Anterior Bavarian Forest. It has an unspectacular, humpy relief. Of the few mountains exceeding 700 m in height, the Gallner (709 m) is the most spectacular. It is located immediately west of the Elisabethszell mountains and is still marked by the relief of the Anterior Bavarian Forest. Even higher but clearly less prominent are an unnamed hill northwest of Zinzenzell at 720 m and a hill southeast of Wiesenfelden that reaches 740 m. In the south near the Danube, in the &quot;Waxenberger Forst&quot;, the Kobelberg reaches a height of 703 m.

Between Roding and Wiesent, the Falkensteiner Vorwald is divided centrally by a slight depression which follows the south-southwesterly course of the Regen near Roding. In the north it is used by Perlbach and in the south by the Wiesent. To the west of this depression, the Hadriwa is the highest point, reaching 677 m. All the mountains mentioned so far, except the Gallner, are situated around the market municipality of Falkenstein which gives its name to the forest-covered mountains.

The western part of the Vorwald transition in the south and on this side of the Regen into the Jurassic rocks of the Franconian Jura; Regenstauf being located at the boundary between the rock formations. Below Nittenau, the Regen breaks through the Vorwald impressively in a 90° bend and various smaller loops. The main summit in this high-relief part of the landscape, is the &quot;Jugendberg&quot; (611 m) immediately southwest of Nittenau, but more spectacular are the slopes of the 664 m high &quot;Gailenberg&quot; above the bend in the Regen. On the right-hand, western side of the Regen the &quot;Schwarzberg&quot; reaches at height of 538 m immediately east of Maxhütte-Haidhof.

In the north of the western part of the Falkensteiner Vorwald there is a second, somewhat less prominent Regen water gap : the Reichenbach Regen valley (&quot;Reichenbach Regental&quot;) which begins at the bend in the Regen below Roding, runs through Walderbach and ends directly below Reichenbach. By contrast, the wider Regen valley section between the two water gaps from Treidling to the town of Nittenau, as well as the Roding Regen valley, belong to the adjoining Upper Palatine Hills, while the valley section by Cham is part of the Cham-Furth Depression.

==== Southeastern Bavarian Forest ====
To the southeast and adjacent to the Regen Depression and Anterior Bavarian Forest is the &quot;Passauer Vorwald&quot; and, beyond it, the &quot;Abteiland&quot; (&quot;Abbey Land&quot;), which on average is only a little hillier than the Regen valley. In the north of the region are the towns of Grafenau and Freyung, to the south is the Neuburg Forest, south of the Danube between Vilshofen and Passau. In the east, roughly from Waldkirchen, the Abbey Country transitions into the Wegscheid Plateau, which flows seamlessly into the Mühlviertel region of Lower Austria. This reaches a height of 948 m in the &quot;Frauenwald&quot;. To the west the Passauer Vorwald, south of the High Bavarian Forest and opposite its northern and northeastern perimeter mountains, descends into the Lallinger Winkel (&quot;Deggendorfer Vorwald&quot;) around 400 metres lower.

=== Geological structure ===

The Bavarian Forest is continued, initially northwest, then northeast, by the Upper Palatine Forest, Fichtel Mountains, Ore Mountains and Sudetes. Geologically, as the southwestern edge of the Bohemian Massif, it is indistinguishable from the Bohemian Forest on the other side of the Czech border and from the Sauwald on Austrian soil. Together with the Upper Palatinate Forest it forms the main unit group known as the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest.

For the sake of simplicity, a distinction is not made between the Bohemian Forest (originally the Inner Bavarian Forest) and the Bavarian Forest. Instead, the common local name of &quot;Bavarian Forest&quot; is used for the entire area of the low mountain range on the German side, as the term &quot;Bohemian Forest&quot; has become synonymous with the areas in the Czech Republic. A distinction is only made between the Anterior Bavarian Forest and the High Bavarian Forest, with the lineament of the Bavarian Pfahl being regarded as the boundary line between them. In the north–south direction, a distinction is made between the Upper and Lower Forest.

The Bavarian Forest is the rump of a Palaeozoic mountain chain, whose bedrock is classified as Late Proterozoic to Silurian. After several phases of deformation and metamorphosis the mostly sedimentary, but also plutonic and volcanic, source rocks were metamorphosed over millions of years into the present-day gneisses. These gneisses were intruded by mighty granite rock especially in the Carboniferous and Early Permian. The Kunisch Mountains in the north are formed of schist, whilst the gabbro-amphibolite massif around Eschlkam and Neukirchen beim Heiligen Blut with the Hoher Bogen form the southernmost foothills.

An important line that divides the Bavarian Forest into two parts is the approximately 150-kilometre-long fault line of the Bavarian Pfahl. Originally created as a large-scale fault during the UpperDevonian to Upper Carboniferous, it was reactivated by fracture tectonics in the outgoing Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic to form a herringbone crack system (&quot;Fiederspaltensystem&quot;), which was filled with quartz by the penetration of hydrothermal solutions. Due to the strength of the rock, this quartz wall protrudes up to 30 metres above the surrounding area for long distances. North of the Pfahl is found mainly gneiss, south of it granite and migmatites tend to predominate.

Between Regensburg and Passau, there is a marked difference in height between the forested mountains to the northeast and the Danube plain (&quot;Gäuboden&quot;) to the southwest. This dividing line between the Tertiary Hill Country and the Bavarian Forest is marked by the Danube Edge Fault (&quot;Donaurandbruch&quot;), a geological disruption between the sunken crystalline basement, lying beneath the Tertiary and Quaternary deposits of the molasse basin, and the still visible part northwest of this line, which belongs to the Bavarian Forest.

Quite striking too, is the difference in height between the Danube Plain, 300 to 350 m, and the highest peaks of the Anterior Forest, such as the Einödriegel at 1,121 m}, a difference of 800 metres in height over only a few kilometres of horizontal distance. Due to the uplift of the Bavarian Forest, which also affected the Neuburg Forest and the Sauwald, there was an antecedent incision of the rivers Inn and Danube into this area of the crystalline basement which led to the formation of a narrow valley zone from Pleinting down the Danube into Austria and south of Passau, where the Inn has formed a deeply incised riverbed.

=== Ice-Age landforms ===
Whilst the Anterior Bavarian Forest only exceeds 1,000 m in a few places (for example, the Brotjacklriegel 1,016 m, Einödriegel 1,121 m, Breitenauriegel 1,114 m, Vogelsang 1,022 m, Hirschenstein 1,092 m and Pröller 1,048 m), most of the summit regions in the High Bavarian Forest are over 1300 up to 1,400 m (Plöckenstein 1,378 m, Dreisesselberg 1,333 m, Lusen 1,371 m, Großer Rachel 1,453 m, Kleiner Rachel 1,399 m, Kaitersberg 1,133 m, Großer Falkenstein 1,315 m, Großer Osser 1,293 m, Zwercheck 1,333 m, Großer Arber 1,456 m).

In particular, those regions of the High Bavarian Forest were covered by snow and ice fields during the Ice Age that also left their traces. Here, on the vast plateaux there were rather extensive firn fields rather than long glacial snouts. The thickness of the glacier ice at 1,050 m was about 125 metres. Where the glaciers made their way into the valley, one can still find glacial landforms such as cirques, caroids (&quot;Karoide&quot;) and cirque lakes (Großer Arbersee, Kleiner Arbersee, Rachelsee) as well as moraine banks.

The toe of the glacier, for example near the Grosser Arbersee, was located at a height of 850 metres, the snout of the northern glacier down to the small Arbersee at a height of about 830 metres. Accordingly, there was a considerable difference in height of more than 600 metres from the summit regions to the terminal moraines. Other glacial tongues flowed down from the Grosser Rachel. Here too, there are cirques and caroids, which suggest ice-age glaciation.

<text>The Bavarian Forest National Park () is a national park in the Eastern Bavarian Forest immediately on Germany&#x27;s border with the Czech Republic. It was founded on 7 October 1970 as the first national park in Germany. Since its expansion on 1 August 1997 it has covered an area of 24,250 hectares. Together with the neighbouring Czech Bohemian Forest the Bavarian Forest forms the largest contiguous area of forest in Central Europe.

== Description ==

Especially protected are the Norway spruce–dominated highland forests, mixed mountain forests of European silver fir, European beech and spruce trees and water meadow spruce woods in the valleys. Although a few remnants of ancient forest remain, the National Park area is still heavily influenced by the former forestry industry. Since nature is now left to take its course again, there is no human intervention when there are catastrophic events such as large scale bark beetle infestation. This resulted in the death of a portion of the high elevation forests in the 1990s and triggered controversial discussions amongst the residents of the National Park, which highlighted differing attitudes to the wilderness. As the result of a compromise, bark beetle is now fought in the buffer area.

The highest peaks in the National Park are the Großer Falkenstein (), the Lusen () and the Großer Rachel (). In addition to the forests, there are also ecologically valuable raised bogs with bog lakes such as the Latschensee and former high meadows, the so-called &quot;Schachten&quot;, which spread even further on the Czech side of the border in the Bohemian Forest.

With over 700,000 visitors per year, the National Park is an important economic factor in the economically underdeveloped region of the Bavarian Forest.

== Geography ==
The National Park runs along the main ridge of the Bavarian Forest from the Großer Falkenstein (1,305 m) in the northwest past the Großer Rachel (1,453 m) to the Lusen (1,373 m) in the southeast.

According to the classification of the major natural regions of Germany it is part of the Rear Bavarian Forest (&quot;Hinterer Bayerischer Wald&quot;) in the Upper Palatine-Bavarian Forest.

On the other side of the border in the Czech Republic, the Bavarian Forest National Park is bounded by the Šumava National Park which is 68,064 hectares in area.

The national park is located in the eastern part of Bavaria in the counties of Regen and Freyung-Grafenau along the border with the Czech Republic and covers an area of 24,250 hectares of forest covering the low mountain range of the Bavarian Forest. It borders on the municipalities of (from north to south): Bayerisch Eisenstein, Zwiesel, Lindberg, Frauenau, Spiegelau, Sankt Oswald-Riedlhütte, Neuschönau, Hohenau and Mauth. Parts of the National Park are located on the territory of the respective communities and parts also lie in unparished areas.

There are many enclaves in the national park, especially around the edges:
* Zwieslerwaldhaus at the foot of the Großer Falkenstein belongs to the municipality Lindberg.
* Schleicher and Kreuzstraßl belong to Lindberg.
* Neuhütte and Jägerfleck in Spiegelau
* Guglöd, belongs to St. Oswald-Riedlhütte
* Waldhäuser on the Lusen, is part of Neuschönau, the largest enclave in the national park
* Altschönau, is part of Neuschönau.
* Sagwasser-Säge and Weidhütte form a joint functional enclave belonging to Hohenau and which is joined to the rest of the country, but can only be accessed on a road passing through the national park.
* Glashütte is part of Hohenau.

In addition, there are several other enclaves that comprise just one or a few small plots. These numerous enclaves, especially in the &quot;Altgebiet&quot; make the border very long there, and the buffer zone, where bark beetle control is allowed, extends far into the interior of the park (see below for more details).
== Ecology ==
=== Mammals ===
The park is home to many rare mammals such as the Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;), wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;), beaver (&quot;Castor fiber&quot;), Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), western barbastelle (&quot;Barbastella barbastellus&quot;), Bechstein&#x27;s bat (&quot;Myotis bechsteini&quot;) and the greater mouse-eared bat (&quot;Myotis myotis&quot;). Also present are red deer, of which two-thirds of the population overwinter in an enclosure, in order to prevent excessive grazing to the land. Even moose have been recorded in the park, from a population in the Lipno Reservoir, Czech Republic.

Lynx were eradicated from the National Park in around 1850, but in the 1970s five to ten were released into the park, along with another 17 released in the Šumava national park a decade later. This resulted in an initially strong increase in the lynx population in the region, but between 1995 and 2008, the population decreased significantly. This was possibly due to the illegal killing of the animals on both the Czech and Bavarian sides. 
Brown bears are not found in the wild in the park.

In 2016, a pair of wolves was discovered in the park.

===Birds===

Many rarely seen species of birds are found in the national park. These include capercaillie, hazel grouse, peregrine falcon, European honey-buzzard, black stork and Eurasian pygmy owl.

===Insects===

In the national park over 1800 beetle species have currently been identified, including 14 ancient woodland specialist species. Very rare insect species such as &quot;Tragosoma depsarium&quot;, a longhorn beetle which can only be found in forests rich in dead wood.

===Plants===

Rare and endangered plant species which are found in the national park include the Hungarian gentian, Swertia perennis and the mosses Buxbaumia viridis and Dicranum viride.

<text>The Regen (; ) is a river in Bavaria, Germany, and for a short distance in the Czech Republic. It is a left tributary of the Danube, at Regensburg, Germany.

==Etymology==
The name in German evolved from the name in Latin, but its meaning is unknown. The Romans called the river variously (feminine gender), (masculine), and (neuter).

==Geography==
The source of its main headstream, the (&#x27;Great Regen&#x27;), is located in the Bohemian Forest on the southern slopes of Mt. Pancíř at above sea level, in the territory of Železná Ruda in the Czech Republic. The river crosses the Czech-German border after a few kilometres, at Bayerisch Eisenstein.

At Zwiesel, the Great Regen is joined by the (&#x27;Little Regen&#x27;) to form the (&#x27;Black Regen&#x27;). The Schwarzer Regen flows through Regen and Viechtach, and is joined by the (&#x27;White Regen&#x27;) in Bad Kötzting. Beyond this confluence, the river is called Regen. The river&#x27;s total length, including its headstreams, the Great Regen and Black Regen, is . The Kleiner Regen crosses the Frauenau Reservoir.

The Regen Valley forms the main valley crossing the Bavarian Forest; many settlements within the mountains are located along the river. Cities along the Regen river include Cham and Regensburg.

<text>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC; French: &quot;Chambre de commerce internationale&quot;) is the largest, most representative business organization in the world. ICC represents over 45 million businesses in over 170 countries who have interests spanning every sector of private enterprise.

ICC&#x27;s current chair is Philippe Varin and John W.H. Denton AO is the current Secretary General .

ICC has three main activities: rule setting, dispute resolution, and policy advocacy. Because its member companies and associations are themselves engaged in international business, ICC has unrivalled authority in making rules that govern the conduct of business across borders. Although these rules are voluntary, they are observed in thousands of transactions every day and have become part of international trade.

A world network of national committees in over 90 countries advocates business priorities at national and regional level. More than 5,000 experts drawn from ICC&#x27;s member companies feed their knowledge and experience into crafting the ICC stance on specific business issues through specialised ICC Policy Commissions.

ICC is the only business organisation to have Observer Status at the United Nations General Assembly, and is a representative voice for business at the World Trade Organization, and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional, such as G20 on behalf of international business. ICC was the first organization granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and UN Observer Status.

== History ==
The International Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1919 to serve world business by promoting trade and investment, open markets for goods and services, and the free flow of capital. Its international secretariat was established in Paris and its International Court of Arbitration in 1923. Its first chairman was French Minister of Finance Étienne Clémentel. 
== Membership ==
Membership is gained through affiliation with an ICC national committee or via direct application to the ICC International Secretariat.

== Governing bodies ==

===World Council===

ICC&#x27;s supreme governing body is the World Council, consisting of representatives of national committees. The World Council elects ICC&#x27;s highest officers, including the chair and the vice-chairs, each of whom serves a three-year term. The chair, Vice-chair and the Honorary Chair (the immediate past chair) provide the organization with high-level leadership.

===Executive board===
Strategic direction for ICC is provided by its executive board, consisting of up to 30 business leaders and ex-officio members. It is elected by the World Council on the recommendation of the Chairmanship. Meeting three times a year, the executive board oversees the establishment of ICC&#x27;s strategic priorities and the implementation of its policies.

===International Secretariat===
The ICC Global Headquarters, based in Paris, is the operational arm of ICC. It develops and carries out ICC&#x27;s work programme, feeding business views into intergovernmental organizations on issues that directly affect business operations. The International Secretariat is led by the Secretary General, who is appointed by the World Council.

===National committees===
In over 90 of the world&#x27;s nations, members have established formal ICC structures called national committees. In countries where there is no national committee, companies and organizations such as chambers of commerce and professional associations can become direct members.

===Finance Committee===
The Finance Committee advises the executive board on all financial matters. On behalf of the executive board, it prepares the budget and regularly reports to the board. It reviews the financial implications of ICC activities and supervises the flow of revenues and expenses of the organization.

== Dispute resolution services ==
ICC&#x27;s administered dispute resolution services help solve difficulties in international business. ICC Arbitration is a private procedure that leads to a binding and enforceable decision.

The International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce steers ICC Arbitration and has received over 28,000 cases since its inception in 1923. Over the past decade, the court&#x27;s workload has considerably expanded.

The court&#x27;s membership has also grown and covers 85 countries and territories. With representatives in North America, Latin and Central America, Africa and the Middle East and Asia, the ICC Court has significantly increased its training activities on all continents and in all major languages used in international trade.

ICC Dispute Resolution Services exist in many forms:
*Arbitration is a flexible and efficient dispute resolution procedure leading to binding and final decisions subject to enforcement worldwide.
*Mediation is a flexible technique, conducted privately and confidentially, in which a neutral facilitator helps parties to seek a negotiated settlement of their dispute.
*Dispute boards are independent bodies designed to help resolve disagreements arising during the course of a contract.
*Expertise is a way of finding the right person to make an independent assessment on any subject relevant to business operations.
*DOCDEX provides expert decisions to resolve disputes related to documentary credits, collections and demand guarantees, incorporating ICC banking rules.

Expedited or &#x27;fast-track&#x27; arbitration procedures automatically apply where disputes are worth US$2 million or less, if the arbitration agreement was made after 1 March 2017, unless the parties have specifically opted out of the expedited procedure in their agreement.

== Policy and business practices ==
ICC policies, rules and standards are prepared by specialized working bodies. Normal procedure requires policy statements first to be adopted by a commission, in consultation with national committees, and then approved by the executive board, before they can be regarded as official and public ICC positions.

Commissions examine major policy issues of interest to world business. Each national committee (NC) or group may appoint delegates to represent it at meetings. Officers are appointed by the chairman and Secretary General in consultation with NCs. Meetings of commissions are normally held twice a year.

Task forces are constituted under the various commissions for a limited period to undertake specific projects and report back to their parent commission. Some task forces may include representatives of more than one commission.

=== Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice ===
The ICC Code of Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice, underpins global advertising and marketing around the globe. This Code sets ethical standards and guidelines for businesses using today&#x27;s rapidly changing technology, tools and techniques to market products and services. Developed by experts from all sectors of industry and all regions of the world, the code&#x27;s purpose is to protect consumers by setting out guidelines for responsible marketing.

The Code is structured in two main sections—General Provisions and Chapters. The General Provisions section contains fundamental principles and other broad concepts that apply to all marketing in all media. Code Chapters are detailed and apply to specific marketing areas, including: Sales Promotion, Sponsorship, Direct Marketing, Digital Media and Environmental Marketing Claim.

== World Chambers Federation ==
In 1951, ICC established the World Chambers Federation (WCF), formerly the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. WCF is the unique global forum uniting the worldwide network of chambers of commerce and industry. It aims to connect and inspire chambers and facilitate the exchange of best practice and the development of new global products and services for chambers, and foster international partnerships between chambers and other stakeholders to help local businesses grow. WCF is a non-political, non-governmental body, with its membership comprising local, regional, national, bilateral and transnational chambers of commerce, as well as public-law and private-law chambers.

WCF was established by ICC and its chamber members following a resolution at the conclusion of the World Congress of Chambers of Commerce (Rome 1950). At its inaugural committee meeting held in Paris in December 1950, WCF was to be first known as the International Information Bureau of Chambers of Commerce. As its role expanded and grew during the 1960s, its name changed to become the International Bureau of Chambers of Commerce and by June 2001, it became known as the World Chambers Federation.

WCF also organizes the World Chambers Congress every two years in a different region of the world. The Congress is the only international forum for chamber leaders and professionals to share best practices, exchange insights, develop networks, address the latest business issues affecting their communities, and learn about new areas of innovation from chambers around the world.

During the Congress, WCF also announces the winners of World Chambers Competition , the only global awards program to recognize the most innovative projects undertaken by chambers of commerce and industry from around the world.

== Training and events ==
Staged all over the world, ICC events range from large topical conferences to training sessions for small groups. These smaller courses share ICC&#x27;s expertise on commercial arbitration and dispute resolution mechanisms as well as ICC&#x27;s trade tools including Incoterms rules, Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) and international contracts.

The ICC Academy is the training arm of the International Chamber of Commerce and delivers online certification and professional development services to meet the educational needs of banks, corporate and other organizations at the forefront of international trade. The specialized programs, e-courses and certifications are designed by the International Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s experts and practitioners.

== Publications ==
ICC Publications is the publishing arm of the International Chamber of Commerce providing business with essential resources in three broad categories: ICC rules and guidelines, practical commentaries, and reference works. The content of ICC&#x27;s publications is derived from the work of ICC commissions, institutions and individual international experts.

ICC publishes mainly for international lawyers, arbitrators, bankers, traders and students covering topics such as international banking, international trade reference and terms, law and arbitration, counterfeiting and fraud and model commercial contracts. The best-known publications, Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits and Incoterms, have been translated into more than 30 languages.

ICC offers its publications not only in the traditional paper format, but also in electronic format, eBooks, on the ICC Store.

== Commercial Crime Services ==

ICC Commercial Crime Services (CCS) provides the world business community with a centralized commercial crime-fighting body. It draws on the resources of its members in the fight against commercial crime on many fronts.

From its base in London, and comprising three distinct bureaux, CCS operates according to two basic principles: to prevent commercial crime and to investigate and help prosecute criminals involved in commercial crime.

The specialized divisions of CCS are:
*International Maritime Bureau
*Financial Investigation Bureau
*Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau
* FraudNet is a private organization of the ICC Commercial Crime Services, the anti-crime arm of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Membership is limited to the law firms that represent the victims of financial crimes, including fraud, and is by invitation only.

== Special projects and initiatives ==

===Business Action to Support the Information Society===

ICC set up BASIS (Business Action to Support the Information Society) in mid-2006 to speak out on a wide range of critical issues, including:
*Internet governance matters such as data protection, privacy, security, and the technical management and coordination of the Internet
*liberalization of the telecoms market
*entrepreneurship
*innovation
*ICTs as tools for development

===Commission on Anti-Corruption===
The ICC&#x27;s Rules of Conduct aim to &quot;place an efficient and well-run integrity programme&quot; to deal with corruption, extortion and bribery.

The ICC&#x27;s Commission on Anti-Corruption first published &quot;Fighting Corruption, A Corporate Practices Manual&quot; in 1999; the manual provides &quot;detailed practical guidance for compliance with the ICC Rules of Conduct and the OECD Convention&quot;. The rules take account of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption signed in Mérida, Mexico on 9 December 2003. There are nine rules of conduct for business &quot;of a general nature&quot;, to be accepted on a voluntary basis and applied through self-regulation within the context of the national laws on bribery which apply to each business. The ICC sees its role, and the function of its Commission on Anti-Corruption, to &quot;promote the widest possible use of the Rules&quot;.

===United Nations representation===

Since 1946, ICC has held top-level consultative status with the United Nations and a close working relationship with its specialized agencies. The current ICC Permanent Observer to the UN is Crispin Conroy. December 2016 the International Chamber of Commerce was granted Observer status by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the basis of General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/71/156) On 13 December 2016, ICC was granted Observer Status by 193 members of the UN General Assembly. ICC took up its position as Observer to the General Assembly on 1 January 2017.

<text>Brinkmanship or brinksmanship is the practice of trying to achieve an advantageous outcome by pushing dangerous events to the brink of active conflict. The maneuver of pushing a situation with the opponent to the brink succeeds by forcing the opponent to back down and make concessions rather than risk engaging in a conflict that would no longer be beneficial to either side. That might be achieved through diplomatic maneuvers, by creating the impression that one is willing to use extreme methods rather than concede. The tactic occurs in international politics, foreign policy, labor relations, contemporary military strategy (by involving the threat of nuclear weapons), terrorism, and high-stakes litigation. 

The term is chiefly associated with John Foster Dulles, US Secretary of State from 1953 to 1956 during the Eisenhower administration. Dulles sought to deter aggression by the Soviet Union by warning that the cost might be massive retaliation against Soviet targets.

==Origins==
Brinkmanship is the ostensible escalation of threats to achieve one&#x27;s aims. The word was probably coined, on the model of Stephen Potter&#x27;s &quot;gamesmanship&quot;, by the American politician Adlai Stevenson in his criticism of the philosophy described as &quot;going to the brink&quot; during an interview with US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles during the Eisenhower administration. In the article written in &quot;Life&quot; magazine by the correspondent James R. Shepley, Dulles defined his policy of brinkmanship in these terms: &quot;The ability to get to the verge without getting into the war is the necessary art.&quot; During the Cold War, it was used as a policy by the United States to coerce the Soviet Union into backing down militarily. Eventually, the threats involved might become so huge as to be unmanageable, at which point, both sides are likely to back down. That was the case during the Cold War, since the escalation of threats of nuclear war, if carried out, were likely to lead to mutual assured destruction (MAD).

The pioneering game theorist Thomas Schelling defined brinkmanship as &quot;manipulating the shared risk of war.&quot; The essence of such a crisis is that it leads neither side to be in full control of events, which creates a serious risk of miscalculation and escalation.

==Credible threats==
For brinkmanship to be effective, both sides continuously escalate their threats and actions. However, a threat is ineffective unless it is credible, and, at some point, an aggressive party may have to prove its commitment to action.

The chance of things sliding out of control is often used in itself as a tool of brinkmanship, because it can provide credibility to an otherwise incredible threat. During the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis was an example of opposing leaders, US President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, continually issuing warnings with increasing force about impending nuclear exchanges without necessarily validating their statements. Thomas Schelling called that &quot;the threat that leaves something to chance.&quot;

==Cold War==
Brinkmanship was an effective tactic during the Cold War because neither side of the conflict could contemplate mutual assured destruction in a nuclear war. The nuclear deterrence of both sides threatened massive destruction on each other. Ultimately, brinkmanship worsened the relationship between the Soviets and the Americans.

===Conceptualization===
In the spectrum of the Cold War, the concept of brinkmanship involved the West and the Soviet Union using tactics of fear and intimidation as strategies to make the opposing side back down. Each faction pushed dangerous situations to the brink, with the intention of making the other back down in matters of international politics and foreign policy and obtaining concessions. Nevertheless, in the Cold War both parties were confronted with devastating consequences since the threats of nuclear war were unmanageable in any situation.

By escalating threats of nuclear war and massive retaliation, both parties had to respond with more force. The principle of the tactic was that neither party would prefer to yield to the other, but one of them would simply have to yield, or the outcome would be the worst possible for both of them.

The problem, however, was that yielding would result in being labelled as the weaker side. During the Cold War, both the Soviets and the Americans had a reputation to uphold to their populations and also to their neighboring countries and allies.

That made brinkmanship utterly risky since if neither country budged, the only way to avoid mutually assured destruction was to compromise. The British philosopher, mathematician, and intellectual Bertrand Russell compared it to the game of chicken:
Since the nuclear stalemate became apparent, the governments of East and West have adopted the policy which Mr. Dulles calls &#x27;brinksmanship.&#x27; This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called &#x27;Chicken!&#x27;.
====Contextualization====
The Soviet Union and the West spent nearly 50 years on the brink of war. During conflicts like the Cuban Missile Crisis, tensions escalated to the point that it seemed as if the Cold War would turn into an actual nuclear war. Brinkmanship was one of the steps prior to the point that war would actually break out.

In a conflict between two nations that were so ideologically opposed, drastic policies such as brinkmanship seemed to be the only way to come to any sense of agreement. Both the Americans and the Soviets maintained strict policies not to respond immediately to military threats. However, by making the possibility of a war more and more likely, both nations were able to make significant progress in discussions and peace.

====Eisenhower&#x27;s &quot;New Look&quot; policy====
US President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s New Look Policy reverted to the older notion that the Soviet Union could be contained if Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was still assumed to be aiming at further expanding Soviet influence. The tactic was supposed to isolate the Soviet Union so that communism would not spread but would collapse in on itself.

To enforce the tactic, the Americans made alliances with many countries that were considered to be vulnerable to the Soviets&#x27; sphere of influence. The Soviets were now known to have nuclear weapons and so both superpowers were on a more even playing field. To combat this problem, Eisenhower threatened to use all of the American arsenal if the Soviets took offensive measures.

That was a bold move as it established the stakes to be extremely high, as the action could cause massive destruction for both sides. The threat caused an increase and a buildup of tension, with neither side wanting to pull the trigger on the other for fear of the other&#x27;s reaction.

====Kennedy&#x27;s flexible response====
Flexible response was a defense strategy executed by US President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Its aim was to address skepticism that the Kennedy administration held towards Eisenhower&#x27;s New Look: specifically its policy of massive retaliation. Flexible response required mutual deterrence at tactical, strategic, and conventional levels and bestowing upon the United States the ability to respond to aggression across the spectrum of symmetrical conventional warfare and nuclear warfare.

Flexible response required the continuous presence of substantial conventional forces. The forces were to serve both to deter and to fight limited wars. Kennedy hoped to deter all wars, regardless of their nature. Although Eisenhower and Dulles wanted to achieve goals similar to those of Kennedy, both were more concerned with cost. To avoid both escalation and humiliation, Kennedy highlighted the importance of adequate flexibility and disregarded cost. Prior to nuclear war, Kennedy wished to increase the range of available options. He also believed that the European allies should contribute more to their own defense. Fundamentally, the notion of flexible response was to &quot;increase the ability to confine the response to non-nuclear weapons.&quot;

===Practices and effects of Cold War===
====Korean War (1950–1953)====

The Korean War was a military conflict between South and North Korea that started on June 25, 1950. Although armed hostilities ended with the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, the ceasefire was not a treaty under international law and so a technical state of war remains. The United States led the UN coalition supporting South Korea, while the Soviet Union and People&#x27;s Republic of China supported North Korea. The Korean War was the first armed conflict and proxy war of the Cold War and escalated tensions between the West and the East. In September 1949, the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb, which made a limited war virtually impossible.

Fears of communism had risen after the Second Red Scare, led by Wisconsin US Senator Joseph McCarthy, indirectly calling for a policy to limit Communist Threat: NSC 68. In accordance with NSC 68, a report that stated that all communist activities were controlled by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, and it called for military and economic aid to any country deemed to be resisting Communist threats, the Americans sent troops to South Korea after it was invaded by the North on June 25, 1950. That contradicted the report, in that the United States was once again at war (the report stated that the United States should avoid war), but US President Harry S. Truman feared a domino effect and wanted to prevent the spread of communism: 
If we let Korea down, the Soviets will keep right on going and swallow up one piece of Asia after another... If we were to let Asia go, the Near East would collapse and no telling what would happen in Europe... Korea is like the Greece of the Far East. If we are tough enough now, if we stand up to them like we did in Greece three years ago, they won&#x27;t take any more steps.
The Soviets boycotted the UN Security Council because the Americans had refused the entry of the People&#x27;s Republic of China into the United Nations. The UN, supported by the United States, freely passed a resolution requesting military action against North Korea. Led by General Douglas MacArthur, the UN Forces arrived along with the US Forces on July 1, 1950. Truman believed that the North Korean atomic threat was &quot;a threat based on contingency planning to use the bomb, rather than the faux pas so many assume it to be&quot; and so did not use brinkmanship but also continuously opted for limited war. His beliefs in ceasefire and peacekeeping between the North and the South were cause for great conflict with MacArthur, who sought total war. MacArthur believed that the United States should take the opportunity to wipe out communism permanently before it grew stronger by using all of its weapons such as turning the war into nuclear war. MacArthur was dismissed as a result of his continuous defiance to Truman and other superiors on April 11, 1951, after he sent an ultimatum to the Chinese Army without consent of Truman.

As the historian Bruce Cumings noted, the Korean War heightened the Cold War and brought both nations closer to a nuclear war. The United States wanted to ensure that the United Nations would succeed, unlike the League of Nations, and wanted to show off its power to the world and to exhibit that it could still tame the communist threat, which was now also present in Asia. Similarly, the Soviet Union wanted to demonstrate its newly built military strength to the United States.

====Berlin Crisis====

Between 1950 and 1961, &quot;the refugee flow continued at a rate of 100,000 to 200,000 annually&quot; with people moving from the East to the West. The economic conditions were better in West Berlin than in East Berlin and so attracted more young workers.

Trying to find a way to stop the people from moving, East German President Walter Ulbricht pressured the Soviet Union to help with Berlin and emigration. Khrushchev wanted the Western Allies to leave Berlin or sign a separate peace treaty with East Germany. He feared that West Germany would economically and politically overwhelm East Germany and in turn undermine the Warsaw Pact, which the Soviet Union dominated.

On November 10, 1958, Khrushchev delivered a speech in which he demanded that the Western Powers pulled out of Western Berlin within six months. Furthermore, Khrushchev declared that East Germany was to take control of all communication lines and so West Berlin would be accessible only with East German permission. Interpreting Khrushchev&#x27;s speech as an ultimatum, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom declined and said that they would remain in West Berlin.

In 1959, the Big Four powers held a conference in Geneva in which the foreign ministers attempted to negotiate an agreement on Berlin. However, the conference did not do much other than open up talks between the Soviet Union and United States. The Soviets wanted Western powers out of West Berlin in an attempt to reunify Berlin. The United States refused to give up West Berlin. In 1961, Khrushchev met with Kennedy and they continued to solve the issue on Berlin. Again, Khrushchev sent an ultimatum to the United States, asking them to leave West Berlin. As a result, Kennedy increased military and defense expenditures.

On August 13, 1961, Ulbricht had ordered barbed wire between East and West Berlin. The barbed wire was later changed to cement walls. This prevented the movement between the two sides. The division between the two Berlins was known as the Berlin Wall. The United States heavily condemned the Berlin Wall and responded by placing troops on the West German side. The actions were followed by Soviet Union, which placed its troops and tanks on the East German side. That led to the iconic image of tanks facing each other at &quot;Checkpoint Charlie,&quot; which symbolized the division of the eastern and the western parts of Germany.

Any action taken by either side&#x27;s had the possibility of resulting in a nuclear war between the Soviets and the Americans. As a result, in the summer of 1961, Kennedy met with Khrushchev in Vienna to try to find a solution for the problem of Berlin. Kennedy suggested Khrushchev to remove the Soviet troops, and the American troops would then be removed. However, no solution was found since neither side was ready to make concessions. The conference ended with Khrushchev issuing another ultimatum to the United States that gave six months to get out of Berlin. As a result, Kennedy refused to back down and instead prepared for military action, which led to further military escalation by Khrushchev.

====Cuban Missile Crisis====

A prime example of brinkmanship during the Cold War was the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), a 13-day conflict between the United States, the Soviet Union, and Cuba. Both superpowers were armed with nuclear weapons and practiced brinkmanship during the conflict. The Cuban Missile Crisis was not only the closest that the Americans and the Soviets came to an armed conflict but also the &quot;closest the world has come to [a full-scale] nuclear war.&quot;

The crisis was caused by the placement of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba, an island that was within the US sphere of influence and launching distance. That was arguably an act of brinkmanship by the Soviets to intimidate the US with weapons within the region. The US responded to the presence of the weapons by blockading Cuba. The Cuban blockade was also an act of brinkmanship since the Americans, instead of succumbing to the pressure from the Soviets, decided to see how the Soviets would react to the Americans stopping their vessels from entering Cuba.

===Arms race===
The US was building up its missiles, with President Eisenhower issuing the National Defense Education Act in 1958, an attempt to close the missile gap with the Soviets. It gave funds to US. schools to start researching more so that the US military could catch up with the Soviet&#x27;s technology. Eisenhower also started NASA from NACA, several research laboratories, and parts of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency: see Creation of NASA.

===Aftermath of Cuban Missile Crisis===
====Détente====

The détente was essentially a stilling of the waters between the Americans and the Soviets. It was started by US President Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger. It continued until 1980 and the start of the second phase of the Cold War. It focused on a philosophical deepening of American foreign policy to adjust to the changing international order, as opposed to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, which had been too single-minded in their pursuit of victory in Vietnam. That move away from focusing solely on military buildup heralded 12 years in which the world experienced a kind of peace by the decreased tensions between the Americans and the Soviets.

====Ronald Reagan and end of the Cold War====
Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as US president on January 20, 1981. His idea of nuclear relations was, from the outset, very different from détente&#x27;s goal of stability. He effectively ended the previously-accepted agreement of mutually assured destruction by almost immediately increasing the pace of the buildup of American arms to an unprecedented rate. Besides the buildup of conventional arms, military technology was improved. With the introduction of the stealth bomber and neutron bomb, the US again began to pull away from the Soviet Union. The most pivotal of them was the Strategic Defense Initiative - later called &#x27;Star Wars&#x27; because of its improbability - which simultaneously brought the Americans to the brink of war against the Soviets, as the SDI nullified the idea of MAD, and also induced arms talks between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet leader.

==North Korean nuclear crisis==
The 2017–2018 North Korean nuclear crisis has been described as a representation of brinkmanship between US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The nuclear crisis was followed by a peace process, which saw mixed results.

<text>In genomics, DNA–DNA hybridization is a molecular biology technique that measures the degree of genetic similarity between DNA sequences. It is used to determine the genetic distance between two organisms and has been used extensively in phylogeny and taxonomy.

== Method ==
The DNA of one organism is labelled, then mixed with the unlabelled DNA to be compared against. The mixture is incubated to allow DNA strands to dissociate and then cooled to form renewed hybrid double-stranded DNA. Hybridized sequences with a high degree of similarity will bind more firmly, and require more energy to separate them. An example is they separate when heated at a higher temperature than dissimilar sequences, a process known as &quot;DNA melting&quot;.

To assess the melting profile of the hybridized DNA, the double-stranded DNA is bound to a column or filter and the mixture is heated in small steps. At each step, the column or filter is washed; then sequences that melt become single-stranded and wash off. The temperatures at which labelled DNA comes off reflects the amount of similarity between sequences (and the self-hybridization sample serves as a control). These results are combined to determine the degree of genetic similarity between organisms.

A method was introduced to hybridize a large number of DNA samples against numerous DNA probes on a single membrane. The samples would need to be separated into individual lanes within the membrane, which would then be rotated to allow simultaneous hybridization with multiple DNA probes.

==Uses==

When several species are compared, similarity values allow organisms to be arranged in a phylogenetic tree. It is therefore, one possible approach to carrying out molecular systematics.

===In microbiology===
DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) is used as a primary method to distinguish bacterial species as it is difficult to visually classify them accurately. This technique is not widely used on larger organisms where differences in species are easier to identify. In the late 1900s, strains were considered to belong to the same species if they had a DNA–DNA similarity value greater than 70% and their melting temperatures were within 5 °C of each other. In 2014, a threshold of 79% similarity has been suggested to separate bacterial subspecies.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1186/1944-3277-9-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

DDH is a common technique for bacteria, but it is labor intensive, error-prone, and technically challenging. In 2004, a new DDH technique was described. This technique utilized microplates and colorimetrically labelled DNA to decrease the time needed and increase the amount of samples that can be processed. This new DDH technique became the standard for bacterial taxonomy.

===In zoology===
Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist, pioneers of the technique, used DNA–DNA hybridization to examine the phylogenetic relationships of avians (the Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy) and primates.

=== In radioactivity ===
In 1969, one such method was performed by Mary Lou Pardue and Joseph G. Gall at the Yale University through radioactivity where it involved the hybridization of a radioactive test DNA in solution to the stationary DNA of a cytological preparation, which is identified as autoradiography.

== Replacement by genome sequencing ==

Critics argue that the technique is inaccurate for comparison of closely related species, as any attempt to measure differences between orthologous sequences between organisms is overwhelmed by the hybridization of paralogous sequences within an organism&#x27;s genome. DNA sequencing and computational comparisons of sequences is now generally the method for determining genetic distance, although the technique is still used in microbiology to help identify bacteria.

===&quot;In silico&quot; methods===
The modern approach is to carry out DNA–DNA hybridization &quot;in silico&quot; utilizes completely or partially sequenced genomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1186/1471-2105-14-60&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The GGDC and TYGS developed at DSMZ are the most accurate known tools for calculating DDH-analogous values. Among other algorithmic improvements, it solves the problem with paralogous sequences by carefully filtering them from the matches between the two genome sequences. The method has been used for resolving difficult taxa such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; group, and &quot;Aeromonas&quot;. The Judicial Commission of International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes has admitted dDDH as taxonomic evidence.

<doc id="241193" wikidata="Q1689431" url="?curid=241193" title="Jimmy Rushing">
<text>James Andrew Rushing (August 26, 1901 – June 8, 1972) was an American singer and pianist from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S., best known as the featured vocalist of Count Basie&#x27;s Orchestra from 1935 to 1948.

Rushing was known as &quot;Mr. Five by Five&quot; and was the subject of an eponymous 1942 popular song that was a hit for Harry James and others; the lyrics describe Rushing&#x27;s rotund build: &quot;he&#x27;s five feet tall and he&#x27;s five feet wide&quot;. He joined Walter Page&#x27;s Blue Devils in 1927 and then joined Bennie Moten&#x27;s band in 1929. He stayed with the successor Count Basie band when Moten died in 1935.

Rushing said that his first time singing in front of an audience was in 1924. He was playing piano at a club when the featured singer, Carlyn Williams, invited him to do a vocal. &quot;I got out there and broke it up. I was a singer from then on,&quot; he said.

Rushing was a powerful singer who had a range from baritone to tenor. He has sometimes been classified as a blues shouter. He could project his voice so that it soared over the horn and reed sections in a big-band setting. Basie claimed that Rushing &quot;never had an equal&quot; as a blues vocalist, though Rushing &quot;really thought of himself as a ballad singer.&quot; George Frazier, the author of &quot;Harvard Blues&quot;, called Rushing&#x27;s voice &quot;a magnificent gargle&quot;. Dave Brubeck defined Rushing&#x27;s status among blues singers as &quot;the daddy of them all.&quot; Late in his life, Rushing said of his singing style, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what kind of blues singer you&#x27;d call me. I just sing &#x27;em.&quot; Among his best-known recordings are &quot;Going to Chicago&quot;, with Basie, and &quot;Harvard Blues&quot;, with a saxophone solo by Don Byas.

==Early life and education==
Rushing was born into a family with musical talent and accomplishments. His father, Andrew Rushing, was a trumpeter, and his mother, Cora, and her brother were singers. He studied music theory with Zelia N. Breaux at Frederick A. Douglass High School in Oklahoma City and was unusual among his musical contemporaries for having attended college at Wilberforce University.

Rushing&#x27;s father encouraged him to play violin: &quot;He had bought me a violin, and he had forbidden me to touch the piano.&quot; But when his father &quot;left the house, he&#x27;d lock the piano and give my mother the key. We&#x27;d watch him go away, and then she&#x27;d give me the key.&quot; 

Rushing was inspired to pursue music and sing blues by his uncle Wesley Manning and George &quot;Fathead&quot; Thomas of McKinney&#x27;s Cotton Pickers. 

==Career==
Rushing toured the Midwest and California as an itinerant blues singer in the early 1920s before moving to Los Angeles, where he played piano and sang with Jelly Roll Morton. He also sang with Billy King before moving on to Walter Page&#x27;s Blue Devils in 1927. He and other members of the Blue Devils defected to the Bennie Moten band in 1929.

Moten died in 1935, and Rushing joined Count Basie for what would be a 13-year job. Due to his tutelage under his mentor Moten, Rushing was a proponent of the Kansas City, Missouri, jump blues tradition exemplified by his performances of &quot;Sent for You Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot; for the Count Basie Orchestra. After leaving Basie, his recording career continued as a singer with other bands.

When the Basie band broke up in 1950, he retired briefly but then formed his own group. He made a guest appearance with Duke Ellington for the 1959 album &quot;Jazz Party&quot;. In 1960, he recorded an album with the Dave Brubeck Quartet.

He appeared in the 1957 television special &quot;Sound of Jazz&quot;, singing one of his signature songs, &quot;I Left My Baby&quot;, backed by many of his former Basie band members. In 1958, he was among the musicians included in an &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine photo by Art Kane that was memorialized in the documentary film &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;. He toured the UK with Humphrey Lyttelton and his band. A BBC broadcast with Rushing accompanied by Lyttelton&#x27;s big band was released in 2009. In 1960, he appeared in a videotaped blues jam at the Newport Jazz Festival with the Muddy Waters Blues Band, singing &quot;Mean Mistreater&quot;. In 1969, Rushing appeared in &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;, the first major studio feature film directed by an African-American, Gordon Parks.

==Death==
Rushing died of leukemia on June 8, 1972, at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York City, and was buried at the Maple Grove Cemetery in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York. 

Until weeks before his death, he was singing on weekends at the Half Note Club in Manhattan. 

==Personal life==
Rushing was married twice. He had two sons, Robert and William, with his second wife, Cornelia (usually known as Connie), to whom he was married from the 1940s until his death. Connie Rushing is credited with two compositions on his 1968 solo album &quot;Livin&#x27; the Blues&quot;. 

He lived in Jamaica, Queens.

==Critical assessment==
Rushing was held in high critical esteem during his career and after his death. Whitney Balliett, jazz critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote of Rushing that, &quot;His supple, rich voice and his elegant accent have the curious effect of making the typical roughhouse blues lyric seem like a song by Noël Coward&quot;. The critic Nat Hentoff, who ranked Rushing as one of the &quot;greatest blues singers,&quot; credited him as a seminal influence in the development of post–World War II popular black music. Hentoff wrote that rhythm and blues &quot;has its roots in the blues shouting of Jimmy Rushing...and in the equally stentorian delivery of Joe Turner...&quot; Scott Yanow described Rushing as the &quot;perfect big band singer&quot; who &quot;was famous for his ability to sing blues, but in reality he could sing almost anything.&quot; In an essay about his fellow Oklahoman, the writer Ralph Ellison wrote that it was &quot;when Jimmy&#x27;s voice began to soar with the spirit of the blues that the dancers – and the musicians – achieve that feeling of communion which was true meaning of the public jazz dance.&quot; Ellison said Rushing began as a singer of ballads, &quot;bringing to them a sincerity and a feeling for dramatizing the lyrics in the musical phrase which charged the banal lines with the mysterious potentiality of meaning which haunts the blues.&quot; In contrast with Rushing&#x27;s reputation, he &quot;seldom comes across as a blues &#x27;shouter,&#x27; but maintains the lyricism which has always been his way with the blues,&quot; wrote Ellison. According to Gary Giddins, Rushing &quot;brought operatic fervor to the blues,&quot; and of his time with Count Basie notes that &quot;just about every record they made together is a classic.&quot;

He was a four-time winner of Best Male Singer in the Critics&#x27; Poll of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and a four-time winner of Best Male Singer in the International Critics&#x27; Poll in &quot;Down Beat&quot;. His 1971 album &quot;The You and Me That Used to Be&quot; was named Jazz Album of the Year by &quot;Down Beat&quot;, and he received the 1971 Grammy nomination Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist.

Rushing was one of eight jazz and blues legends honored in a set of United States Postal Service stamps issued in 1994.

He was a 2024 inductee to the Blues Foundation&#x27;s Blues Hall of Fame.

<doc id="241204" wikidata="Q48191" url="?curid=241204" title="Requiem shark">
<text>Requiem sharks are sharks of the family Carcharhinidae in the order Carcharhiniformes. They are migratory, live-bearing sharks of warm seas (sometimes of brackish or fresh water) and include such species as the bull shark, lemon shark, blacktip shark, and whitetip reef shark.

Family members have the usual carcharhiniform characteristics. Their eyes are round, and one or two gill slits fall over the pectoral fin base. Most species are viviparous, the young being born fully developed. They vary widely in size, from as small as adult length in the Australian sharpnose shark, up to adult length in the oceanic whitetip shark. Scientists assume that the size and shape of their pectoral fins have the right dimensions to minimize transport cost. Requiem sharks tend to live in more tropical areas, but tend to migrate. Females release a chemical in the ocean in order to let the males know they are ready to mate. Typical mating time for these sharks is around spring to autumn.

According to the ISAF, requiem sharks are among the top five species involved in shark attacks on humans; however, &quot;requiem shark&quot; is not a single species, but refers, in this case, to an order of similar sharks that are often involved in incidents. ISAF prefers to use &quot;requiem sharks&quot; due to the difficulty in identifying individual species.

==Etymology==
The common name requiem shark may be related to the French word for shark, &quot;requin&quot;, which is itself of disputed etymology. One derivation of the latter is from Latin &quot;requiem&quot; (&quot;rest&quot;), which would thereby create a cyclic etymology (&quot;requiem-requin-requiem&quot;), but other sources derive it from the Old French verb &quot;reschignier&quot; (&quot;to grimace while baring teeth&quot;).

The scientific name Carcharhinidae was first proposed in 1896 by D.S. Jordan and B.W. Evermann as a subfamily of Galeidae (now replaced by &quot;Carcharhinidae&quot;). The term is derived from Greek (&quot;karcharos&quot;, sharp or jagged), and ῥί̄νη (&quot;rhinē&quot;, rasp); both elements describe the jagged, rasp-like skin. Rasp-like skin is typical of shark skin in general, and is not diagnostic to Carcharhinidae.

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest member of the family is &quot;Archaeogaleus lengadocensis&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Valanginian) of France. Only a handful of records of the group are known from prior to the beginning of the Cenozoic. Modern carcharinid sharks have extensively diversified in coral reef habitats.

== Hunting strategies ==
Requiem sharks are extraordinarily fast and effective hunters. Their elongated, torpedo-shaped bodies make them quick and agile swimmers, so they can easily attack any prey. Some species are continually active, while others are capable of resting motionless for extended periods on the bottom. They have a range of food sources depending on location and species, including bony fish, squid, octopus, lobster, turtles, marine mammals, seabirds, other sharks and rays; smaller species tend to select a narrow range of prey, but some very large species, especially the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), are virtually omnivorous. They are often considered the &quot;garbage cans&quot; of the seas because they will eat almost anything, even non-food items like trash. They are migratory hunters that follow their food source across entire oceans. They tend to be most active at night time, where their impressive eyesight can help them sneak up on unsuspecting prey. It is worth mentioning that the tiger shark, however, possibly belongs to the Galeocerdidae family. Most requiem sharks hunt alone, however some species like the whitetip reef sharks and lemon sharks are cooperative feeders and will hunt in packs through coordinated, timed attacks against their prey. Some of the species have been shown to give specialized displays when confronted by divers or other sharks, which may be indicative of aggressive or defensive threat.

<text>Galeocerdo is a genus of ground shark. Only a single species, &quot;G. cuvier&quot;, the tiger shark, is extant. The earliest fossils date back to the early Eocene epoch, (Ypresian), around 56–47.8 Million years ago. While historically considered a member of the requiem shark family Carcharhinidae, it is currently considered to be the only member of the family Galeocerdonidae. While this genus was historically considered diverse, including 21 extinct species, morphometric analysis conducted in 2021 suggested that the diversity of the genus included only 5 extinct species (including the Eocene †&quot;G. clarkensis&quot; and †&quot;G. eaglesomei&quot;, Oligocene-late Miocene †&quot;G. aduncus&quot;, Miocene †&quot;G. mayumbensis&quot;, and Pliocene †&quot;G. capellinii&quot;) much lower than previously assumed. The oldest fossils of the extant &quot;G. cuvier&quot; date to the middle Miocene.

<text>The Abbey Church of the Holy Cross (commonly known as Shrewsbury Abbey) is an ancient foundation in Shrewsbury, the county town of Shropshire, England.

The Abbey was founded in 1083 as a Benedictine monastery by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery. It grew to be one of the most important and influential abbeys in England, and an important centre of pilgrimage. Although much of the Abbey was destroyed in the 16th century, the nave survived as a parish church, and today serves as the mother church for the Parish of Holy Cross.

The Abbey is a Grade I listed building and is a member of the Greater Churches Group. It is located to the east of Shrewsbury town centre, near the English Bridge, and is surrounded by a triangular area which is today referred to as Abbey Foregate.

==History==
===Foundation===
Before the Norman Conquest of England, a small Saxon chapel dedicated to St Peter stood outside the east gate of Shrewsbury; it had been built by Siward, son of Ethelgar and a close relative of Edward the Confessor. There was still a landowner, known as Siward the Fat, in Shropshire in the Domesday Book of 1086, although he had owned many more estates in 1066. He must have been the donor of the two estates the church is known from Domesday to have held in 1066: at Boreton near Condover and Lowe near Farley. However, the Abbey had lost Lowe by 1087.

When Roger de Montgomery received Shropshire from William the Conqueror in 1071, he gave the church to one of his clerks, Odelerius of Orléans, the father of the historian Orderic Vitalis, who is the main source for the foundation of the Abbey and probably an eye-witness. Orderic stresses his father&#x27;s role in persuading Earl Roger to commit himself to building a monastery and stresses that Odelerius from the outset wanted it to be Benedictine. The specific purpose was to benefit Earl Roger&#x27;s soul. 

On 25 February 1083 Earl Roger summoned his senior officials, including Warin, the Sheriff of Shropshire and Picot de Say, and publicly pledged himself to found a new Abbey, laying his gloves on the altar of St. Peter and granting the whole suburb outside the east gate for the construction. Reginald and Frodo, two monks from the great Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Martin-de-Séez in Southern Normandy, formed the nucleus of the new community, and began to plan and build the monks&#x27; lodging, working with Ordelerius and Warin. The Domesday Book found the abbey under construction: &quot;In the City of SHREWSBURY Earl Roger is building an Abbey and has given to it the monastery of St Peter where the parish (church?) of the City was.&quot; This suggests that Siward&#x27;s foundation was already a monastery before Earl Roger began building but it is fairly certain there was no more than a wooden parish church.

When sufficiently complete (probably late in 1087), regular life began under the first abbot, Fulchred of Sées. The Abbey of Saint-Martin-de-Sées was closely associated with Shrewsbury in the early years because Earl Roger was its founder and he and the House of Bellême, into which he had married, were also major benefactors there, as were Roger&#x27;s knights. A notification lodged at Sées in 1086 by Robert of Bellême, Roger&#x27;s son, who was later to become 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, shows that they used the monks as witnesses in their property deals and custodians of the documents. About the time he recruited Abbot Fulchred or Foucher, Earl Roger made a huge grant of estates in England to Sées, for the soul of recently deceased William the Conqueror, as well as of Queen Matilda and of Roger himself and his dead wife Mabel de Bellême. Some of these were estates he had originally intended for Mabel. It seems that Sées Abbey for a time harboured plans to claim jurisdiction over Shrewsbury and it also contested some properties granted by Earl Roger; however, Shrewsbury became independent.

Once it was safely under the leadership of Fulchred, Ordelirius placed Benedict, one of his sons, in Shrewsbury Abbey as an oblate, with a gift of 200 silver livres. Both Ordelirius himself and Earl Roger met their deaths as monks of the Abbey.

===Difficulties and insecurity===
Earl Roger and his associates added several estates and other sources of income to Shrewsbury Abbey&#x27;s endowment, which had been valued at £46 18s. in 1086, before the first abbot was appointed. As well as rural manors, the abbey had urban property, mills, and the tithes and advowsons of many churches. However, Orderic, a shrewd observer, tells us that Roger only &quot;moderately endowed with lands and rents&quot; (&quot;terris ac redditibus mediocriter locupletavit&quot;). Moreover, there was a long wait ahead before some of the endowments were to materialise.

The abbey&#x27;s modest but sufficient wealth was threatened, before many of the grants were confirmed by royal charter, when Earl Roger&#x27;s son, Robert of Bellême, revolted against Henry I in 1102. The king exiled and expropriated his unruly vassal and the patronage of the abbey escheated to the Crown. This deprived the abbey of powerful local protection and gave the descendants and successors of donors an opportunity to wriggle out of their obligations. For example, Siward had given up any claims he might have to the abbey site in return for a life-time grant from Earl Roger of the estate of &quot;Langafeld&quot;, now Cheney Longville, which would pass to the abbey on his death. Siward&#x27;s son, Aldred, refused to surrender the estate to the abbey until Abbot Fulchred gave him £15. This arrangement was engineered by Richard de Belmeis I, later Bishop of London, whom the king had sent to exercise viceregal powers in Shropshire after Earl Robert&#x27;s expropriation. However, Richard was not to be trusted. On his death bed in 1127 he admitted to his confessors that he had lied about his tenure of Betton in Berrington, which really belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey – probably a grant from Robert de Limesey, then Bishop of Chester His confessor tried to clear up the matter by stating the facts to the interested parties. Although Richard had directed that the estate be restored to Shrewsbury Abbey, its status was contested by his lay successors for decades. In 1127 Philip de Belmeis sued for the estate, although he quickly defaulted. His younger son, Ranulph, tried again a few decades later, but gave up in return for acceptance into the abbey&#x27;s lay fraternity. As late as 1212 Roger de la Zouche launched a fresh suit, in which he persisted for years, unsuccessfully. These were only examples of a morass of complex litigation into which the abbey was drawn.

However, Henry I himself seems to have been supportive of Shrewsbury Abbey, especially when in the vicinity. He confirmed Robert&#x27;s gift of land Baschurch to Fulchred, perhaps while actually campaigning against Robert in Shropshire and Staffordshire. He also took Fulchred&#x27;s side in a variety of disputes with officials of the royal forests in Shropshire and reminded local officials and barons that the abbey was exempt from all customs, as in the time of Earl Roger.

After this initial support, however, there was a long delay before the king took further action on the monastery&#x27;s behalf. It is unclear when Abbot Fulchred died, but it was certainly some years before 1121, when Henry at last came to the support of Godfrey, the second abbot, with a series of charters. Some of these, at least, were issued within Shropshire: at Bridgnorth, Condover and Shrewsbury itself. These included a general statement of principle that the new abbot was to enjoy the same estates and privileges as his predecessor. Note was taken that the abbey had exchanged Henry de Say&#x27;s manor of Brompton, south of Shrewsbury, for Siward&#x27;s former estate of Cheney Longville in an attempt to improve management and economise by concentrating resources. Two documents announced and confirmed Henry&#x27;s own valuable gift of multure or mill-right to the abbey within Shrewsbury. As the monks were to receive the miller&#x27;s fee for all grain ground in the town, they had a monopoly over milling, and no-one else was allowed to grind corn without their permission. As it was related to the water power of the Severn and its tributaries, the king attached to the grant a monopoly over fisheries at both of the town&#x27;s bridges. The newly appointed Bishop of Hereford, the ambitious royal administrator Richard de Capella, whose diocese included a large part of southern Shropshire, was specifically warned not to let the king hear of any complaints against himself in relation to the Abbey.

=== Robert of Shrewsbury and the translation of St Winifred ===
In 1137/38 Robert of Shrewsbury, who was prior under the third and fourth abbots, Herbert and Ralph, negotiated and carried out the translation of the remains of St Winifred from Gwytherin in Wales. Robert is thought to have been a member of the Pennant family of Downing, a few miles north-west of Holywell, the main shrine and fountain of Saint Winifred. He wrote a life of the saint shortly after the translation, adding an account of his mission to Wales, which is the main source of information about the events. The body was disinterred and borne ceremoniously to Shrewsbury, a week&#x27;s journey on foot and thus encumbered. There it was laid in the church of St Giles to await the blessing of the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Overnight a youth was enabled to walk again by the presence of the reliquary. It was taken in procession into the town. The expectation of an episcopal blessing ensured it was witnessed by &quot;an incredible concourse of devout people&quot; as it was taken to be placed on the altar of the Abbey church, where further miracles were reported. The relics were later enshrined in the abbey.

Robert is generally accepted as responsible for strengthening the cult of Winifred, who had hitherto been an obscure Welsh saint, so that she became the focus of pilgrimages from Shrewsbury and other centres from the 14th century to the present. Later he became the fifth abbot and, although little is known of his abbacy, he seems to have been zealous in pursuing the abbey&#x27;s interests against local rivals. He was successful in recovering two portions of the tithes of Emstrey parish church which had been granted &quot;against conscience and the consent of his convent&quot; by Abbot Ralph to the church at Atcham. Emstrey was a large parish, which stretched from the western bank of the River Severn opposite Atcham to the Abbey Foregate. The Abbey cartulary contains an instrument by which the Archbishop, Theobald of Bec, orders Bishop Walter to restore the tithes to the abbey. The underlying rivalry was not between the Shrewsbury Abbey and the little church of St Eata, but between the Shrewsbury and its Augustinian rival, Lilleshall Abbey which was tightening its grip on Atcham manor and parish, apparently to expand it across the Severn. Its ownership of the ferry crossing at Atcham was an important source of income for Lilleshall. It had recently acquired the advowson of Atcham church, and was later allowed to appropriate the church by Thomas Becket. By the beginning of the Plantagenet era Shrewsbury Abbey faced considerable competition for resources from major monasteries in the vicinity. As well as Lilleshall, technically a royal foundation, but effectively the creation of the brothers Philip and Richard de Belmeis II, there was Haughmond Abbey, another large Augustinian house closely connected with the FitzAlan family, and Buildwas Abbey, a large Cistercian house that received gifts from many of the local nobility, including the Belmeis and FitzAlans.

The quest for relics seems to have played an important part in the abbey&#x27;s effort to maintain itself in the face of such competition. Abbot Adam, Robert&#x27;s successor, is known to have visited Canterbury, probably with this aim, and it was probably he who brought back an entire rochet that had belonged to Becket, part of another which was stained with the blood of his martyrdom, another cloth stained with his blood and brains, and various items of his clothing, including his hair shirt, collar, girdle, cowl, shirt and glove. A document prepared in the reign of Henry II lists these relics along with those of many other saints. Second only to the relics of Winifred were those of St Elerius, St Winifred&#x27;s spiritual director, then wrongly considered the author of a life of Winifred that is now thought to date from about 1100.

===Monastic life and management===
The Benedictine Rule was not austere in comparison with the discipline of the Cistercians and Augustinians, and Shrewsbury Abbey was markedly less isolated than its competitors, located as it was in the suburbs of a major town. Because of good management, the abbey did not get into serious difficulties in the 12th century, despite the underlying problems with many of its endowments. Even in the early 12th century the abbey owned a number of properties in and around the town: orchards, a vineyard and a sand-pit. In the 13th century the integration with Shrewsbury became closer still, as the abbey expanded its holdings of urban property in the Abbey Foregate, the market, and elsewhere in the town. The great majority of the rural holdings were let to small farmers or cultivated as demesne lands; only rarely did the community let entire manors to laymen, and it was reluctant to tolerate leases of more than one lifetime. The demesnes were managed by lay bailiffs and stewards on behalf of the abbey; there is no evidence that the monks themselves ever cultivated the land.

Within the bounds of this fairly comfortable provision, monastic discipline was apparently quite good. In 1323-4 Bishop Roger Northburgh, recently appointed and at war with much of the ecclesiastical establishment in his diocese, instigated a series of canonical visitations that took in all of the abbeys and smaller houses around Shrewsbury. While criticisms were, in many cases, severe, Shrewsbury&#x27;s shortcomings were fairly minor or very general: too many monks were missing meals in the refectory, novices were allowed out before they had properly learnt the Rule, and the accounts of the obedientiaries, the abbot&#x27;s under-managers, were inadequate – this last a complaint made of nearly all religious houses in the diocese. Thirty years later, in the wake of the Black Death, Northburgh found buildings on many manors were in poor repair, but this was a sign of the times, not the fault of the monks.

In the later Middle Ages the number of monks ranged from 12 to 18. Generally one was away, heading Morville Priory, a dependent monastic cell between Bridgnorth and Much Wenlock. In addition to the canonical hours there was regular celebration of Mass in the growing number of chantries and other chapels. The chapel of St Mary, behind the High Altar, contained the tomb of Earl Roger and was endowed well from the early 13th century. A monk was appointed as its warden and it was initially used to celebrate Mass for visiting dignitaries. In 1343-4 a chantry was established there for the soul of Ralph of Shrewsbury, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, funded from the revenues of Boreton. Another chantry was endowed for John Burley in 1414, and shortly afterwards Henry V decided to establish a chantry in honour of St Winifred but, this had to wait until much later.

The abbey made some effort to develop its monks intellectually, as well as spiritually. In 1333, on the request of Edward III and Queen Philippa, the Pope allowed it to takeover the tithes of Wrockwardine parish church and devote them to the education in theology of two monks at a university, although the quota was later reduced to a single monk.

===Abbots===
The monarch was patron of the abbey, but there is no record of whether 12th-century monarchs actually played any part in the installation of Shrewsbury&#x27;s abbots. Confusion has surrounded the election of Herbert, the third abbot. Orderic wrote that: &quot;Herbertus gubernaculum rudis abbatiae usurpavit.&quot; This has been translated to as stating that Herbert &quot;usurped the rudder of the infant establishment&quot; or that he simply &quot;took the government of this rising community.&quot; He was consecrated by Archbishop William de Corbeil but later removed by a legatine council and replaced by Ralph or Ranulf. In 1250, during the reign of Henry III, there was a major dispute over the succession in which the local candidate, the sacrist Adam, was rejected by the bishop, who appointed William the sub-prior of Coventry. Both were set aside by the Pope, who provided instead Henry, a monk from Evesham Abbey. A month after his appointment Henry was also granted the privilege of wearing the pontifical ring. The king had played no independent part in the drama: nevertheless the Benedictine chronicler of Tewkesbury Abbey accused him of intruding William into Shrewsbury Abbey. Thereafter, abbots were invariably elected from within the monastic community.

The abbots became increasingly important political figures. Since the confiscation of Earl Robert&#x27;s lands by the Crown, each Abbot of Shrewsbury was a tenant-in-chief, and with the summoning of Parliament in the reign of Henry III, compelled to attend. Abbot Luke bought a house in London to make it easier for himself and his successors to attend Parliament and perform other important political business. This was a good buy, as when the number of abbots summoned to parliament was fixed at 28 during the reign of Edward III, the Abbot of Shrewsbury was one of them. The Victoria County History asserts that the abbots were permitted by the Pope to wear the mitre from 1397. Abbot Richard Lye actually died in London while on parliamentary business in 1512 and was buried at St Bartholomew-the-Less in Smithfield.

===Endowments===
The abbey&#x27;s lands and other income sources were found all over Shropshire, although sparse in the south-west, where Earl Roger had less power and influence. As well as landed estates, there were a number of lucrative churches, salt pans and fisheries. After the first spate of donations there was a tendency for endowments to become more scattered, with grants in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Cheshire and even Cambridgeshire. It was impossible to dispose legally of mortmain properties, as they were inherently inalienable: Church property could be lost only if there was doubt about its status. Billingsley was given up to Sées Abbey in exchange for recognition of Shrewsbury&#x27;s rights in Lancashire. Part of Betton was surrendered to Hamo Lestrange, and is still known as Betton Strange. In 1286 Edward I ordered the surrender of lands at Mere in Staffordshire, a royal grant to the abbey, which Abbot Drayton had given away to William de Merton.

===Late Middle Ages: crises, opportunities and felonies===
The economic crisis of the early 14th century hit monasteries hard and Shrewsbury was no exception. One response was to evade the risks of demesne farming in favour of the secure income stream from leases: the Shropshire demesnes seem to have been contracted from 21 carucates in 1291 to 12 in 1355. There were other consolidations. Abbot Adam of Cleobury in 1344 traded the abbey&#x27;s right to cut timber in the king&#x27;s woods across the county, which was often hard to exploit because of poor communications, for 240 acres of nearby Lythwood, although the exchange cost £100 at the time and an annual rent of £3. The Black Death brought a much worse crisis. Repeated outbreaks of the plague reduced the labour force so that in 1354 Bishop Northburgh blamed the scarcity of labour for the disrepair of many buildings, although he warned the abbey to look after its investment in Lythwood. The next abbot, Henry of Alston, died after a short period of office and soon there were not even enough priests. In 1365 Abbot Nicholas Stevens and the prior of Coventry were each granted a faculty by the Pope to ordain ten to make up the numbers. Stevens seems to have been a fairly effective leader in consolidating the abbey&#x27;s position.
During the 14th century considerable rebuilding took place at the west end of the Abbey. A sketch of the great west window made in 1658 by Francis Sandford shows a selection of coats of arms that seem to suggest it was glazed around 1388, in the time of Stevens, who may also have been responsible for some of the other 14th century alterations. He was on good terms with the king, Richard II, who attributed his grant of a charter in 1389 not only to his own devotion to St Winifred, but also &quot;the sincere affection we bear and have to Nicholas the abbot, and for his merits.&quot;

This may help account for the abbey&#x27;s relative impunity under Stevens, who sought, through a protracted series of manoeuvres, to annex Sandwell Priory, near West Bromwich in Staffordshire, to Shrewsbury Abbey. In so doing he got away with near-murder. Initially he encouraged one Richard Tudenham to contest the position of the elected prior, John de Kyngeston. In 1370 Kyngeston took legal action against Stevens after suffering an arrow wound in the arm during an attack by five men. In 1379 Stevens, together with two monks and a secular cleric, abducted Kyngeston and held him at a house in Sleap, north of Shrewsbury, until he signed a resignation. Bishop Robert de Stretton installed as prior of Sandwell one of the Shrewsbury monks involved in the abduction, Brother Richard Westbury. However, the conspirators fell out over the spoils, with Tudenham challenging Westbury&#x27;s appointment. On Westbury&#x27;s death in 1397, a successor installed by Bishop Richard le Scrope was driven out by an armed gang. Stevens seems largely to have escaped censure for his role in the affair. There can be little doubt, however, of his determination to protect and extend the interests of his abbey. It was apparently under Stevens that a party of Shrewsbury monks stole the relics of St Beuno, St Winifred&#x27;s uncle and confessor, from Rhewl and installed them in the abbey church. Although the abbey was fined, it was allowed to keep the relics. It was also under Stevens that a new shrine was built for St Winifred herself.
Thomas Prestbury clearly had very different relations with Richard II and was committed to the custody of the Abbot of Westminster in April 1399. He was elected Abbot of Shrewsbury in August, after the king had been imprisoned by Henry IV, which suggests he was suspected of Lancastrian sympathies. His efforts to mediate before the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 were in vain but he brought great prestige to the abbey as Chancellor of Oxford University. However, even he seems to have lived under the cloud of an accusation of felony.
The veneration of Winifred and the associated cults of Beuno and Elerius seems to have been of increasing importance throughout this period. It was in the time of Stevens or Prestbury that John Mirk, Prior of Lilleshall, composed his sermon for St Winifred&#x27;s day, part of his much-copied and later printed &quot;Festial&quot;. The chronicler Adam of Usk, after recording the death and burial of Owain Glyndŵr, noted that: &quot;The king, with great reverence, went on foot in pilgrimage from Shrewsbury to St Winifred&#x27;s well in North Wales.&quot; This journey is not recorded elsewhere but seems to have been in about 1416, and was probably the occasion of Henry V&#x27;s proposal to install a chantry in honour of the saint at Shrewsbury. Nothing further was done until 1463, when Abbot Thomas Mynde was allowed by the Pope, in response to a letter from his predecessor Abbot Ludlow, to earmark the tithes of Great Ness for the project, with the proviso that enough remain to support a vicar in the parish. By the time the permission arrived, the Yorkists were dominant and it was not until 1487 that Mynde was able to mobilise resources for the purpose. In line with the late medieval trend towards mobilising lay initiative for such work, he set up a guild of men and women to service the chantry. Two years earlier Margaret Beaufort, Henry VII&#x27;s mother, had rebuilt the shrine at Holywell; William Caxton had printed a translation of Robert of Shrewsbury&#x27;s life of Winifred. Despite this late flowering of piety and pilgrimage, however, the abbey was entering on difficult times.

===Decline and dissolution===

Evidence from the reign of King Henry VIII seems to show the abbey suffering from neglect and maladministration in its later years. Abbot Richard Lye lavished the resources of the monastery on his own family. On 25 October 1508 he granted to his sister Joan and her husband, John Copeland, a large weekly ration of bread and ale, twelve wagonloads of wood annually from Lythwood, and tithes of corn and hay from the townships of Prescott and Stanwardine in the Wood in Baschurch parish. They also received property: a dwelling house and a shop in Shrewsbury, and meadowland and another home in Colneham. It seems that this generosity with others&#x27; property had gone on for some time, as they were also given the reversion of further meadowland then occupied by Joan and the abbot&#x27;s father, Lodovic Lye. The gifts were limited to Joan&#x27;s lifetime, apart from the shop and houses, which were to pass to her husband for his lifetime if he survived her. Episcopal visitations from the time of Abbot Richard Baker complain of unpaid debts, poor accounting, buildings in decay and land leased without consulting the chapter. This apparently refers to the grants to Joan and John Copeland, which had been made nominally on behalf of abbot and convent together. The infirmary was in ruins and Thomas Butler, the subprior, had taken its glass for his own chamber.

Initially prompted by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning a series of events known as the English Reformation. In the same year there was a Visitation of the Monasteries, ostensibly to examine their character, but in fact to value their assets with a view to expropriation. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, however, was an entirely candid valuation of the income of the monasteries. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, allied to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Shrewsbury Abbey&#x27;s income was assessed by the Valor at precisely £527 15s. 5d. Of this, £414 1s. 3d. was contributed by the temporalities; essentially, property rents drawn from estates in 26 manors of Shropshire and seven in other counties.

Thomas Cromwell began the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, with the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act affecting the smaller houses valued at less than £200 a year. This released a torrent of criticism of the larger monasteries that, like Shrewsbury, were comfortably above the threshold. The governance of Thomas Butler, now abbot, was subjected to a litany of complaint to the government by Thomas Maddockes, a London merchant tailor. Much was familiar: the infirmary was no more, numerous parts of the building were in disrepair, and accounting was slack. However, there were instances too of funds being misdirected: the Wrockwardine tithes were no longer funding studies at Oxford, and those of Great Ness did not find their way to Henry V&#x27;s chantry. Even income intended to buy books for the choir was misappropriated. Boteler was criticised personally for high-handedness and factionalism. More generally, Madockes alleged that the word of God was never preached there since he was abbot.&quot;
In 1539 Cromwell moved to the dissolution of the larger monasteries which had escaped earlier, Shrewsbury among them. Henry VIII personally devised a plan to form at least thirteen new dioceses so that most counties had a cathedral (a former monastery). This plan included making Shrewsbury Abbey a cathedral, but, while new dioceses were established at Bristol, Gloucester, Oxford, Peterborough, Westminster and Chester, the plans were never completed at Shrewsbury, Leicester, or Waltham. The 1539 legislation did not dissolve the greater abbeys, but only made arrangements for receiving on the king&#x27;s behalf any &quot;which hereafter shall happen to be dissolved, suppressed, renounced, relinquished, forfeited, given up, or by any other means come to King&#x27;s Highness.&quot; Shrewsbury was one of the last to surrender, not because it put up any resistance, but because it lay at the end of the commissioners&#x27; circuit. Thomas Legh, one of the six clerks in chancery, officiated as the other commissioners demanded and received the surrender. The Abbey was dissolved on 24 January 1540, with a pension of £80 assigned to the abbot and £87 6s. 8d. to the 17 monks.

===Post-Reformation===
The abbey site and surrounding land seem to have been rented to Thomas Forster of Evelith, Shifnal, and his wife, Elizabeth, and it was they who had to account to the Exchequer for the abbey temporalities around 1542. However, on 22 July 1546 the lands and site were sold to two property speculators, Edward Watson of Northampton and Henry Herdson, a London skinner. They had only a pecuniary interest in the abbey site and sold it the following day to William Langley, a Shrewsbury tailor. After five generations, the last of the Langley line left it in 1701 to Edward Baldwin, a Middle Temple lawyer. As he died without issue, it was passed via his sister to the Powys family.

The western part of the Abbey (nave, side aisles, porch and west tower) was preserved as a parish church and the remaining buildings were either re-used or demolished. The building suffered severely from neglect after the Reformation. The lead from the roof was removed, leading to decay and eventual collapse. The Norman clerestory was still in existence in the 17th century but it was later taken down and the roof was rebuilt immediately above the triforium. Considerable portions of the monastic buildings were still standing in 1743 but most have since been demolished, particularly when Thomas Telford built his A5 road through the Abbey grounds c.1836, removing much of the remaining evidence of the monastic layout. The old refectory pulpit is still visible across the road from the church and a single wall of an Abbey building, now an integral part of another building, remains. In the late 19th century the possibility of the Abbey becoming a cathedral, for a Shropshire-wide diocese, was again considered, but legislation to that effect, drafted in 1922, was defeated by one vote in the House of Lords in 1926.

===Holy Cross Church===

The abbey&#x27;s church had always doubled as the church for the Abbey Foregate parish, as it owed its origins to the church, founded by Siward the Fat. It was a vicarage controlled by the abbey community. Its title varied slightly through time. One William, is known to have served as &quot;clericus de Cruce&quot;, clerk of the Cross, in the early 13th century. Around mid-century, Henry was the vicar of the altar of the Holy Cross. A late medieval reference in the records of the Diocese of Hereford calls it &quot;Vicaria altaris Sancte Crucis, ecclesia paochialis de Foriete Monachorum&quot;: Vicarage of the altar of Holy Cross, parish church of the Monk&#x27;s Foregate. From the brief reign of Edward V (1483) comes a document that appends &quot;Sancti Egidii&quot; or Saint Giles&#x27; to the name of the parish.

The parish had its own bailiffs, burgesses and seal, distinct from those of Shrewsbury itself. However, Shrewsbury&#x27;s renewed municipal charter of 1586 brought Holy Cross parish under its civic authority. Until the Dissolution, the right to present to the vicarage, or advowson, belonged to the Abbot and convent of Shrewsbury Abbey. Then it passed to the Crown. However, in 1797, legislation was passed to transfer the advowson to Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick of Attingham Park, in exchange for the patronage of some parishes he held in Suffolk.

The vicarage was fairly generously endowed with land and other income sources under an agreement made apparently by Abbot John Drayton in the 13th century. After the Dissolution of the Abbey, the parish church continued to be housed in the remains of the abbey church.

The church seems to have been damaged as a result of measures taken to fortify Shrewsbury after the Parliamentarians took the town in 1645. On 2 December 1646 the Parliamentarian County Committee instigated a survey and set aside timber for repairs. In 1649 the churchwardens paid Thomas Landford £10 1s. to repair breaches on the north side and east end, using stones from the old abbey buildings, and were able to offset against this 3s. they made by selling materials recovered from the damaged part of the church. In this period the church was generally called Abbey Foregate Church, as Puritans rejected the veneration of saints and relics. Under the ultimately abortive proposals for a Presbyterian polity in Shropshire, dated 29 April 1647, Abbey Foregate parish was part of the county&#x27;s first classis, along with most of the churches in Shrewsbury and the surrounding area. However, the minister was not appointed an elder of the classis and the parishioners remained uncooperative with Puritan church governance even after the collapse of the Presbyterian scheme.

* William Hordley, 1530–58.

=====Post-Reformation=====
* Edmund Bennett, 24 May 1559 – 1610, also served as curate of Ballidon chapel in Derbyshire, 1561.
* Francis Gibbons, 16 February 1611 – 7 January 1640. Grandson of William Langley, he became a D.D. and chaplain to Charles I. He oversaw the installation of an altar rail at Holy Cross in 1635, a clear sign of Laudian sympathies. His brother, Richard Gibbons, was elected as one of the bailiffs in 1628 and was a leader of the High Church opposition on the corporation to the Puritans around William Rowley.
* James Logan, instituted 4 May 1640, resigned 1663. However, he seems to have been ejected in February 1645, when Parliamentarian forces took Shrewsbury.

=====Commonwealth and Protectorate=====
* Joshua Richardson, 1645–6, an Oxford graduate from Broughton, near Myddle, was installed by the new Parliamentarian regime. He soon left to become Rector of Myddle.
* John Beale, c. 1647–8.
* Moses Leigh, c. 1649-50
* John Bryan, c. 1650–59. A noted Puritan preacher and son of another, John Bryan of Coventry. The corporation had tried unsuccessfully to recruit the elder Bryan for St Mary&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury and the younger&#x27;s installation at Holy Cross seems to have been seen as a compensation. He found the congregation intractably conservative and for a time could not administer the Lord&#x27;s Supper because they refused to elect elders. Under advice from Richard Baxter, he investigated a move to St Julian&#x27;s before moving to Chad church in Shrewsbury to replace Thomas Paget.
* Moses Leigh again, appointed by Richard Cromwell, under letters patent dated 3 May 1659.

=====Post-Restoration=====
* James Logan returned to office at Restoration, 1660. Resigned 1663.
* Timothy Hammond, July 1663. Buried 2 May 1671. CCEd currently has no records of him beyond 1665.
* Moses Leigh again, according to Owen and Blakeway, after he was put out of Norton in Hales in the Great Ejection of 1662 but later conformed. This third incumbency is not currently mentioned in CCEd, which has a lacuna.
* Samuel Pearson, 1676–1727. He was ordained a priest on 7 October 1676 and was made vicar of Holy Cross only two days later. He seems to have been popular in the parish, as attested in address from the parishioners to the bishop after his death on 16 November 1727.
* John Latham, 1727–50. Instituted on 28 November 1627, he quickly offended parishioners by proposing to remove a painting of the Crucifixion installed, according to the protesters, in the chancel by Pearson, although there is actually no chancel in the church. Bishop Chandler supported him and the painting was removed.
* William Gorsuch, 1750–82. Gorsuch was so meticulous in keeping records of births and deaths in the parish that his data was vital to the work of Richard Price, an important figure in the development of actuarial science.
* William Oakeley, 1782–1803. Oakeley was already rector of Eaton-under-Heywood and of Forton, Staffordshire when appointed to Holy Cross. In 1782 he became domestic chaplain to Bishop Cornwallis, who granted him special dispensation before instituting him vicar of Holy Cross. He did, however, resign the living at Eaton in 1786.
*Henry Lingen Burton, 1804–31, the first to be presented by Lord Berwick, also held at least two other livings while at Holy Cross: Atcham and Madeley, Shropshire.

====Notable later vicars====
*William Henry Draper (hymnwriter) - Vicar 1889-99
*Christopher Sidney Sims - Vicar 2002–2009, later Archdeacon of Walsall

====Notable curates====
*Walsham How - later Bishop of Wakefield and hymnwriter - Curate 1848-51

===Present-day church===
Much of the original Norman 11th-century building survives in the present Abbey church, notably the short thick piers in the eastern half of the nave and the remnants of the original transepts. Stones with three sculptured figures, representing John the Baptist, Saint Winefride and St. Beuno, were found in a garden and have been restored to their original position in the screen. During the 19th century there were major restoration projects to restore the clerestory, and the east end of the church was redesigned by John Loughborough Pearson to contain a chancel and sanctuary. When the restoration work of 1886-1894 was dedicated in May 1894, the then Vicar, Rev William Henry Draper, wrote a hymn to mark the occasion, &quot;In Our Day of Thanksgiving&quot; (titled &quot;Remembrance of Past Worshippers&quot;). 

Inside the west end, on opposite walls, are stone war memorial tablets to parishioners who died serving in the separate World Wars. One name on the tablet for the First World War is war poet Wilfred Owen (as Lieutenant W.E.S. Owen M.C., Manchester Regiment). In the Abbey churchyard is a memorial sculpture entitled &quot;Symmetry&quot; and erected by the Wilfred Owen Association on his birth centenary (1993) by Paul de Monchaux, incorporating a line from Owen&#x27;s poem &quot;Strange Meeting&quot; inscribed by Paul&#x27;s wife, Ruth.

In recent times, the area surrounding the Abbey has been prone to flooding.

==Bells==
At the Dissolution, the Abbey had two rings of five bells, one in the current tower and one in a central tower. In 1673, a ring of eight was cast by George Oldfield of Nottingham and these were replaced over time by the present bells. Nine peals were rung at the Abbey in the eighteenth century. The bells were rung full-circle until at least 1895, but in 1909 concern over the safety of the tower led to the bells being removed and rehung without wheels in a new frame. They are currently sounded by an Ellacombe apparatus, whereby they can be rung by a single person.

==Music==
===Choirs===
The Abbey has a long-standing reputation for excellence in liturgical music. Records from the mid-19th century show the existence of a choir of boys and men, which was maintained until after the Second World War. The current choir consists of a mixed adult choir which sings the majority of services. The choir also has choral scholars. The choir regularly visits cathedrals to sing services in the absence of the cathedral choir.

===Organ===
The Abbey has a fine organ, built in 1911 by William Hill and Son. It was designed to be on the scale of a cathedral organ, but lack of funds meant the original scheme was not completed. Some stops were subsequently added but without completing Hill&#x27;s original specification. Nevertheless, the quality of the Hill organ and the richness of its Edwardian tone still shone through, and the organ was a wonderful and fitting complement to the beauty of this ancient Abbey church. 

The console was also in original condition and was unusual for the right side positioning of the swell pedals, and for the sight of stop stubs (7) for the &quot;missing&quot; ranks. With the passage of time, the pneumatics became increasingly unreliable and there were also problems with the wind systems. 

A scheme for the organ&#x27;s renovation and completion was launched in 2011 to appeal for the necessary £400,000 for the scheme to start. That appeal was unsuccessful, but replacement of the original blower did greatly improved both the tone and the reliability of the organ. 

After years of fund raising, and many discussions of many different possibilities, a scheme to renovate and complete the organ was finally agreed by the PCC, and work began in March 2020, immediately before the first period of COVID lockdown. Work continued through to the summer of 2021, and an opening recital on the newly renovated and completed organ was given in October of that year.

The organ builder for the scheme was GO Organbuilders, assisted by a number of other specialists. The scheme of work involved replacing all the original tubular pneumatic actions with electric pneumatics, cleaning the whole instrument and all its pipework, restoring the choir organ expression box to its original size, lifting reservoirs and blowers to a higher position creating much needed vestry space, adapting and replacing all the wind trunking, and completing Hill&#x27;s original specification with limited, in-keeping additions. The Abbey was grateful to the Rector and Churchwardens of St Bartholomew the Great, London for their generous donation of much of the added pipework and chests. The original Hill console was also restored, and electrified, and the two expression box pedals centred. The whole project cost £234,000, funded by donations received over a long period of time, and crucially from generous grants from various Trusts. The completed Hill organ is now capable of filling the large Abbey space with glorious sound, and has the flexibility needed to accompany the choir, lead congregational singing and be used for teaching and for organ recitals.

The specification of the organ is available on the [National Pipe Organ Register https://npor.org.uk/survey/K01657] and on the Abbey&#x27;s web site. A booklet &quot;The organs of Shrewsbury Abbey is available in the Abbey, price £5

==Cadfael==

Shrewsbury Abbey is the setting for &quot;The Cadfael Chronicles&quot; by Ellis Peters, in which the fictional Brother Cadfael is embroiled in a series of historical murder mysteries. The character of Cadfael is a Welsh Benedictine monk living at the Abbey in the first half of the 12th century. The historically accurate stories are set between about 1135 and about 1145, during The Anarchy, the destructive contest for the crown of England between King Stephen and Empress Maud.

==Burials==
===Burials at the Abbey===
*Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury
*Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury
*William FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry

===The churchyard===
Most of the present churchyard covers the site of the east end of the monastic church. It was created as the town&#x27;s first public cemetery, having been bought by a group of gentlemen to avoid the ground being sold in individual plots. This was incorporated by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1840 and consecrated in 1841, but was commercially unsuccessful; 148 burials took place between the latter year and 1888, when it was sold back to the Abbey Church. The municipal General Cemetery at Longden Road (opened 1856) overtook the Abbey Cemetery in public usage.

<doc id="241211" wikidata="Q2090855" url="?curid=241211" title="Constitutional Act 1791">
<text>The Constitutional Act 1791 () was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain which was passed during the reign of George III. The act divided the old Province of Quebec into Lower Canada and Upper Canada, each with its own parliament and government. It repealed the &quot;Quebec Act 1774&quot;. The act remained in force until 1841, when it was largely repealed by the &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot;, which reunited the two provinces into the new Province of Canada. Some provisions relating to the clergy reserves remained in force. The remaining provisions of the act were repealed over time, with final repeal in 1966.

==History==

The act reformed the government of the Province of Quebec (1763–1791) to accommodate, amongst other Loyalists, the 10,000 United Empire Loyalists who had arrived from the United States following the American Revolution. The Province of Quebec, with a population of 145,000 French-speaking &quot;Canadiens&quot;, was divided in two when the act took effect on 26 December 1791. The largely unpopulated western half became Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) and the eastern half became Lower Canada (now southern Quebec). The names Upper and Lower Canada were given according to their location along the St. Lawrence River. Upper Canada received English law and institutions, while Lower Canada retained French civil law and institutions, including feudal land tenure and the privileges accorded to the Roman Catholic Church.

The legislative Council for the Affairs of the Province of Quebec, with its subset Executive Council cabinet, was continued and reinforced by the establishment of freeholder-elected legislative assemblies. These elected assemblies led to a form of representative government in both colonies; the Province of Quebec had not previously had a legislative assembly.

The &quot;Constitutional Act&quot; attempted to create an established church by forming the clergy reserves, that is, grants of land reserved for the support of the (Protestant) Church of England. Income from the lease or sale of these reserves, which constituted one-seventh of the territory of Upper and Lower Canada, from 1791 went exclusively to the Church of England and, from 1824 on in a complex ratio, the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. These reserves created many difficulties in later years, making economic development difficult and creating resentment against the Anglican church, the Family Compact, and the Château Clique, although it did eventually lead to the growth of an Ottawa neighbourhood known as The Glebe. The act was problematic for both English and French speakers; the French Canadians and the Roman Catholic church in Quebec felt they might be overshadowed by Loyalist settlements and increased rights for Protestants, while the new English-speaking settlers felt the French still had too much power. However, both groups preferred the act and the institutions it created to the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; which it replaced.

The act is often seen as a watershed in the development of French Canadian nationalism as it provided for a province (Lower Canada) which the French considered to be their own, separate from English-speaking Upper Canada. The disjuncture between this French-Canadian ideal of Lower Canada as a distinct, national homeland and the reality of continued Anglo-Canadian political and economic dominance of the province after 1791 led to discontent and a desire for reform among intellectual segments of the French and English of Lower Canada. The frustration of French and English Patriots over the nature of Lower Canadian political and economic life in the province fuelled the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–38.

== Subsequent legislative history and repeal ==
Most of the &quot;Constitutional Act, 1791&quot; was repealed by the &quot;Union Act, 1840&quot;, which merged Lower Canada and Upper Canada into the new Province of Canada. The provisions which were not repealed at that time mainly related to the clergy reserves. The remaining provisions were amended from time to time, and the act was finally repealed for the purposes of British law in 1966. 

The act did not originally have a short title, but by custom, it became known as the &quot;Constitutional Act, 1791&quot; in Canada. The British Parliament gave it a short title in 1896: &quot;Clergy Endowments (Canada) Act 1791&quot;. This title was based on the fact that the provisions relating to clergy endowments were the only part of the act still in force at that time. The short title is not the common name of the act in Canada. The federal government, the Supreme Court of Canada and academics continue to refer to it as the &quot;Constitutional Act, 1791&quot;.

<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 190, nicknamed Würger (Shrike) is a German single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft designed by Kurt Tank at Focke-Wulf in the late 1930s and widely used during World War II. Along with its well-known counterpart, the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Fw 190 became the backbone of the (Fighter Force) of the . The twin-row BMW 801 radial engine that powered most operational versions enabled the Fw 190 to lift larger loads than the Bf 109, allowing its use as a day fighter, fighter-bomber, ground-attack aircraft and to a lesser degree, night fighter.

The Fw 190A started flying operationally over France in August 1941 and quickly proved superior in all but turn radius to the Spitfire Mk. V, the main front-line fighter of the Royal Air Force (RAF), particularly at low and medium altitudes. The 190 maintained its superiority over Allied fighters until the introduction of the improved Spitfire Mk. IX. In November/December 1942, the Fw 190 made its air combat debut on the Eastern Front, finding much success in fighter wings and specialised ground attack units ( – Battle Wings or Strike Wings) from October 1943.

The Fw 190A series&#x27; performance decreased at high altitudes (usually 6,000 m [20,000 ft] and above), which reduced its effectiveness as a high-altitude interceptor. From the Fw 190&#x27;s inception, there had been ongoing efforts to address this with a turbosupercharged BMW 801 in the B model, the much longer-nosed C model with efforts to also turbocharge its chosen Daimler-Benz DB 603 inverted V12 powerplant, and the similarly long-nosed D model with the Junkers Jumo 213. Problems with the turbocharger installations on the -B and -C subtypes meant only the D model entered service in September 1944. These high-altitude developments eventually led to the Focke-Wulf Ta 152, which was capable of extreme speeds at medium to high altitudes (755 km/h [408 kn; 469 mph] at 13,500 m [44,300 ft]). While these &quot;long nose&quot; 190 variants and the Ta 152 derivative especially gave the Germans parity with Allied opponents, they arrived too late to affect the outcome of the war.

The Fw 190 was well-liked by its pilots. Some of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s most successful fighter aces claimed many of their kills while flying it, including Otto Kittel, Walter Nowotny and Erich Rudorffer. The Fw 190 had greater firepower than the Bf 109 and, at low to medium altitude, superior manoeuvrability, in the opinion of German pilots who flew both fighters. It was regarded as one of the best fighter planes of World War II.

==Early development==

===Genesis===
Between 1934 and 1935 the German Ministry of Aviation (RLM) ran a contest to produce a modern fighter for the rearming Luftwaffe. Kurt Tank entered the parasol-winged Fw 159 into the contest, against the Arado Ar 80, Heinkel He 112 and Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Fw 159 was hopelessly outclassed and was soon eliminated from the competition along with the Ar 80. The He 112 and Bf 109 were generally similar in design but the 109&#x27;s lightweight construction gave it a performance edge the 112 was never able to match. On March 12, 1936, the 109 was declared the winner.

Even before the Bf 109 had entered squadron service, in autumn 1937 the RLM sent out a new tender asking various designers for a new fighter to fight alongside the Bf 109, as Walter Günther had done with Heinkel&#x27;s follow-on to the unsuccessful He 100 and He 112. Although the Bf 109 was an extremely competitive fighter, the Ministry was worried that future foreign designs might outclass it, and wanted to have new aircraft under development to meet these possible challenges. Tank responded with a number of designs, most powered by a liquid-cooled inline engine.

However, it was not until a design was presented using the air-cooled, 14-cylinder BMW 139 radial engine that the Ministry of Aviation&#x27;s interest was aroused. As this design used a radial engine, it would not compete with the inline-powered Bf 109 for engines, when there were already too few Daimler-Benz DB 601s to go around. This was not the case for competing designs like the Heinkel He 100 or twin-engined Focke-Wulf Fw 187, where production would compete with the 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 for engine supplies. After the war, Tank denied a rumour that he had to &quot;fight a battle&quot; with the Ministry to convince them of the radial engine&#x27;s merits.

===Design concepts===
At the time, the use of radial engines in land-based fighters was relatively rare in Europe, as it was believed that their large frontal area would cause too much drag on something as small as a fighter. Tank was not convinced of this, having witnessed the successful use of radial engines by the U.S. Navy, and felt a properly streamlined installation would eliminate this problem.

As to the rest of the design philosophy, Tank wanted something more than an aircraft built only for speed. He outlined the reasoning:

====Engine====

The hottest points on any air-cooled engine are the cylinder heads, located around the circumference of a radial engine. In order to provide sufficient air to cool the engine, airflow had to be maximized at this outer edge. This was normally accomplished by leaving the majority of the front face of the engine open to the air, causing considerable drag. During the late 1920s, NACA led the development of a dramatic improvement by placing an airfoil-shaped ring around the outside of the cylinder heads (the NACA cowling). The shaping accelerated the air as it entered the front of the cowl, increasing the total airflow, and allowing the opening in front of the engine to be made smaller.

Tank introduced a further refinement to this basic concept. He suggested placing most of the airflow components on the propeller, in the form of an oversized propeller spinner whose outside diameter was the same as the engine. The cowl around the engine proper was greatly simplified, essentially a basic cylinder. Air entered through a small hole at the centre of the spinner and was directed through ductwork in the spinner so it was blowing rearward along the cylinder heads. To provide enough airflow, an internal cone was placed in the centre of the hole, over the propeller hub, which was intended to compress the airflow and allow a smaller opening to be used. In theory, the tight-fitting cowling also provided some thrust due to the compression and heating of air as it flowed through the cowling.

The eventual choice of the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling &quot;system&quot; which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler&#x27;s core was in contact with the main cowling&#x27;s sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side on the inside of the oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler&#x27;s core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801&#x27;s motor oil. The rate of cooling airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid in warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.

====Landing gear====
In contrast to the complex, failure-prone fuselage-mounted main gear legs of the earlier Fw 159, one of the main features of the Fw 190 was its wide-tracked, inwards-retracting landing gear. They were designed to withstand a sink rate of , double the strength factor usually required. Hydraulic wheel brakes were used. The wide-track undercarriage produced better ground handling characteristics, and the Fw 190 suffered fewer ground accidents than the Bf 109. (The Bf 109&#x27;s narrow-track, outwards-retracting landing gear hinged on its wing root structure to help lower weight, but this led to inherent weakness and many failures and ground loops.) The Fw 190&#x27;s retractable tail gear used a cable, anchored to the &quot;elbow&quot; at the midpoint of the starboard maingear&#x27;s transverse retraction arms, which ran aftwards within the fuselage to the vertical fin to operate the tailwheel retraction function. The tailwheel&#x27;s retraction mechanical design possessed a set of pulleys to guide the aforementioned cable to the top of the tailwheel&#x27;s oleo strut, pulling it upwards along a diagonal track within the fin, into the lower fuselage; this mechanism was accessible through a prominently visible triangular-shaped hinged panel, on the left side in the fin&#x27;s side sheetmetal covering. On some versions of the Fw 190 an extended tailwheel oleo strut could be fitted for larger-sized loads (such as bombs or even a torpedo) beneath the fuselage.

====Control systems====

Most aircraft of the era used cables and pulleys to operate their controls. The cables tended to stretch, resulting in the sensations of &quot;give&quot; and &quot;play&quot; that made the controls less crisp and responsive, and required constant maintenance to correct. For the new design, the team replaced the cables with rigid pushrods and bearings to eliminate this problem. Another innovation was making the controls as light as possible. The maximum resistance of the ailerons was limited to , as the average man&#x27;s wrist could not exert a greater force. The empennage (tail assembly) featured relatively small and well-balanced horizontal and vertical surfaces.

The design team also attempted to minimize changes in the aircraft&#x27;s trim at varying speeds, thus reducing the pilot&#x27;s workload. They were so successful in this regard that they found in-flight-adjustable aileron and rudder trim tabs were not necessary. Small, fixed tabs were fitted to control surfaces and adjusted for proper balance during initial test flights. Only the elevator trim needed to be adjusted in flight (a feature common to all aircraft). This was accomplished by tilting the entire horizontal tailplane with an electric motor, with an angle of incidence ranging from −3° to +5°.

Another aspect of the new design was the extensive use of electrically powered equipment instead of the hydraulic systems used by most aircraft manufacturers of the time. On the first two prototypes, the main landing gear was hydraulic. Starting with the third prototype, the undercarriage was operated by push buttons controlling electric motors in the wings, and was kept in position by electric up and down-locks. The armament was also loaded and fired electrically. Tank believed that service use would prove that electrically powered systems were more reliable and more rugged than hydraulics, electric lines being much less prone to damage from enemy fire.

====Wing loading and canopy====

Like the Bf 109, the Fw 190 featured a fairly small wing planform with relatively high wing loading. This presents a trade-off in performance. An aircraft with a smaller wing suffers less drag under most flight conditions and therefore flies faster and may have better range. However, it also means the aircraft has a higher stalling speed making it less maneuverable, and also reduces performance in the thinner air at higher altitudes. The wings spanned and had an area of . The wing was designed using the NACA 23015.3 airfoil at the root and the NACA 23009 airfoil at the tip.

Earlier aircraft designs generally featured canopies consisting of small plates of perspex (also known as Plexiglas) in a metal &quot;greenhouse&quot; framework, with the top of the canopy even with the rear fuselage; this was true of the IJNAS Mitsubishi A6M Zero, whose otherwise &quot;all-around view&quot; canopy was still heavily framed. This design considerably limited visibility, especially to the rear. The introduction of vacuum forming, led to the creation of the &quot;bubble canopy&quot; which was largely self-supporting, and could be mounted over the cockpit, offering greatly improved all-round visibility. Tank&#x27;s design for the Fw 190 used a canopy with a frame that ran around the perimeter, with only a short, centerline seam along the top, running rearward from the radio antenna fitting where the three-panel windscreen and the forward edge of the canopy met, just in front of the pilot.

===&quot;Wilde Sau&quot;===
From mid-1943, Fw 190s were also used as night fighters against the growing RAF Bomber Command offensive. In mid-1943, one of the earliest participants in the single-engine, ground controlled, night-fighting experiments was the &quot;Nachtjagdkommando Fw 190&quot; (Night Fighter Command Fw 190), operated by IV. &quot;Gruppe&quot; (4 Group), &quot;Jagdgeschwader 3&quot;, (Fighter Wing 3, or JG 3). The main &quot;Nachtgeschwader&quot; (Night Fighter Wings) were keen to adopt a new fighter type as their twin-engine fighters were too slow for combat against increasing numbers of de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and bombers. Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (NJG 1) and NJG 3 kept a pair of Fw 190s on standby to supplement the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88. The considerable performance advantage of the Fw 190 over the other two types was more than offset by the difficulties of operating at night. Few, if any, aerial successes can be attributed to these operational tests.

One of the first purpose built units to use Fw 190s in this role was &quot;Stab/Versuchskommando Herrmann&quot;, a unit specifically set up in April 1943 by Major Hajo Herrmann. Herrmann&#x27;s unit used standard A-4s and A-5s borrowed from day fighter units to intercept bombers over or near the targeted city, using searchlights and other visual aids to help them find their quarry. The first use of &quot;Window&quot; by the RAF during the Battle of Hamburg in July 1943, rendered the standard nightfighter &quot;Himmelbett&quot; procedures useless and brought urgency to the development of Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Wilde Sau&quot; (&quot;Wild Boar&quot;) technique, pending the development of new nightfighting strategies. Instead of restricting the Fw 190s to ground control interception protocols, the Fw 190s were given a free hand to over-fly bombed areas to see if they could locate bombers using the ground fires below. These tactics became an integral part of the nightfighter operations until May 1944.

St/V Herrmann was expanded to become &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 300 (JG 300, or Fighter Wing 300), JG 301 and JG 302. All three units initially continued borrowing their aircraft from day fighter units. The day fighter units began to protest at the numbers of their aircraft which were being written off because of the hazards of night operations; the numbers soared with the onset of winter, with pilots often being forced to bail-out through being unable to find an airfield at which to land safely. Crash landings were also frequent. Eventually all three &quot;Wilde Sau&quot; units received their own aircraft, which were often modified with exhaust dampers and blind-flying radio equipment. Another unit was &quot;Nachtjagdgruppe 10&quot; (&quot;NJGr 10&quot;), which used Fw 190 A-4/R11s through to A-8/R11s; Fw 190s modified to carry FuG (&quot;Funkgerät&quot;) 217 or FuG 218 radar mid-VHF band equipment.

===The &quot;Sturmböcke&quot;===
The appearance of United States Army Air Forces heavy bombers caused a problem for the German fighter force. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in particular was especially durable, and the armament of the Bf 109 and Fw 190 were not adequate for bomber-destroyer operations. The B-17&#x27;s eventual deployment in combat box formations provided formidable massed firepower from a hundred or more Browning AN/M2 .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns. In addition, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s original solution of &quot;Zerstörer&quot; twin-engine Messerschmitt Bf 110G bomber destroyers, while effective against unescorted Allied bomber formations, lacked maneuverability and were eviscerated by the USAAF&#x27;s fighter escorts in late 1943 and early 1944.

Two of the former &quot;Wilde Sau&quot; single-engined night fighter wings were reconstituted for their use, such as &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 300 (JG 300—300th Fighter Wing) and JG 301. These units consisted of &quot;Sturmböcke&quot;. However, JG 3 also had a special &quot;gruppe&quot; (group) of Sturmböcke.

The Fw 190, designed as a rugged interceptor capable of withstanding considerable combat damage and delivering a potent &quot;punch&quot; from its stable gun platform, was considered ideal for anti-bomber operations. Focke-Wulf redesigned parts of the wing structure to accommodate larger armament. The Fw 190 A-6 was the first sub-variant to undergo this change. Its standard armament was increased from four MG 151/20s to two of them with four more in two underwing cannon pods. The aircraft was designated A-6/R1 (Rüstsatz; or field conversion model). The first aircraft were delivered on 20 November 1943. Brief trials saw the twin cannon replaced by the MK 108 30mm autocannon in the outer wing, which then became the A-6/R2. The cannons were blowback-operated, had electric ignition, and were belt fed. The 30mm MK 108 was simple to make and its construction was economical; the majority of its components consisted of just pressed sheet metal stampings. In the A-6/R4, the GM-1 (nitrous oxide) Boost was added for the BMW 801 engine to increase performance at high altitude. For protection, of armoured glass was added to the canopy. The A-6/R6 was fitted with twin heavy calibre &quot;Werfer-Granate 21&quot; (BR 21) unguided, air-to-air rockets, fired from single underwing tubular launchers (one per wing panel). The increased modifications, in particular heavy firepower, made the Fw 190 a potent bomber-killer. The A-7 evolved in November 1943. Two synchronized 13 mm (.51 inch) MG 131 machine guns replaced the twin cowl-mount synchronized 7.92 mm (.318 inch) MG 17 machine guns. The A-7/R variants could carry two 30 mm MK 108s as well as BR 21 rockets. This increased its potency as a &quot;Pulk-Zerstörer&quot; (Bomber Formation Destroyer). The A-8/R2 was the most numerous &quot;Sturmbock&quot; aircraft, some 900 were built by Fiesler at Kassel with 30 mm MK 108s installed in their outer wing panel mounts.

While formidable bomber-killers, the armour and substantial up-gunning with heavier calibre firepower meant the Fw 190 was now cumbersome to maneuver. Vulnerable to Allied fighters, they had to be escorted by Bf 109s. When the &quot;Sturmgruppe&quot; was able to work as intended, the effects were devastating. With their engines and cockpits heavily armored, the Fw 190 As attacked from astern and gun camera films show that these attacks were often pressed to within 100 yds (90 m).

Willy Unger of 11.(&quot;Sturm&quot;)/JG 3 (11 &quot;Staffel&quot; (Squadron) of &quot;Sturmgruppe&quot; (Storm group) JG 3) made the following comments:

Richard Franz commented:

The number of heavy bombers destroyed by the Fw 190 is impossible to estimate. However, below is a list of the top scoring &quot;Sturmbock&quot; pilots:

==Variants==

===First prototypes (BMW 139)===

;Fw 190 V1:(civil registration D-OPZE), powered by a BMW 139 14-cylinder two-row radial engine. D-OPZE first flew on 1 June 1939.
;Fw 190 V2: Designated with the alphabetic ID code of &quot;FL+OZ&quot; (later RM+CB) the V2 first flew on October 31, 1939, and was equipped from the outset with the new spinner and cooling fan. It was armed with one MG 17 machine gun and one synchronized MG 131 machine gun in each wing root.
;Fw 190 V3:Abandoned
;Fw 190 V4:Abandoned

===Later prototypes (BMW 801)===

;Fw 190 V5:Fitted with the larger, more powerful 14-cylinder two-row BMW 801 radial engine. This engine introduced a pioneering example of an engine management system called the (command-device) designed by BMW, who also designed the 801&#x27;s forward cowling with its integral oil cooling system: the functioned in effect as an electro-mechanical computer which set mixture, propeller pitch (for the constant-speed propeller), boost, and magneto timing.
;Fw 190 V5k: ( – small surface) The smaller span initial variant re-designated after the longer span wing was fitted. The V5 first flew in the early spring of 1940. The weight increase with all of the modifications was substantial, about , leading to higher wing loading and a deterioration in handling. Plans were made to create a new wing with more area to address these issues.
;Fw 190 V5g: ( – large surface) In August 1940 a collision with a ground vehicle damaged the V5 and it was sent back to the factory for major repairs. This was an opportune time to rebuild it with a new wing which was less tapered in plan than the original design, extending the leading and trailing edges outward to increase the area. The new wing had an area of , and now spanned . After conversion, the aircraft was called the &quot;V5g&quot; for (large surface). Although it was slower than when fitted with the small wing, &quot;V5g&quot; was much more manoeuvrable and had a faster climb rate. This new wing platform was to be used for all major production versions of the Fw 190.

===Fw 190 A===

;Fw 190 A-0: The pre-production Fw 190 A-0 series was ordered in November 1940, a total of 28 being completed. Because they were built before the new wing design was fully tested and approved, the first nine A-0s retained the original small wings. All were armed with six MG 17 machine guns – four synchronised weapons, two in the forward fuselage and one in each wing root, supplemented by a free-firing MG 17 in each wing, outboard of the propeller disc.
;Fw 190 A-1: The Fw 190 A-1 was in production from June 1941. It was powered by the BMW 801 C-1 engine, rated at for take-off. Armament included two fuselage-mounted MG 17s and two wing root-mounted MG 17s (with all four MG 17s synchronized to fire through the propeller arc) and two outboard wing-mounted 20 mm MG FF/Ms.
;Fw 190 A-2:The introduction of the BMW 801 C-2 resulted in the Fw 190 A-2 model, first introduced in October 1941. The A-2 wing weaponry was updated, with the two wing root-mounted MG 17s being replaced by 20 mm MG 151/20E cannon.
;Fw 190 A-3: The Fw 190 A-3 was equipped with the BMW 801 D-2 engine, which increased power to at takeoff. The A-3 retained the same weaponry as the A-2.
:;Fw 190 A-3/ 1 (/U1): (W.Nr 130 270) was the first 190 to have the engine mount extended by , which would be standardized on the later production A-5 model.
:;Fw 190 A-3/U2: The A-3/U2 (W.Nr 130386) had RZ 65 rocket launcher racks under the wings with three rockets per wing. There were also a small number of U7 aircraft tested as high-altitude fighters armed with only two 20 mm MG 151 cannon, but with reduced overall weight.
:;Fw 190 A-3/U3: The A-3/U3 was the first of the (), using an ETC-501 centre-line bomb rack able to carry up to of bombs or, with horizontal stabilising bars, one standard Luftwaffe drop tank. The U3 retained the fuselage-mounted MG 17s and the wing-mounted 20 mm MG 151 cannon, with the outer MG FF being removed.
:;Fw 190 A-3/U4: The A-3/U4 was a reconnaissance version with two RB 12.5 cameras in the rear fuselage and a EK 16 gun camera or a Robot II miniature camera in the leading edge of the port wing root. Armament was similar to the U3, however, and the ETC 501 was usually fitted with the standardized Luftwaffe drop tank.
;Fw 190 A-3a: (a= – foreign) In autumn 1942, 72 new aircraft were delivered to Turkey in an effort to keep that country friendly to the Axis powers. These were designated Fw 190 A-3a, designation for export models and delivered between October 1942 and March 1943.
;Fw 190 A-4: Introduced in July 1942, the A-4 was equipped with the same engine and basic armament as the A-3.
:;Fw 190 A-4/ 6 (/R6): Some A-4s were fitted with a pair of under-wing 21 (BR 21) rocket mortars, and were designated Fw 190 A-4/R6.
:;Fw 190 A-4/U1: The A-4/U1 was outfitted with an ETC 501 rack under the fuselage. All armament except the MG 151 cannon was removed.
:;Fw 190 A-4/U3: The A-4/U3 was very similar to the U1, and later served as the prototype for the Fw 190 F-1 assault fighter.
:;Fw 190 A-4/U4: The A-4/U4 was a reconnaissance fighter, with two Rb 12.4 cameras in the rear fuselage and an EK 16 or Robot II gun camera. The U4 was equipped with fuselage-mounted MG 17s and 20 mm MG 151 cannon.
:;Fw 190 A-4/U7: The A-4/U7 was a high-altitude fighter, easily identified by the compressor air intakes on either side of the cowling. Adolf Galland flew a U7 in the spring of 1943.
:;Fw 190 A-4/U8: The A-4/U8 was the (, long-range fighter-bomber), adding twin standard Luftwaffe drop tanks, one under each wing, on VTr-Ju 87 racks with duralumin fairings produced by Weserflug, and a centreline bomb rack. The outer wing-mounted 20 mm MG FF/M cannon and the cowling-mounted MG 17 were removed to save weight. The A-4/U8 was the precursor of the Fw 190 G-1.
:;Fw 190 A-4/R1: The A-4/R1, was fitted with a FuG 16ZY radio set with a Morane &quot;whip&quot; aerial fitted under the port wing. These aircraft, called or Fighter Formation Leaders, could be tracked and directed from the ground via special R/T equipment called Y- (Y-Control). More frequent use of this equipment was made from the A-5 onwards.
;Fw 190 A-5: The A-5 was developed after it was determined that the Fw 190 could easily carry more ordnance. The D-2 engine was moved forward another as had been tried out earlier on the service test A-3/U1 aircraft, moving the centre of gravity forward to allow more weight to be carried aft.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U2: The A-5/U2 was designed as a night and featured anti-reflective fittings and exhaust flame dampers. A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted drop tanks. A EK16 gun camera, as well as landing lights, were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20 mm MG 151 cannon.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U3: The A-5/U3 was a &quot;Jabo&quot; fighter fitted with ETC 501s for drop tanks and bombs; it too featured only two MG 151s for armament.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U4: The A-5/U4 was a &quot;recon&quot; fighter with two RB 12.5 cameras and all armament of the basic A-5 with the exception of the MG FF cannon.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U8: The A-5/U8 was another outfitted with SC-250 centreline-mounted bombs, under-wing 300-litre drop tanks and only two MG 151s; it later became the Fw 190 G-2.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U9: Test installation of the A-7 modifications.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U12: A special U12 was created for bomber attack, outfitted with the standard MG 17 and 20 mm MG 151 but replacing the outer wing 20 mm MG-FF cannon with two underwing gun pods containing two 20 mm MG 151/20 each, for a total of two machine guns and six cannon.
:;Fw 190 A-5/U14: Was able to carry a torpedo (Stkz TD+SI White 871).
:;Fw 190 A-5/R11: The A-5/R11 was a night fighter conversion fitted with FuG 217 (Neptune) radar equipment with arrays of three dipole antenna elements vertically mounted fore and aft of the cockpit and above and below the wings. Flame-dampening boxes were fitted over the exhaust exits. A total of 1,752 A-5s were built from November 1942 to June 1943.

;Fw 190 A-6: The A-6 was developed to address shortcomings found in previous &quot;A&quot; models when attacking U.S. heavy bombers. A structurally redesigned and lighter wing was introduced and the normal armament was increased to two MG 17 fuselage machine guns and four 20 mm MG 151/20E wing root and outer wing cannon with larger ammunition boxes.
;Fw 190 A-7: The A-7 entered production in November 1943, equipped with the BMW 801 D-2 engine, again producing and two fuselage-mounted MG 131s, replacing the MG 17s. 
;Fw 190 A-8: The A-8 entered production in February 1944, powered either by the standard BMW 801 D-2 or the 801Q (also known as 801TU). The 801Q/TU, with the &quot;T&quot; signifying a unitized powerplant installation, was a standard 801D with improved, thicker armour on the BMW-designed front annular cowling, which still incorporated the BMW-designed oil cooler, upgraded from on earlier models to . Changes introduced in the Fw 190 A-8 also included the C3-injection emergency boost system to the fighter variant of the Fw 190 A (a similar system with less power had been fitted to some earlier variants of the 190 A), raising power to for 10 minutes. The 10 minute emergency power may be used up to three times per mission with a 10 minute cooldown in &quot;combat power&quot; between each 10 minute use of emergency power. 
:;Fw 190 A-8/R2: The A-8/R2 replaced the outer wing 20 mm cannon with a MK 108 cannon.
:;Fw 190 A-8/R4: The A-8/R4 featured GM1 nitrous boost to the standard BMW 801 D/Q engine. GM1 (nitrous oxide) injection increased power for short amounts of time, up to 10 minutes at a time. A 20 minute supply was usually carried.
:;Fw 190 A-8/R8: The A-8/R8 was similar to the A-8/R2, but fitted with heavy armour including canopy and windscreen armour and cockpit armour.
;Fw 190 A-9: First built in September 1944, the Fw 190 A-9 was fitted with the new BMW 801S rated at ; the more powerful 801F-1 was still under development, and not yet available.
;Fw 190 A-10: Late in the war, the A-10 was fitted with larger wings for better maneuverability at higher altitudes, which could have allowed additional calibre, long-barreled MK 103 cannon to be fitted.

A total of 13,291 Fw 190 A-model aircraft were produced.

A-6, A-7, and A-8 were modified for Sturmböcke bomber-destroyer operations.

===High-altitude developments===

Tank started looking at ways to address the altitude performance problem early in the program. In 1941, he proposed a number of versions featuring new powerplants, and he suggested using turbochargers in place of superchargers. Three such installations were outlined

;Fw 190 V12: (an A-0) would be outfitted with many of the elements which eventually led to the B series.
;Fw 190 V13: (W.Nr. 0036) first C-series prototype
;Fw 190 V15: (W.Nr. 0036) second C-series prototype
;Fw 190 V16: (W.Nr. 0036) third C-series prototype
;Fw 190 V18: (W.Nr. 0036) fourth C-series prototype
;Fw 190 B-0: With a turbocharged BMW 801
;Fw 190 B-1: This aircraft was similar to the B-0, but had slightly different armament. In its initial layout, the B-1 was to be fitted with four MG 17s and two 20 mm MG-FFs. One was fitted with two MG 17s, two 20 mm MG 151s and two 20 mm MG-FFs. After the completion of W.Nr. 811, no further Fw 190 B models were ordered.
====V-12 Engine====
;Fw 190 C: With a turbocharged Daimler-Benz DB 603, the tail of the aircraft had to be lengthened in order to maintain the desired centre of gravity. Four additional prototypes based on the V18/U1 followed: V29, V30, V32 and V33.
;Fw 190 D: The Fw 190 D (nicknamed &quot;Dora&quot;; or Long-Nose Dora () was intended as the high-altitude performance version of the A-series.
;Fw 190 D-0: The first D-0 prototype was completed in October 1942 with a supercharged Junkers Jumo 213 including a pressurized cockpit and other features making them more suitable for high-altitude work. 
;Fw 190 D-1: Initial production
;Fw 190 D-2: Initial production
;Fw 190 D-9: The D-9 series was rarely used against heavy-bomber raids, as the circumstances of the war in late 1944 meant that fighter-versus-fighter combat and ground attack missions took priority. This model was the basis for the follow-on Focke-Wulf Ta 152 aircraft.
;Fw 190 D-11: Fitted with the up-rated Jumo 213F series engine similar to the Jumo 213E used in the Ta-152 H series but minus the intercooler. Two MK 108 cannons were installed in the outer wings to complement the 20 mm MG 151s in the inboard positions. 
;Fw 190 D-12: Similar to the D-11, but featured the MK 108 cannon in a &quot;Motorkanone&quot; installation firing through the propeller hub.
;Fw 190 D-13: The D-13 would be fitted with a 20 mm MG 151/20 motor cannon.

===Ground attack versions (BMW 801)===

;Fw 190 F: The Fw 190F configuration was originally tested in a Fw 190 A-0/U4, starting in May 1942, fitted with centre-line and wing-mounted bomb racks.
;Fw 190 F-1: Renamed A-4/U3s of which 18 were built
;Fw 190 F-2: Renamed A-5/U3s, of which 270 were built according to Focke-Wulf production logs and Ministry of Aviation acceptance reports.
;Fw 190 F-3: Developed under the designation Fw 190 A-5/U17, which was outfitted with a centreline mounted ETC 501 bomb rack. The Fw 190 F-3/R1 had two additional ETC 50 bomb racks under each wing. The F-3 could carry a 66-Imp gal (300 liter) drop tank. A total of 432 Fw 190 F-3s were built.
;Fw 190 F-4 to F-7: designations used for projects.


;Fw 190 F-8: Based on the A-8 Fighter, having a slightly modified injector on the compressor which allowed for increased performance at lower altitudes for several minutes. Armament of the Fw 190 F-8 was two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon in the wing roots and two MG 131 machine guns above the engine. It was outfitted with an ETC 501 Bomb rack as centerline mount and four ETC 50 bomb racks as underwing mounts.
:;Fw 190 F-8/U1 : long range , fitted with underwing V.Mtt-Schloß shackles to hold two of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s standardized drop tanks. ETC 503 bomb racks were also fitted, allowing the Fw 190 F-8/U1 to carry one SC 250 bomb under each wing and one SC 250 bomb on the centreline.
:;Fw 190 F-8/U2 : prototype torpedo bomber, fitted with an ETC 503 bomb rack under each wing and a centre-line mounted ETC 504. The U2 was also equipped with the TSA 2 A weapons sighting system that improved the U2&#x27;s ability to attack seaborne targets with a BT 700.
:;Fw 190 F-8/U3 : heavy torpedo bomber was outfitted with an ETC 502, which allowed it to carry one BT-1400 heavy torpedo (). Owing to the size of the torpedo, the U3&#x27;s tail gear needed to be lengthened. The U3 also was fitted with the 2,000 PS BMW 801S engine, and the tail from the Ta 152.
:;Fw 190 F-8/U4 : created as a night bomber, was equipped with flame dampers on the exhaust and various electrical systems such as the FuG 101 radio altimeter, the PKS 12 automatic pilot, and the TSA 2 A sighting system. The U4 was fitted with only two MG 151/20 cannon as fixed armament.
:;Fw 190 F-8/R3 : project with two underwing mounted 30mm MK 103 cannon.
;Fw 190 F-9: based on the Fw 190 A-9, equipped with a new bulged canopy as fitted to late-build F-8s and A-8s, and four ETC 50 or ETC 70 bomb racks under the wings. According to Ministry of Aviation acceptance reports, 147 F-9s were built in January 1945, and perhaps several hundred more from February to May 1945. (Data for these months is missing and probably lost.)
;Fw 190 G: The Fw 190 G was built as a long-range attack aircraft (&quot;Jagdbomber mit vergrösserter Reichweite&quot; – abbreviated ). Following the success of the Fw 190 F as a (close support, or &quot;strike aircraft&quot;), both the Luftwaffe and Focke-Wulf began investigating ways of extending the range of the Fw 190 F. Approximately 1,300 Fw 190 Gs of all variants were new built.
;Fw 190 G-1: The G-1 was renamed from A-4/U8 s. Initial testing found that if all but two wing root mounted 20 mm MG 151 cannons (with reduced ammunition load) were removed, the Fw 190 G-1 (as it was now called) could carry a or bomb on the centreline and up to a bomb under each wing.
;Fw 190 G-2: The G-2 was renamed from Fw 190 A-5/U8 aircraft, similar to the G-1; the underwing drop tank racks were replaced with the much simpler fittings, to allow for a number of underwing configurations.
;Fw 190 G-3: The G-3 was based on A-6 with all but the two wing root mounted MG 151 cannons removed. The new V.Fw. Trg bombracks, however, allowed the G-3 to simultaneously carry fuel tanks and bomb loads
:;Fw 190 G-3/R1 : The G-3/R1 replaced the V.Fw. Trg racks with a pair of WB 151/20 conformal cannon pods; each mounting a pair of Mauser MG 151/20 autocannon, giving the G-3/R1 – with its existing pair of wing-root mounted, synchronized MG 151/20 autocannon, a total of six such ordnance pieces.
:;Fw 190 G-3/R5 : The G-3/R5 was similar to the R1, but the V.Fw. Trg racks were removed, and two ETC 50 racks per wing were added.
;Fw 190 G-8: The G-8 was based on the Fw 190 A-8, using the same &quot;bubble&quot; canopy as the F-8 and fitted with underwing ETC 503 racks that could carry either bombs or drop tanks.
:;Fw 190 G-8/R4 : The G-8/R4 kit was a planned refit for the GM 1 engine boost system, but never made it into production.
:;Fw 190 G-8/R5 : The G-8/R5 kit replaced the ETC 503 racks with two ETC 50 or 71 racks.

===Trainer versions===

;Fw 190 A-5/U1: Several old Fw 190 A-5s were converted by replacing the MW 50 tank with a second cockpit. The canopy was modified, replaced with a new three-section unit that opened to the side. The rear portion of the fuselage was closed off with sheet metal.
;Fw 190 A-8/U1: A similar conversion to the A-5/U1.
;Fw 190 S-5: A-5/U1 trainers re-designated.
;Fw 190 S-8: A-8/U1 trainers re-designated. An estimated 58 Fw 190 S-5 and S-8 models were converted or built.

==Combat history==

The Fw 190 participated on every major combat front where the Luftwaffe operated after 1941, and did so with success in a variety of roles. The Fw 190 first tasted combat on the Western Front in August 1941, where it proved superior to the Mk V Spitfire. The Spitfire&#x27;s main advantage over the Fw 190, and the Bf 109 as well, was its superior turn radius. Beyond that, the Fw 190 outperformed the Spitfire Mk. V in most areas, such as roll rate, speed, acceleration, and dive performance. The addition of the Fw 190 to the Jagdwaffe allowed the Germans to fight off RAF attacks and achieve local air superiority over German skies until the summer of 1942, when the improved Spitfire Mk. IX was introduced. In June 1942, Oberleutnant Armin Faber of JG 2 landed his Fw 190 A-3 at a British airfield, allowing the RAF to test the Mk. IX against the 190 and learn tactics to counter it.

==Production==
A Focke-Wulf plant east of Marienburg was bombed by the Eighth Air Force on 9 October 1944. In addition, one of the most important sub-contractors for the radial-engined Fw 190s was AGO Flugzeugwerke, which from 1941 through to the end of the war produced enough Fw 190s to earn it major attention from the USAAF, with the AGO plant in Oschersleben being attacked at least five times during the war from 1943 onwards.

==Surviving aircraft and modern replicas==

Some 28 original Fw 190s are in museums or in the hands of private collectors around the world.

In 1997 a German company, Flug Werk GmbH, began manufacturing new Fw 190 models as reproductions. By 2012, 20 had been produced, most flyable, a few as static display models, with airworthy examples usually powered by Chinese-manufactured Shvetsov ASh-82 twin-row, 14-cylinder radial powerplants, which have a displacement of 41.2 litres, close to the BMW 801&#x27;s 41.8 litres, with the same engine cylinder arrangement and number of cylinders.
The nearly intact wreck of an Fw 190 A-5/U3 ( 151 227) that had crashed in a marsh in a forest near Leningrad, Soviet Union, 1943 was located in 1989. After restoration in the US, the Fw 190 flew again (with the original BMW 801 powerplant) on 1 December 2010. Following the successful test flight, the aircraft was then trucked up to the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum in Everett, Washington, where it was reassembled in April 2011 and returned to airworthy condition.

At least five surviving Fw 190A radial-engined aircraft are known to have been assigned to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s JG 5 wing in Herdla, Norway. More German fighter aircraft on display in museums in the 21st century have originated from this unit than from any other Axis Powers&#x27; military aviation unit of World War II.

The Turkish Air Force retired all of its Fw 190A-3 fleet at the end of 1947 mostly because of a lack of spare parts. It is rumored that American-Turkish bilateral agreements required retiring and scrapping of all German-origin aircraft, although that requirement did not exist for any other country. According to the &quot;Hürriyet Daily News&quot;, all of the retired Fw 190s were saved from scrapping by wrapping them with protective cloths and burying them in the soil near the Aviation Supply and Maintenance Center at Kayseri. All attempts to locate and recover the aircraft have been unsuccessful, which suggests the story is probably a hoax or myth.

==Operators==

** Czechoslovakian Air Force (Postwar)
** French Air Force – 70 aircraft of the Fw 190 A-5/A-6 model were reassembled at a forward repair shop the Germans had hastily abandoned using the SNCAC NC.900 designation. The aircraft were used operationally for a short period and withdrawn due to problems with the BMW 801 engine.
** French Navy (Postwar)
** &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;
** Royal Hungarian Air Force received a total of 72 Fw 190F-8s starting in November 1944. They were operated by the 102. , later 102. (102nd Fighter-Bomber Squadron, later Wing) engaging in close-support missions on the Eastern Front in 1944–45. The planes were nicknamed &quot;Fóka&quot; (Seal), a wordplay on the German name &quot;Focke&quot;.
** The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service received one Fw 190A-5 for evaluation purposes.
** Spanish Air Force – The Spanish Air Force operated Fw 190A-2,3,4 among Fw 190 A-8 and Gs with volunteers of (&quot;15ª&quot; , JG 51 &quot;Mölders&quot; VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot;, belonged in &quot;LuftFlotte&quot; 4) on the Eastern Front (from Orel during September 1942 to Bobruisk, during July 1943) and Defense of the Reich over Germany.
** Royal Romanian Air Force – Following the 23 August 1944 coup by King Michael, which resulted in Romania leaving the Axis powers, Romania captured 22 Luftwaffe Fw 190 As and Fs. They were not used operationally. Nine serviceable Fw 190s were later confiscated by the Soviet Union.
** Soviet Air Force – A number of captured aircraft were trialled by the NII VVS (Air Force Scientific Test Institute), including Fw 190 A-4, A-5 and A-8 models, as well as the long-nose D-9. 
** Soviet Naval Aviation – The Baltic Fleet Air Arm operated a number of Fw 190 D-9 models that were captured in East Prussia, including couple of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9s captured intact by the 2 Guards IAP of 322 IAD at a Focke-Wulf facility near Marienburg. Various photos exist of these machines in Marienburg in the summer of 1945, but little is known of their use.
** Turkish Air Force – Beginning in mid-1942, received 72 examples of the Fw 190 A-3a (export model of A-3, the &quot;a&quot; stood for – foreign) from Germany to modernize their air force. These aircraft were basically Fw 190 A-3s, with BMW 801 D-2 engines and FuG VIIa radios and an armament fit of four MG 17s, with the option of installing two MG-FF/M cannon in the outer wing positions. The export order was completed between October 1942 and March 1943. The Fw 190 remained in Turkish service until late 1947 when they were retired due to a lack of spare parts.
** Royal Air Force – No. 1426 (Enemy Aircraft) Flight RAF evaluated at least one captured Fw 190A-3.
** United States Army Air Forces and United States Navy – A small number of captured Fw 190As fell into American hands in Europe and North Africa, with one captured A-5 model, WkNr. 150 051, being flown for a time at the Patuxent Naval Air Test Center by the U.S. Navy during the war years.
** SFR Yugoslav Air Force – Postwar, one aircraft.

<text>The Panzerkampfwagen III (Pz.Kpfw. III), commonly known as the Panzer III, was a medium tank developed in the 1930s by Germany, and was used extensively in World War II. The official German ordnance designation was [[List of Sd.Kfz. designations|Sd.Kfz.]] 141. It was intended to fight other armoured fighting vehicles and serve alongside and support the similar Panzer IV, which was originally designed for infantry support.

Initially the Panzer III had the same 3.7 cm gun as the infantry used for anti-tank work but later models were given 5 cm gun. This was the largest gun that could be fitted within the limitations of the turret ring but was insufficient against Soviet T-34 and KV-1 tanks. The Panzer IV, which had a larger turret ring, was redesigned to mount the long-barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 40 gun and became the main German tank instead. From 1942 the last version of the Panzer III (Panzer III N) mounted the short barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 which was used on the first Panzer IVs, meaning the Panzer III and the Panzer IV had effectively swapped roles.

Production of the Panzer III ceased in 1943 but the Sturmgeschütz III assault gun which had been developed from the Panzer III chassis continued in production until the end of the war. About 18,000 vehicles based on the Panzer III chasis were produced 
between all variants, by far the most of any German AFV design in World War II and over a quarter of all tanks and assault guns produced by Nazi Germany.

==Development history==

===Background===
At the time, German (non-light) tanks were expected to carry out one of two primary tasks when assisting infantry in breakthroughs, exploiting gaps in the enemy lines where opposition had been removed, moving through and attacking the enemy&#x27;s unprotected lines of communication and the rear areas. The first task was direct combat against other tanks and other armoured vehicles, requiring the tank to fire armour piercing (AP) shells.

On January 11, 1934, following specifications laid down by Heinz Guderian, the Army Weapons Department drew up plans for a medium tank with a maximum weight of and a top speed of . It was intended as the main tank of the German Panzer divisions, capable of engaging and destroying opposing tank forces, and was to be paired with the Panzer IV, which was to fulfill the second use: dealing with anti-tank guns and infantry strong points, such as machine-gun nests, firing high-explosive shells at such soft targets. Such supportive tanks designed to operate with friendly infantry against the enemy generally were heavier and carried more armour.
The direct infantry-support role was to be provided by the turret-less &quot;Sturmgeschütz&quot; assault gun, which mounted a short-barrelled gun on a Panzer III chassis.

===Development===
Daimler-Benz, Krupp, MAN, and Rheinmetall all produced prototypes. Testing of these took place in 1936 and 1937, leading to the Daimler-Benz design being chosen for production. The first model of the Panzer III, the &quot;Ausführung A.&quot; (Ausf. A), came off the assembly line in May 1937; ten, two of which were unarmed, were produced in that year. Mass production of the Ausf. F version began in 1939. Between 1937 and 1940, attempts were made to standardize parts between Krupp&#x27;s Panzer IV and Daimler-Benz&#x27;s Panzer III.

Much of the early development work on the Panzer III was a quest for a suitable suspension. Several varieties of leaf-spring suspensions were tried on Ausf. A through Ausf. D, usually using eight relatively small-diameter road wheels before the torsion-bar suspension of the Ausf. E was standardized, using the six road wheel design that became standard. The Panzer III, along with the Soviet KV heavy tank, was one of the early tanks to use this suspension design first seen on the Stridsvagn L-60 a few years earlier.

A distinct feature of the Panzer III, influenced by the British Vickers Medium Mark I tank (1924), was the three-man turret. This meant that the commander was not distracted with another role in the tank (e.g. as gunner or loader) and could fully concentrate on maintaining awareness of the situation and directing the tank. Most tanks of the time did not have this capability, providing the Panzer III with a combat advantage versus such tanks. For example, the French Somua S-35&#x27;s turret was manned only by the commander, and the Soviet T-34 originally had a two-man turret crew. Unlike the Panzer IV, the Panzer III had no turret basket, merely a foot rest platform for the gunner.

The Panzer III was intended as the primary battle tank of the German forces. However, when it initially met the KV-1 heavy tanks and T-34 medium tanks it proved to be inferior in both armour and gun power. To meet the growing need to counter these tanks, the Panzer III was up-gunned to the 5 cm KwK 39, a longer, more powerful gun, and received more armour but still was at disadvantage compared with the Soviet tank designs. As a result, production of self-propelled anti-tank guns (&quot;Panzerjaeger&quot;), as well as the up-gunning of the Panzer IV was initiated.

In 1942, the final version of the Panzer III, the Ausf. N, was created with a KwK 37 L/24 cannon, the same short-barreled low-velocity gun used for the initial models of the Panzer IV and designed for anti-infantry and close-support work. For defensive purposes, the Ausf. N was equipped with rounds of HEAT ammunition that could penetrate of armour depending on the round&#x27;s variant, but these were strictly used for self-defence.

===Armour===
The Panzer III Ausf. A through C had of rolled homogeneous armour on all sides with on the top and on the bottom. This was quickly determined to be insufficient, and was upgraded to on the front, sides and rear in the Ausf. D, E, F, and G models, with the H model having a second layer of face-hardened steel applied to the front and rear hull. The Ausf. J model had a solid plate on the front and rear, while the Ausf. J¹, L, and M models had an additional layer of offset homogeneous steel plate on the front hull and turret, with the M model having an additional &quot;Schürzen&quot; spaced armour on the hull sides, and on the turret sides and rear. This additional frontal armor gave the Panzer III frontal protection from many light and medium Allied and Soviet anti-tank guns at all but close ranges. However, the sides were still vulnerable to many enemy weapons, including anti-tank rifles at close ranges.

===Armament===
The Panzer III was intended to fight other tanks; in the initial design stage a gun was specified. However, the infantry at the time were being equipped with the PaK 36, and it was thought that, in the interest of standardization, the tanks should carry the same armament. As a compromise, the turret ring was made large enough to accommodate a gun should a future upgrade be required. This single decision later assured the Panzer III a prolonged life in the German Army.
The Ausf. A to early Ausf. G were equipped with a 3.7 cm KwK 36 L/45, which proved adequate during the campaigns of 1939 and 1940. In response to increasingly better armed and armored opponents, the later Ausf. F to Ausf. J were upgraded with the 5 cm KwK 38 L/42, and the Ausf. J¹ to M with the longer 5 cm KwK 39 L/60 gun.

By 1942, the Panzer IV was becoming Germany&#x27;s main medium tank because of its better upgrade potential. The Panzer III remained in production as a close support vehicle. The Ausf. N model mounted a low-velocity 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 gun - these guns had originally been fitted to older Panzer IV Ausf A to F1 models and had been placed in storage when those tanks had also been up armed to longer versions of the 75 mm gun.

All early models up to and including the Ausf. G had two  MG 34 machine guns mounted coaxially with the 37 mm main gun and a similar weapon in a hull mount. Models from the Ausf. F and later, upgraded or built with a 5 or 7.5 cm main gun, had a single coaxial MG 34 and the hull MG34.

A single experimental Ausf. L was fitted with a 75/55mm tapered bore Waffe 0725 cannon. The vehicle was designated &quot;Panzer&quot; III &quot;Ausf L mit Waffe&quot; 0725.

===Mobility===
The Panzer III Ausf. A to D were powered by a , 12-cylinder Maybach HL108 TR engine, giving a top speed of . All later models were powered by the , 12-cylinder Maybach HL 120 TRM engine. Regulated top speed varied, depending on the transmission and weight, but was around .

The fuel capacity was in Ausf A-D, in Ausf. E-G and in all later models. Road range on the main tank was in Ausf. A-J; the heavier later models had a reduced range of . Cross-country range was in all versions.

== Combat history ==
The Panzer III was used in the German campaigns in Poland, in France, in the Soviet Union, and in North Africa. Many were still in combat service against Western Allied forces in 1944-1945: at Anzio in Italy, in Normandy, in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands and in East Prussia against the Red Army. A sizeable number of Panzer IIIs also remained as armoured reserves in German-occupied Norway and some saw action, alongside Panzer IVs, in the Lapland War against Finland in the fall of 1944.

In both the Polish and French campaigns, the Panzer III formed a small part of the German armoured forces. Only a few hundred Panzer III Ausf. As to Fs were available in these two campaigns, with most being armed with the main gun. They were the best medium tank available to the German military at the period of time.

Aside from use in Europe, the Panzer III also saw service in North Africa with Erwin Rommel&#x27;s renowned Afrika Korps from early 1941. Most of the Panzer IIIs with the Afrika Korps were equipped with the (short-barrelled) KwK 38 L/42 50mm tank gun, with a small number possessing the older 37mm main gun of earlier variants. The Panzer IIIs of Rommel&#x27;s troops were capable of fighting against British Crusader cruiser and US-supplied M3 Stuart light tanks with positive outcomes, although they did less effectively against heavily armoured Matilda II infantry tanks and the American M3 Lee/Grant medium tanks (fielded by the British starting from early 1942). In particular, the 75mm hull-mounted gun of the Lee/Grant tank could easily destroy a Panzer III far beyond the latter&#x27;s own effective firing range, as did the similarly equipped M4 Sherman, which first saw combat with British forces in North Africa in October 1942. 

Around the time of the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941, the Panzer III was, numerically, the most important German tank on the frontline. At this time period, the majority of the available tanks (including re-armed Ausf. Es and Fs, plus new Ausf. G and H models) for the invading German military had the KwK 38 L/42 50mm cannon. Initially, the most numerous Soviet tanks the Germans encountered at the start of the invasion were older T-26 light infantry and BT class of cruiser tanks. This fact, together with superior German tactical and strategic skills in armoured clashes, sufficient quality crew training, and the generally-good ergonomics of the Panzer III, all contributed to a favourable kill-loss ratio of approximately 6:1 for German tanks of all types in 1941. However, the Panzer IIIs were significantly outclassed by the more advanced Soviet T-34 medium and KV series of heavy tanks, the former of which was gradually encountered in greater numbers by the German forces as the invasion progressed.

With the appearance of the T-34 and KV-1/-2 tanks, rearming the Panzer III with a longer-barrelled and more powerful gun was prioritised. The T-34 was generally invulnerable in frontal combat engagements with the Panzer III until the 50 mm KwK 39 L/60 tank gun was introduced on the Panzer III Ausf. J beginning in the spring of 1942 (this tank gun was based on the infantry&#x27;s 5 cm Pak 38 L/60 towed anti-tank gun). This could penetrate the T-34&#x27;s heavy sloped armour frontally at ranges under . Against the KV class of heavy breakthrough tanks, the Panzer III was a significant threat if it was armed with special high-velocity tungsten-tipped armour-piercing (AP) rounds. In addition, to counter enemy anti-tank rifles, starting from 1943, the Ausf. L version began the use of spaced armour sideskirts and screens (known as &quot;Schürzen&quot; in German) around the turret and on the vulnerable hull-sides. However, due to the introduction of the upgunned and better armoured Panzer IV, the Panzer III was, after the German defeat at the Battle of Kursk in the summer of 1943, relegated to secondary/minor combat roles, such as tank-training, and it was finally replaced as the main German medium tank by the Panzer IV and the Panzer V Panther.

The Panzer III&#x27;s strong, reliable and durable chassis was the basis for the turretless Sturmgeschütz III assault gun/tank destroyer, one of the most successful self-propelled guns of the war, as well as being the single most-produced German armoured fighting vehicle design of World War II.

By the end of the war in 1945, the Panzer III saw almost no frontline use, and many of them had been returned to the few remaining armaments/tank factories for conversion into ammunition carriers or recovery vehicles. A few other variants of the Panzer III were also experimented on and produced by German industries towards the last phases of the war, but few were mass-produced or even saw action against the encroaching enemy forces of the Americans, British and Soviets.

== Foreign users ==
In 1943, Turkey received 22 Panzer III Ausf. Ms, with Hitler hoping the country, militarily strengthened by Nazi Germany, could possibly threaten the Soviet Union from its southern border (in any case, neutral Turkey did not participate in any form of aggression towards the USSR or the Western Allies, and eventually declared war on Nazi Germany nearing the end of WWII instead, perhaps from Allied pressure). The Army of the Independent State of Croatia received 4 Ausf. N variants in the spring of 1944 and the Ustashe Militia received 20 other Ausf. Ns in the autumn of 1944. Romania received a number of Panzer III Ausf. Ns for its 1st Armored Division in 1943. They were called T-3 in the Romanian army. At least 2 of them were still operational in 1945.

Norway used leftover stocks of ex-German Panzer IIIs (along with similar Sturmgeschütz III assault guns/tank destroyers) abandoned by departing Nazi occupation forces at the end of WWII up until the 1950s. In the Soviet Union, the Panzer III was one of the more common captured Nazi tanks they operated, as with the Panzer IV. At least 200, together with some StuG IIIs, fell into Soviet hands following the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad. The Soviets decided to upgun these captured German vehicles and two resulting designs were produced: the SG-122 self-propelled howitzer and the SU-76i assault gun. The former was not well-designed and was only built in very small numbers, with most not seeing combat action at all, while the latter was regarded as a better option of a Panzer III-based assault vehicle with a larger 75mm main gun. Aside from these locally designed variants of the Panzer III, the Soviets primarily tended to use them as their basic tank version, mainly used as second-line tanks, for reconnaissance and as mobile command posts.

The Japanese government bought two Panzer IIIs from their German allies during the war (one 50 mm and one 75 mm). Purportedly this was for reverse engineering purposes, since Japan put more emphasis on the development of new military aircraft and naval technology and had been dependent on European influence in designing new tanks. By the time the vehicles were delivered, the Panzer III&#x27;s technology was obsolete.

==Variants and production==

*Panzer III Ausf. A - Prototype 15 ton vehicle; only 8 armed and saw service in Poland. Armed with 3.7 cm KwK 36 L/46.5 main gun and two coaxial 7.92 mm MG34 machine guns, and had a 250 PS HL 108 engine. Entered service in 1937 and taken out of service in 1940. It had a FuG 5 radio and a 360° hand-cranked turret.
*Panzer III Ausf. B - Prototype 15 ton vehicle; some saw service in Poland. Entered service in 1937 and put out of service in 1940. They were reused as a training vehicle after 1940. They had slightly thicker armour, and an eight-wheel suspension rather than the five-wheel suspension with coil springs.
*Panzer III Ausf. C - Prototype 16-ton vehicle; some saw service in Poland, but were put out of service soon after. Slightly different suspension, which used leaf springs, than previous models.
*Panzer III Ausf. D - Prototype; some saw service in Poland and Norway, but withdrawn from service soon after. Turret upgraded to 30 mm front, side and back. Hull armour remained the same. Hull rear was redesigned, and five vision slits added to the hull. Suspension slightly changed.
*Panzer III Ausf. E - Fifth version of the Panzer III with armour all-round, other than the rear of the vehicle, which increased the weight to . Suspension redesigned, switching from leaf-springs to torsion-bars, now using six larger roadwheels per side. Had a 300 PS HL 120 engine.
*Panzer III Ausf. F - improved Ausf. E, first mass-production version, late production armed with 5 cm KwK 38 L/42 main gun.
*Panzer III Ausf. G - Ausf F. with extra armour on the gun mantlet, late production armed with 5 cm KwK 38 L/42 main gun.
*Panzer III Ausf. H - 5 cm KwK 38 L/42 as standard gun. Bolt-on armour added to front and rear hull (30 mm base + 30 mm plates).
*Panzer III Ausf. I - A variant that was mentioned by Allied intelligence, but never existed. Possibly confused with the Ausf. J.
*Panzer III Ausf. J - The most common variant of the Panzer III, which served in North Africa and the Eastern Front. Hull and turret front armour increased to solid 50 mm plate. Spaced armour was placed around the gun mantlet. Some were produced with 5 cm KwK 39 L/60 gun and later redesignated Ausf. L.
*Panzer III Ausf. K - &quot;Panzerbefehlswagen&quot; command tank variant based on the Ausf. M with a modified turret. Carried actual main armament rather than a dummy gun as found on other Panzer III command versions.
*Panzer III Ausf. L - Redesignated Ausf. J equipped with long 5 cm gun, 20 mm stand-off armour plates on hull and turret front. It was also equipped with a new system for transferring heated engine coolant to another vehicle.
*Panzer III Ausf. M - Minor modifications of the ausf. L such as deep-wading exhaust and &quot;Schürzen&quot; side-armour panels.
*Panzer III Ausf. N - Infantry support tank, armed with a short-barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 37 L/24 gun. 700 were produced or re-equipped from 1942 and 1943.

==Designs based on chassis==
* Panzerbeobachtungswagen III - Forward artillery observer tank. 262 converted from older Panzer III Ausf. E to H variants.
* Bergepanzer III - In 1944, 176 Panzer IIIs were converted to armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs). Mostly issued to formations with Tiger I heavy tanks.
* Flammpanzer III Ausf. M / Panzer III (Fl) - Flamethrower tank. 100 built on new Ausf. M chassis.
* Panzerbefehlswagen III - Command tank with long-range radios. Ausf. D, E and H: variants with dummy main guns; Ausf. J and K: types armed with actual 5 cm gun.
* Sturm-Infanteriegeschütz 33B&#x27; - An infantry close-support heavy assault gun. Armed with a 15 cm sIG 33 infantry gun, total of 24 built. 12 used and lost in Stalingrad.
* Sturmgeschütz III - Assault gun/tank destroyer armed with a gun. Was the most produced German armored fighting vehicle during World War II.
* Sturmhaubitze 42 - Was an assault howitzer with thicker frontal armor and Schürzen that was armed with a modified variant of the 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzer, that was electrically fired and fitted with a muzzle brake. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945.
* The Soviet SU-76i assault gun was based on the chassis of captured German Panzer IIIs and StuG IIIs after the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943. About 201 of these vehicles, many taken from Stalingrad itself, were converted at Factory No. 37 in Sverdlovsk that same year for Red Army service by removing the turret and constructing a fixed casemate in its place, installing a S-1 tank gun (a cheaper version of the F-34 on the T-34 tank) in a limited-traverse gun mount. The armour was thick on the casemate front, in the hull front, and on the hull sides. It was issued to tank and self-propelled gun units starting in the fall of 1943, and finally withdrawn to training and testing uses in early 1944. Two SU-76is survive: one on a monument in the Ukrainian town of Sarny and a second on display in a military museum on Poklonnaya Hill in Moscow. It should not be confused with the similarly-named Soviet SU-76 assault gun series.
* Tauchpanzer III - (Dive-tank III) Some tanks were converted to amphibious tanks for Operation Sea Lion. Unusually, they were designed to be able to stay underwater rather than to float like most other similar kinds of tanks. The idea was that they would be launched near to the invasion shoreline and then drive to dry land on the sea-bottom. The tank was totally waterproofed, the exhaust was fitted with a one-way valve and air intake for the engine and the crew compartment was through a hose.
* Munitionspanzer III - Some Panzer IIIs were converted into munitions carriers/tractors from obsolete Mk III hulls, simply by removing the turret. Several examples have been photoed supplying Tiger tank units.
* Flakpanzer III

<text>Taang! Records is an independent record label with a roster of hardcore punk, punk rock, Oi!, power pop, ska, indie rock, psychedelic, and ambient artists and bands founded by Curtis Casella in Boston, Massachusetts in 1983.

== History ==
Taang! Records began as a singles-only label, recording acts in Boston&#x27;s early hardcore and punk scene such as Gang Green, Negative FX, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and The Lemonheads. The name is an acronym for the phrase &quot;Teen Agers Are No Good!&quot; The label gained prominence with the rise of Boston hardcore in the punk culture of the 1980s which had strong ties to the scene in nearby Washington D.C. Additionally, popularity of the 45 rpm format in the punk and indie underground scene, and the network of independent distribution, zines, retail outlets, and college radio stations that had already developed around the format also contributed to the label&#x27;s success. By the early 1990s, the label developed close ties to the punk scene in Southern California and moved its headquarters to San Diego, where it remains. Today, the Taang! catalogue includes over 200 releases in multiple formats, with international distribution.

=== 1983-1993 ===
Curtis Casella, a Boston native, started Taang! to promote the burgeoning Boston hardcore punk scene. “In the early 80&#x27;s, frustrated with the scene in Boston with all the greatest bands in the USA I felt that there should a place they could call home. No one else was doing it. Washington, DC had Dischord, UK. had No Future, Clay &amp; Secret and Crass, LA had SST, Boston needed Taang!&quot; The label&#x27;s first full-length release was Negative FX&#x27;s self-titled album, which was recorded in 1982.

In 1986, Taang! released five vinyl titles: &quot;Burning in Water&quot; by Moving Targets, &quot;Back on the Map&quot; by Slapshot, &quot;Another Wasted Night&quot; by Gang Green, the 7-inch &quot;Mine Caroline&quot; by The Oysters, and a bonus 7-inch by The Lemonheads. Gang Green&#x27;s &quot;Another Wasted Night&quot; spawned three videos that received MTV play, and their non-stop tour propelled sales of their release to upwards of 30,000 units. The label achieved wide airplay on college radio stations with releases from The Lemonheads and Bullet LaVolta, and expanded its repertoire to include acts with a more diverse sound such as Poison Idea, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Swirlies and Spacemen 3.

In 1992, Taang! produced an archival release of early material from San Diego hardcore band Battalion of Saints. Casella, who had been dividing his time between Los Angeles and Boston, moved the label&#x27;s headquarters to Mission Beach, San Diego and simultaneously opened a retail outlet in Hollywood. Shortly after moving to San Diego, Taang! issued two releases by local ska band Buck-O-Nine (the album &quot;Barfly&quot; and the EP &quot;Water In My Head&quot;), which was spurred on by a national tour in support of the ska band The Specials.

=== 1994-1999===
In the mid- to late 1990s, there were no new signings and the label focused primarily on archival releases by bands such as: Cock Sparrer (four releases), The Adicts (three releases), The Business (seven releases), The Exploited (two releases), The Boys (two releases), Last Resort, The Ruts, Slaughter and The Dogs, and Stiff Little Fingers (two releases), a total of twenty-six releases over five years.

=== 2001-2006 ===
While operating in California, the label continued its focus on Boston-based bands.
Full catalogue releases were produced for the Proletariat, Bruisers and The F.U.s. Bands such as Gang Green, Slapshot and Poison Idea, which had previously left Taang! for other labels returned, each producing new releases for the label.

=== 2007-2012 ===
In 2007, the label started to sign more new bands, including Everybody Out!, featuring Rick Barton of Dropkick Murphys, Bill Close of The Freeze and Sweeney Todd of The Dead Pets as well as Southern California&#x27;s Evacuate, led by Mike Virus of Cheap Sex and The Virus, who released their debut in 2009. Taang! also released a DVD from Cheap Sex from San Diego.

An addition to the label in this period was Negative Approach. Marking the label&#x27;s 200th release was their work &quot;Friends of No One&quot;, a lost six-song recording from 1984 that was discovered in 2009 in a basement in Detroit. Taang!&#x27;s next released &quot;Nothing Will Stand In Our Way,&quot; a full album by the band, which focused on its earliest recordings (a total of 53 songs). This record represented the first ever performance studio session practice as well as club show with the earliest photos of the band. In 2011 the label released works by two legendary bands from the San Francisco Bay area – Attitude Adjustment and Part Time Christians. Both releases contained the bands&#x27; complete recorded works and were released digitally as well as on vinyl editions. Attitude Adjustment released a new recording entitled &quot;No Way Back&quot; in 2012.

=== 2013-present ===
In 2013, the label announced plans to release a series of more than fifty vinyl records from its catalogue over the span of 10 years. In April 2014, the label released &quot;The First 10 Singles 1984-88, 7&quot; Vinyl Box Set&quot; to celebrate the Boston-based punk label&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Included in the box set were ten seven-inch discs. Each disc included a full re-creation of the original jacket except for the Oysters which was redone for this box set. There was also a 26-song CD that combined all of the musical selections. This vinyl boxset was limited to 2,000 numbered copies. The bands featured were Gang Green, Last Rights, Stranglehold, Noonday, Underground, Last Stand, Negative FX, Oysters, Lemonheads, Moving Targets, and Slapshot. There are plans to release the singles box set as an LP version as well as a CD in 2021.

<doc id="241221" wikidata="Q121399" url="?curid=241221" title="Level of service (transportation)">
<text>Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure used to relate the quality of motor vehicle traffic service. LOS is used to analyze roadways and intersections by categorizing traffic flow and assigning quality levels of traffic based on performance measure like vehicle speed, density, congestion, etc. In a more general sense, levels of service can apply to all services in asset management domain.

==Level-of-Service in the United States of America==
The following section pertains to only North American highway LOS standards as in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) and AASHTO Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (&quot;Green Book&quot;), using letters A through F, with A being the best and F being the worst, similar to academic grading.

A: free flow. Traffic flows at or above the posted speed limit and motorists have complete mobility between lanes. The average spacing between vehicles is about 550 ft(167m) or 27 car lengths. Motorists have a high level of physical and psychological comfort. The effects of incidents or point breakdowns are easily absorbed. LOS A generally occurs late at night in urban areas and frequently in rural areas.

B: reasonably free flow. LOS A speeds are maintained, maneuverability within the traffic stream is slightly restricted. The lowest average vehicle spacing is about 330 ft(100 m) or 16 car lengths. Motorists still have a high level of physical and psychological comfort.

C: stable flow, at or near free flow. The ability to maneuver through lanes is noticeably restricted and lane changes require more driver awareness. Minimum vehicle spacing is about 220 ft(67 m) or 11 car lengths. Most experienced drivers are comfortable, roads remain safely below but efficiently close to capacity, and posted speed is maintained. Minor incidents may still have no effect but localized service will have noticeable effects and traffic delays will form behind the incident. This is the target LOS for some urban and most rural highways.

D: approaching unstable flow. Speeds slightly decrease as traffic volume slightly increases. Freedom to maneuver within the traffic stream is much more limited and driver comfort levels decrease. Vehicles are spaced about 160 ft(50m) or 8 car lengths. Minor incidents are expected to create delays. Examples are a busy shopping corridor in the middle of a weekday, or a functional urban highway during commuting hours. It is a common goal for urban streets during peak hours, as attaining LOS C would require prohibitive cost and societal impact in bypass roads and lane additions.

E: unstable flow, operating at capacity. Flow becomes irregular and speed varies rapidly because there are virtually no usable gaps to maneuver in the traffic stream and speeds rarely reach the posted limit. Vehicle spacing is about 6 car lengths, but speeds are still at or above 50 mi/h(80 km/h). Any disruption to traffic flow, such as merging ramp traffic or lane changes, will create a shock wave affecting traffic upstream. Any incident will create serious delays. Drivers&#x27; level of comfort becomes poor. This is a common standard in larger urban areas, where some roadway congestion is inevitable.

F: forced or breakdown flow. Every vehicle moves in lockstep with the vehicle in front of it, with frequent slowing required. Travel time cannot be predicted, with generally more demand than capacity. A road in a constant traffic jam is at this LOS, because LOS is an average or typical service rather than a constant state. For example, a highway might be at LOS D for the AM peak hour, but have traffic consistent with LOS C some days, LOS E or F others, and come to a halt once every few weeks.

Most design or planning efforts typically use service flow rates at LOS C or D, to ensure an acceptable operating service for facility users.

===Multimodal LOS===
The 2010 HCM incorporates tools for multimodal analysis of urban streets to encourage users to consider the needs of all travelers. Stand-alone chapters for the bicycle, pedestrian, and transit have been eliminated, and methods applicable to them have been incorporated into the analyses of the various roadway facilities.

The primary basis for the new multimodal procedures is NCHRP Report 616: Multimodal Level of Service Analysis for Urban Streets. This research developed and calibrated a method for evaluating the multimodal LOS (MMLOS) provided by different urban street designs and operations. This method is designed for evaluating “complete streets,” context-sensitive design alternatives, and smart growth from the perspective of all users of the street. It is used to evaluate the tradeoffs of various street designs in terms of their effects on the perception of auto drivers, transit passengers, bicyclists, and pedestrians of the quality of service provided by the street.

===LOS for At-Grade Intersections===
The HCM defines LOS for signalized and unsignalized intersections as a function of the average vehicle control delay. LOS may be calculated per movement or per approach for any intersection configuration, but LOS for the intersection as a whole is only defined for signalized and all-way stop configurations.
When analyzing unsignalized intersections that are not all-way stop-controlled, each possible movement is considered individually. Each movement has a rank. &quot;Rank 1&quot; movements have priority over &quot;rank 2&quot; movements, and so on. The rank of each movement is as follows, with the &quot;major road&quot; being the road whose through movement moves freely, the &quot;minor road&quot; being controlled by stop signs. As for vehicular movements that conflict with pedestrian movements of the same rank, pedestrians have priority:
# through movements on the major road, parallel pedestrian movements, and right turns from the major road. LOS for movements of this rank is trivial, because LOS is determined by control delay. These are &quot;free&quot; movements, and the control delay is always zero.
# includes left turns from the major road.
# includes through movements on the minor road, parallel pedestrian movements, and right turns from the minor road.
# includes left turns from the minor road.
Movements are analyzed in order of rank, and any capacity that is left over from one rank devolves onto the next rank. Because of this pecking order, depending on intersection volumes there may be no capacity for lower-ranked movements.

====Modern Roundabouts====
The 2000 HCM provides skeleton coverage of modern roundabouts, but does not define LOS: the measure of effectiveness is the quotient of the volume to the capacity. A &quot;modern roundabout&quot; in the United States is a roundabout in which traffic inside the circle always has priority. Entering traffic is controlled by a yield sign.

===LOS in other Transportation Network Elements===
Performance of other transportation network elements can also be communicated by LOS. Among them are:
* Two-lane roadways (uninterrupted flow)
* Multilane roadways (4 or more lanes) (uninterrupted flow)
* Open freeway segments
* Freeway entrances (merges), exits (diverges), and weaving lanes
* Bicycle facilities (measure of effectiveness: events per hour; events include meeting an oncoming bicyclist or overtaking a bicyclist traveling in the same direction)
* Pedestrian facilities (HCM measure of effectiveness: pedestrians per unit area)

===Theoretical Considerations===
The LOS concept was first developed for highways in an era of rapid expansion in the use and availability of the private motor car. The primary concern was congestion, and it was commonly held that only the rapid expansion of the freeway network would keep congestion in check.

Since then, some professors in urban planning schools have proposed measurements of LOS that take public transportation into account. Such systems would include wait time, frequency of service, time it takes to pay fares, quality of the ride, accessibility of depots, and perhaps other criteria.

LOS can also be applied to surface streets, to describe major signalized intersections. A crowded four-way intersection where the major traffic movements were conflicting turns might have an LOS D or E. At intersections, queuing time can be used as a rubric to measure LOS; computer models given the full movement data can spit out a good estimate of LOS.

While it may be tempting to aim for an LOS A, this is unrealistic in urban areas. Urban areas more typically adopt standards varying between C and E, depending on the area&#x27;s size and characteristics, while F is sometimes allowed in areas with improved pedestrian, bicycle, or transit alternatives. More stringent LOS standards (particularly in urban areas) tend to necessitate the widening of roads to accommodate development, thus discouraging use by these alternatives. Because of this, some planners recommend increasing population density in towns, narrowing streets, managing car use in some areas, providing sidewalks and safe pedestrian and bicycle facilities, and making the scenery interesting for pedestrians.

An LOS standard has been developed by John J. Fruin for pedestrian facilities. The standard uses American units and applies to pedestrian queues, walkways, and stairwells. This standard is not considered a good measure of pedestrian facilities by the planning or engineering professions, because it rates undesirable (and hence unused) sidewalks with an LOS A, while pedestrians tend to prefer active, interesting sidewalks, where people prefer to walk (but rate a worse LOS on this scale). To rectify this and other issues, The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) is conducting a project to enhance methods to determine LOS for automobiles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians on urban streets, with particular consideration to intermodal interactions. Similarly, Transport for London&#x27;s &quot;Pedestrian Comfort Guidance for London&quot; (2010/2019) &quot;goes further than existing measures such as Fruin Level of Service which simply assess crowding. [The London guidance] is based on comfort and takes into account user perceptions as well as observed behaviours&quot;.

The A to F scale deals only with delays and service reliability. These delays are typically caused by congestion, breakdowns or infrequent service. It assumes there is a service in place that people can use. It also implies that poor LOS can be solved by increased capacity such as additional lanes or overcoming bottlenecks, and in the case of transit, more buses or trains. It does not deal for instance with cases where there is no bridge across a river, no bus or train service, no sidewalks, or no bike-lanes.

An expanded LOS might look like:
0 - No service exists. Latent demand may exist.
1 - Service is poor, unsafe or discouraging. Demand is suppressed below socially desirable levels.
A-F - As per existing LOS scale.
G - Further expansion of capacity is limited.
H - No expansion is possible. Radical or innovative solutions are required

==LOS in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland==

The LOS measure is much more suited to American roads than roads in Europe and the UK, but the HCM is used. The technique is in UK textbooks but is sparingly used. The individual countries of the UK have different bodies for each area&#x27;s roads, and detailed techniques and applications vary in Scotland, England and Wales, but in general the practice is the same.

Rural and urban roads are in general much busier than in the U.S, and service levels tend to be to the higher end of the scale, especially in peak commuting periods. It is acceptable for roads to operate at 85% capacity, which equates to LOS D and E.

In general, the principle is to take the volume of traffic in one hour and divide by the appropriate capacity of the road type to get a v/c rating, which can be cross-referenced to the textbooks with tables of v/c ratings and their equivalent LOS ratings. The lack of definitive categories towards LOS D, E and F limit the use, like a D or E category on an urban road, would be acceptable.

In certain circumstances, the UK shortens the LOS categories to just A-D. A and B indicate free-movement of traffic (i.e. under 85% capacity), C reaching capacity 85%-100%, D over capacity. Little reference to this can be found in textbooks and it may just be an &#x27;unwritten engineering practice&#x27;, agreed with certain authorities.

==LOS in the Commonwealth of Australia==
In Australia LOS are an integral component of Asset Management Plans, defined as the service quality for a given activity. LOS are often documented as a commitment to carry out a given action or actions within a specified time frame in response to an event or asset condition data.

Refer Austroads Guide to Traffic Management Part 3 for a comprehensive explanation.

<text>In materials science and solid mechanics, Poisson&#x27;s ratio (symbol:  (nu)) is a measure of the Poisson effect, the deformation (expansion or contraction) of a material in directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading. The value of Poisson&#x27;s ratio is the negative of the ratio of transverse strain to axial strain. For small values of these changes, is the amount of transversal elongation divided by the amount of axial compression. Most materials have Poisson&#x27;s ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. For soft materials, such as rubber, where the bulk modulus is much higher than the shear modulus, Poisson&#x27;s ratio is near 0.5. For open-cell polymer foams, Poisson&#x27;s ratio is near zero, since the cells tend to collapse in compression. Many typical solids have Poisson&#x27;s ratios in the range of 0.2 to 0.3. The ratio is named after the French mathematician and physicist Siméon Poisson.

==Origin==
Poisson&#x27;s ratio is a measure of the Poisson effect, the phenomenon in which a material tends to expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression. Conversely, if the material is stretched rather than compressed, it usually tends to contract in the directions transverse to the direction of stretching. It is a common observation when a rubber band is stretched, it becomes noticeably thinner. Again, the Poisson ratio will be the ratio of relative contraction to relative expansion and will have the same value as above. In certain rare cases, a material will actually shrink in the transverse direction when compressed (or expand when stretched) which will yield a negative value of the Poisson ratio.

The Poisson&#x27;s ratio of a stable, isotropic, linear elastic material must be between −1.0 and +0.5 because of the requirement for Young&#x27;s modulus, the shear modulus and bulk modulus to have positive values. Most materials have Poisson&#x27;s ratio values ranging between 0.0 and 0.5. A perfectly incompressible isotropic material deformed elastically at small strains would have a Poisson&#x27;s ratio of exactly 0.5. Most steels and rigid polymers when used within their design limits (before yield) exhibit values of about 0.3, increasing to 0.5 for post-yield deformation which occurs largely at constant volume. Rubber has a Poisson ratio of nearly 0.5. Cork&#x27;s Poisson ratio is close to 0, showing very little lateral expansion when compressed. Glass is between 0.18 and 0.30. Some materials, e.g. some polymer foams, origami folds, and certain cells can exhibit negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio, and are referred to as auxetic materials. If these auxetic materials are stretched in one direction, they become thicker in the perpendicular direction. In contrast, some anisotropic materials, such as carbon nanotubes, zigzag-based folded sheet materials, and honeycomb auxetic metamaterials to name a few, can exhibit one or more Poisson&#x27;s ratios above 0.5 in certain directions.

Assuming that the material is stretched or compressed in only one direction (the axis in the diagram below):
:formula_1
where
* is the resulting Poisson&#x27;s ratio,
* is transverse strain
* is axial strain
and positive strain indicates extension and negative strain indicates contraction.

==Poisson&#x27;s ratio from geometry changes==
=== Length change ===

For a cube stretched in the -direction (see Figure 1) with a length increase of in the -direction, and a length decrease of in the - and -directions, the infinitesimal diagonal strains are given by
:formula_2

If Poisson&#x27;s ratio is constant through deformation, integrating these expressions and using the definition of Poisson&#x27;s ratio gives
:formula_3

Solving and exponentiating, the relationship between and is then
:formula_4

For very small values of and , the first-order approximation yields:
:formula_5

=== Volumetric change ===

The relative change of volume of a cube due to the stretch of the material can now be calculated. Since and
:formula_6

one can derive
:formula_7

Using the above derived relationship between and :
:formula_8

and for very small values of and , the first-order approximation yields:
:formula_9

For isotropic materials we can use Lamé&#x27;s relation
:formula_10
where is bulk modulus and is Young&#x27;s modulus.

=== Width change ===
If a rod with diameter (or width, or thickness) and length is subject to tension so that its length will change by then its diameter will change by:
:formula_11

The above formula is true only in the case of small deformations; if deformations are large then the following (more precise) formula can be used:
:formula_12
where
* is original diameter
* is rod diameter change
* is Poisson&#x27;s ratio
* is original length, before stretch
* is the change of length.

The value is negative because it decreases with increase of length

== Characteristic materials ==
=== Isotropic ===

For a linear isotropic material subjected only to compressive (i.e. normal) forces, the deformation of a material in the direction of one axis will produce a deformation of the material along the other axis in three dimensions. Thus it is possible to generalize Hooke&#x27;s Law (for compressive forces) into three dimensions:
:formula_13

where:
*, , and are strain in the direction of , and 
*, , and are stress in the direction of , and 
* is Young&#x27;s modulus (the same in all directions for isotropic materials)
* is Poisson&#x27;s ratio (the same in all directions for isotropic materials)

these equations can be all synthesized in the following:
:formula_14

In the most general case, also shear stresses will hold as well as normal stresses, and the full generalization of Hooke&#x27;s law is given by:
:formula_15
where is the Kronecker delta. The Einstein notation is usually adopted:
:formula_16
to write the equation simply as:
:formula_17

=== Anisotropic ===
For anisotropic materials, the Poisson ratio depends on the direction of extension and transverse deformation
:formula_18

Here is Poisson&#x27;s ratio, is Young&#x27;s modulus, is a unit vector directed along the direction of extension, is a unit vector directed perpendicular to the direction of extension. Poisson&#x27;s ratio has a different number of special directions depending on the type of anisotropy.

=== Orthotropic ===

Orthotropic materials have three mutually perpendicular planes of symmetry in their material properties. An example is wood, which is most stiff (and strong) along the grain, and less so in the other directions.

Then Hooke&#x27;s law can be expressed in matrix form as
:formula_19
where
* is the Young&#x27;s modulus along axis 
* is the shear modulus in direction on the plane whose normal is in direction 
* is the Poisson ratio that corresponds to a contraction in direction when an extension is applied in direction .

The Poisson ratio of an orthotropic material is different in each direction (, and ). However, the symmetry of the stress and strain tensors implies that not all the six Poisson&#x27;s ratios in the equation are independent. There are only nine independent material properties: three elastic moduli, three shear moduli, and three Poisson&#x27;s ratios. The remaining three Poisson&#x27;s ratios can be obtained from the relations
:formula_20

From the above relations we can see that if then . The larger ratio (in this case ) is called the major Poisson ratio while the smaller one (in this case ) is called the minor Poisson ratio. We can find similar relations between the other Poisson ratios.
=== Transversely isotropic ===
Transversely isotropic materials have a plane of isotropy in which the elastic properties are isotropic. If we assume that this plane of isotropy is the -plane, then Hooke&#x27;s law takes the form
:formula_21
where we have used the -plane of isotropy to reduce the number of constants, that is,
:formula_22.

The symmetry of the stress and strain tensors implies that
:formula_23
This leaves us with six independent constants , , , , , . However, transverse isotropy gives rise to a further constraint between and , which is
:formula_24
Therefore, there are five independent elastic material properties two of which are Poisson&#x27;s ratios. For the assumed plane of symmetry, the larger of and is the major Poisson ratio. The other major and minor Poisson ratios are equal.

== Poisson&#x27;s ratio values for different materials ==


=== Negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio materials ===

Some materials known as auxetic materials display a negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio. When subjected to positive strain in a longitudinal axis, the transverse strain in the material will actually be positive (i.e. it would increase the cross sectional area). For these materials, it is usually due to uniquely oriented, hinged molecular bonds. In order for these bonds to stretch in the longitudinal direction, the hinges must ‘open’ in the transverse direction, effectively exhibiting a positive strain.
This can also be done in a structured way and lead to new aspects in material design as for mechanical metamaterials.

Studies have shown that certain solid wood types display negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio exclusively during a compression creep test. Initially, the compression creep test shows positive Poisson&#x27;s ratios, but gradually decreases until it reaches negative values. Consequently, this also shows that Poisson&#x27;s ratio for wood is time-dependent during constant loading, meaning that the strain in the axial and transverse direction do not increase in the same rate.

Media with engineered microstructure may exhibit negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio. In a simple case auxeticity is obtained removing material and creating a periodic porous media. Lattices can reach lower values of Poisson&#x27;s ratio, which can be indefinitely close to the limiting value −1 in the isotropic case.

More than three hundred crystalline materials have negative Poisson&#x27;s ratio. For example, Li, Na, K, Cu, Rb, Ag, Fe, Ni, Co, Cs, Au, Be, Ca, Zn Sr, Sb, MoS2 and others.

== Poisson function ==

At finite strains, the relationship between the transverse and axial strains and is typically not well described by the Poisson ratio. In fact, the Poisson ratio is often considered a function of the applied strain in the large strain regime. In such instances, the Poisson ratio is replaced by the Poisson function, for which there are several competing definitions. Defining the transverse stretch and axial stretch , where the transverse stretch is a function of the axial stretch, the most common are the Hencky, Biot, Green, and Almansi functions:

:formula_25

== Applications of Poisson&#x27;s effect ==

One area in which Poisson&#x27;s effect has a considerable influence is in pressurized pipe flow. When the air or liquid inside a pipe is highly pressurized it exerts a uniform force on the inside of the pipe, resulting in a hoop stress within the pipe material. Due to Poisson&#x27;s effect, this hoop stress will cause the pipe to increase in diameter and slightly decrease in length. The decrease in length, in particular, can have a noticeable effect upon the pipe joints, as the effect will accumulate for each section of pipe joined in series. A restrained joint may be pulled apart or otherwise prone to failure.

Another area of application for Poisson&#x27;s effect is in the realm of structural geology. Rocks, like most materials, are subject to Poisson&#x27;s effect while under stress. In a geological timescale, excessive erosion or sedimentation of Earth&#x27;s crust can either create or remove large vertical stresses upon the underlying rock. This rock will expand or contract in the vertical direction as a direct result of the applied stress, and it will also deform in the horizontal direction as a result of Poisson&#x27;s effect. This change in strain in the horizontal direction can affect or form joints and dormant stresses in the rock.

Although cork was historically chosen to seal wine bottle for other reasons (including its inert nature, impermeability, flexibility, sealing ability, and resilience), cork&#x27;s Poisson&#x27;s ratio of zero provides another advantage. As the cork is inserted into the bottle, the upper part which is not yet inserted does not expand in diameter as it is compressed axially. The force needed to insert a cork into a bottle arises only from the friction between the cork and the bottle due to the radial compression of the cork. If the stopper were made of rubber, for example, (with a Poisson&#x27;s ratio of about +0.5), there would be a relatively large additional force required to overcome the radial expansion of the upper part of the rubber stopper.

Most car mechanics are aware that it is hard to pull a rubber hose (such as a coolant hose) off a metal pipe stub, as the tension of pulling causes the diameter of the hose to shrink, gripping the stub tightly. (This is the same effect as shown in a Chinese finger trap.) Hoses can more easily be pushed off stubs instead using a wide flat blade.

<text>Harry Benjamin (January 12, 1885 – August 24, 1986) was a German-American endocrinologist and sexologist, widely known for his clinical work with transgender people.

== Early life and career ==
Benjamin was born in Berlin, and raised in a German Lutheran home. His mother was German and his father at least part-Jewish in ancestry. He joined a regiment of the Prussian Guard. He received his doctorate in medicine in 1912 in Tübingen for a dissertation on tuberculosis. Sexual medicine interested him, but was not part of his medical studies. In a 1985 interview he recalled:

Benjamin visited the United States in 1913, to work with a quack doctor who claimed to have found a cure for tuberculosis. The liner in which Benjamin was returning to Germany was caught mid-Atlantic both by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the Royal Navy. Given the choice of a British internment camp, as an &quot;enemy alien&quot;, or returning to New York, he used his last dollars to travel back to America, where he made his home for the rest of his life. However, he maintained and built many international professional connections and visited Europe frequently when wars allowed.

After several failed attempts to start a medical career in New York, in 1915 Benjamin rented a consulting room, in which he also slept, and started his own general medical practice. In 1937 he moved his practice to a ground floor office suite at 728 Park Avenue in Manhattan, then briefly to 125 East 72nd Street in 1957, and sometime between 1959 and 1962 he moved his practice again to 44 East 67th Street before finally relocating to 1045 Park Avenue in 1963 where he continued to practice until his retirement in 1968. Sometime before 1948, he also began maintaining an office in San Francisco where he practiced during the summer of every year (at 450 Sutter Street, Suite 2232), with many of his patients coming from the nearby Tenderloin neighborhood).

== Work with transgender people ==
Prior to arriving in the United States, Benjamin studied at the &quot;Institut für Sexualwissenschaft&quot;; from about this time onward he began to encounter and treat patients who he would later describe as transsexuals. In the 1930s he studied in Austria with Eugen Steinach. In 1948, in San Francisco, Benjamin was asked by Alfred Kinsey, a fellow sexologist, to see a young patient who was anatomically male but insisted on being female. Kinsey had encountered the child as a result of his interviews for &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;, which was published that year. This case rapidly caused Benjamin&#x27;s interest in what he would come to call transsexualism, realizing that there was a different condition to that of transvestism, under which adults who had such needs had been classified to that time.

Despite the psychiatrists Benjamin involved in the case not agreeing on a path of treatment, Benjamin eventually decided to treat the child with estrogen (Premarin, introduced in 1941), which had a &quot;calming effect&quot;, and helped arrange for the mother and child to go to Germany, where surgery to assist the child could be performed but, from there, they ceased to maintain contact, to Benjamin&#x27;s regret. However, Benjamin continued to refine his understanding and went on to treat several hundred patients with similar needs in a similar manner, often without accepting any payment.

Many of his patients were referred by David Cauldwell, Robert Stoller, and doctors in Denmark. These doctors received hundreds of requests from individuals who had read about their work connected with changing sex, as it was then largely described.

However, due to the personal political opinions of the American doctors and a Danish law prohibiting sex reassignment surgery on noncitizens, these doctors referred the letter-writers to the one doctor of the era who would aid transsexual individuals, Harry Benjamin. Benjamin conducted treatment with the assistance of carefully selected colleagues of various disciplines (such as psychiatrists C. L. Ihlenfeld and John Alden, electrologist Martha Foss, and surgeons Jose Jesus Barbosa, Roberto C. Granato, and Georges Burou).

Benjamin&#x27;s patients regarded him as a man of immense caring, respect and kindness, and many kept in touch with him until his death. He was a prolific and assiduous correspondent, in both English and German, and many letters are archived at the Magnus Hirschfeld Archive for Sexology, Humboldt University, Berlin.

The legal, social and medical background to this in the United States, as in many other countries, was often a stark contrast, since wearing items of clothing associated with the opposite sex in public was often illegal, anything seen as homosexuality was often persecuted or illegal, and many doctors considered all such people (including children) at best denied any affirmation of their gender identity, or involuntarily subjected to treatments such as drugged detention, electroconvulsive therapy, or lobotomy..

Though he had already published papers and lectured to professional audiences extensively, Benjamin&#x27;s 1966 book, &quot;The Transsexual Phenomenon&quot;, was especially important as the first large work describing and explaining the affirmative treatment path he pioneered. Publicity surrounding his patient Christine Jorgensen brought the issue into the mainstream in 1952 and led to a great many people presenting for assistance, internationally. In the preface of Christine Jorgensen&#x27;s autobiography, Dr. Benjamin also gives Jorgensen credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote, &quot;Indeed Christine, without you, probably none of this would have happened; the grant, my publications, lectures, etc.&quot;

Similar cases in other countries (such as that of Roberta Cowell, whose surgery by Harold Gillies in England was in 1951 but was not publicised until 1954; Coccinelle who received much publicity in France in 1958, and April Ashley, whose exposure in 1961 by the British tabloid press was reported worldwide) fuelled this. But most of Benjamin&#x27;s patients lived (and many still live) quiet lives.

Reed Erickson (1917–1992), a successful industrialist, sought treatment from Benjamin in 1963. Erickson was the founder and funder of the Erickson Educational Foundation, which published educational booklets, funded medical conferences, counselling services, and the establishment of gender clinics. The EEF funded the Harry Benjamin Foundation.

== Other work and interests ==
Apart from endocrinology and sexology, he worked on life extension and now would be described as a gerontologist. Benjamin lived to be 101.

Benjamin dedicated his 1966 major work to Gretchen. They were married for 60 years. They were married December 23, 1925. Gretchen revealed to Charles L. Ihlenfeld that &quot;about six months after they were married Harry brought his mother from Germany to live with them&quot; and that &quot;from then on their bedroom door remained open&quot;.

In 1979, the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association was formed, using Benjamin&#x27;s name by permission. The group consists of therapists and psychologists who devised a set of Standards of Care (SOC) for the treatment of gender dysphoria, largely based on Benjamin&#x27;s cases, and studies. It later changed its name to The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).

<text>The World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), formerly the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA), is a professional organization devoted to the understanding and treatment of gender identity and gender dysphoria, and creating standardized treatment for transgender and gender variant people. WPATH was founded in 1979 and named HBIGDA in honor of Harry Benjamin during a period where there was no clinical consensus on how and when to provide gender-affirming care.

Founding members included Dr. Harry Benjamin, Paul A. Walker, Richard Green, Jack C. Berger, Donald R. Laub, Charles L. Reynolds Jr., Leo Wollman and Jude Patton.

WPATH is mostly known for the Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC). Early versions of the SOC mandated strict gatekeeping of transition by psychologists and psychiatrists and framed transgender identity as a mental illness. Beginning in approximately 2010, WPATH began publicly advocating the depsychopathologization of transgender identities and the 7th and 8th versions of the SOC took an approach that was more evidence-based.

== Standards of Care ==

WPATH develops, publishes and reviews guidelines for persons with gender dysphoria, under the name of Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, the overall goal of the SOC is to provide clinical guidance for health professionals to assist transgender, and gender nonconforming people with safe and effective pathways to achieving lasting personal comfort with their gendered selves, in order to maximize their overall health, psychological well-being, and self-fulfillment. To keep up with increasing scientific evidence, WPATH periodically commissions an update to the Standards of Care and the WPATH Guideline Steering Committee oversees the guideline development process. The first version of the Standards of Care were published in 1979. Versions were released in 1979 (1st), 1980 (2nd), 1981 (3rd), 1990 (4th), 1998 (5th), 2001 (6th), and 2012 (7th). WPATH released Version 8, the latest edition, in 2022; it is described as being based upon a &quot;more rigorous and methodological evidence-based approach than previous versions.&quot;

SOC is an internationally accepted and influential document outlining how to provide patients with transition related care. Early versions of the SOC focused gender transition towards psychologists and psychiatrists and framed transgender identity as a mental illness. Beginning in approximately 2010, with pushing from trans activists the WPATH began publicly advocating the depsychopathologization of transgender identities in the 7th version of the SOC.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Medical treatment for gender dysphoria was publicized in the early 1950s by accounts such as those of Christine Jorgensen. During this period, the majority of literature on gender diversity was pathologizing, positing dysfunctional families as the causes of dysphoria and recommending reparative therapy and psychoanalysis, such as Robert Stoller&#x27;s work. Others such as George Rekers and Ole Ivar Lovaas recommended behavioral treatments to extinguish cross-sex identification and reinforce gender-normative behaviors. Knowledge on various aspects of transition related care had existed for decades, but there was no clinical consensus on the care pathways for transgender people.

In 1966, Harry Benjamin published The Transsexual Phenomenon, arguing that since there was no cure for transsexualism, it was in the best interests of transsexuals and society to aid in sex reassignment and in the same year the Johns Hopkins Gender Clinic was opened by John Money.
In 1969, Reed Erickson, a wealthy transgender man who played a large role in funding research and clinics for trans healthcare through the Erickson Educational Foundation, funded Richard Green and Money&#x27;s book Transsexualism and Sex Reassignment, a multidisciplinary volume exploring instructions on medical care as well as social and clinical aspects, which was dedicated to Benjamin. The same year, he funded the 1st International Symposium on Gender Identity in London. The 4th conference, taking place in 1975, was the first to use Benjamin&#x27;s name in the title.

=== 1979-2000 ===
The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association and Standards of Care (SOC) were conceived during the 5th International Gender Dysphoria Symposium (IGDS) in 1977. The organization was named in honor of Benjamin and supported a mixture of psychological and medical treatment. The founding committee was entirely American and consisted of Jack Berger, Richard Green, Donald R. Laub, Charles Reynolds Jr., Paul A. Walker, Leo Wollman, and transgender activist Jude Patton with Walker serving as president; The first SOC committee included all founding committee members with the exception of Patton, a vote by attendees having opposed a &quot;consumer&quot; board member. The Articles of Incorporation were approved in 1979 at the 6th IGDS and HBIGDA was legally incorporated 7 months later.

The initial Standards of Care, &quot;The hormonal and surgical sex reassignment of gender dysphoric persons&quot;, were published in 1979 and served both as clinical guidelines for treating patients and to protect those who provided the treatments. Versions 2, 3, and 4 of the SOC were published in 1980, 1981 and 1990 respectively under the same name with few changes. These versions of the SOC followed the gatekeeping model laid out by Benjamin, where clinicians set strict eligibility requirements, requiring evaluations from separate mental health professionals and compulsory psychotherapy. WPATH played a large role in the addition of &quot;Gender Identity Disorder&quot; to the DSM-III in 1980. These versions used the DSM-III&#x27;s criteria for the diagnoses of &quot;Transsexualism&quot; and &quot;Gender Identity Disorder of Childhood&quot;, which had largely been authored by Richard Green. This led to feedback loops in research where the diagnostic criteria were thought correct since transgender people provided the narratives expected of them to access care.

In the 1990s, WPATH was struggling to operate due to criticisms of their SOC in the trans community such as the requirement of the real life test, where patients had to socially transition for up to a year prior to hormones. These critiques developed into a trans-led Advocacy and Liaison committee, marking the first time trans people were officially and actively consulted regarding their treatment. The 5th version, published in 1998, was titled the &quot;Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders&quot; to be consistent with the DSM-III. It recommended but did not require psychotherapy and stated that while GID was a mental disorder, that was not a license for stigma.
=== 2001 - present ===
The Standards of Care (SOC) 6 was published in 2001 and offered more flexibility and individualized care but continued to use the phrase &quot;gender identity disorder&quot;. At the same time transgender people increasingly complained of having to &quot;jump through hoops&quot;. SOC 6 also did not include significant changes to the tasks mental health professionals were required to take or in the general recommendations for content of the letters of readiness. An important change in the eligibility criteria for GAH allowed providers to prescribe hormones even if patients had not undergone RLT or psychotherapy if it was for harm reduction purposes. A notable change in version six separated the eligibility and readiness criteria for top and bottom surgery allowing some patients, particularly individuals assigned female at birth, to receive a mastectomy.

In 2006, the organization changed its name from the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). In 2007, Stephen Whittle became the first transgender president of the organization.

In 2010, WPATH published the &quot;depath statement&quot;, urging the &quot;depsychopathologisation of gender variance worldwide&quot; by governments and medical bodies. Shortly afterwards it released the &quot;Identity Recognition Statement&quot;, urging governmental and medical bodies to endorse gender self-identification and no longer require surgery or sterilization as a prerequisite.

The SOC 7, published in 2011, was more evidence-based than the previous versions and first to include an international advisory committee of transgender community leaders. It changed the name to the &quot;Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender-Nonconforming People&quot;, began to use the phrase &quot;gender dysphoria&quot;, and marked a shift from conceiving gender as a binary to a spectrum. Differences between the 6th and the 7th versions were significant with the 7th version of the SOC including gender affirming care in female-to-male persons. The updated SOC also had a significant departure from previous versions. Including being the first version to include references, changes in guidelines where not everyone with gender concerns requires a diagnosis, replacing the requirement of the real life test and psychotherapy prior to hormone treatment or surgery with &quot;persistent well documented gender dysphoria&quot;, criteria for hysterectomy or orchiectomy treatment, and an expansion of the effects of hormone therapy. WPATH acknowledged the importance and changes in the 7th SOC saying that &quot;Changes in this version are based upon significant cultural shifts, advances in clinical knowledge, and appreciation of the many health care issues that can arise for transsexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people beyond hormone therapy and surgery&quot;.

In 2022 the current edition of the Standards of Care 8 was published. The guidelines note that the complexity of the assessment process may differ from patient to patient, based on the type of gender affirming care requested and the specific characteristics of the patient. The updates to SOC 8 shifted the ethical focus of evaluations toward one of shared decision making and informed consent by removing the requirement of a second letter from a mental health professional and the requirement that the provider must have a doctoral level degree. Changes in this edition included a shift away from requiring multiple letters from mental health professionals for surgery, introduces the term gender incongruence, and the treatment of adolescents. WPATH commissioned a series of reviews to support the development of the latest version of the Standards of Care 8 from various research organizations and retained the publishing rights to the contracted research to support the SOC 8 guidelines, which were developed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts, building on previous versions and using the Delphi method. WPATH sent an update to all SOC 8 coauthors in October 2020 stating, &quot;It is paramount that any publication based on the WPATH SOC8 data is thoroughly scrutinized and reviewed to ensure that publication does not negatively affect the provision of transgender healthcare in the broadest sense.&quot; Karen Robinson, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University, one of the contracted research organizations said that &quot;We had hoped to publish more of those reviews but for a few reasons have not done so&quot;.

<text>Eric Lansdown Trist (11 September 1909 – 4 June 1993) was an English scientist and leading figure in the field of organizational development (OD). He was one of the founders of the Tavistock Institute for Social Research in London.

==Biography==
Trist was born in 1909 in Dover, Kent, England of a Cornish father, Frederick Trist, and a Scottish mother, Alexina Trist nee Middleton. He grew up in Dover experiencing dramatic air raids in the first world war, and attended the local county school. He went to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1928, where he read English Literature, graduating with first-class honours. Influenced heavily by his don I. A. Richards he became interested in Psychology, Gestalt psychology, and Psychoanalysis, and went on to read psychology under Frederic Bartlett. At that time (1932/3) Trist has said he was very interested in articles by Kurt Lewin. When Kurt Lewin (who was Jewish) left Germany as Adolf Hitler came to power, he travelled to Palestine via the USA, stopping off in England, where Trist briefly met him and showed him around Cambridge.

Trist graduated in Psychology in 1933, with a distinction, and went to Yale University in the USA and again met Lewin, who was at Cornell University and then Iowa. He visited B. F. Skinner, a key figure in Behaviourism in Boston. After witnessing some disturbing experiences during the Depression, he became politically interested for the first time, and read Karl Marx.

Trist returned to the UK in 1935 with his first wife Virginia Traylor (b. 11 Sep 1909, m. 6 Jul 1935 Manhattan, New York) (a granddaughter of John Henry Traylor), her mother and sister. Trist met Oscar Adolph Oeser, who headed the psychology department at the [[University of St Andrews], [[Scotland]], and went on to study unemployment in [[Dundee]].

At the outbreak of the [[World War II|second world war]] Trist became a clinical [[psychologist]] at the [[Maudsley Hospital]], London, treating war casualties from [[Dunkirk]]. He recalls how, in 1940, in the [[London blitz]], &quot;some very frightened people came out of their rooms, ran all over the grounds and we had to go and find them.&quot; The Maudsley, at Mill Hill, was a teaching hospital, and Trist attended seminars and met people from the [[Tavistock Institute|Tavistock Clinic]], whom he was keen to join. Opposed by his boss, [[Sir Aubrey Lewis]], who wouldn&#x27;t let him go, he joined the Tavistock group in the army, as a way of getting free, and was replaced by [[Hans Eysenck]]. Trist went to [[Edinburgh]] and worked on the [[War Office Selection Boards|War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs)]], with [[John Derg Sutherland|Jock Sutherland]] and [[Wilfred Bion]]. For the last two years of the war, Trist was chief psychologist at the Headquarters of the [[Civil Resettlement Units]] (CRUs) for repatriated prisoners of war, working to schemes devised by [[A. T. M. Wilson|Tommy Wilson]] and Wilfred Bion. He described this as &quot;probably the most exciting single experience of my professional life&quot;.

Following the death of his first wife and marriage to Beulah J. Varney (b. 1st quarter 1925, m. 2nd quarter 1959, [[Middlesex]], England), in July 1966 Trist moved to America as Professor of Organizational Behavior and Social Ecology in the Graduate School of Business Administration at [[UCLA]]. In 1969 he joined [[Russell L. Ackoff]] in the Social Systems Science Program (S-cubed) at the [[Wharton School]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He taught there until 1978 when he became an emeritus professor. In that same year he joined the Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University, Toronto where he initiated a program in future studies and taught there until 1983.

In the 1990s Trist wrote a three-volume account of the Tavistock, along with Hugh Murray and Fred Emery, &quot;The Social Engagement of Social Science&quot;. He died on 4 June 1993 in Carmel, California. By his second wife, Beulah J. Varney, he had one son and one daughter.

== Work ==
=== Influences of Kurt Lewin ===
Trist was heavily influenced by [[Kurt Lewin]], whom he met first 1933 in Cambridge, England. Kurt Lewin had moved from studying behaviour to engineering its change, particularly in relation to racial and religious conflicts, inventing [[sensitivity training]], a technique for making people more aware of the effect they have on others, which some claim as the beginning of [[political correctness]].

This would later influence the direction of much of work at the [[Tavistock Institute]], in the direction of management and, some would say, manipulation, rather than fundamental research into human behaviour and the psyche. It was a partnership between Trist&#x27;s group at the Tavistock, and Lewin&#x27;s at [[MIT]] that launched the Journal &#x27;[[Human Relations]]&#x27; just before Lewin&#x27;s death in 1947.

=== The Tavistock group ===
It was the wartime experiences of Trist and his various associates that created what became known as &#x27;the Tavistock group&#x27;, which formed a planning committee to meet and plan the future of the Tavistock after the war. The [[Tavistock Institute of Human Relations|Tavistock Institute]] was formed, with Trist as deputy chairman, and [[Tommy Wilson (psychiatrist)|Tommy Wilson]] as chairman, with a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in February 1946, and a new [[Tavistock Clinic]] became part of the newly formed [[National Health Service]]. Many of the group went into formal [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic training]].

Trist was much influenced by [[Melanie Klein]], who visited the Tavistock, as well as by his colleagues [[John Bowlby]], [[Donald Winnicott]], [[Wilfred Bion]] and [[John Derg Sutherland|Jock Sutherland]]. Though close to Wilfred Bion during the war, Trist later wrote that he was glad he did not join Bion at this point, because &quot;he left groups in the 1950s – which flummoxed everybody – and got completely absorbed in psychoanalysis&quot;, adding, &quot;that was when the cult of Bion – a wrong cult in my view – became established.&quot; 

Trist and the Tavistock became involved in industrial projects until 1951, and was given the Lewin Award in 1951. The family discussion group was formed, and John Bowlby did his world-famous studies on mother-child separation and the establishment of [[family systems therapy]]. With cooperation and contributions from Kurt Lewin in the USA, the publication of &quot;Human Relations&quot;, the Tavistock Journal began, and Trist commented that this gave the Tavistock credibility in the USA, saying, &quot;its articles wouldn&#x27;t have been accepted by any of the other British psychological journals&quot;.

=== Organizational research ===
In 1949, his organizational research work, studying work crews in at [[Elsecar Collieries]], with Ken Bamforth, resulted in the famous article, &quot;Some Social and Psychological Consequences of the Longwall Method of Coal Getting.&quot; This article highlighted aspects of the miners organisation that today would be termed [[Lean manufacturing|lean]] or [[Agile software development|agile]].

=== Socio-technical systems ===
Trist also collaborated with [[Fred Emery]] on developing the [[socio-technical systems]] approach to [[work design]].

<text>Ian Edward Wright (born 3 November 1963) is an English television and radio personality and former professional footballer.

Wright enjoyed success with London clubs Crystal Palace and Arsenal as a forward, spending six years with the former and seven years with the latter. With Arsenal he lifted the Premier League title, both the major domestic cup competitions, and the European Cup Winners Cup. Known for his speed, agility, finishing and aggression, he played 581 league games, scoring 287 goals for seven clubs in Scotland and England, while also earning 33 caps for the England national team, and scoring nine international goals.

Wright also played in the Premier League for West Ham United, the Scottish Premier League for Celtic and the Football League for Burnley and Nottingham Forest. , he is Arsenal&#x27;s second-highest scorer of all time and Crystal Palace&#x27;s third-highest.

After retiring, he has been active in the media, usually in football-related TV and radio shows. Two of his sons, Bradley and Shaun, are retired professional footballers.

==Early life==
Wright is the third son of Jamaican parents. His father was absent from a young age, and he was brought up by his mother, Nesta, and an abusive stepfather.

Wright came to professional football relatively late. Despite having had trials at Southend United and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion during his teens, he was unable to attract sufficient interest to win a professional contract offer. Reverting to playing for amateur and non-League teams, he was left disillusioned about his chances of a career as a professional footballer.

After a spell of poverty during which his wife was expecting their first child, Wright spent 32 days in Chelmsford Prison for failing to pay fines for driving without tax or insurance. He recalls that after being locked in the cell, he burst into tears and vowed to God to do everything in his power to make it as a footballer.

Wright described his teacher Sydney Pigden as &quot;the first positive male figure that I had in my life&quot;. Having believed for years that Pigden had died, Wright was reunited with his former mentor in a 2005 episode of the BBC programme &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;.

Growing up, Wright had an affinity for several London clubs. In his autobiography, he describes Millwall as &quot;the first football team I fell in love with&quot; and writes that he &quot;genuinely had loved West Ham&quot; since he was young, with their kit being the first he owned. He also had an early connection with Arsenal, as he was close friends with club legend David Rocastle.

==Club career==
===Amateur and semi-professional===
From being a teenager, until the age of 21, Wright played for Lewisham-based amateur Sunday league club Ten-em-Bee (a club his sons Brett and Shaun also later played for) becoming the top scorer in the London and Kent Border Sunday League. In 1985 Wright was signed by semi-professional Greenwich Borough and got paid £30 a week.

===Crystal Palace===
After six or seven matches at Greenwich, Wright was spotted by a Crystal Palace scout after a tip-off from Dulwich Hamlet manager Billy Smith and was invited for a trial at Selhurst Park. Having impressed then-manager Steve Coppell, he signed a professional contract with Palace in August 1985, just three months short of his 22nd birthday, the agreed fee being a set of weightlifting equipment.

He quickly made his mark in his first season, scoring nine goals to finish as Palace&#x27;s second-highest scorer. When Mark Bright arrived on the Palace scene the following year the duo soon established a successful striking partnership and it was largely their goals which took the club back to the top flight via the playoffs in 1989. Wright was particularly instrumental that season, scoring 24 goals in the Second Division and a total of 33 in all competitions.

Wright was called up for England B duty in December 1989 but a twice-cracked shin bone reduced his initial impact in the First Division. However, after recovering from the injury he made a dramatic appearance as a &#x27;super-sub&#x27;, in the 1990 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. He equalised for Palace a few minutes after coming onto the field forcing extra time, then putting them ahead in extra time. The eventual score was 3–3, but Palace lost the replay 1–0.

The next season, he gained full international honours, and reached a hundred goals for Crystal Palace, as the club finished in their highest ever league position of third place in the top flight. He also scored twice as Palace beat Everton to win the Full Members Cup at Wembley. Wright became renowned for his deadly striking ability, as shown when he scored a hat-trick in just eighteen minutes in Palace&#x27;s penultimate game of the 1990–91 season away to Wimbledon.

Wright scored 117 goals in 253 starts and 24 substitute appearances over six seasons for The Eagles in all competitions, making him the club&#x27;s record post-war goalscorer and third on the all-time list.
In 2005, he was voted into their Centenary XI and was named as their &quot;Player of The Century&quot;. In December 2023, during an appearance on The Overlap YouTube channel hosted by Gary Neville, Wright revealed he was bullied by teammate Jim Cannon until Cannon&#x27;s departure from the club in 1988. Wright voiced his experiences with Cannon at the time to Coppell, which included Cannon berating Wright for eating communal food and Cannon &quot;two-foot jumping [Wright]&quot; in the back after he scored past Cannon during a training session. Cannon later disputed parts of Wright&#x27;s account but admitted to giving him &quot;a little slap&quot;.

===Arsenal===
Wright signed for Arsenal in September 1991 for £2.5m, which at the time was a club record fee. He scored on his debut against Leicester City in a League Cup tie, produced a hat-trick on his league debut against Southampton, and in the final match of the season, scored another hat-trick against the Saints to take his total to 31 goals in all competitions. Wright&#x27;s 29 league goals (24 for Arsenal, 5 for Palace) were enough to make him the league&#x27;s top scorer. , only Wright and Teddy Sheringham have led the top-flight scoring charts having scored for two clubs during the season in question.

Wright went on to be the club&#x27;s top scorer for six seasons in a row. He played a major part in the club&#x27;s success during the 1990s, winning an FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993; scoring in both the FA Cup Final itself and the replay against Sheffield Wednesday. Wright also helped Arsenal reach the 1994 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, although he was suspended for the final in which Arsenal beat Parma 1–0.
Wright scored in every round but the final of Arsenal&#x27;s 1995 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup runners-up campaign, and scored freely in the Premier League, but it was a difficult time for Arsenal following the dismissal of manager George Graham over illegal payments, and under caretaker Stewart Houston they could only manage a 12th-place finish in the league.

The arrival of Bruce Rioch led to a bleaker time; the two did not get on, resulting in heated arguments in training, with Rioch berating Wright at half-time of a 5–0 pre-season victory over St Albans City (in which Wright scored). It caused Wright to hand in a transfer request, which he later retracted. The arrival of Dennis Bergkamp brought a brief but fruitful striking partnership: in their first season together, they helped Arsenal finish fifth in the league and qualify for the UEFA Cup. They also reached the League Cup semi-finals, which they lost on away goals to eventual winners Aston Villa.

By the time Arsène Wenger arrived at Arsenal in September 1996, Wright was nearly 33. Despite his age, he continued to score regularly, and was the second-highest Premier League scorer in the 1996–97 season with 23 goals. That season he also set a record by scoring against 17 of Arsenal&#x27;s 19 opponents, a record for a 20 team Premier League season; scoring against every team but Sunderland and Manchester United. However this was equalled by Robin van Persie in 2012. On 13 September 1997, he broke Cliff Bastin&#x27;s club record to become Arsenal&#x27;s then-all-time top scorer with a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers, and his memorable goal celebration saw him reveal a shirt with &quot;Just Done It&quot; written on it.

Wright&#x27;s final goal at Highbury, on 4 October against Barnsley, was his 300th career goal for both Crystal Palace and Arsenal. He scored his final goal for the club on 6 January 1998 in a League Cup quarter-final victory against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground. A hamstring injury ruled him out for much of the remainder of the season. In his absence, Arsenal were eliminated in the semi-final by Chelsea, ending their hopes of a domestic treble. He was an unused substitute as Arsenal won the 1998 FA Cup Final, and lifted his first Premier League title as the Gunners completed a league and cup double.

Wright scored 185 goals from 288 appearances (279 starts) for Arsenal, and scored eleven hat-tricks for them, a total surpassed only by Jimmy Brain and Jack Lambert. , he is Arsenal&#x27;s second highest goalscorer of all time, behind Thierry Henry who broke his record in 2005. Wright placed fourth in a 2008 poll of fans conducted on the club&#x27;s website to select their 50 greatest players.

===Later career===
In July 1998, Wright moved to West Ham United for £500,000. He spent fifteen months as a West Ham player, scoring the winner on his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, without reaching the same form he had at Arsenal. During his spell there he made headlines when he vandalised the referee&#x27;s dressing room at Upton Park after being sent off during a match against Leeds United. He had subsequent short spells at Nottingham Forest, Celtic, and Burnley (whom he helped to promotion to Division One) before retiring in 2000.

Whilst at Celtic, Wright became involved in a campaign by some fans calling for the removal of manager, John Barnes. Celtic&#x27;s performances had been poor and Wright, Barnes and Regi Blinker were considered by some to be not sufficiently talented to improve the club. Wright and Blinker were consequently abused by some Celtic fans. Wright said of the incidents, &quot;I felt I was caught up in a war crisis in Kosovo not involved in a football result that wrecked John Barnes&#x27; career as Celtic manager. Some so-called fans, a few morons who know nothing better, covered my car in spit, they were shouting obscenities at myself and Regi Blinker.&quot; Wright scored on his debut for Celtic as he had for Nottingham Forest. He finished his club career with 313 goals in all competitions.

==International career==
Wright was overlooked for the 1990 World Cup but was handed his England debut by manager Graham Taylor in February 1991.
He started in the 2–0 victory against Cameroon at Wembley and helped England reach the finals of Euro 1992 in Sweden. Despite the fact that his international career spanned eight years, 87 matches and three full-time managers, he only started 17 times and was a used substitute in 16 matches.
In each of the seven seasons that followed the 1990 World Cup, Wright never scored fewer than 23 goals a season for his club. He scored 25 goals for Crystal Palace during the 1990–91 campaign
before going on to break the 30 club-goal barrier five times in the following six seasons. Despite Wright&#x27;s goalscoring feats, the highest number of games he started for England consecutively was three—something he only did twice.

Taylor, who became England manager after the 1990 World Cup in Italy and remained in charge for 38 matches, only handed Wright nine starts and seven substitute appearances. He opted instead to use a whole host of less prolific strikers, including Nigel Clough of Nottingham Forest, Paul Stewart of Tottenham Hotspur, David Hirst of Sheffield Wednesday and Brian Deane of Sheffield United. Wright did not make it into the squad for Euro 1992, with Clough, Gary Lineker of Tottenham Hotspur, Alan Shearer of Southampton and Arsenal teammates Alan Smith and Paul Merson preferred. This was particularly surprising as Wright had been the highest top division goalscorer in England that season.

Five of Wright&#x27;s nine international goals were scored under Taylor&#x27;s management; these included a vital late equaliser in a 1–1 away draw against Poland in May 1993 and four goals in the 7–1 away win against San Marino in Bologna, Italy, in November 1993, the final match of Taylor&#x27;s reign as manager. Both matches were qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup in the US, for which England failed to qualify - missing out for the first time since 1978.

Terry Venables replaced Taylor as manager after the unsuccessful 1994 World Cup qualifying campaign but Wright&#x27;s appearances in the side became even more limited. Despite featuring in four of the first five matches under Venables, albeit three times as a substitute, Wright never played under his management again. Ultimately, it cost Wright a place in the squad for Euro 1996, where England reached the semi-finals as the host nation. Venables vacated his position as England manager after the tournament and was replaced by Glenn Hoddle.

After being absent from international football for 21 consecutive matches, Wright was recalled to the England team by Hoddle in November 1996 when he came off the bench in a 2–0 1998 World Cup qualifying victory in Georgia. It had been over two years since Wright had made his previous England appearance in October 1994.

Four of Wright&#x27;s nine international goals were scored under Hoddle&#x27;s management, including the winner in a 2–1 friendly win against South Africa at Old Trafford in May 1997, and the opener a month later in a 2–0 victory over Italy in the Tournoi de France. England won the four-team tournament, staged as a warm-up event to the 1998 World Cup in France, which also included world champions Brazil as well as the hosts.

Wright went on to help England qualify for the 1998 World Cup by scoring two goals in the 4–0 qualifying campaign victory against Moldova at Wembley in September 1997, before producing arguably his best performance for his country in the vital 0–0 draw in Italy, a month later, which secured his country&#x27;s passage through to the finals. He missed out on the finals through injury.

Following the 1998 World Cup, Wright went on to play a further two times for England as a West Ham United player. He came on as a substitute in the Euro 2000 qualifier in Luxembourg, a match England won 3–0 in October 1998. He made his final international appearance, a month later, in a friendly against the Czech Republic at Wembley. England won the match 2–0 and it also turned out to be Hoddle&#x27;s final game as manager.

Wright started seven matches and was used as a substitute on six occasions under Hoddle, who was manager for 28 matches. He made his first appearance under Hoddle aged 33 and his final appearance under him aged 35. England went on to qualify for Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands, by which time, Wright was approaching his 37th birthday and retired from club football shortly after the tournament. Only Mick Channon played more times for England without being selected for a World Cup or European Championships squad. However, during Channon&#x27;s England career, which spanned the years 1972–1977, England failed to qualify for either of these tournaments, while during Wright&#x27;s they qualified for two European Championships and one World Cup.

==Post-playing career==

===Ashford United===
In March 2007, Wright was appointed Director of football strategy of Isthmian League team, Ashford Town, (now reformed as Ashford United) with him taking his place on the board of directors, following his purchase of a stake in the club.

===Coaching career===
On 18 May 2012, Wright was named as a first team coach at Milton Keynes Dons. He left the role in June 2013.

==Media career==

===Television===
Wright began his television career as a guest host on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He was later signed up by ITV to present his own chat show, &quot;Friday Night&#x27;s All Wright&quot;, on which he interviewed celebrities such as Elton John, Mariah Carey and Will Smith; it ran for two series.

Since then, he has gone on to present programmes such as &quot;Friends Like These&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, &quot;The National Lottery Wright Ticket&quot; and &quot;What Kids Really Think&quot;. He took over from David Seaman in Autumn 2004 as a team captain on BBC game show &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, which ran until 2006.

Wright has also starred in Men &amp; Motors show &quot;Wright Across America&quot;, where he fulfils a lifelong dream to travel coast to coast across America on a Harley-Davidson motorbike, a show famous for Wright&#x27;s rocky relationship with co-host and legendary custom bike builder &quot;Nicky Bootz&quot;.

He also starred in &quot;Ian Wright&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; in which he travels to Greenland with a friend, &#x27;Mrs C&#x27; (Novello Noades, wife of former Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades), to scale the highest mountain in the Arctic, Gunnbjørn.

Wright appeared as a &quot;celebrity hijacker&quot; in the television series &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot;.

On 12 March 2008, Wright was confirmed as one of the presenters of the new series of the popular game show &quot;Gladiators&quot;.

Wright was a presenter on Channel 5&#x27;s early evening magazine programme &quot;Live from Studio Five&quot;, from its launch in September 2009, to August 2010. He originally co-presented the show alongside former model Melinda Messenger and the runner-up of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, Kate Walsh. After Messenger left, Wright continued to present the show alongside Walsh and new presenter Jayne Middlemiss until 11 August 2010. At the beginning of the 12 August edition, Walsh and Middlemiss announced that Wright would not be presenting the show that evening. At the end of the programme, they revealed that he had left the show and would not be returning. Wright was also reported to be unhappy with other changes at the programme, such as its daily airtime being cut from 60 to 30 minutes. During an interview with &quot;Absolute Radio&quot; the next day, Wright stated: &quot;It&#x27;s just been arguments for the last couple of weeks.&quot; His contract was due to end in September 2010 and was not going to be renewed. The show was axed in February 2011.

Wright presented &quot;Football Behind Bars&quot;, a reality TV series aired on Sky1 about his programme to socialise young men incarcerated at Portland Young Offenders Institution in Dorset by organising them in a football academy. The program was an experiment with the prison authority with an eye to expanding it to other prisons if it was successful. The series ran 6 episodes, aired weekly from 7 September to 12 October 2009.

Wright featured on an episode of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2005, posting a 1.47.8 on the celebrity power lap times.

In November 2019, it was announced that Wright would be participating in the nineteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

In February 2021, it was announced that Wright would be hosting a new prime time game show for ITV called &quot;Moneyball.&quot;

Wright makes a number of appearances in the Amazon Original sports docuseries &quot;All or Nothing: Arsenal&quot;, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season.

On 10 March 2023, Wright announced he would boycott the next broadcast of &quot;Match of the Day&quot; in solidarity with presenter Gary Lineker, who stepped back from his duties amid a row over comment criticising the government&#x27;s immigration policies. Wright made his last appearance on the show on 19 May 2024.

In 2001, Wright joined BBC Radio 5 to co-host &quot;The Wright &amp; Bright Show&quot; with former Crystal Palace teammate Mark Bright.

The film debuted on Netflix on 12 January 2024, having premiered at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 15 October 2023.

==Punditry==
Since his retirement from football, Wright appeared as a pundit on BBC Sport&#x27;s &quot;International Match of the Day&quot; and has been a pundit for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and Euro 2004.

On 17 April 2008, Wright quit his job on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and criticised the programme for using him as a &quot;comedy jester&quot;, saying &quot;Fans want people who are dressed like them. They&#x27;ve got no one to relate to on TV and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve said to them I don&#x27;t want to do the England games any more.&quot;

In 2013, he joined BT Sport as a studio analyst for their coverage of the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. Since 2014, Wright has also been a regular studio pundit, along with Lee Dixon, for all England matches on ITV, and was one of the main studio pundits for their coverage of 2014 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2016.

Wright left BT Sport in 2017 to increase his role at the BBC, regularly appearing on &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, as well as continuing to co-host the 606 phone in show on Sunday evenings alongside Kelly Cates. Wright also now co-hosts 5 Live Sport on a Monday evening, alongside Mark Chapman on BBC Radio 5 Live. He also appears every Tuesday on &quot;The Debate&quot; on Sky Sports&#x27; Premier League channel, once again teaming up with Kelly Cates. Wright also appears regularly as one of the BBC&#x27;s lead pundits for live games, regularly working with Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer.

Since October 2020, Wright has co-hosted his own podcast, &quot;Wrighty&#x27;s House&quot;, on The Ringer FC, with a rotating panel of guests including Musa Okwonga, Ryan Hunn, Jeanette Kwakye, Flo Lloyd-Hughes, Carl Anka and Mayowa Quadri.

In 2020, Wright was named TV/Radio Pundit of the Year by the Football Supporters&#x27; Association. He won the award for a second time in 2022 as well as Pundit of the Year at the Broadcast Sports Awards and &quot;World Soccer&quot;″s Broadcaster of the Year.

==Commercials==

Wright has appeared in television commercials for the chicken sauce, Chicken Tonight, Nescafé and Ladbrokes along with Chris Kamara, Ally McCoist and former Arsenal teammate Lee Dixon. Wright appeared in an advertisement for the Wii console where he was seen playing &quot;Mario Strikers Charged&quot; and &quot;Wii Sports&quot; with his son Shaun. In his playing career, Wright was sponsored by the sportswear company Nike, and appeared in Nike commercials. In October 1992, Ian Wright featured on the first TV commercial for Nike in the UK, Nike &quot;Kick it&quot; was Nike first TV commercial for Football. In 1996, he starred in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Eric Cantona, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert, Paolo Maldini and Jorge Campos, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, which culminates with Cantona striking the ball and destroying evil. In 1997 he starred in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Park Life&quot; commercial (set to the tune &quot;Parklife&quot; by Blur) where a group of pub league players playing amateur football at Hackney Marshes in east London are suddenly joined by top Premier League footballers, including Wright, Cantona, David Seaman and Robbie Fowler. In 2000, &quot;Park Life&quot; was ranked number 15 in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of The 100 Greatest TV Ads.
Wright has also done some work for Barclays.

==Writing==
While he was still a professional footballer at Arsenal, Wright published his autobiography, &quot;Mr Wright&quot;. It was first published in hardback in 1996 by Collins Willow. 

In 1993, Wright wrote and released a single, &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot;. The song was co-written and produced by Chris Lowe (of the Pet Shop Boys) and reached No. 43 in the UK Singles Chart.

Wright is also a columnist for tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;.

In 2016, Wright wrote a new and updated version of his autobiography entitled &quot;A Life in Football&quot;, published by Constable.

In 2021, Wright co-wrote his first novel with Musa Okwonga, entitled &quot;Striking Out&quot;. The book is aimed at children and young people and is inspired by many issues that Wright himself dealt with while growing up as a young, black, working-class footballer in London.

==Personal life==
While young, Wright adopted the son of his then girlfriend Sharon Phillips (Shaun, born 1981) and had another child with her (Bradley, born 1985). They both went on to become professional footballers. He also had a son with another girlfriend. Shaun and Bradley have both played for the New York Red Bulls.

Wright&#x27;s cousin Jermaine Wright is also a former footballer. Ian&#x27;s nephew Drey Wright is also a footballer. Ian&#x27;s grandson D&#x27;Margio Wright-Phillips (born 2001), plays for K Beerschot VA.

Wright&#x27;s cousin is actor Patrick Robinson, best known for playing Martin &quot;Ash&quot; Ashford in the long-running British medical drama series &quot;Casualty&quot; on BBC One.
In June 2014, whilst Wright was in Brazil working as a pundit for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, his wife Nancy was held at knifepoint as a gang burgled their family home, whilst their children were upstairs. Wright flew back to England but later returned to Brazil, where he was a pundit on ITV for the Cameroon-Brazil match.

==Honours and awards==
Shortly after his retirement from playing, Wright was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to football. This caused some surprise in view of Wright&#x27;s poor disciplinary record. On 21 April 2022, Wright was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to football and charity.

He was made a Freeman of the City of London on 1 November 2023 in recognition of his sporting achievements.

<doc id="241232" wikidata="Q615445" url="?curid=241232" title="Economic efficiency">
<text>In microeconomics, economic efficiency, depending on the context, is usually one of the following two related concepts:
* Allocative or Pareto efficiency: any changes made to assist one person would harm another.
* Productive efficiency: no additional output of one good can be obtained without decreasing the output of another good, and production proceeds at the lowest possible average total cost.

These definitions are not equivalent: a market or other economic system may be allocatively but not productively efficient, or productively but not allocatively efficient. There are also other definitions and measures. All characterizations of economic efficiency are encompassed by the more general engineering concept that a system is efficient or optimal when it maximizes desired outputs (such as utility) given available inputs.

==Standards of thought==

There are two main standards of thought on economic efficiency, which respectively emphasize the distortions created by &quot;governments&quot; (and reduced by &quot;decreasing&quot; government involvement) and the distortions created by &quot;markets&quot; (and reduced by &quot;increasing&quot; government involvement). These are at times competing, at times complementary—either debating the &quot;overall&quot; level of government involvement, or the effects of &quot;specific&quot; government involvement. Broadly speaking, this dialog takes place in the context of economic liberalism or neoliberalism, though these terms are also used more narrowly to refer to particular views, especially advocating laissez faire.

Further, there are differences in views on microeconomic versus macroeconomic efficiency, some advocating a greater role for government in one sphere or the other.

=== Allocative and productive efficiency ===
A market can be said to have allocative efficiency if the price of a product that the market is supplying is equal to the marginal value consumers place on it, and equals marginal cost. In other words, when every good or service is produced up to the point where one more unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers less than the marginal cost of producing it.

Because productive resources are scarce, the resources must be allocated to various industries in just the right amounts, otherwise too much or too little output gets produced. When drawing diagrams for businesses, allocative efficiency is satisfied if output is produced at the point where marginal cost is equal to average revenue. This is the case for the long-run equilibrium of perfect competition.

Productive efficiency occurs when units of goods are being supplied at the lowest possible average total cost. When drawing diagrams for businesses, this condition is satisfied if the equilibrium is at the minimum point of the average total cost curve. This is again the case for the long run equilibrium of perfect competition. For an extensive discussion of many other types of productive efficiency and its measures (Farrell, Hyperbolic, Directional, Cost, Revenue, Profit, Additive, etc.) and their relationships.

=== Mainstream views ===
The mainstream view is that market economies are generally believed to be closer to efficient than other known alternatives and that government involvement is necessary at the macroeconomic level (via fiscal policy and monetary policy) to counteract the economic cycle – following Keynesian economics. At the microeconomic level there is debate about how to achieve efficiency, with some advocating laissez-faire, to remove government distortions, while others advocate regulation, to reduce market failures and imperfections, particularly via internalizing externalities.

The first fundamental welfare theorem provides some basis for the belief in efficiency of market economies, as it states that any perfectly competitive market equilibrium is Pareto efficient. The assumption of perfect competition means that this result is only valid in the absence of market imperfections, which are significant in real markets.
Furthermore, Pareto efficiency is a minimal notion of optimality and does not necessarily result in a socially desirable distribution of resources, as it makes no statement about equality or the overall well-being of a society.

=== Schools of thought ===
Advocates of limited government, in the form laissez-faire (little or no government role in the economy) follow from the 19th century philosophical tradition classical liberalism. They are particularly associated with the mainstream economic schools of classical economics (through the 1870s) and neoclassical economics (from the 1870s onwards), and with the heterodox Austrian school.

Advocates of an expanded government role follow instead in alternative streams of progressivism; in the Anglosphere (English-speaking countries, notably the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) this is associated with institutional economics and, at the macroeconomic level, with Keynesian economics. In Germany the guiding philosophy is Ordoliberalism, in the Freiburg School of economics.

=== Microeconomic reform===
Microeconomic reform is the implementation of policies that aim to reduce economic distortions via deregulation, and move toward economic efficiency. However, there is no clear theoretical basis for the belief that removing a market distortion will always increase economic efficiency.

The theory of the second best states that if there is some unavoidable market distortion in one sector, a move toward greater market perfection in another sector may actually decrease efficiency.

== Criteria ==

Economic efficiency can be characterized in many ways:

* Allocative efficiency
* Distributive efficiency
* Dynamic efficiency
* Kaldor–Hicks efficiency
* Operational efficiency
* Pareto efficiency
* Productive efficiency
* Optimisation of a social welfare function
* Utility maximization
* X-inefficiency

Applications of these principles include:

* Efficient-market hypothesis
* Microeconomic reform
* Production theory basics
* Welfare economics

<text>Frederick Edmund Emery (27 August 1925 – 10 April 1997) was an Australian psychologist. He was a prominent early figure in the field of organisational development, particularly in the development of the theory around participative work design structures such as self-managing teams.

==Biography==
Emery was born in Narrogin, Western Australia, as the son of a drover. He left school as the Dux of Fremantle Boys&#x27; High in Western Australia when he was 14. He earned his honours degree in science from the University of Western Australia in 1946 and joined the teaching staff of the department there in 1947. He subsequently spent nine years on the staff of the Department of Psychology at the University of Melbourne, where he obtained his PhD in 1953. During 1951-52, he held a UNESCO Fellowship in Social Sciences and was attached to the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in the UK.
As a staff member at the University of Melbourne, he made contributions to rural sociology, CPA, and the effects of film and television viewing.

In 1957, Emery left Australia for London to join the staff of the Tavistock Institute. He worked with Eric Trist on the concept of sociotechnical systems in 1951–52 as a UNESCO Research Fellow, subsequently publishing &quot;The Characteristics of Socio-technical Systems&quot; in 1959.

He, along with Eric Trist, one of his closest intellectual collaborators, and other colleagues, established &quot;open socio-technical systems theory&quot; as an alternative paradigm for organisational design—field-tested on a national scale in Norway, in partnership with Einar Thorsrud.

After his return to Australia, he set about developing a new method to bring in jointly optimised Socio-technical Systems, designed for the diffusion of the concept rather than proof of an alternative to autocracy in the workplace. That method, called the Participative Design Workshop, has been used in Australia and many other countries since 1971, and replaced the older 9-step method used in Norway.

Socio-technical systems are part of a comprehensive theoretical framework called Open Systems Theory (OST). Two of Emery&#x27;s and Trist&#x27;s key publications were: &quot;The Causal Texture of Organisational Environments&quot; (1965) and &quot;Towards a Social Ecology&quot; (1972). These publications are the groundwork on which Fred Emery developed OST.

Emery returned to Australia in 1969 and went to the Australian National University (ANU). He was a senior research fellow there until November 1979, initially in the Department of Sociology, RSSS, and then from 1974 at the Centre for Continuing Education. He had also been visiting professor in Social Systems Science at Wharton&#x27;s Department of Social Systems Sciences, spending 1967–68 at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University.

Emery was awarded the first Elton Mayo award in 1988 by the Australian Psychological Society and received a DSc from Macquarie University in 1992.

At the ANU, Emery continued his action research in industry and the public sector, developing new tools to promote democratic practices in organisations and communities.

In 1979, his CCE Fellowship expired. Afterwards, he worked as a consultant. In the final two years before his death, he co-edited the third and final volume of the &quot;Tavistock anthology&quot;, published by the University of Pennsylvania Press: &quot;The Social Engagement of Social Science&quot;.

Emery died at his home on 10 April 1997, at the age of 71 in Canberra, Australia.

<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 61 was the first successful, practical, and fully controllable helicopter, first flown in 1936. It was also known as the Fa 61, as Focke began a new company—Focke-Achgelis—in 1937.

==Design and development==

Professor Henrich Focke, through his development of the Fw 186, and through the efforts of producing the C.19 and C.30 autogyros under licence, came to the conclusion that the limitations of autogyros could be eliminated only by an aircraft with a powered rotor, the helicopter. He and engineer Gerd Achgelis started the design for this helicopter in 1932. A free-flying model, built in 1934 and propelled by a small two-stroke engine, brought the promise of success. Today, the model can be seen in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

On 9 February 1935, Focke received an order for the building of a prototype, which was designated the Fw 61; Focke referred to it as the F 61. Roluf Lucht of the technical office of the RLM extended the order for a second aircraft on 19 December 1935. The airframe was based on that of a well-tried training aircraft, the Focke-Wulf Fw 44 &quot;Stieglitz&quot;.

Using rotor technology licensed from the Cierva Autogiro Company, a single radial engine drove twin rotors, set on tubular steel outriggers to the left and right of the fuselage. Each main rotor consisted of three articulated and tapered blades, driven by the engine through gears and shafts. Longitudinal and directional control was achieved using cyclic pitch and asymmetric rotor lift.
The counter-rotation of the two rotors solved the problem of torque-reaction as also shown by Louis Bréguet. The small horizontal-axis propeller directly driven by the engine was purely to provide the necessary airflow to cool the engine during low speed or hovering flight and provided negligible forward thrust.

Only two aircraft were produced. The first prototype, the V 1 D-EBVU, had its first free flight on 26 June 1936 with Ewald Rohlfs at the controls. By early 1937, the second prototype, V 2 D-EKRA, was completed and flown for its first flight. On 10 May 1937, it accomplished its first autorotation landing with the engine turned off.

Focke-Achgelis began work on a two-seat sports version of the Fw 61, the &quot;Fa 224&quot;, which would have used an Argus As 10C engine and had greater performance. However, the Fa 224 never left the drawing board at the outbreak of World War II.

==Operational history==

In February 1938, the Fw 61 was demonstrated by Hanna Reitsch indoors at the &quot;Deutschlandhalle&quot; sports stadium in Berlin, Germany.
It subsequently set several records for altitude, speed and flight duration culminating, in June 1938, with an altitude record of 3,427 m (11,243 ft), breaking the unofficial altitude record of the TsAGI 1-EA single lift-rotor helicopter from the Soviet Union set on 14 August 1932, and a straight line flight record of 230 km (143 mi).

Neither of these machines appear to have survived World War II, although a replica is on display at the Hubschraubermuseum in Bückeburg, Germany.

<text>Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] () was a German manufacturer of civil and military aircraft before and during World War II. Many of the company&#x27;s successful fighter aircraft designs were slight modifications of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It is one of the predecessor companies of today&#x27;s Airbus.

==History==
The company was founded in Bremen on 24 October 1923 as Bremer Flugzeugbau AG by Prof. Henrich Focke, Georg Wulf and Dr. rer. pol. Werner Naumann. Almost immediately, they renamed the company Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG (later Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH).

Focke-Wulf merged, under government pressure, with Albatros Flugzeugwerke of Berlin in 1931. The Albatros Flugzeugwerke engineer and test pilot Kurt Tank became head of the technical department and started work on the Fw 44 &quot;Stieglitz&quot; (Goldfinch).

Dr Ludwig Roselius became Chairman in 1925 and handed over to his brother Friedrich in early 1933. In 1938 Roselius&#x27; HAG combine increased its shareholding to 46% and C. Lorenz AG secured 28%. The company was reconstituted as Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH and no longer had to publish its accounts. A substantial capital injection occurred at this time.

In August 1933 Hans Holle and Rudolf Schubert were given power of attorney over the Berlin branch of Focke-Wulf. Then in October 1933, Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau A.G. Albatros Berlin was officially registered with the Department of Trade.

Dr Roselius always remained the driving force of Focke-Wulf. He and his closest collaborator, Barbara Goette, often met with technical director Professor Kurt Tank. When Roselius died in May 1943, Heinrich Puvogel (later chair of Focke-Wulf) raised 4 million RM and continued handling the financial affairs of Focke-Wulf as chief of Seehandel A.G.

Hanna Reitsch demonstrated the Focke-Wulf Fw 61, the first fully controllable helicopter (as opposed to autogyro), in Berlin in 1938. The four-engined Fw 200 airliner flew nonstop between Berlin and New York City on 10 August 1938, making the journey in 24 hours and 56 minutes. It was the first aircraft to fly that route without stopping. The return trip on 13 August 1938, took 19 hours and 47 minutes. These flights are commemorated with a plaque in the Böttcherstraße street of Bremen.

The Fw 190 &quot;Würger&quot; (Shrike/butcher-bird), designed from 1938 on, and produced in quantity from early 1941–1945, was a mainstay single-seat fighter for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during World War II.
Repeated bombing of Bremen in World War II resulted in the mass-production plants being moved to eastern Germany and General Government, with AGO Flugzeugwerke of Oschersleben as a major subcontractor for the Fw 190. Those plants used many foreign and forced labourers, and from 1944 also prisoners of war. Focke-Wulf&#x27;s plant at Marienburg produced approximately half of all Fw 190s and was bombed by the Eighth Air Force on 9 October 1943.

Many Focke-Wulf workers, including Kurt Tank, worked at the Instituto Aerotécnico in Córdoba, Argentina between 1947 and 1955. Others, like Henrich Focke, went to Brazil&#x27;s Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, helping Brazil&#x27;s effort to build Embraer. Focke-Wulf began to make gliders in 1951, and in 1955, motorised planes. Focke-Wulf, Weserflug and Hamburger Flugzeugbau joined forces in 1961 to form the Entwicklungsring Nord (ERNO) to develop rockets.
ITT Corporation, which had acquired a 25% stake in the company prior to the war, won $27 million in compensation in the 1960s for the damage that was inflicted on its share of the Focke-Wulf plant by WWII Allied bombing. Colonel Sosthenes Behn, Ludwig Roselius and Barbara Goette outfoxed Hitler in 1936 when he tried to have Roselius removed as a major stakeholder from Focke-Wulf A.G. and reconstitution followed resulting in the privatized company Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH. Focke-Wulf formally merged with Weserflug in 1964, becoming Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW), which after several further mergers became the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company N.V. (EADS). EADS was later renamed as Airbus SE.

In early 2021 Focke Wulf Aircraft was re-registered as a trademark across the EU, the UK and Australia as a retailer of aviation watches and associated official Focke Wulf merchandise.

<doc id="241240" wikidata="Q1442972" url="?curid=241240" title="Sabre Dance">
<text>&quot;Sabre Dance&quot; is a movement in the final act of Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; (1942), where the dancers display their skill with sabres. It is Khachaturian&#x27;s best known and most recognizable work worldwide. In the composer’s own words, the “Dance of the Kurds”, which subsequently became the “Sabre Dance”, originated with the insistence of the Director of the Kirov Theatre already after the rehearsal process had commenced. Although Khachaturian considered the score to be complete, he reluctantly agreed to add another dance in the last act.

&quot;Sabre Dance&quot; is considered one of the signature pieces of 20th-century popular music. It was popularized by covers by pop artists, first in the U.S. in 1948 and later elsewhere. Its use in a wide range in films and television over the decades have significantly contributed to its renown. &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; has also been used by a number of figure skaters from at least five countries in their performances. 

==Composition==
It is notable for its employment of percussion instruments, especially the xylophone (or tubaphone). Daniel Chetel wrote that it features &quot;very active percussion&quot; with the lead of the xylophone and &quot;dramatic glissandi for the trumpet and trombone.&quot;

Its brief middle section in includes a prominent cello soli in tenor clef and alto saxophone, and is based on an unnamed Armenian folk song. According to Tigran Mansurian, it is a synthesis of an Armenian wedding dance tune from Gyumri tied in a saxophone counterpoint &quot;that seems to come straight from America.&quot; Woodwind auxiliaries include the piccolo, English horn, and bass clarinet. The harp is active throughout, while the celesta plays at the very end.

==Popularity and critical reception==
NPR described it as &quot;one of the catchiest, most familiar—perhaps most maddening—tunes to come out of the 20th century.&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that Khachaturian &quot;never disowned the &#x27;Sabre Dance&#x27;, but he did feel, apparently, that it deflected attention from his other works.&quot; He told an American interviewer, &quot;It&#x27;s like one button on my shirt, and I have many buttons.&quot; According to Nikolai Kapustin, Khachaturian did not like &quot;when people are constantly performing his Sabre Dance and whistling at the same time.&quot; Kapustin told how Khachaturian once &quot;imitated that kind of performance for us. We were laughing. Khachaturian, as well as Prokofiev, had a special sense of humor. They liked to joke with their friends, but only with close people, not everyone.&quot;

Steven Poole notes that its &quot;insistent xylophone-accented melody&quot; has &quot;become a kind of global musical shorthand for cartoonish urgency.&quot; Critics Peter G. Davis and Martin Bernheimer have called it &quot;infamous&quot; and &quot;obnoxious,&quot; Jed Distler characterized it as &quot;notorious&quot;, while David Mermelstein called it &quot;garish and ubiquitous.&quot; Other critics have called it &quot;furiously paced&quot;, &quot;flashing&quot;, &quot;rollicking,&quot; &quot;rousing&quot;, &quot;bustling,&quot; &quot;blazing&quot;, &quot;high-tension, catchy and rhythmically insistent&quot;.

==Classical performances and recordings==

After World War II, records of dances from Khachaturian&#x27;s ballet &quot;Gayane&quot; reached the west and &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; &quot;caused an immediate sensation and straightaway becoming a popular classical hit.&quot; In 1948, three records of &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; reached number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Best-Selling Records by Classical Artists: by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Artur Rodziński), by the New York Philharmonic (conducted by Efrem Kurtz), and by the pianist Oscar Levant (Columbia Records). They were among the Year&#x27;s Top Selling Classical Artists, and it was the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s first million-selling record. A record by the Boston Pops Orchestra also made it to the classical chart.

According to the &quot;Current Biography Yearbook&quot;, it was Levant&#x27;s performance that &quot;received popular attention.&quot; Levant published a piano solo version of it and played the piece five times on the radio program &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot; between December 1947 and December 1948. He also played it on the piano in the 1949 film &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot;.

&quot;Sabre Dance&quot; has also been recorded by Russian-American violinist Jascha Heifetz (1948, transcribed it for violin/piano), Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Fabien Sevitzky, in 1953), the Hungarian-French pianist György Cziffra (1956), the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by Yuri Temirkanov, 1986), the London Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Stanley Black, 1989), the Irish flute player James Galway (1993 album &quot;Dances for Flute&quot;), the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Alexander Lazarev, 1994), the National Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Loris Tjeknavorian, 2005), Franco-Serbian violinist Nemanja Radulović (2014).

In 1986 Irish flautist James Galway made a flute transcription of &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; along with other works of Khachaturian.

==Covers==
===U.S. hit (1948)===
In 1948 &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; was recorded by a number of singers and became a jukebox hit in the U.S., prompting &quot;Newsweek&quot; to suggest that it could be called the &quot;Khachaturian Year in the United States.&quot; 

By May 1948, three records of &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;—a pop-boogie hit by Freddy Martin, a dance-band version by Woody Herman, and a vocal version by The Andrews Sisters with harmonica backing—made it to &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Most-Played Juke Box Records at No. 8, No. 13, and No. 28, respectively. 

Aside from these three versions, it was also recorded by Victor Young&#x27;s orchestra (Decca Records), Ray Bloch&#x27;s orchestra (Signature Records), Macklin Marrow&#x27;s orchestra (MGM), pianist Oscar Levant (Columbia Records), the Angie Bond Trio (Dick Records), and the Harmonickings (Jubilee Records), Macklin Morrow (MGM), Harry Horlick (Crown Recordings). According to John Sforza &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; is a &quot;good example of multiple recordings of the same song in the 1940s recording industry.&quot; The pianist David Rose played it on &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. Charles Magnante offered an arrangement for the accordion and Harry James one for trumpet. 

Two decades later, in 1968, when Khachaturian visited the U.S., &quot;New York Post&quot; music critic Harriett Johnson noted that &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; is Khachaturian&#x27;s &quot;most popular piece in this country.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg agreed, calling it &quot;enormously popular&quot; and adding that the &quot;little whirling piece occupies the same place in his output that the C sharp minor Prelude did in Rachmaninoff&#x27;s.&quot;

<text>Orrick Glenday Johns (June 2, 1887 – July 8, 1946) was an American poet and playwright. He was one of the earliest modernist free-verse poets in Greenwich Village in 1913-1915 and associated with the artist&#x27;s colony at Grantwood, New Jersey (sometimes referred to as Ridgefield), where &quot;&quot; was founded and published by Alfred Kreymborg in 1915. Johns&#x27;s work &quot;Olives,&quot; a series of fourteen small poems appeared in the first issue of July 1915. He is part of a coterie of poets and authors sometimes called the &quot;Others&quot; group who were contributors to the magazine or residents at the colony and included: William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, Mina Loy, Ezra Pound, Conrad Aiken, Carl Sandburg, T. S. Eliot, Amy Lowell, H.D., Djuna Barnes, Man Ray, Skipwith Cannell, Lola Ridge, Marcel Duchamp, and Fenton Johnson (poet) (the only African American published in the magazine). Johns is also associated with poets like Vachel Lindsay and Sara Teasdale. and the dramatist Zoe Akins.

== Early life ==
Johns was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to George Sibley Johns and Minnehaha McDearmon. George Sibley Johns was the editor of the &quot;St. Louis Post Dispatch.&quot; George and Minnehaha had six sons. They moved around St. Louis a lot before they settled into a house on Cabanne Place when Orrick was six years old. He lost a leg in a streetcar accident one year later. After the accident, Johns&#x27;s family had to give up their home on Cabanne Place and move across the tracks to Maple avenue. Johns spent six months in bed recovering from the amputation and spent his time reading and developing a love of writing and publishing. The trolley company was deemed liable for the accident and the family was awarded a small sum. The accident spurred George Sibley Johns as one of Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Editors&quot; to start a newspaper campaign to have the trolleys install better brakes and put fenders on the cars.

Johns was educated locally at public schools, including Dozier School, Central High School, and the University of Missouri. After graduating Johns held several jobs and eventually landed at &quot;Reedy&#x27;s Mirror&quot; as a drama critic by William Marion Reedy. This position gave him his first experience writing professionally.

== Career ==
Johns first gained a national reputation as a poet in 1912. His poem, &quot;Second Avenue,&quot; won &quot;The Lyric Year&quot; poetry contest, despite competing against Edna St. Vincent Millay&#x27;s later famed &quot;Renascence.&quot; The backer of the contest, Ferdinand P. Earle, chose Millay as the winner. Earle sent a letter informing Millay of her win before consulting with the other judges, who had previously and separately agreed on criteria for a winner to winnow down the massive flood of entrants. According to the remaining judges, the winning poem had to exhibit social relevance, which &quot;Renascence&quot; did not. Johns&#x27;s &quot;Second Avenue&quot; was about the &quot;squalid scenes&quot; Johns saw on Eldridge Street and lower Second Avenue on the Lower East Side when he was in New York. It coalesced after seeing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1912. The judges had already awarded Johns the win for this reason, and Millay placed fourth. Controversy ensued and played out in newspaper columns and editorial pages and made both Millay and Johns widely known. Johns received hate mail and made clear he felt her poem was the better one and avoided the awards banquet in his honor. Between 1913 and 1915, Johns lived in Greenwich Village in New York City. He then moved back to St. Louis for three years, where he wrote some of his best works. In his Greenwich Village days, he was known as one of the Lyrical Left—more bohemian than doctrinaire—and did not fully commit to Left politics until he joined the Communist Party briefly in the early 1930s.

Johns published three volumes of poetry, &quot;Black Branches,&quot; &quot;Asphalt&quot; and &quot;Wild Plum&quot; in the Teens and early1920s&quot;.&quot; He wrote a novel, &quot;Blindfold,&quot; and a very successful play, &quot;A Charming Conscience&quot;, which provided him with enough money to reside in Italy for three years. Johns returned to the United States in 1929 and moved to Carmel, California, where he married his third wife. In Carmel, Johns became involved with union organizing and also wrote for Communist newspapers. Johns was an editor of the &quot;New Masses&quot;.

From 1935 to 1937, Johns was the supervisor of the WPA Writers&#x27; Project in New York City. His leftist politics drew negative attention in the media and occasional death threats. He resigned from the WPA project in 1937 and published &quot;Time of Our Lives: The Story of My Father and Myself,&quot; a work that is part autobiography and part biography of his father, George Sibley Johns, who was editor of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; and ran the paper after its owner Joseph Pulitzer went to New York to establish the &quot;New York World.&quot;

In 1938, Johns moved to Connecticut with his fourth wife, Doria Berton, and continued to write articles and short stories.

== Personal life ==
His first wife was Margarite Frances Baird, also known as Peggy Baird and Peggy Cowley from her second marriage to Malcolm Cowley. Johns was married to Grace Wilson from 1917-1926. His third wife was Caroline Blackman (1929-1936) who bore him a daughter named Charis in 1931, and subsequently was institutionalized for mental illness. She starved herself to death in a sanitarium. His fourth wife was Doria Berton (1937-1946) who bore him a daughter named Deborah.

Orrick Johns died by suicide by poisoning himself in Danbury, Connecticut. on July 8, 1946.

He is mentioned in Kenneth Rexroth&#x27;s poem &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot; as &quot;hopping into the surf on his one leg&quot;.

<doc id="241247" wikidata="Q208103" url="?curid=241247" title="Bellows">
<text>A bellows or pair of bellows is a device constructed to furnish a strong blast of air. The simplest type consists of a flexible bag comprising a pair of rigid boards with handles joined by flexible leather sides enclosing an approximately airtight cavity which can be expanded and contracted by operating the handles, and fitted with a valve allowing air to fill the cavity when expanded, and with a tube through which the air is forced out in a stream when the cavity is compressed. It has many applications, in particular blowing on a fire to supply it with air.

The term &quot;bellows&quot; is used by extension for a flexible bag whose volume can be changed by compression or expansion, but not used to deliver air. For example, the light-tight (but not airtight) bag allowing the distance between the lens and film of a folding photographic camera to be varied is called a bellows.

==Etymology==
&quot;Bellows&quot; is only used in plural. The Old English name for &quot;bellows&quot; was , &#x27;blast-bag&#x27;, &#x27;blowing-bag&#x27;; the prefix was dropped and by the eleventh century the simple , , (&#x27;bag&#x27;) was used. The word is cognate with &quot;belly&quot;. There are similar words in Old Norse, Swedish, and Danish and Dutch (blaasbalg), but the derivation is not certain. &#x27;Bellows&#x27; appears not to be cognate with the apparently similar Latin .

== Metallurgy ==
Several processes, such as metallurgical iron smelting and welding, require so much heat that they could only be developed after the invention, in antiquity, of the bellows. The bellows are used to deliver additional air to the fuel, raising the rate of combustion and therefore the heat output.

Various kinds of bellows are used in metallurgy:
* Box bellows were and are traditionally used in East Asia.
* Pot bellows were used in ancient Egypt.
* Tatara foot bellows from Japan.
* Accordion bellows, with the characteristic pleated sides, have been used in Europe for many centuries.
* Piston bellows developed in Southeast Asia (probably by the Austronesian peoples) using the principles of the similarly indigenous fire piston. It led to the independent development of bronze and iron metallurgy in Southeast Asia. They were present in various Southeast Asian cultures, and the technology was transported to Madagascar via the Austronesian expansion.
:*The technology was later adopted and refined by the Han Chinese into the double-action piston bellows, replacing the native Chinese ox hide pot or drum bellows completely.
:* Piston bellows were independently developed in the middle of the 18th century in Europe. 
* Metal bellows were made to absorb axial movement in a dynamic condition. Often referred to as Axial Dynamics bellows types.

Chinese bellows were originally made of ox hide with two pots as described in Mozi&#x27;s book on military technology in the Warring States period (4th century BC). By the Han dynasty, contact with Southeast Asian cultures exposed the Chinese to the bamboo-based piston bellows of Southeast Asians. The acquired piston bellows technology completely replaced the Chinese ox hide bellows that by the Song dynasty, the ox hide bellows were completely extinct. The Han dynasty Chinese mechanical engineer Du Shi (d. 38) is credited with being the first to use hydraulic power on a double-action piston pumps, through a waterwheel, to operate bellows in metallurgy. His invention was used to operate piston bellows of blast furnaces in order to forge cast iron. The ancient Greeks, ancient Romans, and other civilizations used bellows in bloomery furnaces producing wrought iron. Bellows are also used to send pressurized air in a controlled manner in a fired heater.

In modern industry, reciprocating bellows are usually replaced with motorized blowers.

===Double-acting piston bellows===
Double-acting piston bellows are a type of bellows used by blacksmiths and smelters to increase the air flow going into the forge, with the property that air is blown out on both strokes of the handle (in contrast to simpler and more common bellows that blow air when the stroke is in one direction and refill the bellows in the other direction). These bellows blow a more constant, and thus stronger, blast than simple bellows. Such bellows existed in China at least since the 5th century BC, when it was invented, and had reached Europe by the 16th century. In 240 BC, The ancient Greek inventor Ctesibius of Alexandria independently invented a double-action piston bellow used to lift water from one level to another.

A piston is enclosed in a rectangular box with a handle coming out one side. The piston edges are covered with feathers, fur, or soft paper to ensure that it is airtight and lubricated. As the piston is pulled, air enters from the far side and the air in the near chamber is compressed and forced into a side chamber, where it flows through the nozzle. Then as it is pushed air enters from the near side and the air in the far chamber flows through the same nozzle.

===Double-lung accordion bellows===
These have three leaves. The middle leaf is fixed in place. The bottom leaf is moved up and down. The top leaf can move freely and has a weight on it. The bottom and the middle leaves contain valves, the top one does not. Only the top lung is connected to the spout.

When the bottom leaf is moved up, air is pumped from the bottom lung into the top lung. At the same time air is leaving the bellows from the top lung through the spout, but at a slower rate. This inflates the top lung. Next the bottom leaf is moved down to pull fresh air into the bellows. While this happens the weight on the top leaf pushes it down, so air keeps leaving through the spout.

This design does not increase the amount of air flow going into the forge, but provides a more constant air flow compared to a simple bellows. It also provides more even air flow than two simple bellows pumped alternately or one double-acting piston bellows.

==Primitive bellows==

In archaeological ruins of the Levant, archaeologists have found primitive pot bellows, consisting of a ceramic pot to which a loose leather hide had been attached at the top. Such pot bellows were constructed with a wide rim, so that the hide covering would transmit a maximum amount of air when pumped. The covering was fastened to the pot with a cord under an out-turned rim, or in a groove just below the rim exterior. An opening near the base served to insert a pipe of perishable material whose purpose was to direct the air blast to either the furnace or crucible, and which was usually done through the mediation of a tuyère. Tuyères used in conjunction with pot bellows had the function of protecting the ends of perishable tubes leading from the pot into the fire. Places in Saharan Africa still make use of primitive pot bellows.

== Further applications ==
===Fluid transfer applications===
*Bellows are used extensively in hydraulic power circuits and cooling loops.
*They are an essential part of anesthesia machines.
*Cuckoo clocks use bellows to blow air through their gedackt (pipes) and imitate the call of the Common Cuckoo bird.
*Musical instruments may employ bellows as a substitute or regulator for air pressure provided by the human lungs:
**Accordion, concertina and related instruments
**Reed organ
**Pipe organ
**Musette de cour, Uilleann Pipes and some other varieties of bagpipes
**Harmonium and melodeon
**Portative

===Expansion joint applications===
The term &quot;bellows&quot; is used by extension for a number of applications that do not involve air transfer.
*Bellows are widely used in industrial and mechanical applications such as rod boots, machinery way covers, lift covers and rail covers to protect rods, bearings and seals from dirt.
*Bellows are widely used on articulated buses and trams, to cover the joint where the vehicle bends.
*Bellows are used in mechanical aneroids by acting as a precision indicator of pressure levels based on their lateral movement.
*Bellows tubing, a type of lightweight, flexible, extensible tubing may be used for delivery of gas or air at near-ambient pressure, as in early aqua-lung designs.
*Folding and view cameras use bellows to exclude light while allowing the lens to be moved relative to the film plane for focusing and, mainly in view cameras, to allow the lens to slide and tilt to control the image (camera movements).
*Piping expansion joint: In this application, bellows are formed in series to absorb thermal movement and vibration in piping systems that transport high temperature media such as exhaust gases or steam.

=== Beekeeping ===
Bee smokers have bellows attached to the side to provide air to a slow burning fuel. This allows for an increased rate of combustion and a temporarily higher output of smoke on command, something desirable when calming domesticated bees.

<text>The Focke-Wulf Fw 44 &quot;Stieglitz&quot; (Goldfinch) is a twin-seat biplane designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf. It was the company&#x27;s first major international success.

The Fw 44 had a relatively conventional layout for a biplane, possessing a pair of open cockpits that were arranged in tandem; both cockpits were equipped with flight controls and instrumentation. The aircraft had straight untapered wings, fixed tailwheel landing gear, and was typically powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine. It was furnished with ailerons on both upper and lower wings, but did not use flaps. The design team was headed by Kurt Tank. Intended for use as a pilot training and sports aircraft, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight in the latter half of 1932; while initially proving to be troublesome, remedial modifications and design tweaks quickly adapted the Fw 44 into a suitable aircraft for performing aerobatic manoeuvres, a feat which numerous noted pilots took advantage of.

The aircraft quickly garnered substantial orders from flight schools and flying clubs, both in Germany and abroad. The rate of orders was such that not only did Focke-Wulf establish a second factory but multiple licences were issued to other companies, leading to the Fw 44 being produced in several other countries. The &quot;Fw 44C&quot; had been considered to be the definitive version of the aircraft, it was powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine. On several occasions, the type saw key military use; the Republic of China Air Force had their aircraft adapted for frontline combat during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Luftwaffe operated numerous Fw 44s, both before and during the Second World War.

==Design and development==
During the mid-1920s, the recently-formed German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf commenced limited production of their first civil-orientated aircraft, such as the Focke-Wulf A 16. In 1931, the company benefitted from two key events, the merger of rival aircraft manufacturer Albatros Flugzeugwerke with Focke-Wulf and the arrival of the capable aeronautical engineer Kurt Tank as the leader of the firm&#x27;s design department. In this capacity, Tank played a key role in the development of what would become the Fw 44, which commenced that same year.

The Fw 44 was a single bay strut-and-wire-braced twin-seat biplane intended for use as a primary trainer and sporting aircraft. It had equal span wings which had slight sweepback, stagger, and dihedral. The lower wings attached directly to the bottom of the fuselage, the upper wings were connected to the upper fuselage via struts, and a set of N-shaped struts ran between the upper and lower wings on either side of the aircraft. Wood was used for the wing&#x27;s structural members, such as pinewood spars and ribs; a combination of fabric and plywood was used to cover the wing. The structure of the fuselage comprised welded steel tubing; metal panels covered the forward fuselage while a fabric covering was used for elements aft of the rear cockpit.

The tail unit featured mixed construction, being covered with both fabric and plywood; the angle of incidence was adjustable mid-flight. To reduce the risk of a fire within the engine bay, a bulkhead composed of duralumin was present behind the tubular engine mount. The fuselage contained two fuel tanks, the lower of which was used during inverted flight; both tanks were forward of the bulkhead, as was a third tank containing lubricating oil. Both of the aircraft&#x27;s two cockpits, which were open, were compatible with seat-type parachutes. Just aft of the rear cockpit was a luggage locker that was accessed by folding down the seat.

During late summer 1932, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. Early test flights were troubled by a range of technical issues, compelling a detailed redesign of the aircraft. Following extensive modifications and testing, it was determined that the redesigned aircraft not only possessed favourable flight characteristics but was also capable of withstanding considerable stresses; these qualities proved to be quite beneficial for conducting aerobatic manoeuvres. Several noted pilots opted to perform aerial displays using the type, such as Gerd Achgelis, Enrst Edet, and Emil Kopf, the latter&#x27;s aircraft bore the registration &quot;D-EMIL&quot;.

Much of the early demand for the type came from flight schools and flying clubs; the order numbers were such that Focke-Wulf was able to establish a second factory to produce the type. Customers were not only confined to the German market; numerous nations in South America, Europe, and Asia would purchase the type, some opting to establish local production of the Fw 44 in order to meet their needs. Multiple variants of the aircraft were developed, many of which were for these export customers.

The &quot;Fw 44B&quot; was the second production version of the aircraft; it was powered by an Argus As 8 four-cylinder inverted inline air-cooled engine, capable of producing up to 90 kW (120 hp). The cowling for this engine gave the plane a more slender and aerodynamic nose. The definitive version of the aircraft was the &quot;Fw 44C&quot;, which was powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial engine instead.

The last series version was the &quot;Fw 44J&quot;, which was sold or built under license in several countries around the world.

==Operational history==
Twenty Fw 44s were operated by the Republic of China Air Force; these were modified for combat missions and participated in the early stage of the Second Sino-Japanese War, all are believed to have been lost in action.

Many Fw 44Cs were operated by the Luftwaffe; this included during the Second World War, with the Flugzeugführerschulen and one or two Flugkriegsschulen.

=== I.Ae. 23 ===
Between 1937 and 1942 the Fábrica Militar de Aviones (FMA) of Argentina had built 190 units of the FW-44J Stieglitz. It was powered by a domestically built version of the Siemens Bramo Sh-14 engine called the I. Ae. Sh-14. The Fw 44Js were destined for the Argentine Military Aviation School and for numerous aero clubs for use as training aircraft.

In 1944, the Instituto Aerotécnico received the request to experiment with the construction of the Fw 44J, but using purely national woods instead of importing them, following the pattern initiated by the development of the I.Ae. 22 &quot;DL&quot; trainer. The project was named I.Ae. 23. It was known as &quot;Wooden Focke-Wulf&quot; (Focke-Wulf de Madera in Spanish). The I.Ae. 23 flew for the first time on July 7, 1945. The plane was used for training and aerobatics. It was configured with a Kodak photo gun. Despite its success, only one was built, as its design was surpassed by other machines of British origin that were acquired in 1946.

<text>The Asia Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT) is an educational organisation that provides education and training programs in computing and information technology. Founded by Datuk Parmjit Singh and originally based in Malaysia, APIIT has since established other centers in Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. The institute collaborates with selected universities in the United Kingdom and has produced more than 14,000 graduates.

==History==
Asia Pacific IIT was founded in 1993 as part of the Malaysian Government&#x27;s initiative to address the country&#x27;s shortage of IT Professionals. The newly formed Institute was based in Damansara Heights, Kuala Lumpur, and offered Diploma courses in computing and IT.

In the following year, cooperative links were established with Monash University in Australia, leading to the launch of a twinning program in 1995 for Bachelor&#x27;s degrees. This was followed in 1996 by a twinning relationship with Staffordshire University in UK for master&#x27;s degree courses.

Expansion led to the opening of the Kuala Lumpur city campus in 1997, followed by campuses in Karachi, Pakistan (1998), Colombo, Sri Lanka (2000), Lahore, Pakistan (2000), Panipat, India (2001) and Perth, Australia (2004). In 2003, the Malaysian campus moved to new premises at Technology Park Malaysia, now known as &quot;APIIT TPM&quot;.

The curriculum has since developed. In 1998, the institution was recognized as a SUN and Microsoft authorized training center, a SAP University Alliance Partner in 1999, and a Microsoft Certified Technical Education Center in 2001. APIIT gained University College status in 2004.

==Programs and courses==
Courses are run at four levels: foundation, diploma, degree, and postgraduate.

<doc id="241254" wikidata="Q655768" url="?curid=241254" title="The Shaggs">
<text>The Shaggs were an American rock band formed in Fremont, New Hampshire, in 1965. They comprised the sisters Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Wiggin (vocals and lead guitar), Betty Wiggin (vocals and rhythm guitar), Helen Wiggin (drums) and, later, Rachel Wiggin (bass guitar). Their music has been described as both among the worst of all time and a work of unintentional brilliance.

The Shaggs composed seemingly simple and bizarre songs using untuned guitars, erratic time signatures, disconnected rhythms, wandering melodies and rudimentary lyrics. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the sisters sang like &quot;lobotomized Trapp Family Singers&quot;, while the musician Terry Adams compared their music to the free jazz compositions of Ornette Coleman.

The Shaggs formed at the insistence of their father, Austin Wiggin, who believed that his mother had predicted their rise to fame. For several years, he made them practice every day and perform weekly at the Fremont town hall. The girls had no interest in becoming musicians and never became proficient in songwriting or performing. In 1969, Austin paid for them to record an album, &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot;, which was distributed in limited quantities in 1969 by a local record label. The Shaggs disbanded in 1975 after Austin&#x27;s death.

Over the decades, &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; circulated among musicians and found fans such as Frank Zappa and Kurt Cobain. Following a 1980 reissue on Rounder Records, it received enthusiastic reviews for its uniqueness in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. A compilation of unreleased material, &quot;Shaggs&#x27; Own Thing&quot;, was released in 1982. The Shaggs became the subject of fascination in the 1990s, when interest grew in outsider music, and they are credited with influencing twee pop. Dot and Betty reunited for shows in 1999 and 2017; Helen died in 2006. As the Dot Wiggin Band, Dot released an album in 2013 containing previously unrecorded Shaggs songs.

== History ==
=== 1965–1968: Formation and first years ===
The Shaggs were formed in 1965 by the teenage sisters Dorothy (&quot;Dot&quot;), Betty and Helen Wiggin in the small town of Fremont, New Hampshire. Dot wrote the songs, played lead guitar and sang; Betty, the youngest, played rhythm guitar and sang; and Helen, the eldest, played drums. Their younger sister, Rachel, sometimes joined them on bass guitar.

The Shaggs formed at the behest of their father and manager, Austin Wiggin Jr. Austin worked as a mill hand in Exeter, and the family was poor. A Fremont local described him as a humorless man who rarely smiled. He was strict and did not allow the girls to have social lives, friends or boyfriends, or attend concerts. Betty said the girls &quot;missed everything&quot;, and she fantasized about getting a car and leaving home. Some accounts indicated that the girls suffered parental abuse, and Helen said her father was once &quot;inappropriately intimate&quot; with her.

When Austin was young, his mother read his palm and made three predictions: he would marry a strawberry-blonde woman, he would have two sons after she had died, and his daughters would form a popular band. When the first two predictions proved accurate, Austin set about fulfilling the third. According to Dot, he occasionally had the family hold seances in an attempt to communicate with his mother. Dot later said the sisters thought their father was &quot;nuts&quot;, but they did not want to do anything to insult their grandmother in his eyes. She said Austin had no interest in music and only created the band to fulfill the prediction.

Austin withdrew his daughters from school, bought them instruments and arranged for them to receive music and vocal lessons. He named them the Shaggs after the shag hairstyle, which was popular at the time, and in reference to the 1959 film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;. He designed their schedule, with several hours of calisthenics and band practice every day. The sisters had no interest in becoming musicians and did not enjoy the rehearsals. Dot later said: &quot;[Our father] was stubborn and he could be temperamental. He directed. We obeyed. Or did our best.&quot; The girls sometimes went to the lake when their father was out, then arranged their instruments to appear as if they had been practicing.

The Shaggs made their first public performance at a talent show in Exeter in 1968, which was met with mockery. Following a performance at a local nursing home, Austin arranged for the Shaggs to play at the Fremont town hall every weekend, joined sometimes by their brothers Austin III and Robert on percussion and drums. The shows attracted up to a hundred adolescents, who would heckle and throw junk. Rumors spread about the girls&#x27; controlling father, and Dot said Rachel, who attended high school, was bullied. The sisters felt they were poor musicians and found the performances embarrassing. Footage of one concert emerged in 2015, with the Shaggs playing from handwritten charts and performing rudimentary choreography.

=== 1969: &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; ===

In March 1969, Austin took the Shaggs to record an album, &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot;, at Fleetwood Studios in Revere, Massachusetts. The studio was mainly used to record local rock groups and school marching bands. The sisters did not think they were ready to record, and one engineer recalled that they looked &quot;miserable&quot;. Austin dismissed an engineer&#x27;s opinion that they were not ready, saying: &quot;I want to get them while they&#x27;re hot.&quot; One producer, Bobby Herne, recalled that the studio staff shut the control room doors and &quot;rolled on the floor laughing&quot; after they performed.

&quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; was recorded in a single day. Herne and another Fleetwood employee, Charlie Dreyer, were enlisted to remix the recordings. They hired session musicians to rerecord parts, but they were unable to follow the Shaggs&#x27; erratic timing. Austin paid to have Dreyer&#x27;s record company, Third World, press 1000 copies of the album. The liner notes, written by Austin, said the Shaggs &quot;loved&quot; making music and described them as &quot;real, pure, unaffected by outside influences&quot;. The songs &quot;My Pal Foot Foot&quot; and &quot;Things I Wonder&quot; were released as a 45 rpm single on Fleetwood Records.

According to many accounts, Dreyer delivered only 100 copies of the album and disappeared with the remaining 900. Dot said that Dreyer had stolen her father&#x27;s money and could not be traced. However, according to the music executive Harry Palmer, Dreyer said Austin had refused to distribute the extra copies because he feared someone would copy the Shaggs&#x27; music. Palmer said that Dreyer kept boxes of the records in the studio and would give them to anyone who asked. The journalist Irwin Chusid argued that it was unlikely Dreyer had stolen the records, as they were valueless at the time. &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; received no media coverage and the Shaggs resumed performing locally.

=== 1970s: Decline and disbandment ===
Palmer, who had been given several copies of &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; by Dreyer, was intrigued and wondered if he could find the Shaggs an audience. In 1970 or 1971, he attended one of their Fremont performances and was amazed to see locals dancing awkwardly to the music. Palmer approached Austin about promoting the Shaggs, but stressed that people laughed at them and asked if this was a problem. Austin responded with resignation. Palmer decided he was in danger of exploiting the Shaggs as a freak show and did not pursue them.

In 1973, the Shaggs&#x27; weekly town hall shows were halted by the Fremont town supervisors. The sisters were relieved, as they were now adults and had tired of their father&#x27;s control. When Austin discovered that Helen, then 28, had secretly married, he chased her husband with a shotgun. After the police intervened, Helen left the family home to be with her husband, but rejoined the band later.

In 1975, Austin took the Shaggs to Fleetwood Studios for another recording session. Though they had become more proficient through hundreds of hours of practice, the engineer wrote of their poor performances and felt sorry for them. He said they did not notice their out-of-tune guitars or disjointed rhythms when he played the recordings back to them. The recordings went unreleased.

Shortly after the recording session, Austin died of a heart attack at the age of 47. The Shaggs disbanded and sold most of their equipment. A few years later, Betty and Dot married and moved out, and their mother sold the family house. The new owner became convinced that the house was haunted by Austin&#x27;s ghost and donated it to the Fremont fire department, who burnt it down in a firefighting exercise. The Wiggin sisters had never profited from their music and took blue-collar jobs to support their families.

=== 1980s: Cult following and reissues ===
By the 1980s, copies of &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; had circulated among musicians. It developed a cult following, with fans including Frank Zappa, Bonnie Raitt, Jonathan Richman and Carla Bley. Zappa played two songs from the album when he appeared on the &quot;Dr. Demento&quot; radio show. He is often quoted as having called the Shaggs &quot;better than the Beatles&quot;, but this may be apocryphal. Tracks were also played by the Boston radio station WBCN-FM.

The Shaggs also attracted fans in Terry Adams and Tom Ardolino of the American band NRBQ. Adams said he saw beauty and originality in the music and that it was &quot;outside of the normal thinking process for songwriting at the time&quot;. He felt it &quot;needed to be heard&quot; and that people would like it. He traced the Wiggin sisters and convinced them to reissue &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; in 1980 under NRBQ&#x27;s record label, Rounder Records. According to Adams, the sisters were hesitant to reissue the album and initially assumed they would have to pay for it themselves.

Reviewing the reissue for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Debra Ray Cohen described &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; as &quot;the sickest, most stunningly awful &quot;wonderful&quot; record I&#x27;ve heard in ages&quot;. In another &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review that year, Chris Connelly suggested that it could be the worst album ever recorded. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded it their &quot;Comeback of the Year&quot; honor. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Lester Bangs asked: &quot;How do they sound? Perfect! They can&#x27;t play a lick! But mainly they got the right attitude, which is all rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&#x27;s ever been about from day one.&quot; He wrote that &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; could stand with albums by the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks as &quot;one of the landmarks of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll history&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; observed that the Shaggs had been &quot;embraced by the exact opposite audience Austin desired: the longhaired avant-garde intellectuals&quot;.

Adams and Ardolino curated a new release, the 1982 compilation &quot;Shaggs&#x27; Own Thing&quot;, comprising unreleased recordings made between 1969 and 1975. The title track is a duet between Austin and his eldest son, Robert. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;particularly disturbing&quot; and unintentionally Oedipal, noting that Austin sings of catching another man, his son, &quot;doin&#x27; it&quot; with &quot;his girl&quot;. In 1988, &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; and &quot;Shaggs&#x27; Own Thing&quot; were remastered and rereleased by Rounder Records as the compilation &quot;The Shaggs&quot;.

=== 1990s: Media attention and first reunion ===
In the 1990s, interest grew in outsider music — music created by self-taught or naïve musicians. The Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain named the Shaggs as a favorite band. In 1999, RCA Victor reissued &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; with the original cover and track listing. Joe Mozian, a vice president of marketing at RCA Victor, said: &quot;It&#x27;s so basic and innocent, the way the music business used to be ... It is kind of a bad record — that&#x27;s so obvious, it&#x27;s a given. But it absolutely intrigued me, the idea that people would make a record playing the way they do.&quot; Despite the increasing interest in outsider music and airplay on college radio stations, the reissue sold poorly. Mozian speculated that &quot;people are a little afraid of having the Shaggs in their record collections&quot;.

That year, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; ran a profile of the Shaggs by the staff writer Susan Orlean. Dot said she did not listen to their music or feel sentimental about it, and Betty was surprised that Orlean enjoyed it, saying, &quot;God, it&#x27;s horrible.&quot; The sisters did not like Orlean&#x27;s article, and Dot objected that Orlean had written that Betty&#x27;s hair was not in place. Soon after it was published, the actor Tom Cruise and his producing partner Paula Wagner optioned Orlean&#x27;s article for a film.

As of 1999, Dot was working as a cleaner, Betty was a school janitor and a warehouse employee and Helen was living on disability benefits with severe depression. Only Dot remained musically active, playing handbells in a church choir and writing lyrics. That November, Dot and Betty performed four songs at NRBQ&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebration at the Bowery Ballroom in New York, with the NRBQ drummer Tom Ardolino filling in for Helen. The performance was attended by fans from around the world. Dot said later it was the first time she realized the following the Shaggs had amassed. Reviewing the performance for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Eric Weisbard wrote that Dot seemed comfortable in front of the audience but that Betty appeared nervous.

=== 2000s–present: Tributes and second reunion ===
In 2001, the label Animal World released &quot;Better than the Beatles&quot;, a tribute album with covers of Shaggs songs by acts including Ida, Optiganally Yours, R. Stevie Moore, Deerhoof and Danielson Famille. A stage musical about the Shaggs, &quot;Philosophy of the World,&quot; opened in New York City in 2011 in a co-production between Playwrights Horizons and New York Theatre Workshop. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;quirky but dreary&quot; and &quot;hamstrung by tonal uncertainty&quot;, with the girls&#x27; lack of talent made clear but the script hesitant to &quot;turn their lives into a loopy joke&quot;. Rounder Records reissued the &quot;Shaggs&quot; compilation in 2004, and Helen died in 2006.

In 2012, Dot and Betty attended a Shaggs tribute show in Brooklyn organized by the musician Jesse Krakow. Krakow endeavoured to remain faithful to the recordings, saying, &quot;Everybody says the Shaggs are impossible to play, but we&#x27;re going to do it as is.&quot; After Krakow discovered that Dot had unrecorded Shaggs songs, he assembled a group, the Dot Wiggin Band, to record them with her. They released an album, &quot;Ready! Get! Go!&quot;, on Alternative Tentacles Records on October 29, 2013, and toured in support of Neutral Milk Hotel in April 2015. Dot said she had not been interested in recording and &quot;just wanted to get the music out there and get the royalties&quot;. &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; was reissued again in 2016 by Light in the Attic Records. By this point, original copies were selling for up to $10,000.

In 2017, Dot and Betty performed a reunion show at the Solid Sound Festival at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, curated by the band Wilco. Their band comprised Krakow, Brittany Anjou and the drummer Laura Cromwell, who spent hours studying Helen&#x27;s rhythms. Dot was disappointed that Krakow did not correct the mistakes in the music, but acknowledged that &quot;everybody seems to like it the way it was&quot;. She and Betty sang but did not play instruments, and relied on cues from the band on when to come in. Cromwell said that Dot had shown willing in rehearsals, but that Betty was passive and &quot;bewildered&quot;. Dot said Betty only performed for the money, and Betty said she had no interest in performing again.

According to the musician Howard Fishman, reporting on the 2017 show for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the Wiggin sisters did not seem at ease on stage and did not engage much with the audience. He wrote that &quot;watching the Wiggins being led through a zealous re-creation of music they&#x27;d never been particularly proud of was a jarring experience&quot;. Though he acknowledged that Krakow and his band clearly respected the Shaggs&#x27; music, he asked: &quot;What did it mean to celebrate a mistake? If accidental art is recreated on purpose, what is it?&quot; In 2018, the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that a film musical based on the Shaggs would be directed by Ken Kwapis and that Elsie Fisher had been cast.

== Style ==
Though the Shaggs attempted to write traditional pop songs, they instead created unconventional music that many found unpleasant. They were unaware that their music was unusual and did not understand the critical discourse it attracted. The journalist Irwin Chusid described it as &quot;100 percent authentic&quot;, free of irony or &quot;self-conscious indie-rock trendiness&quot;.

The Shaggs used noncoherent chord progressions and played cheap Avalon guitars that were unintentionally out of tune. Their melodies, sung in unison, appear random; Terry Adams of the band NRBQ compared them to the free jazz compositions of Ornette Coleman. The musician Howard Fishman wrote that Dot and Betty&#x27;s vocals had a &quot;sort of intuitive, spooky closeness&quot; similar to sibling acts such as the Delmore Brothers and the Blue Sky Boys. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Debra Ray Cohen wrote that they sang like &quot;lobotomized Trapp Family Singers&quot;. Their songs move unintentionally between different unconventional time signatures. Helen, the drummer, was often detached from her sisters&#x27; playing, and instead played rudiments she recalled from school drum lessons.

Dot wrote lyrics based on her experiences, such as the disappearance of her cat and her longing for straight hair. The &quot;Vice&quot; writer Jennifer Park likened the lyrics to &quot;dilapidated nursery rhymes, fables with overriding messages, and odd Christian songs&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kory Grow wrote that while some Shaggs songs are happy, others &quot;have an inexplicable sadness about them&quot;.

Ron Eyre, the head of the international division of United Artists Records, likened &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; to aboriginal music and music he had heard in China. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Quinn Moreland found the songs intriguing and catchy, and said that the &quot;chaos is negated in the same way that after enough contemplation the violent splatters of a Jackson Pollock painting become calming&quot;. The musician Cub Koda observed an innocence in the Shaggs&#x27; music that he found &quot;both charming and unsettling&quot;.

After recording &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot;, the Shaggs&#x27; technique improved, though they never mastered their instruments. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic David Moore characterized their later material, released on the compilation &quot;Shaggs&#x27; Own Thing&quot;, as &quot;amateurish bubblegum country&quot;. Moreland felt it was &quot;playful and free of anxiety&quot;, and that the covers of songs by acts including the Carpenters were &quot;faithful, even graceful&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The Shaggs&#x27; music has been described as both among the worst of all time and a work of unintentional brilliance. Chusid noted that many people, upon hearing &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot;, wondered if it was the worst album ever recorded. The &quot;LA Weekly&quot; critic Bruce D. Rhodewalt wrote: &quot;If we can judge music on the basis of its honesty, originality and impact, then the Shaggs&#x27; &quot;Philosophy of the World&quot; is the greatest record ever recorded in the history of the universe.&quot; The critic Lindsay Zoladz said the Shaggs&#x27; music was &quot;inscrutable&quot; and challenged listeners to consider what good and bad music is. Koda said it would cause &quot;any listener coming to this music to rearrange any pre-existing notions about the relationships between talent, originality, and ability&quot;.

The Shaggs are important to the history of outsider music (music created by self-taught or naïve musicians). Chusid described them as &quot;the legendary—if unwitting—godmothers of outsider music&quot;. Alan McGee, the founder of Creation Records, wrote that they were &quot;ground zero in the spurious world of outsider music&quot; and &quot;created possibilities&quot; for unheard acts including Daniel Johnston and Wesley Willis.

Moreland argued that the Shaggs were not outsider musicians, as outsider music &quot;is meant to come from an undisturbed place&quot;. She quoted the art brut founder Jean Dubuffet, who said: &quot;[In outsider art] we are witness to the artistic operation in its pristine form, something unadulterated, something reinvented from scratch at all stages by its maker, who draws solely upon his private impulses.&quot; By contrast, Moreland noted that the Shaggs were forced to make music by their father. She identified a claustrophobia and trauma in their music that she argued was negated by calling them outsiders.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that the Shaggs had &quot;laid the groundwork&quot; for the &quot;faux-naivete&quot; of twee pop. According to the journalist and musician Bob Stanley, they inspired &quot;a wave of faux-naive groups&quot;, such as Beat Happening. Reviewing the Shaggs&#x27; 1999 reunion for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Eric Weisbard wrote that they now seemed less unusual, likening their out-of-tune guitars to Sonic Youth and their &quot;mixture of repression and cutesiness&quot; to Shonen Knife. He concluded that their music provided &quot;rough sketches for the future of underground rock&quot;.

<doc id="241255" wikidata="Q28129894" url="?curid=241255" title="Femme">
<text>Femme (; , literally meaning ) is a term traditionally used to describe a lesbian woman who exhibits a feminine identity or gender presentation. While commonly viewed as a lesbian term, alternate meanings of the word also exist with some non-lesbian individuals using the word, notably some gay men and bisexuals. Some non-binary and transgender individuals also identify as lesbians using this term.

Heavily associated with lesbian history and culture, &quot;femme&quot; has been used among lesbians to distinguish traditionally feminine lesbians from their butch (i.e. masculine) lesbian counterparts and partners. Derived from American lesbian communities following World War II when women joined the work force, the identity became a characteristic of the working class lesbian bar culture of the 1940s–1950s. 
By the 1990s, the term &quot;femme&quot; had additionally been adopted by bisexual women.

Bridges state that the terms &quot;butch&quot; and &quot;femme&quot; are derived from the 1940s–1950s American lesbian communities following World War II &quot;when women joined the work force and began wearing pants, creating the possibility for the development of a butch aesthetic and gender expression within gay women&#x27;s communities.&quot; They state that &quot;the butch–femme culture made lesbians visible for the first time.&quot;

Femme lesbian scholar Joan Nestle describes the femme lesbian identity as being underrepresented in historical records, with femme women having been often attacked for passing as straight while also being accused of imitating heteronormativity for pairing with a butch partner. In Nestle&#x27;s text on femme identity, &quot;The Femme Question&quot;, she challenges this commonly held belief by stating that butch–femme relationships are &quot;filled with a deeply lesbian language of stance, dress, gesture, love, courage and autonomy.&quot; Arlene Istar Lev argues that through their subversive appropriation of heteronormative gender roles, these identities were considered &quot;complex erotic and social statements&quot; rooted in &quot;gendered erotic identities&quot;. Nestle states that they publicly declared same-sex love between women at a time when there was no liberation movement to support or protect them, and adds that &quot;in the 1950s particularly, butch–femme couples were the front-line warriors against sexual bigotry. Because they were so visible, they suffered the brunt of street violence. The irony of social change has made a radical, sexual, political statement of the 1950s appear today a reactionary, non feminist experience.&quot;

==1970s and 80s, and rejection of &quot;femme&quot; during lesbian feminism==

Lesbian feminism saw a rejection of the butch–femme dynamic and therefore femme identity. During the emergence of lesbian feminism, femme lesbians were accused by prominent lesbian feminist figures of aping patriarchal beauty standards for wearing traditional feminine clothing. Black lesbian feminist poet and activist Audre Lorde wrote in &quot;Tar Beach&quot; that &quot;butch and femme role playing was the very opposite of what we felt being gay was all about – the love of women&quot;.

Many bisexual women also active in the lesbian community felt pressured to identify as &quot;lesbian&quot;, resulting in bisexual erasure factoring into the history of &quot;femme&quot; identities. This is further impacted by the fact that bisexual communities and the related bisexual movement did not formalize until the 1970s.

==1990s and early 21st-century expansion of femme identity==

===General ===
During the 1990s and the emergence of the lipstick lesbian identity into the mainstream, &quot;femme&quot; became a catch-all term to describe a feminine lesbian. Citing research from the 1990s, Levitt and Bridges stated that the terms &quot;butch&quot; and &quot;femme&quot; &quot;began infiltrating bisexual communities, and women began writing about their experiences as bisexual femmes&quot;, but also that &quot;very little empirical research has been conducted looking at the expression and experience of gender expression and gender identity within bisexual women.&quot;

With expansion of the femme identity, sexual attraction differences between butches and femmes began to be analyzed. Scholars Cheris Kramarae and Dale Spender wrote, &quot;Femme diversity is also manifested in the sexual arena. As many femmes may be attracted exclusively to butches, some are attracted to other femmes, and still others are also attracted to men and consider themselves bisexual.&quot; Some research has indicated that butches are more likely to be exclusively lesbian, while femmes are sometimes bisexual. In 2005, preliminary research conducted by Levitt and Bridges indicated that lesbians are more likely to identify as butch and have a more masculine gender expression than bisexual women. 4.5 percent of the bisexual women they studied identified as butch compared to the 30.1 percent of lesbians who did. Lesbians were more sexually attracted to women whose gender expressions contrasted theirs, and bisexual women were more sexually attracted to those whose gender expressions were more similar to theirs. Levitt and Bridges theorized that &quot;this finding may be in part due to the different aesthetics that are available and popular within lesbian and bisexual communities.&quot;

The term &quot;femme&quot; has also been used to refer to gender non-conforming people who do not identify as lesbian or to transgender or non-binary people. In 1994, Kate Bornstein chronicled their experience as a gender non-conforming person who is a femme lesbian in their book &quot;Gender Outlaw&quot;. Praising the publication of Ivan Coyote&#x27;s &quot;Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme&quot; in 2011, Bornstein said, &quot;The butch/femme dynamic is a conscious, loving binary of desire and trust ... it&#x27;s a dance of love and outlawed romance. Butches and femmes share a sense of tribe, extended family and kinship—no matter what our genders might be.&quot; Since the late 2010s, influenced by the emergence of queer and transgender culture on sites such as Tumblr, Everyday Feminism, and Autostraddle, &quot;femme&quot; has been expanded to describe feminine people across gender and sexuality categories including heterosexual women, cisgender men and transfeminine people.

The postmodern queer conception of femme is a femme-identified person who does not always dress or act in a &quot;traditionally feminine&quot; (meaning a feminine aesthetic, such as wearing makeup, heels, and numerous accessories) way, but who expresses femme identity through feminine-associated behaviours, interactions and political views. Rather than an erotic identity rooted in lesbian women&#x27;s culture, queer femme has been reframed into a political identity that is inclusive of all who wish to identify with it, feminine-presenting or not. As femme has moved into the mainstream, it has also been connected to notions of emotional labor, witchcraft and self-empowerment.

Based on the understanding of &quot;femme&quot; as describing a person (not necessarily a woman) who presents femininely, the expression &quot;women and femmes&quot; is sometimes used, but it has been criticized as conflating two different categories of identity.

&quot;Femme&quot; has also been used to describe a form of contemporary feminism which rejects the gender binary and acknowledges that individuals can fall anywhere within the gender spectrum, resulting in the possibility to be gender-less, gender-fluid, femme or masculine of center. Often using the phrase &quot;women and femmes&quot;, adherents to this definition of femme believe that misogyny is used not only against women to inflict theoretical and physical violence but primarily against all feminine people. Connecting cisgendered male violence to toxic masculinity, they believe that patriarchy not only negatively affects female-identified people but men as well.

Many prominent femme-identified voices in mainstream media tend to be transfeminine and or non-binary individuals. The term &quot;femme&quot; is also essential to ballroom culture through the terms &quot;butch queen&quot; and &quot;femme queen&quot;, denoting a gay man and transgender woman respectively.

===Use of femme by bisexual women ===
By the 1990s, the term &quot;femme&quot; had additionally been adopted by bisexual women. Citing research from the 1990s, Levitt and Bridges stated that the terms &quot;butch&quot; and &quot;femme&quot; &quot;began infiltrating bisexual communities, and women began writing about their experiences as bisexual femmes&quot;, but also that &quot;very little empirical research has been conducted looking at the expression and experience of gender expression and gender identity within bisexual women.&quot;

It has however also been argued by bi+ and other queer activists that since the term bisexual is relatively newer than lesbian, and the term bisexual as a sexual orientation only began to take shape in the mid-19th century, bisexual women historically once formed part of the lesbian community and thus used the term femme as a sub-group of lesbians. This argument posits that the claim that only women with no attraction to men have identified as femmes is ahistoric.

While today there is a common consensus that the term lesbian refers to women who exclusively feel attraction towards women and femmes, the term has carried various changing implications and expansive interpretations throughout history, particularly with the rise of political lesbianism in 1979.

Hence, the adoption of &quot;femme&quot; by bisexuals in the 1990s is considered by some to be a re-adoption by a portion of the same community following the distinction between lesbians and bisexual women and the lesbian separatist movement of the 1970s.

=== Femme identities online ===
Theorists have used aesthetics to analyze and addresses the evolution of the word &quot;femme&quot; throughout the 21st century. Femme theorist Andi Schwartz uses comparisons of modern and historical associations of the femme identity to outline &quot;soft femme theory.&quot; She asserts that in the mid-to-late 20th century, &quot;femme&quot; was used to describe rough, badass women. Today, however, especially on social media, the word &quot;femme&quot; is used to describe the &quot;soft, sad girl&quot; trope that is commonly seen online and in trending fashions. While Schwartz offers a critique of this aesthetic and the erasure of pre-internet femme identities, she also considers how &quot;performing softness&quot; as an identifier for femininity, both on and offline, can be effective in transgressing hegemonic gender norms.

====Use of fem(me) by gay men====
From the 70s through 90s, gay male culture included the phrase &quot;No Fats, No Femmes&quot;, and that persists in queer dating culture today. Constrained by character limitations on gay hookup apps such as Grindr and Scruff, &quot;fem&quot;, &quot;femm&quot;, and &quot;femme&quot; are used as an abbreviation for feminine. The ubiquitous phrase &quot;No Fats, No Fems&quot;, indicating that a user does not want to be contacted by men of a certain size or feminine men, has been challenged by some in the gay community for perpetuating homonormative beauty ideals. &quot;Fem&quot; is used as a descriptor of one&#x27;s appearance or mannerisms.

====Online discourse on bisexual alternatives to femme====
Partly in response to the controversy which emerged regarding which communities are entitled to use femme as a personal identity, as well as in recent efforts to carve out unique bisexual identifiers, bi terms were proposed as equivalents to butch and femme among other gender expressions and presentations. This largely arose in 2016 on the social media and blogging website Tumblr. The term coined for a feminine bisexual woman is “doe”, while “stag” signifies masculinity and “tomcat” represents androgyny.

However this bi-specific lingo never caught on as much as the more widely-known “butch” and “femme”, even amongst the bisexual community itself, and one would be hard-pressed to find a bisexual who identifies as such offline. These neologisms quickly fell out of favor with some in the bisexual community in online discourse, particularly with women of color and other BIPOC, as many found the animal-based terms to be demeaning, dehumanizing, and historically fraught.

==Lesbian femme erasure==
The contemporary queer concepts of femme have been challenged by lesbians who still use the term based on its original meaning. With concern about the erasure of lesbian culture and history, it has been argued that taking a term from an already marginalised society is a form of misogynist appropriation that undervalues lesbian identities, history and women&#x27;s autonomy to self-identify outside patriarchal structures.

In her paper, &quot;Femme Theory: Refocusing the Intersectional Lens&quot;, femme theorist Rhea Hoskin offers an intersectional framework of femme theory and addresses the capabilities of subversive femininities. She uses an intersectional lens to address discourse surrounding femme-phobia and the ways in which this issue is not taken seriously as a form of oppression within the queer community and especially in academic feminist queer spaces.

<text>The IV (Pz.Kpfw. IV), commonly known as the Panzer IV, is a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its ordnance inventory designation was [[Sd.Kfz.]] 161.

The Panzer IV was the most numerous German tank and the second-most numerous German fully tracked armoured fighting vehicle of the Second World War; 8,553 Panzer IVs of all versions were built during World War II, only exceeded by the StuG III assault gun with 10,086 vehicles. Its chassis was also used as the base for many other fighting vehicles, including the assault gun, the self-propelled anti-tank gun, the and self-propelled anti-aircraft gun, and the self-propelled gun.

The Panzer IV saw service in all combat theatres involving Germany and was the only German tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war. The Panzer IV was originally designed for infantry support, while the similar Panzer III was to fight armoured fighting vehicles. However, as the Germans faced the formidable T-34, the Panzer IV had more development potential, with a larger turret ring to mount more powerful guns, so it swapped roles with the Panzer III whose production wound down in 1943. The Panzer IV received various upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extending its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the armour protection or upgrading the weapons, although during the last months of the war, with Germany&#x27;s pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.

The Panzer IV was partially succeeded by the Panther medium tank, which was introduced to counter the Soviet T-34, although it continued to be a significant component of German armoured formations to the end of the war. It was the most widely exported tank in German service, with around 300 sold to Finland, Romania, Spain and Bulgaria. After the war, Syria procured Panzer IVs from France and Czechoslovakia, which saw combat in the 1967 Six-Day War.

==Development history==
===Origins===
The Panzer IV was the brainchild of the German general and innovative armoured warfare theorist Heinz Guderian. In concept, it was intended to be a support tank for use against enemy anti-tank guns and fortifications. Ideally, each tank battalion in a panzer division was to have three medium companies of Panzer IIIs and one heavy company of Panzer IVs. On 11 January 1934, the German army wrote the specifications for a &quot;medium tractor&quot;, and issued them to a number of defense companies. To support the Panzer III, which would be armed with a anti-tank gun, the new vehicle would have a short-barreled, howitzer-like as its main gun, and was allotted a weight limit of . Development was carried out under the name (&quot;accompanying vehicle&quot;), or BW, to disguise its actual purpose, given that Germany was still theoretically bound by the Treaty of Versailles ban on tanks. MAN, Krupp, and Rheinmetall-Borsig each developed prototypes, with Krupp&#x27;s being selected for further development.

The chassis had originally been designed with a six-wheeled interleaved-road wheel suspension (as already adopted for German half-tracks), but the German Army amended this to a torsion bar system. Permitting greater vertical deflection of the road wheels, this was intended to improve performance and crew comfort both on- and off-road. However, due to the urgent requirement for the new tank, neither proposal was adopted, and Krupp instead equipped it with a simple leaf spring double-bogie suspension, with eight rubber-rimmed road wheels per side.

The prototype had a crew of five; the hull contained the engine bay to the rear, with the driver and radio operator, who doubled as the hull machine gunner, seated at the front-left and front-right, respectively. In the turret, the tank commander sat beneath his roof hatch, while the gunner was situated to the left of the gun breech and the loader to the right. The torque shaft ran from the rear engine to the transmission box in the front hull between the driver and radio operator. To keep the shaft clear of the rotary base junction, which provided electrical power to the turret including the motor to turn it, the turret was offset to the left of the chassis centre line, and the engine was moved to the right. Due to the asymmetric layout, the right side of the tank contained the bulk of its stowage volume, which was taken up by ready-use ammunition lockers.

Accepted into service under the designation 622 (Vs.Kfz. 622), &quot;experimental motor vehicle 622&quot;, production began in 1936 at &quot;Fried. Krupp Grusonwerk AG&quot; factory at Magdeburg.

===Ausf. A to Ausf. F1===

The first mass-produced version of the Panzer IV was the  A (abbreviated to Ausf. A, meaning &quot;Variant A&quot;), in 1936. It was powered by a Maybach HL108 TR, producing , and used the SGR 75 transmission with five forward gears and one reverse, achieving a maximum road speed of . As main armament, the vehicle mounted the short-barreled, howitzer-like 37 7.5 cm KwK 37 tank gun, 24 calibres in length which was a low-velocity weapon mainly designed to fire high-explosive shells. Against armoured targets, firing the (armour-piercing shell) at the KwK 37 could penetrate , inclined at 30 degrees, at ranges of up to . A MG 34 machine gun was mounted coaxially with the main weapon in the turret, while a second machine gun of the same type was mounted in the front plate of the hull. The main weapon and coaxial machine gun were sighted with a 5b optic while the hull machine gun was sighted with a 2 optic. The Ausf. A was protected by of steel armour on the front plate of the chassis, and on the turret. This was only capable of stopping artillery fragments, small-arms fire, and light anti-tank projectiles. A total of 35 A versions were produced.

In 1937, production moved to the Ausf. B. Improvements included the replacement of the original engine with the more powerful Maybach HL 120TR, and the transmission with the new SSG 75 transmission, with six forward gears and one reverse gear. Despite a weight increase to , this improved the tank&#x27;s speed to . The glacis plate was augmented to a maximum thickness of , while a new driver&#x27;s visor was installed on the straightened hull front plate, and the hull-mounted machine gun was replaced by a covered pistol port and visor flap. The superstructure width and ammunition stowage were reduced to save weight. A new commander&#x27;s cupola was introduced which was adopted from the Panzer III Ausf. C. A Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung (smoke grenade discharger rack) was mounted on the rear of the hull starting in July 1938 and was back fitted to earlier Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis starting in August 1938. Forty-two Panzer IV Ausf. Bs were manufactured.
The Ausf. C replaced the B in 1938. This saw the turret armour increased to , which brought the tank&#x27;s weight to . After assembling 40 Ausf. Cs, starting with chassis number 80341, the engine was replaced with the improved HL 120TRM. The last of the 140 Ausf. Cs was produced in August 1939.

Production changed to the Ausf. D; this variant, of which 248 vehicles were produced, reintroduced the hull machine gun and changed the turret&#x27;s internal gun mantlet to a thick external mantlet. Again, protection was upgraded, this time by increasing side armour to . As the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 came to an end, it was decided to scale up production of the Panzer IV, which was adopted for general use on 27 September 1939 as the 161 (Sd.Kfz. 161).

In response to the difficulty of penetrating the thick armour of British infantry tanks (Matilda and Matilda II) during the Battle of France, the Germans had tested a gun — based on the 5 cm Pak 38 anti-tank gun — on a Panzer IV Ausf. D. However, with the rapid German victory in France, the original order of 80 tanks was cancelled before they entered production.

In October 1940, the Ausf. E was introduced. This had of armour on the bow plate, while a appliqué steel plate was added to the glacis as an interim measure. A new driver&#x27;s visor, adopted from the Sturmgeschütz III was installed on the hull front plate. A new commander&#x27;s cupola, adopted from the Panzer III Ausf. G, was relocated forward on the turret eliminating the bulge underneath the cupola. Older model Panzer IV tanks were retrofitted with these features when returned to the manufacturer for servicing. 206 Ausf. Es were produced between October 1940 and April 1941.

In April 1941, production of the Panzer IV Ausf. F started. It featured single-plate armour on the turret and hull, as opposed to the appliqué armour added to the Ausf. E, and a further increase in side armour to . The main engine exhaust muffler was shortened and a compact auxiliary generator muffler was mounted to its left. The weight of the vehicle was now , which required a corresponding modification of track width from to reduce ground pressure. The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe &quot;ice sprags&quot;, and the rear idler wheel and front sprocket were modified. The designation Ausf. F was changed in the meantime to Ausf. F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf. F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf. F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.

===Ausf. F2 to Ausf. J ===
On 26 May 1941, mere weeks before Operation Barbarossa, during a conference with Hitler, it was decided to improve the Panzer IV&#x27;s main armament. Krupp was awarded the contract to integrate again the Pak 38 L/60 gun into the turret. The first prototype was to be delivered by 15 November 1941. Within months, the shock of encountering the Soviet T-34 medium and KV-1 heavy tanks necessitated a new, much more powerful tank gun. In November 1941, the decision to up-gun the Panzer IV to the gun was dropped, and instead Krupp was contracted in a joint development to modify Rheinmetall&#x27;s pending anti-tank gun design, later known as 7.5 cm Pak 40 L/46.

Because the recoil length was too great for the tank&#x27;s turret, the recoil mechanism and chamber were shortened. This resulted in the KwK 40 L/43. When the new KwK 40 was loaded with the Pzgr. 39 armour-piercing shell, the new gun fired the AP shell at some , a substantial 74% increase over the howitzer-like KwK 37 L/24 gun&#x27;s muzzle velocity. Initially, the KwK 40 gun was mounted with a single-chamber, ball-shaped muzzle brake, which provided just under 50% of the recoil system&#x27;s braking ability. Firing the 39, the KwK 40 L/43 could penetrate of steel armour at a range of .

The longer 7.5 cm guns made the vehicle nose-heavy to such an extent that the forward suspension springs were under constant compression. This resulted in the tank tending to sway even when no steering was being applied, an effect compounded by the introduction of the H in March 1943.

The Ausf. F tanks that received the new, longer, KwK 40 L/43 gun were temporarily named Ausf. F2 (with the designation Sd.Kfz. 161/1). The tank increased in weight to . Differences between the Ausf. F1 and the Ausf. F2 were mainly associated with the change in armament, including an altered gun mantlet, internal travel lock for the main weapon, new gun cradle, new 5f optic for the L/43 weapon, modified ammunition stowage, and discontinuing of the in favor of turret mounted . Three months after beginning production, the Panzer IV Ausf. F2 was renamed Ausf. G.

During its production run from March 1942 to June 1943, the Panzer IV Ausf. G went through further modifications, including another armour upgrade which consisted of a face-hardened appliqué steel plate welded (later bolted) to the glacis—in total, frontal armour was now thick. This decision to increase frontal armour was favorably received according to troop reports on 8 November 1942, despite technical problems of the driving system due to added weight. At this point, it was decided that 50% of Panzer IV production would be fitted with thick additional armour plates. On 5 January 1943, Hitler decided that all Panzer IV should have frontal armour. To simplify production, the vision ports on either side of the turret and the loader&#x27;s forward vision port in the turret front were removed, while a rack for two spare road wheels was installed on the track guard on the left side of the hull. Complementing this, brackets for seven spare track links were added to the glacis plate.

For operation in high temperatures, the engine&#x27;s ventilation was improved by creating slits over the engine deck to the rear of the chassis, and cold weather performance was boosted by adding a device to heat the engine&#x27;s coolant, as well as a starter fluid injector. A new light replaced the original headlight and the signal port on the turret was removed. On 19 March 1943, the first Panzer IV with &quot;Schürzen&quot; skirts on its sides and turret was exhibited. The double hatch for the commander&#x27;s cupola was replaced by a single round hatch from very late model Ausf. G. and the cupola was up-armoured from to . In April 1943, the KwK 40 L/43 was replaced by the longer KwK 40 L/48 gun, with a redesigned multi-baffle muzzle brake with improved recoil efficiency. The longer L/48 resulted in the introduction of the Turmzielfernrohr 5f/1 optic.

The next version, the Ausf. H, began production in June 1943 and received the designation Sd. Kfz. 161/2. The integrity of the glacis armour was improved by manufacturing it as a single plate. A reinforced final drive with higher gear ratios was introduced. To prevent adhesion of magnetic anti-tank mines, which the Germans feared would be used in large numbers by the Allies, paste was added to all the vertical surfaces of the tank&#x27;s armour. The turret roof was reinforced from to and segments. The vehicle&#x27;s side and turret were further protected by the addition of hull skirts and turret skirts. This resulted in the elimination of the vision ports located on the hull side, as the skirts obstructed their view. During the Ausf. H&#x27;s production run, its rubber-tired return rollers were replaced with cast steel, a lighter cast front sprocket and rear idler wheel gradually replaced the previous components, the hull was fitted with triangular supports for the easily damaged side skirts, the Nebelwurfgerät was discontinued, and a mount in the turret roof, designed for the , was plugged by a circular armoured plate due to initial production shortages of this weapon.

These modifications meant that the tank&#x27;s weight increased to . In spite of a new six-speed SSG 77 transmission adopted from the Panzer III, top speed dropped to as low as on cross country terrain. An experimental version of the Ausf H was fitted with a hydrostatic transmission but was not put into production.

Despite addressing the mobility problems introduced by the previous model, the final production version of the Panzer IV—the Ausf. J—was considered a retrograde from the Ausf. H. Born of necessity, to replace heavy losses, it was greatly simplified to speed production. The electric generator that powered the tank&#x27;s turret traverse was removed, so the turret had to be rotated manually. The turret traversing mechanism was modified and fitted with a second gear which made hand-operation easier when the vehicle was on sloping terrain. On reasonably level ground, hand operation at 4 seconds to traverse to 12.5° and 29.5 seconds to traverse to 120° was achieved. The resulting space was later used for the installation of an auxiliary fuel tank; road range was thereby increased to , The remaining pistol and vision ports on the turret side hatches were removed, and the engine&#x27;s radiator housing was simplified by changing the slanted sides to straight sides. Three sockets with screw threads for mounting a 2-ton jib boom crane were welded on the turret roof while the hull roof was thickened from to . In addition, the cylindrical muffler was replaced by two flame-suppressing mufflers. In June 1944 Wa Prüf 6 had decided that because bomb damage at &quot;Panzerfirma Krupp&quot; in Essen had seriously jeopardized tank production, all plates which should have been face-hardened for the Panzer IV were instead made with rolled homogeneous armour plate. By late 1944, was no longer being applied to German armoured vehicles, and the Panzer IV&#x27;s side-skirts had been replaced by wire mesh, while the gunner&#x27;s forward vision port in the turret front was eliminated and the number of return rollers was reduced from four to three to further speed-up production.

In a bid to augment the Panzer IV&#x27;s firepower, an attempt was made to mate a turret — carrying the longer L/70 tank gun from the developing Panther Ausf. F tank design, and partly developed by Rheinmetall from early 1944 onwards — to a Panzer IV hull. This failed and confirmed that the chassis had reached the limit of its adaptability in both weight and available volume.

==Production==
The Panzer IV was originally intended to be used only on a limited scale, so initially Krupp was its sole manufacturer. Prior to the Polish campaign, only 217 Panzer IVs had been produced: 35 Ausf. A; 42 Ausf. B; and 140 Ausf. C; in 1941, production was extended to &quot;Vogtländische Maschinenfabrik&quot; (&quot;VOMAG&quot;) (located in the city of Plauen) and the Nibelungenwerk in the Austrian city of St. Valentin.

In 1941, an average of 39 tanks per month were built; this rose to 83 in 1942, 252 in 1943, and 300 in 1944. However, in December 1943, Krupp&#x27;s factory was diverted to manufacture the Sturmgeschütz IV and, in the spring of 1944, the Vomag factory began production of the Jagdpanzer IV, leaving the Nibelungenwerk as the only plant still assembling the Panzer IV. With the slow collapse of German industry under pressure from Allied air and ground offensives—in October 1944 the Nibelungenwerk factory was severely damaged during a bombing raid—by March and April 1945, production had fallen to pre-1942 levels, with only around 55 tanks per month coming off the assembly lines.

==Export==
The Panzer IV was one of the most widely exported German tanks of the Second World War. In 1942, Germany delivered 11 tanks to Romania and 32 to Hungary, many of which were lost on the Eastern Front between the final months of 1942 and the beginning of 1943 during the battles around Stalingrad, at which the Hungarian and Romanian troops there were almost annihilated by the attacking Soviet forces. Romania received approximately 120 Panzer IV tanks of different models throughout the entire war. To arm Bulgaria, Germany supplied 46 or 91 Panzer IVs, and offered Italy 12 tanks to form the nucleus of a new Italian Army armoured division. These were used to train Italian tank crews while the-then Italian leader Benito Mussolini was deposed shortly after the Allied conquest of Sicily but were then retaken by Germany during its occupation of Italy in mid-1943. The Falangist Spanish government petitioned for 100 Panzer IVs in March 1943 but only 20 were ever delivered by December that same year. Finland bought 30 but only received 15 in 1944 and in the same year a second batch of 62 or 72 was sent to Hungary (although 20 of these were subsequently diverted to replace German military losses). The Croatian Ustashe Militia received 10 Ausf. F1 and 5 Ausf. G in the autumn of 1944. In total, 297 Panzer IVs of all models were delivered to Germany&#x27;s allies.

==Combat history==

The Panzer IV was the only German tank to remain in both production and combat throughout World War II, and measured over the entire war it comprised 30% of the ″s total tank strength. Although in service by early 1939, in time for the occupation of Czechoslovakia, at the start of the war the majority of German armour was made up of obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs. The Panzer I in particular had already proved inferior to Soviet tanks, such as the T-26, during the Spanish Civil War.

===Poland, Western Front and North Africa (1939–1942)===
When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, its armoured corps was composed of 1,445 Panzer Is, 1,223 Panzer IIs, 98 Panzer IIIs and 211 Panzer IVs; the more modern vehicles amounted to less than 10% of Germany&#x27;s armoured strength. The 1st Panzer Division had a roughly equal balance of types, with 17 Panzer Is, 18 Panzer IIs, 28 Panzer IIIs, and 14 Panzer IVs per battalion. The remaining panzer divisions were heavy with obsolete models, equipped as they were with 34 Panzer Is, 33 Panzer IIs, 5 Panzer IIIs, and 6 Panzer IVs per battalion. Although the Polish Army possessed less than 200 tanks capable of penetrating the German light tanks, Polish anti-tank guns proved more of a threat, reinforcing German faith in the value of the close-support Panzer IV.

Despite increased production of the medium Panzer IIIs and IVs prior to the German invasion of France on 10 May 1940, the majority of German tanks were still light types. According to Heinz Guderian, the Wehrmacht invaded France with 523 Panzer Is, 955 Panzer IIs, 349 Panzer IIIs, 278 Panzer IVs, 106 Panzer 35(t)s and 228 Panzer 38(t)s. Through the use of tactical radios and superior tactics, as well as greater mobility generally, the Germans were able to outmaneuver and defeat French and British armour. However, Panzer IVs armed with the KwK 37 L/24 tank gun found it difficult to engage French tanks such as the Somua S35 and Char B1.

Although the Panzer IV was deployed to North Africa with the German Afrika Korps, until the longer gun variant began production, the tank was outperformed by the Panzer III with respect to armour penetration. Both the Panzer III and IV had difficulty in penetrating the British Matilda II&#x27;s thick armour, while the Matilda&#x27;s 40-mm QF 2 pounder gun could knock out either German tank; the Matilda II&#x27;s major disadvantage was its low speed. By August 1942, Rommel had only received 27 Panzer IV Ausf. F2s, armed with the L/43 gun, which he deployed to spearhead his armoured offensives. The longer gun could penetrate all American and British tanks in theater at ranges of up to , by that time the most heavily armoured of which was the M3 Grant. Although more of these tanks arrived in North Africa between August and October 1942, their numbers were insignificant compared to the amount of matériel shipped to British forces.

The Panzer IV also took part in the invasion of Yugoslavia and the invasion of Greece in early 1941.

===Eastern Front (1941–1945)===
With the launching of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the unanticipated appearance of the KV-1 and T-34 tanks prompted an upgrade of the Panzer IV&#x27;s gun to a longer, high-velocity 75 mm gun suitable for anti-tank use. This meant that it could now penetrate the T-34 at ranges of up to at any angle. The 75 mm KwK 40 L/43 gun on the Panzer IV could penetrate a T-34 at a variety of impact angles beyond range and up to . Shipment of the first model to mount the new gun, the Ausf. F2, began in spring 1942, and by the summer offensive there were around 135 Panzer IVs with the L/43 tank gun available. At the time, these were the only German tanks that could defeat T-34 or KV-1 with sheer firepower. They played a crucial role in the events that unfolded between June 1942 and March 1943, and the Panzer IV became the mainstay of the German panzer divisions. Although in service by late September 1942, the Tiger I was not yet numerous enough to make an impact and suffered from serious teething problems, while the Panther was not delivered to German units in the Soviet Union until May 1943. The extent of German reliance on the Panzer IV during this period is reflected by their losses; 502 were destroyed on the Eastern Front in 1942.

The Panzer IV continued to play an important role during operations in 1943, including at the Battle of Kursk. Newer types, such as the Panther, were still experiencing crippling reliability problems that restricted their combat efficiency, so much of the effort fell to the 841 Panzer IVs that took part in the battle. Throughout 1943, the German army lost 2,352 Panzer IVs on the Eastern Front; some divisions were reduced to 12–18 tanks by the end of the year. In 1944, a further 2,643 Panzer IVs were destroyed, and such losses were becoming increasingly difficult to replace. Nevertheless, due to a shortage of replacement Panther tanks, the Panzer IV continued to form the core of Germany&#x27;s armoured divisions, including elite units such as the II SS Panzer Corps, through 1944.

In January 1945, 287 Panzer IVs were lost on the Eastern Front. It is estimated that combat against Soviet forces accounted for 6,153 Panzer IVs, or about 75% of all Panzer IV losses during the war.

===Western Front (1944–45)===

Panzer IVs comprised around half of the available German tank strength on the Western Front prior to the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. Most of the 11 panzer divisions that saw action in Normandy initially contained an armoured regiment of one battalion of Panzer IVs and another of Panthers, for a total of around 160 tanks, although Waffen-SS panzer divisions were generally larger and better equipped than their counterparts. Regular upgrades to the Panzer IV had helped to maintain its reputation as a formidable opponent. The bocage countryside in Normandy favoured defense, and German tanks and anti-tank guns inflicted very heavy casualties on Allied armour during the Normandy campaign, despite the overwhelming Allied air superiority. German counter-attacks were blunted in the face of Allied artillery, infantry-held anti-tank weapons, tank destroyers and anti-tank guns, as well as the ubiquitous fighter-bomber aircraft. The side skirt armour could predetonate shaped charge anti-tank weapons such as the British PIAT, but could be pulled away by rugged terrain. German tankers in all theaters were &quot;frustrated by the way these skirts were easily torn off when going through dense brush&quot;.

The Allies had also been improving their tanks; the widely used American-designed M4 Sherman medium tank, while mechanically reliable, repairable, and available in large numbers, suffered from an inadequate gun in terms of armour-piercing. Against earlier-model Panzer IVs, it could hold its own, but with its 75 mm M3 gun, struggled against the late-model Panzer IV. The late-model Panzer IV&#x27;s frontal hull armour could easily withstand hits from the weapon on the Sherman at normal combat ranges, though the turret remained vulnerable.

The British up-gunned the Sherman with their highly effective 76 mm QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun, resulting in the Firefly; although this was the only Allied tank capable of dealing with all current German tanks at normal combat ranges, few (342) were available in time for the Normandy invasion. One Sherman in every British troop of four was a Firefly. By the end of the Normandy campaign, a further 550 Fireflies were built. which was enough to make good any losses. A second British tank equipped with the 17-pdr gun, the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger, could not participate in the initial landings having to wait for port facilities to be ready to land. It was not until July 1944 that American Shermans fitted with the 76 mm gun M1 gun achieved a parity in firepower with the Panzer IV.

By 29 August 1944, as the last surviving German troops of Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army began retreating towards Germany, the twin cataclysms of the Falaise Pocket and the Seine crossing cost the Wehrmacht dearly. Of the 2,300 tanks and assault guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported to Hitler that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.

During the winter of 1944–45, the Panzer IV was one of the most numerous tanks in the Ardennes offensive, where further heavy losses—as often due to fuel shortages as to enemy action—impaired major German armoured operations in the West thereafter. The Panzer IVs that took part were survivors of the battles in France between June and September 1944, with around 260 additional Panzer IV Ausf. Js issued as reinforcements.

===Other users===

Finland bought 15 new Panzer IV Ausf. Js in 1944. The remainder of an order for 40 tanks and some StuG IIIs were not delivered and neither were necessary German tank instructors provided. The tanks arrived too late to see action against the Soviet Union but instead ended up being used against Nazi Germany during their withdrawal through Lapland. After the war, they served as training tanks and one portrayed a Soviet KV-1 tank in the movie &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; in 1955. The additional weight, going from the 18.4 tons (Ausf. A) to about 25 tons (Ausf. J), of these modifications strained the simple leaf springed suspension. As a result, the Finnish Army often referred to the PzKpfw IV Ausf.J as the &quot;shaker&quot; for its rough ride, when compared to their StuG IIIs which by comparison had the much better torsion-bar suspension of the PzKpfw III. According to the Finnish this not only affected general crew comfort, but also hampered the accurate aiming of the main gun whilst on the move. What exactly caused these &quot;vibrations&quot; that gave the PzKw IV Ausf. J such a bad name among Finnish tank crews remains somewhat unclear as it isn&#x27;t mentioned in any German or Allied descriptions, but the inadequate leaf spring suspension and comparison with the very smooth ride of the StuG III seems to be the most likely cause.

After 1945, Bulgaria incorporated its surviving Panzer IVs into defensive bunkers as strongpoints along its border with Turkey, along with Soviet T-34 turrets. This defensive line, known as the &quot;Krali Marko Line&quot;, remained in use until the fall of communism in 1989.

Twenty Panzer IV Ausf. Hs and ten StuG III Ausf. Gs were supplied to Spain in December 1943, a small fraction of what Spain had originally asked for. The Panzer IV represented the best tank in Spanish service between 1944 and 1954, and was deployed along with T-26s and Panzer Is. Spain sold 17 Panzer IVs to Syria in 1967, with the remaining three left conserved. These can be found in Madrid, Burgos and Santovenia de Pisuerga (Valladolid).

Most of the tanks Romania had received were lost during combat between 1944 and 1945. These tanks, designated T4 in the army&#x27;s inventory, were used by the Army&#x27;s 2nd Armoured Regiment. On 9 May 1945, only two Panzer IVs were left. Romania received another 50 captured Panzer IV tanks from the Red Army after the end of the war. These tanks were of many different models and were in very bad shape—many of them were missing parts and the side-skirts. These German T4 tanks remained in service until 1950, when the Army decided to use only Soviet equipment. By 1954, all German tanks in Romanian military service had been scrapped.
While their numbers remain uncertain, Syria received around 60 Panzers that were refurbished in France between 1950 and 1952, followed by 50 others purchased from Czechoslovakia in 1954, per the Czechoslovakia-Syria arms deal. A Soviet 12.7mm DShK machine gun on an anti-aircraft mount was retrofitted on the cupola. These ex-German tanks were used to shell Israeli settlements below the Golan Heights, together with Soviet-supplied T-34s, and were fired upon in 1965 during the Water War by Israeli Super Sherman and Centurion tanks. Syria received 17 Panzer IVs from Spain, with these seeing combat during the Six-Day War in 1967. Panzer IVs also participated in 1973 Yom Kippur War, with some dug in as pillboxes. Several of Syria&#x27;s Panzer IVs were captured by the Israeli Army and donated to the Yad La-Shiryon museum, which later traded an Ausf H from this collection to the American Armored Foundation Tank Museum in Danville, Virginia in exchange for an M5 Stuart.

In addition, Turkey was a buyer, with 35 Panzer IVs received until 4 May 1944 in exchange for some chromium ore. Delivery began with the Ausf. G and probably went on with Ausf. H versions. Other sources state only 15 to 22 tanks were delivered in 1943, all of the Ausf G version.

===Captured Panzer IVs in service===

The Soviet Army captured significant numbers of German armoured vehicles, including Panzer IVs (its Russian designation was &quot;T-4&quot;). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for driver or anti-tank training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tiger I/IIs and Panthers were only permitted to be used until they irrecoverably broke down, the simplicity of the Panzer IV and the large number of captured parts allowed for long-term repair and continued use.

At least one captured Panzer IV Ausf. H was used by the Warsaw Tank Brigade of the Polish 2nd Corps in Italy during 1944. One Panzer IV Ausf. J was used by the 5th Independent Armored Artillery Divizion from 1945.

The 1st GMR (Groupement Mobile de Reconnaissance) of the FFI (French Forces of the Interior), later called &#x27;Escadron Autonome de Chars Besnier&#x27;, was equipped in December 1944 with at least one Panzer IV.

==Variants==


In keeping with the wartime German design expediencies of mounting an existing anti-tank gun on a convenient chassis to give mobility, several tank destroyers and infantry support guns were built around the Panzer IV hull. Both the , initially armed with the L/48 tank gun, and the Krupp-manufactured , which was the casemate of the mounted on the body of the Panzer IV, proved highly effective in defense. Cheaper and faster to construct than tanks, but with the disadvantage of a very limited gun traverse, around 1,980 IVs and 1,140 IVs were produced. Another tank destroyer, the Panzer IV/70, used the same basic 75-millimeter L/70 gun that was mounted on the Panther.

The IV (Pz. Bef. Wg. IV) was a command tank. This conversion entailed the installation of additional radio sets with associated mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. To make room for the new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armour, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.

The IV (Pz. Beob. Wg. IV) was an artillery observation vehicle built on the Panzer IV chassis. This, too, received new radio equipment and an electrical generator, installed in the left rear corner of the fighting compartment. worked in cooperation with Wespe and Hummel self-propelled artillery batteries.

The (called &quot;&quot; by Allied intelligence) was an infantry-support self-propelled gun. These vehicles were primarily issued to four units (Numbers 216, 217, 218 and 219) and used during the battle of Kursk and in Italy in 1943. Two separate versions of the IV existed, one without a machine gun in the mantlet and one with a machine gun mounted on the mantlet of the casemate. Furthermore, a artillery gun was mounted in an experimental demountable turret on a Panzer IV chassis. This variant was called the (&quot;grasshopper&quot;). Another 105 mm artillery/anti-tank prototype was the 10.5 cm K &quot;gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette&quot;, nicknamed , made in two examples, both used in the Eastern Front. One caught fire, and the other one fought with success during Operation Barbarossa and Operation Blue; during Operation Blue, it fought in the Battle of Stalingrad.

Four different self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicles were built on the Panzer IV hull. The (&quot;moving van&quot;) was armed with a anti-aircraft cannon; 240 were built between 1944 and 1945. In late 1944 a new , the (&quot;whirlwind&quot;), was designed, with enough armour to protect the gun&#x27;s crew in a rotating turret, armed with the anti-aircraft cannon system; at least 100 were manufactured. Sixty-five (out of an order for 100) similar vehicles with a single 37 mm anti-aircraft cannon were built named (&quot;East wind&quot;). This vehicle was designed to replace the . The final model was the IV , of which only five pilot vehicles were built. This vehicle featured an enclosed turret armed with twin Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103 aircraft cannon.

Although not a direct modification of the Panzer IV, some of its components, in conjunction with parts from the Panzer III, were utilized to make one of the most widely used self-propelled artillery chassis of the war—the III/IV. This chassis was the basis of the , of which 666 were built, and also the gun-armed tank destroyer, with 473 manufactured. To resupply self-propelled howitzers in the field, 150 ammunition carriers were manufactured on the III/IV chassis.

The IV was a armoured recovery vehicle. Some were believed to have been converted locally, 21 were converted from hulls returned for repair between October 1944 and January 1945. The conversion involved removing the turret and adding a wooden plank cover with an access hatch over the turret ring and the addition of a 2-ton jib crane and rigid towing bars.
A rare variant was the Panzer IV . In 1944, Zahnradfabrik (ZF) Augsburg plant produced a prototype with an unusual drive concept. A Panzer IV Ausf. H tank received a fluid drive instead of the normal gearbox. Two oil pumps were installed behind the engine, which in turn drove two oil engines. An axial engine drive transmitted the power to the rear drive wheels via a reduction gear. Instead of the two steering levers, the driver had a crescent-shaped steering wheel with the steering movements of which two steering cylinders were operated, which in turn regulated the volume of the oil pumps and thus regulated the adjacent force on the two drive wheels. The only prototype built was not used and was shipped to America after the war to be subjected to driving tests. These finally had to be discontinued due to a lack of spare parts. The only surviving vehicle is now in United States Army Ordnance Training and Heritage Center in Maryland.

<text>Pinotage is a red wine grape that is South Africa&#x27;s signature variety. It was cultivated there in 1925 as a cross between Pinot noir and Cinsaut (Cinsaut was known as &quot;Hermitage&quot; in South Africa at that time, hence the name). It typically produces deep red varietal wines with smoky, bramble and earthy flavours, sometimes with notes of bananas and tropical fruit, but has been criticised for sometimes smelling of acetone. The grape is a viticultural intraspecific cross of two varieties of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, not an interspecific hybrid.

== History ==
Pinotage is a grape variety that was created in South Africa in 1924 by Abraham Izak Perold, the first Professor of Viticulture at Stellenbosch University. Perold was attempting to combine the best qualities of the robust Hermitage with Pinot noir, a grape that makes great wine but can be difficult to grow. Perold planted the four seeds from his cross in the garden of his official residence at Welgevallen Experimental Farm and then apparently forgot about them. In 1928 he left the university to take up a job with KWV co-operative and the garden became overgrown. The university sent in a team to tidy it up, just as Charlie Niehaus happened to pass by. He was a young lecturer who knew about the seedlings, and rescued them from the clean-up team.

The young plants were moved to Elsenburg Agricultural College under Perold&#x27;s successor, CJ Theron. In 1935 Theron grafted them onto newly established Richter 99 and Richter 57 rootstock at Welgevallen. Meanwhile, Perold continued to visit his former colleagues. Theron showed him the newly grafted vines, and the one that was doing best was selected for propagation and was christened Pinotage. The first wine was made in 1941 at Elsenburg, with the first commercial plantings at Myrtle Grove near Sir Lowry&#x27;s Pass. Also in 1941 Pinotage vines were planted at the Kanonkop Estate by Paul Sauer and Danie Rossouw, the wines of which have later risen to great fame and can mature up to 25 years, so that this estate has even been called &quot;a formidable leader of Cape&#x27;s red wine pack.&quot;

The first recognition came when a Bellevue wine made from Pinotage became the champion wine (General Smuts Trophy Winner) at the Cape Wine Show of 1959, a feat repeated by Sauer &amp; Rossouw in 1961 with their Pinotage from Kanonkop Wine Estate. The Bellevue wine would become the first to mention Pinotage on its label in 1961, when Stellenbosch Farmer&#x27;s Winery (SFW) marketed it under their Lanzerac brand. This early success, and its easy viticulture, prompted a wave of planting during the 1960s.

== Criticism ==
Despite the reputation for easy cultivation, the Pinotage grape has not escaped criticism. A common complaint is the tendency to develop isoamyl acetate during winemaking which leads to a sweet pungency that often smells like paint. A group of British Masters of Wine visiting in 1976 were unimpressed by Pinotage, calling the nose &quot;hot and horrible&quot; and comparing the taste to &quot;rusty nails&quot;. Throughout its history, the grape has seen its plantings rise and fall due to the current fashion of the South African wine industry. In the early 1990s, after the end of Apartheid, the world&#x27;s wine market was opening to South Africa wine and winemakers ignored Pinotage in favour of more internationally recognised varieties like Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Towards the end of the 20th century, the grape&#x27;s fortunes began to turn, and by 1997 it commanded higher prices than any other South African grape.

Oz Clarke has suggested that part of some South African winemakers&#x27; disdain for Pinotage stems from the fact that it&#x27;s a distinctly New World wine while the trend for South African wine is to reflect more European influences and flavours. Despite being a cross from a Burgundy and Rhône grape, Pinotage reflects none of the flavours of a French wine. While not a critique itself, outside of small plantings most notably in New Zealand and the United States, Pinotage has yet to develop a significant presence in any other wine region.

== Pinotage renaissance ==
Pinotage remained relatively obscure internationally until Beyers Truter from Kanonkop won the 1987 Diner&#x27;s Club Wine of the year for his Pinotage. Pinotage has since experienced a renaissance in South Africa, with an increasing number of producers exploring a bright and juicy expression of the variety that shows off the fruit rather than oak, and showing real finesse with less ripe extraction.

From 2007 to 2017, the quality, demand, and supply of Pinotage grew significantly. From around 3 million litres of Pinotage a year at the turn of the century, domestic sales have increased to over 5 million litres, and exports since 2001 have gone from just over 8 million litres a year to close on 19 million litres – contributing an estimated R495 million to the local economy in 2017.

In two decades, winemakers and marketers embraced this grape cultivar, which led to the expansion of the market for Pinotage globally. Competitions like the Absa Top 10 Pinotage Awards, which started in 1997, and initiatives by organisations like the Pinotage Association have assisted in establishing this uniquely South African wine. Accolades like the 2017 Tim Atkin&#x27;s South African Red Wine of the Year (awarded to Beeslaar Pinotage) confirms the trend of quality Pinotage wines. Pinotage weighed heavily in favour of Kanonkop cellarmaster Abrie Beeslaar being named the 2017 Winemaker of the Year at the prestigious International Wine and Spirit Competition in London, making him the second Kanonkop winemaker to achieve the honour after Beyers Truter in 1991.

Of the 10 most-planted wine grape varieties in South Africa, Pinotage is the only red cultivar to have grown in hectares from 2007 to 2017. In 2017, the SA Wine Industry Information &amp; Systems (SAWIS) industry body indicated that the total area under Pinotage vines was 6 979 ha, up from 6.5% to 7.4% of the total area under vines.

Admittedly, even more than 40 years after completely dismissing the grape, many in the United Kingdom&#x27;s wine trade (one of South Africa&#x27;s main export markets) still malign the grape as a whole, but slowly perceptions are changing especially with younger members of the trade becoming strong defenders of the grape.

== Wine regions ==
In addition to South Africa, Pinotage is also grown in Brazil, Canada, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United States and Zimbabwe. In New Zealand, there are of Pinotage. In the US, there are plantings in Arizona, California, Michigan, Oregon and Virginia. German winemakers have recently begun experimenting with the grape.

=== South Africa ===
The majority of the world&#x27;s plantings of Pinotage is found in South Africa, where it makes up just 6% of the vineyard area but is considered a symbol of the country&#x27;s distinctive winemaking traditions. It is a required component (30-70%) in &quot;Cape blends&quot;. Here it is made into the full range of styles, from easy-drinking quaffing wine and rosé to barrel-aged wine intended for cellaring. It is also made into a fortified &#x27;Port wine&#x27; style, and even a red sparkling wine. A white Pinotage wine is now being produced by a small number of winemakers in South Africa, an example being from Oude Compagnies Post in the Tulbagh valley. The latest and fastest growing trend is the production of coffee styled Pinotage. The grape is very dependent on the skill and style of winemaking, with well made examples having the potential to produce deep colored, fruity wines that can be accessible early as well as age.

== Viticulture and winemaking ==
The vines are vigorous like their parent Cinsaut and easy to grow, ripening early with high sugar levels. Pinotage can be grown via the trellised system or as bushvines (untrellised). The older Pinotage vineyards are predominantly planted as bushvines and it is perceived that these lend to more concentration of fruit and depth to the wine. It has the potential to produce yields of 120 hl/ha (6.8 tons/acre) but older vines tend to lower their yields to as low as 50 hl/ha. Yield restriction is managed through water stress and bunch thinning. In winemaking, controlling the coarseness of the grape and the isoamyl acetate character are two important considerations. Volatile acidity is another potential wine fault that can cause Pinotage to taste like raspberry vinegar. Since the 1990s, more winemakers have used long and cool fermentation periods to minimise the volatile esters as well as exposure to French and American oak.

The grape is naturally high in tannins which can be tamed with limited maceration time but reducing the skin contact can also reduce some of the mulberry, blackberry and damson fruit character that Pinotage can produce. Some winemakers have experimented with letting the grapes get very ripe prior to harvest followed by limited oak exposures as another means of taming the more negative characteristics of the grape while maintaining its fruitiness. Newer clones have shown some potential as well.

In recent years South African winemakers have experimented with producing Pinotage in a lighter style, picking grapes earlier for lower sugar and using whole bunches in fermentation to increase the acidity, a style more similar to the parent grape Pinot Noir.

== Synonyms ==
Perold&#x27;s Hermitage x Pinot. The alternative name &#x27;Herminoir&#x27; was considered.

<text>The Orient is a term referring to the East in relation to Europe, traditionally comprising anything belonging to the Eastern world. It is the antonym of the term &quot;Occident&quot;, which refers to the Western world. 

In English, it is largely a metonym for, and coterminous with, the continent of Asia – loosely classified into Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, East Asia, and sometimes including the Caucasus. Originally, the term &quot;Orient&quot; was used to designate only the Near East, but later its meaning evolved and expanded, designating also Central Asia, Southwest Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, or the Far East.

The term oriental is often used to describe objects and people coming from the Orient/eastern Asia.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;Orient&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;oriens&quot;, meaning &quot;east&quot; (lit. &quot;rising&quot; &lt; &quot;orior&quot; &quot;rise&quot;). The use of the word for &quot;rising&quot; to refer to the east (where the sun rises) has analogues from many languages: compare the terms &quot;Arevelk&quot; in (Armenian &quot;Arevelk&quot; means &quot;East&quot; or &quot;Sunrise&quot;), &quot;Levant&quot; (&lt; French &quot;levant&quot; &quot;rising&quot;), &quot;Vostok&quot; (&lt; Russian &quot;voskhod&quot; &quot;sunrise&quot;), &quot;Anatolia&quot; (&lt; Greek &quot;anatole&quot;), &quot;mizrah&quot; in Hebrew (&quot;zriha&quot; meaning sunrise), &quot;sharq&quot; (&lt; Arabic &#x27; &quot;rise&quot;, &#x27; &quot;rising&quot;), &quot;shygys&quot; (&lt; Kazakh &quot;shygu&quot; &quot;come out&quot;), (&lt; Turkish &quot;doğmak&quot; to be born; to rise), &quot;xavar&quot; (meaning east), (, a pictograph of the sun rising behind a tree) and &quot;The Land of the Rising Sun&quot; to refer to Japan. In Arabic, the Mashriq literally means &quot;the sunrise&quot;, &quot;the east&quot;, the name is derived from the verb &quot;sharaqa&quot; ( &quot;to shine, illuminate, radiate&quot; and &quot;to rise&quot;), from sh-r-q root (ش-ر-ق), referring to the east, where the sun rises. Historically, the Mashriq was the southern part of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Many ancient temples, including pagan temples, Hindu temples, Buddhist temples, Jain temples, and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, were built with their main entrances facing the East. This tradition was carried on in Christian churches.

The opposite term &quot;Occident&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;occidens&quot;, meaning &quot;west&quot; (lit. &quot;setting&quot; &lt; &quot;occidere&quot; &quot;fall/set&quot;). This term meant the west (where the sun sets) but has fallen into disuse in English, in favour of &quot;Western world&quot;.

== History of the term ==
Territorialization of the Roman term &quot;Orient&quot; occurred during the reign of emperor Diocletian (284–305), when the Diocese of the Orient (Latin: &quot;Dioecesis Orientis&quot;) was formed. Later in the 4th century, the Praetorian prefecture of the Orient (Latin: &quot;Praefectura Praetorio Orientis&quot;) was also formed, including most of the Eastern Roman Empire, from the Thrace eastwards; its easternmost part was the original &quot;Diocese of the Orient&quot;, corresponding roughly to the region of Syria.

Over time, the common understanding of &quot;the Orient&quot; has continually shifted eastwards, as European people travelled farther into Asia. It finally reached the Pacific Ocean, in what Westerners came to call &quot;the Far East&quot;. These shifts in time and identification sometimes confuse the scope (historical and geographic) of Oriental Studies. Yet there remain contexts where &quot;the Orient&quot; and &quot;Oriental&quot; have kept their older meanings (e.g., &quot;Oriental spices&quot; typically are from the regions extending from the Middle East to sub-continental India to Indo-China). Travellers may again take the Orient Express train from Paris to its terminus in the European part of Istanbul, a route established in the early 20th century.

In European historiography, the meaning of &quot;the Orient&quot; changed in scope several times. Originally, the term referred to Egypt, the Levant, and adjoining areas as far west as Morocco. During the 1800s, India, and to a lesser extent China, began to displace the Levant as the primary subject of Orientalist research, while the term also appears in mid-century works to describe an appearance or perceived similarity to &quot;Oriental&quot; government or culture, such as in Tolstoy&#x27;s 1869 novel War and Peace, in which Napoleon, upon seeing the &quot;oriental beauty&quot; of Moscow, calls it &quot;That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow!&quot;, while in 1843 the American historian William Prescott uses the phrase &quot;barbaric pomp, truly Oriental&quot; to describe the court life of Aztec nobility in his history of the conquest of the Aztec Empire. As late as 1957 Karl Wittfogel included Rome and the Incan Empire in his study of what he called Oriental Despotism, demonstrating the term still carries a meaning in Western thought that transcends geography. By the mid-20th century, Western scholars generally considered &quot;the Orient&quot; as just East Asia, Southeast Asia, and eastern Central Asia. As recently as the early 20th century, the term &quot;Orient&quot; often continued to be used in ways that included North Africa. Today, the term primarily evokes images of China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, and peninsular Southeast Asia. &quot;The Orient&quot; being largely a cultural term, large parts of Asia—Siberia most notably—were excluded from the scholarly notion of &quot;the Orient&quot;.

Equally valid terms for the Orient still exist in the English language in such collocations as Oriental studies (now Asian Studies in some countries).

The adjectival term Oriental has been used by the West to mean cultures, peoples, countries, Asian rugs, and goods from the Orient. &quot;Oriental&quot; means generally &quot;eastern&quot;. It is a traditional designation (especially when capitalized) for anything belonging to the Orient or &quot;East&quot; (for Asia), and especially of its Eastern culture. It indicated the eastern direction in historical astronomy, often abbreviated &quot;Ori&quot;. In contemporary American English, &quot;Oriental&quot; usually refers to things from the parts of East Asia traditionally occupied by East Asians and most Central Asians and Southeast Asians racially categorized as &quot;Mongoloid&quot;. This excludes Jews, Indians, Arabs, and most other South or West Asian peoples. Because of historical discrimination against Chinese, Korean and Japanese, in some parts of the United States, some people consider the term derogatory. For example, Washington State prohibits the word &quot;Oriental&quot; in legislation and government documents and prefers the word &quot;Asian&quot; instead.

In more local uses, &quot;oriental&quot; is also used for eastern parts of countries such as Morocco&#x27;s Oriental Region. &quot;Oriental&quot; may also be used as an synonym of &quot;eastern&quot;, especially in Romance languages. Examples include the &quot;oriental&quot; and &quot;occidental&quot; provinces of Mindoro and Negros in the Philippines, and the French département of Pyrénées-Orientales.

Since the 19th century, &quot;orientalist&quot; has been the traditional term for a scholar of Oriental studies; however, the use in English of &quot;Orientalism&quot; to describe academic &quot;Oriental studies&quot; is rare: the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites only one such usage, by Lord Byron in 1812. &quot;Orientalism&quot; is more widely used to refer to the works of the many 19th-century artists who specialized in &quot;Oriental&quot; subjects and often drew on their travels to North Africa and Western Asia. Artists, as well as scholars, were already described as &quot;Orientalists&quot; in the 19th century. In 1978, the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said published his influential and controversial book, &quot;Orientalism&quot;, and used the term to describe a pervasive Western tradition, both academic and artistic, of prejudiced outsider interpretations of the Arab and Muslim worlds that has been shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and the 19th centuries.

== Current usage ==
=== British English ===
In British English, the term &quot;Oriental&quot; is sometimes still used to refer to people from East and Southeast Asia (such as those from China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Mongolia, Philippines and Indonesia). Judges in the United Kingdom have been issued with guidelines to encourage political correctness where &quot;oriental&quot; should be avoided because it is imprecise and may be considered racist or offensive.

&quot;Asian&quot; in Great Britain sometimes refers to people who come specifically from South Asia (in particular Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Iran, and Afghanistan), since British Asians as a whole make up approximately 9.3% of the population within the United Kingdom, and people of an ethnically South Asian background comprise the largest group within this category. &quot;Orientals&quot; refers exclusively to people of East and Southeast Asian origin, who constitute approximately 0.7% of the UK population as a whole. Of these, the majority are of Chinese descent.
&quot;Orient&quot; is also a word for the lustre of a fine pearl. Hong Kong, a former British colony, has been called &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot; along with Shanghai. In the UK, and much of the commonwealth, it is not considered a pejorative term, with many East Asian people choosing to use it themselves - notably in the names of East Asian businesses such as restaurants and takeaway outlets.

People in the United Kingdom from Southwest Asia, Asia Minor and Near East are often referred to by the term, &quot;Middle Eastern&quot;. These can include Arabs, Kurds, Turks, Assyrians, West Asian Armenians, Yezidis, Egyptians (including Copts), Mandaeans, among others.

In some specific contexts, for example the carpet and rug trade, the older sense of &quot;oriental&quot; to cover not just East Asia but Central Asia, South Asia and Turkey may still be used; an Oriental rug may come from any of these areas.

=== American English ===
The term &quot;Oriental&quot; may sound dated or even be seen as a pejorative, particularly when used as a noun. John Kuo Wei Tchen, director of the Asian/Pacific/American Studies Program and Institute at New York University, said the basic criticism of the term began in the U.S. during a cultural shift in the 1970s. He has said: &quot;With the U.S.A. anti-war movement in the &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, many Asian Americans identified the term &#x27;Oriental&#x27; with a Western process of racializing Asians as forever opposite &#x27;others, by making a distinction between &quot;Western&quot; and &quot;Eastern&quot; ancestral origins.

This is particularly relevant when referring to lands and peoples not associated with the historic &quot;Orient&quot;: outside of the former Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire and Sasanian Empire (Persia), including the former Diocese of the Orient, as well as others lands sharing cultural legacies with the Oriental Orthodox churches and Oriental Catholic Churches. In contrast, regions of Asia further East, outside of the cultural domination of Abrahamic religions, do not share these same historical associations, giving way for the term &quot;oriental&quot; to have different connotations.

In 2016, President Obama signed New York Congresswoman Grace Meng&#x27;s legislation H.R. 4238 replacing the word with &quot;Asian American&quot; in federal law.

=== China ===
The Chinese word 东方 (東方 dongfang, tungfang) is translated as &quot;oriental&quot; in the official English names of several entities, e.g. Oriental Art Center, Oriental Movie Metropolis. In other cases, the same word is more literally translated as &quot;eastern&quot;, e.g. China Eastern Airlines.

=== Uruguay ===
The official name of Uruguay is &quot;Oriental Republic of Uruguay&quot;, the adjective &quot;Oriental&quot; refers to the geographic location of the country, east of the Uruguay River.

The term &quot;Oriental&quot; is also used as Uruguay&#x27;s demonym, usually with a formal or solemn connotation. The word also has a deep historical meaning as a result of its prolonged use in the region, since the 18th century it was used in reference to the inhabitants of the Banda Oriental, the historical name of the territories that now compose the modern nation of Uruguay.

=== German ===
In German, &quot;Orient&quot; is usually used synonymously with the area between the Near East and East Asia, including Israel, the Arab world, and Greater Persia.

The term &quot;Asiaten&quot; (English: Asians) means Asian people in general. Another word for Orient in German is &quot;Morgenland&quot; (now mainly poetic), which literally translates as &quot;morning land&quot;. The antonym &quot;Abendland&quot; (rarely: &quot;Okzident&quot;) is also mainly poetic, and refers to (Western) Europe.

<doc id="241263" wikidata="Q484839" url="?curid=241263" title="Placebo (band)">
<text>Placebo are a British alternative rock band, formed in London in 1994 by vocalist–guitarist Brian Molko and bassist–guitarist Stefan Olsdal, and in late 1994 Robert Schultzberg joined as drummer. Molko was born in Belgium and Olsdal and Schultzberg in Sweden; Molko and Olsdal grew up in Luxembourg before separately relocating to London and becoming British citizens. Schultzberg left the band in 1996 shortly after the release of the band&#x27;s eponymous debut album due to conflicts with Molko, and was replaced the same year by Steve Hewitt. 

Following the release of a demo, a split single, and their eponymous debut album, Placebo gained exposure in 1997 after the single &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; became popular in the UK, a song notorious at the time for its gender-bending content. The band stood out amongst the Britpop scene they were associated with at the time for their androgynous appearance and musical content, as well as Molko&#x27;s distinctive voice and lyrics which openly discussed sexuality, mental health, and drug use.

Hewitt left Placebo in 2007, due to personal and musical differences. He was replaced the following year by Steve Forrest. Placebo released two albums with Forrest, who left in 2015 to pursue his own musical career. Since 2015, Placebo are officially a duo, though augmented with additional musicians. 

Placebo have collaborated with various artists over the years, including David Bowie, Justin Warfield, Michael Stipe and Alison Mosshart. Placebo have released eight studio albums, all of which have reached the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, and have sold around 14 million records worldwide.

==History==
===Formation (1994–1995)===
Placebo founders Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal had both attended the American International School of Luxembourg, although they did not interact at the time as they were part of different social circles. The two met by chance in 1994, in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local gig. On the strength of Molko&#x27;s performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed as Ashtray Heart, named after the Captain Beefheart song of the same name. Molko, however, denied in 2009 that Ashtray Heart was the first name of the band, dismissing this as a rumour and claiming that the band had more names initially.

Originally, the two were unable to decide on a drummer. They played for a while with Steve Hewitt, a friend of Molko, but Hewitt had prior commitments to local band Breed. Robert Schultzberg assumed the position of drummer in late 1994.

The band eventually chose the name Placebo, due to its meaning in Latin, &quot;I shall please&quot;. Molko has frequently stated in interviews that the name is a rejoinder to the 1990s cliché of naming one&#x27;s band after a drug. In an interview, Molko stated:

It&#x27;s a complex question to answer, really. As musicians you try to find a name for your band that represents you and you never really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.

===Debut album, line-up change and glam connection (1996–1998)===
In October 1995, the band released &quot;Bruise Pristine&quot;, a split single with the band Soup, on Fierce Panda. Molko would later speak in negative terms about this release.

By 1996, Placebo were signed with Caroline Records. Their debut album, the self-titled &quot;Placebo&quot;, was released on 17 June 1996. The album was produced by Brad Wood and was influenced, according to Molko, by Sonic Youth and Depeche Mode. The release peaked at No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart at the height of the Britpop era; their highest-charting album in the country until 2022 After the album&#x27;s release, Placebo went on a headlining tour across Europe, performing in countries like France, Italy, and Switzerland. When reviewing a concert, &quot;the New York Times&quot; compared them to bands of the &quot;first wave of post-punk rock, particularly New Order, the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, early U2 and Talking Heads&quot;.

Tension with Schultzberg and the rest of the group had begun to rise in the previous year. The band initially fired him in September 1995, but he was rehired to record the first seven-inch single &quot;Bruise Pristine&quot;. After an argument in August 1996, Molko decided that it would be best for the band if Schultzberg left. The band came to an agreement that Schultzberg would leave once they had finished the promotion of &quot;Placebo&quot;.

Eventually, Schultzberg did indeed leave the band in September 1996, on a United States tour. Before going on stage for their first show in the state of New York, Olsdal informed Schultzberg that he wasn&#x27;t going on the tour in Germany that was following the US one. At the manager&#x27;s request, Schultzberg did two more shows with the band in Paris after the US tour, the last of which was a performance on the French TV show &quot;Nulle part ailleurs&quot;. According to Schultzberg &quot;Molko said that he was &#x27;tired of being the focus of Robert&#x27;s rages against the world&#x27;, and quite frankly, I was tired of being his&quot;. While Schultzberg was with the band, several early works were recorded, including their first 7&quot; single &quot;Bruise Pristine&quot;, the &quot;Come Home&quot; EP, the single version of &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; (with B-sides &quot;Slackerbitch&quot;, &quot;Miss Moneypenny&quot; and the Smiths cover &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;) and their eponymous debut album. On the track &quot;I Know&quot;, Schultzberg played didgeridoo as well as drums.

Steve Hewitt, who had played with the band in 1994, joined Placebo as a full-time member at Molko&#x27;s request.

The most successful song on the debut album was &quot;Nancy Boy&quot;, which peaked at number 4 in the UK Singles Chart upon its release in 1997. The song had been written in 1994, being partially inspired by an infamous quote of Suede&#x27;s Brett Anderson: &quot;I&#x27;m a bisexual man who&#x27;s never had a homosexual experience.&quot; Its lyrics were full of sexual allusions, and Molko admitted at the time: &quot;It&#x27;s not absurd. It&#x27;s obscene. A song this rude should not be number four in the charts.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Life and Loves of a He/She Devil&quot;&gt; Note: copy stored at Placebo Official Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Molko would go on to describe his relationship with the song in a 2016 interview as &quot;very ambivalent&quot;, adding that, although he appreciates the fact that the song had been instrumental in their development as a band, he considers it immature.

The song attracted the attention of David Bowie, who invited the band to open several of his concerts in early 1996. In the following January, Bowie invited them to play at his 50th birthday celebrations at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. The party also included Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Robert Smith of the Cure and Lou Reed.

The band&#x27;s glam rock connections continued. In 1998, Placebo recorded a cover of T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; for the &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; soundtrack and the band appeared in minor roles in the film. Bowie made a special appearance on-stage with Placebo during a tour stop in New York as part of the band&#x27;s late February tour with Stabbing Westward. Placebo played &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; live with David Bowie at the BRIT Awards show in 1999.

Placebo were heavily criticised by the media due to their unorthodox attitude and Brian Molko&#x27;s androgynous appearance. In a 2016 interview related to their early years, Molko commented:

We were reacting very strongly against the machismo, terrace chants and revisionism of Britpop, and the nationalism that we interpreted as xenophobia of the musical kind. We were trying to make a strong political statement about the fluidity of sexuality with the dresses and make-up that we wore. We set out to confuse, and I guess &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; was the perfect soundtrack to that.
===&quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; and &quot;Black Market Music&quot; (1998–2002)===

In 1998, Placebo switched to the major label Virgin Records, and issued their follow-up album &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; on 12 October. The band had a dysfunctional relationship with producer Steve Osborne during the recording of the album, and ended up not speaking to him at all by the time the sessions were over.

The album was another large seller in the UK; the US market embraced the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Pure Morning&quot;, which appeared on MTV and reached number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart, but subsequent singles and videos failed to match the success of its predecessor. &quot;Pure Morning&quot; became Placebo’s highest charting single in the U.S., peaking at number 19 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. &quot;Pure Morning&quot; enjoyed the same success as &quot;Nancy Boy&quot; in the UK, reaching number 4 in the British chart. The video of the song was nominated for the Best British Video award during the 1999 edition of Brit Awards, but lost to Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;Millennium&quot;. Molko would subsequently deem the lyrics of &quot;Pure Morning&quot; as unsatisfying, and would refuse to perform the song live for nine years.

The band kept enjoying success in the UK, as the second single, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot; reached number 5 in the British chart. The third single released was &quot;Every You Every Me&quot;, a number eleven hit. The song appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, which was inspired by the novel &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot; by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos.

The last single on the album, &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; was re-recorded and released as a duet with David Bowie, at Bowie&#x27;s request. Molko would describe this moment in 2016 as an honour, adding that he realised its importance much later in his career.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Black Market Music&quot;, released in October 2000, and produced by Paul Corkett, further experimented with genres outside of regular rock sound. Placebo collaborated with Justin Warfield on &quot;Spite &amp; Malice&quot; and sampled Pavement&#x27;s &quot;Texas Never Whispers&quot; on &quot;Slave to the Wage&quot;. A re-sequenced version released in the US featured a slightly different track listing, adding the aforementioned Bowie version of &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; and the band&#x27;s cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;I Feel You&quot;.

The album created additional UK top 20 hits in &quot;Taste in Men&quot; and &quot;Slave to the Wage&quot;, which reached number 16 and 19 in the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

In a 2001 interview, Molko declared:

I think it&#x27;s the album we always wanted to make. I think without exaggerating even the tiniest bit, we love it and we&#x27;ve never been so happy with an album. Our debut was fast and rough, punk pop, &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; showed our melancholy, depressed side and &quot;Black Market&quot; shows a perfect combination of both sides.
The singer would later become more reserved towards &quot;Black Market Music&quot;, describing it in 2016 as &quot;real somber&quot;, and expressing the regret of not having been involved enough during the production phase.

Placebo encountered resistance from the British music industry upon release of the single &quot;Special K&quot; due to its reference of a ketamine high as a simile for love. Due to this metaphor, the song was censored in the UK. In spite of the controversy, &quot;Black Market Music&quot; reached number 1 in France and number 6 in the UK.

===&quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot; (2003–2005)===
Placebo released their fourth album, produced by Jim Abbiss and named &quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot;, on 24 March 2003. The sound of the album was described in a &quot;Billboard&quot; review as being infused with &quot;edgy electronic flourishes&quot;.

Molko explained the title of an album in an interview:

It is romantic without being sentimental. It&#x27;s an album full of colour. It&#x27;s also the first time when we recorded an album during the summer, after a long break. Before, we were in a sort of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll bubble, we were alternating the studio sessions and the live concerts, we were pretty much cut off from the real world. It&#x27;s dangerous to live too much in this kind of bubble. We had the chance to distance ourselves a bit from everything that happened since 1996 up until now. I also had the occasion to reflect to the montagne russe that is my personal life after these seven years. The ghosts I&#x27;m talking about are the people, the events you&#x27;re wearing into your soul consciously or not.
The album went to No. 11 in the UK and sold 1.4 million copies worldwide. Australian tour dates with Elbow and UK shows with Har Mar Superstar followed in 2004.

First single &quot;The Bitter End&quot; peaked at number 12 in the British single chart. Protège-Moi, the French version of the song &quot;Protect Me From What I Want&quot;, was released as a single in France where it reached number 18.

At the end of 2003, the band released &quot;Sleeping with Ghosts Special Edition&quot;, which was a double-disc release, containing the &quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; album and a bonus disc with ten covers. The bonus disc was re-released in 2010 as a stand-alone under the name &quot;Covers&quot;.

On 15 March 2004, the band released their first live DVD, &quot;Soulmates Never Die (Live in Paris 2003)&quot;, from footage recorded in October 2003 and also including a 25-minute documentary.

On 25 October 2004, Placebo released a singles collection, &quot;Once More with Feeling: Singles 1996–2004&quot;, on both CD and as a DVD featuring the band&#x27;s videos. The nineteen-song compilation included two new tracks, &quot;I Do&quot; and the single &quot;Twenty Years&quot;, which reached number 18 in UK. The compilation was meant to allow the listener to observe Placebo&#x27;s change of lyrics, music and attitude; Molko was highly critical of his early years, comparing in a 2005 interview the first singles with &quot;bad teenage poetry you made at college&quot;.

On 5 November 2004, Placebo played a one-night-only gig at Wembley Arena, in which Robert Smith of The Cure made a guest appearance on two tracks, &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot; and a cover of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. This performance was to be their last UK gig until 2006. After the Wembley gig, Placebo went on a short &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot; tour in South America. On 2 July 2005 the group performed &quot;Twenty Years&quot; and &quot;The Bitter End&quot; at the Live 8 concert, at the Palais de Versailles in France.

===&quot;Meds&quot; and Hewitt&#x27;s departure (2006–2009)===
In September 2005, Placebo finished the recording phase of their fifth studio album, &quot;Meds&quot;, which was produced by Dimitri Tikovoi and released on 13 March 2006. The album was also released in a limited edition, containing a documentary, the lyrics, live videos, three demo versions and the song &quot;Long Division&quot;. The version released in the US had two bonus tracks, &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; and &quot;UNEEDMEMORETHANINEEDU&quot;, but did not include &quot;In the Cold Light of Morning&quot; at Molko&#x27;s demand, who refused to have the song censored. The lead single in the UK market was &quot;Because I Want You&quot;, whereas in the rest of the world the first single was &quot;Song to Say Goodbye&quot; . Two tracks are duets with US singers: &quot;Meds&quot; with Alison Mosshart of The Kills and &quot;Broken Promise&quot; with R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe.

&quot;Meds&quot; was leaked to the internet on 17 January 2006, two months before the official release date. The leak was projected to cause a serious loss of profit by the band&#x27;s record label Virgin Records. Nevertheless, in most countries the album charted well, at No. 1 in France, No. 4 in Australia and No. 7 in the UK.

In 2006 Placebo switched labels in the US to Astralwerks and re-released several revisions of their earlier works. In October their debut album &quot;Placebo&quot; was digitally remastered and re-released on 25 September 2006 with the subtitle &quot;10th Anniversary Collectors Edition&quot;; the box set also included a DVD containing music videos, concerts and TV performances.

In 2007 Placebo joined Linkin Park, My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and various other acts for the annual tour. Following the tour, Virgin released the &quot;Extended Play &#x27;07&quot; EP as a simple introduction for new fans to the band&#x27;s past decade of music. The compilation featured eight songs: &quot;Nancy Boy&quot;, &quot;Every You Every Me&quot;, &quot;Taste in Men&quot;, &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, &quot;Meds&quot;, &quot;Pure Morning&quot;, &quot;Infra-Red&quot; and &quot;Running Up that Hill&quot;.

The relationship between Steve Hewitt and the rest of the band had become tense during the recording of &quot;Meds&quot; and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that &quot;Being in a band is very much like being in a marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don&#x27;t love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you&#x27;ve been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak&quot;. Olsdal commented &quot;We couldn&#x27;t go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn&#x27;t have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the &quot;Meds&quot; tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn&#x27;t talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change.&quot; According to Hewitt, &quot;Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that&#x27;s it. I was thrown out&quot;. Hewitt claims that it was &quot;very hurtful&quot; and &quot;disappointing&quot; to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.

In August 2008, the band announced their new drummer, Steve Forrest of the band Evaline.

Placebo gave one live performance in 2008, as part of an MTV EXIT event, a campaign against human trafficking held in Angkor Wat in December. Placebo left EMI in 2008, but the label released a ten-disc box set of the complete Placebo recordings on 8 June 2009, including all the studio albums and DVDs as well as a collection of B-sides.

===&quot;Battle for the Sun&quot; (2009–2011)===
In January 2009, Placebo announced that they signed with PIAS Entertainment, with Brian Molko commenting: &quot;We were very lucky to have so many great labels interested in signing us, it means a lot, especially after 12 years of releasing records!&quot;

Placebo also confirmed that they had finished working on the follow-up to 2006&#x27;s &quot;Meds&quot; and planned to release it on 8 June 2009. The full track list was announced on the band&#x27;s website in March 2009. The album, &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot;, was the first to feature new drummer Steve Forrest, and was recorded with producer David Bottrill, also known for his work with Tool, Muse, Peter Gabriel and Silverchair.

The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot; debuted on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show on 17 March 2009. Subsequently, it became available for free download on the band&#x27;s official website. On the same day as the track&#x27;s debut, they played a secret concert in London, performing some of the material from the album, including the tracks &quot;Ashtray Heart&quot;, &quot;Julien&quot;, &quot;Kitty Litter&quot;, &quot;Speak in Tongues&quot; and &quot;Devil in the Details&quot;. In their review for the gig, &quot;Rock Sound&quot; wrote that &quot;the new album is a heavier-sounding record compared to its predecessor&quot; and recalls the atmosphere of &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot;. Molko would describe the album in 2013 as &quot;the sound of a band trying to find a new identity, to find out who they were again&quot;.

The first single, &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;, made its radio debut on 20 April 2009, with the official release date being 1 June. It became available for download on iTunes and eMusic on 21 April, and the video for the single premiered on MySpace at the same time.

In May 2009, Placebo performed three concerts in the UK, at venues in Sheffield, Bournemouth and London, before attending the festival season in Europe and Asia. When unveiling the new album with a full track-by-track rundown, Molko told the Scottish edition of &quot;News of the World&quot;: &quot;It feels like a new beginning... we&#x27;re reinvigorated, refreshed and ready to take on the world&quot;.

From 29 to 31 May 2009 fans who signed up for Placebo&#x27;s official mailing list received a unique code for logging into five listenings of the album in its entirety.

At the beginning of August 2009, Placebo canceled a concert in Osaka, Japan, after singer Brian Molko fainted on stage. The band later explained in an official statement that the singer had picked up a virus, which, combined with jet lag and exhaustion, resulted in him collapsing. Following this incident, Placebo also canceled their North American tour.

On 5 November 2009, Placebo won the MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Alternative.

In December 2009, Placebo released &quot;iTunes Live: London Festival &#x27;09&quot;, a live album recorded at the iTunes Festival at The Roundhouse, Camden on 14 July 2009.

In February–April 2010, the band toured Southeast Asia, Australia and South America. The final leg of the tour saw Placebo play Israel and Lebanon, before returning to Europe for a series of festivals and featured concerts. A performance in Thessaloniki, Greece in September 2010 was poorly received by the crowd, sparking boos from a crowd of thousands after performing a 50-minute set.

On 27 September 2010, Placebo released &quot;Battle for the Sun Redux Edition&quot;, which included the single version of &quot;Bright Lights&quot; and a bonus disc featuring several re-recorded old tracks and the new songs &quot;Monster Truck&quot; and &quot;Trigger Happy Hands&quot;. The last shows of the &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot; tour took place in London&#x27;s Brixton Academy on 27–28 September 2010.

The band was going to tour Spain, Portugal, Japan and South Korea, but the shows were canceled due to Molko&#x27;s poor health. In August 2011, Placebo went on a mini-tour of two shows in Berlin and Stuttgart.

On 31 October 2011, the band released their second live video album, &quot;We Come in Pieces&quot;, documenting the live performance at the Brixton Academy on 28 September 2010. The DVD also featured a short movie, &quot;Trigger Happy Hands&quot;, and a documentary, &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, directed by Charlie Targett-Adams.

On 12 December 2011, Placebo released an iTunes exclusive live album, &quot;Live at Angkor Wat&quot;, which featured the semi-acoustic concert performed at Angkor Wat in 2008.

===&quot;B3&quot;, &quot;Loud Like Love&quot; and Forrest&#x27;s departure (2012–2015)===
On 29 November 2011, Placebo announced they would be headlining the Sundance Film and Music Festival in April 2012. In January 2012 the band confirmed their participation at the Rock im Pott festival scheduled for 25 August 2012 at Arena AufSchalke, Germany, along with the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bass player Stefan Olsdal also confirmed for &quot;Billboard&quot; that the band would return to the studio in 2012 to record the follow-up to &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot;.

From April to September 2012, Placebo toured Europe. In June and July 2012, Placebo also played exclusive concerts in Madrid, Paris, Rome, Zurich and Hamburg for the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz A-Class. The band canceled a concert during an Austrian festival due to Molko&#x27;s health problems, leaving the stage after only one song.

In August 2012, Molko revealed on Italy&#x27;s Rai Radio 2 that a new single titled &quot;B3&quot; would be released in September. A five-track EP titled &quot;B3&quot; was released in October 2012. It was reissued on 10&quot; vinyl for Record Store Day 2013.

During the &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot; tour, Molko and Olsdal both stated on various occasions that they were working on material for the next studio album.

On 21 May 2013, Placebo announced the release of their seventh studio album, &quot;Loud Like Love&quot;, and confirmed a tour of the United Kingdom in December. On 12 July, the band released a lyric video for the song &quot;Too Many Friends&quot;, the first single on the new album, with the official music video being subsequently released in August and featuring author Bret Easton Ellis.

Produced by Adam Noble, the album was released on 16 September 2013 in five different formats. The same day, Placebo streamed live a 90-minute show, &quot;Loud Like Love TV&quot;, on their official YouTube channel. The show featured interviews with the band and their collaborators, live performances and behind the scenes content.

Brian Molko described the recording of the album as a positive experience, commenting:

...I see this record as a collection of 10 small fictions, based on my own experience and my own feelings around relationships over the past 20 years, I feel that I&#x27;ve been able to use the device [of] storytelling, which I think I&#x27;ve become a little bit more adept at, create songs with characters. Paradoxically, because of that, I&#x27;ve been able to be more honest, more direct and more personal.


In November–December 2013, the band went on an arena tour in Europe and the United Kingdom to promote the new album. During February–April 2014 Placebo toured Australia, Mexico and South America. Beginning in June 2014, they went on a tour in Russia and Europe. In October 2014, they went on their first full tour of the United States and Canada in six years.

On 2 February 2015, the band announced the departure of drummer Steve Forrest. The end of Forrest&#x27;s career with the band was &quot;very amicable&quot; and occurred due to the drummer&#x27;s intention to &quot;pursue his own musical ambitions&quot;. Placebo announced that for the planned 2015 gigs a new sideman, Matt Lunn, formerly of the band Colour of Fire, who supported Placebo on tour in 2004, would take the drummer&#x27;s seat. Lunn continued to perform with Placebo during the &quot;A Place for Us to Dream&quot; tour.

On 12 February, Placebo announced that they would stream their entire back catalogue for the first time in their history.

In February–March 2015, Placebo toured Ireland and the United Kingdom, culminating with two shows in London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo. During May–July 2015 they toured Europe, Morocco, Russia and Georgia. During the Morocco concert, bassist Stefan Olsdal, who is openly gay, appeared 
shirtless, having the number 489 crossed out on his torso, as a protest against Article 489 of the Moroccan Criminal Code, which punishes same-sex relationships with imprisonment. Olsdal also used a rainbow guitar on stage, the rainbow being a well-known LGBT symbol.

===20 Years of Placebo and &quot;A Place for Us to Dream&quot; (2015–2018)===
Marking twenty years since the release of their debut album, Placebo announced in June 2015 the re-release of their first five albums on 12&quot; coloured vinyl.

On 19 August 2015, Placebo performed an MTV Unplugged concert in London. The setlist for this performance consisted of many older Placebo songs, some of them not played live in a decade. On 27 November 2015, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was released on CD, DVD, Blu-ray and vinyl.

In March 2016, Placebo announced the anniversary tour &quot;A Place for Us to Dream – 20 Years of Placebo&quot;, with the first dates scheduled for December 2016 in the UK and Ireland. Molko stated that the setlist would include songs that he had sworn never to play again, adding: &quot;This tour is very much for the fans and a chance for us to revisit a lot of our early material. So, if you want to see us play songs like &#x27;Pure Morning&#x27; and &#x27;Nancy Boy&#x27; which we haven&#x27;t played in almost ten years and may not play again, then you&#x27;d better come along to these shows!&quot;

&quot;Alt.Russia&quot;, a documentary containing scenes from the 2014 Placebo tour in Russia, was released on 10 May 2016. Narrated by Stefan Olsdal, the documentary was also a commentary towards the contemporary social and political issues in Russia, especially homophobia.

On 4 August 2016, Placebo announced the release of a compilation album, &quot;A Place for Us to Dream&quot; and of an EP, &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot;, collecting previously unreleased material. The compilation album and the EP were both released on 7 October 2016. Both contained the new single &quot;Jesus&#x27; Son&quot;, which was released on 19 August 2016, accompanied by a music video.

On 7 October 2016, the band also released a video for the song &quot;Every You Every Me&quot;, filmed in 1998 but never shown before to the public.

The band kicked off their 20 Years of Placebo tour in Aarhus, Denmark. The concert was abruptly cut short, however, already two songs into the set, as Molko became incoherent and had to be removed from the stage. An official statement from the band explained that Molko had an adverse reaction to new medication. The tour continued in the next evenings without incidents, the band receiving positive reviews for their performances. During October–November 2016, the band toured Europe and Russia. Placebo&#x27;s December 2016 concerts in the UK and Ireland featured shoegaze supergroup Minor Victories as the opening act.

In March–April 2017, Placebo toured Mexico. During April–August 2017, they played a string of gigs across Europe, including appearances at Greece&#x27;s Rockwave Festival and the UK&#x27;s Latitude Festival. In September 2017, Placebo performed seven shows in Australia. In October 2017, they embarked on a tour of the UK, ending with two shows at the Brixton Academy on 23 and 24 October 2017.

Placebo have participated in the 2018 Meltdown Festival, held at Southbank Centre in June 2018. The festival was curated by long-time Placebo collaborator Robert Smith. In June and July 2018, the band also went on four dates in Italy, Ukraine and Switzerland.

===&quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (2019–present)===
On 25 July 2019, Olsdal revealed that Placebo are working on their eighth studio album. In January 2020, Placebo announced a new tour, including festival shows during June–July 2020 in Greece, Spain, Belgium, Ukraine and Russia. In March 2020, Olsdal announced that he and Molko had to put finishing their eighth studio album on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and London being on lockdown, via a post on his official Instagram. On 15 September 2020, Dave McLean, one of Placebo&#x27;s managers at RIVERMAN, tweeted their eighth studio album would be released in early 2021. On 13 September 2021 an announcement was made that the band will release a new single titled &quot;Beautiful James&quot; on 17 September 2021.

On 4 November 2021, Placebo announced their eighth studio album, &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot;. It was released on 25 March 2022 on the indie label So Recordings. On 23 March 2022, Placebo embarked on the &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; tour, starting with four intimate shows across Europe, followed by an extensive headline expedition, including, among other places, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

On 7 September 2022, Placebo released a cover of the song &quot;Shout&quot; by Tears for Fears.

==Musical style, influences and lyrics==
Placebo&#x27;s music has typically been labeled as alternative rock. They have, however, also incorporated different sounds in their music throughout their career. Critics have also described the band&#x27;s sound as pop punk, industrial rock, Britpop, glam rock, gothic rock, electronic rock, post-punk revival, and experimental rock. Progressive rock elements in the band&#x27;s earlier works along with grunge and punk rock influences were also noted.

Placebo&#x27;s influences include David Bowie, Can, Iggy Pop and the Stooges, Sonic Youth, the Cure, Pixies, Nirvana, the Smiths, PJ Harvey, Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails.

Lyrically, Placebo&#x27;s music contains many references to drugs and sexuality. The title of the song &quot;Special K&quot;, for instance, is slang for ketamine. Molko has been open about his use of recreational drugs: in a 1997 interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine he admitted that heroin was &quot;probably the only drug on this planet I haven&#x27;t tried&quot;. However, he later admitted to using heroin as well. Pharmaceutical drugs are also referenced, as evidenced by the band&#x27;s name as well as the album &quot;Meds&quot; and its title track. Molko admitted in 2003 that many of his initial excesses were due to his mental issues; he was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder in his late twenties. The singer claimed in 2016 that he gave up drugs completely after the recording and release of &quot;Meds&quot;.

Outsider themes are also explored, as evidenced in lyrics such as &quot;the back of the class is where I&#x27;m from&quot; on &quot;One of a Kind&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m forever black-eyed/A product of a broken home&quot; on &quot;Black-Eyed&quot;. Molko has been quoted as calling the band &quot;for outsiders, by outsiders&quot;.

===Feud with Limp Bizkit===
A feud between Limp Bizkit and Placebo began at a show frontman Fred Durst was hosting at Irving Plaza in December 1998. A side stage spat with Molko led to Durst asking the crowd to chant &quot;Placebo sucks!&quot; prior to Placebo&#x27;s performance. Molko later commented that nobody had told him that Durst would be hosting the show and that Placebo would have to follow opening act Kid Rock. Prior to introducing Staind as a part of K-Rock’s Dysfunctional Family Picnic in Holmdel, New Jersey in 1999, Durst once again encouraged the crowd to chant &quot;Fuck Placebo&quot;. The feud was reignited during Big Day Out 2001, on which Placebo were billed below Limp Bizkit after Hewitt acknowledged the animosity between both bands and claimed Limp Bizkit “was guilty of spreading negativity”. By 2004, the feud had reportedly ended.

<doc id="241265" wikidata="Q1673227" url="?curid=241265" title="Moral skepticism">
<text>Moral skepticism (or moral scepticism in British English) is a class of meta-ethical theories all members of which entail that no one has any moral knowledge. Many moral skeptics also make the stronger, modal claim that moral knowledge is impossible. Moral skepticism is particularly opposed to moral realism: the view that there are knowable and objective moral truths.

Some defenders of moral skepticism include Pyrrho, Aenesidemus, Sextus Empiricus, David Hume, J. L. Mackie (1977), Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Joyce (2001), Joshua Greene, Richard Garner, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong (2006b), and the philosopher James Flynn. Strictly speaking, Gilbert Harman (1975) argues in favor of a kind of moral relativism, not moral skepticism. However, he has influenced some contemporary moral skeptics.

==Forms of moral skepticism==
Moral skepticism is divided into three subclasses: moral error theory (or moral nihilism), epistemological moral skepticism, and noncognitivism. All three of these theories reach the same conclusions, which are:

:(a) we are never justified in believing that moral claims (claims of the form &quot;state of affairs x is (morally) good,&quot; &quot;action y is morally obligatory,&quot; etc.) are true, and, furthermore,
:(b) we never know that any moral claim is true.

However, each method arrives at (a) and (b) by a different route.

Moral error theory holds that we do not know that any moral claim is true because
:(i) all moral claims are false,
:(ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false, and
:(iii) since we are not justified in believing any claim we have reason to deny, we are not justified in believing any moral claims.

Epistemological moral skepticism is a subclass of theory, the members of which include Pyrrhonian moral skepticism and dogmatic moral skepticism. All members of epistemological moral skepticism share two things: first, they acknowledge that we are unjustified in believing any moral claim, and second, they are agnostic on whether (i) is true (i.e. on whether all moral claims are false).
* Pyrrhonian moral skepticism holds that the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim is that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral claim is true or that any moral claim is false. Thus, in addition to being agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).
* Dogmatic moral skepticism, on the other hand, &quot;affirms&quot; (ii) and cites (ii)&#x27;s truth as the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral claim.

Finally, noncognitivism holds that we can never know that any moral claim is true because moral claims are &quot;incapable&quot; of being true or false (they are not truth-apt). Instead, moral claims are imperatives (e.g. &quot;Don&#x27;t steal babies!&quot;), expressions of emotion (e.g. &quot;stealing babies: Boo!&quot;), or expressions of &quot;pro-attitudes&quot; (&quot;I do not believe that babies should be stolen.&quot;)

==Moral error theory==
Moral error theory is a position characterized by its commitment to two propositions: (i) all moral claims are false and (ii) we have reason to believe that all moral claims are false. The most famous moral error theorist is J. L. Mackie, who defended the metaethical view in &quot;Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong&quot; (1977). Mackie has been interpreted as giving two arguments for moral error theory.

The first argument people attribute to Mackie, often called the argument from queerness, holds that moral claims imply motivation internalism (the doctrine that &quot;It is necessary and &quot;a priori&quot; that any agent who judges that one of his available actions is morally obligatory will have some (defeasible) motivation to perform that action&quot;). Because motivation internalism is false, however, so too are all moral claims.

The other argument often attributed to Mackie, often called the argument from disagreement, maintains that any moral claim (e.g. &quot;Killing babies is wrong&quot;) entails a correspondent &quot;reasons claim&quot; (&quot;one has reason not to kill babies&quot;). Put another way, if &quot;killing babies is wrong&quot; is true then everybody has a reason to not kill babies. This includes the psychopath who takes great pleasure from killing babies, and is utterly miserable when he does not have their blood on his hands. But, surely, (if we assume that he will suffer no reprisals) this psychopath has every reason to kill babies, and no reason not to do so. All moral claims are thus false.

==Epistemological moral skepticism==
All versions of epistemological moral skepticism hold that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. However, in contradistinction to moral error theory, epistemological moral skeptical arguments for this conclusion do not include the premise that &quot;all moral claims are false.&quot; For example, Michael Ruse gives what Richard Joyce calls an &quot;evolutionary argument&quot; for the conclusion that we are unjustified in believing any moral proposition. He argues that we have evolved to believe moral propositions because our believing the same enhances our genetic fitness (makes it more likely that we will reproduce successfully). However, our believing these propositions would enhance our fitness even if they were all false (they would make us more cooperative, etc.). Thus, our moral beliefs are unresponsive to evidence; they are analogous to the beliefs of a paranoiac. As a paranoiac is plainly unjustified in believing his conspiracy theories, so too are we unjustified in believing moral propositions. We therefore have reason to jettison our moral beliefs.

Nietzsche&#x27;s moral skepticism centers on the profound and ongoing lack of consensus among philosophers regarding foundational moral propositions. He highlights the persistent debates on whether the basis of right action is rooted in reasons or consequences, and the diverse, conflicting theories within Western moral philosophy. 

== Noncognitivism ==
==Criticisms==

Criticisms of moral skepticism come primarily from moral realists. The moral realist argues that there is in fact good reason to believe that there are objective moral truths and that we are justified in holding many moral beliefs. One moral realist response to moral error theory holds that it &quot;proves too much&quot;—if moral claims are false because they entail that we have reasons to do certain things regardless of our preferences, then so too are &quot;hypothetical imperatives&quot; (e.g. &quot;if you want to get your hair-cut you ought to go to the barber&quot;). This is because all hypothetical imperatives imply that &quot;we have reason to do that which will enable us to accomplish our ends&quot; and so, like moral claims, they imply that we have reason to do something &quot;regardless&quot; of our preferences.

If moral claims are false because they have this implication, then so too are hypothetical imperatives. But hypothetical imperatives are true. Thus the argument from the non-instantiation of (what Mackie terms) &quot;objective prescriptivity&quot; for moral error theory fails. Russ Shafer-Landau and Daniel Callcut have each outlined anti-skeptical strategies. Callcut argues that moral skepticism should be scrutinized in introductory ethics classes in order to get across the point that &quot;if all views about morality, including the skeptical ones, face difficulties, then adopting a skeptical position is not an escape from difficulty.&quot;

<doc id="241267" wikidata="Q209499" url="?curid=241267" title="12-hour clock">
<text>The 12-hour clock is a time convention in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two periods: a.m. (from Latin &#x27;, translating to &quot;before midday&quot;) and p.m. (from Latin &#x27;, translating to &quot;after midday&quot;). Each period consists of 12 hours numbered: 12 (acting as 0), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. The 12-hour clock has been developed since the second millennium BC and reached its modern form in the 16th century. 

The 12-hour time convention is common in several English-speaking nations and former British colonies, as well as a few other countries. There is no widely accepted convention for how midday and midnight should be represented: in English-speaking countries, &quot;12 p.m.&quot; indicates 12 o&#x27;clock noon, while &quot;12 a.m.&quot; means 12 o&#x27;clock midnight. 

==History and use==

The natural day-and-night division of a calendar day forms the fundamental basis as to why each day is split into two cycles. Originally there were two cycles: one cycle which could be tracked by the position of the Sun (day), followed by one cycle which could be tracked by the Moon and stars (night). This eventually evolved into the two 12-hour periods which are used today, one called &quot;a.m.&quot; starting at midnight and another called &quot;p.m.&quot; starting at noon. Noon itself is rarely abbreviated today; but if it is, it is denoted &quot;m.&quot;

The 12-hour clock can be traced back as far as Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. Both an Egyptian sundial for daytime use and an Egyptian water clock for night-time use were found in the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep I. Dating to , these clocks divided their respective times of use into 12 hours each.

The Romans also used a 12-hour clock: daylight was divided into 12 equal hours (thus hours having varying length throughout the year) and the night was divided into four watches.

The first mechanical clocks in the 14th century, if they had dials at all, showed all 24 hours using the 24-hour analog dial, influenced by astronomers&#x27; familiarity with the astrolabe and sundial and by their desire to model the Earth&#x27;s apparent motion around the Sun. In Northern Europe these dials generally used the 12-hour numbering scheme in Roman numerals but showed both &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; periods in sequence. This is known as the double-XII system and can be seen on many surviving clock faces, such as those at Wells and Exeter.

Elsewhere in Europe, numbering was more likely to be based on the 24-hour system (I to XXIV). The 12-hour clock was used throughout the British empire.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, the 12-hour analog dial and time system gradually became established as standard throughout Northern Europe for general public use. The 24-hour analog dial was reserved for more specialized applications, such as astronomical clocks and chronometers.

Most analog clocks and watches today use the 12-hour dial, on which the shorter hour hand rotates once every 12 hours and twice in one day. Some analog clock dials have an inner ring of numbers along with the standard 1-to-12 numbered ring. The number 12 is paired either with a 00 or a 24, while the numbers 1 through 11 are paired with the numbers 13 through 23, respectively. This modification allows the clock to also be read in 24-hour notation. This kind of 12-hour clock can be found in countries where the 24-hour clock is preferred.

===Use by country===

In several countries the 12-hour clock is the dominant written and spoken system of time, predominantly in nations that were part of the former British Empire, for example, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, the United States, Canada (excluding Quebec), Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, and others follow this convention as well, such as Mexico and the former American colony of the Philippines. Even in those countries where the 12-hour clock is predominant, there are frequently contexts (such as science, medicine, the military or transport) in which the 24-hour clock is preferred. In most countries, however, the 24-hour clock is the standard system used, especially in writing. Some nations in Europe and Latin America use a combination of the two, preferring the 12-hour system in colloquial speech but using the 24-hour system in written form and in formal contexts.

The 12-hour clock in speech often uses phrases such as&quot; ... in the morning&quot;,&quot; ... in the afternoon&quot;,&quot; ... in the evening&quot;, and &quot;... at night&quot;. &quot;Rider&#x27;s British Merlin&quot; almanac for 1795 and a similar almanac for 1773 published in London used them. Other than in English-speaking countries and some Spanish-speaking countries, the terms &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; are seldom used and often unknown.

===Computer support===
In most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. Most operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS, activate the 12-hour notation by default for a limited number of language and region settings. This behaviour can be changed by the user, such as with the Windows operating system&#x27;s &quot;Region and Language&quot; settings.

==Abbreviations==

The Latin abbreviations &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; (often written &quot;am&quot; and &quot;pm&quot;, &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;PM&quot;, or &quot;A.M.&quot; and &quot;P.M.&quot;) are used in English and Spanish. The equivalents in Greek are and , respectively, and in Sinhala () for (, – fore, pre) and () for (,  – after, post). However, noon is rarely abbreviated in either of these languages, noon normally being written in full. In Portuguese, there are two official options and many others used, for example, using 21:45, 21h45 or 21h45min (official ones) or 21:45 or 9:45 p.m. In Irish, &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;i.n.&quot; are used, standing for &quot;ar maidin&quot; (&quot;in the morning&quot;) and &quot;iarnóin&quot; (&quot;afternoon&quot;) respectively.

Most other languages lack formal abbreviations for &quot;before noon&quot; and &quot;after noon&quot;, and their users use the 12-hour clock only orally and informally. However, in many languages, such as Russian and Hebrew, informal designations are used, such as &quot;9 in the morning&quot; or &quot;3 in the night&quot;.

When abbreviations and phrases are omitted, one may rely on sentence context and societal norms to reduce ambiguity. For example, if one commutes to work at &quot;9:00&quot;, 9:00 a.m. may be implied, but if a social dance is scheduled to begin at &quot;9:00&quot;, it may begin at 9:00 p.m.

==Related conventions==

===Typography===
The terms &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; are abbreviations of the Latin (before midday) and (after midday). Depending on the style guide referenced, the abbreviations &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; are variously written in small capitals (&quot; and &quot;), uppercase letters without a period (&quot;AM&quot; and &quot;PM&quot;), uppercase letters with periods, or lowercase letters (&quot;am&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; or &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot;). With the advent of computer generated and printed schedules, especially airlines, advertising, and television promotions, the &quot;M&quot; character is often omitted as providing no additional information as in &quot;9:30A&quot; or &quot;10:00P&quot;.

Some style guides suggest the use of a space between the number and the a.m. or p.m. abbreviation. Style guides recommend not using a.m. and p.m. without a time preceding it.

The hour/minute separator varies between countries: some use a colon, others use a period (full stop), and still others use the letter h. (In some usages, particularly &quot;military time&quot;, of the 24-hour clock, there is no separator between hours and minutes. This style is not generally seen when the 12-hour clock is used.)

=== Encoding ===
Unicode specifies codepoints for &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; as precomposed characters, which are intended to be used only with Chinese-Japanese-Korean (CJK) character sets, as they take up exactly the same space as one CJK character: 
* 

===Informal speech and rounding off===
In speaking, it is common to round the time to the nearest five minutes and/or express the time as the past (or to) the closest hour; for example, &quot;five past five&quot; (5:05). Minutes &quot;past&quot; the hour means those minutes are added to the hour; &quot;ten past five&quot; means 5:10. Minutes &quot;to, &#x27;til&quot; and &quot;of&quot; the hour mean those minutes are subtracted; &quot;ten of five&quot;, &quot;ten &#x27;til five&quot;, and &quot;ten to five&quot; all mean 4:50.

Fifteen minutes is often called a &quot;quarter hour&quot;, and thirty minutes is often known as a &quot;half hour&quot;. For example, 5:15 can be phrased &quot;(a) quarter past five&quot; or &quot;five-fifteen&quot;; 5:30 can be &quot;half past five&quot;, &quot;five-thirty&quot; or simply &quot;half five&quot;. The time 8:45 may be spoken as &quot;eight forty-five&quot; or &quot;(a) quarter to nine&quot;.

In older English, it was common for the number 25 to be expressed as &quot;five-and-twenty&quot;. In this way the time 8:35 may be phrased as &quot;five-and-twenty to 9&quot;, although this styling fell out of fashion in the later part of the 1900s and is now rarely used.

Instead of meaning 5:30, the &quot;half five&quot; expression is sometimes used to mean 4:30, or &quot;halfway to five&quot;, especially for regions such as the American Midwest and other areas that have been particularly influenced by German culture. This meaning follows the pattern choices of many Germanic and Slavic languages, including Serbo-Croatian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Norwegian, and Swedish, as well as Hungarian, Finnish, and the languages of the Baltic States.

Moreover, in situations where the relevant hour is obvious or has been recently mentioned, a speaker might omit the hour and just say &quot;quarter to (the hour)&quot;, &quot;half past&quot; or &quot;ten &#x27;til&quot; to avoid an elaborate sentence in informal conversations. These forms are often commonly used in television and radio broadcasts that cover multiple time zones at one-hour intervals.

In describing a vague time of day, a speaker might say the phrase &quot;seven-thirty, eight&quot; to mean sometime around 7:30 or 8:00. Such phrasing can be misinterpreted for a specific time of day (here 7:38), especially by a listener not expecting an estimation. The phrase &quot;&quot;about&quot; seven-thirty &quot;or&quot; eight&quot; clarifies this.

Some more ambiguous phrasing might be avoided. Within five minutes of the hour, the phrase &quot;five of seven&quot; (6:55) can be heard &quot;five-oh-seven&quot; (5:07). &quot;Five &quot;to&quot; seven&quot; or even &quot;six fifty-five&quot; clarifies this.

===Formal speech and times to the minute===
Minutes may be expressed as an exact number of minutes past the hour specifying the time of day (e.g., 6:32 p.m. is &quot;six thirty-two&quot;). Additionally, when expressing the time using the &quot;past (after)&quot; or &quot;to (before)&quot; formula, it is conventional to choose the number of minutes below 30 (e.g., 6:32 p.m. is conventionally &quot;twenty-eight minutes to seven&quot; rather than &quot;thirty-two minutes past six&quot;).

In spoken English, full hours are often represented by the numbered hour followed by (10:00 as &quot;ten o&#x27;clock&quot;, 2:00 as &quot;two o&#x27;clock&quot;). This may be followed by the &quot;a.m.&quot; or &quot;p.m.&quot; designator, though some phrases such as &quot;in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening,&quot; or &quot;at night&quot; more commonly follow analog-style terms such as &quot;o&#x27;clock, half past three,&quot; and &quot;quarter to four. O&#x27;clock&quot; itself may be omitted, telling a time as &quot;four a.m.&quot; or &quot;four p.m.&quot; Minutes &quot;:01&quot; to &quot;:09&quot; are usually pronounced as &quot;oh one&quot; to &quot;oh nine&quot; (&quot;nought&quot; or &quot;zero&quot; can also be used instead of &quot;oh&quot;). Minutes &quot;:10&quot; to &quot;:59&quot; are pronounced as their usual number-words. For instance, 6:02 a.m. can be pronounced &quot;six oh two a.m.&quot; whereas 6:32 a.m. could be told as &quot;six thirty-two a.m.&quot;.

==Confusion at noon and midnight==
It is not always clear what times &quot;12:00 a.m.&quot; and &quot;12:00 p.m.&quot; denote. From the Latin words (midday), &quot;ante&quot; (before) and &quot;post&quot; (after), the term &#x27; (a.m.) means before midday and &#x27; (p.m.) means after midday. Since &quot;noon&quot; (midday, (m.)) is neither before nor after itself, the terms a.m. and p.m. do not apply. Although &quot;12 m.&quot; was suggested as a way to indicate noon, this is seldom done and also does not resolve the question of how to indicate midnight.

&quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language&quot; states &quot;By convention, &quot;12 AM&quot; denotes midnight and &quot;12 PM&quot; denotes noon. Because of the potential for confusion, it is advisable to use &quot;12 noon&quot; and &quot;12 midnight&quot;&quot;.

E. G. Richards in his book &quot;Mapping Time&quot; (1999) provided a diagram in which 12 a.m. means noon and 12 p.m. means midnight.

Historically, the style manual of the United States Government Printing Office used 12 a.m. for noon and 12 p.m. for midnight until its 2008 edition. At this point it reversed these designations and then retained that change in its 2016 revision.

Many U.S. style guides, and NIST&#x27;s &quot;Frequently asked questions (FAQ)&quot; web page, recommend that it is clearest if one refers to &quot;noon&quot; or &quot;12:00 noon&quot; and &quot;midnight&quot; or &quot;12:00 midnight&quot; (rather than to &quot;12:00 p.m.&quot; and &quot;12:00 a.m.&quot;). The NIST website states that &quot;12 a.m. and 12 p.m. are ambiguous and should not be used.&quot;

&quot;The Associated Press Stylebook&quot; specifies that midnight &quot;is part of the day that is ending, not the one that is beginning.&quot;

&quot;The Canadian Press Stylebook&quot; says, &quot;write &quot;noon&quot; or &quot;midnight&quot;, not &quot;12 noon&quot; or &quot;12 midnight&quot;.&quot; Phrases such as &quot;12 a.m.&quot; and &quot;12 p.m.&quot; are not mentioned at all. 

In the UK, the National Physical Laboratory &quot;FAQ-Time&quot; web page states &quot;In cases where the context cannot be relied upon to place a particular event, the pair of days straddling midnight can be quoted&quot;; also &quot;the terms 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. should be avoided.&quot;

Likewise, some U.S. style guides recommend either clarifying &quot;midnight&quot; with other context clues, such as specifying the two dates between which it falls, or not referring to the term at all. For an example of the latter method, &quot;midnight&quot; is replaced with &quot;11:59 p.m.&quot; for the end of a day or &quot;12:01 a.m.&quot; for the start of a day. That has become common in the United States in legal contracts and for airplane, bus, or train schedules, though some schedules use other conventions. Occasionally, when trains run at regular intervals, the pattern may be broken at midnight by displacing the midnight departure one or more minutes, such as to 11:59 p.m. or 12:01 a.m.

In Japanese usage, midnight is written as (0 a.m.) and noon is written as (0 p.m.), making the hours numbered sequentially from 0 to 11 in both halves of the day. Alternatively, noon may be written as (12 a.m.) and midnight at the end of the day as (12 p.m.), as opposed to (0 a.m.) for the start of the day, making the Japanese convention the opposite of the English usage of 12 a.m. and 12 p.m.

<text>In publishing, a colophon () is a brief statement containing information about the publication of a book such as an &quot;imprint&quot; (the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication). 

A colophon may include the device (logo) of a printer or publisher. Colophons are traditionally printed at the ends of books (see History below for the origin of the word), but sometimes the same information appears elsewhere (when it may still be referred to as colophon) and many modern (post-1800) books bear this information on the title page or on the verso of the title leaf, which is sometimes called a &quot;biblio page&quot; or (when bearing copyright data) the &quot;copyright page&quot;.

==History==

The term &quot;colophon&quot; derives from the Late Latin &quot;colophōn&quot;, from the Greek κολοφών (meaning &quot;summit&quot; or &quot;finishing touch&quot;).

The term colophon was used in 1729 as the bibliographic explication at the end of the book by the English printer Samuel Palmer in his &quot;The General History of Printing, from Its first Invention in the City of Mentz to Its first Progress and Propagation thro&#x27; the most celebrated Cities in Europe.&quot; Thereafter, colophon has been the common designation for the final page that gives details of the physical creation of the book.

The existence of colophons can be traced back to antiquity. Zetzel, for example, describes an inscription from the 2nd century A.D., preserved in humanistic manuscripts. He cites the colophon from Poggio&#x27;s manuscript, a humanist from the 15th century:
&quot;Statili(us) / maximus rursum em(en)daui ad tyrone(m) et laecanianu(m) et dom̅ &amp; alios ueteres. III.&quot; (&quot;‘I, Statilius Maximus, have for the second time revised the text according to Tiro, Laecanianus, Domitius and three others.’&quot;)

A common colophon at the end of hand copied manuscripts was simply &quot;Finished, thank God.&quot;

Colophons can be categorized into four groups. 

; Assertive
: Provide the contextual information about the scribe and manuscript
; Expressive
: Demonstrate the scribe&#x27;s feelings and wishes
; Directive
: Make the reader do something
; Declarative
: Do something with the reader

Examples of &quot;expressive&quot; colophons:

* &quot;I have made an end at last, and my weary hand can rest.&quot;
* &quot;Now that I an end have made, See that what I&#x27;m owed is paid.&quot;
* &quot;May the writer continue to copy, and drink good wine.&quot; 

Example of a &quot;directive&quot; colophon:

* &quot;O beatissime lector, lava manus tuas et sic librum adprehende, leniter folia turna, longe a littera digitos pone&quot;. (&quot;O most gracious reader, wash your hands and touch the book only like this: turn the pages softly and keep your fingers far away from the text&quot;.)

Example of a &quot;declarative&quot; colophon:

* &quot;Si quis et hunc sancti sumit de culmine Galli / Hunc Gallus Paulusque simul dent pestibus amplis&quot; (&quot;If anybody takes this book from Gall’s estate, Gall and Paulus together shall inflict the plague upon him&quot;.)

The term is also applied to clay tablet inscriptions appended by a scribe to the end of an Ancient Near East (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Early/Middle/Late Babylonian, Assyrian, Canaanite) text such as a chapter, book, manuscript, or record. The colophon usually contained facts relative to the text such as associated person(s) (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the scribe, owner, or commissioner of the tablet), literary contents (&quot;e.g.&quot;, a title, &quot;catch phrases&quot; (repeated phrases), or number of lines), and occasion or purpose of writing. Colophons and catch phrases helped the reader organize and identify various tablets, and keep related tablets together. Positionally, colophons on ancient tablets are comparable to a signature line in modern times. Bibliographically, however, they more closely resemble the imprint page in a modern book.

Examples of colophons in ancient literature may be found in the compilation &quot;The Ancient Near East: Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament&quot; (2nd ed., 1969). Colophons are also found in the Pentateuch, where an understanding of this ancient literary convention illuminates passages that are otherwise unclear or incoherent. Examples are Numbers 3:1, where a later (and incorrect) chapter division makes this verse a heading for the following chapter instead of interpreting it properly as a colophon or summary for the preceding two chapters, and Genesis 37:2a, a colophon that concludes the histories (&quot;toledot&quot;) of Jacob.

An extensive study of the eleven colophons found in the book of Genesis was done by Percy John Wiseman. Wiseman&#x27;s study of the Genesis colophons, sometimes described as the Wiseman hypothesis, has a detailed examination of the catch phrases mentioned above that were used in literature of the second millennium B.C. and earlier in tying together the various accounts in a series of tablets.

==Printed books==

In early printed books the colophon, when present, was a brief description of the printing and publication of the book, giving some or all of the following data: the date of publication, the place of publication or printing (sometimes including the address as well as the city name), the name(s) of the printer(s), and the name(s) of the publisher(s), if different. Sometimes additional information, such as the name of a proofreader or editor, or other more-or-less relevant details, might be added. A colophon might also be emblematic or pictorial rather than in words. The normal position for a colophon was after the explicit (the end of the text, often after any index or register).

Colophons sometimes contained book curses, as this was the one place in a medieval manuscript where a scribe was free to write what he wished. Such curses tend to be unique to each book.

After around 1500 these data were often transferred to the title page, which sometimes existed in parallel with a colophon, so that colophons grew generally less common in the 16th century. 

The statements of printing which appeared, under the terms of the Unlawful Societies Act 1799 (39 Geo. 3. c. 79), on the verso of the title leaf and final page of each book printed in Great Britain in the 19th century are not, strictly speaking, colophons, and are better referred to as &quot;printers&#x27; imprints&quot; or &quot;printer statements&quot;.

In some parts of the world, colophons helped fledgling printers and printing companies gain social recognition. For example, in early modern Armenia printers used colophons as a way to gain &quot;prestige power&quot; by getting their name out into the social sphere. The use of colophons in early modern Armenian print culture is significant as well because it signaled the rate of decline in manuscript production and scriptoria use, and conversely the rise and perpetuation of printing for Armenians.

With the development of the private press movement from around 1890, colophons became conventional in private press books, and often included a good deal of additional information on the book, including statements of limitation, data on paper, ink, type, and binding, and other technical details. Some such books include a separate &quot;Note about the type&quot;, which will identify the names of the primary typefaces used, provide a brief description of the type&#x27;s history, and a brief statement about its most identifiable physical characteristics.

Some commercial publishers took up the use of colophons and began to include similar details in their books, either at the end of the text (the traditional position) or on the verso of the title leaf. Such colophons might identify the book&#x27;s designer, the software used, the printing method, the printing company, the typeface(s) used in the page design and the kind of ink, paper, and its cotton content. Book publishers Alfred A. Knopf, the Folio Society and O&#x27;Reilly Media are notable for their substantial colophons.

==Websites==
Some web pages also have colophons, which frequently contain (X)HTML, CSS, or usability standards compliance information and links to website validation tests.

<doc id="241269" wikidata="Q44210" url="?curid=241269" title="Córdoba, Argentina">
<text>Córdoba () is a city in central Argentina, in the foothills of the Sierras Chicas on the Suquía River, about northwest of Buenos Aires. It is the capital of Córdoba Province and the second-most populous city in Argentina after Buenos Aires, with about 1.6 million urban inhabitants .

Córdoba was founded as a settlement on 6 July 1573 by Spanish conquistador Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera, who named it after the Spanish city of Córdoba. It was one of the early Spanish colonial capitals of the region of present-day Argentina (the oldest Argentine city is Santiago del Estero, founded in 1553). The National University of Córdoba, the oldest university of the country, was founded in 1613 by the Jesuit Order, and Córdoba has earned the nickname (&quot;the learned&quot;).

Córdoba has many historical monuments preserved from the period of Spanish colonial rule, especially buildings of the Catholic Church such as the Jesuit Block (Spanish: &quot;Manzana Jesuítica&quot;), declared in 2000 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, which consists of a group of buildings dating from the 17th century, including the Colegio Nacional de Monserrat and the colonial university campus. The campus belongs today to the historical museum of the National University of Córdoba, which has been the second-largest university in the country since the early years of the 20th century (after the University of Buenos Aires), in number of students, faculty, and academic programs. Córdoba is also known for its historical movements, such as the Cordobazo of May 1969 and (known as the University Revolution in English) of 1918.

==History==
===Early settlements===

In 1570 the Viceroy of Peru, Francisco de Toledo, entrusted the Spanish settler Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera with the task of founding and populating a settlement in the Punilla Valley. Cabrera sent an expedition of 48 men to the territory of the Comechingones. He divided the principal column that entered through the north of the provincial territory at Villa María.
The expedition of one hundred men set foot on what today is Córdoba on 24 June 1573. Cabrera called the nearby river San Juan (today Suquía). The settlement was officially founded on 6 July of the same year and named , possibly in honour of ancestors of the founder&#x27;s wife, who originally came from Córdoba, Spain. The foundation of the city took place on the left bank of the river on the advice of Francisco de Torres.
The area was inhabited by aboriginal people called Comechingones, who lived in communities called &quot;ayllus&quot;. After four years, having repelled attacks by the aborigines, the settlement&#x27;s authorities moved it to the opposite bank of the Suquía River in 1577. The Lieutenant Governor at the time, Don Lorenzo Suárez de Figueroa, planned the first layout of the city as a grid of 70 blocks. Once the city core had been moved to its current location, the population stabilized. The city&#x27;s economy blossomed due to trade with the cities in the north.

In 1599, the religious order of the Jesuits arrived in the settlement. They established a Novitiate in 1608 and, in 1610, the Colegio Maximo, which became the University of Córdoba in 1613 (today National University of Córdoba), the fourth-oldest in the Americas. The local Jesuit church remains one of the oldest buildings in South America and contains the Monserrat Secondary School, a church, and residential buildings. To maintain such a project, the Jesuits operated five &quot;Reducciones&quot; in the surrounding fertile valleys, including Caroya, Jesús María, Santa Catalina, Alta Gracia and Candelaria.

The farm and the complex (started in 1615, had to be vacated by the Jesuits following the 1767 decree by King Charles III of Spain that expelled the Jesuit order from the continent. Franciscans then operated the Jesuits&#x27; foundations until 1853, when the Jesuits returned to the Americas. Nevertheless, the university and the high-school were nationalized a year later.
Each estancia has its own church and set of buildings, around which towns grew, such as Alta Gracia, the closest to the Block.

===Early European settlement===

In 1776, King Carlos III created the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, in which Córdoba stays in 1785 as the Government Intendency of Córdoba, including the current territories of the provinces of Córdoba, La Rioja and the region of Cuyo.

According to the 1760 census, the population of the city was 22,000 inhabitants. During the May Revolution in 1810, the widespread opinion of the most notable citizens was of continuing respecting the orders of Fernando VII, attitude assumed by the local authorities, which led to the Liniers Counter-revolution. This position was not shared by the Dean Gregorio Funes, who was adhering to the revolutionary ideas, beside supporting contact with Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli.

In March 1816, the Argentine Congress met in Tucumán for an independence resolution. Córdoba sent Eduardo Pérez Bulnes, Jerónimo Salguero de Cabrera, José Antonio Cabrera, and to the Canon of the cathedral Michael Calixto of the Circle, all of them of autonomous position.

The 1820s belonged to caudillos, since the country was in full process of formation. Until 1820 a central government taken root in Buenos Aires existed, but the remaining thirteen provinces felt that after 9 July 1816 what had happened it was simply a change of commander. The Battle of Cepeda pitted the commanders of the Littoral against the inland forces.

Finally, the Federales obtained the victory, for what the country remained since then integrated by 13 autonomous provinces, on the national government having been dissolved.
From this way the period known like about the Provincial Autonomies began. From this moment the provinces tried to create a federal system that was integrating them without coming to good port, this mainly for the regional differences of every province.

Two Córdoba figures stood out in this period: Governor Juan Bautista Bustos, who was an official of the Army of the North and in 1820 was supervised by the troops quartered in Arequito, a town near Córdoba, and his ally and later enemy, General José María Paz. In 1821, Bustos repelled the invasion of Córdoba on the part of Francisco Ramírez and his Chilean ally, General José Miguel Carrera. The conflict originated in a dispute with the power system that included the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba and Santa Fe; according to the 1822 census the total population of Córdoba was of 11,552 inhabitants.

===Contemporary history===

At the end of the 19th century the process of national industrialization began with the height of the economic agro-exporting model, principally of meats and cereals. This process is associated with the European immigration who began to settle the city, generally possessing the education and enterprising capacity appropriate for the development of industry. The majority of these European immigrants came from Italy (initially from Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy; later from Campania and Calabria), and Spain (mostly Galicians and Basques)

At the beginning of the 20th century the city had 90,000 inhabitants. The city&#x27;s physiognomy changed considerably following the construction of new avenues, walks and public squares, as well as the installation of an electrified tram system, in 1909. In 1918, Córdoba was the epicentre of a movement known as the University Reform, which then spread to the rest of the Universities of the country, Americas and Spain. 

The development of the domestic market, the British investments that facilitated European settlement, the development of the railways on the pampas rapidly industrialized the city. Córdoba&#x27;s industrial sector first developed from the need to transform raw materials such as leather, meats and wool for export.

In 1927, the Military Aircraft Manufacturer (FMA) was inaugurated. The facility would become one of the most important in the world after World War II with the arrival of German technical personnel. From 1952, its production began to diversify, to constitute the base of the former Institute Aerotécnico, the state-owned company Aeronautical and Mechanical Industries of the State (IAME). Córdoba was chosen as the site of The &quot;Instituto Aerotécnico&quot; that later became the &quot;Fábrica Militar de Aviones&quot;. It employed the Focke Wulf men until President Juan Perón was ousted by a coup in 1955. Lockheed Martin purchased FMA in 1995.

Córdoba, according to the census of 1947, had almost 400,000 inhabitants (a quarter of the province&#x27;s total). Subsequent industrial development led thousands of rural families to the city, doubling its population and turning Córdoba into the second largest city in Argentina, after Buenos Aires, by 1970. The city&#x27;s population and economic growth moderated, afterwards, though living standards rose with the increase in the national consumption of Córdoba&#x27;s industrial products, as well as the development of other sectors of economic activity. 

At times rivaling Buenos Aires for its importance in national politics, Córdoba was the site of the initial mutiny leading to the 1955 &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; that deposed President Juan Perón and the setting for the 1969 &quot;Cordobazo&quot;, a series of violent labor and student protests that ultimately led to elections in 1973. Córdoba&#x27;s current economic diversity is due to a vigorous services sector and the demand for agro-industrial and railway equipment and, in particular, the introduction of U.S. and European automakers after 1954.

== Geography ==

The city&#x27;s geographic location is , taking as a point of reference San Martín Square in downtown Córdoba. The relative location of the municipal common land, is in the south hemisphere of the globe, to the south of the South American subcontinent, in the geographical centre – west of Argentina and of the province of Córdoba; to a distance of from Buenos Aires, from the city of Rosario and (340 km (211 mi)) west of Santa Fe.

As per the provincial laws No. 778 14 December 1878, Not. 927 20 October 1883, and Not. 1295 29 December 1893, the limits of the city of Córdoba are delineated in the northern part, South, East and West located to from San Martín Square which means that the common land has from side. The city, adjoins in the northern territory with Colón Department summarizing a total surface of 562. 

===Geology===
The city is located in the plain of the Humid Pampa, to the east of the oriental cord of Córdoba Hills or Sierras Chicas, also known as the Sierras Cordobesas, which has an average height of 550 m. It spreads at the foot of the mount, on both banks of the River Suquía, and flows into the San Roque reservoir; from there, the Primero River goes east into the plains surrounding the city of Córdoba.

Once inside the city, the &quot;La Cañada&quot; stream meets the Rio Primero near the city centre area. Two kilometers to the east, &quot;Isla de los Patos&quot; (Ducks Island) was repopulated with ducks and swans in the 1980s. It was reported in March 2006 that a large number of ducks had died due to unspecified causes. Pollution caused by chemical waste is suspected as the cause, but avian influenza is also being investigated.

Beyond the city limits, the river flows towards the Algarrobos swamp and ends its course on the southern coast of the Mar Chiquita (or Mar de Ansenuza) salt lake. All in all, the river has a length of approximately and carries, on average, 9.7 m³/s, with minimum of 2 m³/s and maximum of 24 m³/s with a peak during the summer months.

Pollution of the water and of the riverbank is a major environmental issue in Córdoba. Periodic cleaning operations are carried out to increase the quality of the water and to preserve the viability of fishing, both in the San Roque reservoir area and downstream.

=== Climate ===
The climate of the city of Córdoba, and that of most of the province, is humid subtropical (&quot;Cwa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), moderated by the Pampas winds, cold winds that blow from the South-western quadrant, which originate in Antarctica.

There are four marked seasons. Summers run from late November till early March, and bring days between and and night between and with frequent thunderstorms. Heat waves are common, and bring days with temperatures over and hot, sticky nights; however, Pampero winds are sure to bring relief with thunderstorms and a day or two of cool, crisp weather: nighttime temperatures can easily descend to or less, but the heat starts building up right away the next day.

By late February or early March, nights start getting cooler and, in March, highs average and lows ; after cold fronts, lows below and highs below are recorded in this month.
April is significantly drier already; highs reach on average and lows , creating very pleasant conditions. In some years, temperatures can approach or even reach the freezing point in late April; however, heat waves of up to are still possible, but nights are rarely as hot as in the summer.
May usually brings the first frosts, and very dry weather, with under of rain expected. Highs average and lows average ; however, when cold waves reach the area, highs may stay below and lows can be well below freezing.

Winter lasts from late May till early September, and bring average highs of and lows of . However, strong northwesterly winds downsloping from the mountains can bring what is known as &quot;Veranito&quot; (little summer) with highs of up to or more and dusty, windy weather (but dry, pleasant nights) for 2–3 days. Conversely, when storms stall over the Atlantic coast, there may be several days of drizzle and cool weather, and when cold air masses invade the country from Antarctica (several times every winter), there may be one or two days with temperatures around , drizzle and high winds (which combined make it feel very cold), followed by dry, cold weather with nighttime lows between and and daytime highs between and . Snowfall is very rare in the city, but more frequent in the outskirts where the Sierras begin ; sleet may fall every once in a while. The record low temperature for Córdoba is . In June, only of rain are expected, compared to in January.

Spring is extremely variable and windy: there may be long stretches of cool, dry weather and cold nights followed by intense heat waves up to , followed by the most severe thunderstorms with hail and high winds. It is not unusual to see temperatures drop from one day to another, or to have frost following extreme heat. Drought is most common in this season, when the normal summer rainfall arrives later than expected.
By October, days are warm at but nights remain cold at , by late November, the weather resembles summer weather with cooler nights.

The wealthier suburbs west of the city are located at slightly higher altitudes, which allows cool breezes to blow in the summer, bringing drier, comfortable nights during hotter periods, and more regular frost in the winter. Generally speaking, Córdoba&#x27;s daytime temperatures are very slightly warmer than Buenos Aires&#x27; but nighttime lows are usually cooler, especially in the winter. This, combined with a lower humidity and the possibility of fleeing to higher altitudes minutes away from the city centre, makes the climate a bit more comfortable than in the capital.

The variations or thermal extents are greater than in Buenos Aires, and lower in annual rainfall: / year. The annual average temperature calculated during the 20th century was 18 °C. In January, the hottest month of the austral summer, the average maximum is 31 °C and the minimum 17 °C.
In July, the coldest month of the year, the average temperatures are between 19 °C and 3 °C.
In winter it is very frequent that temperatures rise above 30 °C, due to the influence of the wind Zonda.

Due to the extension of the metropolitan area, there exists a difference of 5 °C between the central area and the Greater Córdoba. The central district, a dense high-rise area is located in a depression, and it is the core of an important heat island. In addition the city presents a phenomenon of smog, but not so dense as to present health concerns.

== Demographics ==

=== Ethnicity ===
The largest ethnic groups in Córdoba are Italians/Italian Argentine and Spaniards/Spanish Argentine (mostly Galicians and Basques/Basque Argentine). Waves of immigrants from other European countries arrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From the rest of Western Europe came immigrants from Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). Other Europeans also arrived from nations such as Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, Armenia and the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked. Important Lebanese, Georgian, Syrian and Armenian communities have had a significant presence in commerce and civic life since the beginning of the 20th century.

Most immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Córdoba. However, in the early stages of immigration, some formed settlements (especially agricultural settlements) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations. 

=== Demographic distribution ===
Córdoba is the second largest city in the country in population and concentrates 40.9% of the Córdoba Province population of 3,216,993 inhabitants and represents almost 3.3% of the Argentine population, which is 43 million inhabitants. Driven by migration both domestic and from abroad, the city&#x27;s rate of population growth was an elevated 3.2% annually from 1914 to 1960; but, it has been declining steadily since then, and has averaged around 0.4% a year, since the national census of 2001.

According to the last provincial census of 2008, the city has 1,315,540 inhabitants, representing an increase of 3.78% with regard to the 1,267,521 registered during the national census of 2001.
Greater Córdoba is the metropolitan area of the city of Córdoba, a union of medium localities of the department Colón, from the north to the south. Greater Córdoba is the second-largest urban agglomeration in Argentina in both population and surface area.

The growth of the metropolitan area was not equal in all directions, it spreads approximately up to to the northwest of the Córdoba city centre in a thin succession of small localities. This is almost the maximum distance from the Buenos Aires city center to the most distant of its metropolitan area points; whereas in the rest of the cardinal points it comes to .

The city receives a constant flow of students from the northeastern and southwestern regions of Argentina and of other South American countries, owed principally to the National University of Córdoba, which increases gradually the city population. Córdoba grows constantly, expanding especially towards the southern areas of Alta Gracia and Villa Carlos Paz.

== Urban structure ==
The use of the city land is regulated by the municipality, which consists of approximately 26,177 hectares of urban area (40.24%), 12,267 hectares of industrially dominant area (21.3%), 16,404 hectares of rural area (28.45%) and 5,750 hectares for other uses such as military purposes or institutional spaces (9.98%) of the total area of the city.

Green spaces include different types of spaces, from small squares, up to urban, green linear parks of different scales as the river Suquia, bicycle pathways and highways. The surface area of green spaces supported by the Municipality of Córdoba adds up to approximately 1645 hectares. 

The historical centre is shaped by quadrangular blocks of some hundred thirty meters of side. The disposition of the neighborhoods and principal avenues is radial. From the city centre district large avenues lead out to the most peripheral neighborhoods. In conformity with demographic growth, the city has expanded principally to the northwest and to the southeast, following the trace of the National Route 9.
The governor, Juan Schiaretti, finalized the Circunvalaciónon on 6 July 2019, with completing the building of the last 2,8 km of the route from La Cañanada to Fuerza Aerea. This ended the construction of the 47 km long ring road motorway, which takes almost 34 minutes to complete.

===Districts===
Córdoba is home to one of the most important financial districts in South America. The district is home to the Bank of Córdoba and other private banking institutions. Sightseeing places include San Martín Square, the Jesuit Block (declared UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the Genaro Pérez Museum. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern, and the main thoroughfares are Vélez Sarsfield, Colón, General Paz, Dean Funes Avenue, and 27 April Street. The point of origin of the city is San Martin Square, surrounded by the Municipality and Central Post Office.

Downtown Córdoba is home to large shopping malls, notably Patio Olmos. This mall is the result of a massive regeneration effort, recycling and refurbishing the west side old warehouses into elegant offices and commercial centres. An important cultural point of interest is the Palacio Ferreyra, a mansion built in 1916 based on plans by the French architect, Ernest Sanson. The Ferreyra palace was converted into the Evita Perón Museum of Fine Arts (the city&#x27;s second) in 2007. Located at the corner of Hipólito Yrigoyen and Chacabuco Avenues, it has now been restored and adapted to house the city&#x27;s principal art gallery.

New Córdoba has a number of important avenues such as &quot;Yrigoyen&quot; and &quot;Vélez Sarsfield&quot;. Most of the university students in this growing city live in this neighbourhood, and a recent construction boom has been transforming this upscale area into the fastest-growing section in the city.
Ciudad Universitaria is a district located in the southern area of the city, next to the Sarmiento Park, the city&#x27;s most important one. The Universidad Nacional de Córdoba (UNC) has most of its facilities in this area. The UNC was the first university built in Argentina, founded by Jesuits around 1622. The Universidad Nacional de Córdoba is also famous for the &quot;Reforma Universitaria&quot;, a student-led protest that started in March 1918 in the Medical School, in which the students rebelled against the prevailing university system. This was an old anachronistic system in which professors were authoritarian and inefficient, with a religiously-oriented curriculum. Eventually this revolt led to a more secular curriculum and some significant re-structuring of the university government. The distinctive nature of the movement derived not only from its radical demands, but also from its extremist tactics, the level of sophistication of its organization, and its major continental impact. In fact, the Reform Movement rapidly spread from Córdoba to Lima (1919), Cuzco (1920), Santiago de Chile (1920), and Mexico (1921). Another important university, the UTN, dedicated to the teaching of engineering sciences, is located in this part of the city. There is also a gym and football stadium and tennis courts for the students. The &quot;Córdoba Zoo&quot; is located in this district.

Located about from downtown Córdoba is the Cerro de Las Rosas. This very affluent neighborhood is famous for its schools, shops and educational institutions. This neighborhood&#x27;s economic activity centers around Rafael Núñez Avenue, a long wide road that stretches for a few kilometers and has restaurants, boutiques, banks and other shops. Over the last decade, this neighborhood has experienced steady growth; however, some of its most affluent inhabitants have moved to gated communities for security reasons. Some of these communities, such as &quot;Las Delicias&quot; and &quot;Lomas de los Carolinos&quot;, are in the old Camino a La Calera.

== Transportation ==
The Córdoba public transport system includes trains, buses, trolleybuses and taxis. Long-distance buses reach most cities and towns throughout the country.

The city is served by the nation&#x27;s third-largest airport, Ingeniero Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport.

=== Buses ===
Buses are, by far, the most popular way of transportation around Córdoba Province. There are many different companies that provide long distance, short distance and urban services. They all have their own prices, that are not cheap compared to the rest of Argentina. Córdoba is one of the Provinces with higher transportation rates. Urban buses used to be paid with a card called RedBus

===Railway===


Rail transport in Córdoba has commuter and long-distance services, all operated by the state-owned Trenes Argentinos. From the Mitre railway station trains depart for Villa María while the Tren de las Sierras connects the district of Alta Córdoba with Cosquín.

From Retiro station in Buenos Aires, trains reach Córdoba twice a week with an estimated journey time of 18 hours. Many people choose the train because of the low cost, but it takes almost twice the time that would take to do the same trip by bus (around eight hours).

The Tren de las Sierras is a tourist service that crosses part of the Valle de Punilla, Quebrada del Río Suquía and borders the Dique San Roque&#x27;s Lake. It has two services per day with an additional service on weekends. It takes between 2 and 3 hours to go from Alta Córdoba Station to Cosquín.

Córdoba has two railway stations, the Córdoba (Mitre) originally built by the Central Argentine R. in 1886. That station has been an intermediate stop for trains to Tucumán, successively operated by Ferrocarriles Argentinos and then by private consortiums such as Ferrocentral. The other station is Alta Córdoba, built and operated by British-owned Córdoba North Western in 1891, and currently the terminus of Tren de las Sierras.

Railway stations in the city of Córdoba are:

===High-speed rail project===

The Argentine government had planned to build a high-speed train between Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba. It would eventually join Córdoba and Buenos Aires, with an intermediate stop in Rosario, in about 3 hours at speeds of up to . Originally scheduled to be started in 2008, with its inauguration in 2010, the project was finally cancelled in December 2012. The total cost of the rail had been estimated at US$4,000,000,000.

==Economy==

Since World War II, Córdoba has been developing a versatile industrial base. The biggest sectors is car and car parts manufacturing: Renault has a factory which produces a range of cars and Volkswagen has a factory specialized in the production of gearboxes. The capital goods company CNH Industrial has also a factory in the city. The legal service Novadios was founded in 2008 in this city. Many suppliers (both local and foreign) manufacture car parts for these operations. Additionally, in 2017–2018, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz began the production of their new pickup truck at the local Renault factory. Railway construction (Materfer) and aircraft construction (Fábrica Militar de Aviones) were once significant employers, but their activities have greatly diminished. Furthermore, there are some textile, heavy and chemical industries (e.g. Porta for alcohol).

Areas around Córdoba produce vast amounts of agricultural products, and some of these are processed around the city. Additionally, the province is one of the main producers of agricultural machinery in the country, although most of these operations are not in the city itself. Candy company Arcor is headquartered in the city.

Córdoba has been considered the technological centre of Argentina. The Argentine &quot;spaceport&quot; (Centro Espacial Teófilo Tabanera), where satellites are being developed and operated for CONAE, is located in the suburb of Falda del Carmen. The software and electronic industries are advancing and becoming significant exporters; among the leading local employers in the sector are Motorola, Vates, Intel, Electronic Data Systems, and Santex América.

The city also has a service-based economy focused on retail, professional services and financial services, where the main local player is credit card provider Tarjeta Naranja. It has recently emerged as a start-up hub with a growing number of angel investors, in part due to the availability of people with technology-oriented skills.

==Sports==
Association football is the most popular sport in Córdoba as well as in Argentina. Several leagues and divisions compete in the local championship annually. The city currently has three representatives in the Argentine First Division, Talleres, Belgrano, and Instituto, and also one in the second, Racing de Córdoba. Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes hosted 8 matches in the 1978 FIFA World Cup.

Basketball is the second-most popular sport in Córdoba. Asociación Deportiva Atenas is the most popular club, and one of the most successful in Argentina, having won the National League (LNB) seven times, and being three times winner of the South American League. Córdoba was one of the host cities of the official Basketball World Cup for its 1967 and 1990 editions.

Cordoba was also a host for the 2002 FIVB Men&#x27;s Volleyball World Championship and organized the UCI BMX World Championships in 2000.

Rugby union is also a very popular sport in Córdoba, which has close to 20 teams with many divisions. Tala Rugby Club, Club La Tablada, Córdoba Athletic Club (one of the oldest clubs in Argentina and founded by the British who worked in the building of the Argentine Railroads around 1882), Jockey Club Córdoba, and Club Universitario de Córdoba are some of the most prestigious teams. Córdoba is one of the strongest rugby places in Argentina, and is the home of many international players. Many of the great players in Argentina and Italy began their careers in the Córdoba&#x27;s rugby clubs.

In tennis, since 2019, the Córdoba Open is also held at the &quot;Polo Deportivo Kempes&quot;, a sports complex next to Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes.
Golf and tennis are also very popular; notable players who started playing in Córdoba include Ángel &quot;Pato&quot; Cabrera and Eduardo &quot;Gato&quot; Romero (b. 1954) in golf and David Nalbandian in tennis.

The Argentine stage of the World Rally Championship has been run near Córdoba since 1984.
Motorsport events also take place at Autódromo Oscar Cabalén, such as TC2000 but has hosted Stock Car Brasil and Formula Truck.

== Education ==
Córdoba has long been one of Argentina&#x27;s main educational centers, with 6 universities and several postsecondary colleges. Students from the entire country, as well as neighbouring countries attend the local universities, giving the city a distinct atmosphere.

The National University of Córdoba, established since 1613, is the 4th oldest in the Americas and the first in Argentina. It has about 105,000 students, and offers degrees in a wide variety of subjects in the sciences, applied sciences, social sciences, humanities and arts.

==Culture==
===Literature===
Literary activity flourished in the city at the beginning of the last century. Córdoba was the city of Leopoldo Lugones, Arturo Capdevila and Marcos Aguinis, among many other prestigious writers. Among the city&#x27;s best-known museums are the Caraffa Fine Arts Museum, founded in 1916, and the Evita Fine Arts Museum, founded in 2007. The Paseo del Buen Pastor, a cultural center opened in 2007, features an art museum, as well as a shopping gallery devoted to local vintners, cheese makers, leather crafters and other artisans.

===Music===
The typical music in Córdoba is the cuarteto, heard in many parties and pubs. Among the most popular cuarteto singers are Carlos &quot;la Mona&quot; Jiménez (b. 1951), Rodrigo, La Barra and Jean Carlos. The places they usually sing are named &quot;bailes&quot; (lit. dances). One of the first groups was &quot;Cuarteto de Oro&quot;.

Other music styles popular with the youth are electronic music (or &quot;electro&quot;), as well as reggaeton. These are commonly played at &quot;boliches&quot;, as night clubs are known in Argentina. Córdoba is sometimes referred to as &quot;the nightlife city&quot; (or &quot;the city that never sleeps&quot;), because of its wide range of clubs and teenage &quot;matinées&quot; (dancing clubs).

Córdoba&#x27;s rich musical culture also encompasses classical, jazz, rock and pop, in a variety of venues.

Teatro Libertador San Martín regularly features concerts, operas, folk music, and plays.

===Monuments===
Córdoba has many historical monuments left over from the colonial era. In the centre, near the &quot;Plaza San Martín&quot; square, is the Jesuit Cathedral, whose altar is made of stone and silver from Potosí. Every ornament inside is made of gold and the roof is all painted with different images from the Bible. Another important historic building is the &quot;Cabildo&quot; (colonial government house), located next to the church. The Jesuit Block, the Monserrat School, the University and the church of the Society of Jesus are also located in Córdoba.

In Nueva Córdoba, it is situated &quot;Iglesia del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús&quot;, also known as &quot;Los Cappuchinos&quot;. This is an example of Neo Gothic style.

===Festivals===
The first festival of the year is in February, the Carnival, where children enjoy throwing water balloons at each other on the street.

Then in the middle of the year, on 20 July, Friends Day is celebrated. Usually, most of the teenagers meet at Parque de las Naciones or Parque Sarmiento and spend the afternoon there. At night, they go dancing to different places, and enjoy a drink.

The last festival is Spring Day, held on 21 September, which is Students&#x27; Day. Many go to the park or spend the day in the nearby city of Villa Carlos Paz. There they can enjoy concerts, dancing, going downtown or visiting the river bank.

<doc id="241270" wikidata="Q133317" url="?curid=241270" title="Hexanchiformes">
<text>The Hexanchiformes are a primitive order of sharks, numbering just seven extant species in two families. Fossil sharks that were apparently very similar to modern sevengill species are known from Jurassic specimens.

== Taxonomy ==
Due to their primitive anatomy, hexanchiforms were previously considered the most basal group of sharks. However, more recent phylogenetic studies indicate that while primitive, they in fact belong to the superorder Squalomorphii, which also contains dogfishes, angelsharks, and sawsharks, although they are thought to be the most basal member of the group.

== Description ==
Hexanchiform sharks have one spineless dorsal fin located over or behind the pelvic fins and one anal fin. The vertebral column extends into the long dorsal lobe of the caudal fin, while the ventral lobe is either small or absent. They have either six or seven gill slits, located in front of the pectoral fins. They have a large mouth, with eyes on either side of the head. The spiracles are small and located well above and behind the eyes. The eyes have no nictitating membrane. 

The frilled sharks of the genus &quot;Chlamydoselachus&quot; are very different from the cow sharks, and have been proposed to be moved to a distinct order, Chlamydoselachiformes. However, genetic studies have found them to be each others&#x27; closest relatives, and they share certain derived features supporting them both being in the same order.

Shark teeth similar to modern hexanchids and echinorhinids are known from Devonian deposits in Antarctica and Australia, as well as Permian deposits in Japan. If these are in fact hexanchids, this may be the only extant order of elasmobranchs to have survived the Permian extinction (and by extension, the oldest extant order of elasmobranchs). However, the Australian/Antarctic shark teeth, from the family Mcmurdodontidae, have also been found to lack a multilayer enameloid layer covering the tooth crown, something found in all modern sharks and most Devonian sharks, indicating that they are neoselachians of uncertain affinity or even indeterminate chondrichthyans. The occurrence of derived sharks in the Devonian is also irreconcilable with the results of all phylogenetic estimates in the group.

It is debated whether the extinct families Orthacodontidae and Paraorthacodontidae belong to the Hexanchiformes or the extinct Synechodontiformes. However, the Shark-References database currently lists them as members of the Hexanchiformes.

== Distribution ==
Species are widespread and found across most of the world. They are most common in cold deep water in the tropics, but are also found closer to the shore in more temperate regions.

In 1995, 60 participants at an international health conference agreed to form a permanent body to promote the dissemination of accurate health information through technology. Health On the Net was founded under the auspices of the Geneva Department of Employment, Social Affairs and Health. It holds consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and a special relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO). The French National Health Authority appointed Health On the Net in 2007 as its official body to certify health websites based in France.

As a &quot;Liaison A&quot; to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Health Informatics Technical Committee (ISO/TC 215), Health On the Net contributes to the elaboration of standards developed by the committee.

Health On the Net offered an array of tools and services, including the HON Code of Conduct and its certification process; the Khresmoi and HONselect search engines; Provisu.ch, a database of health information on eye diseases, accessible by those with poor or no vision; and Santeromande.ch, a database directed towards French speakers in Switzerland and France, providing health information and a directory of registered health professionals and organisations.

== Certification ==

HON Foundation issued a code of conduct (HONcode) for medical and health websites to address reliability and usefulness of medical information on the Internet. The principles of the HONcode are:
# Authority – information and advice given only by medical professionals with credentials of author/s, or a clear statement if this is not the case
# Complementarity – information and help are to support, not replace, patient-healthcare professional relationships which is the desired means of contact
# Confidentiality – how the site treats personal and non-personal information of readers
# Attribution – references to source of information (URL if available) and when it was last updated
# Justifiability – any treatment, product or service must be supported by balanced, well-referenced scientific information
# Transparency of authorship – contact information, preferably including email addresses, of authors should be available
# Transparency of sponsorship – sources of funding for the site
# Honesty in advertising and editorial policy – details about advertising on the site and clear distinction between advertised and editorial material

Each principle also had a Web 2.0 component in order to address the evolution of the Web in terms of information provision, including social media use.

HONCode is not designed to rate the veracity of the information provided by a website. Rather, the code only states that the site holds to the standards, so that readers can know the source and purpose of the medical information presented. The HONcode is voluntary, which means that webmasters and information providers apply for HONcode certification. Following this, the website is reviewed by a specialized team of health and legal professionals. The HONcode certification is dynamic and is renewed yearly according to site compliance. The first year of certification is free of charge. However, the new recertification process, started in 2014 when the foundation&#x27;s government sponsors required the foundation to develop its financial independence, requires a financial contribution from the sites requesting recertification. The fees are as follows: €50 for non-profits with little visibility, €160 for sites with high visibility, and €325 for commercial websites. Visibility is determined by the website&#x27;s Alexa ranking.

In 2020, there were currently more than 8,000 HONcode certified websites, including WebMD, Everyday Health, Drugs.com, and Healthline. The HONcode has been translated into 35 languages. It is the oldest and the most used code for medical and health-related information on the internet.

Research in 2015 showed that the HONcode is an indicator of reliability of health information. Additional studies demonstrate that websites using the HONcode quality standards are more reliable than those that do not. Additionally, the HONcode has been identified as an indicator of accuracy. Certified health pages have a statistically representative higher quality score than health websites that were not certified, with one going so far as to say that &quot;the results of their analysis have shown a quality score that is statistically superior for HON-certified sites proving that even if it is imperfect, this label remains a coherent and trustworthy tool.” (Translated from the French: “Les résultats de notre analyse ont montré un score de qualité statistiquement supérieur pour les sites certifiés HON prouvant que, même si imparfait, ce label reste un outil cohérent et fiable.&quot;)

== Limits and criticism ==

The HONcode only applied to a website&#x27;s editorial processes and details, not to the actual published contents. The term &quot;certification&quot; can be misleading to the general public, as it can imply that the contents of the website are trustworthy, reliable or otherwise independent. However, because the certification process is based on both self-declaration of adherence to the principles and assessment by a HONcode expert verifying that this is the case, it is not possible for a site to be initially certified if it does not meet the HONcode principles.

However, it was possible for a certified site to change its content such that it no longer meets the certification criteria. While website owners are required to inform HON of any fundamental changes to their website during periods between certification and recertification, this is not always the case. Thus a site may be listed as certified when it no longer is. This is addressed at latest during the recertification process, or earlier if HON is notified that the site no longer meets certification standards. The HONcode is considered a useful guide and for some it provides the best overall guidance compared to other tools, but in the end the reliability of the information is also dependent on the information provider.

The HONcode principles themselves are subject to criticism, with some experts indicating they are not adapted to modern Internet usages and do not follow their own rules. In response to those limitations, one previously certified website has decided to no longer display the Health On the Net logo.

Yet greater awareness of the HONcode and its certification process was needed, with the authors of one study highlighting the need “to broadcast the relevance of HON certification so that creditable medical health information could be published online”.

== HONcode misuse ==

In 2000, a journal article raised a number of problems with the HONcode logo, indicating that consumers may mistake it as an award or interpret it as an indicator for assessed information. Other issues with the HONcode logo were discussed in the &quot;Journal of Medical Internet Research&quot;, a peer-reviewed eHealth journal. Websites that are not in compliance with HONcode can continue to display the seal, as Health On the Net Foundation (HON) has no means of forcing the offending webmaster to remove the certification seal. However, as the certification seal is active and dynamic, leading to a page on HON servers with the date of the certification&#x27;s validity and the status of certification in real time, the link from websites will lead to the page showing that the site is no longer in compliance (i.e., that it is either being reassessed or the certification has been revoked). This is indicated in real time. It is, however, possible for the site to retain the logo without the click through. Thus, users should be aware that if the seal is not clickable, the site is no longer in compliance and is misusing the logo.

Consumer protection advocate Stephen Barrett has been a strong supporter of the HONcode and has made efforts to improve compliance with its rules and to expose those who misuse it. A 2004 special supplement to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; provides coverage of his views on the subject, including suggested improvements and his criticisms of many named misusers.

The HONcode relies on noncompliance being reported by consumers. In cases of suspected fraudulent websites or of misuse of the HONcode, HON advises internet users to alert Quackwatch or HON itself through the complaint mechanism on the HON website: &quot;If you come across a healthcare Web site that you believe is either possibly or blatantly fraudulent and does NOT display the HONcode, please alert Quackwatch. Of course, if such a site DOES display the HONcode, alert us immediately.&quot;

Other problems with the application of the HONcode principles are that HON does not have a means of verifying many of the principles, such as credentials (medical or otherwise) as stated on websites displaying the logo, or that copyright or confidentiality is not violated by webmasters.
