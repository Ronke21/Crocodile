<doc id="240687" wikidata="Q6596428" url="?curid=240687" title="List of Saturday Night Live commercial parodies">
<text>On the American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;), a commercial advertisement parody is commonly shown after the host&#x27;s opening monologue. Many of the parodies were produced by James Signorelli. The industries, products, and ad formats targeted by the parodies have been wide-ranging, including fast food, beer, feminine hygiene products, toys, clothes, medications (both prescription and over-the-counter), financial institutions, automobiles, electronics, appliances, public-service announcements, infomercials, and movie &amp; TV shows (including &quot;SNL&quot; itself).

Many of &quot;SNL&quot;″s ad parodies have been featured in prime-time clip shows over the years, including an April 1991 special hosted by Kevin Nealon and Victoria Jackson, as well as an early 1999 follow-up hosted by Will Ferrell that features his attempts to audition for a feminine hygiene commercial. In late 2005 and in March 2009, the special was modernized, featuring commercials created since the airing of the original special.

* &quot;16 and Pregnant&quot; Spinoffs — A November 2010 ad finds MTV cashing in with spinoffs inspired by &quot;16 and Pregnant&quot; and &quot;Teen Mom&quot; (complete with an altered logo to &quot;MTV: Maternity Television&quot;). The parody promotes &quot;My Super Sweet 16 and Pregnant&quot;; &quot;America&#x27;s Best Pregnant Dance Crew&quot;; &quot;Wild &#x27;n Out with a Special Guest: A Baby&quot;; an all-baby-cribs edition of &quot;Cribs&quot;; and &quot;I&#x27;m Snooki and Pregnant&quot; (Snooki would reveal her pregnancy and engagement in March 2012).
* 1-800-Flowers — Kristen Wiig promotes the floral retailer as a way to show love for her mother (Kate McKinnon) &quot;even when Mom is at her most annoying&quot;.
* 5-hour Empathy — &quot;For when you just don&#x27;t get it,&quot; the manufacturers of 5-hour Energy invent a liquid supplement that provides, according to Kenan Thompson&#x27;s voiceover, &quot;5 full hours of complete, intimate understanding of years of systemic oppression and ever-present racism.&quot; Although having an initial desire to do so, ad subject Beck Bennett is hesitant to try it, pantomiming chugging it down (&quot;The cap is still on,&quot; notes Thompson); insisting that he is not racist (&quot;I voted for Biden; what more do you want?!&quot;); and offering it to wife Heidi Gardner, who also declines (&quot;I don&#x27;t need that, &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a woman, so… it&#x27;s the same&quot;).
* 24-Hour Energy for Dating Actresses — This parody postulates that having an actress for a girlfriend, and dealing with their quirks, can leave a man exhausted and debilitated. However, this once-daily supplement gives men the energy they need to handle their paramours&#x27; constant rehearsing, mastering of foreign accents, emotional swings over callbacks, etc. Also promoted is a female formula, &quot;24-Hour Energy for Dating Comedians.&quot;
* &quot;2020 Part 2: 2024&quot; — Democratic-leaning voters are terrified over Joe Biden possibly running for re-election as U.S. President in 2024, and who would run for the party&#x27;s nomination if he declined, in this October 2022 horror movie trailer &quot;from the producers of &quot;Smile&quot; and the twisted minds of &quot;Morning Joe&quot;.”

== A ==
* ABBA Christmas — This infomercial spoof promotes a never-released album of holiday songs from &quot;The Fleetwood Mac of cold weather&quot; (Bowen Yang, episode host Kate McKinnon, and McKinnon&#x27;s fellow &quot;SNL&quot; alums Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig), all set to the tunes of their well-known classics (e.g. &quot;Gifts for Me, Gifts for You&quot;).
* Abilify for Candidates — &quot;Because not everyone can be President,&quot; this version of the atypical antipsychotic is specially formulated for candidates in the 2016 presidential election, among them Rick Santorum (Taran Killam) and Mike Huckabee (Bobby Moynihan).
* Academy of Better Careers — Spokesman Wendell Craig pitches a program for people to find jobs as stand-by operators.
* Action Cats — A parody of action-figure toys featuring plastic armor and weapons for live cats.
* Adobe – A car that&#x27;s cheap (sticker price: $179) but also unsafe (it&#x27;s made entirely of clay) yet &quot;combines German engineering and Mexican know-how!&quot;
* Adopt Belushi for Christmas — On the last episode before Christmas 1976, episode host Candice Bergen encourages families to write in and invite John Belushi into their home for the holidays (since, unlike the rest of the cast and crew, he has no place else to go).
* Aerotoilet — An Aerobed-like inflatable toilet that can be used anywhere and is perfect for guests at large parties. A cut-for-time ad from Season 47.
* Airbnb — Natalie (Chloe Fineman) enjoys offering her home to guests through the lodging service… although she laments sharing it with European guest Oolie (also Fineman), whose one-night stay has been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine, resulting in Natalie being subjected to Oolie&#x27;s discourteous manners (e.g. washing dishes with a garden hose, doing yoga topless in the front yard).
* Alaska Airlines — After a door plug on one of its Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes broke and caused decompression post-takeoff, the airline states that they&#x27;re taking precautions (e.g. tightening bolts, bringing Sully Sullenberger out of retirement) and reassuring passengers that they&#x27;ll have a great story to tell after the plane lands (complete with a $50 commemorative photo).
* The Al Pacino Accused Murderer Biopic Series — Fresh off playing Phil Spector in a biopic for the network, and three years after he played Dr. Jack Kevorkian in another film, HBO calls again on Al Pacino (Bill Hader) to play several other famous figures accused of murder, including Ted Kaczynski, Amanda Knox, the Menendez brothers, the captain of the &quot;Costa Concordia&quot;, Oscar Pistorius, and Conrad Murray (Michael Jackson&#x27;s personal physician).
* Al Sharpton&#x27;s Casa De Sushi — Sharpton (as himself) opens a Japanese restaurant in Secaucus… even though Sharpton hates the food and only runs the restaurant because, &quot;Well, presidential campaigns don&#x27;t finance themselves, people.&quot;
* Almost Pizza — It may look and smell like pizza, but it&#x27;s not quite pizza, as proven by its molecular instability (it gets hotter when removed from the oven, shatters like glass, then regroups and crawls on the floor).
* AM Ale — An alcoholic beverage for the morning because &quot;you can&#x27;t wait &#x27;til afternoon&quot;.
* Amazin&#x27; Lazer — A consumer grade laser gun used for cleaning up yard waste or (as onscreen superimpositions discourage) dangerous and potentially criminal acts.
* The Amazing Alexander – This 1986 ad promotes a Broadway theatre performance by a popular stage hypnotist (portrayed in performance still shots by Jon Lovitz). Audience members interviewed in the ad give the show unanimous praise—the same praise, in fact, delivered in a hypnotic trance (&quot;I loved it. It was much better than &quot;CATS&quot;. I&#x27;m going to see it again and again.&quot;).
* Amazon — Husbands and kids can buy typical Mother&#x27;s Day gifts (e.g. bed and bath items, a new washing machine) on the website… but moms use it to buy vibrating massagers (which one daughter mistakes for a microphone) or the best-selling novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; (in hard-copy or, so the husband doesn&#x27;t have to know she&#x27;s reading it, on Kindle).
* Amazon Echo Silver — Designed in partnership with AARP, this smart speaker device for elderly users speaks very loudly, responds to anything remotely resembling &quot;Alexa,&quot; and mutters &quot;Uh-huh&quot; during long, rambling stories.
* Amazon Go — &quot;No lines. No Checkout. (No, seriously.)&quot; That&#x27;s the tagline for the convenience store chain where, with just a scan of their Amazon app, customers can grab what they want and leave… though, despite the reassurance, Black customers are clearly skittish to do so (e.g. Punkie Johnson insists on paying, episode host Zoë Kravitz asks white boyfriend Andrew Dismukes grab a bottle of kombucha for her).
* AMC Theatres — The movie theater chain&#x27;s celebration of the moviegoing experience has been parodied in two ads:
** An ad that closed out Season 46 spoofs AMC&#x27;s teaming with Vin Diesel to promote his upcoming &quot;F9&quot;; this parody finds Diesel (Beck Bennett) celebrating the little minutiae (&quot;The tickets… the sticky floors… that hand-dryer in the bathroom that&#x27;s louder than a choo-choo train&quot;) that makes going to &quot;the &quot;mooo&quot;-vies&quot; so great.
** Season 48&#x27;s premiere parodied Nicole Kidman&#x27;s AMC Theaters ad. This parody begins as a nearly shot-for-shot remake of Kidman&#x27;s original ad until Kidman (Chloe Fineman) becomes a mystical, almost demonic entity as the patrons seated around her stand, cult-like, to salute the power of the theater (&quot;Heartbreak feels good in a place like this!&quot;).
* American Cancer Society – This PSA from Season 6 has spokeswoman Gail Matthius promising to honestly and openly discuss breast cancer and perform a self-exam, a promise broken when she discusses the exam in euphemisms and her chest is covered by a censor bar.
* American Dope Growers Union – Laraine Newman and a chorus of marijuana growers who &quot;support ourselves by growing marijuana in American soil&quot; encourage people to &quot;look for the union label&quot; wherever they buy dope (&quot;It says we deal for the U.S. of A.&quot;). A 1977 parody of the ILGWU&#x27;s famous ad jingle.
* American Express — This 2015 parody of the credit card&#x27;s celebrity-driven ad campaign features episode host Chris Hemsworth recalling how people said he was too tall, too blonde, and too muscular to make it in show business. But, he concludes, &quot;if a jacked Australian with a perfect face can make it, anyone can.&quot;
* &quot;American Girls&quot; — This Season 48 film trailer gives the American Girl dolls adventures that are as cheery as those the Barbie line experience in their own upcoming motion picture, but are still rooted in historically-accurate backstories (e.g. one doll comes from the Victorian Era, another is a runaway slave).
* American Taser – A series of people demonstrate the latest models of tasers by shocking each other. It begins with a pitchman (Chris Parnell), followed by a police officer (Jason Sudeikis), a second pitchman (Darrell Hammond), a sexual predator (Seth Meyers), a feminist businesswoman (Amy Poehler), an angry wife (Rachel Dratch), the angry wife&#x27;s husband (Will Forte), a black man (Kenan Thompson), a racist nightwatchman (Bill Hader), a militant black man (Finesse Mitchell), a &quot;Star Trek&quot; geek (Andy Samberg), and ends with the manufacturer&#x27;s president (episode host Jason Lee) who shocks himself.
* America&#x27;s Turning Gay – A parody of uplifting ad campaigns for 7 Up (&quot;America&#x27;s Turning 7-Up&quot;) and Dr. Pepper (&quot;Be a Pepper&quot;) where small-town residents celebrate their sudden realization of their homosexuality.
* America&#x27;s Worst Moments – Spokesman Chris Parnell pitches a commemorative plate collection featuring America&#x27;s most shocking and embarrassing moments in politics and pop culture.
* Amy Fisher — One month after Fisher was sentenced to prison for shooting the wife of her paramour, Joey Buttafuoco, and just days after ABC, CBS, and NBC (in a 6-day span) offered their own TV movie dramatizations on Fisher&#x27;s life and crime, &quot;SNL&quot; made the saga of &quot;the Long Island Lolita&quot; a recurring theme in its first episode of 1993, including the following ad parodies:
** &quot;Aaron Spelling&#x27;s Amy Fisher 10516&quot; — Fox goes the &quot;90210&quot; route and casts Tori Spelling (Melanie Hutsell) in the role of Amy opposite episode host Danny DeVito as Joey
** &quot;Amy Fisher: One Messed-Up Bitch&quot; — A gritty all-Black telling of the tale, airing on BET and starring Jackée Harry (Ellen Cleghorne) in the role of Amy
** &quot;Unbelievable New Breakthroughs: The Amy Fisher Story&quot; — An infomercial spoof that sees Amy&#x27;s victim, Mary Jo Buttafuoco (returning &quot;SNL&quot; alum Jan Hooks), offer her side of the story while receiving hair replacement treatment from Ron Popiel (DeVito)
* …and More — Tina-Tina Chenuse (Jenny Slate) promotes her stores that stock personalized novelties. The skits share 3 elements: Tina-Tina introducing herself, &quot;Hi-lo, I&#x27;m Tina-Tina Chenuse&quot;; the store names ending with &quot;and More&quot; (e.g. &quot;Car Horns and More&quot;); and Tina-Tina exclaiming &quot;Oh, my God&quot; somewhere in the sketch.
* And So This Is Hanukkah – A promo for a celebrity-packed Hanukkah special featuring entertainers who know very little about the holiday.
* Angora Bouquet — A sedative-laced facial cleanser that &quot;washes your brain as well as your face&quot;.
* Angry Dog — Dog food with &quot;synthetic testosterone and seven psychoactive drugs&quot; (and a picture of Michael Vick on the package) that turns any dog ferocious.
* Annuale — Medicine that keeps women on a constant stream of hormones, allowing them only one period per year. When each period happens, the user can become violent (Tina Fey wields an ax in the office), aggressive (Amy Poehler kicks her husband in the groin), hungry (Casey Wilson shovels an entire birthday cake down her mouth at a child&#x27;s party), and sexually frustrated (Kristen Wiig French kisses her dog). 
* &quot;The Apocalypse&quot; — &quot;The people who brought you &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot;&quot; apply the same themes of those films (romantic comedy, holiday setting, all-star ensemble cast) to the world&#x27;s end. This trailer&#x27;s tagline: &quot;It&#x27;s love… at last sight.&quot;
* Aron&#x27;s List — an online service that&#x27;s similar to Angie&#x27;s List but charges a lower fee, thanks to its roster of plumbers, carpenters, etc. who are on the &quot;American Registry of Non-Violent Sex-Offenders&quot; (what the site&#x27;s &quot;Aron&quot; acronym stands for).
* Asian American Doll — A Barbie parody promotes &quot;the doll that&#x27;s Asian American&quot; and, as noted in Cecily Strong&#x27;s voiceover, has been designed to be as bland as possible so that it&#x27;s as inoffensive as possible (&quot;As the box says, &#x27;Just take her or leave her&#x27;&quot;). This includes not assigning her a name up front (kids get to do that); a play house that&#x27;s barren; and accessories including a dog and a chef&#x27;s hat… until one girl realizes that those are plays on the stereotype of dog meat consumption in South Korea.
* Ass Angel Perfume Jeans — Women can both look &quot;and&quot; smell great in these jeans that mask &quot;secret little lady scents&quot; with aromas of lavender, rose, and industrial chemicals (&quot;do not wear these jeans if you have kidney or liver problems… consult your doctor before purchasing&quot;). Set in a 1980s music video style, this Season 46 ad features episode host Adele, returning &quot;SNL&quot; alum Maya Rudolph, and feather-haired rocker Beck Bennett (♪♫&quot;She&#x27;s got the ass of an angel/I wanna smell it some more&quot;♪♫).
* Ass Don&#x27;t Smell — Personal hygiene spray intended to keep one&#x27;s buttocks smelling fresh and clean; a parody of feminine hygiene deodorant sprays.
* Autoscent — Just as air fresheners deodorize the home, this product does the same for an automobile&#x27;s internal combustion system; just spray it into the carburetor every 800 miles, and your car&#x27;s exhaust will smell like lilacs or pine forests.
* Autumn Fizz — &quot;The Carbonated Douche&quot; that &quot;brings out the natural fragrance of femininity, with the effervescence of uncola.&quot;
* Autumn&#x27;s Eve Pumpkin Spice Douche — from the makers of Summer&#x27;s Eve comes a feminine hygiene product that has the bold, spicy scent of fall.
* &quot;Aw Nuts! Mom&#x27;s a Ghost!&quot; — A promo for a new Disney Channel show centered on a family with a peculiar mother (episode host Kristen Wiig): After taking a lover on a business trip to South Korea, only to have him drown her to keep their affair a secret, she returns as a &quot;Korean water ghost&quot; to raise her two kids and terrorize the neighborhood, K-horror style.

== B ==
* &quot;Baba Wawa Talks to Herself&quot; — Rather than talk with celebrities or world leaders, Baba Wawa (Gilda Radner) spends her next TV special interviewing &quot;one tewwific pewson who I weawwy wespect — me!&quot;
* Baby Spanx — Ashamed of having a chubby baby? This elasticized shapewear can smooth out any infant&#x27;s unsightly fat. As spokesman Jason Sudeikis states, &quot;I would never spank a baby, but I sure as hell would SPANX one!&quot;
* Bad Idea Jeans — a commercial featuring scenes of people discussing what can be considered &quot;bad ideas&quot; (for example, &quot;Thought about it and even though it&#x27;s over, I&#x27;m gonna tell my wife about the affair.&quot;). After each scene, white text on a black background reads &quot;BAD IDEA&quot;. Each scene also zooms in on each person wearing said jeans.
* &quot;Bad Seed&quot; — a venomous, near-hysterical Nancy Reagan (Terry Sweeney) debunks rumors that her daughter Patti&#x27;s novel, &quot;Home Front&quot;, is based on real-life, and pitches her own book that she co-wrote with Stephen King.
* Balz-Off — a medication that makes men more sensitive to women by killing off their testosterone levels.
* Banshee — NBC staff announcer Ed Herlihy pitches this collection of audio speakers that serve in your place when you can&#x27;t (or don&#x27;t want to) attend a funeral. The closing tag line: &quot;First in Last Respects.&quot;
* Barkley&#x27;s Bank — Former NBA player Charles Barkley has opened a bank in which he takes people&#x27;s money and gambles with it in the hopes of either doubling their money or losing it all.
* Bartenson&#x27;s Grocery Store — Kathy and Suzanna-Anne-Helen (Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant) promote the items shoppers fearing the COVID-19 pandemic bypass in favor of traditional staple foods, including &quot;fluoride bananas,&quot; &quot;Mint Pringles,&quot; and a &quot;Make Your Own BBQ Kit&quot; (a 400-pound hog, sauce, and a knife). For those shopping online, the store&#x27;s website also offers replacement suggestions such as salsa for pasta sauce and a DVD of &quot;Van Helsing&quot; for toilet paper. An ad airing as part of &quot;SNL&quot;″s second-ever &quot;at home&quot; episode in April 2020.
* Bathroom Businessman — This advert starts off as a promo for a fully functional portable office (computer monitors and all) that businessman Kenan Thompson can set up in a public toilet, giving a dual meaning to &quot;doing business.&quot; It takes a turn, however, when Thompson finds he can&#x27;t &quot;do business&quot; because the desk setup has blocked his path to the toilet… and the ad becomes &quot;a public service announcement for Decency,&quot; warning viewers to stop checking work texts and e-mails on the toilet (&quot;Nothing&#x27;s that important… and it&#x27;s disgusting&quot;).
* Bathroom Cobra — To keep his girlfriend (Cecily Strong) from discovering the big stink he just left in the bathroom, episode host Vince Vaughn leaves this real-life venomous cobra on the floor. A cut-for-time skit from April 2013.
* Bathroom Monkey — housewife Janeane Garofalo uses a disposable simian slave that keeps your bathroom clean.
* BeautyBath — When insurgent forces attacking Malacañang Palace gives her far too much stress, Philippine present Corazon Aquino (Jan Hooks) relaxes and recharges in &quot;[her] own private sanctuary of softness&quot; thanks to this bath soap&#x27;s &quot;soothing caress.&quot; A November 1987 parody of Calgon bath soap and its &quot;Calgon, Take Me Away!&quot; ad campaign.
* &quot;Be My Quaran-Tine&quot; — Nick (Alex Moffat) hasn&#x27;t had time to find that special someone… until he self-isolates during the COVID-19 pandemic and finds a person who shares the same interests, thoughts, etc. as he does — that person being himself. This digital-exclusive movie trailer, promoting &quot;the best coronavirus rom-com of all time,&quot; was filmed during &quot;SNL&quot;″s &quot;at home&quot; period in spring 2020.
*BeReal — A Season 48 ad for &quot;the only honest social media&quot; that requires users to post pictures of their immediate surroundings within a 2-minute window… even if those surroundings include a bank robbery in progress.
* Berkeley Collection (Up Against The Wallpaper) — Jerry Rubin sells wallpaper with popular protest slogans from the 1960s and 1970s, from angry, anti-establishment protests to slogans of peace and love.
* Beta Force — Testosterone supplements meant to give men vitality can at times work too well, turning them into overtly aggressive alpha males (especially in bed). Luckily, this supplement is a counter-agent that turns men into their paunchy, mild-mannered middle-aged selves once again.
* &quot;The Beygency&quot; — A 2014 film trailer in which episode host Andrew Garfield goes on the run from mysterious, &quot;Adjustment Bureau&quot;-style agents, all because he &quot;turned against his country&quot; and professed to not entirely being a fan of Beyoncé&#x27;s music (in particular &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;). &quot;24&quot; alums Kiefer Sutherland and Mary Lynn Rajskub have cameo appearances.
* Bierhoff House of German Coats — Two German entrepreneurs (Fred Armisen and episode host Ben Affleck) sell bright orange winter coats to German tourists vacationing in New York City.
* Big Brawn Feminine Napkins — Parodying Brawny paper towels (with a jingle set to the tune of &quot;Big Bad John&quot;), this ad shows giant lumberjack Will Ferrell turning pulp from wood into a super-absorbent (albeit rough-looking) menstruation pad. The ad is capped by Big Brawn literally tearing the roof from normal-sized Molly Shannon&#x27;s house to deliver her the product.
* Big Dumb products — Two spoofs of large-sized items from the mid-2020s promoted by flighty-voiced internet celebrities:
** Big Dumb Cups — With acknowledgements to the &quot;Big Dumb Hat&quot; ad that predates it (see below), this January 2024 spoof of the &quot;Stanley cup&quot; craze finds a trio of influencers (Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, and episode host Dakota Johnson) endorsing mugs that tell the world &quot;My favorite rapper is Kesha&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m a virgin, but I have 6 kids.&quot;
** Big Dumb Hat — This December 2022 ad asks, &quot;Are you a well-off woman with straight hair and perfect makeup?&quot; If so, top off your look with these gigantically wide-brimmed hats promoted by Fineman, Gardner, and episode host Amy Schumer (&quot;It&#x27;s the hat that makes everyone say, &#x27;Oh, her.&#x27;&quot;).
* Big Red — Made by Bleego (a parody of Mego), this water sprinkler toy depicts a Viking figure (complete with stereotypical horned Viking helmet) that spins around and sprays red liquid from its horns — liquid that is revealed to be hazardous, as evidenced by the thick utility gloves included to clean up the resulting mess.
* Bio-Flex – a parody of exercise equipment commercials where Will Ferrell is attacked by a half-man/half-monkey creature, which is considered a workout.
* &quot;Bird Bible&quot; — &quot;Your family will never be bored by scriptures again&quot; thanks to this kid-oriented pictorial version of the &quot;Bible&quot;, promoted in a March 2014 ad, that substitutes human figures with images of birds (e.g. a haloed hatchling emerges from its egg to depict Jesus&#x27;s birth).
* The Bitchslap Method – an infomercial promotes a self-help video course that teaches troubled married couples to bitch-slap their spouses into submission.
* &quot;The Black Lotus&quot; — Parodying &quot;The White Lotus&quot;, this promo promotes a drama series (&quot;coming to HBO and Starz in Spring 2023&quot;) set in a luxury hotel whose employees (Punkie Johnson, Ego Nwodim, Kenan Thompson, and episode host Aubrey Plaza) do not take kindly to the demands and antics of wealthy guests.
* &quot;Black Widow: Age of Me&quot; — Acknowledging criticism for giving female superhero characters the short shrift, Marvel Studios reciprocates with this Season 40 film trailer centered around Black Widow (episode host Scarlett Johansson, reprising her role from Marvel&#x27;s Cinematic Universe). But rather than a traditional superhero film, it&#x27;s a romantic comedy that finds Black Widow in the big city, where she works for a fashion magazine, deals with a Miranda Priestly-like boss (played by Kate McKinnon), and falls quickly into romance with supervillain Ultron.
* Bladdivan — A prescription medication (combining powerful drugs, a powerful diuretic, and anti-anxiety medications) that treats cases of &quot;shy bladder syndrome&quot; in men; side effects include &quot;peeing yourself… and not really caring that you peed yourself.&quot;
* Blaine Hotel — Part of an early running gag on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, this ad bumper has Don Pardo announcing that guests of &quot;SNL&quot; stay at the Blaine Hotel, but is usually preceded by &quot;Update&quot; reports of serious incidents (e.g. murder, virus outbreak) taking place at the Blaine.
* Blue River Dog Food — The dog food is featured in two ads:
** The first, from 2014, finds Cindy and Pat (Cecily Strong and episode host Seth Rogen) offering a testimonial for Blue River, which takes an abrupt turn when Cindy lashes out at the lack of integrity of their previous brand (i.e. it had a chicken on its packaging but only offered &quot;trace amounts of chicken&quot;).
** The second, from 2022, finds Rebecca Anne and her partner (Strong and episode host John Mulaney) berating fellow shopper Heidi Gardner for buying a cheaper, lower-quality dog food instead of Blue River (&quot;It&#x27;s only 32 cents more a day&quot;), then pleading with Gardner to buy Blue River if she ever wants to see her dog walk again (they&#x27;re shown sitting in the child seat of Gardner&#x27;s cart).
* Bok Bok&#x27;s — A March 2019 ad for a chicken restaurant that insists that its &quot;human-bird hybrid&quot; mascot, Bok Bok (Kate McKinnon), is not &quot;Momo&quot; in a chicken suit and is &quot;not tempting children with chicken to steal their souls&quot; (alluding to the social media hoax).
* Boop-It — A Bop It-like memory game that&#x27;s fun for kids of all ages — including divorced dad Beck Bennett, whose obsession of mastering the flashing toy&#x27;s honks and turns takes the fun out of time with his children.
* Booty Bidness — Rapper Ludacris (as himself) pitches a new line of women&#x27;s businesswear with racy phrases on them, such as &quot;Porn Star&quot;, &quot;Bi-Curious&quot;, &quot;Tasty&quot; (written on the rear end of a skirt), and &quot;Nympho&quot;.
* Born This Way baby clothing line — From &quot;Osh Kosh F*gosh&quot; comes this more inclusive collection of infant wear for parents who don&#x27;t want to automatically assume their toddler will conform as heterosexual or cisgender when they grow up. The onesies display such sayings as &quot;Rock-a-bi baby,&quot; &quot;Silence = violence, but crying = hungry,&quot; and &quot;I love milk… Harvey Milk! (RIP)&quot;
* Bosley – The hair transplant service offers a new procedure that borrows hair from the pubic region (or &quot;mezzanine&quot; as spokesman Jason Sudeikis refers to it); the result is a coarse and curly patch of new locks on a head that had previously been bald or thin-haired.
* Brad Pitt — Taran Killam parodies Pitt&#x27;s rambling 2012 pitch work for Chanel No. 5 with this quartet of ads including:
**A straight-up parody of the Chanel ad, with Killan&#x27;s Pitt obliging the director&#x27;s request to sound less coherent by making up words (&quot;Splindiferous,&quot; &quot;Pintalicious&quot;).
**Taco Bell, and how their Doritos Taco Loco is &quot;a great way to make a quick meal when you have between 8 and 20 children.&quot;
**Franklin&#x27;s Dog Condoms (&quot;Let your dog keep his balls&quot;)
**Jonathan Zizmor, referring to the tattoo removal specialist as &quot;The Subway Doctor&quot; for his ubiquitous advertising on New York City&#x27;s subway system.
* Bravo — The reality-heavy TV network adds more unscripted drama, each having a tenuous cast connection with the show mentioned before it, among them &quot;The Moroccans of Mulholland Drive&quot; (centered on a Morocco-born dentist with a celebrity client list), &quot;A Coppola Coconuts&quot; (featuring two granddaughters of Francis Ford Coppola), and the self-explanatory &quot;The Real Houseplants of Beverly Hills&quot;.
* Brew Dude – a hat that dispenses beer for the college student who would rather party than study.
* Broadview Security – a parody of the actual Broadview Security commercials that infer that women living alone in large houses are the most likely to be victimized by any man she meets (including male family members, androgynous singer k.d. lang, and two kids using a trenchcoat posing as an adult).
* Broderick &amp; Ganz — An ad for a team of personal injury lawyers, with happy clients praising the work of the skilled Broderick (Kate McKinnon) and one disgruntled client (episode host Aziz Ansari) disappointed over his representation by the incompetent Ganz (Bobby Moynihan).
* Brogaine — &quot;Because no one wants to be the bald guy in the frat,&quot; this version of Rogaine is designed for male college students suffering from premature hair loss caused by stress-causing factors of college life (e.g. &quot;nerds&quot;, &quot;midterms&quot;, worrying their frat dog is an alcoholic, chanting &quot;the n-word&quot; in a viral video).
* &quot;Broken&quot; — CBS, seeking the award glory that comedy dramas &quot;Transparent&quot; and &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; have earned, premieres this show centered around a family of professors (portrayed by Vanessa Bayer, Cecily Strong, and episode host Tom Hanks) who are all diagnosed with depression on the same day. The show is clearly dour and dramatic, but since it&#x27;s 30 minutes in length, CBS considers it a comedy and gives it the same lighthearted promotional approach as its sitcoms.
* &quot;Brutal Marriage Movie&quot; — This cut-for-time trailer from Season 47 promotes a movie documenting the overly dramatic struggles between a married couple played by &quot;two [scene-chewing] actors who fully expect Oscars&quot; (Heidi Gardner and episode host Rami Malek). The film comes from &quot;the producer of &quot;Marriage Story&quot;&quot; and &quot;a director going through a divorce himself.&quot;
* The Bubble — This November 2016 ad promotes a proposed domed community (formerly the New York City borough of Brooklyn) with a diverse, progressive atmosphere (hybrid cars, coffee shops, used book stores, money bearing Bernie Sanders&#x27; portrait, etc.). The community is marketed toward millennials and liberals who are scared to live in America now that Donald Trump won the presidency, but would prefer not to leave the country.
* Buddweiser Light — a parody of the Bud Light &quot;Bring Out Your Best&quot; ad campaign, featuring hockey player Joe Piscopo mentally readying himself against faceoff opponent Robin Williams. Piscopo says of Williams in the voiceover, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe my wife ran away with him,&quot; which inspires Piscopo to instigate a fight as soon as the puck is dropped. The ad ends with Williams and Piscopo sitting on the ice bloodied, gap-toothed, and enjoying a couple of beers.
* &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; — a promo for The WB series announces that with &quot;Seinfeld&quot; leaving the air, Buffy Summers (episode host Sarah Michelle Gellar) would be moving to New York to become the &quot;Elaine&quot; to an un-dead Jerry, George, and Kramer, thus transforming &quot;Buffy&quot; into &quot;A show about nothing… and vampires!&quot;
* Bug-Off – Will Ferrell appears in this parody sketch of Roach Motels. Rather than simply killing a cockroach, this bug trap painfully tortures them and &quot;gives them a lot to think about&quot;. The trap supposedly creates a signal that encourages the cockroach to enter, then adhesive glue holds the bug fast (much like a rat trap). Then, three tweezers stretch the legs in opposite directions til they snap off. Then a white-hot metal coil comes down and burns off the bug&#x27;s reproductive glands of as well as making a sizable hole. Then the bug is beat senseless by its own dismembered legs. Finally, two pieces of cotton stuffed into the cockroach&#x27;s orifices as food is dangled in front of it. Two kids are seen peering gleefully through a patented &quot;viewing window&quot;.
* Buh-Weet Sings – All grown up, Buckwheat (Eddie Murphy) from the &quot;Our Gang&quot;/&quot;Little Rascals&quot; films has recorded a compilation of songs sung in his own and very personal style, such as &quot;Fee Tines a Mady&quot;, &quot;Una Panoonah Banka&quot;, &quot;Wookin&#x27; Pa Nub&quot; and, in a dedication to his friend Alfalfa, &quot;Barbah ob Dabill&quot;.
* &quot;Bunny Business&quot; Soundtrack — Ahead of the release of an animated motion picture about &quot;a couple of bunnies with a lot of ambition,&quot; its accompanying soundtrack is promoted in this Season 35 ad. The album features songs by the likes of Randy Newman (Fred Armisen), Natalie Merchant (Kristen Wiig), and Shakira (episode host Taylor Swift).
* Burger Master – a fast food restaurant where people can get their burgers done any way they want—no matter how weird or disgusting the request may be.
* Business Garden Inn &amp; Suites &amp; Hotel Room Inn — Whether you&#x27;re staying for business travel, interventions, or &quot;after-prom hand stuff,&quot; this budget hotel will provide &quot;every amenity required by law&quot; (e.g. tightly wrapped bars of soap, &quot;curtains with sticks attached,&quot; continental breakfasts that have &quot;cereal in gumball machines&quot;). Take it from front desk clerks Kathreen and Kathlyn (Kate McKinnon and episode host Billie Eilish): &quot;As we always say, &#x27;We may not be the Ritz-Carlton.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;By Yourself: The Musical&quot; — A cut-for-time Season 48 promo for a new Broadway musical that celebrates &quot;the little songs we sing to ourselves&quot; when we&#x27;re alone and doing such minutae as eating chicken, petting cats, or shopping online.

* Calgon laundry detergent — A May 2000 parody of Calgon&#x27;s long-running ad set in a Chinese laundry (&quot;Ancient Chinese secret, huh?&quot;).

* Calvin Klein Underwear — CK spokesperson Justin Bieber (Kate McKinnon) appears in a trio of 2015 ads; though Justin says, &quot;I&#x27;m a big boy now&quot;, he behaves immaturely, poses and preens for the camera, and leaves fellow model Lara Stone (Cecily Strong) unimpressed.
* Camel Tame — When placed &quot;between your clothes and your business,&quot; this insert helps prevent the unsightly showing of a woman&#x27;s camel toe… but resembles a male bulge as a result.
* Canis Cologne for Dogs — A parody of Calvin Klein&#x27;s fragrances and accompanying sensual ads, here featuring a dog getting out of a courtyard pool and kissing (and humping the leg of) a shirtless male model.

* &quot;The Chad &amp; Mrs. Douglas Show&quot; Holiday DVD — Chad and Victoria Douglas (Taran Killam and Vanessa Bayer) promote a Time Life DVD collection of Christmas musical performances from their 1970s TV variety series, which feature guest performers who were clearly imbibing on drug &amp; drink vices of the era.
* Carter &#x27;N Sons BBQ – A commercial for a barbecue pork restaurant produced in 2002 but airing in 2009, augmented with disclaimers stating that the restaurant&#x27;s &quot;Swine Fever&quot; marketing tagline is in no way connected to the then-recent swine flu (H1N1 virus) pandemic.
*Cartier Fidget Spinner — A 14-carat-gold, diamond-encrusted fidget spinner for the woman who is glamorous yet easily distracted.

* Chalmers Reserve Event Wine — Trett and Leezan Chalmers (Kenan Thompson and Cecily Strong), former stars of the reality TV show &quot;The Nastiest Summer Renters of Sag Harbor&quot;, introduce their fine wine that&#x27;s 72% grain alcohol and costs only $1 a bottle. Why the low price? An Italian couple (Kyle Mooney and episode host Emma Stone) who makes the wine reveals an ingredient list of twigs, yellow corn, and moldy grapes that didn&#x27;t make the cut for better wines (&quot;We think it&#x27;s for the dogs&quot;).
* The Chameleon XLE — A luxury car on the inside, a dilapidated wreck on the outside — but all the better to deter the high risk of theft that accompanies luxury vehicles. The car features a simulated transmission fluid leak, mismatched hubcaps (and one exposed wheel painted school bus yellow), coat hanger antenna… and a supple leather-and-wood interior.
* Chanel and Chanel Interior Designs for Airbnb — Respectively played by episode host Sydney Sweeney and Chloe Troast, Chanel and Chanel (the latter pronounces her name &quot;channel&quot;) will design the property you&#x27;re renting out to vacationers to look as bland as possible (e.g. inoffensive artwork, 700 K-cups in the kitchen, owner closets with complicated locks).
* Chantix — Two parodies for the prescription medication used to treat nicotine addiction and its advertising that uses &quot;real people [with] real stories&quot;:
** The first, from 2012, lists mental side effects that are worse than nicotine addiction itself, which user Kristen Wiig slowly discovers she has, much to husband Bill Hader&#x27;s consternation (e.g. &quot;If you notice changes in behavior such as a powerful, overwhelming desire to kill the person you love most, call your doctor right away.&quot;).
** The second ad, from 2018, emphasizes that Chantix user Kelly (Cecily Strong) is not an actress… although she&#x27;s quick to correct that she once was, and spends the rest of the ad less praising Chantix and more resurrecting her long-dormant acting skills.
* cheapkids.net – a website dedicated to the sale of shoddy items for babies and toddlers for irresponsible parents.
* Cheques — While sending money can be as routine as clicking on a smart phone app, a check provides a noir-flavored air when paying your daughter&#x27;s boyfriend (so she&#x27;ll never see him again), your maid (so she forgets about what she saw in the gazebo), or your poison supplier (&quot;Just one sip, and I become head of the board&quot;).
* &quot;Cherry Grove&quot; — Logo pairs its upcoming reality show &quot;Fire Island&quot; with this companion series focusing on a group of affluent lesbians who, unlike the hard-partying gay men of &quot;Fire Island&quot; one beach over, get no raunchier than sharing a fondness for dinner, wine, song, jigsaw puzzles, and water birth.
* Chess for Girls! – A parody of gender-based marking of children&#x27;s toys, this chess set (unrelated to the chess game in general) features pieces with Barbie doll-style bodies and chess piece heads, an accompanying dollhouse, beachwear, minivan, bubble blower, and so on. The tag line: &quot;A classic game of strategy and wits… and bubbles!&quot;
* Chewable Pampers – A line of Pampers diapers which contain flavor crystals that, once the diaper is soiled, turns into an edible treat.
* Chia Head – a parody of both the Chia Pet and Minoxidil; men with bald or receding hairlines use this product to give them nice green hair just like a Chia Pet. (&quot;Not to be used in salads!&quot;)
* &quot;Chicago Improv&quot; — A promo for the latest series in producer Dick Wolf&#x27;s Chicago-based TV franchise, with the city&#x27;s improv comedy scene and those who populate it depicted in the same gritty, unflinching way as its firefighting and law enforcement worlds.
* Chickham Apple Farm — Just in time for the apple-picking season, Debra Chickham (Aidy Bryant), her sister (Kate McKinnon), and Hank the farmhand (episode host Woody Harrelson), promote their orchard located in &quot;the part of New York state that has Confederate flags.&quot; Visitors can have fun at the petting zoo, haunted hayride, and, yes, the apple orchard (&quot;For $45, you can bring home $10 worth of apples&quot;).
* Chonk — This clothing store offers fashions that let women be &quot;gorgeous at any size&quot;; much to the models&#x27; clear dismay, however, the store bears an uncomplimentary name. Also featured is &quot;Lil&#x27; Chonk&quot; for tween girls (Mom ushers her young model out of camera range), and the menswear store &quot;Normal Clothes&quot;, where guys can make a quick trip to find clothes in their size.
* &quot;Chris Rock&#x27;s White Person&#x27;s Guide to Surviving The Apollo&quot; — Chris Rock, a veteran of Harlem&#x27;s famed Apollo Theater, promotes his video that gives tips to aspiring white comedians and singers on how to win over Apollo&#x27;s vociferously critical audiences. Siobhan Fallon and episode host Rob Morrow appear in before-and-after footage.
* Cialis for Threeways — Erectile dysfunction medication that&#x27;s 50% stronger than regular Cialis &quot;just in case that rare opportunity arises,&quot; and also includes anti-depressants (&quot;to help you cope with the inevitable shame and regret&quot;) and Xanax (to help you make it through the argumentative fallout the next morning).
* Cialis Turnt — An ad for &quot;the only pill that combats your erectile dysfunction while giving you that unbeatable hip-hop sensation of &#x27;getting .&#x27;&quot; To demonstrate its effectiveness, Taran Killam and Aidy Bryant are shown dancing wildly to music similar to Lil Jon&#x27;s song &quot;Turn Down for What&quot; that includes the exclamation &quot;Everybody, get turnt!&quot;
* Citizens for a Better America — Dr. Swen Gazzara (Gilbert Gottfried) proves the value of hard work in America by asking Ronald Reagan to personally give him a &quot;humble job&quot; (which he shortens to &quot;hum job&quot;).
* Clancy T. Bachleratt and Jackie Snad — A quartet of ads promote collaboration albums by &quot;patriotic country musicians&quot; Clancy (Will Forte) and Jackie (Kristen Wiig), on which they perform songs about the four things they know best: Spaceships, toddlers, Model-T cars, and jars of beer.
* Clear-Rite — Karen (Kristen Wiig) speaks the praises of an &quot;invisible&quot; teeth retainer. The twist is that the product isn&#x27;t real (it&#x27;s superglue), Karen isn&#x27;t her real name (it&#x27;s Beth), and the ad isn&#x27;t an ad (Beth&#x27;s just practicing her pitch work before the bathroom mirror).
* Clearasil — Appearing in &quot;SNL&#x27;s&quot; recurring &quot;Sprockets&quot; skit, which parodied German pop culture, a young woman uses Clearasil (or, in a strong German accent, &quot;Clärasil&quot;) to get rid of her pimples and impress her new boyfriend. The English word &quot;pimples&quot;, however, is confused in the sketch with &quot;pimplen&quot;, a strong German slang word with the same meaning as the English &quot;fuck&quot; (in the sexual sense). As a result, the commercial tagline (&quot;mach das pimplen kaput&quot;) implies that Clearasil will destroy one&#x27;s sex life.
* Cleveland Cavaliers — This cut-for-time team promo from Season 43 highlights &quot;The Other Cavaliers,&quot; i.e. those who ride on the shoulders (literally) of go-to man LeBron James, including a Roomba at point guard, a golden retriever as starting center, and one player (episode host Donald Glover) who&#x27;s good at rolling the ball up the court on an inbound in order to preserve time on the shot clock.
* Closet Organizer – A man in a blue Spandex suit (Will Forte) is hired to organize anything in a closet that someone throws in.
* Clovin Hind Jeans – a parody of Calvin Klein Jeans commercials by Richard Avedon which featured numerous supermodels of the day.
* &quot;Club Shay Shay: Extended Cut&quot; — In January 2024, Katt Williams reignited feuds and made gripes against several comedians in an episode of Shannon Sharpe&#x27;s &quot;Club Shay Shay&quot; podcast. But according to this ad, 8 additional hours of Williams&#x27; (Ego Nwodim) claims are on YouTube, where he tells Sharpe (Devon Walker) that, among other things, he invented fruit, he penned Barack Obama&#x27;s &quot;Yes We Can&quot; campaign slogan, and that Hollywood made Kevin Hart &quot;in the same factory where they make Teddy Grahams&quot; (replying to a doubting Sharpe, &quot;Then why the hell he smell like cinnamon?”).
* Cluckin&#x27; Chicken – a fast-food restaurant&#x27;s animated mascot (voiced by Adam Sandler), when asked why he tastes so good, gleefully describes the process by which he is killed, decapitated, eviscerated, and flame-broiled… then, displaying a schematic chart, describes how he is consumed, digested, and eventually eliminated through defecation.
* CNN Pregnancy Test — just like its namesake network, this home pregnancy test delivers &quot;relentless breaking news&quot; alerts to a couple waiting (impatiently) to learn if they&#x27;re expecting a baby.
* CNZen — A Calm-like app for those who despise Donald Trump and seek peace in hearing CNN anchors and commentators soothingly analyze how damning a recent legal indictment is for the former president (&quot;In your mind, he&#x27;s already in jail&quot;).
* Coldcock Malt Liquor — Tim Meadows appears in this parody of Billy Dee Williams&#x27; pitchwork for Colt 45; with each sip of this beverage, an animated fist arises from the can&#x27;s label to whack the drinker upside the jaw. Ellen Cleghorne (&quot;I ain&#x27;t afraid of no can of beer!&quot;) and Chris Rock also appear.
* Cologuard — A spoof of ads for the colorectal cancer screening kit and its animated box mascot. Here, the kit, which calls himself &quot;Thomas,&quot; arrives on the doorstep of episode host Woody Harrelson, but after Woody appears uncomfortable when Thomas says, &quot;Open me up and, you know, go inside me,&quot; other animated kits, including a female caricature named &quot;Kylie,&quot; offer to step in instead.
* Colon Blow — In a parody of high-fiber cereal ads (notably Total and its &quot;how many bowls&quot; campaign), an off-screen voice tells cereal eater Phil Hartman he will need 30,000 bowls of his usual cereal to equal the fiber content in a single bowl of Colon Blow (2.5 million to equal Super Colon Blow, which is also promoted here). When the large numbers are quoted, a pyramid of the same number of bowls elevates Hartman into the ionosphere.
* Colonel Belmont&#x27;s Old Fashioned Horse Glue – Will Ferrell appears as Langford T. Belmont, a man whose family has been in the horse glue business for generations. A parody of commercials that try to appeal to old-fashioned values and tradition.
* Commode &amp; Commode — Attorneys Denzel &amp; Latrice Commode (Kenan Thompson and episode host Regina King) promise financial compensation for those facing hardships from using Gorilla Glue in place of beauty product, as has happened to members of the Commode family who offer testimonials. A spoof of the &quot;Gorilla Glue Girl&quot; story that went viral the week of this Season 46 ad.
* Complicit — a perfume specifically tailored for First Daughter Ivanka Trump (episode host Scarlett Johansson), who the voiceover positions as a glamorous yet duplicitous part of her controversial father&#x27;s (Alec Baldwin) presidency. The tagline: &quot;The fragrance for the woman who could stop all of this, but won&#x27;t.&quot;
* Compulsion – A &quot;Calvin Kleen&quot; disinfectant, parodying Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession perfume and featuring an obsessive compulsive spokesmodel (played by Jan Hooks).
* Cookie Dough Sport – a parody of Gatorade sports drink for athletes who are having a hard time and eat cookie dough out of stress and depression.
* Corn Chip Nail Tips – Maya Rudolph and Tracy Morgan appear in this parody of &quot;hip&quot; potato chip commercials, promoting corn chips that double as false fingernails.
* Corn Syrup Producers of America — In this trade group ad, Kristen Wiig inquisitively asks Nasim Pedrad about why she serves her daughter juice with high-fructose corn syrup. Pedrad responds by saying she&#x27;d rather &quot;trust scientists&quot; who espouse favorable data (e.g. corn syrup is natural, it&#x27;s okay in moderation) than &quot;stay-at-home mom Sheila from down the street who&#x27;s having wine at 10 A.M.&quot; (a catty dig aimed at a speechless Wiig).
* Count Chocula Silver — Count Chocula (Jimmy Fallon) promotes a newer version of his cereal that includes ingredients that help promote regularity and good heart health along with &quot;kooky marshmallow bats! Bwa-ah-ah-ah-ah!&quot;
* COVID — Feeling burned out from having to tend to family, friends, and work? This Season 48 ad encourages you to &quot;ask your doctor about COVID,&quot; which can guarantee a long vacation from everything despite such side effects as &quot;having COVID, which is still kind of bad, but doesn&#x27;t it feel different now?&quot; Since COVID &quot;isn&#x27;t for everybody,&quot; the Always Positive COVID-19 Home Test (which has two positive lines already drawn on) is also promoted.
* Cracklin&#x27; Oat Flakes (Now with Ecstasy) – Will Ferrell wakes up to find that he has run out of his regular Cracklin&#x27; Oat Flakes, but his wife offers this Ecastasy-laced version. After one bowl, Ferrell creeps out his coworkers, makes out with Chris Parnell, then runs half-naked through the streets until he&#x27;s seen in bed with a pacifier in his mouth and playing with a glowstick.
* Crazy Edelman — A Season 9 ad for a Crazy Eddie-like &quot;discount psychologist&quot; (Joe Piscopo) promising &quot;the lowest prices on all types of therapy&quot; (&quot;Our prices are so low, I must have an inferiority complex!&quot;).
* Creeley&#x27;s Soup — Off-screen announcer Bill Murray tries to talk a child (Gilda Radner) into exchanging the soup she&#x27;s eating for various items. When she becomes annoyed (&quot;No! Leave me alone! I&#x27;m eating!&quot;), the announcer successfully talks her into not only stuffing corn from the soup into her nose but pouring the rest onto her nose (&quot;Because the Soupman says so&quot;). The product&#x27;s tagline: &quot;Creeley&#x27;s Soup – The Child Handler&quot;.
* &quot;The Crests and Troughs of Vernon Hawley, Jr.&quot; — This &quot;special TV offer&quot; promotes a 3-record compilation from &quot;one of country&#x27;s most enduring, yet erratic, superstars&quot; (episode host John Larroquette), whose song repertoire deals with his battles with the bottle (&quot;I hope you remember these ol&#x27; tunes… &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t&quot;).
* Cricket Wireless — On the week when FEMA and the FCC tested their wireless alert system, one the White House would use only in a national emergency, this October 2018 ad makes it appear that Donald Trump will use these &quot;Presidential Alerts&quot; to express the same type of opinions he shares on Twitter. Luckily for those who use Cricket, they won&#x27;t receive such endless alerts at all (&quot;Now are you happy we have awful service?&quot;).
* Cruz for Texas — Footage from a campaign rally makes up this ad for Texas Senator Ted Cruz&#x27;s (Beck Bennett) 2018 re-election effort. While a &quot;hype team&quot; (Kenan Thompson and episode host Awkwafina) is able to liven up the crowd, things fall apart for Cruz, literally and figuratively, after he takes the stage.
* Crystal Gravy — A parody of the clear consumer products fad of the mid-1990s, specifically Crystal Pepsi. Julia Sweeney enjoys a drumstick dipped in clear gravy straight from the jar, while Kevin Nealon gleefully splashes his face in the clear, gooey liquid.
* CVS Pharmacy — For the guys who forgot to get their girlfriends something for Valentine&#x27;s Day, CVS is the perfect place to find it at the last minute, be it teddy bears in bee costumes (&quot;Bee Mine&quot;), valentine-themed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles chocolates, or a Christmas stocking priced at an 80% markdown.

== D ==
* Dad Christmas - Aidy Bryant plays a travel agent who shows two children from a divorced family (played by Pete Davidson and episode host Claire Foy) all the amenities that come with traveling to Florida to celebrate &quot;Dad Christmas&quot;: the lighting of an indoor cigarette, their father (played by Mikey Day) introducing them to an older woman named Dierdre (played by Kate McKinnon), their father getting into Jimmy Buffett music, the lack of any kind of rules and structure, and, when they&#x27;re older, the opportunity to do drugs with him. (&quot;Dad Christmas: The Sad Part About This Is That He Really Tried Hard&quot;).
* &quot;Dallas&quot;: The Home Game – Charles Rocket pitches a board game where dysfunctional families can act out their issues the same way the Ewings do on the prime time soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;.
* Damn It, My Mom Is On Facebook — When college students learn their moms just added them as Facebook friends, they can apply this filter that bowdlerizes the wild photographs and rebellious opinions they want hidden from Mom.
* Darnette Disposable Toilet – the toilet that you throw away after only one use. It takes just as many steps to install and remove as a regular toilet and costs $169.95.
* &quot;Daveheart&quot; – A movie trailer for a &quot;Braveheart&quot; sequel focusing on William Wallace&#x27;s brother and &quot;Scotland&#x27;s biggest coward,&quot; Dave Wallace (episode host Gerard Butler), who&#x27;d rather retreat or surrender than fight with the British.
* &quot;The Day Beyoncé Turned Black&quot; — A movie trailer interpreting the reaction to the release of Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Formation&quot;, a song noted for its embracing of Black heritage, as an apocalyptic-style film. White Americans are shown in mass hysteria over their realization that Beyoncé is Black while Black Americans appear apathetic.
* Deidra Wurtz, Downsizing Expert — If you need to break the news about staffing layoffs, divorces, or even pillaged Bosnian villages, let Deidra (Abby Elliott) deliver it in a sincere, caring, yet flighty way (&quot;I feel really bad about it, but it is what it is&quot;) that will leave those on the receiving end appreciative and understanding.
* Dell Stator&#x27;s 99-cent Toad Ranch – &quot;Home of the World Famous Dell Stator Toad Pit and the Dell Stator Patented Broiling Method, where we can guarantee you the best 99-cent toad steak you&#x27;ll ever eat!&quot;
* Democratic National Committee — &quot;The Dems are back!&quot; So exclaim Nancy Pelosi (Kate McKinnon), Dianne Feinstein (Cecily Strong), a Spanish-speaking Tim Kaine (Mikey Day), and other long-prominent and &quot;new faces&quot; (e.g. Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton) of the Democratic Party who are celebrating their state-level victories in 2017 but now turn to progressive issues and attracting &quot;window-lickers from Ohio [and] mouth breathers from Wisconsin&quot; who might not lean Democratic at the polls come 2018.
* Democratic Party 2018 Campaign — Progressive-leaning voters express confidence in this ad that Democratic candidates will win in the 2018 midterm elections and put the administration of Donald Trump in check… despite being visibly worried (e.g. sweaty armpits, wavering enthusiasm in their voices, drinking heavily, sudden violent behavior around friends and family, screaming so loud that glass shatters) over the possibility of a &quot;blue wave&quot; not materializing. The closing tag line: &quot;Vote! Please?&quot;
* Democrats for Ferguson — Unlike his opponent, Terry Ferguson (Will Ferrell) is not a Washington insider; does not have interns working for him; and, because he lost his testicles in a fire 23 years earlier, does not have sex with anyone. Ergo, he&#x27;s the best choice for the U.S. Senate.
* Depend Legends — Incontinent yet ashamed to wear adult diapers? You don&#x27;t have to be when Depend offers a line of diapers with images of classic stars of the past (e.g. Clark Gable, Jack Paar, Mickey Mantle). The tagline: &quot;Make History. In your pants.&quot;
* Derek Jeter&#x27;s Taco Hole – Derek Jeter pitches a taco restaurant in Nutley, New Jersey, with a jingle sung to the Beach Boys song &quot;Kokomo&quot;.
* Dianne Feinstein — After she was seen dismissing a Green New Deal proposal to combat climate change in front of a classroom full of children, the California Senator (Cecily Strong) offers to &quot;make things right&quot; in this cut-for-time political ad from Season 44. However, just as before, she spends one outtake after another arguing with students, parents, and teachers (to one kid who calls her mean, she responds, &quot;Well, your dad wishes you were bullied more; toughen you up a little bit&quot;).
* Diet Coke by Olay — Whether you drink it or splash it on your face, this facial cleanser widens your pores, defies wrinkles, and gives you &quot;fresh, clean, caffeinated skin.&quot;
* Dillon/Edwards Investments – This 1999 ad promotes a financial firm that took a slow, cautious approach to providing services on the Internet; when they were ready to do so, they took the only domain name available: &quot;www.clownpenis.fart&quot;.
* Disco Meltdown – A Season 6 ad promotes a hip, new dance club in the reactor core of a nuclear power plant.
* Discover Card — Card user Ego Nwodim is alerted to peculiar charges on her bill (e.g. giant scissors, red jumpsuits, hundreds of rabbits).

A spoof of the credit card&#x27;s &quot;We treat you like you&#x27;d treat you&quot; campaign by way of the horror film &quot;Us&quot;.
* Disney Channel Acting School — Miley Cyrus (as herself) and Raven-Symoné (Kenan Thompson) promote a school where students train to act &quot;the Disney way,&quot; learning techniques such as &quot;Disrespecting Authority,&quot; &quot;Pause Then Dis,&quot; and &quot;Reacting To Stinky Feet.&quot;
* Dissing Your Dog – Will Ferrell sells a dog training video for passive aggressive dog owners.
* &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; — This ad promotes an Off-Broadway musical that dives head-first into the contentious American political climate, though its book, songs, and cast leave a bad impression on both critics (&quot;&quot;Time Out New York&quot; calls it &#x27;Dangerously oversimplified&#x27;&quot;) and audiences (&quot;I guess the worst part of the play was their confidence in it&quot;).
* Dog Bones-n-Melodies — The 1990s hip-hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony (Ego Nwodim, Chris Redd, Kenan Thompson, and episode host Jonathan Majors) open a store that sells nothing but various types of bones for dogs (big bones, small bones, chicken bones, dinosaur bones, etc.). Make a purchase and the group will serenade you before you leave.
* &quot;Doggie Duty&quot; Soundtrack — A Season 37 ad analogous to the ones for the &quot;Bunny Business&quot; and &quot;Horse Play&quot; soundtracks that predate it. Here, Randy Newman (Fred Armisen), Florence Welch (episode host Katy Perry), and &quot;the guy from Spin Doctors&quot; (Andy Samberg) contribute tunes to a &quot;heartwarming&quot; animated movie about &quot;12 puppies selected for jury duty.&quot;
* Donald Trump&#x27;s House of Wings – Trump (as himself) promotes his own buffalo chicken wing restaurant that was once &quot;a defunct Meineke muffler shop in Englewood, New Jersey.&quot; He&#x27;s helped by endorser David Crosby (Horatio Sanz) and chicken-costumed employees (Seth Meyers, Kenan Thompson, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph) who sing a jingle set to &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot;.
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Buy Stuff You Cannot Afford&quot; – A financially struggling couple (Amy Poehler and episode host Steve Martin) hear Chris Parnell promote a book that tells of a simple way to get out of debt: &quot;If you don&#x27;t have any money, you should not buy anything.&quot;
* &quot;Don&#x27; You Go Rounin&#x27; Roun to Re Ro&quot; — A film trailer for &quot;the toughest, grittiest, most British crime drama of the year,&quot; one that appears to be about a reformed criminal (Bill Hader) who&#x27;s forced back into the business… that is, if the audience can comprehend the Cockney dialects and slang.
* Dopenhagen and Happy Daze – David Carradine plays a cowboy who likes to get high on marijuana he can chew instead of smoke. Parody of Copenhagen chewing tobacco.
* &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; — At first, it appears to be a trailer for the motion picture revival of the beloved British TV series, right down to the film&#x27;s premise (Downton is readied for a visit by the King and Queen). But it&#x27;s peppered with unflattering quotes from critics (e.g. &quot;Were the stakes in the show always this low?&quot; asks A. O. Scott). The stealthy reveal at the very end: It&#x27;s actually a promo for &quot;Joker&quot;, admitting that that comic book film is not perfect, &quot;but at least stuff happens.&quot;
* Dr. Deborah Birx Scarves — Dr. Birx (Chloe Fineman), White House response coordinator during the COVID-19 pandemic, finds it frustrating that all the public pays attention to during her briefings are the scarves adorning her outfit. But in this digital-exclusive ad from May 2020, she leans in by creating a line of scarves, including one that literally says &quot;Screw you, I&#x27;m a doctor,&quot; another in bird patterns (because Birx loves birds), and others made from periodic tables and actual CDC statements (&quot;If this is the only thing you&#x27;re zeroing in on while I&#x27;m talking, let&#x27;s make it count&quot;).

* Dr. Uncle Jimmy&#x27;s Smokehouse and Outpatient Surgical Facility – A shady clinic that offers semi-professional surgery and mediocre barbecue cuisine.
* &quot;The Drew Barrymore Show&quot; — The daytime talk show gets parodied in this Season 46 promo. &quot;After seeing what went down with &quot;Ellen&quot;,&quot; the voiceover remarks (in reference to that show&#x27;s allegedly toxic work environment), &quot;we took a hard turn in the other direction,” as evidenced by Drew (Chloe Fineman) adoring her guests, her remote audience (or &quot;VFFs — Virtual Friends Forever!&quot;), and especially her crew (&quot;they say she maintains eye contact too long and is &quot;too&quot; emotionally supportive&quot;).
* Droolers Anti-Defamation League — Wearing nerdy glasses and a face full of slobber, Chevy Chase promotes this organization that works &quot;to correct the negative image of droolers propagated by the media.&quot; Chase&#x27;s sustained chuckle in this PSA from &quot;SNL&quot;″s third episode is believed to the show&#x27;s first break of character.

* Farrow &amp; Ball — This ad starts out with Aidy Bryant telling her brother and his wife (Beck Bennett and episode host Kristen Stewart) how she used this premium paint, imported from Great Britain, to make her living room pop with vivid color (or &quot;co-LOOUR&quot; as Bryant pronounces the extra vowel in the word&#x27;s &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; spelling). But familial issues are gradually raised, including how Bryant has been spending her share of the family&#x27;s inheritance (buying paint at $110/gallon), who she&#x27;s been hooking up with (some shirtless guy she found on Facebook Marketplace), and the parentage of Bennett and Stewart&#x27;s baby.

Store features also help alleviate the trauma of clothes shopping, including faraway mirrors, quick-burning clothes (for those unsure about wearing it), and knock-out gas if a customer spends more than 30 seconds in the dressing room (a big, strong bodyguard will finish the shopping for the unconscious customer).

The simulation of, and references to, real life clearly drains one player&#x27;s (Melissa Villaseñor) enjoyment in the game.

On top of the helmet is an enormous foam rubber &quot;helmet protector&quot; with a &quot;helmet protector protector&quot; also mentioned (but too large to be shown).
* Gary Hart for President Committee — this sensually-shot ad finds a scorned woman (Jan Hooks) fighting in vain to put Gary Hart behind her, but Hart is there to remind her (and voters) that &quot;you can&#x27;t get him out of your mind,&quot; no matter what he may have done (an allusion to the allegations of extramarital affairs that plagued the charismatic Hart&#x27;s campaign for U.S. president in the late 1980s).

* GE Big Boy Appliances — In contrast to the 1950s, women are now considered the prize-winners of the house who go out and work while the men are more likely to stay home and care for the family.

* GEICO — &quot;Eric Butler (Andy Samberg) is a real GEICO customer, not a celebrity,&quot; so Whitney Houston (Maya Rudolph) is called on to help tell his accident claim story in this parody of the insurance company&#x27;s celebrities-and-customers campaign from the mid-2000s.
* Geritech — &quot;If you think I&#x27;m embarrassed endorsing the Geritech line of products, you just don&#x27;t know me.&quot; So says straight-faced episode host Leslie Nielsen at the end of this ad where endorses:
** Blotch-Off, the liver spot remover that &quot;works while you sleep.&quot;
** Dripmaster, an undergarment for those with bladder control problems (&quot;In fact, I&#x27;m relieving myself &quot;[brief pause]&quot; right now!&quot;).

* &quot;The Goombahs&quot; — Cashing in on the success of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Showtime creates its own show about a commonplace Italian-American family. The promo&#x27;s tagline: &quot;Television at its finest… and its most Italian.&quot;

** The second pair, from 2005, feature a present-day Grayson talking about his company&#x27;s knack for investing in companies that either go bankrupt or are revealed to be unscrupulous (the tagline: &quot;Losing our clients&#x27; money with dignity and pride since 1926&quot;).

But the October 2019 trailer shows that it&#x27;s not the sunny place from TV, as the street&#x27;s memorable characters (Big Bird, The Count, Cookie Monster, Mr. Snuffleupagus, Prairie Dawn, and Elmo) are depicted as sex workers, drug addicts, homeless beggars, or criminals. Oscar doesn&#x27;t appear to mind, however, reasoning to a social worker that &quot;If everyone calls you trash, and everyone treats you like trash, why don&#x27;t you just &quot;become&quot; trash?&quot;
* Gublin &amp; Green — Attorney Frank Gublin (Fred Armisen) specializes in physical and psychological injuries suffered by those performing in or attending &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, though the emoluments clients receive isn&#x27;t monetary (show merchandise, tickets to future performances).

* Hallmark Channel &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; — A promo for the network&#x27;s nearly round-the-clock block of wholesome holiday-themed films that was cut for time from a December 2017 episode. The ad checks off many of the tropes the films are famous for, including its use of familiar faces, Canadian locations, and similarly themed storylines (&quot;It&#x27;s quantity over quality, people&quot;). The films promoted here include:

**&quot;Prince Santa&quot;, with &quot;once-famous, now very Christian actress&quot; Meredith Devoe-Ellis (Melissa Villaseñor) portraying a figure skater who, after getting amnesia, falls for her kingdom&#x27;s handsome prince — played by Chris Bearstick, because Hallmark Channel got him to do &quot;two of these for no pay&quot;
* Hamburger Helper Antibacterial - Chris Parnell pitches this food item that includes the &quot;powerful antibacterial agent&quot; Tristanex to a grocery-shopping couple (Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer) unsure if the days-old hamburger meat in their refrigerator is safe to eat. Parnell&#x27;s cooking demonstration reveals, despite the product&#x27;s acrid smell, that the meat&#x27;s &quot;germ volume is almost cut in half&quot; (by 37.99% to be precise). Also promoted is Chicken Helper with Chlorine Bleach.
* Hamm &amp; Bublé — Episode host Jon Hamm and musical guest Michael Bublé (or &quot;bubbly&quot; as Hamm intentionally misprounces it) invite you to their high-class restaurant that specializes in pork dishes, sparkling champagne, and live entertainment by a visibly nervous Bublé.

As the ad&#x27;s voiceover notes, “You’ll laugh; you’ll cry; you’ll say, &#x27;Oh, this so could be me and my friends… you know, with the way things are going.&#x27;”
* Hands-Free Selfie Stick — A traditional selfie stick needs to be held with one hand. Not this version, whose long, a bendable arm reaches out over the user and is inserted (inconveniently) up their buttocks. Episode host Amy Schumer (&quot;It takes pictures?&quot;) makes an endorsement cameo.
* Happy Fun Ball – a seemingly simple children&#x27;s toy with dozens of disclaimers for absurdly dangerous health hazards and life-threatening properties, notably among them &quot;Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball&quot; and &quot;Happy Fun Ball may stick to certain types of skin.&quot;
* Harley&#x27;s Bristol Cream – a parody of Harvey&#x27;s Bristol Cream, in which Gilda Radner uses the phone to find dates and then calls out to people on the street by opening the window.
* Harvey Epstein for City Council — Episode host John Mulaney portrays the New York State Assemblyman in this Season 50 campaign ad, insisting he&#x27;s &quot;a different guy&quot; from the two notorious sex offenders he shares names with (&quot;&#x27;Harvey&#x27; I could almost handle, but &#x27;Epstein&#x27;… that thing is an albatross&quot;).
* &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; – A trailer for a horror film where smiley faces haunt potential murder victims.
* HBO — With the mega-popular &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; about to enter its final season, the network promotes &quot;prequels, sequels, and spinoffs,&quot; among them the &quot;Daria&quot;-inspired animated show &quot;Arya&quot;; Samwell Tarly and Gilly in the sitcom &quot;The King of Queens Landing&quot;; and the crossover &quot;Game of Thrones: Special Victims Unit&quot;, with Benson and Tutuola (Mariska Hargitay and Ice-T, in costumed cameos) investigating a gruesome murder in Westeros.
* Headz Up – An app that clues people into their surroundings and keeps them out of danger (e.g. &quot;A truck is coming,&quot; &quot;Your wife is speaking&quot;) while their eyes are glued to their mobile device.
* Hedley and Wyche — An ad for &quot;the British toothpaste,&quot; one infused with &quot;two teaspoons of pure cane sugar… for a smile that says, &#x27;Yum, that was good.&#x27;&quot; A spoof of the stereotype that the Brits, by and large, maintain poor dental hygiene.
* Heinz Relax — Near-empty bottles of ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard tend to make flatulent noises, leaving the user embarrassed and the butt of familial jokes at the Thanksgiving dinner table. But these redesigned bottles, when used, make a relaxing sigh… and other noises associated with sexual intercourse. (&quot;Must be 18 or over to buy.&quot;)
* Hey, You – Gilda Radner appears in this ad for a perfume for women in search of a one-night stand.
* Helmsley Spook House – Leona Helmsley (played by Nora Dunn) creates a haunted house with the same style, class, and obedient workers as her hotels.
* HelpFund — In this Season 40 parody of international aid advertisements, Charles Daniels (episode host Bill Hader) visits a poverty-stricken African village and gently tells viewers that for the daily cost of just 39 cents (this ad&#x27;s title, and a price equivalent to a small cup of coffee), villagers can receive the food, water, and medicine they sorely lack. However, the villagers (portrayed by Jay Pharoah, Kenan Thompson, Sasheer Zamata, and then-&quot;SNL&quot; writer Leslie Jones) take offense over the insultingly low amount. Daniels gives them increasingly weak defenses for a figure that &quot;has been decided by very educated and caring people who can save your lives,&quot; until he finally admits he does not even know what country he&#x27;s actually in (&quot;Africa?&quot;). The ad ends with Jones&#x27; character demanding viewers send $200 &quot;if you wanna see this cheap-ass white man again.&quot;
* Herbal Essences for Men — Attorney Amy Poehler has already &quot;got the urge,&quot; but opposing counsel Will Ferrell and other men in the courtroom get it too in this parody of Clairol&#x27;s shampoo line and its playfully sensual ad campaign.
* Herman &amp; Sons Sperm Bank — George Herman (episode host Seth Rogen) and Eugene Sons (Kenan Thompson) announce a going-out-of-the-business sale at &quot;the oldest sperm bank in greater Lansing;&quot; they&#x27;re turning the space into a TCBY franchise, so they need to get rid of their sperm stock to assure &quot;minimal sperm-to-yogurt crossover.&quot;
* Heroin AM — An over-the-counter form of heroin for those who want to take the drug yet remain productive parents, workers, etc. Though panned for painting the Opioid epidemic in the United States in a humorous tone, the 2016 ad was also lauded for highlighting the issue in the first place, including the drug&#x27;s dangerous risks (&quot;Side effects include… it&#x27;s heroin, so all that stuff&quot;) and its impact on people from all walks of life.
* HiberNol – &quot;From the makers of ComaDose&quot; comes this NyQuil-like cold medicine that knocks a person out for the entire cold and flu season. Pitchman Phil Hartman (&quot;You can&#x27;t buy stronger medication… in this country&quot;) and Chris Farley appear in this Season 18 ad.
* Hillary Clinton — Wanting to lure some of the younger voters attracted to Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primaries, Clinton (Kate McKinnon) starts taking some of the same campaign stands, so much to the point that she slowly begins to mimic the Brooklyn-accented Vermont Senator (&quot;I&#x27;m whoever you want me to be, and I approve this message. I&#x27;m trying, you guys.&quot;).
* Hire The Incompetent – &quot;Why should someone who is already good at their job win out over someone who is poor at theirs?&quot; So says episode host Charles Grodin in this Season 3 PSA that offers testimonials from unskilled workers, among them Roseanne Roseannadanna (Gilda Radner&#x27;s first performance of the recurring character).
* &quot;The Hobbit&quot; sequels — Director Peter Jackson stretches the film trilogy into a 19-part series, all filmed in &quot;S#!T-Vision&quot; and featuring such filler material as delaying a march to Smaug&#x27;s lair (because something was left behind at The Shire); Gandalf trying to remember a name; splitting a dinner bill; and &quot;The Elf Queen&quot; (episode host Jennifer Lawrence) deciding on what outfit to wear.
* &quot;Holding Your Own B--bs&quot; Magazine – Episode host Sarah Michelle Gellar is topless in this ad promoting a magazine exclusively dedicated to photos of male and female celebrities cupping their breasts. The ad spoofs the numerous copycat magazine covers that re-created Janet Jackson&#x27;s famous 1993 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover.
* Home Security Decoy – mannequins posing as criminals already breaking into a house to trick real thieves into thinking it&#x27;s already being robbed.
* Homocil – a special drug that helps reduce the stress of parents whose male children express homosexual tendencies. The tag line: &quot;Because it&#x27;s your problem, not theirs.&quot;
* Hoops — Gino&#x27;s girlfriend (episode host Jennifer Lopez) and her cousin (Melissa Villaseñor) promote a store where they sell customized, 100%-metal hoop earrings (&quot;So luxurious, they&#x27;ll turn your ears the color of money&quot;).
* Horizon System 12 — After Zenith introduces its System 3 line of television sets, Horizon Corporation tops it with &quot;a masterpiece&quot; of a TV set, one that produces high-performance sound and pictures… but is revealed at the end to be a gigantic console with massive speakers and a relatively minuscule picture tube.
* &quot;Horny Little Dork&quot; — A cut-for-time movie trailer from Season 49 depicts the horror women encounter when their husbands become aroused upon seeing them step out of the shower, working out, or showing just a little bit of skin — sexually dorky behavior that, Bowen Yang&#x27;s genealogist character determines, has affected married men for millennia.
* &quot;Horse Play&quot; Soundtrack — From Season 36, the soundtrack to an upcoming animated film about horses who play baseball features &quot;totally original&quot; songs from Randy Newman (Fred Armisen), Alanis Morissette (episode host Anne Hathaway), and The Cranberries&#x27; Dolores O&#x27;Riordan (Kristen Wiig).
* Hotel-Motel Art Fair — Tom Clay (Harry Shearer) pitches art events that sell paintings that once hung in various hotel and motel rooms.
* &quot;Hot Girl Hospital&quot; — A promo for a new medical drama &quot;from Shonda Rimes and the top commenters on The Shade Room&#x27;s Instagram&quot; that features three hospital staffers (Punkie Johnson, Ego Nwodim, and episode host Megan Thee Stallion) who, when lives are on the line, &quot;will answer the call, say something rude, and hang up.&quot; Critiques one reviewer from &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable reviewing this as a white guy. Five stars.&quot;
* Hot Sauce Carry Purse by Tabasco — In case the party you&#x27;re attending doesn&#x27;t have any hot sauce at the buffet table, bring your own sauce in this purse (&quot;available at Wilsons Leather&quot;) that&#x27;s &quot;insulated and calibrated to keep your [various] sauces organized and fresh.&quot;
* Hoverboards — This December 2015 ad plays up on the popularity of self-balancing scooters and their propensity to catch fire (it&#x27;s the gift that says &quot;I hate walking, but I love fires&quot;).
* &quot;How to Order Sushi Like a CEO&quot; – a pompous executive (episode host Matt Dillon) promotes his book (that he hired someone else to write) on how to order at sushi restaurants, all the while patronizing sushi restaurant waitress Maya Rudolph (&quot;Anything else, Mr. Douche?&quot;).
* HuckaPM — How does White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), sleep at night after a long day of making outlandish statements in defense of the Trump administration? With this sleep aid that combines Melatonin, extra strength quaaludes, and the &quot;One and Dones&quot; prescribed to Michael Jackson by his doctor. One tablet puts Sanders instantly to sleep.
* Huggies Thong – useless diapers shaped like thongs; parodies the increasing phenomenon of the sexualization of young children, and parents who allow their children to dress in risqué, revealing clothing more suited for adults.

== I ==
* &quot;I Know Why The Caged Bird Laughs&quot; — A promo for a new TV show featuring Maya Angelou (played by Maya Rudolph) pulling pranks on her circle of celebrity friends; the pranks include putting a pie on Morgan Freeman&#x27;s (Jay Pharoah) chair, taking the bottom out of Dr. Cornel West&#x27;s (Kenan Thompson) suitcase, and interrupting Stephen King&#x27;s (Bill Hader) book signing to tell him that his car has been towed.

* iPhone — Fred Armisen plays a man who uses his iPhone to keep his relationship with his pregnant wife separate from his affair with a French-Canadian woman whom he loves more. (In the NBC rebroadcasts, this was replaced with another iPhone ad, this time with Jason Sudeikis as a man who uses his iPhone to elude the police.)
* ISIS — A controversial Season 40 parody of a Toyota Camry ad that featured a proud father driving his daughter to the airport, where she departs for U.S. Army training. Here, however, the daughter (episode host Dakota Johnson) is being picked up not by an Army representative but by Islamic State militants, as her father (Taran Killam) looks on with apprehension. The ad was both blasted for mining comedy out of ISIS&#x27; atrocious actions and applauded for daring to ridicule the terrorist group.
*i-sleepPRO — This ambient sleep aid that has settings for &quot;white noise&quot; and &quot;black noise&quot;; the latter includes thumping bass music, dialogue from Tyler Perry sitcoms and the movie &quot;Friday&quot;, domestic arguments, and an old woman complaining about her foot pain. Jay Pharoah provides voice work for the device.
*It Gets Better Project — A decade after its founding, the nonprofit organization providing positive advice to LGBT youth calls on four previous recipients (played by Punkie Johnson, Kate Mckinnon, Bowen Yang, and episode host Dan Levy, all openly LGBT-identifying in real life) to advise the youth of today that it will indeed get better for them… but that they&#x27;ll encounter the same types of problems (e.g. income taxes, annoying family members, criticism over musical tastes, kids&#x27; pet iguanas) that Levy&#x27;s character notes were &quot;previously only available to straight people… and &quot;that&quot; is progress.&quot;

== J ==
* J.J. Casuals – Jack Johnson (Andy Samberg) promotes shoes shaped like bare feet for those who are as casual as he is.
* Jack Flatts — The fast casual restaurant chain talks of its adjustment to providing curbside delivery due to COVID-related restrictions against indoor serving (&quot;We know how much you miss coming in&quot;). But 27 seconds into the ad, the transmission is interrupted by thrash metal music and what appears to be a group of militia members demanding that the state reopen Jack Flatts and lift mask-wearing mandates; if their demands aren&#x27;t met… &quot;[low voice]&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re gonna kidnap the governor.&quot;
* Jake&#x27;s Non-Stick Underwear for Men — Made from the same durable ceramic coating found in cookware, this prescription-only underwear is built for men who want their undergarments as rough and tough as they are, and who&#x27;d rather not go through the embarrassment of double bagging and disposing of their old, soiled-beyond-salvation underwear.
* &quot;The JaMarcus Brothers: Now Is the Time for a Tickle Fight, He He!&quot; — An ad for a CD featuring slow jam songs from the JaMarcus Brothers: Marcus (Kenan Thompson), Darnell (Jay Pharoah) and &quot;adopted white virgin&quot; Englebert (episode host Christoph Waltz).
* Jamitol – A parody of Geritol in which a husband (Chevy Chase) extols the virtues of the multivitamin that has kept his wife (Michael O&#x27;Donoghue) working to the point of exhaustion. &quot;My wife. I think I&#x27;ll stuff her!&quot;
* Jam Hawkers – Carrying the Smucker&#x27;s slogan (&quot;With a name like Smucker&#x27;s, it has to be good!&quot;) to absurd extremes, this Season 1 skit finds &quot;SNL&quot; cast members outdoing each other in endorsing, in the following order, fruit preserves so good that the manufacturers dare to give them names that are more horrible and disturbing then the last:
** Jane Curtin – Fluckers: &quot;It&#x27;s got to be good!&quot;
** Chevy Chase – Nose Hair: &quot;You can imagine how good it must be… mm–mm!&quot;
** Dan Aykroyd – Death Camp: &quot;Just look for the barbed wire on the label!&quot;
** John Belushi – Dog Vomit &amp; Monkey Pus: &quot;This stuff has got to be terrific!&quot;
** Chevy Chase – Painful Rectal Itch: &quot;The taste? &quot;[mimicking chef&#x27;s kiss]&quot; MMM WAH!&quot;
** Dan Aykroyd – Mangled Baby Ducks: &quot;Great jam! Beautiful jam!&quot;
** John Belushi – 10,000 Nuns and Orphans: (responding to Jane&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s so bad about that?&quot; inquiry) &quot;They were all eaten by rats! Oh so good!&quot;
** Garrett Morris, who mumbles the name of the jam he&#x27;s brought in, one Jane assures the audience is &quot;the brand so disgusting you can&#x27;t say it on television.&quot;
* Jar Glove – A parody of commercials that use black-and-white dramatizations to show someone struggling to perform an everyday task without the use of the product being sold. Here, a housewife (Kristen Wiig) accidentally kills her husband (Jason Sudeikis), resists arrest, is sentenced, goes to prison, plots and executes an escape, and hides out from prison guards—all because she struggled with opening the lid on a jar without benefit of the Jar Glove.
* Javis Home Security Systems – This Season 25 ad starts off as a pitch for baby wipes, featuring a man (Will Ferrell) reminiscing about the first time he changed his baby&#x27;s diaper while changing a newborn. But it&#x27;s not his child, as evidenced the baby&#x27;s mother (Ana Gasteyer) becoming frantic upon entering the room (&quot;Who the hell are you?!&quot;) and rushing to her infant while he makes a quick escape out of the window. The closing tag line: &quot;Javis Home Security Systems. Because there are a lot of dirty creatures.&quot;
* Jenson Mint – Phony currency rich people can give to homeless panhandlers, so that they can leave them alone once and for all.
* &quot;Jeannie Darcy: Selective Startage&quot; — Episode host and &quot;SNL&quot; alum Molly Shannon reprises her standup comedienne character in this Season 48 promo for Netflix&#x27;s &quot;second ever live global event&quot;… though just as before, Jeannie&#x27;s jokes, uninspiring delivery, and her &quot;don&#x27;t get me started, don&#x27;t &quot;even&quot; get me started&quot; catchphrase fall flat with a dumbfounded audience.
* Jewess Jeans – Gilda Radner is the model in this parody of Jordache jeans (and, to a lesser extent, Levy&#x27;s rye bread). The Levy&#x27;s-like tag line advises that &quot;no one has to be Jewish&quot; to wear Jewess (&quot;but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt&quot;, Radner adds).
* Jiffy Express – When you forgot your package had to be at its destination yesterday, Jiffy says &quot;We&#x27;ll take the package… AND the blame&quot; by back-dating packages and simulating shipping delays.
* Jiffy Pop Air Bag – Eat popcorn while you&#x27;re waiting for the ambulance to arrive.
* Jogger Motel – A parody of the commercials for Black Flag Roach Motel roach traps. Its tagline read, &quot;Joggers jog in, but they don&#x27;t jog out&quot;.
* &quot;Joe Caucasian&quot;, &quot;Joe Dude&quot;, &quot;Joe Hetero&quot;, and &quot;Joe Not-a-Rapist&quot; — Promos for Fox reality shows based on &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;, where a bachelor tricks female contestants into thinking he (or in the case of &quot;Joe Dude&quot;, she) is white, a male, a heterosexual, or not a convicted serial rapist.
* Jon Hamm&#x27;s John Ham – the actor promotes ham you can eat while sitting on the toilet, complete with a dispenser similar to that of toilet paper.

== K ==
* K-Put Price-Is-Rite Stamp Gun — A price-stamp gun that allows shoppers to freely alter the prices of various goods (particularly groceries) in their own favor.
* Kannon AE-1 — A camera that&#x27;s &quot;so simple, so advanced, even Stevie Wonder [as himself] can use it,&quot; though the photos he takes of tennis pro John Newcombe (Joe Piscopo) are off-center or out of focus. A spoof of ads for Canon&#x27;s AE-1 SLR.
* &quot;Kate &amp; Ali&quot; — a series of promos for a spoof of &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;—only instead of two divorced women, it&#x27;s screen legend Katharine Hepburn (Martin Short) sharing a domicile with boxing great Muhammad Ali (Billy Crystal).
* KCF Shredders — Lampoons fast food industry&#x27;s marketing to kids, in this case with lettuce. &quot;Now with How Stella Got Her Groove Back action figures!&quot;

Take a right, however, and you&#x27;ll get into the source of the brothers&#x27; animosity, &quot;these trendy [fast food] chains with massive drive-thru lines&quot; (in particular Raising Cane&#x27;s).
* Kohler Co. toilet fixtures — Two ads that feature a stylishly-suited protagonist (episode host Benedict Cumberbatch), an angry adversary (Mikey Day), and dark settings to promote new, stylish toilet designs from the plumbing company that&#x27;s been &quot;#1 in #2 since 1873&quot;
** Koohl Toilet — This toilet, promoted in a Season 42 spoof of the classic &quot;1984&quot; ad that introduced Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computer (complete with Cumberbatch carrying a sledgehammer), allows one to sit “the cool way”—backwards, with their arms casually draped over the tank—as opposed to the forward-facing old toilets Big Brother (Day) has dictated the proletariat use.
** ReKhline — In this Season 47 ad, the setting is now a schoolroom, and Cumberbatch now drops trow on a recliner-like toilet, complete with extendable footrests and tank as backrest; it upsets Day&#x27;s stern teacher, who has just taught his pupils that &quot;there&#x27;s only one acceptable way to sit on the toilet&quot; (sitting upright, feet firmly on floor).
* Kool-Aid — The same week Gillette launched its &quot;The Best Men Can Be&quot; campaign, which encouraged men to become better role models, this January 2019 PSA calls out the Kool-Aid Man and paints his longtime propensity to crash through walls as a bad influence of masculine behavior on both boys (Colin Jost&#x27;s son plunges through another kid&#x27;s play set) and grown men (Alex Moffat bursts through a conference room door and interrupts Heidi Gardner&#x27;s business presentation).
* Kotex Classic — a very large sanitary napkin, attached to a belt and clearly visible under a woman&#x27;s clothing, very much like the sanitary napkins worn by women and girls of the 1950s.

== L ==

* Lanzetti&#x27;s Lawn Care — Steve and Sandy Lanzetti (Mikey Day and episode host Maya Rudolph) promise their company will handle all your landscaping needs… and only hire sexually awkward, socially repellent workers who won&#x27;t get it on with your wife (&quot;The only temptation is our low prices&quot;).
* The Laughing Buddha — Episode host Howard Hesseman promotes a health food store that sells novelty items people can use to play pranks on vegetarians, vegans, and those into the organic lifestyle.
* &quot;Law &amp; Order: Parking Violations Unit&quot; — A promo for the latest addition to the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise, this one centered on the police who investigate parking crimes and the district attorneys who prosecute the ticket-challenging offenders.
* Leave Me Alurn — If women want to avoid small talk with men, they can use this &quot;conversation prophylactic&quot; in the shape of a funerary urn to make men think they want to be left alone while they spread their loved one&#x27;s ashes. It&#x27;s from the makers of Lower Back Spikes, a belt used for women who are sick of men touching them on the smalls of their backs when they walk past them.
* Leevi&#x27;s Three-Legged Jeans — Various &quot;SNL&quot; cast members cavort about in these jeans that feature a redundant third leg in the middle. The Season 17 ad features a reggae-tinged jingle, various catchphrases (e.g. &quot;Three at Last,&quot; &quot;A leg and a leg and a leg&quot;), and this ad-ending remark from Tim Meadows: &quot;Hey, not any dumber than acid-washed.&quot;
* Lemon Glow — Ex-biker chick Molly Shannon wistfully recalls her drugs-and-sex days while cleaning the suburban home (and related family life) she&#x27;s conned herself into, using this household cleaner &quot;for the home you &quot;weren&#x27;t&quot; sure you wanted.&quot;
* Leland-Meyers Home Headache Test (HHT) — Run a &quot;moderate amount&quot; of your blood in a centrifuge, place one drop on a test strip, and in two hours you&#x27;ll learn whether or not you actually have a headache.

* &quot;Lesbian Period Drama&quot; — &quot;From the makers of &quot;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&quot; and &quot;The Favourite&quot;&quot; comes this hauntingly-lensed film featuring a cold, seaside setting, c. 1840; two straight actresses (Heidi Gardner and episode host Carey Mulligan) in the lead roles; 12 lines of dialog in a 2-hour run time; and &quot;a sex scene so graphic, you&#x27;ll think, &#x27;Oh, right, a man directed this.&#x27;&quot;
* Levi&#x27;s Wokes — sizeless (i.e. baggy), style-neutral (i.e. grayish brown), gender non-conforming denim jeans for a generation that defies labels.
* Lexon Paradox — Two automotive design teams produced two completely opposite cars (e.g., one was the most expensive car ever, the other the cheapest; one was the safest, the other designed to throw flaming victims hundreds of feet in a crash). In the end, the two were combined to create The Paradox.
* Lexus — The luxury car maker&#x27;s &quot;December to Remember&quot; sales event is parodied in this 2020 ad that finds Beck Bennett surprising his wife and son (Heidi Gardner and episode host Timothée Chalamet) with a new Lexus sedan on Christmas morning, complete with a red bow on the roof. But Gardner is more horrified than surprised, considering Bennett has been out of a steady job for well over a year, thought the car cost only $3999 (that&#x27;s just the down payment &quot;due at signing&quot;), and got neighbor Mikey Day to loan him the money. The closing tag line: &quot;Give the gift of Lexus, and definitely talk it over first.&quot;
* Liberty Medical — Wilford Brimley (episode host John Goodman) begins his pitch for this medical supply delivery service by explaining how, with &quot;dye-a-beetuss&quot;, he has to take extra care of his health, but continually qualifies, and admits to exaggerations, until by the end, he&#x27;s described hiding a &quot;food boner&quot; over delivery of $200 worth of pork ribs to his house, never having moved fast enough to sweat, and the fact that he may not even have diabetes—his doctor &quot;just thinks I look like the kinda guy who &quot;would&quot; have it&quot;.
* Liberty Mutual — A cut-for-time parody of the insurance company&#x27;s &quot;LiMu Emu and Doug&quot; campaign from Season 49 finds Doug (played by episode host Shane Gillis) and his emu partner breaking down the door of a man (Marcello Hernández) who&#x27;s been &quot;paying for coverage they don’t need.” It ends horribly, though, when the emu shoots the man in cold blood and, before pulling a brick of cocaine from under the couch, plants an unmarked gun next to his body. LiMu&#x27;s response upon Doug discovering his partner is a dirty cop: &quot;We&#x27;re in a bad part of town.&quot;
* Lil&#x27; General Fireworks — A fireworks manufacturer promotes their product as a family-friendly way turn any boring weekend into the 4th of July.
* Lil&#x27; Poundcake — This Season 37 ad promotes a doll that&#x27;s not only sweet enough for girls to play with, it gives them an FDA-approved HPV vaccination shot when they least expect it. The closing tag line: &quot;The only thing you&#x27;re gonna get infected with… is fun!&quot;
* Lincoln Financial — Three spoofs of the investment company&#x27;s &quot;Get to know the future you&quot; campaign, specifically an ad in which an airline passenger meets the future version of himself.
**In Ad #1, a man (Jason Sudeikis) has oral sex with his future self;
**Ad #2 finds another man (Bill Hader) learning from his future self that he&#x27;s going to gain weight, go bankrupt, fly to Hawaii, and kill himself (but not before making out with him)
**Ad #3 finds another man (episode host Ben Stiller) mistaking a female passenger (Abby Elliott) for his transgender future self.
* Lincoln MKC — Episode host Jim Carrey lampoons Matthew McConaughey&#x27;s existential pitchwork for Lincoln&#x27;s crossover utility vehicle in this trio of ads. McConaughey gets so lost in his deep thoughts that in the third ad, he drives right through an Allstate commercial parody, hitting Allstate pitchman Dennis Haysbert (Kenan Thompson) in the process. Carrey would later reprise this spoof in the &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy&quot; sketch in &quot;SNL&quot;″s 40th Anniversary Special.
* Lite Beer — Bill Cosby (Eddie Murphy), much as he does with Jell-O, promotes the virtues of Lite to a table of children in this Season 6 ad, including telling them Fat Albert drinks it (&quot;soon he won&#x27;t be fat anymore, he&#x27;ll just be Albert&quot;) and pouring it into their cupped hands (to demonstrate how &quot;light&quot; it is).
* Little Brothers — An ad similar in vein to Peyton Manning&#x27;s &quot;United Way&quot; commercial; here, Manning&#x27;s younger brother Eli is ambassador of a mentoring program for young boys who need a strong, male role model in their lives — and someone to beat up their mean older brothers (one of which, played by Andy Samberg, is locked in the trunk of a car and mistakenly referred to as &quot;Peyton&quot;). The commercial ends with the tag line &quot;Little Brothers: Because the time of reckoning is now at hand&quot;, followed by Eli and his young charges laughing maniacally.
* Litter Critters — Cheri Oteri appears in this sketch about a kit that allows children to take their cat&#x27;s fecal waste and mold it into fun figurines. &quot;♪♫ When you hear a scratch, here comes a batch — It&#x27;s time for Litter Critters! ♪♫&quot;

**In part two, a businessman (Seth Meyers) calls his friend for the number of a Dutch man who can help him remove a Thai hooker who ended up dead after he had sex with her.

Also joining the businessman is Affleck, wearing a pink robe, earrings, and makeup and asking the Dutchman (played by Darrell Hammond) if he&#x27;s interested in buying panda meat, and a paranoid Kelly Ripa (in a cameo appearance) wielding a meat cleaver and exhorting the businessman to cut the prostitute up and put the remains in a bag.
* Oops! I Crapped My Pants – A parody of ads for adult diapers (e.g. Depends) that also plays on the use of statements as product names (e.g. &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter!&quot;).

**A second ad from Season 37 has the same comedians, but replaces &quot;Airhorn&quot; Schultz with Dirk &quot;Jack Knife&quot; Cane (episode host Charlie Day), a Dane Cook-esque comic known for a rude finger gesture known as &quot;The Jack-Knife&quot;.
**A third ad from later in Season 37 (though cut-for-time after dress rehearsal) features episode host Mick Jagger as Denny Cumberbatch, a flamboyant, Cockney British comedian (think Russell Brand) whose punchline is &quot;A bit weird, innit?&quot;
* Oxxon — The oil company blames the high production costs for their elaborately produced commercials as an excuse for high energy prices. A parody of Exxon&#x27;s &quot;Energy for a Strong America&quot; campaign (&quot;Energy for a gullible America&quot; is the closing tagline here).
* Ozempic for Ramadan — The injectable drug for weight and hunger management is marketed to Muslims observing the &quot;fard&quot; of dawn-to-sunset fasting during the month of Ramadan.

== P ==
* Pan Am – Thanks to good security and low fares, it&#x27;s a good time to fly because of their best offer: Fly to Brussels, Rome or London, you get to keep the plane you flew on.
* Pandora charms — For the woman &quot;who makes the holidays merry and bright,&quot; the man in her life can give her assorted bracelet charms that acknowledge her various traits and interests (e.g. if she drinks coffee, a coffee cup; if she works as a nurse, a nurse&#x27;s hat).
* Paperless Post — This e-invitation service isn&#x27;t above nudging those who don&#x27;t respond, thanks to features including Paperless Brick (thrown through a window), Paperless Horse&#x27;s Head, Paperles Severed Finger, Paperless Their Car Explodes, and for those who complain on social media about receiving the invite, Paperless Wild Dogs. The end of this cut-for-time ad from Season 49 mentions it&#x27;s sponsored by the United States Postal Service (&quot;Send a physical invite they can&#x27;t pretend they didn&#x27;t see&quot;).
* Paul Ryan for President — Speaker of the House Ryan (Taran Killam) makes this presidential campaign ad to insist he&#x27;s not running for the presidency (&quot;I did &quot;not&quot; approve this message&quot;)… although if he were to do so, he&#x27;d run on a platform of cutting taxes, creating jobs, etc. A parody cut for time from an April 2016 episode.
* &quot;Paw Patrol&quot; — This ad starts out as a run-of-the-mill (and live-action) scene from the animated Nickelodeon series, with Mayor Goodway (Ego Nwodim) honoring the titular all-canine patrol for protecting Adventure Bay. But it&#x27;s only an intro to an attack ad (&quot;Paid for by cats&quot;) that endorses a recall election against Goodway. City Councilman Herb Tangier (episode host Oscar Isaac) and &quot;concerned citizens&quot; in the ad imply that putting trust in a force consisting solely of 6 dogs &quot;can&#x27;t protect a city the size of San Diego&quot; from murders, carjackings, and other more serious crimes.
* Paxil—Second-Term Strength — An anti-depressant made especially for Barack Obama (Jay Pharoah) as he tries to deal with his second term as president and all of the scandals and failures (such as the Benghazi scandal, the IRS scandal, General Petraeus&#x27;s sex scandal, and Obamacare). Also available in Republican Strength for John Boehner (Taran Killam) dealing with the stress of Tea Party members protesting against Obama&#x27;s administration.
* Pelotaunt — Peloton&#x27;s fitness equipment features streaming video classes with positive encouragement. But for exercise buffs desiring results through negative reinforcement, this fitness bike provides such &quot;patented passive aggressive technology&quot; as video instructors offering withering judgement instead of corny speeches; video screens with gaslighting statistics and camera views of your flabby butt; and comical music (specifically the theme from &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;) rather than motivating melodies. As one user (Beck Bennett) puts it, &quot;I feel mentally broken down, but, hey, I can see my abs.&quot;
* Penne alla Vodka — For every kind of celebration (graduations, weddings, funeral banquets, etc.), it&#x27;s the pasta dish that&#x27;s &quot;loved by none, but tolerated by all.&quot;
* Pep Boys Genderflect campaign — Mirroring Starbucks&#x27; &quot;#RaceTogether&quot; campaign, which encouraged conversations about race between its employees and customers, the auto parts chain promotes its own initiative to discuss LGBTQ and gender identity issues. The mechanics and parts people, however, voice opinions on the subject that can be considered politically incorrect, much to their customers&#x27; discomfort.
* Pepto-Bismol Ice – Nasim Pedrad appears in this sketch about the famous pink antacid in malt liquor form.
* Petchow Rat Poison – In this parody of misleading labels, Hank Petchow&#x27;s (Will Ferrell) brand of rat poison looks like dog food, is packaged in a 25 lb. bag with &quot;PetChow&quot; in large print, has a large photo of Petchow&#x27;s dog, and the words &quot;rat poison&quot; in the very fine print.
* &quot;Philadelphia&quot; Action Figures – The acclaimed 1993 legal drama inspires this set of figures kids can use to create &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;-style playtime adventures. Also featured is a &quot;Philadelphia&quot; video game from Sega Genesis (footage from Sega&#x27;s port of Galaxy Force II is used as a stand-in).
* Phil Hartman Creations — You, too, can slip into any different character when donning a wig, as Hartman enjoys doing so at &quot;SNL&quot; (&quot;You can change wigs as often as you change your mood!&quot;).
* The Phone Company – Episode host Lily Tomlin appears as her grouchy, apathetic operator character Ernestine, who relates the goings-on and imperfections of her equally indifferent employer, succinctly stating &quot;We don&#x27;t care. We don&#x27;t have to. We&#x27;re the Phone Company.&quot;
* Pier 1 Imports — In this November 2002 parody, Kirstie Alley (episode host Nia Vardalos) tells stressed businesswoman Rachel Dratch &quot;you need &quot;shopping&quot; therapy&quot; and forcefully drags her to Pier 1… excitable actions by the home decor chain&#x27;s spokesperson that viewers are advised they should steer clear of (&quot;Only &quot;you&quot; can protect yourself from Kirstie Alley&quot;).
* &quot;Pilates&quot; — Chloe Fineman and Molly Kearney walk into the dark, foreboding, and neon-hued world that is a pilates class in this horror movie trailer &quot;from the creator of &quot;Saw X&quot; and marketing director for Alo&quot; that features episode host Kristen Wiig as a menacing yet cheerful instructor and her &quot;Palm Royale&quot; co-star Kaia Gerber in a cameo.
* Pink Box — Gilda Radner has felt so confident since buying this nameless, mysterious product in plain pink packaging (and a black triangle its only marking), and is vague when tennis partner Laraine Newman questions what it is (&quot;Is it welcomed protection against odor all year round?&quot; Radner: &quot;&quot;Possibly&quot;.&quot;)
* Pinx Period Underwear — Able to &quot;hold up to 12 hours of you know what,&quot; this super-absorbent, eco-friendly underwear can help women keep their menstrual cycle discreet… even if animals can detect it (as happens to episode host Amy Schumer in this Season 48 ad).
* The Player-With-Yourself Club – Telly Savalas (Phil Hartman) promotes a discount card for chronic masturbators.
* Pocket Pal — Businessman Dan Aykroyd promotes &quot;the &quot;last&quot; word in personal electronic systems,&quot; a device with &quot;THOUSANDS of micro-processors, which electronically duplicate the sensing mechanisms of the silver-haired bat&quot; and warns users of possible mid-air plane collisions… such as the one that puts Ackroyd and his fellow passengers into a panic (&quot;We&#x27;re gonna collide with a 747!!&quot;).
* Pongo! — A 4-legged, anamorphic pet that&#x27;s &quot;no mess, no bark, no bite,&quot; does very few tricks, is neither alive nor dead, and is no problem for parents who think their kids aren&#x27;t ready to care for a real pet… until its unblinking eyes unnerve the mother of the family (Sarah Sherman) in this holiday toy ad from Season 49.
* Pornhub — A parody of the &quot;we&#x27;re here for you&quot; outreach ads businesses produced early in the COVID-19 pandemic, with various adults indulging on the pornography website&#x27;s content while sheltering at home.
* PottyPM — Promoting a device that allows the user to use the bathroom in the middle of the night without getting out of bed, this ad takes a turn halfway through when episode host Jennifer Lopez asks whether it&#x27;s also made for women, a question pitchman Kyle Mooney responds to with clear unfamiliarity of the female anatomy.
* Pre-Chewed Charlie&#x27;s – A steakhouse for people with dentures, where the waiters come to your table and chew your food for you.
* &quot;Pregnant in Heels&quot; — A promo for a Bravo reality series that follows Rosie Pope (Abby Elliott), a maternity concierge who provides expectant mothers with anything they want, no matter how extreme. For example, client Shoshanna Bunt (episode host Tina Fey) asks Rosie for a delivery room that&#x27;s &quot;total VIP&quot; and a water birth that has Diet Coke instead of water.
* Preparation H – The hemorrhoidal creme has been spoofed in two ads:
** The first, from the Season 27 premiere, features Jimmy Fallon and other skateboarding dudes talking of using the creme in urban slang (&quot;I&#x27;m about ta drop an H-BOMB on dis rizzoid!&quot; &quot;In whacked out cream or jiggity jiggity jelly!&quot;).
** A second ad, from Season 41, finds Beck Bennett discreetly offering Preparation H Advanced Gel to fellow hemorrhoid sufferer Taran Killam, but later expecteds some sort of friendship from Killam in return, even if it means humiliating him in front of his fellow dinner guests (&quot;Hey man, did that stuff I gave you help your butt?&quot;).
* President Barbie — The latest addition to the Barbie doll line, complete with sunglasses, smart phone, and a presidential seal-adorned podium. Much to Mattel&#x27;s chagrin, however, girls feel ambivalent about it (&quot;Feels like she&#x27;s trying too hard,&quot; says one). A May 2016 commentary on, as &quot;HuffPost&quot; puts it, &quot;a generation so progressive that the president&#x27;s gender is irrelevant.&quot;
* Press Conference Play Set — For kids who find watching TV press conferences boring but want to get in on the act (or need to if they must discuss broken windows or not finishing their dinner), there&#x27;s this play set that features a podium, microphone, background curtain, and other things that make a press conference a press conference.
* &quot;Prince Charles Tells You How to Pick Up Girls!&quot; — The Prince of Wales (episode host Eric Idle) plugs his book that offers men Royal-related conversation openers and techniques designed to attract the opposite sex.
* Privolin — Angela (episode host Jennifer Aniston) constantly breaks the fourth wall at a business meeting (much to her colleagues&#x27; disgust) to tell viewers about this prescription medication that treats her genital herpes.
* Pug Wigs — Sonja and Damien Regulanté (Cecily Strong and episode host Jonah Hill) promote their specialty wig store where, with just the right kind of new hair style, any pug can look more refined and handsome. Also promoted is Dana Simpson&#x27;s (Kenan Thompson) Boy Pug Beard &amp; Goatee Salon.
* &quot;Punk&#x27;d: Barely Legal&quot; — Ashton Kutcher (episode host Justin Timberlake) releases a DVD of his &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; pranks that were never shown on TV due to legal issues, such as Fred Durst (Jeff Richards) getting mugged, Christina Aguilera (Maya Rudolph) suffering from morning sickness after Kutcher steals her birth control pills, and 50 Cent (Finesse Mitchell) shooting Dax Shepard (Will Forte) dressed as a vampire (which, to Kutcher, is a &quot;double punk&quot; because Dax didn&#x27;t know he was going to get shot and 50 Cent didn&#x27;t know the vampire was Dax).
* Puppy Uppers and Doggie Downers – Gilda Radner complains to Laraine Newman that her dog Sparky has no energy, so Newman recommends Puppy Uppers. Later, when the dog is hyperactive (and quite a bit smaller), Radner complains that &quot;Sparky&#x27;s perked up a little too much&quot;, so Newman recommends dosing him with Doggie Downers.

== Q ==
* Quarry — Jane Curtin appears in this sketch about &quot;the only [breakfast] cereal that&#x27;s pure 100% rocks and pebbles&quot;, parodying the glut of &quot;natural&quot;, earthy, and crunchy (deafeningly, in this case) granola-based cereals popular in the mid-1970s. The tag line: &quot;Better tasting, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s mined&quot;.
* &quot;The Quotable Caddyshack&quot; — Episode host Bill Murray, with a cameo assist from fellow &quot;Caddyshack&quot; star Chevy Chase, promotes a leather-bound version of the frequently quoted film&#x27;s script, suitable for reference in everyday life (e.g. job interviews, wedding vows).

== R ==
* Racists for Trump — Airing in March 2016 during the heat of the Republican Party presidential primaries, this campaign ad features a cross section of &quot;real Americans&quot; expressing why they support candidate Donald Trump, from his being &quot;a winner&quot; and &quot;authentic&quot; to being &quot;the only [candidate] who&#x27;s actually created jobs.&quot; Only later are these voters revealed, without subtlety, to be Islamophobes, white supremacists, book burners, and outright Klansmen and Nazi sympathizers.
* RAD 3000 — Pitchman Spencer Mason (Chris Parnell) and NYFD officer Peter Venelli (Fred Armisen) promote this fire detector that can potentially save your life &quot;and&quot; gets you moving to hit music of the 1980s. Also featured are Dr. Dre and Ed Lover (Kenan Thompson and Finesse Mitchell) promoting the Yo! Fire Alarm Raps (&quot;If you hear this &quot;[opening beats of &quot;Bust a Move&quot; play]&quot;, be sure to bust a move outta yo house!&quot;).
* &quot;The Raunchiest Miss Rita&quot; — A promo for a spinoff of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; finds Midge Maisel (episode host and &quot;Marvelous&quot; star Rachel Brosnahan) inspiring club housekeeper Rita Mae Johnson (Leslie Jones) to try standup comedy; Rita and her very-blue material become a spotlight-stealing hit.

* Rectrix — A &quot;unique all-natural, fast-acting erectile dysfunction remedy&quot; men can insert up their rectum.
* Red Flag Perfume — an ad promoting a Chanel fragrance for women whose behavior and life choices belie their elegant appearance. Jon Hamm is the narrator; Kristen Wiig portrays the woman who has, among other things, lived in Las Vegas for 11 years and previously dated a club promoter.
* The Regal Promenade Pavilion — A venue that &quot;makes your wedding look like a wedding,&quot; featuring everything from exquisite decorations and elegant flatware to running-and-screaming 8-year-olds and stray balloons stuck in the air vent.
* Rick&#x27;s Model Ts — A &quot;promotional film&quot; for the very first used car lot. Rick (Mike O&#x27;Brien) claims to be crazy for selling cars at such low prices, but wife Daisy (episode host Tina Fey) is clearly certifiably so (&quot;I smashed a mirror &#x27;cause I saw a woman in there who&#x27;s crazy&quot;).
* Roach-Ex Plus — Cockroaches don&#x27;t stand a chance against this bug killer, especially in the hands of a jealous husband who uses it on a roach (episode host Don Cheadle) who had sex with his wife.
* Rock Bottom Kings — &quot;However your (problem gambler) friend bottoms out, make sure you cash out&quot; with this sports betting app that offers prop bets on how they&#x27;ll lose it all (e.g. betting his child&#x27;s college fund on the coin toss, caught faking his own death when he uses his phone to gamble).
* Romano Tours — Joe Romano (episode host Adam Sandler) promises beautiful tours of Italy but can&#x27;t promise the vacationer will improve personally (&quot;If you&#x27;re sad now, you might still feel sad there, okay?&quot;).
* Ron and Donna Lacatza&#x27;s Formal Emporium — Ron and Donna (Pete Davidson and Sarah Sherman) offer everything your daughter needs for her big winter formal, from elegant dresses to corsets &quot;straight from the garden&quot;… and, if parents are worried about their daughter engaging in after-party sexual intercourse, their dweeb son Donovan (Andrew Dismukes) as a date (&quot;because Donovan wouldn&#x27;t know when to start&quot;).
* Rosé Zone — Analogous to NFL RedZone, this channel features only the trashiest moments from all of reality television, so you don&#x27;t have to sit through the not-so-raunchy parts (&quot;It&#x27;s blood lust for women&quot;).
* Rosetta Stone — Users praise the CALL service in this 2013 ad, among them men who&#x27;ve picked up such Thai language phrases as “How much?” “Is that for the whole night?” and “Oh my God, what have I done?” The obvious allusions to Thailand&#x27;s prostitution trade prompted an attempt by the country&#x27;s culture minister to have the spoof removed from YouTube.
* Royal Deluxe II — This 1977 car commercial parody demonstrates the smoothness of the car&#x27;s ride by having a mohel perform a circumcision in the back seat while the car is driven at 40 MPH down a bumpy road.
* Rubik&#x27;s Grenade — A parody of Rubik&#x27;s Cube promotes what may be &quot;the last puzzle you&#x27;ll never solve&quot;.
* Russell &amp; Tate Law Firm — This parody of ads for &quot;ambulance-chasing&quot; attorneys promote a law firm whose partners are two intimidating black men with extensive &quot;resumés&quot; who repeatedly pledge to &quot;git yo&#x27; money&quot;.
* Russell Stover Black History Heart-Shaped Box — Valentine&#x27;s Day coincides with Black History Month, making February the perfect time for white men to show their Black girlfriends that they both love them &quot;and&quot; honor their culture through this set of candies molded in the visages of noted black figures (and Bill Clinton).

== S ==
* Safelite — In this Season 43 parody of testimonials for the auto glass repair company, Safelite glass repair technician Ken (played by Beck Bennett) makes repeated visits to a mother and daughter (Aidy Bryant and Melissa Villaseñor, respectively) to repair their minivan windshield. But it&#x27;s discovered that Ken&#x27;s been smashing the windshield each time, an obsession that leaves Mom infuriated. It also raised the real-life ire of Safelite, who called out the ad for bad taste on Twitter the next day (&quot;Our techs are our heroes. #notcool&quot;). The ad aired on &quot;SNL&quot; only once, the episode of October 7, 2017. By the time the episode was rerun on NBC the next month, the ad was pulled completely, replaced in the full-length on-air and online episode replays by another filmed segment (a rap video featuring Bennett, Kyle Mooney, and episode host Gal Gadot called &quot;The Last Fry&quot;) that had been &quot;cut for time&quot; from the original broadcast.
* Salon — &quot;Flamboyant&quot; beauty salon operator David Spade pitches this hairspray that&#x27;s activated by saying &quot;salon&quot; repeatedly (in the exaggerated French manner, with a sibilant &#x27;S&#x27; and the accent on the first syllable). He teaches Victoria Jackson how to say it &quot;properly&quot;.
* Samuel Adams Jack-O Pumpkin Ale — &quot;Real Bostonians&quot; sample this autumnal version of the popular Boston-brewed beer. Most of them enjoy it… except for &quot;Sean S.&quot; (episode host Bill Burr), who thinks it tastes disgusting but isn&#x27;t above having more generous samples (&quot;It&#x27;s kinda sweet n&#x27; [expletive], but, you know, if there&#x27;s nothin&#x27; else to drink…&quot;).
* Santi-Wrap — Rather than placing toilet tissue on Santa Claus&#x27; lap (as Laraine Newman initially does here), Dan Aykroyd recommends this &quot;colorful, decorative and hygienic way to protect yourself&quot; from germs part-time mall Santas carry, especially the jolly ol&#x27; elf in this setting (depicted by John Belushi as a liquor-swilling vagrant).
* &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; compilation videos — Broadway Video&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; compilations get the self-parody treatment in two ads from the 24th season&#x27;s first two episodes:
**&quot;The Best of the First 20 Minutes of Saturday Night Live&quot;, which posits that the best moments of any 90-minute &quot;SNL&quot; episode come from its first 20, specifically those from the Cameron Diaz-hosted season premiere on which this ad aired.
**&quot;The Best of Horatio Sanz&quot;, which, since Sanz had joined the cast only a week earlier, is limited in content (e.g. walk-ons, goodnights) and has old skits from a Dan Aykroyd compilation as filler.
* Schmitt&#x27;s Gay — in this spoof of beer companies&#x27; targeting of specific demographics, two housesitters (Chris Farley &amp; Adam Sandler) are discouraged at the filthy condition of the backyard pool. When the water is turned on, however, it magically transforms into a sparkling clean pool filled with attractive, and presumably gay, men wearing bikini swim trunks, whom the housesitters merrily cavort with.
* Scrotox — A Botox-like male enhancement medication that is shot directly into the scrotum. As pitchman (and episode host) Alec Baldwin puts it, &quot;Aren&#x27;t you ready for your prunes to turn into plums?&quot;
* Settl — As its name implies, this mobile dating app is aimed at women willing to settle for dates and relationships with, as user Sasheer Zamata puts it, &quot;normal guys with characteristics I am now willing to overlook.&quot;
* Shake Weight Infomercial DVD — A DVD of what &quot;Salon&quot; called &quot;TV&#x27;s dirtiest ad&quot; running &quot;three times on a loop,&quot; and is disguised &quot;in a variety of fake covers to keep your wife away.&quot;
* &quot;She&#x27;s Got a D!%k&quot; — A trailer for a romantic comedy film starring episode host Justin Timberlake, who falls for a woman (played by Nasim Pedrad) who just happens to have a little extra plumbing downstairs.
* Shimmer — Married couple Gilda Radner and Dan Aykroyd argue over what this product is — she thinks it&#x27;s a floor wax, he insists &quot;It&#x27;s a dessert topping, YOU COW!&quot; Peacemaking Chevy Chase steps in and demonstrates that &quot;new Shimmer is both a floor wax &quot;and&quot; a dessert topping!&quot;
* Shirt in a Can — Tim Meadows gets upset after spilling blueberry cobbler on his dress shirt before a job interview (&quot;DAMMIT!&quot;). Fortunately there&#x27;s this product he sprays on his person… even though it burns his skin and on-screen disclaimers include &quot;not for prolonged contact&quot; and &quot;not for use on genital areas.&quot;
* Short &amp; Curly — The shampoo men use to keep their pubic hairs clean and shiny. Also promoted is Short, Dark, Curly, and Lovely, &quot;but that, my friends, is strictly for the brothers&quot;.
* Skechers — On the week Kanye West was denied entry into its headquarters, Skechers employees state the footwear company&#x27;s &quot;zero tolerance against antisemitism,&quot; remarks of which the rapper and business mogul has expressed (which caused Adidas to sever its collaboration with West). At the same time, though, they find it pretty cool that West even considered working with Skechers. But when one employee (played by Bowen Yang) opines &quot;I&#x27;m sure Kanye will find a morally dubious company to work with instead,” the ad cuts to My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell (James Austin Johnson), a promoter of debunked COVID-19 treatments and election fraud claims, announcing his own company&#x27;s new tie-in with West.
* Sleepy Boy 2000 — Tim Kazurinsky purchases this do-it-yourself kit that, when assembled, creates a weapon that detects and destroys cars whose alarms go off in the middle of the night, enabling him to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.
* Sofa King — This furniture store ad features a family of apparent Middle Eastern origins and thick accents who promote their inventory with the adjective &quot;Sofa King&quot; (as in, &quot;It&#x27;s Sofa King comfortable!&quot;), but the term audibly comes across as if &quot;so fucking&quot; is said.
* &quot;The Sopranos Diaries&quot; — After adapting &quot;Sex and the City&quot; prequel &quot;The Carrie Diaries&quot; into a TV series, The CW does the same with &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, projecting Tony (Bobby Moynihan) and his &quot;family&quot; as high school students in the early 1980s, rad outfits and all.
* Southwest Airlines — One month after cancelling over 15,000 flights nationwide (a December 2022 crisis blamed mostly on its antiquated scheduling systems), Southwest seeks to make amends with new technology (&quot;upgrading&quot; to 2008 Dell computers), more employees (they all used to work at Waffle House), and better conveniences (new lounges inside &quot;any active Starbucks&quot;). But the onus is still on passengers, in particular a new baggage system that sorts luggage destinations by color (blue to Charlotte, red to Dallas). As air concierge Heidi Gardner reminds customers, &quot;&quot;You&quot; bought a Southwest ticket. You obviously don&#x27;t respect yourself, so why should we?&quot;
* &quot;Space Mistakes&quot; — Promoted as being on par with other cinematic space epics such as &quot;Gravity&quot; and &quot;The Martian&quot;, this film dramatically depicts what happens when astronauts makes rather innocuous mistakes in space (e.g. cracked helmets, unfastened seat belts at launch).
* Speed — Veteran &quot;SNL&quot; writer Anne Beatts makes a rare on-screen appearance as a housewife able to happily multi-task, thanks to a diet pill you don&#x27;t have to be overweight to use. Obtainable from your doctor, your neighbor&#x27;s doctor, your college roommate&#x27;s doctor, etc.
* Spirit Halloween — When communities face financial and economic hardship, the seasonal costume retailer is there to fill empty store spaces and provide jobs to the unemployed… for 6 weeks anyway.
* Spitzer and Associates — Following his resignation as Governor of New York, after his money laundering and dalliances with high-priced call girls were revealed in a criminal investigation, Eliot Spitzer (Bill Hader) promotes his private legal practice that deals with embarrassing sex-related issues. A cold-open sketch from Season 33.
* Spotlightz Acting Camp for Serious Kids — Two ads from Season 39 promote a camp where still-very-bright-eyed child actors can hone their talents by recreating adult-oriented film and TV work (e.g. &quot;Training Day&quot;, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;).
* Sproingo — This erectile dysfunction treatment works in concert with the male body by making &quot;a sensuous, audible tone&quot; (i.e. a cartoonish spring sound effect) at the onset of erection.
* Spud Beer — &quot;Filled with the full, rich flavor of potatoes&quot;, this beer is &quot;brewed for people who can&#x27;t taste the difference&quot;, in this case an electroshock subject (writer Alan Zweibel). The end tagline: &quot;Spud! The beer that made Boise famous!&quot;
* &quot;A Stab at Love&quot; — Hallmark Channel (&quot;where &#x27;boo!&#x27; means &#x27;boyfriend&#x27;&quot;) presents &quot;a horror film for the whole family&quot; that finds New York writer Kelsey (Chloe Fineman) returning to her home town of Autumn Hollow and meeting cute with an old classmate (episode host Nate Bargatze) who&#x27;s also, admittedly and openly, a serial killer.
*St. Andrew&#x27;s Center for Shivering Girls — For just $1 a day, you can provide &quot;giant, broken-in men&#x27;s sweatshirts for single girls [aged 18-29] who get cold easy&quot; and have no boyfriend they can borrow from. Featuring Heidi Gardner, Ego Nwodim, and episode host Megan Thee Stallion, this Season 48 send-up spoofs charitable organizations that serve the poor, homeless, and others in dire need of basic necessities.
* Stanx — From the makers of Spanx comes this undergarment that, rather than let embarrassing flatulence pass out of the body (as normal underwear would do), traps it inside the lining… even though the gas buildup creates an abnormally big bulge around the buttocks.
* Starbucks Verismo Home Brewing System — This parody of Starbucks&#x27; single-serve coffee maker recreates the experience of ordering at Starbucks, including getting the &quot;order&quot; wrong (it brews tea when you wanted latte), misspelling the name on the mug (&quot;Amorfa&quot; instead of &quot;Martha&quot;), and leaving broken stir sticks and sugar packs on the counter. The January 2013 ad, in its spoofing of Starbucks&#x27; baristas, generated calls of racism and classism in its depictions of both Verismo and Verquonica, the latter &quot;a larger non-functioning machine&quot; that only talks smack with Verismo about the user.
* &quot;Star Trek: Ego Quest&quot; — Paramount+ promotes an upcoming addition to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, a series that follows the voyages of the &quot;S.S. New Shepard&quot;; it&#x27;s cowboy-hatted captain, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (episode host Owen Wilson); and a &quot;crew of random weirdos&quot; making contact with the likes of Virgin Galactic&#x27;s Richard Branson (Alex Moffat) and SpaceX&#x27;s Elon Musk (Mikey Day).
* &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; — &quot;There is an alliance of heroes: the new… and the old.&quot; So says the start of this advance teaser for the film from Season 40 that emphasizes the &quot;old&quot; part of that equation (e.g. Han Solo losing his hearing, Luke Skywalker using a lightsaber walker, handicapped plates on the &quot;Millenium Falcon&quot;).
* &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; Toys &amp; Action Figures — Toys based on the film that are &quot;great for everyone ages 6 and up — &quot;way&quot; up&quot; (i.e. adult-age sci-fi geeks).
* State Farm Insurance — This Season 48 parody of the &quot;Jake from State Farm&quot; ad campaign finds Jake (played here by episode host Michael B. Jordan) helping a couple (Mikey Day and Heidi Gardner) with their insurance needs. But Jake&#x27;s playful bond with the wife and kids frightens the husband to the point that he looks online for better rates from GEICO and almost jumps off a bridge in a drunken stupor (only to be rescued by Doug and LiMu Emu from Liberty Mutual).
* Steve Martin&#x27;s All-Natural Penis Beauty Cream (New Formula) — a parody of the celebrity infomercial boom.
* Stevie Nicks Fajita Roundup — This October 1998 ad finds the singer (episode host Lucy Lawless) reworking Fleetwood Mac tunes (e.g. &quot;Rhiannon,&quot; &quot;Dreams&quot;) to promote her new Mexican restaurant in Sedona, Arizona.
* Straight Male Friend — For gay men seeking friendships other than those with overly dramatic straight women, &quot;low-effort, low-stakes&quot; friendships with straight men (as Bowen Yang exhibits here with episode host Travis Kelce) require no emotional commitment or financial investment… and apart from occasional video game-related outbursts, results in no drama. A Season 48 spoof of pharmaceutical ads (&quot;available everywhere except therapy&quot;).
* Stunt Performers Association of America — This PSA from Season 46 finds a pentet of motion picture stunt performers recreating action moves from the safety of home, while encouraging fans to also take precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group includes a trio of action stunt artists (Mikey Day, Ego Nwodim, and Chris Redd), and two stunt performers (Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon) whose forte is slapstick comedy in children&#x27;s movies.
* Sub Shack — a parody of the Subway ad campaign that featured Jared Fogle, with customers of the fast-food restaurant gaining weight rather than losing it.
* &quot;The Sunday National Enquirer&quot; — The supermarket tabloid markets to those who want to spend their Sundays reading celebrity gossip instead of highbrow journalism in this spoof of subscription offers for &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Sunday editions.
* Super Bass-O-Matic &#x27;76 — This parody of Ronco ads features Dan Aykroyd pureeing raw bass fish in a blender, as well as Laraine Newman delivering the happy pitch line, &quot;Wow, that&#x27;s terrific bass!&quot; Akroyd and Newman would reprise the ad (for the &quot;Super Bass-O-Matic 2150&quot;) during &quot;SNL&quot;″s 40th anniversary special in 2015.
*&quot;Super Feud&quot; — &quot;When two of South America&#x27;s biggest singing stars have a feud, you&#x27;re the winner.&quot; So says announcer Don Pardo in introducing this &quot;special TV offer&quot; for a compilation album of music from Jorge Montenero (episode host Patrick Swayze) and Raul Valendez (Dana Carvey), who sing about their bitter rivalry (e.g. fan mail volume, plastic surgery claims) to the tune of &quot;Guantanamera.&quot;
* Suppressex — an anti-arousal medicine taken to prevent erections from occurring at inopportune moments.
* Swiffer Sleepers — Mom Amy Poehler uses these blanket sleeper-sized cleaning cloths to pick up dust and dirt wherever her kids crawl, roll, or jump around their house (&quot;Who says sweeping floors can&#x27;t be fun?&quot;).
* Swiftamine — A medication designed to fight bouts of vertigo caused by the realization that you enjoy Taylor Swift&#x27;s music.
* Swill — Bill Murray extols the qualities of this putrid mineral water &quot;dredged from Lake Erie&quot;, the packaging of which looks nearly identical to Perrier. A highlight is the slow pouring of Swill from the bottle, set to the refrain of Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Anticipation&quot;, a song used to promote another slow-pouring food item at the time, Heinz Ketchup.

== T ==
* Taco Town — a restaurant parody of Taco Bell, selling a new taco with layer after layer of the outer crust, finished with a Chicago-style pizza and blueberry pancake, and &quot;deep-fried to perfection&quot;. &quot;Pizza?&quot; Andy Samberg says of the product, &quot;Now that&#x27;s what I call a taco!&quot;
* Tampax Secrets — Cut for time from Phoebe Waller-Bridge&#x27;s appearance as host in Season 45, this ad shows Waller-Bridge, Aidy Bryant, and Melissa Villaseñor using these tampons that are hidden in containers made to look like less embarrassing items (dog poop, a dead mouse, etc.), all the better to not let bystanders know they have to get up and care for their period.
* Target — Two ads for the department store chain that has everything you need for Thanksgiving:
** A November 2016 ad highlights an array of food, cookware, and home decor… as well as a nice, spacious parking lot where you can sit in your car and gather your bearings if you&#x27;re meeting your family for the first time since that month&#x27;s election.
** A November 2021 ad acknowledges that hosting your family &quot;can be… a whole damn thing.&quot; For that, there are discounts on such items as Nate&#x27;s Humane Tofurkey Loaf (to satisfy your sister&#x27;s vegetarian boyfriend), Apple noise-cancelling earbuds (&quot;for when Grandpa weighs in on social issues&quot;), and various wines and beers (to get through conversations about cryptocurrency, recently deceased relatives, etc.).
* Tasty Toaster Tarts — Teenager Jason (episode host Chance the Rapper) unloads a bevy of sugary treats from the kitchen cupboard for him and his friends (Mikey Day, Heidi Gardner, and Melissa Villaseñor) to snack on after school. After Jason&#x27;s friends inquire how his strict parents allowed him to stock up on so much sweet stuff, they notice suspicious signs (e.g. bloodstains, a fridge wrapped in duct tape) that Jason may have done something rash. All is good, however, when Jason produces this Pop Tarts-like product (its tagline: &quot;Keeps Kids Happy&quot;).
* Tayster&#x27;s Choice Spermicidal Jelly — A trio of ads spoofing the Taster&#x27;s Choice campaign centered on a couple who have a slow-burning romance over the coffee. Here, a woman (episode host Sharon Stone) asks her neighbor (Dana Carvey) to borrow the spermicide being advertised.
* Teacher PSA — Sponsored by OnlyFans and timed with the end of the school year, this May 2024 PSA finds teachers (various &quot;SNL&quot; castmembers and episode host Maya Rudolph) surrendering and saying &quot;y&#x27;all won&quot; to the pupils who still don&#x27;t know how to read, pull humiliating pranks, get into fights, and have forced one teacher (played by Ego Nwodim) to create a new word: TSIDDAHN (which means &quot;Sit down!&quot;).
* Tech-Pack – At the airport, Jason Sudeikis shows harried fellow traveler Kristen Wiig a new wearable pouch system that can hold and activate one&#x27;s electronic devices (mp3 players, PDAs, cellphones, etc.) with a joystick… but also tends to scare other passengers because of its uncanny resemblance to a suicide belt. The closing tag line: &quot;You&#x27;ll be blown away.&quot;
* Teddy Bear Holding a Heart – Will Forte gives sweetheart Amy Poehler this &quot;perfect way to say &#x27;our love is eternal.&#x27;&quot; Even though it&#x27;s literally a teddy bear holding a heart (it&#x27;s still attached to the box it came in), and is available anywhere (&quot;Book stores, Hallmark&#x27;s, drug stores, Wal–Mart, 7-Eleven, I&#x27;m guessing wherever you buy milk.&quot;), Poehler accepts it and shows it off as if it were expensive jewelry. An exquisitely-lensed spoof of ads for jewelers (e.g. De Beers) and retailers who heavily promote their wears as the perfect way to show true love on Valentine&#x27;s Day.
* Teens Raising Awareness About Awful Parent Drivers (T.R.A.A.A.P.D.) — Teenager Samantha Samuels (episode host Taylor Swift) states in this PSA that while texting and driving by teens is dangerous, parents&#x27; own behaviors behind the wheel can be worse, i.e. when Mom and Dad (Kristin Wiig and Jason Sudeikis) drive while lecturing, balancing hot coffee, giving the birds-and-bees talk, etc.
* Teeny Tiny Statement Pin — Microscopic badges and buttons that express messages on political and social issues (or just vague imagery), so VIPs can make a statement while still letting their red carpet looks speak louder.
* Teeny Weenies — Ana Gasteyer, Cheri Oteri and Molly Shannon appears in this sketch about a fertility drug kit where babies are made.
* Testicules — Andy Samberg and his scent turn lots of heads in this cut-for-time fragrance ad parody from Season 39, thanks to this &quot;cologne for &#x27;down there.&#x27;&quot;
* Texxon – The petroleum conglomerate was featured twice in Season 8:
** A full-length ad touts Texxon&#x27;s philanthropic efforts, i.e. funding community centers, medical clinics, and job training programs. But the ad degenerates into thinly veiled threats that those benefits will vanish if legislative and regulatory attempts don&#x27;t go their way. &quot;Do what we say,&quot; they warn, &quot;and nobody gets hurt.&quot;
** Texxon was also sponsor of Ted Koppel&#x27;s (Joe Piscopo) coverage of the Buckwheat assassination (&quot;Life goes on, and Texxon is there&quot;). When Buckwheat&#x27;s death is announced, the Texxon tagline receives an add-on: &quot;Life goes on, and Texxon is there. Because Buckwheat would have wanted it that way.&quot;
* That&#x27;s Not Yogurt! — A spoof of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter!&quot; ads and the TCBY frozen-yogurt chain. After eating the product, a couple (Victoria Jackson and Kevin Nealon) becomes very concerned about what the mysterious product actually &quot;is&quot;, but the coy announcer refuses to tell them. &quot;From the makers of Those Aren&#x27;t Olives!&quot;
* &quot;Them Trumps&quot; — A promo for a show &quot;from the producers of &quot;Empire&quot;&quot; that ponders what would happen if Donald Trump and his family were black. Centering on President &quot;Darius Trump&quot; (Kenan Thompson), the tease finds Darius supremely confident in the face of criminal investigation and sexual scandal (“They can&#x27;t lock me up!”), but quickly capitulating to the consequences when the feds storm in (“And even though I may be black—” “Freeze, Trump! You&#x27;re under arrest!” “Yeah, that sounds about right.”).
* thirtysomething Cereal — &quot;From the makers of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Cereal&quot; comes this breakfast food made for the baby boomer/yuppie generation. It has &quot;no fat, no sugar, no salt,&quot; and is made in images of characters from the angst-laden ABC drama (&quot;I got an oat bran Elliot&quot;).
*&quot; This is U.S.&quot; — a promo for an NBC series that depicts life in the Trump administration as an emotional family drama, a la &quot;This Is Us&quot;, with characters including White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders (Aidy Bryant), presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway (Kate McKinnon) and HUD secretary Ben Carson (episode host, and &quot;This Is Us&quot; cast member, Sterling K. Brown).
* Thomas Peepers Insurance — An insurance company that keeps an eye on their clients&#x27; safety and well-being — literally, as evidenced by agent Bill Hader peeping through the windows of one client&#x27;s home (only to be caught by spotlights and police sirens).
* Tim and Meat&#x27;s One-Stop Rocky Horror Shop — Tim Curry and Meat Loaf (both appearing as themselves) are proprietors of a store with props and costumes based on and to wear and use for midnight screenings of the 1975 cult film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;.
* Timecrowave — In this infomercial spoof, inventor Gram Lampton (episode host Alec Baldwin) promotes a microwave oven that sends fully cooked food back in time to when you knew you were hungry — despite a self-evident risk of temporal paradoxes arising.
* Tiny Ass Bag — Designer purses, luggage, backpacks, and carry-on handbags that are just the right size if all you want to put in them are one AirPod, one Altoid, or secrets &quot;and that&#x27;s it!&quot;
* &quot;Tinyballs&quot; — A trailer for a film &quot;from the makers of &quot;Moneyball&quot;&quot; about a Billy Beane-like GM (Taran Killam) who, instead of using sabermetrics to build a better baseball team, relies on a suspicious-looking man (episode host Ben Stiller) to inject strength — literally, through steroids — into his inept club, unhealthy side effects notwithstanding.
* Toilet Death Ejector — This ad posits that the greatest embarrassment of senior citizens is being found dead on the toilet. As pitched by episode host John Mulaney, this mechanized device helps alleviate those fears. If the user feels they&#x27;re about to die, they can press a button on the toilet, which projects them through the air and onto their bed. The device not only flushes the toilet automatically, but also drops a book next to the user (to let those discovering their corpse believe they died wise).
* Tom Brady&#x27;s Falafel City — &quot;Sim, Sim, Saladin, folks!&quot; greets episode host Tom Brady as he promotes his restaurant in South Plainfield, New Jersey that serves only Middle Eastern cuisine (♪♫ &quot;There&#x27;s no burgers, fries or weenies/just tabbouleh and tahini&quot; ♪♫).
* Tortumatic – A device Charles Rocket demonstrates as the ultimate way to show others that you can take the pain… by getting punched repeatedly by a number of boxing gloves and slamming his hand with a mallet.
* Totino&#x27;s Pizza Rolls — a series of commercials airing over three straight Super Bowl weekends in the mid-2010s focusing on a dutiful housewife (Vanessa Bayer) serving Pizza Rolls to &quot;my hungry guys&quot; watching the big game in the living room.
**The first ad, from 2015, promotes the &quot;Totino&#x27;s Super Bowl Activity Pack,&quot; featuring games and toys specifically made &quot;for grown women ages 5 and up&quot; (e.g. puzzles, play money, miniature top) that the wife can play to keep herself occupied in the kitchen while the hubby (episode host J. K. Simmons) and the guys watch the game.
**The second ad, from 2016, starts as a straight-up Super Bowl-themed Pizza Rolls ad, complete with the &quot;hungry guys&quot; reacting to the big game in unison. But the wife discovers that the TV isn&#x27;t even on (it&#x27;s just a blank screen), and when she fearfully grabs a pair of scissors for self-defense, the guys turn around all at once, revealing icy stares with solid black eyes. The end-of-ad twist: It&#x27;s actually a promotion for the recently revived TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot;.
**The third ad, from 2017, gets really steamy: When a sister of one of the guys (played by episode host Kristen Stewart) comes into the kitchen to help, the wife finds herself attracted to the woman, and the two engage in torrid intercourse, using the Pizza Rolls on their bodies and speaking in French, thus giving real meaning when the husband asks if they&#x27;re &quot;making out&quot; in the kitchen.
* Tourism Board of Africa — This Season 46 ad positions the continent as &quot;the #1 [travel] destination for divorcees of a certain age.&quot; The live skit features background beach views of strapping, shirtless men; suggestive double entendres (&quot;The mountains, the ranges… the rhythm, the pounding&quot;); and testimonials/invitations from a trio of divorced women played by Kate McKinnon, Heidi Gardner, and episode host Adele (who breaks into giggles several times).
* Transportation Security Administration — Feeling lonely and wanting a little &quot;human interaction&quot; during the holiday season? How about going through a TSA airport security check, where you can receive a physical pat-down if you refuse full-body scanning (&quot;It&#x27;s our business to touch yours&quot;). A Season 36 parody of suggestive ads for escort services.
* Tremfalta — A medication that treats irritable bowel syndrome by slowing the digestive process, which increases the intensity of bowel movements. This is evidenced by the literal stink left by a mother (episode host Carey Mulligan) in the restroom of her son&#x27;s school music recital after taking Tremfalta, much to the disgust of janitor Kenan Thompson and principal Aidy Bryant.
* Tres Equis — Two Season 38 parodies of Dos Equis beer and its &quot;Most Interesting Man in the World&quot; campaign find &quot;The Son of the Most Interesting Man in the World&quot; (episode host Joseph Gordon-Levitt) living large (&quot;He has multiple parody Twitter accounts&quot;), impressing the ladies (&quot;He can make a woman cringe, just by entering a room&quot;), and enjoying beer that&#x27;s &quot;one equis better than my dad&#x27;s beer, because he was never there for me.&quot; It leads to a father-son spat with The Most Interesting Man himself (played by Jason Sudeikis) in the second ad.
* Tressant Suprème – Kelly Ripa spoofs the numerous hair coloring ads in which she has appeared. Here, Ripa prefers Tressant Suprème because it contains &quot;just a &quot;little&quot; bit of crack cocaine&quot;, thus explaining her well-known &quot;peppy&quot; persona.
* Trilocaine – a scalp-itch medication with extremely disturbing side effects (e.g. &quot;90% of users experience an instantaneous and horrifying sleep paralysis containing a bleak vision of mortality&quot;).
* Triopenin — Airing during the first &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, this ad promotes an arthritis medication in a bottle that&#x27;s virtually impossible to open.
* Triple-Trac Razor — When this ad was written for &quot;SNL&quot;″s first episode, men&#x27;s razors hadn&#x27;t progressed past two blades. But this three-blade razor (the first two grab the whisker, the third actually makes the cut) promises to leave men&#x27;s faces &quot;as smooth as a billiard ball.&quot; The bet here is that &quot;you&#x27;ll believe anything&quot; you see in razor ads.
* &quot;Truck You, You Truckin&#x27; Truck&quot; — An ad for a CD of &quot;42 songs all about truckin&#x27;&quot; recorded by Johnny Goblin (episode host Jake Gyllenhaal) and &quot;available only at Love&#x27;s trucks stops along I-40.&quot;
* Trump Addicts of America — Supporters of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election express clear disdain for incumbent Donald Trump (&quot;He&#x27;s historically bad for the country,&quot; says one). But they&#x27;re also concerned that if Biden wins, the next four years will feel different (i.e. less angrier) without an endless stream of bad news and worse actions from Trump and his administration. The closing tag line: &quot;You know [Trump&#x27;s] bad for you, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine life without him.&quot;
* T.T. and Mario — Two ads promoting CD collections of the rauncy yet romantic song stylings of a 1970s-era Peaches and Herb-type singing duo played by Maya Rudolph and Kenan Thompson):
** &quot;The Best of T.T. and Mario&quot; (Season 30), featuring &quot;Let Me See Them,&quot; &quot;Booty So Tight,&quot; and other songs that describe bizarre and gross sexual acts.
** &quot;Married Too Long (Booty in the Rearview)&quot; (cut for time from Season 49), which features tunes about wanting to make love at the most inopportune of times, among them &quot;An Appointment for Sex,&quot; &quot;Let&#x27;s Take a Bath Together,&quot; and &quot;Boom&quot; (noted as being from the soundtrack to &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; but actually played in theater lobbies after the film ends).
* Turlington&#x27;s Lower Back Tattoo Remover – a product that, &quot;when applied once every hour for 72 straight hours&quot;, slowly burns away unwanted lower back tattoos. &quot;That tingling means it&#x27;s working!&quot; Tagline: &quot;Because it won&#x27;t be cool forever&quot;.
* Turtle Shirt — Men&#x27;s shirts that are made from the same materials as a turtle&#x27;s shell, allowing the wearer to hide from unwanted or embarrassing situations.
* Twinings Extreme — &quot;An English athlete needs an English sports drink,&quot; hence this line of tea designed to help assure peak athletic performance. Flavors include &quot;English Breakfast XL&quot; (to refuel), &quot;Darjeeling Octane&quot; (to replenish), and &quot;Earl Grey RX&quot; (to recover and &quot;be at my best for 3 to 5 days of a cricket match&quot;). Episode host Emma Thompson is featured in this cut-for-time ad from 2019.
* Tylenol B.M. – a laxative product shown to cause you to defecate while you sleep.

== U ==
* Ultimate Fighting Championship — One weekend after Celine Dion introduced a &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; game, the singer (episode host Ariana Grande) re-works &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; to hype up the mixed martial arts series, in particular its upcoming UFC 308 event (&quot;♪♫When I hit you like this/And you hit me like that♪♫&quot;).
* Uncle Jemima&#x27;s Pure Mash Liquor — With references to Uncle Remus in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Song of the South&quot;, this subtle barb at products that perpetuate racial stereotypes finds Aunt Jemima&#x27;s husband (Tracy Morgan) promoting liquor that&#x27;s &quot;more fun than pancakes&quot; thanks to its 95% alcohol content by volume (&quot;That means you get f***ed up for less money!&quot;).
* Undercover Office Potty — Beck Bennett needs to use the bathroom but is facing a big work deadline. Luckily, he can use &quot;the only toilet that looks like a lamp, so you can go whenever you want and no one has to know.&quot; That is, until his colleagues become suspicious about multiple lamps on his desk… &quot;and&quot; notice the stench coming from them.
* Under Underground Rock Festival — A series of commercials which poke fun at the crazy promotions at alternative concerts, crazy special guests, as well as the extremes people will go to defy conformity. Done in the style of Gathering of the Juggalos infomercials.
* United Tings of Aubrey — Are you a woman who has dated, or even interacted with, Drake? Has the musician&#x27;s mention of you in one of his songs, or at least his including your name in an album interlude, left you exploited? Then join &quot;the thousands of Drake&#x27;s exes and shawties&quot; seeking legal recompense.
* United Way with Peyton Manning – Manning (as himself) appears in this 2007 spoof of self-serving philanthropic public-service ads by popular athletes. Documentary-style, Manning is shown &quot;mentoring&quot; children; what ensues is Manning physically and verbally abusing the kids during a football game (hitting kids in the back of the head with a football and sending one of them to sit in a Port-A-Let for messing up a play), and afterwards teaching his charges how to break into an SUV, exploiting a little girl to get a date with an attractive woman, showing kids a tabloid magazine featuring Angelina Jolie, drinking beer in front of them, and admitting that he would kill anyone who snitches on him.
* University of Westfield — An ad for an online college that teaches students how to avoid discussing going to an online college. As one student (portrayed by Nasim Pedrad) states, Westfield taught her &quot;that going to an Internet college is not a thing that would make people want to hire me.&quot;
* &quot;Unstoppable&quot; — A trailer spoof of the 2010 motion picture starring Denzel Washington (Jay Pharoah) and Chris Pine (Taran Killam) is peppered with humorous put-downs by the train engineer leads and use of the Chrysler Building as a form of measurement by Rosario Dawson&#x27;s (episode host Scarlett Johansson) yardmaster.
* UPS — Bill Hader appears as ad man/actor Andy Azula in this ad that makes fun of the prevalence of Azula&#x27;s ad campaign for the delivery service… as well as his hairstyle.
* Urigro — parody of male enhancement medications; a pill that gives its male users an absurdly long and strong stream of urine.
* &quot;Urkel&quot; — Just as it will be giving &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; a dramatic reboot, Peacock promotes &quot;the next 90s show about the Black experience to be given a serious, high-stakes remake&quot; — &quot;Family Matters&quot;, with lovelorn genius Steve Urkel (Chris Redd) shown as coming from a broken home (deceased father, alcoholic mother) and, after beating up another teen (&quot;Did I do that?&quot;) and threatening them with a gun (&quot;&quot;Should&quot; I do that?&quot;), receiving reassurance from Chicago cop Carl Winslow (Kenan Thompson) that his own family can provide him a positive environment (&quot;Family [expletive] matters&quot;).

== V ==
* Valtrex – An ad for an antiviral drug that treats genital herpes, an infection wife Amy Poehler was surprised to learn she had despite being in a (supposedly) faithful relationship with her husband (episode host Alec Baldwin), who insists he learned form &quot;a recent scientific study&quot; that some undetectable forms of herpes remain dormant in women for years. The closing tagline: &quot;Ask your husband if you need Valtrex. He may know more than your doctor. Doctors don&#x27;t know everything.&quot;
* Veritas Ultrasound HD – Instead of a tiny monitor, the ultrasound is displayed on a widescreen HD television. It even has options to display a football helmet on the fetus (for dads-to-be missing a Sunday football because they&#x27;re accompanying the wife to see the ultrasound).
*Verizon 4G LTE — Customer Fred Armisen is left confused by salesperson Bill Hader&#x27;s bizarre explanations of how Verizon&#x27;s high-speed data service will work on a very wide variety of smart devices.
* Virgania Horsen — Two ads from 2008 find Virgania (Kristen Wiig) offering her services to those who want to avoid long lines, rude employees, and even terrorists:
** Virgania Horsen&#x27;s Hot Air Balloon Rides — Skip the TSA line and let Virgania and her hot air balloon get you to your destination.
** Virgania Horsen&#x27;s Pony Express — You don&#x27;t need the Post Office when horse-riding Virgania says, &quot;Just give me your mail, and tell me where you want it to go!&quot;
* Voting PSAs — Two public service announcements that have encouraged people to cast ballots in upcoming elections:
** One &quot;cut for time&quot; PSA, posted online the weekend before the 2020 presidential election and in the same vein as the 2018 Democratic Party ad (see above), finds various Americans communicating trust in the electoral process, contentment in voting early… and preparing for the worst, as evidenced by the likes of Kyle Mooney buying a crossbow; Beck Bennett adding a safe door to his pantry; Heidi Gardner unsuccessfully sneaking across the border into Canada; and Kate McKinnon stealing all the contraceptives from a pharmacy. There is no specific sponsor attached (the official title is &quot;Democracy PSA&quot;), but the ad&#x27;s closing message is clear: &quot;Vote. Like, soon.&quot;
** A PSA from Season 47&#x27;s finale (&quot;paid for by Stupid People&quot;) features a wide variety of Americans who admit they&#x27;re not too bright (says Aidy Bryant, &quot;The computer screen said &#x27;prove you&#x27;re not a robot.&#x27; And I cut myself.&quot;) but know that low IQs should not hinder anyone from voting (&quot;Because &quot;stupid&quot; people vote too&quot;).

== W ==
* Wade Blasingame — You wouldn&#x27;t want a human being humping your leg or digging up your lawn, so why would you let a dog do the same? Luckily, Blasingame (Will Ferrell) — &quot;the attorney, not the ballplayer&quot; — specializes in taking dogs to court over their rambunctious behavior. Also featuring Chris Parnell as Wade&#x27;s brother/associate and the human simulating bad canine behavior in the ad&#x27;s dramatizations.
* Waterbed Warehouse — Owner Dom (episode host Martin Freeman) lets wife Janine (Aidy Bryant) be the prominent face and musical voice of &quot;Upper South Dakota&#x27;s premier waterbed distributor.&quot;
* Wells for Boys – For introspective little boys who simply long to be understood, this item from Fisher-Price&#x27;s &quot;Sensitive Boy&quot; collection provides young lads a place for reflection, contemplation and the sharing of secrets; though Dad (Bobby Moynihan) may be puzzled and other boys may not get it, Mom (episode host Emma Stone) appreciates how her son can benefit from it.
* We&#x27;re Just Friends – Short shorts for men (Jason Sudeikis and Andy Samberg) whose close friendship is often mistaken for a gay relationship.
* Where You&#x27;re Going — A Season 11 parody of beer and champagne ads (namely Michelob) marketed to the yuppie demographic. Here, Jon Lovitz, Randy Quaid, Damon Wayans, Anthony Michael Hall and others are shown enjoying the good life and their financial successes… until the ad becomes &quot;a message from Almighty God&quot; at the very end, when they&#x27;re burning in Hell for living avaricious and spiritually bankrupt lives (&quot;You&#x27;re going to burn, no doubt about it&quot;).
* &quot;White Christmas&quot; — A trailer for &quot;the first Black holiday movie for a white audience,&quot; complete with a Madea-like character (episode host Paul Rudd).
* &quot;White Men Can Trump&quot; — &quot;From Newsmax Studios and the writer of &quot;Like Mike&quot;&quot; comes this film centered on Gorodn Dwyer (episode host Shane Gillis), a loser in basketball and life, who is gifted a pair of Donald Trump-branded gold sneakers. The real-life shoes (which were released in February 2024, the same month of this parody) physically and psychologically bring out the &quot;inner Trump&quot; in Gordon: He still performs poorly on the court, at the office, and in bed, yet he can still constantly claim he&#x27;s the best to the point that others start believing his bravado.
* Wilson Countersink Flanges and Dorry Flanges – Spokesman Phil Hartman talks up these technically complex industrial supplies, with Rob Schneider and Chris Farley appearing as workmen.
* Wilson Trap Doors – Unlike other office trap doors that malfunction or not work when you want them to, &quot;patented dual-firing mechanism&quot; allows this trap to work when businessman Jon Lovitz wants to do away with unwanted colleagues, clients, or other guests to his office. The closing tag line: &quot;With Wilson, it&#x27;s outta sight.&quot;
* Wing Pit — For Super Bowl Sunday, the restaurant can deliver to your door party-size chicken wing and buffalo wing platters ranging from modestly-sized trays (one- or two-dozen count) to orders literally in the hundreds or thousands (and accompanied by equally gargantuan-sized sauce arrangements).
* Winston-McCauley Funeral Home — A mortuary service that assures &quot;care, compassion, dedication&quot;… and that their employees will never have sex with dead bodies.
* Woomba – a self-operating electronic feminine hygiene product that knows when women should use it, whether they want to or not; a parody of the Roomba automatic vacuum system.
* The Worst of &quot;Soul Train&quot; — Coughy Robinson (Bobby Moynihan) hosts this Time Life infomercial promoting a DVD collection of the least memorable acts to have performed on the long-running dance &amp; music program &quot;Soul Train&quot;.
* Wrangler Open Fly Jeans — Finally, jeans with no-fly so that your parts are always camera-ready, as pitched by Brett Favre (played by Jason Sudeikis)
* Wrangler Peekaboos — Jeans designed for men to show a little bit of butt cleavage. Will Ferrell appears in this ad cut for time from his November 2019 episode as host.

== X ==
* Xanax for Gay Summer Weddings — A new version of the anxiolytic designed for heterosexuals suffering anxiety over attending elaborate gay weddings.
* Xentrex — An ad for &quot;the strongest male enhancement drug on the market,&quot; despite its dangerous ingredients, serious side effects, and the strong urging of doctors &quot;not&quot; to take it (as episode host Dwayne Johnson recounts in this ad).
* XIEMU — &quot;Fast fashion from China&quot; for less. How so cheap? &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it,&quot; the voiceover insists, because it&#x27;s not made by forced labor, only by &quot;happy [and paid] workers&quot; who do &quot;quality craftsmanship&quot; (even as the clothes fall apart on the models).

== Y ==
* Yard-a-Pult — This product allows you to launch unwanted trash, deceased pets, etc. over your fence rather than going to the time and expense of disposing of them properly.
* Your Hometown Board of Tourism — Why spend the holidays in someplace exotic like Hawai&#x27;i when this 2012 ad reminds you that your hometown is a more affordable destination. There&#x27;s the &quot;four-star accommodations of your childhood home,&quot; activities such as cleaning out your parents&#x27; garage, and exotic attractions such as your old high school.
* Your House — Looking to get away but can&#x27;t go anywhere during the COVID-19 pandemic?

* &quot;You&#x27;re a Rat Bastard, Charlie Brown&quot; — Seeking live holiday entertainment that&#x27;s family-oriented yet also edgy? The New York Actors Studio offers this gritty take on &quot;Peanuts&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Brown by way of Brooklyn.&quot; The cast features Al Pacino (Bill Hader) as the title character, Larry David (episode host Martin Short) as Linus, and Edie Falco (Kate McKinnon) as a prescription-packing Lucy.
* Yum Bubble Genital Herpes Gum — A fruit-flavored bubble gum that controls genital herpes.

*Zillow — Wanna spice up &quot;playtime&quot;? Browsing listings on the real estate website can be your next sexual fantasy… which ends once you click on &quot;Contact Agent&quot; and a nasally-voiced RE/MAX rep (Cecily Strong) wants to schedule a tour. A sensually-filmed ad from Season 46.
*Z-Shirt — Its name sums up what the product is: A 1990s hip-hop-style neon shirt with a &quot;Z&quot; on the front. As shirt-wearer Tim Robinson exclaims, &quot;This ain&#x27;t no t-shirt, it&#x27;s a &quot;Z&quot;-Shirt!&quot; The comedy comes when his buddy (episode host Kevin Hart) goes through the alphabet and asks, &quot;Oh! Wait! I&#x27;m confused! Is that an &quot;A&quot;-Shirt?&quot; &quot;Is it a &quot;B&quot;-Shirt?&quot; etc.

<text>William Ware Theiss (; November 20, 1931 – December 15, 1992) was an American costume designer for television and film.

His film credits as costume designer include &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (uncredited), &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot;, &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot;, &quot;The Man with One Red Shoe&quot;, and &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;. His television credits include &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award for Best Costume Design.

In the course of his career, Theiss was most famous for creating alluring female costuming that censors typically could not credibly forbid, employing what came to be called the &quot;Theiss Titillation Theory&quot;: &quot;The sexiness of an outfit is directly proportional to the perceived possibility that a vital piece of it might fall off.&quot;

==Early life==
Theiss was born in Medford, Massachusetts, the son of Harold Hetherington Theiss and Helen Theiss, and was named for his paternal great-grandfather, William Hodgson, and his paternal great-grandmother&#x27;s family, Ellen (Ware) Hodgson. He attended Lowell High School in San Francisco. He attended Art Center College of Design at Stanford University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts, minoring in sciences, biology and chemistry before a four-year stint in the United States Navy. He eventually moved to Los Angeles. His first Hollywood job was as a personal secretary to Cary Grant, whose ex-wife, actress Dyan Cannon, Theiss cited as having considerable influence on his career.

==Illness and death==
Theiss died of complications from AIDS on December 15, 1992, age 61.

==Career==
Following six months at Revue/Universal Studios as an apprentice artist in the Advertising Art Department, Theiss worked at CBS in the Wardrobe Department on two televised soap operas. The film &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963) was his first as a designer, although he is credited as &quot;wardrobe consultant&quot;. He returned to television as a wardrobe man for shows including &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;, and &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In the fall of 1964, he was costume designer for &quot;The World of Ray Bradbury&quot; on stage.
In 1964, he was brought to the attention of Gene Roddenberry by his friend D. C. Fontana. Roddenberry then hired Theiss as costume designer for &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The &quot;Theiss Titillation Theory&quot;—which claims that &quot;the degree to which a costume is considered sexy is directly proportional to how accident-prone it appears to be&quot;—is named after him. A key example of this idea in practice is the female android costume in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot; in which the revealing top portion consists only of two crossing straps of material that connect in one piece to trousers, and—Theiss&#x27;s personal favorite—the pink gown featured in the episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;: a backless dress in which the front of the dress was held up by the weight of the train which fell over the shoulder to the floor.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, he designed costumes for at least a dozen TV movies, including &quot;Genesis II&quot; and &quot;The B.R.A.T. Patrol&quot;, as well as for over a dozen motion pictures, including three Academy Award for Best Costume Design nominations for 1976&#x27;s &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot;, and 1983&#x27;s &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;. His final credit was as costume designer for &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, for which he won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series for the episode &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot;.

<text>Simeon Bavier (16 September 1825 in Chur – 27 January 1896 in Basel) was a Swiss politician, member of the Swiss Federal Council (1878–1883).

Bavier was trained as an underground construction engineer at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the University of Stuttgart from 1841 until 1844, and was instrumental in building some of the alpine roads in Grisons. After 1853, he focused on building railway lines both in Switzerland and abroad. Coming from a family that was involved in the transport business, he was a staunch proponent of the &quot;Ostalpenbahn&quot;, a transalpine railway connection through Grisons and over the Lukmanier Pass, which would have fundamentally changed the economic situation of Grisons.

From 1863 until 1878, he represented both the liberals of Grisons in the Swiss National Council. When he began to support the federal subsidies for the Gotthard railway, his image improved and he was seen less as a one-sided &quot;Ostalpenbahn&quot; supporter.

He was elected to the national government, the Swiss Federal Council, on 10 December 1878 and resigned on 5 January 1883. He was affiliated with the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland. During his time in office he held the following departments:
* Department of Finance (1879)
* Department of Posts and Railways (1880–1881)
* Political Department (1882) as President of the Confederation

He was President of the Confederation in 1882.

<doc id="240694" wikidata="Q712620" url="?curid=240694" title="Ronald Graham">
<text>Ronald Lewis Graham (October 31, 1935July 6, 2020) was an American mathematician credited by the American Mathematical Society as &quot;one of the principal architects of the rapid development worldwide of discrete mathematics in recent years&quot;. He was president of both the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America, and his honors included the Leroy P. Steele Prize for lifetime achievement and election to the National Academy of Sciences.

After graduate study at the University of California, Berkeley, Graham worked for many years at Bell Labs and later at the University of California, San Diego. He did important work in scheduling theory, computational geometry, Ramsey theory, and quasi-randomness, and many topics in mathematics are named after him. He published six books and about 400 papers, and had nearly 200 co-authors, including many collaborative works with his wife Fan Chung and with Paul Erdős.

Graham has been featured in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; for being not only &quot;one of the world&#x27;s foremost mathematicians&quot;, but also an accomplished trampolinist and juggler. He served as president of the International Jugglers&#x27; Association.

==Biography==
Graham was born in Taft, California, on October 31, 1935; his father was an oil field worker and later merchant marine. Despite Graham&#x27;s later interest in gymnastics, he was small and non-athletic. He grew up moving frequently between California and Georgia, skipping several grades of school in these moves, and never staying at any one school longer than a year. As a teenager, he moved to Florida with his then-divorced mother, where he went to but did not finish high school. Instead, at the age of 15, he won a Ford Foundation scholarship to the University of Chicago, where he learned gymnastics but took no mathematics courses.

After three years, when his scholarship expired, he moved to the University of California, Berkeley, officially as a student of electrical engineering but also studying number theory under D. H. Lehmer, and winning a title as California state trampoline champion. He enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1955, when he reached the age of eligibility, left Berkeley without a degree, and was stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska, where he finally completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics in 1959 at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Returning to Berkeley for graduate study, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1962. His dissertation, supervised by Lehmer, was &quot;On Finite Sums of Rational Numbers&quot;. While a graduate student, he supported himself by performing on trampoline in a circus, and married Nancy Young, an undergraduate mathematics student at Berkeley; they had two children.
After completing his doctorate, Graham went to work in 1962 at Bell Labs and later as Director of Information Sciences at AT&amp;T Labs, both in New Jersey. In 1963, at a conference in Colorado, he met the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős (1913–1996), who became a close friend and frequent research collaborator. Graham was chagrined to be beaten in ping-pong by Erdős, then already middle-aged; he returned to New Jersey determined to improve his game, and eventually became Bell Labs champion and won a state title in the game. Graham later popularized the concept of the Erdős number, a measure of distance from Erdős in the collaboration network of mathematicians; his many works with Erdős include two books of open problems and Erdős&#x27;s final posthumous paper. Graham divorced in the 1970s; in 1983 he married his Bell Labs colleague and frequent coauthor Fan Chung.

While at Bell Labs, Graham also took a position at Rutgers University as University Professor of Mathematical Sciences in 1986, and served as president of the American Mathematical Society from 1993 to 1994. He became Chief Scientist of the Labs in 1995. He retired from AT&amp;T in 1999 after 37 years of service, and moved to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), as the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Endowed Professor of Computer and Information Science. At UCSD, he also became chief scientist at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology. In 2003–04, he was president of the Mathematical Association of America.

Graham died of bronchiectasis on July 6, 2020, aged 84, in La Jolla, California.

==Contributions==
Graham made important contributions in multiple areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. He published about 400 papers, a quarter of those with Chung, and six books, including &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; with Donald Knuth and Oren Patashnik. The Erdős Number Project lists him as having nearly 200 coauthors. He was the doctoral advisor of nine students, one each at the City University of New York and Rutgers University while he was at Bell Labs, and seven at UC San Diego.

Notable topics in mathematics named after Graham include the Erdős–Graham problem on Egyptian fractions, the Graham–Rothschild theorem in the Ramsey theory of parameter words and Graham&#x27;s number derived from it, the Graham–Pollak theorem and Graham&#x27;s pebbling conjecture in graph theory, the Coffman–Graham algorithm for approximate scheduling and graph drawing, and the Graham scan algorithm for convex hulls. He also began the study of primefree sequences, the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, the biggest little polygon, and square packing in a square.

Graham was one of the contributors to the publications of G. W. Peck, a pseudonymous mathematical collaboration named for the initials of its members, with Graham as the &quot;G&quot;.

===Number theory===
Graham&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was in number theory, on Egyptian fractions, as is the Erdős–Graham problem on whether, for every partition of the integers into finitely many classes, one of these classes has a finite subclass whose reciprocals sum to one. A proof was published by Ernie Croot in 2003. Another of Graham&#x27;s papers on Egyptian fractions was published in 2015 with Steve Butler and (nearly 20 years posthumously) Erdős; it was the last of Erdős&#x27;s papers to be published, making Butler his 512th coauthor.

In a 1964 paper, Graham began the study of primefree sequences by observing that there exist sequences of numbers, defined by the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci numbers, in which none of the sequence elements is prime. The challenge of constructing more such sequences was later taken up by Donald Knuth and others. Graham&#x27;s 1980 book with Erdős, &quot;Old and new results in combinatorial number theory,&quot; provides a collection of open problems from a broad range of subareas within number theory.

===Ramsey theory===
The Graham–Rothschild theorem in Ramsey theory was published by Graham and Bruce Rothschild in 1971, and applies Ramsey theory to combinatorial cubes in combinatorics on words. Graham gave a large number as an upper bound for an instance of this theorem, now known as Graham&#x27;s number, which was listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the largest number ever used in a mathematical proof, although it has since then been surpassed by even larger numbers such as TREE(3).

Graham offered a monetary prize for solving the Boolean Pythagorean triples problem, another problem in Ramsey theory; the prize was claimed in 2016.
Graham also published two books on Ramsey theory.

===Graph theory===

The Graham–Pollak theorem, which Graham published with Henry O. Pollak in two papers in 1971 and 1972, states that if the edges of an formula_1-vertex complete graph are partitioned into complete bipartite subgraphs, then at least formula_2 subgraphs are needed. Graham and Pollak provided a simple proof using linear algebra; despite the combinatorial nature of the statement and multiple publications of alternative proofs since their work, all known proofs require linear algebra.

Soon after research in quasi-random graphs began with the work of Andrew Thomason, Graham published in 1989 a result with Chung and R. M. Wilson that has been called the &quot;fundamental theorem of quasi-random graphs&quot;, stating that many different definitions of these graphs are equivalent.

Graham&#x27;s pebbling conjecture, appearing in a 1989 paper by Chung, is an open problem on the pebbling number of Cartesian products of graphs.

===Packing, scheduling, and approximation algorithms===
Graham&#x27;s early work on job shop scheduling introduced the worst-case approximation ratio into the study of approximation algorithms, and laid the foundations for the later development of competitive analysis of online algorithms. This work was later recognized to be important also for the theory of bin packing, an area that Graham later worked in more explicitly.

The Coffman–Graham algorithm, which Graham published with Edward G. Coffman Jr. in 1972, provides an optimal algorithm for two-machine scheduling, and a guaranteed approximation algorithm for larger numbers of machines. It has also been applied in layered graph drawing.

In a survey article on scheduling algorithms published in 1979, Graham and his coauthors introduced a three-symbol notation for classifying theoretical scheduling problems according to the system of machines they are to run on, the characteristics of the tasks and resources such as requirements for synchronization or non-interruption, and the performance measure to be optimized. This classification has sometimes been called &quot;Graham notation&quot; or &quot;Graham&#x27;s notation&quot;.

===Discrete and computational geometry===

Graham scan is a widely used and practical algorithm for convex hulls of two-dimensional point sets, based on sorting the points and then inserting them into the hull in sorted order. Graham published the algorithm in 1972.

The biggest little polygon problem asks for the polygon of largest area for a given diameter. Surprisingly, as Graham observed, the answer is not always a regular polygon. Graham&#x27;s 1975 conjecture on the shape of these polygons was finally proven in 2007.

In another 1975 publication, Graham and Erdős observed that for packing unit squares into a larger square with non-integer side lengths, one can use tilted squares to leave an uncovered area that is sublinear in the side length of the larger square, unlike the obvious packing with axis-aligned squares. Klaus Roth and Bob Vaughan proved that uncovered area at least proportional to the square root of the side length may sometimes be needed; proving a tight bound on the uncovered area remains an open problem.

===Probability and statistics===
In nonparametric statistics, a 1977 paper by Persi Diaconis and Graham studied the statistical properties of Spearman&#x27;s footrule, a measure of rank correlation that compares two permutations by summing, over each item, the distance between the positions of the item in the two permutations.
They compared this measure to other rank correlation methods, resulting in the &quot;Diaconis–Graham inequalities&quot;
:formula_3
where formula_4 is Spearman&#x27;s footrule, formula_5 is the number of inversions between the two permutations (a non-normalized version of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient), and formula_6 is the minimum number of two-element swaps needed to obtain one permutation from the other.

The Chung–Diaconis–Graham random process is a random walk on the integers modulo an odd integer formula_7, in which at each step one doubles the previous number and then randomly adds zero, formula_8, or formula_9 (modulo formula_7). In a 1987 paper, Chung, Diaconis, and Graham studied the mixing time of this process, motivated by the study of pseudorandom number generators.

===Juggling===

Graham became a capable juggler beginning at age 15, and was practiced in juggling up to six balls. (Although a published photo shows him juggling twelve balls, it is a manipulated image.) He taught Steve Mills, a repeat winner of the International Jugglers&#x27; Association championships, how to juggle, and his work with Mills helped inspire Mills to develop the Mills&#x27; Mess juggling pattern. As well, Graham made significant contributions to the theory of juggling, including a sequence of publications on siteswaps. In 1972 he was elected president of the International Jugglers&#x27; Association.

==Awards and honors==
In 2003, Graham won the American Mathematical Society&#x27;s annual Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement. The prize cited his contributions to discrete mathematics, his popularization of mathematics through his talks and writing, his leadership at Bell Labs, and his service as president of the society. He was one of five inaugural winners of the George Pólya Prize of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, sharing it with fellow Ramsey theorists Klaus Leeb, Bruce Rothschild, Alfred Hales, and Robert I. Jewett. He was also one of two inaugural winners of the Euler Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications, the other being Claude Berge.

Graham was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1985. In 1999 he was inducted as an ACM Fellow &quot;for seminal contributions to the analysis of algorithms, in particular the worst-case analysis of heuristics, the theory of scheduling, and computational geometry&quot;. He became a Fellow of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009; the fellow award cited his &quot;contributions to discrete mathematics and its applications&quot;. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Graham was an invited speaker at the 1982 International Congress of Mathematicians (held 1983 in Warsaw), speaking on &quot;Recent developments in Ramsey theory&quot;. He was twice Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer, in 2001 and 2015.
The Mathematical Association of America awarded him both the Carl Allendoerfer Prize for his paper &quot;Steiner Trees on a Checkerboard&quot; with Chung and Martin Gardner in &quot;Mathematics Magazine&quot; (1989), and the Lester R. Ford Award for his paper &quot;A whirlwind tour of computational geometry&quot; with Frances Yao in the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; (1990). His book &quot;Magical Mathematics&quot; with Persi Diaconis won the Euler Book Prize.

The proceedings of the &quot;Integers 2005&quot; conference was published as a festschrift for Ron Graham&#x27;s 70th birthday. Another festschrift, stemming from a conference held in 2015 in honor of Graham&#x27;s 80th birthday, was published in 2018 as the book &quot;Connections in discrete mathematics: a celebration of the work of Ron Graham&quot;.

<text>Return to Zork is a graphic adventure game, developed by Activision, and released in 1993 for Mac, MS-DOS, PlayStation, and the Sega Saturn; plans for the game to be released on 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and Atari Jaguar were later shelved, the latter for unknown reasons. The game was the last to be published by Infocom for the &quot;Zork&quot; series, and was the first to use a point-and-click interface, rather than text-based interaction as in previous games.

The story takes place in the Great Underground Empire, several hundred years after the last &quot;Zork&quot; game, and sees players investigating a region that is slowly falling into decay thanks to a powerful demon-like entity that targets those who oppose it. The game features multiple ways to solve puzzles, as well as a variety of characters portrayed in live-action by recognizable character actors, with the cast including Sam J. Jones, Jason Hervey, and Robyn Lively.

&quot;Return to Zork&quot; proved a commercial success, with one million units sold by the end of 1995, stablizing Activision following its acquistion by a new owner. Critics praised the overall presentation and story, yet panned it for the cast&#x27;s poor acting and questionned the modernization of the &quot;Zork&quot; series it presented. The game later went on to be labelled among some of the best computers game made by the mid-1990s.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Return to Zork&quot; focuses on a point-and-click interface with detailed 3D scenes, a replacement for the text parser system used by Infocom in previous &quot;Zork&quot; games, and acted as a spiritual precursor to the interface system of &quot;Myst&quot;. Players can move around to different locations to explore them from a first-person perspective, where location has a variety of objects which can be interacted with in different ways - when selected, the game offers a variety of options for the player to chose from with that object, such as picking it up, pulling it, wearing it, and so forth. Objects that can be carried are kept in an inventory, where they can be examined, used from, or combined with other items. In addition, players carry a camera that can be used to photograph people and locations. Like other &quot;Zork&quot; games, players may encounter situations where they must avoid performing an action, or have the right items for a situation, otherwise the game will end prematurely, forcing them to reload to a previous point.

Various NPCs, represented through video-captured actors, can be found during the game. They can be conversed with, though conversations are steered by the player using different emotional reactions to the NPC, such as acting aggressive, or making pleas to them, rather than selecting verbal topics like traditional adventure games; the choice of emotional reaction impacts how the NPC will respond, such as making them provide information or grant an item. In addition to emotional responses, players can also show NPCs any photographs and items they have, with conversations with them being recorded on a tape recorder which can be replayed later on when required. Players can kill NPC characters, compared to other &quot;Zork&quot; games, but such repeated actions are punished by a masked vigilante character taking all them items, making the game unwinnable.

As with other &quot;Zork&quot; games, a score system keeps check on the player&#x27;s progress, rewarding poinits for completing specific actions.

==Plot==
===Setting===
&quot;Return to Zork&quot; is set in the fantasy world of Zork, within the year 1647 GUE, at a point where society and technology are similiar to or contemporaneous with 20th century Earth, including cameras, sound recorders, lights, computers, and vehicles, though with magic and magical creatures like trolls and dwarves still in existence. Four hundred years before the beginning of the game, in 1247 GUE, Zork experienced an event called the &quot;Great Diffusion&quot;, which impact life, but is now regarded centuries later as less historical and more a myth.

The game&#x27;s events take place in a region of what was once the Great Underground Empire, known as the Valley of Sparrows, which features a forest, swamp, ruins and mines, and the town of Shanbar.

===Story===
The game begins with Player receiving a letter from the mailbox before Zork&#x27;s iconic &quot;White House&quot;, revealing they have won the sweepstakes for an all expenses paid holiday to the Valley of Sparrows, courtesy of Rufus Rooper, owner of a travel company. As part of their prize, the Player is gifted a camera, tape recorder, and a magic orb called a &quot;Tele Orb&quot;. When Rufus contacts them to congratulate their win, something interrupts the conversation and kidnaps him. When the Player proceeds to the Valley of Sparrows, they find it a desolate place falling into ruin and decay, and infested with deadly vulutures - the region being ironically renamed &quot;Valley of Vultures&quot;. Exploring the area and making for the town of Shanbar, they find half the town is missing, and parts of what left have fallen into ruin.

Locating a magic door beneath the town&#x27;s mill, the Player discovers the other half of Shanbar, known as &quot;East Shanbar&quot;, existing in a region of the lost Underground. Conversing with the inhabitants, including fellow Zork explorer Rebecca Snoot, the Player learns that Shanbar is under threat from a mysterious being known only as Morphius. Thanks to its presences, vultures emerged in the Valley, Shanbar was separated by powerful magic, and many of the remaining inhabitant suffer frequent and disturbing nightmares, with some becoming reclusive and paranoid. Learning that Morphius must reside somewhere near to East Shanbar behind a spell of illusion, the Player works to find and reform a magical artifact that can remove the spell.

Using the artifact, the Player gains entry to Morphius stronghold, overcoming obstacles to finally battle with them, learning that their many friends they made have been turned into statues. Playing a game they learnt about in East Shanbar, the Player defeats Morphius in their match, causing the entity to destroy itself with its own power, an event that goes on to be referred to as &quot;The Second Great Diffusion&quot;. As the Valley returns to normal, the Player eventually reunites with Rufus, who asks them to teach him the game they learnt on their journey.

==Development==
In 1991, Activision was undergoing restructuring by its new president Bobby Kotick, following their purchase of the company in 1990. As part of that effort, Kotick sought to capitalize on the company&#x27;s lucrative back catalog of game licenses. Amongst these, Activision held the license for the &quot;Zork&quot; series, which Kotick believed could receive a new game, believing by 1996 that &quot;&quot;Zork&quot; on a brick would sell 100,000 copies&quot;. Development focused on modernising the game from its text-adventure phase into a more interactive point-and-click adventure game. The team was led by Doug Barnett, a noted game designer; Michele Em, a game scenario and dialogue scriptwriter; and Mark Long, an art designer (later to go on and become co-founder/owner of Zombie Studios).

Long was cheifly responsible for much of the game&#x27;s design, beliving the final product needed to become &quot;realistic&quot; in presentation alongside modern adventure games, and avoiding a return to concepts like &quot;mazes in text adventure games&quot; - which Long regard as being &quot;overdone, dull, and annoying&quot; - with puzzles that could have multiple ways of being handled in order to finish the game. In an interview in 1999, Long reasoned that the idea for this was because he &quot;didn&#x27;t like games that you had to follow a single, specific, obfuscated path for each puzzle, and just one way the game could be finished&quot;, stating the concept would provide a player with &quot;reason to play the game more than once, trying to discover new ways to solve puzzles and to finish the game.&quot; Much of the game&#x27;s year-long research relied on examination of various real-life cultures, archeological history and studies to provide cultural references for &quot;Return to Zork&quot;, aided by Long&#x27;s military experience overseas with the U.S. Army. 

As part of its story, Activision employed several recognizable character actors to portray the characters, each conducting video-recorded FMV sessions in a similar vein to other titles of the mid-1990s, such as &quot;Command and Conquer&quot;. The cast included a number of well-known younger actors: Robyn Lively of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as &quot;The Fairy&quot;, Jason Hervey of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; as &quot;The Troll King&quot;, Sam J. Jones from the 1980 film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; as &quot;The Blind Bowman&quot;, and A.J. Langer of &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; as fellow Zork explorer Rebecca Snoot.

Although finished for release, the game was not properly beata-checked, allowing for some bugs to remain in the game code. A patch was released after launch to fix the bugs, though left a bug within that reduce the number of solutions for completing the game by one.

==Release==
Roughly half a year before &quot;Return to Zork&quot;″s original release on PC, Activision announced that the game would also be released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. This version was later cancelled. Two months later after release, it was announced that Activision was working on a conversion of &quot;Return to Zork&quot; for the Atari Jaguar after they were signed by Atari Corporation to be a third-party developer for the system. The port was then announced in video game magazines in 1994 as one of the first upcoming titles for the Atari Jaguar CD add-on. It was kept being advertised as in development on magazines in 1995, however, it was never released for unknown reasons.

==Reception==

&quot;Return to Zork&quot; was made on a budget of $1.5 million, and became a commercial hit. In its first six months, the game achieved global sales of 300,000 units. By September 1994, it had earned $2.4 million and sold 600,000 copies—&quot;more than half from bundled systems&quot;, according to &quot;Fortune&quot;″s Stephanie Losee. The game shipped roughly 1 million units by October 1995. According to Jeff Sengstack of &quot;NewMedia&quot;, its success helped to revitalize Activision, which had recently been purchased by Bobby Kotick.

Charles Ardai of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote in a November 1993 preview of &quot;Return to Zork&quot; that modernizing the Zork series was &quot;treading on sacred ground. It&#x27;s a little bit like daring to remake &quot;Casablanca&quot;&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Scorpia in January 1994 criticized inconsistencies with previous Zork games and other flaws, but stated that &quot;Considered as a game without the Zork label, however, it&#x27;s not too bad&quot;, citing the &quot;pretty&quot; graphics. She suggested that Activision should have published it as a standalone game instead of &quot;trying to recycle the magic of the past&quot;, concluding &quot;A new direction is needed here, and if Activision can find it, they may yet produce adventures worthy of the Infocom label&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said that despite some poor acting, the game&#x27;s &quot;marvelous visual and sound presentation&quot; and &quot;many plot twists and engaging characters will keep most players engrossed&quot;.

&quot;Return to Zork&quot; was named the best adventure game of 1993 by &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;. It was also a runner-up for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1993 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot; and &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot; (tie). The editors wrote that it uses &quot;Hollywood talent and sophisticated techniques to up the ante of production values.&quot; In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Return to Zork&quot; as the 26th best computer game ever. The editors wrote that it &quot;masterfully ... balances the traditions of a classic gaming series with cutting-edge graphics and CD-ROM technology.&quot;

<doc id="240706" wikidata="Q268673" url="?curid=240706" title="Music of the United Kingdom">
<text>Throughout the history of the British Isles, the land that is now the United Kingdom has been a major music producer, drawing inspiration from church music and traditional folk music, using instruments from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms, which flourished until the era of industrialisation when they began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Many British musicians have influenced modern music on a global scale, and the UK has one of the world&#x27;s largest music industries. English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh folk music as well as other British styles of music heavily influenced American music such as American folk music, American march music, old-time, ragtime, blues, country, and bluegrass. The UK has birthed many popular music genres such as beat music, psychedelic music, progressive rock/pop, heavy metal, new wave, industrial music, and drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass.

In the 20th century, influences from the music of the United States, including blues, jazz, and rock and roll, were adopted in the United Kingdom. The &quot;British Invasion&quot;—spearheaded by Liverpool band the Beatles, often regarded as the most influential band of all time—saw British rock bands become highly influential around the world in the 1960s and 1970s. Pop music, a term which originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for &quot;rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced&quot;, was developed by British artists like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, whom among other British musicians led rock and roll&#x27;s transition into rock music.

==Background and classical music==

Music in the British Isles, from the earliest recorded times until the Baroque and the rise of recognisably modern classical music, was a diverse and rich culture, including sacred and secular music and ranging from the popular to the elite. Each of the major nations of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales retained unique forms of music and instrumentation, but British music was highly influenced by continental developments, while British composers made an important contribution to many of the major movements in early music in Europe, including the polyphony of the Ars Nova and laid some of the foundations of later national and international classical music. Musicians from the British Isles also developed some distinctive forms of music, including Celtic chant, the Contenance Angloise, the rota, polyphonic votive antiphons and the carol in the medieval era.

Church music and religious music were profoundly affected by the Protestant Reformation which affected Britain from the 16th century, which curtailed events associated with British music and forced the development of distinctive national music, worship and belief. English madrigals, lute ayres and masques in the Renaissance era led particularly to English language opera developed in the early Baroque period of the later seventeenth century. In contrast, court music of the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, although having unique elements remained much more integrated into wider European culture.

The Baroque era in music, between the early music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods and the development of fully fledged and formalised orchestral classical music in the second half of the eighteenth century, was characterised by more elaborate musical ornamentation, changes in musical notation, new instrumental playing techniques and the rise of new genres such as opera. Although the term Baroque is conventionally used for European music from about 1600, its full effects were not felt in Britain until after 1660, delayed by native trends and developments in music, religious and cultural differences from many European countries and the disruption to court music caused by the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and Interregnum. Under the restored Stuart monarchy the court became once again a centre of musical patronage, but royal interest in music tended to be less significant as the seventeenth century progressed, to be revived again under the House of Hanover.

British chamber and orchestral music drew inspiration from continental Europe as it developed into modern classical music. The Baroque era in British music can be seen as an interaction of national and international trends, sometimes absorbing continental fashions and practices and sometimes attempting, as in the creation of ballad opera, to produce an indigenous tradition. However, arguably the most significant British composer of the era, George Frideric Handel, was a naturalised German, who helped integrate British and continental music and define the future of the classical music of the United Kingdom that would be officially formed in 1801.

Musical composition, performance and training in the United Kingdom inherited European classical traditions of the eighteenth century (above all, in Britain, from the example of Handel) and saw a great expansion during the nineteenth century. Romantic nationalism encouraged clear national identities and sensibilities within the countries of the United Kingdom towards the end of the nineteenth century, producing many composers and musicians of note and drawing on the folk tradition. 

These traditions, including the cultural strands drawn from the United Kingdom&#x27;s constituent nations and provinces, continued to evolve in distinctive ways through the work of such composers as Arthur Sullivan, Gustav Holst, Edward Elgar, Hubert Parry, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Benjamin Britten, Michael Tippett, Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle. Notable living British classical composers include Michael Nyman, James MacMillan, Jeremy Peyton Jones, Gavin Bryars, Andrew Poppy, Judith Weir, Sally Beamish and Anna Meredith.

==Timeline of British classical music, and its preceding forms==
==Folk music==
Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms. Folk music flourished until the era of industrialisation when it began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Realisation of this led to three folk revivals, one in the late-19th century, one in the mid-20th century and one at the start of the 21st century which keeps folk music as an important sub-culture within society.

===English folk music===

England has a long and diverse history of folk music dating back at least to the medieval period and including many forms of music, song and dance. Through three periods of revival from the late nineteenth century much of the tradition has been preserved and continues to be practiced. It led to the creation of a number of fusions with other forms of music that produced subgenres such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal and continues to thrive nationally and in regional scenes, particularly in areas such as Northumbria and Cornwall.

===Gaels folk music===
====Northern Irish folk music====

Ireland, including Northern Ireland, has vibrant folk traditions. The popularity of traditional instruments such as fiddles has remained throughout the centuries even as analogues in Great Britain died out. Perhaps the most famous modern musician from Northern Ireland influenced by folk tradition is Van Morrison.

====Scottish folk music====
Scottish folk music includes many kinds of songs, including ballads and laments, sung by a single singer with accompaniment by bagpipes, fiddles or harps. Traditional dances include waltzes, reels, strathspeys and jigs. Alongside the other areas of the United Kingdom, Scotland underwent a roots revival in the 1960s. Cathy-Ann McPhee and Jeannie Robertson were the heroes of this revival, which inspired some revolutions in band formats by groups like The Clutha, The Whistlebinkies, The Boys of the Lough and the Incredible String Band.

===Welsh folk music===

Wales is a Celtic country that features folk music played at twmpathau (communal dances) and gwyl werin (music festivals). Welsh music also includes male voice choirs and songs accompanied by a harp. Having long been subordinate to English culture, Welsh musicians in the late 20th century had to reconstruct traditional music when a roots revival began. This revival began in the late 1970s and achieved some mainstream success in the UK in the 1980s with performers like Robin Huw Bowen, Moniars and Gwerinos.

==Early British popular music==

In the sense of commercial music enjoyed by the people, British popular music can be seen to originate in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the arrival of the broadside ballad, which were sold cheaply and in great numbers until the nineteenth century. Further technological, economic and social changes led to new forms of music in the 20th century, including the brass band, which produced a popular and communal form of classical music. Similarly, the music hall sprang up to cater for the entertainment of new urban societies, adapting existing forms of music to produce popular songs and acts. In the 1930s, the influence of American Jazz led to the creation of British dance bands, who provided a social and popular music that began to dominate social occasions and the radio airwaves.

==Modern British popular music==

===Pioneering and developments===
Britain has influenced popular music disproportionately to its size, due to its linguistic and cultural links with many countries, particularly the United States and many of its former colonies like Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and its capacity for invention, innovation and fusion, which has led to the development of, or participation in, many of the major trends in popular music. Forms of popular music, including folk music, jazz, rapping/hip hop, pop and rock music, have particularly flourished in Britain since the twentieth century.

In the early-20th century, influences from the United States became most dominant in popular music, with young performers producing their own versions of American music, including rock n&#x27; roll from the late 1950s and developing a parallel music scene. During the early 1960s, the British Invasion, led by the Beatles, further entrenched British performers as major drivers of the development of pop and rock music. According to the website of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, the term &quot;pop music&quot; &quot;originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced&quot;. 

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Music&quot; states that while pop&#x27;s &quot;earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA [a Swedish act], etc.&quot; Since then, rock music and popular music contributed to a British-American collaboration, with trans-Atlantic genres being exchanged and exported to one another, where they tended to be adapted and turned into new movements. 
Britain&#x27;s most significant contribution to popular music during the 20th century was towards the expansion of rock music. Progressive rock was predicated on the &quot;progressive&quot; pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. According to AllMusic, the emergence of psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s resulted from British bands who made up the British Invasion of the US market. Many of the top British bands during the 1960s experienced art school during their youth, and espoused an approach based on art and originality—which came to create art rock. 

As a diverging act to the popular pop rock of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock. Heavy metal was created by British musicians, including acts like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. Glam rock, which was developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, was performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter—this is widely associated with David Bowie. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; argued that the Sex Pistols, a prominent punk rock band, came to spark and personify one of the few truly critical moments in pop culture—the rise of punk during the 1970s. 

Music historian Vernon Joynson claimed that new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk. Gothic rock emerged from post-punk in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s by bands including Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus, and the Cure. Other subgenres of rock invented by or radically changed by British acts include blues rock, ska, British folk rock, folk punk, shoegaze, and Britpop.

===Post-rock era===
In addition to advancing the scope of rock music, British acts developed avant-funk and neo soul and created acid jazz. Whilst disco is an American form of music, British pop group Bee Gees were the most prominent performers of the disco music era in the mid-to-late 1970s, and came be to known as the &quot;Kings of Disco&quot; by media outlets. The Second British Invasion, which derived from the British Invasion of the US in the 1960s, consisted of music acts from the United Kingdom that became popular in the United States during the early-to-mid 1980s primarily due to the cable music channel MTV. 

These synthpop and new wave associated acts often featured on the American pop charts, and according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, brought &quot;revolution in sound and style&quot;. New Pop became an umbrella term used by the music industry to describe young, mostly British, androgynous, and technologically oriented artists such as Culture Club and Eurythmics. Boy George of Culture Club was a leading figure in the new romantic movement which became a major part in the Second British Invasion of the US. British rock bands, most notably Def Leppard and Iron Maiden, also became part of the renewed popularity of British music. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ran an issue which featured Scottish singer Annie Lennox of Eurythmics and Boy George on the cover of its issue with the caption &quot;Britain Rocks America – Again&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would release an &quot;England Swings: Great Britain invades America&#x27;s music and style. Again.&quot; issue in November 1983. Pop-star George Michael was one of the most popular acts of the MTV Generation, cementing this position with his hugely successful &quot;Faith&quot; album in 1987.

During most of the 1990s, Cool Britannia—a period of increased pride in the culture of the United Kingdom, inspired by the 1960s Swinging Sixties—was coined due to the success of the girl band Spice Girls and Britpop acts Blur and Oasis, which led to a renewed feeling of optimism in the United Kingdom following the pessimistic tone of the 1970s and 1980s. The electronic subgenres trip hop, dubstep, and industrial originated in Britain during the 1990s. During the 21st century, blue-eyed soul came to be dominated by British singers, including Amy Winehouse, Duffy and most notably Adele, who has broken several sales and chart records. Adele has won more Grammy Awards than any other woman who was born outside the US. This wave of popular British soul singers led to a consideration of whether a third British Invasion was taking place—this time a &quot;soul invasion&quot;—in contrast to the 1960s rock and pop, and 1980s new wave and synthpop invasions. 

English singer Ed Sheeran was the foremost folk-orientated artist of the 2010s; the Official Charts Company named him artist of the decade, with the most combined success in the UK album and singles charts in the 2010s. Globally, Spotify named Sheeran the second most streamed artist of the decade. London formed English-Irish pop boy band One Direction were one of the biggest teen idols of the 2010s. Little Mix, a pop girl group and the winner of the eight series of the British version of The X Factor, established themselves as the UK&#x27;s biggest girl group and one of the best-selling girl groups in the world.

===Immigration musical impact===
Highlighting the influence of immigrants in the United Kingdom during the 21st century, British African-Caribbean people created grime, Afrobeats, and afroswing. Grime has been described as the &quot;most significant musical development within the UK for decades.&quot; In addition, British Asians have popularised Bhangra within the South Asian diaspora.

<doc id="240709" wikidata="Q6980172" url="?curid=240709" title="Nato.0+55+3d">
<text>NATO.0+55+3d was a software application for realtime video and graphics, released by 0f0003 Maschinenkunst and the Netochka Nezvanova collective in 1999 for the classic Mac OS operating system.

Being one of the earliest applications to allow realtime video manipulation and display, it was used by artists for a large variety of purposes, prominently for live performance, VJing and interactive installation.

==Design==
Running in the framework of Max (a visual programming interface for rapid prototyping and developing of audio software), NATO.0+55+3d extended Max by allowing to access and manipulate all the media types that QuickTime supports (films, images, 3D models, QuickTime VR, etc.). The functionalities included image generation, image processing, control over MIDI and numerical data, integration with Internet, 3D, text and sound.

==History==
At the time of its release (the summer of 1999), NATO.0+55+3d was in demand as it appeared several years before other similar infrastructures such as GEM and Jitter (released by the makers of Max/MSP in October 2002). Earlier software such as Image/ine developed in 1997 at STEIM was drawing in a similar direction, but the fact that NATO.0+55+3d was operating inside the Max/MSP framework, using its &quot;visual programming&quot; protocol, provided at the same time greater ease of use and more flexibility, allowing the user to create their own applications and tools. It gained popularity among video artists and performers, who were using it for a large variety of purposes, prominently for live performance and interactive installation.

The last version of NATO.0+55+3d modular was released in November 2000, while additional NATO objects were developed until June 2001.

=== Version history ===
==Applications==
Artists used the software to &quot;manipulate video for live performance and installations&quot; (Mieszkowski 2002). The flexibility of the interface provided artists with &quot;a uniquely suitable environment for the creation of new synesthesiac applications and experiences&quot; (Meta 2001) and &quot;opened up tremendous possibillities for working with realtime video&quot; (Gilje 2005).

As NATO was distributed with a software development kit, several artists and programmers created third party extensions (e.g. the &quot;PeRColate&quot; and &quot;Auvi&quot; object libraries), or developed entire applications based on NATO.

===NATO.0+55 pilots===
Some of the most prominent users of NATO.0+55:

* 242.pilots (Kurt Ralske, HC Gilje, Lukasz Lysakowski) – live video improvisation ensemble, winners of the Transmediale award 2003 in the category &quot;Image&quot; for their video performance DVD &quot;Live In Bruxelles&quot;, released on the Carpark imprint in November 2002. 
* Farmers Manual – the Austrian collective was among the first artists to integrate NATO visuals into their performances. Their twelve-hour performance &quot;Help Us Stay Alive&quot;, which was presented and awarded at FCMM festival in Montreal, October 1999, was using the NATO software. The group held a max/nato/pd workshop at Avanto festival in 2001.
* fiftyfifty.org – media art collective based in Barcelona. Its members Pedro Soler and Mia Makela (aka SOLU) were very active promoters of NATO, organizing numerous workshops and using the software in live performance. 
* Johnny Dekam – founder of VIDVOX. Used NATO to create &#x27;Revision History&#x27;, an artistic software that autonomously downloads and transforms images from the Library of Congress&#x27; Database. His commercial VJing software VDMX (released in 2001) was originally based on NATO.0+55. 
* The Builders Association – American multimedia theater company. Used NATO for their piece &quot;Xtravaganza&quot;, performed in 2000 at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the New York Guggenheim Museum. During the piece, &quot;live actors [were] keyed into old movie footage&quot;. 
* – Japanese audiovisual duo (Jun Horikiri and Taeji Sawai). Made extensive use of NATO.0+55 in their video installations and live shows, at locations including ISEA, sónar and ICC Tokyo. Gave a NATO workshop at Kyushu Institute of Design in 2001. 
* N3krozoft Ltd – This multimedia art collective was using NATO.0+55 in live performances and video installations up to 2004.
* Fork Unstable Media – German design team. Did an installation using NATO at Sónar 2000 (Barcelona Museum of Modern Art). Created shprootC3ll, a freeware videomixer built with NATO, in 1999. 
* John Dekron – developed the first version of his commercial VJing software ES_5 (now ES_X) with NATO. 
* Meta – produced numerous videos and internet applications built with NATO. 
* Rene Beekman – used NATO.0+55 in a number of collaborative performance projects, including &quot;Route&quot; (premiered December 2000 at the opening night of the Amsterdam World Wide Video Festival) with Bruce Gremo, and with Xavier van Wersch at Dot Nu (September 2001, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, The Netherlands) and at the International Media Art Festival, Kyiv, Ukraine (2002).

<doc id="240712" wikidata="Q2560390" url="?curid=240712" title="Lisa's Rival">
<text>&quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot; is the second episode of the sixth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It originally aired on Fox in the United States on September 11, 1994. Winona Ryder guest stars as Allison Taylor, a new student at Springfield Elementary School. Lisa Simpson begins to feel threatened by Allison because she is smarter, younger, and a better saxophone player. The episode&#x27;s subplot sees Homer steal a large pile of sugar from a crashed truck and sell it door-to-door. This episode was originally going to air as part of Season 5 but aired as a season six episode due to 1994 Northridge earthquake.

The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Mark Kirkland. &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot; was the first episode written by Scully. The episode was originally pitched by former writer Conan O&#x27;Brien, while the subplot was suggested by George Meyer. It features references to films such as &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot;. Production of the episode was affected by the 1994 Northridge earthquake.

==Plot==
Allison Taylor joins the second-grade class at Springfield Elementary. Noticing she and Allison have many interests in common, Lisa befriends Allison. However, Lisa discovers that Allison&#x27;s academic and creative talents are superior to her own and begins to doubt herself. Lisa and Allison both audition for first chair in the school band. Lisa, overcome with jealousy, plays her saxophone so intensely she passes out. To Lisa&#x27;s horror, Allison wins first chair.

Meanwhile, Homer finds an overturned sugar truck and steals large amounts of sugar. Homer hatches a scheme to get rich by selling sugar door-to-door. He keeps the sugar piled in his backyard, where he obsessively guards it. Marge grows annoyed by Homer&#x27;s scheme and paranoia and tells him to get rid of the sugar pile at once. He refuses and accuses her of trying to sabotage his business prospects. Soon, the sugar attracts bees from a local apiary; two beekeepers track the swarm to Homer&#x27;s yard and offer to buy the bees back for $2,000. Before the transaction is completed, rain starts to fall, dissolving the sugar. The bees fly away, leaving Homer with no money and no sugar.

Like Lisa was before her, Allison is teased by students who mock her interests. Allison invites Lisa for a play date at her house, where Lisa&#x27;s insecurity increases further due to Allison&#x27;s cultured family and her vast number of academic awards. Prior to Springfield Elementary&#x27;s annual diorama competition, Bart offers to help Lisa sabotage Allison&#x27;s well-constructed entry. Bart distracts the teachers and other students, allowing Lisa to switch Allison&#x27;s diorama of &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; with one featuring a cow&#x27;s heart. When Principal Skinner discovers the cow&#x27;s heart diorama, he humiliates Allison in front of the students and faculty. Overcome by guilt, Lisa retrieves Allison&#x27;s real diorama from its hiding place under the floor. However, Skinner is unimpressed by both Allison and Lisa&#x27;s entries and gives first prize to Ralph&#x27;s collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; figurines. Lisa apologizes to Allison for sabotaging the contest; Allison forgives Lisa, and they become friends again. Ralph trips over his action figures, and Lisa and Allison invite him to play with them.

==Production==

Production of the episode was disrupted by the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which also affected the previous episode &quot;Bart of Darkness&quot;. The Film Roman building used by the staff was so badly damaged it had to be condemned. They were relocated to a new building for a year, and much of the animation for the episode was done by people at their own homes. The day after the earthquake, the only staff members who turned up for work were Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. Overall production of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was disrupted for six months, with a month of production time being lost.

Although written by Mike Scully, the episode&#x27;s original concept was pitched by Conan O&#x27;Brien before he left the show. O&#x27;Brien suggested having an episode about a rival for Lisa, but the rest of the episode&#x27;s storyline was written by Scully and other staff members. It was the first episode Scully wrote for the show, and he would later become showrunner. Winona Ryder guest starred as Allison Taylor. She was a fan of the show and was popular amongst the staff. David Mirkin recalled that more writers came to her recording session than any other. Her character&#x27;s name was derived from the names of two of Scully&#x27;s daughters, Allison and Taylor. The subplot was pitched by George Meyer. Homer&#x27;s sugar diatribe was pitched by Meyer off the top of his head and animated by David Silverman, who specifically asked to animate the scene after listening to Dan Castellaneta&#x27;s performance.

==Cultural references==

Marge is seen reading the maritime romance &quot;Love in the time of Scurvy&quot;, the title of which plays on Gabriel Garcia Marquez&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera.&quot; Milhouse&#x27;s sub-story is a reference to &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1993). It is principally parodied in the scene where Milhouse is at the end of a dam drainpipe and dives into a waterfall when being held at gunpoint by an FBI agent resembling Tommy Lee Jones, who uses the film&#x27;s famous line &quot;I don&#x27;t care&quot;. Homer&#x27;s &quot;In America&quot; speech while guarding his sugar pile is a reference to Tony Montana&#x27;s speech in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983), and his line &quot;Oh what a world!&quot; when the sugar melts is from the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). The speech patterns of the beekeeper voiced by Hank Azaria are based on Adam West&#x27;s portrayal of Batman.

At Allison&#x27;s house, the family plays a game of anagrams, rearranging the letters in a person&#x27;s name to make a description of that person. Allison&#x27;s father gives her Alec Guinness and she comes up with &quot;Genuine class&quot;. He gives Lisa Jeremy Irons and she comes up with &quot;Jeremy&#x27;s iron&quot;. Lisa imagines herself playing with &quot;The Second Best Band in America&quot;, featuring the less-famous halves of pop music duos: Art Garfunkel of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Jim Messina of Loggins and Messina and John Oates of Hall &amp; Oates. Allison&#x27;s diorama is based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, and Lisa&#x27;s hiding of it under the gym floorboards is a parody of Poe&#x27;s tale. For her diorama, Lisa constructs &quot;all 75 characters from &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. Ralph&#x27;s diorama contest entry is just original &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures: his collection includes Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Chewbacca.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Rival&quot; finished tied for 23rd place (with &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;) in the weekly ratings for the week of September 5 to September 11, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 9.9. It was the second highest rated show on the Fox Network that week.

In a 2008 article, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named Winona Ryder&#x27;s role as Allison Taylor as one of the sixteen best &quot;The Simpsons&quot; guest stars, while &quot;IGN&quot; placed her sixth on their list of the &quot;Top 25 Simpsons Guest Stars&quot;. They also highlighted Ralph&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; lines: &quot;I bent my Wookiee&quot;, and &quot;My cat&#x27;s breath smells like cat food&quot;.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot;, stated: &quot;Despite being a Lisa show, it is poor Ralph Wiggum who steals the show with three great irrelevant replies, especially those concerning his cat&#x27;s breath.&quot; They also highlighted &quot;great scenes between the Simpson siblings, especially Bart&#x27;s idea to conquer Allison using a hose pipe&quot;.

<doc id="240716" wikidata="Q6999812" url="?curid=240716" title="Netochka Nezvanova (author)">
<text>Netochka Nezvanova is the pseudonym used by the author(s) of nato.0+55+3d, a real-time, modular, video and multi-media processing environment. Alternate aliases include &quot;=cw4t7abs&quot;, &quot;punktprotokol&quot;, &quot;0f0003&quot;, &quot;maschinenkunst&quot; (preferably spelled &quot;m2zk!n3nkunzt&quot;), &quot;integer&quot;, and &quot;antiorp&quot;. The name itself is adopted from the main character of Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Netochka Nezvanova&quot; (1849) and translates as &quot;nameless nobody.&quot;

==Identity==
Netochka Nezvanova has been described by cultural critics as &quot;an elusive online identity&quot; and &quot;a collective international project&quot;. In 2020, art critic Amber Husain describes NN as an &quot;avatar of avant-garde internet performance&quot; that &quot;became as known for her abstract and usable software artworks as she did for aggressive displays of anonymous cyber-domination&quot;.

In 2001, Netochka Nezvanova was named as one of the Top 25 Women on the Web by a San Francisco non-profit group.

In her article published March 2002 for online magazine Salon, Katharine Mieszkowki dubbed NN the &quot;most feared woman on the Internet&quot;, and speculated on her real identity – &quot;A female New Zealander artist, a male Icelander musician or an Eastern European collective conspiracy?&quot;.

Florian Cramer stated that NN &quot;was a collective international project&quot; that &quot;presented itself as a sectarian cult, with its software as the object of worship&quot;. Cramer describes how the origin of NN&#x27;s messages was obscured by &quot;a web of servers and domain registrations spanning New Zealand, Denmark and Italy&quot;, while Mieszkowki observes that &quot;e-mail from Netochka&#x27;s various aliases has also been sent from ISPs in Chicago, New Zealand, Australia and Amsterdam&quot;.

In 2006, the Austrian &quot;Institut für Medienarchäologie&quot; (IMA) released a 20-minute documentary film, directed by Elisabeth Schimana, titled &quot;Rebekah Wilson aka Netochka Nezvanova&quot;. In this video documentary, Rebekah Wilson discusses her central role in the NN collective, disclosing how she legally changed her name to Netochka Nezvanova in 1999, before changing it back to her birth name in 2005.

== Software works ==
Besides the numerous software projects, her CD entitled &quot;KROP3ROM||A9FF&quot; was released by Decibel Records in 1997. A second CD entitled sin(x) was released by 0f0003 in 2000.

==Other software created by NN==
* 0f0003 propaganda (1998) - this program algorithmically generates animated graphics and synthetic sounds.
* b1257+12 (1998) - a software for sound deconstruction and composition. The intricate operator interface allows for radical manipulation of soundloops in realtime, offering a large amount of control parameters which, every now and then, take a life of their own. The name of the software refers to a rapidly rotating neutron star.
* @¶31®�≠ Ÿ (1998) - this software extracts random samples from a CD and creates a stochastical remix, accompanied by futuristic-looking graphics (according to the reference documents, it is intended for use with the krop3rom||a9ff release).
* m9ndfukc.0+99 and k!berzveta.0+2 (1999) - two programs written in Java interpreting network data, very likely preliminary versions of nebula.m81. In a 2018 interview, Andrew McKenzie describes m9ndfukc.0+99 as &quot;a way to visualize, in a creative way, many different perspectives on the same data. It was basically a Java application in a browser&quot;.
* kinematek.0+2 (1999) - another Java application that performs &quot;animated image generation from internet www data&quot;, incorporating parts of nebula.m81.
* nebula.m81 (1999) - an experimental web browser written in Java, rendering HTML code into abstract sounds and graphics. Awarded at the International Music Software Competition in Bourges 1999 and at Transmediale 2001 (first prize in the category &quot;Artistic Software&quot;). Described by jury member Florian Cramer as &quot;an experimental web browser that turned browsing into something resembling measurement data evaluation&quot;.
* !=z2c!ja.0+38 (1999) - an application that generates a dense visual texture based on the user&#x27;s keyboard input. It (ab)uses Mac OS&#x27; QuickDraw capability and can therefore be seen as a preliminary step towards nato.0+55.

==Musical works==
* &quot;krop3ropm||a9ff&quot;, audio CD, Decibel Records, 1997 (re-released by 0f0003 in 1998, with additional material by The Hafler Trio).
* &quot;A9FF&quot; (1997), a piece for tape by Rebekah Wilson, performed at Victoria University of Wellington in February 1998.
* &quot;8&#x27;|sin.x(2^n)&quot;, hybrid CD containing audio and mp2 data tracks (1999, self-produced).
* Trilogy of theatre pieces in collaboration with vocalist Ayelet Harpaz, based on haikus by the Japanese poet Masaoka Shiki (&quot;Two Autumns&quot;, &quot;I Keep Asking How Deep The Snow&#x27;s Gotten&quot;; &quot;Spring: Still Unfurled&quot;; presented in Utrecht, Amsterdam and Moscow, 2001–2002).
* &quot;Poztgenom!knuklearporekomplekz&quot;, included on the CD &quot;Strewth! An Abstract Electronic Compilation&quot;, published in 2002 by the Australian record label Synaesthesia.

<doc id="240717" wikidata="Q516494" url="?curid=240717" title="Tangerine">
<text>The tangerine is a type of citrus fruit that is orange in color, that is considered either a variety of &quot;Citrus reticulata&quot;, the mandarin orange, or a closely related species, under the name Citrus tangerina, or yet as a hybrid (Citrus&quot; × &quot;tangerina) of mandarin orange varieties, with some pomelo contribution.

== Etymology==

The word &quot;tangerine&quot; was originally an adjective meaning &quot;of or pertaining to, or native of Tangier, a seaport in Morocco, on the Strait of Gibraltar&quot;, and &quot;a native of Tangier.&quot; The name was first used for fruit coming from Tangier, Morocco, described as a mandarin variety. The OED cites this usage from Addison&#x27;s &quot;The Tatler&quot; in 1710 with similar uses from the 1800s. The adjective was applied to the fruit, once known scientifically as &quot;&quot;Citrus nobilis&quot; var. &quot;tangeriana&quot;&quot; which grew in the region of Tangiers. This usage appears in the 1800s.

== Taxonomy ==

Under the Tanaka classification system, &quot;Citrus tangerina&quot; is considered a separate species. Under the Swingle system, tangerines are considered a group of mandarin (&quot;C. reticulata&quot;) varieties. Some differ only in disease resistance. The term is also currently applied to any reddish-orange mandarin (and, in some jurisdictions, mandarin-like hybrids, including some tangors).

== Description ==

Tangerines are smaller and less rounded than oranges. They taste less sour, as well as sweeter and stronger, than oranges do. A ripe tangerine is firm to slightly soft, and pebbly-skinned with no deep grooves, as well as orange in color. The peel is thin, with little bitter white mesocarp. All of these traits are shared by mandarins generally.

The peak tangerine season lasts from autumn to spring. Tangerines are most commonly peeled and eaten by hand. The fresh fruit is also used in salads, desserts and main dishes. The peel is used fresh or dried as a spice or zest for baking and drinks. Fresh tangerine juice and frozen juice concentrate are commonly available in the United States.

== Production ==

In 2021, world production of tangerines (including mandarins and clementines) was 42 million tonnes, led by China with 60% of the total (table).

== Nomenclature and varieties ==

Tangerines were first grown and cultivated as a distinct crop in the Americas by a Major Atway in Palatka, Florida. Atway was said to have imported them from Morocco (more specifically its third-largest city, the port of Tangier), which was the origin of the name. Major Atway sold his groves to N. H. Moragne in 1843, giving the Moragne tangerine the other part of its name.

The Moragne tangerine produced a seedling which became one of the oldest and most popular American varieties, the Dancy tangerine (zipper-skin tangerine, kid-glove orange). Genetic analysis has shown the parents of the Dancy to have been two mandarin orange hybrids each with a small pomelo contribution, a Ponkan mandarin orange and a second unidentified mandarin. The Dancy is no longer widely commercially grown; it is too delicate to handle and ship well, it is susceptible to &quot;Alternaria&quot; fungus, and it bears more heavily in alternate years. Dancys are still grown for personal consumption, and many hybrids of the Dancy are grown commercially.

Until the 1970s, the Dancy was the most widely grown tangerine in the United States; the popularity of the fruit led to the term &quot;tangerine&quot; being broadly applied as a marketing name. Florida classifies tangerine-like hybrid fruits as tangerines for the purposes of sale and regulation; this classification is widely used but regarded as technically inaccurate in the industry. Among the most important tangerine hybrids of Florida are murcotts (a late-fruiting type of tangor marketed as &quot;honey tangerine&quot;) and Sunbursts (an early-fruiting complex tangerine-orange-grapefruit hybrid). The fallglo, also a three-way hybrid ( tangerine, orange and grapefruit), is also grown.

== Nutrition ==

Tangerines contain 85% water, 13% carbohydrates, and negligible amounts of fat and protein (table). Among micronutrients, only vitamin C is in significant content (30% of the Daily Value) in a reference serving, with all other micronutrients in low amounts.

<doc id="240718" wikidata="Q525302" url="?curid=240718" title="Obstruction of justice in the United States">
<text>In United States jurisdictions, obstruction of justice refers to a number of offenses that involve unduly influencing, impeding, or otherwise interfering with the justice system, especially the legal and procedural tasks of prosecutors, investigators, or other government officials. Common law jurisdictions other than the United States tend to use the wider offense of perverting the course of justice.

Obstruction is a broad crime that may include acts such as perjury, making false statements to officials, witness tampering, jury tampering, destruction of evidence, and many others. Obstruction also applies to overt coercion of court or government officials via the means of threats or actual physical harm, and also applying to deliberate sedition against a court official to undermine the appearance of legitimate authority.

==Legal overview==
Obstruction of justice is an umbrella term covering a variety of specific crimes. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines it as any &quot;interference with the orderly administration of law and justice&quot;. Obstruction has been categorized by various sources as a process crime, a public-order crime, or a white-collar crime.

Obstruction can include crimes committed by judges, prosecutors, attorneys general, and elected officials in general.

===Federal law===
In federal law, crimes constituting obstruction of justice are defined primarily in Chapter 73 of Title 18 of the United States Code. This chapter contains provisions covering various specific crimes such as witness tampering and retaliation, jury tampering, destruction of evidence, assault on a process server, and theft of court records. It also includes more general sections covering obstruction of proceedings in federal courts, Congress, and federal executive agencies. One of the broadest provisions in the chapter, known as the Omnibus Clause, states that anyone who &quot;corruptly... endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice&quot; in connection with a pending court proceeding is subject to punishment.

Statistics regarding the frequency of obstruction of justice prosecutions are unclear. In 2004, federal agencies arrested 446 people for obstruction, representing 0.3 percent of all federal arrests. This does not include, however, people who were charged with obstruction in addition to a more serious underlying crime.
====Sentencing enhancement====
Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant convicted of any crime is subject to a more severe sentence if they are found to have obstructed justice by impeding the investigation or prosecution of their crimes. While a separate conviction for the crime of obstruction would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, a finding of obstruction for sentencing purposes only needs to meet the looser standard of &quot;a preponderance of the evidence&quot; (unless the enhanced sentence would exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the underlying crime).

An obstruction finding adds two levels to the offender&#x27;s sentence, which can result in as much as an additional 68 months of prison. In 2017, the obstruction enhancement was applied in 1,319 cases, representing 2.1 percent of all sentences issued in federal courts.

===State law===
State laws regarding obstruction of justice vary widely. A 2004 survey found that 24 states and the District of Columbia had a general statute criminalizing obstruction of justice or obstruction of government functions in broad terms, similar to those found in federal law. All states have laws prohibiting some specific types of obstruction, such as witness tampering, jury tampering, or destruction of evidence.

==History==
From the creation of the federal courts by the Judiciary Act of 1789, judges had the power to summarily punish those who obstructed justice by holding them in contempt of court.

A scandal in 1830 led to reform of the contempt law and the creation of obstruction of justice as a separate offense. Federal judge James H. Peck imprisoned a lawyer for contempt for publishing a letter criticizing one of Peck&#x27;s opinions. In an effort to prevent such abuses, Congress passed a law in 1831 limiting the application of the summary contempt procedures to offenses committed in or near the court. A new section, which survives today as the Omnibus Clause, was added to punish contempts committed outside of the court, but only after indictment and trial by jury.

In 1982, in response to concerns that the obstruction law did not provide adequate protection to crime victims and other witnesses, Congress broadened the law against witness tampering and criminalized retaliation against witnesses, as part of the Victim and Witness Protection Act.

The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 strengthened the obstruction laws regarding destruction of evidence before an investigation or proceeding has begun, in response to accounting firm Arthur Andersen&#x27;s widely reported shredding of documents related to the Enron scandal.

==Notable examples==
*The impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in 1974 included charges of obstruction of justice for impeding the investigation of the Watergate burglary. Nixon&#x27;s acts of obstruction, as alleged by the House Judiciary Committee, included lying to investigators and withholding evidence, influencing witnesses (including through payments of hush money), and making false statements to the public about the investigation. Nixon resigned before impeachment could be considered by the full House of Representatives, and he was preemptively pardoned by Gerald Ford before any criminal investigation could occur.
*In the wake of the Iran–Contra affair, several members of the Reagan Administration were charged with obstruction of justice for alleged actions including lying to the Congressional committees investigating the matter and concealing evidence.
*The impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998 included allegations that Clinton obstructed justice by trying to influence the testimony of witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, and by encouraging Lewinsky to conceal evidence.

<text>Cham () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Regen, Straubing-Bogen, Regensburg and Schwandorf and by the Czech Plzeň Region.

== History ==
The first historical date in the regional history is the year 748, when the bishop of Regensburg ordered the foundation of a monastery in the sparsely populated region. About 100 years later, the royal castle of Cham was built and became a summer residence for the Holy Roman Emperors. The region was called &quot;Campriche&quot; or &quot;Mark Cham&quot;. In 1204, the Mark Cham became subject to Bavaria, in 1352 to the Electorate of the Palatinate and in the 17th century back to Bavaria. Nowadays, Cham still enjoys the laid-back lifestyle from the days of yore. Many projects have been initiated to give this area an impetus to grow, yet in spite of this, it is still one of the least-populated regions in Germany.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the northern parts of the Bavarian Forest. It is situated within the borders of the &quot;Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park&quot;. The highest mountain is the &quot;Großer Arber&quot; at 1,439 m, located near the Germany–Czech Republic border. The Regen river enters the district in the southeast and leaves to the west; most of the settled places are situated along this river and its main tributary, the Chamb coming from the Czech border.

== Coat of arms ==
The upper part of the arms is occupied by the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria. The church of Chammünster (today belonging to the town of Cham), which was built in 748 within a famous monastery, is displayed below.

<text>In the field of international relations, a sphere of influence (SOI) is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity.

While there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of soft power. Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another&#x27;s sphere of influence. High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.

In more extreme cases, a country within the &quot;sphere of influence&quot; of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or &quot;de facto&quot; colony. This was the case with the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc after World War II. The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present. It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers.

Sometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence. In the 19th century, the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying between the empires of Britain, France and Russia, were divided between the spheres of influence of those three international powers. Likewise, after World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, three of which later consolidated into West Germany and the remaining one became East Germany, the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the Warsaw Pact.

==Historical remnants==
Before modern international relations were established in Europe, many powerful states had subordinate tributary states, in which the less powerful states or kingdoms submit to the payment of tribute in order to maintain a degree of independence.

As European nation-states built empires in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific,
often under the aegis of international law, the concept of &quot;protectorate&quot; and &quot;spheres of influence&quot; for characterizing relations of military and political domination emerged. Many areas of the world are joined by a cultural influence inherited from a previous sphere of influence, even if they are no longer under political control. Examples include Anglosphere, Arab World, Persosphere, Eurosphere, Francophonie, , Germanosphere, Indosphere, Hispanidad, Latin Europe/Latin America, Lusophonie, Turkosphere, Sinosphere, Slavisphere, Malay world, Post-Soviet States and many others.

== Early United States (1820s) ==

Alexander Hamilton, first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, aimed for the United States to establish a sphere of influence in North America. Hamilton, writing in the Federalist Papers, harboured ambitions for the US to rise to world power status and gain the strength to expel European powers from the Americas, taking on the mantle of regional dominance among American nations, although most of the New World were European colonies during that period.

This doctrine, dubbed the &#x27;Monroe Doctrine&#x27;, was formalized under President James Monroe, who asserted that the New World was to be established as a Sphere of influence, removed from European encroachment. As the U.S. emerged as a world power, few nations dared to trespass on this sphere (A notable exception occurred with the Soviet Union and the Cuban Missile Crisis.).

As of 2018, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson continued to refer to the Monroe Doctrine to tout the United States as the region&#x27;s preferred trade partner over other nations such as China.

== New Imperialism era (late 1800s – early 1900s) ==

For Siam (Thailand), Britain and France signed an agreement in 1904 whereby the British recognised a French sphere of influence to the east of the River Menam&#x27;s (Chao Phraya River) basin; in turn, the French recognised British influence over the territory to the west of the Menam basin and west of the Gulf of Thailand. Both parties disclaimed any idea of annexing Siamese territory.

In the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, Britain and Russia divided Persia (Iran) into spheres of influence, with the Russians gaining recognition for influence over most of northern Iran, and Britain establishing a zone in the Southeast.

===China===
In China, during the mid 19th and 20th centuries (known in China as the &quot;century of humiliation&quot;), Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and Japan held special powers over large swaths of Chinese territory based on securing &quot;nonalienation commitments&quot; for their &quot;spheres of interest&quot;; only the United States was unable to participate due to their involvement in the Spanish–American War. These spheres of influence were acquired by forcing the Qing government to sign &quot;unequal treaties&quot; and long-term leases.

In early 1895, the French laid claim to a sphere in Southwest China. By December 1897, German Kaiser Wilhelm II declared his intent to seize territory in China, precipitating the scramble to demarcate zones of influence in China. The Germans acquired, in Shandong province, exclusive control over developmental loans, mining, and railway ownership, while Russia gained a sphere over all territory north of the Great Wall, in addition to the previous tax exemption for trade in Mongolia and Xinjiang, economic powers similar to Germany&#x27;s over Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. France gained a sphere over Yunnan, as well as most of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces; Japan over Fujian province; and the British over the whole Yangtze River valley (defined as all provinces adjoining the Yangtze river as well as Henan and Zhejiang provinces), parts of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, and part of Tibet. Only Italy&#x27;s request for Zhejiang province was declined by the Chinese government. These do not include the lease and concession territories where the foreign powers had full authority.

The Russian government militarily occupied their zone, imposed their law and schools, seized mining and logging privileges, settled their citizens, and even established their municipal administration on several cities, the latter without Chinese consent.

The powers (and the United States) might have their own courts, post offices, commercial institutions, railroads, and gunboats in what was on paper Chinese territory. However, the foreign powers and their control in some cases could have been exaggerated; the local government persistently restricted further encroachment. The system ended after the Second World War.

On September 6, 1899, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay sent notes to the major powers (France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan, and Russia), asking them to declare formally that they would uphold Chinese territorial and administrative integrity and would not interfere with the free use of the treaty ports within their spheres of influence in China, as the United States felt threatened by other powers&#x27; much larger spheres of influence in China and worried that it might lose access to the Chinese market should the country be officially partitioned. Although treaties made after 1900 refer to this &quot;Open Door Policy&quot;, competition among the various powers for special concessions within China for railroad rights, mining rights, loans, foreign trade ports, and so forth, continued unabated, with the US itself contradicting the policy by agreeing to recognise the Japanese sphere in the Lansing-Ishii Agreement.

In 1910, the great powers, Britain, France, Germany, United States, and later, Russia and Japan, ignored the Open Door Policy to form a banking consortium, consisting of national banking groups backed by respective governments, through which all foreign loans to China were monopolised, granting the powers political influence over China and reducing economic competition between foreigners. This organisation controlled the majority of Chinese tax revenue in a &quot;trust&quot;, utilising a small portion to bolster the rule of Chinese warlord Yuan Shikai to great effect. The renewed consortium of UK, France, Japan and the U.S. in 1920 effectively vetoed all developmental loans to China, exerting control over the Chinese government by aiming to control all railroads, ports and highways in China. The Consortium helped to contain the political and financial conflict between parties and states over the loans, while imposing foreign control on China&#x27;s finances during the period of revolutionary upheaval, which the Consortium also helped to precipitate.

== World War II (1939–1945) ==

=== Empire of Japan ===

For another example, during the height of its existence in World War II, the Japanese Empire had quite a large sphere of influence. The Japanese government directly governed events in Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and parts of Mainland China. The &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot; could thus be quite easily drawn on a map of the Pacific Ocean as a large &quot;bubble&quot; surrounding the islands of Japan and the Asian and Pacific nations it controlled.

===Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact===
According to a secret protocol attached to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 (revealed only after Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945), Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence:

* In the north, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.
* Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its &quot;political rearrangement&quot;—the areas east of the Narev, Vistula, and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union, while Germany would occupy the west.
* Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned Lithuania to the USSR.

Another clause of the treaty stipulated that Bessarabia, then part of Romania, would join the Moldovan ASSR and become the Moldovan SSR under the control of Moscow. The Soviet invasion of Bukovina on 28 June 1940 violated the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence as agreed with the Axis. The USSR continued to deny the existence of the Pact&#x27;s protocols until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union when the Russian government fully acknowledged the existence and authenticity of the secret protocols.

===End of World War II===
From 1941 and the German attack on the Soviet Union, the Allied Coalition operated on the unwritten assumption that the Western Powers and the Soviet Union had each its own sphere of influence. The presumption of the US-British and Soviet unrestricted rights in their respective spheres began to cause difficulties as the Nazi-controlled territory shrank and the allied powers successively liberated other states.

The wartime spheres lacked a practical definition and it had never been determined if a dominant allied power was entitled to unilateral decisions only in the area of military activity, or could also force its will regarding political, social and economic future of other states. This overly informal system backfired during the late stages of the war and afterward, when it turned out that the Soviets and the Western Allies had very different ideas concerning the administration and future development of the liberated regions and of Germany itself.

== Cold War (1947–1991) ==

During the Cold War, the Soviet sphere of influence was said to include: the Baltic states, Central Europe, some countries in Eastern Europe, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, North Korea, and—until the Sino-Soviet split and Tito–Stalin split—the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, among other countries at various times. Meanwhile, United States was considered to have a sphere of influence over Western Europe, Oceania, Japan, South Vietnam and South Korea, among other places.

However, the level of control exerted in these spheres varied and was not absolute. For instance, France and the United Kingdom were able to act independently to invade (with Israel) the Suez Canal (they were later forced to withdraw by joint U.S. and Soviet pressure). Later, France was also able to withdraw from the military arm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Cuba, as another example, often took positions that put it at odds with its Soviet ally, including momentary alliances with China, economic reorganizations, and providing support for insurgencies in Africa and the Americas without prior approval from the Soviet Union.

With the end of the Cold War, the Eastern Bloc fell apart, effectively ending the Soviet sphere of influence. Then in 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, replaced by the Russian Federation and several other ex-Soviet Republics who became independent states.

== Contemporary Russia (1990s–&quot;present&quot;) ==
Following the fall of the Soviet Union, the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States that became independent in 1991, were portrayed as part of the Russian Federation&#x27;s &#x27;sphere of influence&#x27;, according to a statement by Boris Yeltsin, dated September 1994.

According to Ulrich Speck, writing for &quot;Carnegie Europe&quot;, &quot;After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the West&#x27;s focus was on Russia. Western nations implicitly treated the post-Soviet countries (besides the Baltic states) as Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence.&quot;

In 1997, NATO and Russia signed the &quot;Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security&quot;, stating the &quot;aim of creating in Europe a common space of security and stability, without dividing lines or spheres of influence limiting the sovereignty of any state.&quot;

On August 31, 2008, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev stated five principles of foreign policy, including the claim of a privileged sphere of influence that comprised &quot;the border region, but not only&quot;. 

Following the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Václav Havel and other former central and eastern European leaders signed an open letter stating that Russia had &quot;violated the core principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris ... all in the name of defending a sphere of influence on its borders.&quot; In April 2014, NATO stated that, contrary to the &quot;Founding Act&quot;,Russia now appears to be attempting to recreate a sphere of influence by seizing a part of Ukraine, maintaining large numbers of forces on its borders, and demanding, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov recently stated, that &quot;Ukraine cannot be part of any bloc.&quot;Criticising Russia in November 2014, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that &quot;old thinking about spheres of influence, which runs roughshod over international law&quot; put the &quot;entire European peace order into question.&quot; In January 2017, British Prime Minister Theresa May said, &quot;We should not jeopardise the freedoms that President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher brought to Eastern Europe by accepting President Putin&#x27;s claim that it is now in his sphere of influence.&quot;

== Contemporary European Union (1990s–&quot;present&quot;) ==
In 2009, Russia asserted that the European Union desires a sphere of influence and that the Eastern Partnership is &quot;an attempt to extend&quot; it. In March that year, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt stated that the &quot;Eastern Partnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these countries themselves opted to join.&quot;

==Corporations==
In corporate terms, the sphere of influence of a business, organization, or group can show its power and influence in the decisions of other businesses/organizations/groups. The influence shows in several ways, such as in size, frequency of visits, etc. In most cases, a company described as &quot;bigger&quot; has a larger sphere of influence.

For example, the software company Microsoft has a large sphere of influence in the market of operating systems; any entity wishing to sell a software product may weigh up compatibility with Microsoft&#x27;s products as part of a marketing plan. In another example, retailers wishing to make the most profits must ensure they open their stores in the correct location. This is also true for shopping centers that, to reap the most profits, must be able to attract customers to their vicinity.

There is no defined scale measuring such spheres of influence. However, one can evaluate the spheres of influence of two shopping centers by seeing how far people are prepared to travel to each shopping center, how much time they spend in its vicinity, how often they visit, the order of goods available, etc.

Corporations have significant influence on the regulations and regulators that monitor them. During the Gilded Age in the United States, corruption was rampant as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate their activities. Wall Street spent a record $2 billion trying to influence the 2016 United States elections.

<text>Ciprian Porumbescu (; born Cyprian Gołęmbiowski on 14 October 1853 – 6 June 1883) was a Romanian composer born in Șipotele Sucevei in Bucovina. He was among the most celebrated Romanian composers of his time; his popular works include &quot;Crai nou&quot;, &quot;Song of the Tricolour&quot;, &quot;Song for Spring&quot;, &quot;Ballad for violin and piano&quot;, and &quot;Serenada&quot;. In addition, he composed the music for the Romanian patriotic &quot;Song of Unity&quot;, also known as &quot;Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire&quot; (&quot;On our flag is written Unity&quot;), which was Romania&#x27;s anthem from 1975 to 1977 and is currently used for Albania&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;Himni i Flamurit&quot;. His work spreads over various forms and musical genres, but the majority of his work is choral and operetta.

==Biography==
Ciprian Porumbescu was born into the family of Iraclie Gołęmbiowski a Romanian Orthodox priest and Emilia Clodnițchi, Polish, daughter of the forest brigadier from Voievodeasa. Iraclie Gołęmbiowski called himself Iraclie Porumbescu from his youth, but he did not officially change his name until 1881, when Ciprian was at school in Suceava. He studied music in Suceava and Cernăuți, then continued at the &quot;Konservatorium für Musik und darstellende Kunst&quot; in Vienna from 1879 to 1881 under Anton Bruckner and Franz Krenn. His artistic career as a composer, conductor, violinist, and pianist started in Cernăuți, and continued in Vienna, and later in Brașov where he taught vocal music at Romanian schools.

Ciprian Porumbescu wrote poetry, lyrics and press articles, and actively participated in public cultural life. He helped the rise of the Romanian music school during an age of enthusiasm generated by Romania&#x27;s independence. Some of the most remarkable musical pages of the composer were inspired by national heroes and great army leaders, such as Stephen III of Moldavia and Dragoș Vodă. The appreciation of his music came from the melodic nature of his compositions and their folklore inspiration.

In 1877, Porumbescu was arrested by the Austrian authorities due to his political ideals of Bucovina independence manifested within the Arboroasa society; Arboroasa was an ultra nationalistic Romanian organisation in Cernowitz (Cernăuți). During detention, he contracted tuberculosis. He was released later after being found not guilty, going on to become a founding member of Societatea Academică Junimea (Junimea Academic Society). He died at the age of 29 in Stupca, which was renamed Ciprian Porumbescu in his honor.

Ciprian Porumbescu left a legacy of more than 250 works, bringing him fame and popularity through his short life. The composer saw his work &quot;Crai nou&quot; (&quot;New Moon&quot;) performed in Brașov, while his vocal works &quot;Pe-al nostru steag&quot; (&quot;On Our Flag&quot;), &quot;Tricolorul&quot; (&quot;The Tricolor&quot;, dedicated to Romania&#x27;s national flag), &quot;Cântec de primăvară&quot; (&quot;Spring Song&quot;), &quot;Serenada&quot;, &quot;Cântecul gintei latine&quot; (&quot;Latin Nation&#x27;s Song&quot;), &quot;La malurile Prutului&quot; (&quot;On the Shores of the Prut River&quot;), and &quot;Altarul mânăstirii Putna&quot; (&quot;Putna Monastery&#x27;s Altar&quot;) were already in the public conscience.

==Major works==

=== Crai Nou === 
As a student at the Vienna Musical Conservatory, Porumbescu noted with great interest the success of operettas by Strauss, Suppé, Offenbach and others. His supreme goal was to replace the frivolity of subject-matter in the fashionable operettas with a plot that revived old Romanian traditions. Among them was &quot;Crai Nou&quot; (New Moon), in which the new-born moon will fulfill every lover&#x27;s dreams of happiness (collected and published by Vasile Alecsandri), appeared the most appropriate for the dream-like environment of the local and earnest task he had in mind. The result was Romania&#x27;s first operetta of the same name.

=== Ballad for Violin and Orchestra ===
Finished on 21 October 1880, the Ballad for Violin and Orchestra soon became the best known work by Ciprian Porumbescu, and a reference work in Romanian classical music of the 19th century. In seclusion at Stupca, the composer meditated, drafted and then finished the piece, full of poetry and bitter nostalgia, with light and shade, a mixture of &quot;Doina&quot;, old dance and song, everything in the environment of serene melancholy.

<text>Amy Christine Dumas (born April 14, 1975) is an American retired professional wrestler and singer. She is best known for her tenure in WWE under the ring name Lita. An inductee of the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame, Dumas is regarded as one of the greatest female performers in WWE history.

Initially using the name of Angelica, Dumas started her wrestling career in Mexico with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in 1998, followed by briefly working on the US independent circuit in early 1999, and then working for six months in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Dumas then signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, renamed to WWE in 2002) in August 1999, debuting in February 2000 as Lita. She was originally paired with Essa Rios, but she achieved her greatest push alongside Matt and Jeff Hardy as Team Xtreme, and in 2005–2006 was a heel wrestler, including as a manager to Edge. During this time, she became a four-time WWF/WWE Women&#x27;s Champion. She retired from full-time performing in 2006. She then made a couple of appearances on the independent circuit before returning to WWE in 2007, making occasional appearances, sporadically wrestling matches and being inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2014. From 2022 to 2023, she performed on a part-time basis, with her winning the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship with Becky Lynch in 2023, subsequently making her the first female Hall of Famer to win a tag team championship after her induction. She has also worked as a producer and a trainer with the company.

After her first retirement in 2006, she formed the punk rock band The Luchagors. The band released their self-titled debut album on September 11, 2007.

== Early life ==
Amy Christine Dumas was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Christine and Michael Dumas on April 14, 1975. She is of Mexican American, Puerto Rican and French ancestry. She attended many different schools around Florida throughout her childhood and adolescent years and managed to finish high school at Lassiter High School near Atlanta six months before graduation. She majored in education at Georgia State University, but dropped out in 1993 because she felt it was too much like high school.

Later, in Washington, D.C., Dumas played bass guitar in several bands, and worked as a roadie for a band.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1997–1999) ===
Dumas first became interested in wrestling after watching Rey Mysterio Jr., an American luchador, wrestle on an episode of World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (WCW) &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;. She traveled to Mexico in 1997 to learn more about the sport and how to wrestle. Dumas financed her training by dancing in a club under the pseudonym Misty. During her stay in Mexico, Dumas trained under numerous wrestlers, including El Dandy, Kevin Quinn and Ricky Santana. Following the completion of her training, Dumas made several appearances with the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in 1998, under the ring name of Angelica.

After returning to the United States, Dumas continued working as a valet on the independent circuit as Angelica. She made her wrestling debut in a match against indie wrestler Strawberry Fields on January 9, 1999, where she won the match. She worked in Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW), at one point managing Christopher Daniels. She also made appearances in NWA Mid-Atlantic, where she first met Matt and Jeff Hardy, who offered to train with her.

=== Extreme Championship Wrestling (1999) ===

In April 1999, Dumas was approached by Paul Heyman, the owner and booker of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Dumas debuted in ECW as Miss Congeniality, the on-screen girlfriend of Danny Doring. Dumas later began using the name Angelica once again and made her pay-per-view debut on July 18 at Heat Wave where Doring, as part of their storyline, proposed to her with a condom.

Dumas was introduced to veteran wrestler Dory Funk, Jr. by ECW wrestler Rob Van Dam, and Funk invited her to attend his wrestling school, The Funkin&#x27; Conservatory. Dumas attended Funk&#x27;s school alongside twenty-three men, graduated from the school in August 1999, and returned to ECW. Meanwhile, Funk and his wife compiled video footage of Dumas and sent it to the World Wrestling Federation. The Federation was sufficiently impressed, and on August 1, 1999, Dumas was signed to a WWF developmental deal. After six months with ECW, she made her final appearance on October 23, 1999, at Re-enter the Sandman.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999–2006) ===
==== Debut (1999–2000) ====

Dumas debuted on the July 5, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; as part of The Godfather&#x27;s Ho-Train.

After honing her skills at the Memphis Championship Wrestling developmental territory, Dumas was given the ring name Lita and paired with luchador Essa Rios. Lita and Rios made their WWF debut on the February 13, 2000, episode of Sunday Night Heat, where Rios was booked to win the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship from Gillberg (it was only by watching the episode that the two learned their new ring names, decided post-production). Lita mimicked his moves, notably the moonsault and hurricanrana, immediately after he had performed them on an opponent. Essa Rios and Lita had a feud with Eddie Guerrero and Chyna which led to a European title match between Ríos and then-champion Guerrero at Backlash. In May 2000, a storyline was developed in which Lita found Rios cavorting with The Godfather and his &quot;hos&quot;, causing tension between them. Rios eventually turned on Lita by powerbombing her after she inadvertently cost him a match, with the Hardy Boyz coming to her rescue.

==== Team Xtreme (2000–2002) ====
As a member of Team Xtreme, Lita developed a more &quot;alternative&quot; image, wearing baggy pants with a thong, which was hiked up high above her pants, clearly exposed—right after she joined Team Xtreme, her popularity skyrocketed. During her time with Team Xtreme, Lita became the only female to ever be physically involved in Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches in the WWF, effectively interfering at TLC I at Summerslam and TLC II at WrestleMania X-Seven on the Hardy Boyz’ behalf- but her interference was often short-lived as she was brutally Speared at ringside by Edge and 3-D’ed by the Dudley Boyz.

In June 2000, Team Xtreme began a storyline with T &amp; A (Test and Albert), with Lita engaging in a rivalry with their manager, Trish Stratus. The rivalry developed into an off-and-on long-term feud between the two women that lasted until Stratus retired in 2006. The storyline ended shortly after Fully Loaded, where Lita pinned Stratus in a six-person intergender tag team match. The two rivals were then part of the main event of the July 31, 2000, edition of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in Lita&#x27;s hometown of Atlanta, which was a tag team match between Lita &amp; The Rock vs Stratus &amp; Triple H, which Lita and The Rock won. Subsequently, Lita began feuding with WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley after winning the first-ever women&#x27;s battle royal against the likes of Ivory, Jacqueline, Terri and The Kat. In the main event of the August 21, 2000, episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; (her second main event in three weeks), Lita defeated Stephanie with a moonsault to win the Women&#x27;s Championship for the first time, with The Rock as special guest referee. Laster, that week Lita was involved in another main event match on Smackdown, this time teaming with the Rock in a winning effort against Kurt Angle and Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley.

Lita held the Women&#x27;s Championship for 73 days, which included retaining her title in a hardcore match against Jacqueline on October 9. In the course of her reign, Lita became embroiled in the storyline feud between the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian. In retaliation for her frequent interference in their matches, Edge and Christian cost Lita the Women&#x27;s Championship by side-slamming her into the mat, helping Ivory to defeat her in a four-way match on the November 2 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Ivory was in a conservative-based stable named Right to Censor at that time, which targeted Lita for her attire and moves. Lita attempted to regain the title on several occasions, wrestling Ivory in a match at Survivor Series where Ivory cut Lita&#x27;s lower forehead open with her boot heel and she bled heavily, and then another match at Rebellion but Lita was thwarted on each occasion by Steven Richards, Ivory&#x27;s mentor. She spent the remainder of the year in a storyline with would-be suitor Dean Malenko, on one occasion unsuccessfully challenging him for the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship. Even after repeated rejections from Lita followed by savage beatings by the Hardy Boyz, Malenko was undeterred in his quest to win Lita&#x27;s affections.
Lita continued to feud with Dean Malenko in early 2001, and she defeated him in a singles bout on the February 19 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; with the assistance of Matt Hardy. Following the match, Hardy kissed Lita, beginning their on-screen relationship and turning their real-life romance into a storyline. On the April 9 edition of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, she took part in another WWF main event as part of Team Xtreme against a tag team of Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley and the Two Man Power Trip (Stone Cold Steve Austin and Triple H). They won, but Lita took a brutal beating immediately following the match, when she was Pedigreed by Triple H and hit four times in the back with a steel chair by Austin, who finished her off with a Stunner. Austin had just turned heel and this was an attempt to generate even more heat by beating up the most popular female wrestler in the WWF at the time.

In July 2001, Lita and Trish Stratus joined forces to combat Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson, members of The Alliance: Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling wrestlers who were invading the WWF as part of The Invasion storyline. At the Invasion pay-per-view on July 22, Lita and Stratus defeated Keibler and Wilson in the first ever tag team bra and panties match by stripping their opponents to their underwear. Throughout The Invasion, Lita, Stratus, and Jacqueline feuded with Alliance members Keibler, Wilson, Ivory, and Mighty Molly. The Invasion storyline ended on November 18 at Survivor Series, when Lita took part in a six-pack challenge for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship which had been vacated by Chyna earlier that month; Stratus won the match and the title.

In late 2001, the Hardy Boyz began a storyline in which they were feuding with one another. Lita refereed a match between them at Vengeance on December 9. Jeff won the match with a scripted finish that had Lita failing to notice that Matt had placed his leg on the rope during Jeff&#x27;s successful pin attempt. Continuing the storyline on the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Matt defeated Lita and Jeff in a handicap match, shortly after informing Lita that both their relationship and the Hardy Boyz were finished. On the December 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, both Jeff and Lita were sidelined with storyline injuries following a hardcore title match between Jeff and WWF Hardcore Champion The Undertaker, when they were both tossed off the stage by The Undertaker. The injuring of both his brother and ex-girlfriend led to a reconciliation between the members of Team Xtreme, and on the December 20 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Matt faced The Undertaker but was also injured. All three members of Team Xtreme were then removed from WWF television for several weeks.

Team Xtreme returned at the Royal Rumble event in January, with the Hardys as participants and Lita accompanying them. The trio attacked The Undertaker, but were unsuccessful in eliminating him. Lita resumed her pursuit of the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship and made her in-ring WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, facing Stratus and WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Jazz in a match in which Jazz retained her title by pinning Lita.

==== Neck injury and return (2002–2003) ====
On April 6, Dumas suffered what appeared to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent a CAT scan, it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. During her time recovering, Matt and Jeff split thus ending Team Xtreme; Jeff would leave the WWE the following year and Matt would move to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

On the April 21, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by general manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;&#x27;s Torrie Wilson and pose for &quot;Playboy&quot;. She returned to the ring after an absence of seventeen months on the September 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, saving Trish Stratus from a beating at the hands of Molly Holly and Gail Kim. Co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin later explained to Eric Bischoff that he had rehired Lita. Lita and Stratus went on to defeat Holly and Kim in a tag team match on September 21 at Unforgiven. Lita feuded with Holly into late 2003, unsuccessfully challenging her for the Women&#x27;s Championship on November 16 at Survivor Series. On the November 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita and Matt Hardy were reunited after Hardy was moved from &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to &quot;Raw&quot;. Continuing the storyline, Holly interrupted as Hardy was about to propose to Lita, challenging the duo to face her and Bischoff in an intergender tag team match later that evening. Bischoff later added the stipulation that Lita would earn a title shot if she won but would be fired if she lost. Hardy and Lita lost the match after Hardy refused to tag in, with Hardy berating Lita for &quot;selfishly&quot; returning to &quot;Raw&quot; instead of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, claiming that this showed that she cared more about the Women&#x27;s Championship than about him. Lita was rehired later that evening when Christian informed her that he had used his Survivor Series favor to get Bischoff to reinstate her. One week later, Lita lost to Victoria in the first ever women&#x27;s steel cage match in WWE history, due to interference from Hardy.

As Lita and Christian appeared to be developing an on-screen relationship, so did Stratus and Chris Jericho. Subsequently, Stratus and Lita participated in an intergender tag team match as partners on the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. After the match, Stratus overheard Jericho talking to then-heel, Christian, about who could sleep with their respective woman first. One week later, Stratus and Lita confronted the men about their real intentions, leading to a feud between the two men and women which resulted in a &quot;Battle of the Sexes&quot; match at Armageddon, which the women lost. A rematch ended in a no contest the next night. On February 23, 2004, Lita was involved in a fatal-4-way elimination match for the Women&#x27;s Championship which also included Molly Holly, Jazz, and Victoria, who won the match.

==== Storyline with Kane and feud with Trish Stratus (2004–2005) ====
Lita competed in the women&#x27;s division throughout early 2004, winning a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Women&#x27;s Championship on the April 5 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Victoria defeated Lita to retain the Women&#x27;s Championship at Backlash on April 18. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita was reunited with Matt Hardy when Hardy attacked Kane in an attempt to prevent him from harming Lita, beginning a new storyline involving the trio. In the following weeks, Kane began repeatedly assaulting Hardy and attempting to seduce Lita. During the course of the storyline, he kidnapped Lita and held her tied up backstage, and he persuaded Eric Bischoff to give her a title shot at Bad Blood on June 13, where she was defeated by Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four Way match that also included Gail Kim and defending champion Victoria. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita revealed that she was pregnant. One week later, it appeared that Hardy was going to propose to Lita, but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of Lita&#x27;s child. Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, in fact, the father. Hardy and Kane feuded for several months, culminating in a &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; match on August 15 at SummerSlam, with the stipulation that Lita would be obliged to marry the winner of the match. Kane won the match, leading to he and a reluctant Lita marrying one another on the August 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Despite being married to Kane, Lita thwarted him during his matches, constantly aiding his opponents. On the September 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita miscarried after Gene Snitsky struck Kane with a chair, resulting in him falling on Lita. The miscarriage led to Lita and Kane joining forces in order to take revenge on Snitsky.

With her pregnancy storyline over, Lita returned to the women&#x27;s division in November 2004. She began a feud with Trish Stratus, who had constantly degraded her during her pregnancy storyline. When Stratus referred to her as &quot;chubby&quot; because of her weight gain, she retaliated by attacking Stratus backstage. Lita challenged Stratus to a Women&#x27;s Championship match at Survivor Series, however, due to the months of humiliation and being verbally berated by Stratus, Lita was more concerned with doing as much damage as possible—she broke Stratus&#x27;s nose and attacked her with a steel chair, promptly leading to her disqualification. This intense and violent match involved levels of physicality that had not been seen before in the women&#x27;s division. The feud raged on, and on December 6, Lita defeated Stratus in the main event of &quot;Raw&quot; to win her second WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. During the course of the match, Lita botched a suicide dive to the outside when she over-rotated by a fraction of an inch, barely escaping serious injury. This move was later used in the buildup to the title rematch she was booked for at New Year&#x27;s Revolution against Stratus, who claimed, &quot;Lita had to practically kill herself just to beat me.&quot; During the match, Lita legitimately tore her left ACL after executing a Thesz press off the ring apron, leaving her unable to continue the match and resulting in a rushed finish, in which Stratus reclaimed the title.

Lita returned to WWE television in March 2005, mentoring Christy Hemme, who was in the midst of a storyline with Stratus that featured a title match between them at WrestleMania 21. Despite Lita&#x27;s coaching, Hemme was defeated by Stratus. Lita continued to feud with Stratus by proxy over the following weeks, with Kane defeating Stratus&#x27;s companion, Viscera, at Backlash on May 1.

==== Relationship with Edge and first retirement (2005–2006) ====

The relationship between Lita and Kane lasted until the May 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, when Lita turned on Kane, helping Edge defeat him in the finals of the &quot;Raw&quot; Gold Rush Tournament, turning heel for the first and only time in her career. On the May 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita announced that she had filed for divorce, claiming Kane was like a 4th grader in the bedroom and expressing relief that she would no longer have to deal with his &quot;sweaty body&quot; and &quot;stupid little laugh,&quot; and his wedding ring being flushed down a toilet. She then attempted to marry Edge on the June 20 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but the marriage ceremony was interrupted by a vengeful Kane, who emerged from beneath the ring, destroyed the ceremony, and as Edge and Lita escaped from the ring, Kane tombstoned their priest. The storyline with Kane ended shortly thereafter.

Off-screen, at this time, Dumas had been involved with Matt Hardy romantically, but began an affair with Adam Copeland (Edge), who was one of Hardy&#x27;s closest friends. WWE then began to use the real-life issues between the three as an on-screen storyline. In April, Hardy was released from WWE for revealing the entire incident on his blog, only to be rehired several months later under constant outcry from fans from shows and pay-per-views every week for months on end. Lita had been one of the most popular performers in the WWE since the beginning of her association with the Hardy Boyz in 2000 and after Hardy was fired in April, her popularity had taken a massive dive. Starting with a &quot;Raw&quot; event at Madison Square Garden where after hobbling to the ring on a crutch to do a segment with heel Trish Stratus, she was booed heavily and fans chanted &quot;You screwed Matt!&quot; and &quot;We want Matt!&quot;- and Lita was still a face at this time. The booing and jeering got so bad that Stratus, angered by the abuse, went off script and berated the crowd; after the segment Dumas was shaken by the experience. Hardy was rehired in July (by which time Lita had turned heel) and would engage in a three-month feud with Edge, while Lita, awkwardly watching and sometimes interfering in these matches from ringside continued to act as Edge&#x27;s valet. On the October 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge, with the assistance of Lita, defeated Hardy in a ladder match, and Hardy was obligated to leave &quot;Raw&quot; as a stipulation of the match, ending their feud. Hardy went to &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, and Edge defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship on January 8 at New Year&#x27;s Revolution.
In an interview conducted after the event, on WWE.com, Edge announced that he and Lita would have &quot;hot, unbridled sex&quot; in the middle of the ring on &quot;Raw&quot; the following night to celebrate his victory. On &quot;Raw&quot; that night in the family-friendly amusement park town of Hershey, Pennsylvania, Edge held up to that promise by engaging in foreplay with Lita in a bed inside the ring until they were interrupted by Ric Flair, who called Edge a disgrace and &quot;that he was horrible in the sack.&quot; Flair, however, ended up on the receiving end of a con-chair-to on the announcers&#x27; table until Cena came out to Flair&#x27;s aid and performed an FU on Lita. The &quot;Live Sex Celebration&quot; segment earned &quot;Raw&quot; a 5.2 rating, the highest &quot;Raw&quot; rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the &quot;most watched champion ever&quot;. In 2021, Lita revealed that she was uncomfortable with the segment, but WWE threatened to fire her if she didn&#x27;t do the segment. On the February 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita teamed with Edge in a loss to Cena and Maria. She continued to manage Edge into mid-2006, frequently interfering on his behalf during his feud with Mick Foley. In May 2006, Foley joined forces with Edge and Lita, with the trio defeating Foley&#x27;s ECW rivals Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer, and Beulah McGillicutty in an impromptu six-person tag team match at One Night Stand.

On the August 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita won her third Women&#x27;s Championship by defeating Mickie James. She lost the title to longtime rival, Trish Stratus, at Unforgiven in Stratus&#x27;s retirement match. At Cyber Sunday, Lita defeated James again in the finals of a tournament for the vacant Women&#x27;s Title in a lumberjill match. In the three editions of &quot;Raw&quot; after Cyber Sunday, Lita faced James in three non-title handicap matches, the first where James had one hand tied behind her back, the second where James had her feet tied together, and the third with James being blindfolded. Lita easily won the first (November 6) and third (November 20) of those matches, but on the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, James was able to defeat Lita after D-Generation X squirted mustard in Lita&#x27;s face. By this time, Lita had become so fed up with the continued negative intrusion for 18 consecutive months WWE fans had on her personal life, that she cut a series of intense promos, with the normally relaxed Lita yelling and screaming into the microphone over her intense frustration of being treated the way she had been treated, insulting the crowd and the millions watching on TV. At Survivor Series, Lita had her last match before her retirement, where she lost the title against Mickie James.

=== Return to the independent circuit (2007, 2017) ===
Dumas made her debut for United Wrestling Federation (UWF) on April 21, 2007, where she served as a special guest referee for the match between Christy Hemme and April Hunter. The following day, Dumas made her in-ring debut teaming up with Jerry Lynn in a winning effort defeating Austin Starr and Christy Hemme. Dumas made her debut for Family Wrestling Entertainment on the April 28 episode of &quot;FWE Television&quot;, as a special guest referee for the match where Winter retained the FWE Women&#x27;s Championship against Melina Perez.

Lita made her in-ring return for the first time in five years as part of an eight-person tag match for MCW Pro Wrestling in Joppa, Maryland on March 3, 2017, where she teamed with The Bruiser, and The Hell Cats to defeat MCW champion Sean Studd, Andy Vineberg, Rayo and Jeremiah.

=== Return to World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE (2007–present) ===

==== Sporadic appearances (2007–2012) ====
Lita returned on December 10, 2007, on &quot;Raw&#x27;s 15th Anniversary Special&quot; by teaming up with Trish Stratus to rid the ring of Jillian Hall, turning face. Later that night, she had a backstage reunion with Kane, her former on-screen husband.

She appeared on the November 1, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a segment with Pee-wee Herman. On December 12, 2011, Lita presented a Slammy Award to Kelly Kelly for Divalicious Moment of the Year.

Lita returned on the 1000th episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on July 23, 2012, defeating Heath Slater in an intergender no disqualification, no countout match with the help from the WWE legends who had defeated Slater during the past weeks, as well as the APA.

==== WWE Hall of Famer and various roles (2014–2018) ====
In 2014, she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by her best friend and fellow wrestler Trish Stratus. The next night at WrestleMania XXX, she appeared during transmission while she was introduced as part of the 2014 Hall of Fame class.
Lita served as a trainer on the sixth season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, alongside Booker T and Billy Gunn. She appeared on the July 13, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to introduce the &quot;Tough Enough&quot; contestants. From October 2015 to July 2016, Dumas was a creative writer and backstage producer for the WWE on a full-time basis.

During the WrestleMania 32 pre-show on April 3, 2016, Lita announced the retirement of the WWE Divas Championship and unveiled the new WWE Women&#x27;s Championship belt, being won by Charlotte. She was working as one of the pre-show hosts for &quot;Raw&quot;, &quot;SmackDown&quot; and pay-per-view events until 2017.

Lita appeared during the WrestleMania 33 pre-show on April 2, 2017. She was also color commentator for the first edition of the Mae Young Classic, alongside Jim Ross.

Lita participated in the first edition of the Women&#x27;s Royal Rumble in 2018. She also wrestled at WWE Evolution, WWE&#x27;s first all women&#x27;s pay-per-view, where she and Trish Stratus defeated Mickie James and Alicia Fox following a brief feud.

==== Return and WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Champion (2022–2023) ====
Ahead of her appearance in the 2022 edition of the Royal Rumble, Lita returned to &quot;SmackDown&quot;, as a face, which led to a confrontation with Charlotte Flair. At the event, Lita entered at #26 and eliminated former rival Mickie James before being eliminated by Flair. On January 31, 2022, on &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita challenged Becky Lynch to a match at Elimination Chamber for the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship. At the event on February 19, Lita failed to win the title, but received a standing ovation after the match.

Ending a one-year hiatus, Lita returned to &quot;Raw&quot; on February 6, 2023, during a Steel Cage match between Lynch and Bayley. She proceeded to assault all three members of Damage CTRL (Bayley, Dakota Kai, and Iyo Sky) and giving Lynch the victory. On the February 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Lita would team with Lynch to defeat Kai and Sky for the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship after an assist from the returning Trish Stratus, giving Lita her first title reign since 2006. On March 6, Stratus, Lynch, and Lita challenged Damage CTRL to a six-woman tag team match at WrestleMania 39, where they were victorious. This was Lita&#x27;s second WrestleMania match and first-ever win.

On April 10, 2023, Lita was scheduled to defend the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship on &quot;Raw&quot; against Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez. However, Lita was assaulted just prior to the start of the show, with Trish Stratus teaming with Becky Lynch to defend the title on her behalf. Morgan pinned Stratus with a roll-up, costing Lita and Lynch the titles. Stratus then attacked Lynch following the match. On the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Stratus revealed herself as Lita&#x27;s attacker, citing frustration with Lita appearing as Lynch&#x27;s sidekick and overall anger at her legacy seemingly being forgotten.

On the November 14, 2023, episode of NXT, Lita announced the qualifiers for the Iron Survivor Challenge at NXT Deadline.

== Legacy ==
Lita is cited as inspiration for several women, such as Paige, AJ Lee, Bayley, Liv Morgan, Deonna Purrazzo, Melina Perez, Taryn Terrell, Maria Kanellis, and Maryse.

Lita was involved in the first three &quot;Raw&quot; main events featuring women. She won all three matches—the first on July 31, 2000, in Atlanta being a mixed tag-team match pairing her and The Rock against Trish Stratus and Triple H, the second against Stephanie McMahon on August 21, 2000, with The Rock as the special guest referee in which she captured her first Women&#x27;s Championship, and the third against Trish Stratus on December 6, 2004, where she won her second Women&#x27;s Championship. This was the first time women had main-evented &quot;Raw&quot; where no men were involved in any capacity. In November 2003, she faced Victoria in the first-ever women&#x27;s steel cage match in WWE.

WWE mentions Lita as &quot;a Diva who always kept the WWE Universe on their toes. Whether she was flying high with The Hardy Boyz or shocking censors alongside Edge, the four-time Women&#x27;s Champion knew how to elicit a reaction around the world.&quot;

Her Women&#x27;s Championship match against Trish Stratus at Unforgiven 2006 was ranked No. 3 by WWE in 2015 on the &quot;10 greatest Divas Matches of all time&quot; list. This match is also cited as one of the most unforgettable Divas matches, along with her match against Mickie James at Survivor Series 2006, and against Victoria in a cage match on &quot;Raw&quot;.

== Music career ==

Dumas formed the band The Luchagors in mid-2006, and they debuted in September 2006 at the rock and wrestling event Rock-N-Shock at The Masquerade in Atlanta. Dumas wore a top emblazoned with the symbol of the band during her final match in WWE. The band released their self-titled debut CD, &quot;The Luchagors&quot;, on September 11, 2007.

Dumas contributed vocals to the song &quot;From The Shadows&quot; (appearing on the track alongside Dez Cadena of Black Flag/Misfits) from &quot;Recognise&quot;, the debut album from UK band JD &amp; the FDCs, which was released in July 2012. A video for the song was released in March 2013.

== Other media ==

Lita was featured in the June 2001 video and DVD release &quot;Lita: It Just Feels Right&quot;. The video featured discussions of Lita&#x27;s career to that point and showcased several of her matches. Dumas&#x27;s autobiography, written with Michael Krugman, &quot;Lita: A Less Traveled R.O.A.D. – The Reality of Amy Dumas&quot; was released on September 16, 2003. The book covered topics such as her family, childhood years, wrestling career, relationship with Matt Hardy, and her neck surgery and subsequent rehabilitation. Lita is considered to be a sex symbol.

Dumas also appeared on a variety of television shows including &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, and &quot;The Weakest Link&#x27;s&quot; &quot;WWF Superstars Edition&quot; in 2002. In 2004, she appeared on an episode of &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

Lita began hosting a local Atlanta radio show called &quot;Amy&#x27;s Discordia&quot; in 2013.

Lita was interviewed and profiled for the 2016 &quot;Nine Legends&quot; movie.

On May 9, 2018, Dumas debuted as the host of a series for the ASY TV web platform titled &quot;The UFO Sho&quot; where she visits UFO-themed locations and examines the culture around them.

In 2019, Dumas appeared on &quot;The Special Without Brett Davis&quot; during WrestleMania week.

In March 2020, Dumas, along with Christy Hemme and Gail Kim, announced &quot;KAYfABE,&quot; a new wrestling show which was inspired by true events and was to blend scripted drama with pro wrestling. The production launched a crowd-funding campaign on Kickstarter to raise money for the pilot episode, however they were only able to raise $62,919.96 of the $400,000 goal. Following the failure of the campaign, the team cited the financial impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for the campaign&#x27;s difficulties and assured fans that the show would secure funding elsewhere at a later date.

On November 18, 2020, Lita made an appearance on a TV show along with Tatiana Suarez of the UFC on &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;.

Lita also joined Booker T and Mick Foley as a co-host of WWE Studios&#x27; A&amp;E reality series &quot;WWE&#x27;s Most Wanted Treasures&quot; about searches for collectibles related to various wrestlers for its second season in 2023.

== Video games ==
== Personal life ==
Dumas had breast augmentation surgery in late 1999. Dumas is a known animal lover and vegan. In 2003, she founded the animal charity Amy Dumas Operation Rescue and Education (A.D.O.R.E.).

Dumas&#x27;s hair is naturally brown, although she has dyed it red throughout her WWF/E career. She has a wide variety of tattoos: a three-eyed green gargoyle on her upper right bicep, the word &quot;Punk&quot; on the inside of her lower lip, and the word &quot;rebel&quot; () written in Russian Cyrillic letters on her lower back neck, all of which she got in the 1990s. In 2007, she acquired a sleeve on her left arm, featuring Mexican skulls, one of which has the band 7 Seconds&#x27; logo on its forehead. She previously had two piercings in her tongue and another two in her nose.

In 1999, Dumas began dating Matt Hardy. They first met in January 1999 at a NWA Mid-Atlantic show, and began dating a few months later. In February 2005, it was revealed that Dumas had been romantically involved with fellow wrestler Adam Copeland for several months while still in a relationship with Hardy, who had been at home recovering from a knee injury. Following a public revelation of the affair, Matt Hardy was released by WWE. Hardy was rehired several months later and the real-life situation was translated into a storyline.

Dumas dated fellow band member Shane Morton from 2006 to 2008. Dumas also dated CM Punk from 2009 to 2010, and then again from late 2012 to September 2013.

After retiring from wrestling in 2009, Dumas bought a house in Nicaragua and splits her time between her home in Atlanta and her house in Nicaragua, where she enjoys surfing.

Dumas was arrested on December 9, 2011, in Columbia County, Georgia, for speeding and driving with a suspended license. After one night in jail, Dumas was released on a bail bond posted at $2,200.

<text>In finance, the strike price (or exercise price) of an option is a fixed price at which the owner of the option can buy (in the case of a call), or sell (in the case of a put), the underlying security or commodity. The strike price may be set by reference to the spot price, which is the market price of the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out. Alternatively, the strike price may be fixed at a discount or premium.

The strike price is a key variable in a derivatives contract between two parties. Where the contract requires delivery of the underlying instrument, the trade will be at the strike price, regardless of the market price of the underlying instrument at that time.

==Moneyness==
Moneyness is the value of a financial contract if the contract settlement is financial. More specifically, it is the difference between the strike price of the option and the current trading price of its underlying security.

In options trading, terms such as &quot;in-the-money&quot;, &quot;at-the-money&quot; and &quot;out-of-the-money&quot; describe the moneyness of options.

* A call option is in-the-money if the strike price is below the market price of the underlying stock.
* A put option is in-the-money if the strike price is above the market price of the underlying stock.
* A call or put option is at-the-money if the stock price and the exercise price are the same (or close).
* A call option is out-of-the-money if the strike price is above the market price of the underlying stock.
* A put option is out-of-the-money if the strike price is below the market price of the underlying stock.

===Mathematical formula===
A call option has positive monetary value at expiration when the underlying has a spot price (S) &quot;above&quot; the strike price (K). Since the option will not be exercised unless it is in-the-money, the payoff for a call option is

:formula_1

also written as
:formula_2

where
:formula_3

A put option has positive monetary value at expiration when the underlying has a spot price &quot;below&quot; the strike price; it is &quot;out-the-money&quot; otherwise, and will not be exercised. The payoff is therefore:
:formula_4
or
:formula_5

For a digital option payoff is formula_6, where formula_7 is the indicator function:

<doc id="240733" wikidata="Q1050530" url="?curid=240733" title="Tic Tac">
<text>Tic Tac (stylized in lowercase) is a brand of small, hard mint manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero. They were first produced in 1969 and are now available in a variety of flavors in over 100 countries.

Tic Tacs are typically sold in small transparent plastic boxes with a flip-action living hinge lid. Originally, Tic Tacs were dyed specific colours for different flavours, although in many countries the transparent plastic boxes are now coloured while the Tic Tacs themselves are white.

Tic Tac has featured advertising that emphasizes the low calorie count of the mints. Most flavors have approximately 1.9 calories per mint.

== History ==

Tic Tac were first introduced by Ferrero in 1969, under the name &quot;Refreshing Mints&quot;. In 1970, the name was changed to Tic Tac, after the distinctive clicking sound made by the pack being opened and closed. Besides the original mint and orange flavours, several new varieties were added, including aniseed, cinnamon (or &quot;Winter Warmer&quot;), an orange and lime mix (in 1976), spearmint, peppermint, Powermint, sour apple, mandarin, tangerine, berry, fresh orange, strawberry, wintergreen, pink grapefruit, orange and lime together (in 1978), cherry, passionfruit (in 2007), pomegranate (in 2010), mango, lime, and popcorn (2014). The grape flavour was eliminated in 1976 because of health concerns about the red dye amaranth (FD&amp;C Red #2), a suspected carcinogen.

Other offerings have included holiday gift packs for Christmas, Easter, St Patricks Day, and Valentine&#x27;s Day.
Since 1980, the Tic Tac slogan in the United States has been &quot;The 1½ Calorie Breath Mint.&quot; In the United Kingdom, France, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Australia, Tic Tacs are noted as being less than two calories with the slogan &quot;Two hours of Tic Tac freshness in less than two calories.&quot; In Canada, New Zealand and Australia, and used once in the United States, the Tic Tac slogan is &quot;It&#x27;s not just a mint, it&#x27;s a Tic Tac.&quot; In India, the Tic Tac slogan is &quot;Refreshment to be shared.&quot;

During the 1990s, &quot;double packs&quot; were introduced, featuring a regular Tic Tac container with two flavours inside. Available combinations included Tangerine and Lime, Orange and Grape, and Berry and Cherry.

In 2006, Tic Tac introduced a &quot;Bold&quot; edition with more intense flavours of Mint and Fruit.

In 2008, Tic Tac introduced &quot;Tic Tac Chill,&quot; which is slightly larger than ordinary Tic Tacs and comes in a dual-opening packaging, using the traditional living hinge or a sliding opening on the front of the case. These come in three flavours: Exotic Cherry, Berry Blast, and Paradise Mint. Tic Tac Chill mints are also sugar-free, the Exotic Cherry ones instead being sweetened with xylitol.

During May 2010, Australia&#x27;s Trademark Registrar office rejected Ferrero&#x27;s application to trademark their Tic Tac container as &quot;not being unique enough to distinguish its products from other manufacturers.&quot;

Tic Tac sometimes provides limited editions to promote films and television shows, such as a banana and mandarin flavour for the 2015 movie &quot;Minions&quot;. Orange Tic Tacs featured prominently in the 2007 film &quot;Juno&quot;, in an orange box with white colour mints as sold in Canada and Brazil. Film promoters distributed boxes of the mints prior to the film&#x27;s release. The Simpsons were also a part of a marketing campaign with four different flavors featuring custom The Simpsons labeling; Blueberry, Bubblegum, Buzz Cola, and Donut. Tic Tac introduced a limited edition Coca-Cola flavour in 2020, and Sprite in 2023.

== Manufacturing ==
Thirty-five percent of the world&#x27;s Tic Tacs are manufactured at the Ferrero factory in Cork, Ireland.

Tic Tacs are also manufactured in Australia, Canada, India and Ecuador.

== Nutrition facts ==

Each pack weighs and contains about 38 Tic Tacs. New packs in Australia and Canada weigh 24 g and contain 50 Tic Tacs, and the Tic Tac &quot;100 pack&quot; weighs 49 g and contains 100 Tic Tacs. The &quot;Big Pack&quot; weighs 29 g and contains 60 Tic Tacs. The &quot;Bottle Pack&quot; weighs 98g and contains 200 Tic Tacs. In the UK packs are and contain 22 Tic Tacs.

In the United States, the sugar content of Tic Tacs is listed as 0 g despite the mints being approximately 90% sugar (depending on the flavor). This stems from the fact that a serving size is one 0.49 g mint, and the American Food and Drug Administration permits manufacturers to list sugar (or other nutritional components) as 0 g if they contain less than 0.5 g. In at least some jurisdictions, the 0 g now features a footnote that clarifies &quot;less than 0.5 g&quot;.

<doc id="240739" wikidata="Q708185" url="?curid=240739" title="Riddick Bowe">
<text>Riddick Lamont Bowe (born August 10, 1967) is an American former professional boxer and professional kickboxer who competed between 1989 and 2008 in boxing, and from 2013 to 2016 in kickboxing (Muay Thai). He held the undisputed world heavyweight championship in 1992, and won the super heavyweight silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

After turning professional in 1989, Bowe went on to become a two-time world heavyweight champion. In 1992 he became the undisputed heavyweight champion by winning the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC) and International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles by defeating then-unbeaten former undisputed cruiserweight champion Evander Holyfield. That same year, Bowe was named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine and the Boxing Writers&#x27; Association of America. Bowe vacated the WBC title later that year in protest, instead of defending the title against their number one contender, Lennox Lewis. This left the undisputed championship fragmented until 1999. In a rematch with Holyfield in 1993, Bowe narrowly lost the WBA and IBF titles in what would be his only professional defeat.

Bowe later regained a portion of the world heavyweight championship in 1995, defeating Herbie Hide for the World Boxing Organization (WBO) title. In doing so, Bowe became the first boxer in history to win the titles of all four major sanctioning bodies: the WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO. Later that year, Bowe vacated the WBO title in order to fight Holyfield for a third time, and won decisively by being the first boxer to defeat Holyfield by knockout. 1996 saw Bowe engage in two brutal slugfests with Andrew Golota, both of which ended controversially when Golota repeatedly hit him with low blows.

Bowe retired from boxing after the Golota fights, making low-key comebacks in 2004 and 2008. In a 2010 article by Boxing Scene, Bowe was ranked the 21st greatest heavyweight of all time. In 2015, he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. As of 2024, Bowe remains the last American undisputed world heavyweight champion.

==Early life==
Bowe was born on August 10, 1967, the twelfth of his mother Dorothy Bowe&#x27;s thirteen children. Bowe was born and raised in the East New York section of Brooklyn, New York City. His brother Henry died of AIDS, and his sister Brenda was stabbed to death by a drug addict during an attempted robbery.

Bowe was in the same elementary school sixth-grade class with Mike Tyson. &quot;We went to school together in the sixth grade in P.S. 396 (in Brownsville.) I really didn&#x27;t know him,&quot; Bowe recalled.

==Amateur boxing career==
Bowe was training at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Boxing Association Gym or the &quot;Bed-Stuy BA&quot; for short. As an amateur, Bowe won the prestigious New York Golden Gloves Championship and other tournaments. In 1984, age 17, he knocked out opponent James Smith in just 4 seconds. In 1985, at the National Golden Gloves championships, he lost to Fort Worth heavyweight Donald Stephens. Apart from boxing he attended Kingsborough Community College, where he studied drama — in hopes of an acting career after boxing — also he took up a business administration study.

His friends called him &quot;Don King&quot; because of his hairstyle. Bowe said he was emulating Mark Breland, &quot;I got a majority of my experience with Mark, I&#x27;m inspired by what he&#x27;s accomplished. It makes it possible for me to do the same,&quot; said Bowe in an interview.

===New York Golden Gloves Championships===
Bowe won four New York Golden Gloves Championships. He won two bouts as a 178-pounder in 1984 before failing to show for a third bout. He won the 1985 178 lb Novice Championship, 1986 178 lb Open Championship and the 1987 and 1988 Super Heavyweight Open Championship. Already in 1985 Bowe was ranked #1 light heavyweight in the United States.

===1986 Goodwill Games===
He was a light heavyweight runner-up for the 1986 World Championships and 1986 Goodwill Games but for some reason didn&#x27;t qualify. Meanwhile, during the year-and-a-half hiatus he gained well above thirty pounds and jumped from light heavyweight to super heavyweight, coming back for the 1987 United States Olympic Festival.

===1987 Pan Am===
Prior to 1987 Pan American Games, Bowe said he had suffered a hairline fracture in his right hand during one of his two fights at the Olympic Festival in July 1987. The injury, he said, was revealed in X-rays he had taken at home. Roosevelt Sanders, the head coach, said he was aware that Bowe&#x27;s hand was being treated, but had not known it was broken. Bowe said he kept those injuries secret from the U.S. team coaching staff for fear of being kept out of the tournament.

===Olympic qualifiers===
At first, Bowe was dismissed from the Olympic-year training camp, because U.S. Olympic boxing Coach Ken Adams didn&#x27;t like him.
U.S. Army superheavyweight Robert Salters, a Brooklyn-born 25-year-old artilleryman of Fort Bragg, NC, who took up boxing in 1986, and had less than twenty amateur fights in his 16-months-long record before they first met at the 1988 AAU National finals, where Salters floored Bowe twice before ref stopped the fight, became a real nemesis for Bowe during his amateur career, as they fought each other to nearly a draw in the 1988 Olympic Box-offs at Caesars Palace, after Bowe lost to Salters in the Olympic Trials (Bowe came in at 231 lbs, Salters at 247.). &quot;He was talking&#x27; trash about me, and that helped me mentally,&quot; Salters said. Bowe had been boxing reportedly with ligament damage on the middle knuckle of his right hand, which he got the day before the Box-offs, and with a damaged right ankle, eventually managed to win, for the judges had to pick up a winner despite the even 58–58 score. The fifth unidentified judge, who scored the bout 58–58, gave it to Bowe on unidentified subjective grounds. Despite giving Bowe a hard time on four occasions in a row, Salters never turned pro.

===1988 Olympics===
Bowe won the silver medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, outpointing Soviet Alex Miroshnichenko in the semifinals, and losing a controversial match in the finals to future world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Bowe had a dominant first round, landing 33 of 94 punches thrown (34%) while Lewis landed 14 of 67 (21%). In the first round the referee from East Germany gave Bowe two cautions for headbutts and deducted a point for a third headbutt, although replay clearly showed there was no headbutt. Commentator Ferdie Pacheco disagreed with the deduction, saying they did not hit heads. In the second round, Lewis landed several hard punches. The referee gave Bowe two standing eight counts and waved the fight off after the second one, even though Bowe seemed able to continue. Pacheco disagreed with the stoppage, calling it &quot;very strange,&quot; but Marv Albert said Bowe took &quot;a pounding.&quot;

Bowe finished his amateur career with a record of 104 wins, 18 losses.

==Professional boxing career==
Bowe turned professional after his Olympic loss. Highly regarded trainer Eddie Futch took on the job of developing Bowe, as he saw the talent. Eddie would say that Bowe had more potential than any boxer he had ever trained.

Bowe turned professional in March 1989 and knocked out Lionel Butler. His then manager, Rock Newman, kept Bowe active, fighting 13 times in 1989, beating journeymen — the most notable being Garing Lane, whom he beat twice. In September 1990, Bowe made his first step up in class, fighting faded ex-champion Pinklon Thomas, whom he dominated until Thomas gave up after eight rounds. The following month, Bowe knocked out Bert Cooper in two rounds, which added to his reputation and high ranking.

In March 1991, Bowe knocked out 1984 Olympic Super Heavyweight Gold medalist Tyrell Biggs. In Bowe&#x27;s next fight, ex-champion Tony Tubbs appeared to outbox and outsmart Bowe in a close bout, only to have the judges award Bowe a unanimous decision. In August 1991, Bowe knocked out future world heavyweight champion Bruce Seldon in one round. 

===Fights against Elijah Tillery===
Bowe fought two interesting bouts against Elijah Tillery in 1991. Their first fight, at the Washington Convention Center, drew attention for its bizarre conclusion. Bowe dominated the first round and dropped Tillery. After the round ended, Tillery walked toward Bowe and taunted him, and Bowe responded by punching Tillery. Tillery then threw several low kicks at Bowe, who then unleashed a flurry of punches on Tillery as he lay on the ropes. Bowe&#x27;s trainer Rock Newman grabbed Tillery from behind on the ring apron and pulled him over the ropes as Bowe continued to throw punches. Tillery somersaulted over the ropes, and was quickly detained by security. After order was restored and the fighters returned to the ring, Tillery and Bowe continued a war of words, and minor incidents continued until the ring was cleared. Tillery was controversially disqualified for kicking Bowe, with Bowe getting the win, much to the surprise of the television announcers. The referee, Karl Milligan, had stepped between the two fighters to separate them and stepped forward as he did so, inadvertently missing the action behind him after the bell between the combatants. The fighters fought a rematch two months later at Convention Hall in Atlantic City, with Bowe dominating and stopping Tillery in four rounds.

===Bowe vs. Coetzer===

In July 1992, he knocked out South African Pierre Coetzer in the seventh round of a WBA heavyweight title eliminator. The victory made him the mandatory challenger to undisputed heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield.

===World heavyweight champion===

In November 1992 he fought reigning champ Evander Holyfield for the undisputed heavyweight title. Bowe won a unanimous decision in an entertaining fight, flooring Holyfield in the 11th round. However, it was the tenth round most boxing fans will remember. The epic brutal back and forth exchanges helped make it Ring Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Round of the Year.&quot; Commentator Al Bernstein exclaimed, &quot;That was one of the greatest rounds in heavyweight history. Period!&quot;

A couple of weeks earlier in London, Bowe&#x27;s old Olympic rival, Lennox Lewis, knocked out Canadian Donovan &quot;Razor&quot; Ruddock in two rounds, establishing himself as the World Boxing Council&#x27;s number one contender. The Bowe-Holyfield and Lewis-Ruddock fights were part of a mini-tournament, whereby all four fighters agreed the two winners would meet each other for the undisputed world heavyweight championship. Bowe&#x27;s manager Rock Newman made a proposal: the $32 million purse HBO was offering should be split 90–10 in Bowe&#x27;s favor, an &#x27;absurd&#x27; offer which Lennox Lewis rejected. Lewis&#x27;s manager, Kellie Maloney (known as Frank Maloney at the time), rejected another offer of two million for Lewis to fight on a Bowe undercard, citing his distrust of the Bowe camp after the aforementioned financial negotiations. Bowe responded by holding a press conference in which he dumped the WBC world heavyweight championship belt into a trash can and relinquished it in order to protest the actions of the WBC and WBC President José Sulaimán concerning the fight payoff.

Bowe&#x27;s first defense of his remaining titles came on February 6, 1993, when he fought 34-year-old former champion Michael Dokes at Madison Square Garden and knocked him out in the first round. In February 1993, Bowe met Pope John Paul II during the pope&#x27;s general audience at the Vatican, a day after Bowe completed a goodwill mission to Somalia. In Bowe&#x27;s next fight, May 22, 1993, at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Bowe knocked out Jesse Ferguson in the second round to retain the title. This set up a rematch with Evander Holyfield.

In the rematch with Holyfield, Bowe looked overweight. He had entered training camp at 266 lbs and weighed in at 246 lbs, eleven pounds heavier than in the first fight with Holyfield.

Bowe and Holyfield exchanged hard punches. Bowe ended up losing the belts to Holyfield by a majority decision. This fight was also known for a bizarre stunt in which parachutist James &quot;Fan Man&quot; Miller dropped into the open air arena, landing in the ropes by Bowe&#x27;s corner. This surreal scene delayed the fight in the seventh round by nearly a half-hour. Bowe stated afterwards he thought the bout should have declared a &#x27;technical draw&#x27; or a &#x27;no contest&#x27; owing to the unfair delay.

===After title loss===

In August 1994, Bowe fought two comeback fights. He faced the much smaller Buster Mathis Jr and, after struggling to connect with his bobbing and weaving target, hit Mathis while he was down with what was ruled an accidental blow, and the bout was ruled a &#x27;No Contest&#x27; by referee Arthur Mercante, Sr. In December 1994, Bowe punched Larry Donald at a prefight press conference, later beating him by 12 round unanimous decision for the WBC Continental Americas Heavyweight title, giving the 16-0 heavyweight contender Donald his first loss.

===WBO heavyweight champion and Holyfield rubber match===

In March 1995, Bowe won the WBO version of the world heavyweight championship by knocking down England&#x27;s Herbie Hide six times en route to scoring a sixth-round knockout.

In June 1995, after a heated build up, Bowe defended the WBO heavyweight title against his archrival in the amateurs, Jorge Luis González, At the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The prefight hype contained bizarre trash talk, which included Gonzalez declaring a desire to eat Bowe&#x27;s heart and likening himself to a lion while making Bowe out to be a hyena. Bowe won by sixth-round knockout over Gonzalez. He vacated the WBO championship soon after.
After the Gonzales fight, Bowe fought a rubber match with Evander Holyfield, their third and final meeting. Holyfield knocked Bowe down during the fight, but Bowe maintained his composure, and persevered to score an eighth round stoppage victory.

On January 11, 1996 Bowe was officially no longer the WBO champion.

===Bowe vs. Golota I and II===

After defeating Holyfield in the third bout of their trilogy, Bowe was matched against undefeated heavyweight contender Andrew Golota at the Madison Square Garden in an HBO Boxing event. Bowe&#x27;s weight problem again resurfaced, as the favorite entered the ring at a career high of 252 lbs. Though ahead on points, Golota was penalized several times for low blows to the testes, and was finally disqualified in the seventh round after a combination of punches to Bowe&#x27;s testicles. Seconds after Golota was disqualified, Bowe&#x27;s entourage rushed the ring, attacked Golota with a two way radio (Golota traded punches with one of them, requiring 11 stitches to close the wound caused by the radio) and assaulted Golota&#x27;s 74-year-old trainer Lou Duva, who collapsed in the ring and was taken out of The Garden on a stretcher. The entourage began rioting, fighting with spectators, staff and policemen alike, resulting in a number of injuries before they were forced out of the arena in what evolved into a lengthy televised ring spectacle.

The fight made many sports shows, including &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, and there was a good amount of public interest in a rematch. The rematch was on Pay Per View. Golota, after dropping Bowe in the second round, and being dropped himself later, was leading on the scorecards, only to be disqualified in the ninth round, once again for deliberately punching Bowe repeatedly in the testes. Despite not having another riot, this fight also proved to be controversial, with an unsuccessful protest filed by Golota&#x27;s camp to try to overturn the fight&#x27;s result.

This fight was featured on HBO&#x27;s documentary &quot;Legendary Nights: The Tale of Bowe-Golota&quot;.

===Return to boxing===

On September 25, 2004, after seven and a half years away from boxing, Bowe returned with a second-round knockout over Marcus Rhode. In a second comeback fight, in April 2005, an overweight Bowe narrowly defeated journeyman Billy Zumbrun by ten round split decision.

Bowe declared bankruptcy in 2005. 
On December 13, 2008, with the help of new manager Bob Bain, Bowe, 41, returned to the ring for the first time in over three and a half years on the undercard of the Wladimir Klitschko versus Hasim Rahman world heavyweight title bout in Mannheim, Germany and won an eight-round unanimous decision over Gene Pukall.

===Legacy and reputation===

Riddick Bowe&#x27;s boxing record stands at 43 wins and 1 loss, with 33 knockouts. In the autobiography of veteran former referee Mills Lane, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, who had officiated at some of Bowe&#x27;s fights, he professed that Bowe could have been one of boxing&#x27;s greatest boxers but foolishly squandered the opportunity through immaturity and lack of discipline.

BoxRec ranks Bowe as the 28th greatest fighter among boxers that had their last professional boxing match at heavyweight. Noted for his in-fighting skills, jab and combination punching, Bowe&#x27;s first fight with Evander Holyfield is considered one of the greatest world heavyweight title fights of all time. Following this victory, he met Nelson Mandela during a visit to South Africa. Bowe&#x27;s trainer at the time, Eddie Futch, lamented that upon his return, Bowe failed to ever achieve the same physical condition for his subsequent fights.

In 2017, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine ranked Bowe as the 19th best heavyweight of all time in a poll of a panel of 30 trainers, matchmakers and members of the boxing media. The consensus was that Bowe, described as both a &quot;super talent&quot; and a &quot;super waste&quot;, only had one great fight, when winning the title from Holyfield, and ultimately disappointed in squandering his obvious natural ability due to laziness.

Bowe&#x27;s reputation suffered because of the weak challengers he faced as champion (an aging Michael Dokes and also Jesse Ferguson) before losing the title to Holyfield in their rematch. He is also widely criticized for relinquishing the WBC title rather than defending it against mandatory challenger Lennox Lewis, thus fracturing the undisputed championship until Lewis unified the titles in 1999.

Bowe is the first boxer in any division to hold all four major versions of the world championship (WBA, WBC, IBF, and WBO) during his career, an accomplishment emulated in the heavyweight division only by Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk.

Bowe&#x27;s sole loss, to Evander Holyfield in 1993, was avenged in 1995, meaning that he finished their trilogy 2-1 ahead. With the exception of a 1994 no-contest with Buster Mathis Jr., Bowe defeated every opponent he faced as a professional.

Alongside Gene Tunney, Rocky Marciano, Sultan Ibragimov and Nikolai Valuev, Bowe is one of five former heavyweight champions to have never suffered a stoppage defeat during his career.

==Professional kickboxing career==
In March 2013, Bowe announced his Muay Thai debut, having trained under Kru Airr Phanthip and Kru Chan in Las Vegas. He faced Levgen Golovin for the WPMF Super Heavyweight World Title in Pattaya, Thailand. On June 14, 2013, Bowe was knocked down five times from kicks to his leg. The championship match was called to a stop halfway through the second round.

==Life outside of boxing==
===Joining the Marine Corps===
After the Golota fights, Bowe retired from boxing and decided to join the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He said he made the decision both to make his mother proud and to rededicate himself to training, with the intention of returning to boxing shortly after.

Bowe arrived at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island on February 10, 1997. On his first day of recruit training, Bowe discussed leaving the Corps with Marine commanders, and quit after three days of heavy physical training with his platoon in Parris Island, South Carolina, on February 21, 1997.

===Humanitarian Activities===
Shortly after winning his first title against Evander Holyfield, Bowe saw a news story on television that revealed a million dollars worth of medicines donated to the Somali refugees and orphans were not able to be transported to the war-torn region due to a lack of funds to pay for the charter aircraft needed. Bowe immediately had his representatives contact AmeriCares, the NGO leading the effort, and pledged the 100,000 dollars needed to fund the trip - on the condition he could go to the country with the goods, and make sure they got to their intended recipients. While in Somalia, he visited U.S. Marines and an orphanage on the Kenyan border. He was accompanied by several members of his management team, including manager Rock Newman and Head of International Sales Alexis Denny (CEO of an independent media distributor).

Bowe also took action when he heard news of other tragedies. In 1995, when Alexis Denny was in Indonesia on other business, she read Asian news coverage of Rodolfo Yap, a young man in the Philippines who was electrocuted while positioning his antenna so his family could watch a Riddick Bowe fight. She relayed this news to Bowe, and explained to the media at the time &#x27;The heavyweight champion was very moved by the story and having lost a brother and a sister earlier in life, decided to make a financial contribution to the family of Mr. Yap.&quot;
Bowe authorized her to fly to the Philippines and try to locate the man&#x27;s family, make a contribution to their expenses, and also provide funds to support the Philippine boxing Team training for the Olympics (in the name of the deceased).

===Prison===
Bowe was convicted of the February 1998 kidnapping of his estranged wife Judy, and their five children. Thinking it would reconcile his marriage, Bowe went to his wife&#x27;s Cornelius, North Carolina, home and threatened her with a knife, handcuffs, duct tape, and pepper spray. He forced her and their children into a vehicle and set out for his Fort Washington, Maryland, home. During the kidnapping, Bowe stabbed his wife in the chest. Police captured Bowe in South Hill, Virginia, freeing his family. Bowe agreed to a plea bargain of guilty to &quot;interstate domestic violence&quot;, and was sentenced to 18 to 24 months in prison. Despite the agreed sentence, on February 29, 2000, the judge sentenced Bowe to only 30 days, due to a claim of brain damage by Bowe&#x27;s defense. This sentence, counter to the plea agreement, was later overturned. Bowe served 17 months in Federal prison. On February 8, 2001, Bowe was arrested in Long Island after a domestic dispute with his new wife. Bowe allegedly dragged his wife and left her with cuts on her knees and elbows.

===Attempted professional wrestling debut===
In 2013, Riddick Bowe announced his intentions to start training to be a professional wrestler. He was to make his debut for the UK-based Preston City Wrestling organization on March 1, 2014. On December 14, 2013, Preston City Wrestling announced on their Facebook Page that Bowe would no longer be appearing due to a disagreement with Bowe&#x27;s new agent.

==In popular culture==
In 1993, a video game entitled &quot;Riddick Bowe Boxing&quot; was released for various platforms. Also that year, Bowe appeared in an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, entitled &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, as a bully named &quot;Bo&quot;.

In 1997, Bowe appeared in the music video “Mo Money Mo Problems” by The Notorious B.I.G.

<text>William Wyon (Birmingham 1795 – 29 October 1851), was official chief engraver at the Royal Mint from 1828 until his death.

==Biography==

Wyon was born in Birmingham and, in 1809, was apprenticed to his father, Peter Wyon who was an engraver and die sinker. In 1816, he went to London. He studied the works of John Flaxman, attended the schools of the Royal Academy, and gained a gold medal from the Society of Arts for a copy of the head of Ceres, and a second for an original group. In 1816 he was appointed assistant engraver to the mint, and in 1828 chief engraver. In 1831 he was elected associate and in 1838 full member of the Royal Academy. He died in Brighton, United Kingdom. Wyon is buried under a simple rectangular York stone slab at West Norwood Cemetery. He was the father of engraver Leonard Charles Wyon.

==Designs==
Under the influence of Flaxman, a master of relief sculpture, Wyon was a highly visible proponent of the Neoclassicist vogue.

In 1834 he modelled the head of Princess Victoria, who was 15 years of age at the time. This work was subsequently used for the City Medal struck in 1837 to celebrate Victoria&#x27;s first visit to the City of London after her accession to the throne and another medal also issued in 1837 commemorating her visit to the Guildhall.

The name of William Wyon is well known among coin and medal collectors because of his prodigious output and artistic skill. He designed the second and third effigies of George IV, the effigy of William IV in 1830, working from the bust by Sir Francis Chantrey, and &quot;The Young Head&quot;, which graced Victoria&#x27;s coinage from 1838 to 1860 on the pennies and the rest of the coinage until 1887. He also designed the Naval General Service Medal, of which 20,933 were issued. Notable among his medallic work are the obverse designs for the prize, juror and other medals for The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in 1851, the year of his death in Birmingham.

Wyon&#x27;s City Medal was the model for the head on the line-engraved postage stamps of 1840–79, beginning with the Penny Black, the world&#x27;s first adhesive postage stamp, the embossed stamps of 1847–54 and the postal stationery 1841–1901. The primary die used for the embossed issue was engraved by Wyon; the 1s and 10d stamps have the initials &quot;ww&quot; along with the die number at the base of the neck. His design also influenced the surface-printed stamps first printed in 1855.

<text>Messrs. Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co was a printer of books, bank notes and postage stamps, most notable for printing the Penny Black, the world&#x27;s first adhesive postage stamps, in 1840.

== Origins ==
Jacob Perkins invented and sold &quot;soft steel&quot; plates for engraving that were hardened after being engraved. The plates were between one and three inches thick, and some weighed fifty pounds. He produced some currency in the US, and with engraver Gideon Fairman produced the first books to be engraved on steel in the USA. Several eight-page books &quot;Perkins and Fairman&#x27;s Running Hand&quot;. They produced currency for Massachusetts, and had won the contract for the new USA National Bank&#x27;s currency. They were from Boston, Massachusetts.

Jacob Perkins was enticed to come to England by Charles Heath, because of all the world&#x27;s currency, Perkins&#x27; notes were considered the best. He arrived with Gideon Fairman and Asa Spencer and set up shop as &quot;Perkins and Fairman&quot; in London, and worked exclusively for several months on the attempt to win the Bank of England project. After a few months, Perkins was indebted to the Heaths for a small sum. Perkins and Fairman added Charles Heath as a partner, and moved their shop to 69 Fleet Street. Charles Heath at times owned half the company.

Jacob Perkins, Gideon Fairman, George Heath (financial contribution only), and Charles Heath formed &quot;Perkins, Fairman, and Heath&quot;. They produced some books, stamps, one-pound notes for English banks, and currency. The stamps were the first stamps in the world to have adhesive. Jacob Perkins and Charles Heath also had other successful businesses going at the same time.

Perkins and Charles Heath were not as successful with their finances. They did have good accounting of any debts to the company, and shares sold between themselves, and percentage ownership of every project.

== Brief Timeline ==
* 1808-1810 Jacob Perkins and Gideon Fairman produce the first known books in the US to use steel plates.
* ~1816 Jacob Perkins has &quot;soft steel&quot; plates to engrave on, and a method to harden the plates, and a process.
* 1818 (April 15), Heath discussed the American bank notes printed by Perkins at the Society of Arts Committee on Forgery.
* Bank of England was offering a £20,000 prize for unforgeable notes.
* 1819 (May 31) Perkins sets sail for England after communicating with Charles Heath.
* 1819 (June 29) Perkins arrives in Liverpool, England.
* 1819 (July) Sir Joseph Banks met with Perkins.
* 1819 (December 20) The Heaths join Perkins and Fairman forming &quot;Perkins, Fairman and Heath&quot;.
* 1819 George Heath provides some financial backing only.
* 1820 (Feb) Bank of England chooses another solution, but other business follows, including £1 notes and stamps.
* 1820 (Feb) Perkins among other ventures, goes into the book publishing business with the Heaths and Fairman.
* 1820 (summer) &quot;Perkins Fairman and Heath&quot; move to 69 Fleet Street, London.
* 1820 (September) Perkins had sold 1,000 plates he had intended to use on the Bank of England project.
* 1822 &quot;Perkins and Heath&quot;
* 1829 &quot;Perkins and Bacon&quot;. Joshua Butters Bacon ( Perkins&#x27; son in law), buys Heaths interest.
* 1834-1852 &quot;Perkins, Bacon &amp; Petch&quot; (Henry Petch was an engraver, who was also made a partner).
* 1839 &quot;Perkins Bacon and Co&quot; are asked to make plates and dies for stamps (the Penny Black was their first stamp).

There is an overlap of &quot;Perkins, Bacon &amp; Petch&quot; and &quot;Perkins, Bacon and Co&quot;; not all business ventures included all partners and percentage ownership is detailed as changing as shares were bought and sold between partners, and money was loaned to partners from the company. Additionally, Charles Heath had many other individual business ventures, as did Perkins. Heath and Perkins had numerous talents and successes, however, they routinely had financial problems. Fortunately, the accounting was very good. Charles Heath had professional relationships with several people that spanned decades.

== History ==

England was offering a prize of £20,000 for a note which was impossible to forge. Heath contacted Perkins and convinced him to come to England and Perkins arrived in Liverpool in 1819. They produced samples to Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Commission on Forgery, and it appeared that they would win. They did not. Perkins started showing signs of financial distress and was in minor debt to the Heaths. They did manage to secure smaller contracts for smaller £1 notes, and later won more government contracts, but in the meantime they started publishing.

George Heath, Charles Heath, Jacob Perkins and Gideon Fairman had multiple partnerships and individual projects going on at the same time. George Heath was a financial backer only. Charles Heath was an engraver, a book publisher. Jacob Perkins was an inventor who made steel book plates practical (but not cheaper). Fairman had produced a book with Perkins in the USA. 
Financial difficulties of one or the other partners had at least one of them in debt to the company at any moment in time, and the accounting records from these guys are confusing, but very businesslike. Their percentage of profits of any venture changed often.

By 1822 it was known as &quot;Perkins &amp; Heath&quot;, then in 1829, after a complicated transaction in which Heath gave up his shares and Joshua Butters Bacon (Perkin&#x27;s son in law) bought in, as &quot;Perkins &amp; Bacon&quot;. Henry Petch joined in 1835, and thus the firm printing the first stamps was actually known as &quot;Perkins, Bacon &amp; Petch&quot;. The Penny Black printing plates are currently on display at the British Library. When Petch died in 1852, the firm became just &quot;Perkins, Bacon&quot;.

In 1861 they (temporarily) lost the contract to print stamps as a punishment for giving copies of new issues away to friends of the management without permission from the governments involved. Although Heath had won another court battle which gave engravers the right to retain 8 impressions of any engraving, this right did not extend to currency or stamps.
They completed their printing contract for the line-engraved stamps on 31 December 1879, losing subsequent business to competitor De La Rue.

In addition to British stamps, Perkins, Bacon printed for a number of the colonies, including the first stamps of the Cape of Good Hope, which were printed in 1853.

In 1935 the firm went out of business and its records were acquired by Charles and Harry Nissen and Thomas Allen. The records were subsequently acquired by the Royal Philatelic Society London where Percy de Worms organised them for publication and display.

<text>The Uniform Penny Post was a component of the comprehensive reform of the Royal Mail, the UK&#x27;s official postal service, that took place in the 19th century. The reforms were a government initiative to eradicate the abuse and corruption of the existing service. Under the reforms, the postal service became a government monopoly, but it also became more accessible to the British population at large through setting a charge of one penny for carriage and delivery between any two places in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland irrespective of distance.

==Campaign for reform==
Richard Cobden and John Ramsey McCulloch, both advocates of free trade, attacked the Conservative government&#x27;s policies of privilege and protection, including their archaic postal system. McCulloch, in 1833, advanced the view that &quot;nothing contributes more to facilitate commerce than the safe, speedy and cheap conveyance of letters.&quot; The campaign for cheap postage was actually initiated by Robert Wallace, who in 1835 argued, before a governmental commission set up to investigate the problems, that greater use of the mailing system would lead to increased revenue for the government.

==Rowland Hill&#x27;s reforms==
Rowland Hill expounded his concept for the reformed service at a meeting of the commission on February 13, 1837, and published a famous pamphlet &quot;Post Office Reform: its Importance and Practicability&quot; late that year. In 1838 Hill made a proposal to parliament in which he suggested that &quot;the postage on all letters received in a post-town, and delivered in the same, or any other post-town in the British Isles, shall be at the uniform rate of one penny per half ounce&quot;. However, Hill did not include a specific timetable for the introduction of a &quot;penny post&quot; in his proposal, nor did he suggest a plan for its implementation. Nonetheless, Hill&#x27;s 1838 proposal paved the way for the Post Office (Duties) Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 96) which introduced the Uniform Penny Post.

In his proposal, Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for postage, at a time when prepayment was optional. Previously, postage had depended on distance and the number of sheets of paper; now, one penny would assure delivery of an envelope and the letter it enclosed anywhere in the country provided together they satisfied the weight condition. This was a lower rate than before, when the cost of postage was usually more than 4d (four pence). The reform did not settle the issue of who paid for the postage, as it still remained optional for a number of years in spite of Hill&#x27;s efforts as Secretary to the Post Office to alter the situation.

 the value of one penny in 1840 ranges from 32p to £4.89; the latter based on mean income. It would appear that the cost to an established semi-skilled man of sending a letter in 1840 can be represented by approximately £1 in 2013 values.

This however was a lower cost than previously and made postal communication more affordable to the increasing numbers of people capable of reading and writing as a consequence of public education. Financially, the penny post scheme initially was a disaster. However, Hill made the case that if letters were cheaper to send, people, including the poorer classes, would send more of them, thus eventually profits would go up. In 1840, the first year of Penny Post, the number of letters sent in the UK more than doubled. Within 10 years, it had doubled again. The BBC states, “Hill had shown that the fortune at the bottom of the pyramid was there to be mined.” The other benefits were the encouragement and support that the availability of cheap letterpost communication gave to the development of transport links, education, commerce and social cohesion.

<doc id="240749" wikidata="Q1540899" url="?curid=240749" title="MEDLINE">
<text>MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or MEDLARS Online) is a bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information. It includes bibliographic information for articles from academic journals covering medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and health care. MEDLINE also covers much of the literature in biology and biochemistry, as well as fields such as molecular evolution.

Compiled by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), MEDLINE is freely available on the Internet and searchable via PubMed and NLM&#x27;s National Center for Biotechnology Information&#x27;s Entrez system.

== History ==
MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) was a computerised biomedical bibliographic retrieval system. It was launched by the National Library of Medicine in 1964 and was the first large-scale, computer-based, retrospective search service available to the general public.

=== Initial development of MEDLARS ===

Since 1879, the National Library of Medicine has published &quot;Index Medicus&quot;, a monthly guide to medical articles in thousands of journals. The huge volume of bibliographic citations was manually compiled. In 1957 the staff of the NLM started to plan the mechanization of the &quot;Index Medicus&quot;, prompted by a desire for a better way to manipulate all this information, not only for &quot;Index Medicus&quot; but also to produce subsidiary products. By 1960 a detailed specification was prepared, and by the spring of 1961, request for proposals were sent out to 72 companies to develop the system. As a result, a contract was awarded to the General Electric Company. A Minneapolis-Honeywell 800 computer, which was to run MEDLARS, was delivered to the NLM in March 1963, and Frank Bradway Rogers (Director of the NLM 1949 to 1963) said at the time, &quot;..If all goes well, the January 1964 issue of &quot;Index Medicus&quot; will be ready to emerge from the system at the end of this year. It may be that this will mark the beginning of a new era in medical bibliography.&quot;

MEDLARS cost $3 million to develop, and at the time of its completion in 1964, no other publicly available, fully operational electronic storage and retrieval system of its magnitude existed. The original computer configuration operated from 1964 until its replacement by MEDLARS II in January 1975.

=== MEDLARS Online ===
In late 1971, an online version called MEDLINE (&quot;MEDLARS Online&quot;) became available as a way to do online searching of MEDLARS from remote medical libraries. This early system covered 239 journals and boasted that it could support as many as 25 simultaneous online users (remotely logged in from distant medical libraries) at one time. However, this system remained primarily in the hands of libraries, with researchers able to submit pre-programmed search tasks to librarians and obtain results on printouts, but rarely able to interact with the NLM computer output in real-time. This situation continued through the beginning of the 1990s and the rise of the World Wide Web.

In 1996, soon after most home computers began automatically bundling efficient web browsers, a free public version of MEDLINE was deployed. This system, called PubMed, was offered to the general online user in June 1997, when MEDLINE searches via the Web were demonstrated.

== Database ==
In December 2024, the database contained more than 38 million records from over 5,200 selected publications covering biomedicine and health from 1781 to the present. Originally, the database covered articles starting from 1965, but this has been enhanced, and records as far back as 1781 are now available within the main index. The database is freely accessible on the Internet via the PubMed interface, and new citations are added Tuesday through Saturday. For citations added during 1995-2003, about 48% are for cited articles published in the U.S., about 88% are published in English (overall about 84%), and about 76% have English abstracts written by authors of the articles.

=== Data quality ===
Being an aggregated source, the PubMed database suffers from multi-source problems such as inconsistent representations from the upstream data providers.

== Retrieval ==
MEDLINE uses Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for information retrieval. Engines designed to search MEDLINE (such as Entrez and PubMed) generally use a Boolean expression combining MeSH terms, words in the abstract and title of the article, author names, date of publication, etc. Entrez and PubMed can also find articles similar to a given one based on a mathematical scoring system that takes into account the similarity of word content of the abstracts and titles of two articles.

MEDLINE added a &quot;publication type&quot; term for &quot;randomized controlled trial&quot; in 1991 and a MESH subset &quot;systematic review&quot; in 2001.

== Importance ==
MEDLINE functions as an important resource for biomedical researchers and journal clubs from all over the world. Along with the Cochrane Library and a number of other databases, MEDLINE facilitates evidence-based medicine. Most systematic review articles published presently build on extensive searches of MEDLINE to identify articles that might be useful in the review. MEDLINE influences researchers in their choice of journals in which to publish.

== Inclusion of journals ==
More than 5,200 biomedical journals are indexed in MEDLINE. New journals are not included automatically or immediately. Several criteria for selection are applied. Selection is based on the recommendations of a panel, the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee, based on the scientific scope and quality of a journal. The Journals Database (one of the Entrez databases) contains information, such as its name abbreviation and publisher, about all journals included in Entrez, including PubMed. Journals that no longer meet the criteria are removed. Being indexed in MEDLINE gives a non-predatory identity to a journal.

== Usage ==
PubMed usage has been on the rise since 2008. In 2011, PubMed/MEDLINE was searched 1.8 billion times, up from 1.6 billion searches in the previous year. In 2023, the database was searched 3.66 billion times.

A service such as MEDLINE strives to balance usability with power and comprehensiveness. In keeping with the fact that MEDLINE&#x27;s primary user community is professionals (medical scientists, health care providers), searching MEDLINE effectively is a learned skill; untrained users are sometimes frustrated with the large numbers of articles returned by simple searches. Counterintuitively, a search that returns thousands of articles is not guaranteed to be comprehensive. Unlike using a typical Internet search engine, PubMed searching MEDLINE requires a little investment of time. Using the MeSH database to define the subject of interest is one of the most useful ways to improve the quality of a search. Using MeSH terms in conjunction with limits (such as publication date or publication type), qualifiers (such as adverse effects or prevention and control), and text-word searching is another. Finding one article on the subject and clicking on the &quot;Related Articles&quot; link to get a collection of similarly classified articles can expand a search that otherwise yields few results.

For who are trying to learn about health and medicine topics, the NIH offers MedlinePlus; thus, although such users are still free to search and read the medical literature themselves (via PubMed), they also have some help with curating it into something comprehensible and practically applicable for patients and family members.

<doc id="240755" wikidata="Q865902" url="?curid=240755" title="Aesop's Fables">
<text>Aesop&#x27;s Fables, or the Aesopica, is a collection of fables credited to Aesop, a slave and storyteller who lived in ancient Greece between 620 and 564 BCE. Of varied and unclear origins, the stories associated with his name have descended to modern times through a number of sources and continue to be reinterpreted in different verbal registers and in popular as well as artistic media.

The fables were part of oral tradition and were not collected until about three centuries after Aesop&#x27;s death. By that time, a variety of other stories, jokes and proverbs were being ascribed to him, although some of that material was from sources earlier than him or came from beyond the Greek cultural sphere. The process of inclusion has continued until the present, with some of the fables unrecorded before the Late Middle Ages and others arriving from outside Europe. The process is continuous and new stories are still being added to the Aesop corpus, even when they are demonstrably more recent work and sometimes from known authors.

Manuscripts in Latin and Greek were important avenues of transmissions, although poetical treatments in European vernaculars eventually formed another. On the arrival of printing, collections of Aesop&#x27;s fables were among the earliest books in a variety of languages. Through the means of later collections, and translations or adaptations of them, Aesop&#x27;s reputation as a was transmitted throughout the world.

Initially the fables were addressed to adults and covered religious, social and political themes. They were also put to use as ethical guides and from the Renaissance onwards were particularly used for the education of children. Their ethical dimension was reinforced in the adult world through depiction in sculpture, painting and other illustrative means, as well as adaptation to drama and song. In addition, there have been reinterpretations of the meaning of fables and changes in emphasis over time.

==Fictions that point to the truth==
===Fable as a genre===
Apollonius of Tyana, a 1st-century CE philosopher, is recorded as having said about Aesop:

Earlier still, the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned in passing that &quot;Aesop the fable writer&quot; (; ) was a slave who lived in Ancient Greece during the 5th century BCE. Among references in other writers, Aristophanes, in his comedy &quot;The Wasps&quot;, represented the protagonist Philocleon as having learnt the &quot;absurdities&quot; of Aesop from conversation at banquets; Plato wrote in &quot;Phaedo &quot;that Socrates whiled away his time in prison turning some of Aesop&#x27;s fables &quot;which he knew&quot; into verses. Nonetheless, for two main reasons – because numerous morals within Aesop&#x27;s attributed fables contradict each other, and because ancient accounts of Aesop&#x27;s life contradict each other – the modern view is that Aesop was not the originator of all those fables attributed to him. Instead, any fable tended to be ascribed to the name of Aesop if there was no known alternative literary source.

In Classical times there were various theorists who tried to differentiate these fables from other kinds of narration. They had to be short and unaffected; in addition, they are fictitious, useful to life and true to nature. In them could be found talking animals and plants, although humans interacting only with humans figure in a few. Typically they might begin with a contextual introduction, followed by the story, often with the moral underlined at the end. Setting the context was often necessary as a guide to the story&#x27;s interpretation, as in the case of the political meaning of The Frogs Who Desired a King and The Frogs and the Sun.

Sometimes the titles given later to the fables have become proverbial, as in the case of killing the Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs or the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse. In fact some fables, such as The Young Man and the Swallow, appear to have been invented as illustrations of already existing proverbs. One theorist, indeed, went so far as to define fables as extended proverbs. In this they have an aetiological function, the explaining of origins such as, in another context, why the ant is a mean, thieving creature or how the tortoise got its shell. Other fables, also verging on this function, are outright jokes, as in the case of The Old Woman and the Doctor, aimed at greedy practitioners of medicine.

===Origins===
The contradictions between fables already mentioned and alternative versions of much the same fable, as in the case of The Woodcutter and the Trees, are best explained by the ascription to Aesop of all examples of the genre. Some are demonstrably of West Asian origin, others have analogues further to the East. Modern scholarship reveals fables and proverbs of Aesopic form existing in both ancient Sumer and Akkad, as early as the third millennium BCE. Aesop&#x27;s fables and the Indian tradition, as represented by the Buddhist &quot;Jataka tales&quot; and the Hindu &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, share about a dozen tales in common, although often widely differing in detail. There is some debate over whether the Greeks learned these fables from Indian storytellers or the other way, or if the influences were mutual.

Loeb editor Ben E. Perry took the extreme position in his book &quot;Babrius and Phaedrus&quot; (1965) that:

Although Aesop and the Buddha were near contemporaries, the stories of neither were recorded in writing until some centuries after their death. Few disinterested scholars would now be prepared to make so absolute a stand as Perry about their origin in view of the conflicting and still emerging evidence.

==Translation and transmission==
===Greek versions===
When and how the fables arrived in and travelled from ancient Greece remains uncertain. Some cannot be dated any earlier than Babrius and Phaedrus, several centuries after Aesop, and yet others even later. The earliest mentioned collection was by Demetrius of Phalerum, an Athenian orator and statesman of the 4th century BCE, who compiled the fables into a set of ten books for the use of orators. A follower of Aristotle, he simply catalogued all the fables that earlier Greek writers had used in isolation as exempla, putting them into prose. At least it was evidence of what was attributed to Aesop by others; but this may have included any ascription to him from the oral tradition in the way of animal fables, fictitious anecdotes, etiological or satirical myths, possibly even any proverb or joke, that these writers transmitted. It is more a proof of the power of Aesop&#x27;s name to attract such stories to it than evidence of his actual authorship. In any case, although the work of Demetrius was mentioned frequently for the next twelve centuries, and was considered the official Aesop, no copy now survives. Present-day collections evolved from the later Greek version of Babrius, of which there now exists an incomplete manuscript of some 160 fables in choliambic verse. Current opinion is that he lived in the 1st century CE. The version of 55 fables in choliambic tetrameters by the 9th-century Ignatius the Deacon is also worth mentioning for its early attribution of tales from Oriental sources to Aesop.

Further light is thrown on the entry of Oriental stories into the Aesopic canon by their appearance in Jewish sources such as the Talmud and in Midrashic literature. There is a comparative list of these on the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; website of which twelve resemble those that are common to both Greek and Indian sources, six are parallel to those only in Indian sources, and six others in Greek only. Where similar fables exist in Greece, India, and in the Talmud, the Talmudic form approaches more nearly the Indian. Thus, the fable &quot;The Wolf and the Crane&quot; is told in India of a lion and another bird. When Joshua ben Hananiah told that fable to the Jews, to prevent their rebelling against Rome and once more putting their heads into the lion&#x27;s jaws (Gen. R. lxiv.), he shows familiarity with some form derived from India.

===Latin versions===
The first extensive translation of Aesop into Latin iambic trimeters was performed by Phaedrus, a freedman of Augustus in the 1st century CE, although at least one fable had already been translated by the poet Ennius two centuries before, and others are referred to in the work of Horace. The rhetorician Aphthonius of Antioch wrote a technical treatise on, and converted into Latin prose, some forty of these fables in 315. It is notable as illustrating contemporary and later usage of fables in rhetorical practice. Teachers of philosophy and rhetoric often set the fables of Aesop as an exercise for their scholars, inviting them not only to discuss the moral of the tale, but also to practise style and the rules of grammar by making new versions of their own. A little later the poet Ausonius handed down some of these fables in verse, which the writer Julianus Titianus translated into prose, and in the early 5th century Avianus put 42 of these fables into Latin elegiacs.

The largest, oldest known and most influential of the prose versions of Phaedrus bears the name of an otherwise unknown fabulist named Romulus. It contains 83 fables, dates from the 10th century and seems to have been based on an earlier prose version which, under the name of &quot;Aesop&quot; and addressed to one Rufus, may have been written in the Carolingian period or even earlier. The collection became the source from which, during the second half of the Middle Ages, almost all the collections of Latin fables in prose and verse were wholly or partially drawn. A version of the first three books of Romulus in elegiac verse, possibly made around the 12th century, was one of the most highly influential texts in medieval Europe. Referred to variously (among other titles) as the verse Romulus or elegiac Romulus, and ascribed to Gualterus Anglicus, it was a common Latin teaching text and was popular well into the Renaissance. Another version of Romulus in Latin elegiacs was made by Alexander Neckam, born at St Albans in 1157.

Interpretive &quot;translations&quot; of the elegiac Romulus were very common in Europe in the Middle Ages. Among the earliest was one in the 11th century by Ademar of Chabannes, which includes some new material. This was followed by a prose collection of parables by the Cistercian preacher Odo of Cheriton around 1200 where the fables (many of which are not Aesopic) are given a strong medieval and clerical tinge. This interpretive tendency, and the inclusion of yet more non-Aesopic material, was to grow as versions in the various European vernaculars began to appear in the following centuries.

With the revival of literary Latin during the Renaissance, authors began compiling collections of fables in which those traditionally by Aesop and those from other sources appeared side by side. One of the earliest was by Lorenzo Bevilaqua, also known as Laurentius Abstemius, who wrote 197 fables, the first hundred of which were published as &quot;Hecatomythium&quot; in 1495. Little by Aesop was included. At the most, some traditional fables are adapted and reinterpreted: The Lion and the Mouse is continued and given a new ending (fable 52); The Oak and the Reed becomes &quot;The Elm and the Willow&quot; (53); The Ant and the Grasshopper is adapted as &quot;The Gnat and the Bee&quot; (94) with the difference that the gnat offers to teach music to the bee&#x27;s children. There are also Mediaeval tales such as The Mice in Council (195) and stories created to support popular proverbs such as &#x27;Still Waters Run Deep&#x27; (5) and &#x27;A woman, an ass and a walnut tree&#x27; (65), where the latter refers back to Aesop&#x27;s fable of The Walnut Tree. Most of the fables in &quot;Hecatomythium&quot; were later translated in the second half of Roger L&#x27;Estrange&#x27;s &quot;Fables of Aesop and other eminent mythologists&quot; (1692); some also appeared among the 102 in H. Clarke&#x27;s Latin reader, &quot;Select fables of Aesop: with an English translation&quot; (1787), of which there were both English and American editions.

There were later three notable collections of fables in verse, among which the most influential was Gabriele Faerno&#x27;s &quot;Centum Fabulae&quot; (1564). The majority of the hundred fables there are Aesop&#x27;s but there are also humorous tales such as The drowned woman and her husband (41) and The miller, his son and the donkey (100). In the same year that Faerno was published in Italy, Hieronymus Osius brought out a collection of 294 fables titled &quot;Fabulae Aesopi carmine elegiaco redditae&quot; in Germany. This too contained some from elsewhere, such as The Dog in the Manger (67). Then in 1604 the Austrian Pantaleon Weiss, known as Pantaleon Candidus, published &quot;Centum et Quinquaginta Fabulae&quot;. The 152 poems there were grouped by subject, with sometimes more than one devoted to the same fable, although presenting alternative versions of it, as in the case of The Hawk and the Nightingale (133–5). It also includes the earliest instance of The Lion, the Bear and the Fox (60) in a language other than Greek.

Another voluminous collection of fables in Latin verse was Anthony Alsop&#x27;s &quot;Fabularum Aesopicarum Delectus&quot; (Oxford 1698). The bulk of the 237 fables there are prefaced by the text in Greek, while there are also a handful in Hebrew and in Arabic; the final fables, only attested from Latin sources, are without other versions. For the most part the poems are confined to a lean telling of the fable without drawing a moral.

==Aesop in other languages==
===Europe===
For many centuries the main transmission of Aesop&#x27;s fables across Europe remained in Latin or else orally in various vernaculars, where they mixed with folk tales derived from other sources. This mixing is often apparent in early vernacular collections of fables in mediaeval times.
* &quot;Ysopet&quot;, an adaptation of some of the fables into Old French octosyllabic couplets, was written by Marie de France in the 12th century. The morals with which she closes each fable reflect the feudal situation of her time.
* In the 13th century the Jewish author Berechiah ha-Nakdan wrote &quot;Mishlei Shualim&quot;, a collection of 103 &#x27;Fox Fables&#x27; in Hebrew rhymed prose. This included many animal tales passing under the name of Aesop, as well as several more derived from Marie de France and others. Berechiah&#x27;s work adds a layer of Biblical quotations and allusions to the tales, adapting them as a way to teach Jewish ethics. The first printed edition appeared in Mantua in 1557.
* &quot;Äsop&quot;, an adaptation into Middle Low German verse of 125 Romulus fables, was written by Gerhard von Minden around 1370.
* &quot;Chwedlau Odo&quot; (&quot;Odo&#x27;s Tales&quot;) is a 14th-century Welsh version of the animal fables in Odo of Cheriton&#x27;s &quot;Parabolae&quot;, not all of which are of Aesopic origin. Many show sympathy for the poor and oppressed, with often sharp criticisms of high-ranking church officials.
* Eustache Deschamps included several of Aesop&#x27;s fables among his moral ballades, written in Mediaeval French towards the end of the 14th century, in one of which there is mention of what &#x27;Aesop tells in his book&#x27; (&quot;Ysoppe dit en son livre et raconte&quot;). In most, the telling of the fable precedes the drawing of a moral in terms of contemporary behaviour, but two comment on this with only contextual reference to fables not recounted in the text.
* &quot;Isopes Fabules&quot; was written in Middle English rhyme royal stanzas by the monk John Lydgate towards the start of the 15th century. Seven tales are included and heavy emphasis is laid on the moral lessons to be learned from them.
* &quot;The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian&quot; was written in Middle Scots iambic pentameters by Robert Henryson about 1480. In the accepted text it consists of thirteen versions of fables, seven modelled on stories from &quot;Aesop&quot; expanded from the Latin Romulus manuscripts.

The main impetus behind the translation of large collections of fables attributed to Aesop and translated into European languages came from an early printed publication in Germany. There had been many small selections in various languages during the Middle Ages but the first attempt at an exhaustive edition was made by Heinrich Steinhőwel in his &quot;Esopus&quot;, published . This contained both Latin versions and German translations and also included a translation of Rinuccio da Castiglione (or d&#x27;Arezzo)&#x27;s version from the Greek of a life of Aesop (1448). Some 156 fables appear, collected from Romulus, Avianus and other sources, accompanied by a commentarial preface and moralising conclusion, and 205 woodcuts. Translations or versions based on Steinhöwel&#x27;s book followed shortly in Italian (1479), French (1480), English (the Caxton edition of 1484) and Czech in about 1488. These were many times reprinted before the start of the 16th century. The Spanish version of 1489, &quot;La vida del Ysopet con sus fabulas hystoriadas&quot; was equally successful and often reprinted in both the Old and New World through three centuries.

Some fables were later treated creatively in collections of their own by authors in such a way that they became associated with their names rather than Aesop&#x27;s. The most celebrated were La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables, published in French during the later 17th century. Inspired by the brevity and simplicity of Aesop&#x27;s, those in the first six books were heavily dependent on traditional Aesopic material; fables in the next six were more diffuse and diverse in origin.
At the start of the 19th century, some of the fables were adapted into Russian, and often reinterpreted, by the fabulist Ivan Krylov. In most cases, but not all, these were dependent on La Fontaine&#x27;s versions.

===Asia and America===
Translations into Asian languages at a very early date derive originally from Greek sources. These include the so-called &quot;Fables of Syntipas&quot;, a compilation of Aesopic fables in Syriac, dating from the 9/11th centuries. Included there were several other tales of possibly West Asian origin. In Central Asia there was a 10th-century collection of the fables in Uighur.

After the Middle Ages, fables largely deriving from Latin sources were passed on by Europeans as part of their colonial or missionary enterprises. 47 fables were translated into the Nahuatl language in the late 16th century under the title &quot;In zazanilli in Esopo&quot;. The work of a native translator, it adapted the stories to fit the Mexican environment, incorporating Aztec concepts and rituals and making them rhetorically more subtle than their Latin source.

Portuguese missionaries arriving in Japan at the end of the 16th century introduced Japan to the fables when a Latin edition was translated into romanized Japanese. The title was &quot;Esopo no Fabulas&quot; and dates to 1593. It was soon followed by a fuller translation into a three-volume kanazōshi entitled . This was the sole Western work to survive in later publication after the expulsion of Westerners from Japan, since by that time the figure of Aesop had been acculturated and presented as if he were Japanese. Coloured woodblock editions of individual fables were made by Kawanabe Kyosai in the 19th century.

The first translations of Aesop&#x27;s Fables into the Chinese languages were made at the start of the 17th century, the first substantial collection being of 38 conveyed orally by a Jesuit missionary named Nicolas Trigault and written down by a Chinese academic named Zhang Geng (Chinese: 張賡; pinyin: &quot;Zhāng Gēng&quot;) in 1625. This was followed two centuries later by &quot;Yishi Yuyan&quot; 《意拾喻言》 (&quot;Esop&#x27;s Fables: written in Chinese by the Learned Mun Mooy Seen-Shang, and compiled in their present form with a free and a literal translation&quot;) in 1840 by Robert Thom and apparently based on the version by Roger L&#x27;Estrange. This work was initially very popular until someone realised the fables were anti-authoritarian and the book was banned for a while. A little later, however, in the foreign concession in Shanghai, A. B. Cabaniss brought out a transliterated translation in Shanghai dialect, &quot;Yisuopu yu yan&quot; (伊娑菩喻言, 1856). There have also been 20th century translations by Zhou Zuoren and others.

Translations into the languages of South Asia began at the very start of the 19th century. &quot;The Oriental Fabulist&quot; (1803) contained roman script versions in Bengali, Hindi and Urdu. Adaptations followed in Marathi (1806) and Bengali (1816), and then complete collections in Hindi (1837), Kannada (1840), Urdu (1850), Tamil (1853) and Sindhi (1854).

In Burma, which had its own ethical folk tradition based on the Buddhist Jataka Tales, the joint Pali and Burmese language translation of Aesop&#x27;s fables was published in 1880 from Rangoon by the American Missionary Press. Outside the British Raj, Jagat Sundar Malla&#x27;s translation into the Newar language of Nepal was published in 1915. Further to the west, the Afghani academic Hafiz Sahar&#x27;s translation of some 250 of Aesop&#x27;s Fables into Persian was first published in 1972 under the name &quot;Luqman Hakim&quot;.

===Africa===
The South African writer Sibusiso Nyembezi translated some of Aesop&#x27;s fables into Zulu in a series of books he prepared for school students in the 1960s. However, with the aim of preserving Zulu cultural heritage, he substituted animals better known in their areas in some of these fables.

==Versions in regional languages==
===Minority expression===
The 18th to 19th centuries saw a vast quantity of fables in verse being written in all European languages. Regional languages and dialects in the Romance area made use of versions adapted particularly from La Fontaine&#x27;s recreations of ancient material. One of the earliest publications in France was the anonymous &quot;Fables Causides en Bers Gascouns&quot; (Selected fables in Gascon verse, Bayonne, 1776), which contained 106. Also in the vanguard was &#x27;s &quot;Quelques fables choisies de La Fontaine en patois limousin&quot; (109) in the Occitan Limousin dialect, originally with 39 fables, and &quot;Fables et contes en vers patois&quot; by , also published in the first decade of the 19th century in the neighbouring dialect of Montpellier. The last of these were very free recreations, with the occasional appeal directly to the original &quot;Maistre Ézôpa&quot;. A later commentator noted that while the author could sometimes embroider his theme, at others he concentrated the sense to an Aesopean brevity.

Many translations were made into languages contiguous to or within the French borders. &quot;Ipui onak&quot; (1805) was the first translation of 50 fables of Aesop by the writer Bizenta Mogel Elgezabal into the Basque language spoken on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees. It was followed in mid-century by two translations on the French side: 50 fables in J-B. Archu&#x27;s &quot;Choix de Fables de La Fontaine, traduites en vers basques&quot; (1848) and 150 in &quot;Fableac edo aleguiac Lafontenetaric berechiz hartuac&quot; (Bayonne, 1852) by Abbé Martin Goyhetche (1791–1859). Versions in Breton were written by Pierre Désiré de Goësbriand (1784–1853) in 1836 and Yves Louis Marie Combeau (1799–1870) between 1836 and 1838. The turn of Provençal came in 1859 with &quot;Li Boutoun de guèto, poésies patoises&quot; by Antoine Bigot (1825–1897), followed by several other collections of fables in the Nîmes dialect between 1881 and 1891. Alsatian dialect versions of La Fontaine appeared in 1879 after the region was ceded away following the Franco-Prussian War. At the end of the following century, Brother Denis-Joseph Sibler (1920–2002) published a collection of adaptations (first recorded in 1983) that has gone through several impressions since 1995. The use of Corsican came later. Natale Rochicchioli (1911–2002) was particularly well known for his very free adaptations of La Fontaine, of which he made recordings as well as publishing his &quot;Favule di Natale&quot; in the 1970s.

During the 19th century renaissance of Belgian dialect literature in Walloon, several authors adapted versions of the fables to the racy speech (and subject matter) of Liège. They included (in 1842); Joseph Lamaye (1845); and the team of and François Bailleux, who between them covered all of La Fontaine&#x27;s books I–VI, (&quot;Fåves da Lafontaine mettowes è ligeois&quot;, 1850–56). Adaptations into other regional dialects were made by Charles Letellier (Mons, 1842) and Charles Wérotte (Namur, 1844); much later, Léon Bernus published some hundred imitations of La Fontaine in the dialect of Charleroi (1872); he was followed during the 1880s by , writing in the Borinage dialect under the pen-name Bosquètia. In the 20th century there has been a selection of fifty fables in the Condroz dialect by Joseph Houziaux (1946), to mention only the most prolific in an ongoing surge of adaptation.

The motive behind the later activity across these areas was to assert regional specificity against a growing centralism and the encroachment of the language of the capital on what had until then been predominantly monoglot areas. Surveying its literary manifestations, commentators have noted that the point of departure of the individual tales is not as important as what they become in the process. Even in the hands of less skilled dialect adaptations, La Fontaine&#x27;s polished versions of the fables are returned to the folkloristic roots by which they often came to him in the first places. But many of the gifted regional authors were well aware of what they were doing in their work. In fitting the narration of the story to their local idiom, in appealing to the folk proverbs derived from such tales, and in adapting the story to local conditions and circumstances, the fables were so transposed as to go beyond bare equivalence, becoming independent works in their own right. Thus Emile Ruben claimed of the linguistic transmutations in Jean Foucaud&#x27;s collection of fables that, &quot;not content with translating, he has created a new work&quot;. In a similar way, the critic Maurice Piron described the Walloon versions of François Bailleux as &quot;masterpieces of original imitation&quot;, and this is echoed in the claim that in Natale Rocchiccioli&#x27;s free Corsican versions too there is &quot;more creation than adaptation&quot;.

In the 20th century there were also translations into regional dialects of English. These include the few examples in Addison Hibbard&#x27;s &quot;Aesop in Negro Dialect&quot; (&quot;American Speech&quot;, 1926) and the 26 in Robert Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Fables of Aesop in Scots Verse&quot; (Peterhead, Scotland, 1987), translated into the Aberdeenshire dialect. Glasgow University has also been responsible for R.W. Smith&#x27;s modernised dialect translation of Robert Henryson&#x27;s &quot;The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian&quot; (1999, see above). The University of Illinois likewise included dialect translations by Norman Shapiro in its &quot;Creole echoes: the francophone poetry of nineteenth-century Louisiana&quot; (2004, see below).

===Creole===
Such adaptations to Caribbean French-based creole languages from the middle of the 19th century onward – initially as part of the colonialist project but later as an assertion of love for and pride in the dialect. A version of La Fontaine&#x27;s fables in the dialect of Martinique was made by François-Achille Marbot (1817–1866) in &quot;Les Bambous, Fables de la Fontaine travesties en patois créole&quot; (Port Royal, 1846) which had lasting success. As well as two later editions in Martinique, there were two more published in France in 1870 and 1885 and others in the 20th century. Later dialect fables by Paul Baudot (1801–1870) from neighbouring Guadeloupe owed nothing to La Fontaine, but in 1869 some translated examples did appear in a grammar of Trinidadian French creole written by John Jacob Thomas. Then the start of the new century saw the publication of Georges Sylvain&#x27;s &quot;Cric? Crac! Fables de la Fontaine racontées par un montagnard haïtien et transcrites en vers créoles&quot; (La Fontaine&#x27;s fables told by a Haiti highlander and written in creole verse, 1901).

On the South American mainland, Alfred de Saint-Quentin published a selection of fables freely adapted from La Fontaine into Guyanese creole in 1872. This was among a collection of poems and stories (with facing translations) in a book that also included a short history of the territory and an essay on creole grammar. On the other side of the Caribbean, Jules Choppin (1830–1914) was adapting La Fontaine to the Louisiana slave creole at the end of the 19th century in versions that are still appreciated. The New Orleans author Edgar Grima (1847–1939) also adapted La Fontaine into both standard French and into dialect.

Versions in the French creole of the islands in the Indian Ocean began somewhat earlier than in the Caribbean. (1801–1856) emigrated from Brittany to Réunion in 1820. Having become a schoolmaster, he adapted some of La Fontaine&#x27;s fables into the local dialect in &quot;Fables créoles dédiées aux dames de l&#x27;île Bourbon&quot; (Creole fables for island women). This was published in 1829 and went through three editions. In addition 49 fables of La Fontaine were adapted to the Seychelles dialect around 1900 by Rodolphine Young (1860–1932) but these remained unpublished until 1983. Jean-Louis Robert&#x27;s recent translation of Babrius into Réunion creole (2007) adds a further motive for such adaptation. Fables began as an expression of the slave culture and their background is in the simplicity of agrarian life. Creole transmits this experience with greater purity than the urbane language of the slave-owner. More recently still there has been &quot;Ezop Pou Zanfan Lekol&quot; (2017), free adaptations of 125 fables into Mauritian Creole by Dev Virahsawmy, accompanied by English texts drawn from &quot;The Aesop for Children&quot; (1919).

===Slang===
Fables belong essentially to the oral tradition; they survive by being remembered and then retold in one&#x27;s own words. When they are written down, particularly in the dominant language of instruction, they lose something of their essence. A strategy for reclaiming them is therefore to exploit the gap between the written and the spoken language. One of those who did this in English was Sir Roger L&#x27;Estrange, who translated the fables into the racy urban slang of his day and further underlined their purpose by including in his collection many of the subversive Latin fables of Laurentius Abstemius. In France the fable tradition had already been renewed in the 17th century by La Fontaine&#x27;s influential reinterpretations of Aesop and others. In the centuries that followed there were further reinterpretations through the medium of regional languages, which to those at the centre were regarded as little better than slang. Eventually, however, the demotic tongue of the cities themselves began to be appreciated as a literary medium.

One of the earliest examples of these urban slang translations was the series of individual fables contained in a single folded sheet, appearing under the title of &quot;Les Fables de Gibbs&quot; in 1929. Others written during the period were eventually anthologised as &quot;Fables de La Fontaine en argot&quot; (Étoile sur Rhône, 1989). This followed the genre&#x27;s growth in popularity after World War II. Two short selections of fables by Bernard Gelval about 1945 were succeeded by two selections of 15 fables each by &#x27;Marcus&#x27; (Paris, 1947. Reprinted in 1958 and 2006), Api Condret&#x27;s &quot;Recueil des fables en argot&quot; (Paris, 1951) and Géo Sandry (1897–1975) and Jean Kolb&#x27;s &quot;Fables en argot&quot; (Paris, 1950/60). The majority of such printings were privately produced leaflets and pamphlets, often sold by entertainers at their performances, and are difficult to date. Some of these poems then entered the repertoire of noted performers such as Boby Forest and Yves Deniaud, of which recordings were made. In the south of France, Georges Goudon published numerous folded sheets of fables in the post-war period. Described as monologues, they use Lyon slang and the Mediterranean Lingua Franca known as Sabir.
Slang versions by others continue to be produced in various parts of France, both in printed and recorded form.

==Children==
The first printed version of Aesop&#x27;s Fables in English was published on 26 March 1484, by William Caxton. Many others, in prose and verse, followed over the centuries. In the 20th century Ben E. Perry edited the Aesopic fables of Babrius and Phaedrus for the Loeb Classical Library and compiled a numbered index by type in 1952. Olivia and Robert Temple&#x27;s Penguin edition is titled &quot;The Complete Fables by Aesop&quot; (1998) but in fact many from Babrius, Phaedrus and other major ancient sources have been omitted. More recently, in 2002 a translation by Laura Gibbs titled &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; was published by Oxford World&#x27;s Classics. This book includes 359 and has selections from all the major Greek and Latin sources.

Until the 18th century the fables were largely put to adult use by teachers, preachers, speech-makers and moralists. It was the philosopher John Locke who first seems to have advocated targeting children as a special audience in &quot;Some Thoughts Concerning Education&quot; (1693). Aesop&#x27;s fables in his opinion are:

That young people are a special target for the fables was not a particularly new idea and a number of ingenious schemes for catering to that audience had already been put into practice in Europe. The &quot;Centum Fabulae&quot; of Gabriele Faerno was commissioned by Pope Pius IV in the 16th century &#x27;so that children might learn, at the same time and from the same book, both moral and linguistic purity&#x27;. When King Louis XIV of France wanted to instruct his six-year-old son, he incorporated the series of hydraulic statues representing 38 chosen fables in the labyrinth of Versailles in the 1670s. In this he had been advised by Charles Perrault, who was later to translate Faerno&#x27;s widely published Latin poems into French verse and so bring them to a wider audience. Then in the 1730s appeared the eight volumes of &quot;Nouvelles Poésies Spirituelles et Morales sur les plus beaux airs&quot;, the first six of which incorporated a section of fables specifically aimed at children. In this the fables of La Fontaine were rewritten to fit popular airs of the day and arranged for simple performance. The preface to this work comments that &#x27;we consider ourselves happy if, in giving them an attraction to useful lessons which are suited to their age, we have given them an aversion to the profane songs which are often put into their mouths and which only serve to corrupt their innocence.&#x27; The work was popular and reprinted into the following century.

In Great Britain various authors began to develop this new market in the 18th century, giving a brief outline of the story and what was usually a longer commentary on its moral and practical meaning. The first of such works is Reverend Samuel Croxall&#x27;s &quot;Fables of Aesop and Others, newly done into English with an Application to each Fable&quot;. First published in 1722, with engravings for each fable by Elisha Kirkall, it was continually reprinted into the second half of the 19th century. Another popular collection was John Newbery&#x27;s &quot;Fables in Verse for the Improvement of the Young and the Old&quot;, facetiously attributed to Abraham Aesop Esquire, which was to see ten editions after its first publication in 1757. Robert Dodsley&#x27;s three-volume &quot;Select Fables of Esop and other Fabulists&quot; is distinguished for several reasons. First that it was printed in Birmingham by John Baskerville in 1761; second that it appealed to children by having the animals speak in character, the Lion in regal style, the Owl with &#x27;pomp of phrase&#x27;; thirdly because it gathers into three sections fables from ancient sources, those that are more recent (including some borrowed from Jean de la Fontaine), and new stories of his own invention.

Thomas Bewick&#x27;s editions from Newcastle upon Tyne are equally distinguished for the quality of his woodcuts. The first of those under his name was the &quot;Select Fables in Three Parts&quot; published in 1784. This was followed in 1818 by &quot;The Fables of Aesop and Others&quot;. The work is divided into three sections: the first has some of Dodsley&#x27;s fables prefaced by a short prose moral; the second has &#x27;Fables with Reflections&#x27;, in which each story is followed by a prose and a verse moral and then a lengthy prose reflection; the third, &#x27;Fables in Verse&#x27;, includes fables from other sources in poems by several unnamed authors; in these the moral is incorporated into the body of the poem.

In the early 19th century authors turned to writing verse specifically for children and included fables in their output. One of the most popular was the writer of nonsense verse, Richard Scrafton Sharpe (died 1852), whose &quot;Old Friends in a New Dress: familiar fables in verse&quot; first appeared in 1807 and went through five steadily augmented editions until 1837. Jefferys Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Aesop in Rhyme, with some originals&quot;, first published in 1820, was as popular and also went through several editions. The versions are lively but Taylor takes considerable liberties with the story line. Both authors were alive to the over serious nature of the 18th century collections and tried to remedy this. Sharpe in particular discussed the dilemma they presented and recommended a way round it, tilting at the same time at the format in Croxall&#x27;s fable collection:

Sharpe&#x27;s limerick versions of Aesop&#x27;s fables appeared in 1887. This was in a magnificently hand-produced Arts and Crafts Movement edition, &quot;The Baby&#x27;s Own Aesop: being the fables condensed in rhyme with portable morals pictorially pointed by Walter Crane&quot;.

Some later prose editions were particularly notable for their illustrations. Among these was &quot;Aesop&#x27;s fables: a new version, chiefly from original sources&quot; (1848) by Thomas James, &#x27;with more than one hundred illustrations designed by John Tenniel&#x27;. Tenniel himself did not think highly of his work there and took the opportunity to redraw some in the revised edition of 1884, which also used pictures by Ernest Griset and Harrison Weir. Once the technology was in place for coloured reproductions, illustrations became ever more attractive. Notable early 20th century editions include V.S. Vernon Jones&#x27; new translation of the fables accompanied by the pictures of Arthur Rackham (London, 1912) and in the US &quot;Aesop for Children&quot; (Chicago, 1919), illustrated by Milo Winter.

The illustrations from Croxall&#x27;s editions were an early inspiration for other artefacts aimed at children. In the 18th century they appear on tableware from the Chelsea, Wedgwood and Fenton potteries, for example. 19th century examples with a definitely educational aim include the fable series used on the alphabet plates issued in great numbers from the Brownhills Pottery in Staffordshire. Fables were used equally early in the design of tiles to surround the nursery fireplace. The latter were even more popular in the 19th century when there were specially designed series from Mintons, Minton-Hollins and Maw &amp; Co. In France too, well-known illustrations of La Fontaine&#x27;s fables were often used on china.
==Religious themes==
In Classical times there was an overlap between fable and myth, especially where they had an aetiological function. Among those are two which deal with the difference between humans and animals. According to the first, humans are distinguished by their rationality. But in those cases where they have a bestial mentality, the explanation is that at creation animals were found to outnumber humans and some were therefore modified in shape but retained their animal souls.

Such early philosophical speculation was also extended to the ethical problems connected with divine justice. For example, it was perceived as disproportionate for an evil man to be punished by dying in a shipwreck when it involved many other innocent people. The god Hermes explained this to an objector by the human analogy of a man bitten by an ant and in consequence stamping on all those about his feet. Again, it was asked why the consequences of an evil deed did not follow immediately it was committed. Hermes was involved here too, since he records men&#x27;s acts on potsherds and takes them to Zeus piled in a box. The god of justice, however, goes through them in reverse order and the penalty may therefore be delayed. However, where the fault is perceived as an act of defiance, as happens in the fable of Horkos, retribution arrives swiftly.

Some fables may express open scepticism, as in the story of the man marketing a statue of Hermes who boasted of its effectiveness. Asked why he was disposing of such an asset, the huckster explains that the god takes his time in granting favours while he himself needs immediate cash. In another example, a farmer whose mattock has been stolen goes to a temple to see if the culprit can be found by divination. On his arrival he hears an announcement asking for information about a robbery at the temple and concludes that a god who cannot look after his own must be useless. But the contrary position, against reliance on religious ritual, was taken in fables like Hercules and the Wagoner that illustrate the proverb &quot;god helps those who help themselves&quot;. The story was also to become a favourite centuries later in Protestant England, where one commentator took the extreme position that to neglect the necessity of self-help is &quot;blasphemy&quot; and that it is &quot;a great sin for a man to fail in his trade or occupation by running often to prayers&quot;.

As the fables moved out of the Greek-speaking world and were adapted to different times and religions, it is notable how radically some fables were reinterpreted. Thus one of the fables collected under the title of the Lion&#x27;s share and originally directed against tyranny became in the hands of Rumi a parable of oneness with the God of Islam and obedience to divine authority. In the Jewish &#x27;fox fables&#x27; of Berechiah ha-Nakdan, the humorous account of the hares and the frogs was made the occasion to recommend trust in God, while Christian reinterpretation of animal symbolism in Mediaeval times turned The Wolf and the Crane into a parable of the rescue of the sinner&#x27;s soul from Hell.

In Mediaeval times too, fables were collected for use in sermons, of which Odo of Cheriton&#x27;s &quot;Parobolae&quot; is just one example. At the start of the Reformation, Martin Luther followed his example in the work now known as the Coburg Fables. Another source of Christianized fables was in the emblem books of the 16th–17th centuries. In Georgette de Montenay&#x27;s &quot;Emblemes ou devises chrestiennes&quot; (1571), for example, the fable of The Oak and the Reed was depicted in the context of the lines from the Magnificat, &quot;He hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree&quot; (Luke 1.52, AV).

Once the fables were perceived as primarily for the instruction of children, a new generation of Christian writers began putting their own construction on them, often at odds with their original interpretation. An extreme example occurs in a compilation called &quot;Christian Fables&quot; from the Victorian era, where The North Wind and the Sun is referred to Biblical passages in which religion is compared to a cloak. Therefore, says the author, one should beware of abandoning one&#x27;s beliefs under the sun of prosperity. Demonstrably, the essence of fables is their adaptability. Beginning two and a half millennia ago with aetiological solutions to philosophical problems, fresh religious applications were continuing into the present.

==Dramatised fables==
The success of La Fontaine&#x27;s fables in France started a European fashion for creating plays around them. The originator was Edmé Boursault, with his five-act verse drama &quot;Les Fables d&#x27;Esope&quot; (1690), later retitled &quot;Esope à la ville&quot; (Aesop in town). Such was its popularity that a rival theatre produced Eustache Le Noble&#x27;s &quot;Arlaquin-Esope&quot; in the following year. Boursault then wrote a sequel, &quot;Esope à la cour&quot; (Aesop at court), a heroic comedy that was held up by the censors and not produced until after his death in 1701. Other 18th-century imitations included Jean-Antoine du Cerceau&#x27;s &quot;Esope au collège&quot; (1715), where being put in charge of a school gives the fabulist ample opportunity to tell his stories, and Charles-Étienne Pesselier&#x27;s &quot;Esope au Parnasse&quot; (1739), a one-act piece in verse.

&quot;Esope à la ville&quot; was written in French alexandrine couplets and depicted a physically ugly Aesop acting as adviser to Learchus, governor of Cyzicus under King Croesus, and using his fables as satirical comments on those seeking his favour or to solve romantic problems. One of the problems is personal to Aesop, since he is betrothed to the governor&#x27;s daughter, who detests him and has a young admirer with whom she is in love. There is very little action, the play serving as a platform for the recitation of free verse fables at frequent intervals. These include The Fox and the Weasel, The Fox and the Mask, The Belly and the Other Members, the Town Mouse and the Country Mouse, the Fox and the Crow, the Crab and her Daughter, The Frog and the Ox, the Cook and the Swan, The Wolf and the Lamb, The Mountain in Labour, and The Man with two Mistresses. Two others – The Nightingale, The Lark and the Butterfly – appear original to the author, while a third, The Doves and the Vulture, is in fact an adapted version of The Frogs and the Sun.

&quot;Esope à la cour&quot; is more of a moral satire, most scenes being set pieces for the application of fables to moral problems, but to supply romantic interest Aesop&#x27;s mistress Rhodope is introduced. Among the sixteen fables included, only four derive from La Fontaine – The Heron and the Fish, the Lion and the Mouse, the Dove and the Ant, the Sick Lion – while a fifth borrows a moral from another of his but alters the details, and a sixth has as apologue a maxim of Antoine de La Rochefoucauld. After a modest few performances, the piece later grew in popularity and remained in the repertory until 1817. Boursault&#x27;s play was also influential in Italy and twice translated. It appeared from Bologna in 1719 under the title &quot;L&#x27;Esopo in Corte&quot;, translated by Antonio Zaniboni, and as &quot;Le Favole di Esopa alla Corte&quot; from Venice in 1747, translated by Gasparo Gozzi. The same translator was responsible for a version of &quot;Esope à la ville&quot; (&quot;Esopo in città&quot;, Venice, 1748); then in 1798 there was an anonymous Venetian three-act adaptation, &quot;Le Favole di Esopa, ossia Esopo in città&quot;. In England the play was adapted under the title &quot;Aesop&quot; by John Vanbrugh and first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1697, remaining popular for the next twenty years.

In the 20th century individual fables by Aesop began to be adapted to animated cartoons, most notably in France and the United States. Cartoonist Paul Terry began his own series, called &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot;, in 1921 but by the time this was taken over by Van Beuren Studios in 1928 the story lines had little connection with any fable of Aesop&#x27;s. In the early 1960s, animator Jay Ward created a television series of short cartoons called &quot;Aesop and Son&quot; which were first aired as part of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;. Actual fables were spoofed to result in a pun based on the original moral. Two fables are also featured in the 1971 TV movie &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; in the US. Here Aesop is a black story teller who relates two turtle fables, The Tortoise and the Eagle and the Tortoise and the Hare to a couple of children who wander into an enchanted grove. The fables themselves are shown as cartoons.

Between 1989 and 1991, fifty Aesop-based fables were reinterpreted on French television as and later issued on DVD. These featured a cartoon in which the characters appeared as an assembly of animated geometric shapes, accompanied by Pierre Perret&#x27;s slang versions of La Fontaine&#x27;s original poem. In 1983 there was an extended manga version of the fables made in Japan, &quot;Isoppu monogatari&quot;, and there has also been a Chinese television series for children based on the stories.

There have also been several dramatic productions for children based on elements of Aesop&#x27;s life and including the telling of some fables, although most were written as purely local entertainments. Among these was Canadian writer Robertson Davies&#x27; &quot;A Masque of Aesop&quot; (1952), which was set at his trial in Delphi and allows the defendant to tell the fables &quot;The Belly and the Members&quot;, &quot;The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Cock and the Jewel&quot; while challenging prevailing social attitudes.

==Musical treatments==
While musical settings of La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables began appearing in France within a few decades of their publication, it was not until the 19th century that composers began to take their inspiration directly from Aesop. One of the earliest was Charles Valentin Alkan&#x27;s &quot;Le festin d&#x27;Ésope&quot; (&quot;Aesop&#x27;s Feast&quot;, 1857), a set of piano variations in which each is said to depict a different animal or scene from Aesop&#x27;s fables. In Victorian England there were several piano arrangements of fables versified (with no particular skill) by their composers. 1847 saw the anonymous &quot;Selection of Aesop&#x27;s Fables Versified and Set to Music with Symphonies and Accompaniments for the Piano Forte&quot;, which contained 28 fables. It was followed in that same year by Olivia Buckley Dussek&#x27;s selection, illustrated by Thomas Onwhyn. Twelve were also set by W. Langton Williams () in his &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables, versified &amp; arranged for the piano forte&quot; (London, 1870s), the jocular wording of which was strongly deprecated by &quot;The Musical Times&quot;.

More were to follow in the 20th century, with seven settings in Mabel Wood Hill&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables Interpreted Through Music&quot; (New York, 1920), with the fable&#x27;s moral at the head of each piece. Many of these works were specifically aimed at young people. They also included Edward Hughes&#x27; &quot;Songs from Aesop&#x27;s fables&quot; for children&#x27;s voices and piano (1965) and Arwel Hughes&#x27;s similarly titled work for unison voices. More recently, the American composer Robert J. Bradshaw (b.1970) dedicated his 3rd Symphony (2005) to the fables with a programme note explaining that the work&#x27;s purpose &quot;is to excite young musicians and audiences to take an interest in art music&quot;. Five more fables set for choir are featured in Bob Chilcott&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (2008).

Werner Egk&#x27;s early settings in Germany were aimed at children too. His &quot;Der Löwe und die Maus&quot; (The Lion and the Mouse 1931) was a singspiel drama for small orchestra and children&#x27;s choir; aimed at 12- to 14-year-olds, it was built on an improvisation by the composer&#x27;s own children. He followed this with &quot;Der Fuchs und der Rabe &quot; (The Fox and the Crow) in 1932. Hans Poser&#x27;s &quot;Die Fabeln des Äsop&quot; (O 28, 1956) was set for accompanied men&#x27;s chorus and uses Martin Luther&#x27;s translation of six. Others who have set German texts for choir include Herbert Callhoff (1963) and Andre Asriel (1972).

The commonest approach in building a musical bridge to children has involved using a narrator with musical backing. Following the example of Sergei Prokoviev in &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (1936), Vincent Persichetti set six for narrator and orchestra in his &quot;Fables&quot; (O 23 1943). Richard Maltz also composed his &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (1993) to introduce the instruments of the orchestra to elementary students and to teach them about the elements of music, and Daniel Dorff&#x27;s widely performed &quot;3 Fun Fables&quot; (1996) has contrasting instruments interpreting characters: in &quot;The Fox and the Crow&quot; it is trumpet and contrabass; in &quot;The Dog and Its Reflection&quot; it is trombone and violin, harp and percussion; in &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot; it is contrabassoon and clarinet. Others simply adapt the narrator&#x27;s voice to a musical backing. They include Scott Watson&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; and Anthony Plog&#x27;s set of five for narrator, horn and piano (1989).

A different strategy is to adapt the telling to popular musical genres. Australian musician David P Shortland chose ten fables for his recording &quot;Aesop Go HipHop&quot; (2012), where the stories are given a hip hop narration and the moral is underlined in a lyrical chorus. The American William Russo&#x27;s approach to popularising his &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (1971) was to make of it a rock opera. This incorporates nine, each only introduced by the narrator before the music and characters take over. Instead of following the wording of one of the more standard fable collections, as other composers do, the performer speaks in character. Thus in &quot;The Crow and the Fox&quot; the bird introduces himself with, &quot;Ahm not as pretty as mah friends and I can&#x27;t sing so good, but, uh, I can steal food pretty goddam good!&quot; Other composers who have created operas for children have been Martin Kalmanoff in &quot;Aesop the fabulous fabulist&quot; (1969), David Ahlstom in his one-act &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (1986), and David Edgar Walther with his set of four &quot;short operatic dramas&quot;, some of which were performed in 2009 and 2010. There have also been local ballet treatments of the fables for children in the US by such companies as Berkshire Ballet and Nashville Ballet.

A musical, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; by British playwright Peter Terson, first produced in 1983, was performed by the Isango Portobello company, directed by Mark Dornford-May at the Fugard Theatre in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2010. The play tells the story of the black slave Aesop, who learns that freedom is earned and kept through being responsible. His teachers are the animal characters he meets on his journeys. The fables they suggest include the Tortoise and the Hare, the Lion and the Goat, the Wolf and the Crane, the Frogs Who Desired a King and three others, brought to life through a musical score featuring mostly marimbas, vocals and percussion. A colourful treatment was Brian Seward&#x27;s &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fabulous Fables&quot; (2009) in Singapore, which mixes a typical musical with Chinese dramatic techniques.

Use of other languages elsewhere in the world have included a setting of four Latin texts in the Czech composer Ilja Hurník&#x27;s &quot;Ezop&quot; for mixed choir and orchestra (1964) and the setting of two as a Greek opera by Giorgos Sioras (b. 1952) in 1998. And in 2010 Lefteris Kordis launched his &#x27;Aesop Project&#x27;, a setting of seven fables which mixed traditional East Mediterranean and Western Classical musical textures, combined with elements of jazz. After an English recitation by male narrator, a female singer&#x27;s rendition of the Greek wording was accompanied by an octet.

<doc id="240756" wikidata="Q2636946" url="?curid=240756" title="Penny Red">
<text>The Penny Red was a British postage stamp, issued in 1841. It succeeded the Penny Black and continued as the main type of postage stamp in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until 1879, with only minor changes to the design during that time. The colour was changed from black to red because of difficulty in seeing a cancellation mark on the Penny Black; a black cancellation mark was readily visible on a Penny Red.

==History==
Initially, some of the same plates used to print the Penny Black were used to print the Penny Red. About 21 billion Penny Reds were printed by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon &amp; Co. The stamps were printed in sheets of 240 (20 rows of 12 stamps), so one row cost 1 shilling and a complete sheet one pound. This configuration of 240 stamps per sheet continued with all low-value British postage stamps issued until decimalisation in 1971, when the sheet size was changed to 200 (20 rows of 10 stamps), making the lowest value denomination (half new penny) one pound per sheet. The sheets had no perforations and stamps had to be cut from the sheet using scissors, as with the Penny Black and the early printings of the Two pence blue.

Each stamp had unique letters AA, AB etc. in its lower corners, so that its position on the plate could be identified:
The upper corners were occupied by stars.

Perforations, in an experimental gauge 16, first came into use in 1850 and were officially adopted in 1854, also in gauge 16. The experimental perforated issue can be distinguished from the general issue as the latter was applied to a stamp that used a different alphabet type for the identifying letters. In January 1855, the perforation size was changed from 16 to 14 as it was found that the sheets were coming apart too easily; the reduced size allowed the sheets to remain intact until pressure was applied to force the separation. The upper corners of each stamp were now occupied by the same identifying letters in reverse.

==Plate numbers==
On 1 April 1864, the stamp was issued with the plate number engraved in the design, in the left and right side lace work. At this time, the stars in the top corners were also replaced with the same check letters as used in the lower corners, but in reverse order.

Because of wear, over 400 different plates were used to print the Penny Red. Two different basic watermarks were used for the paper, small crown (on the early issues) and large crown, introduced on 15 May 1855. The first stamps printed on the large crown watermarked paper showed two small vertical lines in the central portion of the crown (Type 1). Later printings showed a revised watermark on which these central lines are not present (Type 2).

Stamps from some of the individual plate numbers, such as plate 77, are very rare and in 2016, an example from this plate was auctioned for £495,000.

==Withdrawal==
The era of the Penny Red came to its close at the end of 1879, along with Perkins Bacon&#x27;s contract. It was superseded by the Penny Venetian Red printed by De La Rue, which was in use for a little over a year before being succeeded in turn by the long-lived Penny Lilac. Since then, the stamp has become in demand amongst stamp collectors.

<text>A humbucker, humbucking pickup, or double coil, is a guitar pickup that uses two wire coils to cancel out noisy interference from coil pickups. Humbucking coils are also used in dynamic microphones to cancel electromagnetic hum. Humbuckers are one of two main types of guitar pickups. The other is called a single coil.

== History ==
The &quot;humbucking coil&quot; was invented in 1934 by Electro-Voice, an American professional audio company based in South Bend, Indiana, that Al Kahn and Lou Burroughs incorporated in 1930 for the purpose of manufacturing portable public address equipment, including microphones and loudspeakers.

The twin coiled guitar pickup invented by Arnold Lesti in 1935 is arranged as a humbucker, and the patent USRE20070 describes the noise cancellation and current summation principles of such a design. This &quot;Electric Translating Device&quot; employed the solenoid windings of the pickup to magnetize the steel strings by means of switching on a short D.C. charge before switching over to amplification.

In 1938, A.F. Knoblaugh invented a pickup for stringed instruments involving two stacked coils described in . This pickup was to be used in pianos, since he was working for Baldwin Piano at the time.

The 1939 April edition of &quot;Radio Craft Magazine&quot; shows how to construct a guitar pickup made with two identical coils wrapped around self-magnetized iron cores, where one is then flipped over to create a reverse-wound, reverse-polarity, humbucking orientation. The iron cores of these pickups were magnetized to have their north–south poles at the opposite ends of the core, rather than the now more common top-bottom orientation.

To overcome the hum problem for guitars, a humbucking pickup was invented by Seth Lover of Gibson under instruction of then-president Ted McCarty. About the same time, Ray Butts developed a similar pickup, the Filter&#x27;Tron, that was taken up by Gretsch guitars. Although Gibson&#x27;s patent was filed almost two years before Gretsch&#x27;s, their patent was issued four weeks after Gretsch&#x27;s. Both patents describe a reverse-wound and reverse-polarity pair of coils.

A successful early humbucking pickup was the type which is nowadays known as the &quot;PAF&quot; (literally &quot;Patent Applied For&quot;) invented by Seth Lover in 1955. Because of this, and because of its use on the Gibson Les Paul guitar, popularization of the humbucker is strongly associated with Gibson, although humbuckers had been used in many different guitar designs by other manufacturers before. Rickenbacker offered dual coil pickups arranged in a humbucking pattern beginning in late 1953 but dropped the design in 1954 due to the perceived distorted sound, which had stronger mid-range presence.

The Gibson Les Paul was the first guitar to use humbuckers in large-scale production. Over the following decades, variants of practically every type of electric guitar have also been equipped with humbuckers, even types which are traditionally associated with single-coil pickups, like Fender Stratocasters and Telecasters.
In particular, the replacement of the bridge pickup in a Stratocaster-type guitar with a humbucker, resulting in a pickup configuration noted as H-S-S (starting at bridge pickup: H for humbucker, S for single coil) has gained much popularity. Guitars in this configuration are sometimes referred to as &quot;Fat Strats&quot;, because of the &quot;fatter&quot;, &quot;rounder&quot; tone offered by the humbucking pickup, and are also closely related to the &quot;Superstrat&quot; style of guitar.

== Function ==
In any magnetic pickup, a vibrating guitar string, magnetized by a fixed magnet within the pickup, induces an alternating voltage across its coil. However, wire coils also make excellent antennas and are therefore sensitive to electromagnetic interference caused by alternating magnetic fields from mains wiring (mains hum) and electrical appliances like transformers, motors, and computer screens, especially older CRT monitors. Guitar pickups reproduce this noise, which can be quite audible, sounding like a constant hum or buzz. This is most noticeable when using distortion, fuzz, compressors, or other effects which, by adding gain to low-level signals, reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore amplify the unwanted interference relative to the signal from the strings.

Humbuckers work by pairing a coil that has the &quot;north&quot; poles of its magnets oriented &quot;up&quot; (toward the strings) with another coil alongside it with the &quot;south&quot; pole of its magnets oriented up. By connecting the coils together out of phase, the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation: the string signals from both coils add up instead of canceling because the magnets are placed in opposite polarity. This dramatically improves the signal-to-noise ratio. The technique has something in common with what electrical engineers call &quot;common-mode rejection&quot;, and is also found in the balanced lines used in audio equipment. By convention, both humbucker coils are wound counterclockwise. The coils can be connected in series or in parallel in order to achieve this hum-cancellation effect, but humbucker pickups tend to be connected in series because that doubles the signal of the strings while keeping the hum reduced. Some types of humbucker pickups can be manually split (with a switch or within the pickup selector) so that only one coil is active.


== Alternative designs ==
=== Mini-humbuckers ===

Slightly smaller than a traditional humbucker/double coil form factor.

=== Single coil form factor humbuckers ===

Many guitars feature cavities only for single-coil pickups. Installing full/double-sized humbuckers in this type of guitar requires additional routing of the woodwork, and/or cutting of the pickguard if the instrument has one. Many pickup manufacturers now produce humbucking pickup designs in a form factor that can be retrofit in place of a single coil. Many different kinds of &quot;mini-humbuckers&quot; are available from numerous manufacturers, and they produce a wide range of different tones.

=== &quot;Hot Rails&quot; style ===
Not to be confused with the full size rail design.

The origins of the hot rail/blade design are contested, with Joe Barden being quoted in Jan 1989 Guitar World magazine as claiming to having invented the design in late 1983. The US patent for the L-500 attributes the hot rail design to Bill Lawrence.

Two flat vertical magnetically conductive blades are placed side by side within half the width of a typical fender strat/telecaster sized single coil.

Both &quot;blades/rails&quot; pass under all strings and placed lengthwise, each with its own winding around one rail/blade, and a magnet placed directly under and contacting the two blades.

Similar to full/double size hum bucking designs, one coil is reverse wound to cancel hum.

=== Stacked coils ===
Fender came out with their Fender Noiseless Pickups, a stacked bobbin design, around 1998.

Fender&#x27;s Noiseless pickups utilize two separate coils one on top of another, wound with one coil reverse wound to cancel hum, around a common set of magnetic pole pieces commonly referred to as the &quot;bobbin&quot;. These &quot;stacked&quot; humbuckers were in the same form factor as a traditional single coil style. Though cancelling hum while preserving the original single coil appearance, stacked designs can sacrifice some of the &quot;bite&quot; in higher frequencies partially due to capacitative effect of closely/machine wound coils
as well as other tonal differences resulting from the second coil having the magnet through it also.

In some designs one of the coils simply has no magnet, or is magnetically isolated. The inverted signal of this coil only serves to cancel out the hum picked up by the other coil, with the actual string signal remaining unaffected. This is often used on bass guitars, where the type of pickup used has a greater effect on the instrument&#x27;s overall sound, and the lower range of notes and their fundamental frequencies can match frequencies typically more heavily affected by hum. This is often called a &quot;stacked&quot; pickup, because the coils are most often &quot;stacked&quot; vertically, with the coil containing magnets placed closer to the strings.

=== Rail Humbuckers (Full Size)===
Another design known as the rail humbucker features a single magnetic component spanning across the entire string width of the instrument. These pickups are similar in size to single and double coil pickup, replacing the 6 slugs/magnets per coil. This is sometimes expanded into a double sized &quot;quadrail&quot;, or double humbucker, effectively combining 4 coils connected together to produce an extremely high-output pickup. The Kent Armstrong &quot;Motherbucker&quot; is an example of such an overpowered pickup.

The same type of rails can also be found in a normal-size humbucker. Heavy metal guitarist Dimebag Darrell made heavy use of this type of pickup wired in the bridge position. These tend to have a higher output and bass response than the single coil-sized versions. DiMarzio has designed and sold many such pickups.

=== Coil splitting and coil taps ===
Some guitars which have humbucking pickups feature &quot;coil splits&quot;, which allow the pickups to act as &quot;pseudo-single&quot; coils by either short-circuiting or bypassing one coil. The electrical circuit of the pickup is reduced to that of a true single coil so there is no hum canceling effect. Usually, this feature is activated using a miniature toggle switch or a DPDT push-pull switch mounted on a potentiometer. Some guitars (e.g., the Peavey T-60 and the Fender Classic Player Jaguar HH) make use of a variable coil split circuit that allows the guitarist to dial a variable amount of signal from the second coil, from purely single coil to full humbucker and everything in-between.

A similar option is a series/parallel switch, which in one position causes the coils to be connected in parallel rather than in series. This retains the humbucker&#x27;s noise-cancellation properties, and gives a sound closer to that of two single-coil pickups used together.

Coil splitting is often wrongly referred to as a &quot;coil tapping&quot;. Coil taps are most commonly found on single coil pickups, and involve adding an extra hook-up wire during manufacture of the pickup so the guitarist can choose to have all the windings of the pickup included in the circuit, for a fatter, higher output sound with more midrange, or switch the output to &#x27;Tap&#x27; into the windings at a point less than the full coil for a brighter, lower-output and cleaner sound. For example: a full pickup coil may be 10,000 turns of wire and the &quot;Tap&quot; may be at 8000 turns. Because of the confusion between coil splits and coil taps—and the rareness of coil taps in general—it is difficult to find tappable single-coil pickups for sale. However, pickup manufacturer Seymour Duncan offers tapped versions of many of their Telecaster and Stratocaster pickups.

The split single coil may bear little resemblance to popular single coil pickups such as those made by Fender and the P-90 made by Gibson, owing to other differences in pickup construction.

== Notable humbucker designs ==
* Gibson &quot;PAF&quot; - Seth Lover&#x27;s humbucker design. (&quot;Patent Applied For&quot;)
* Gretsch Filter&#x27;Tron – Ray Butts&#x27; first humbucker design
* Fender Wide Range – Fender&#x27;s first humbucker design, also by Seth Lover.
* Epiphone (and later Gibson) mini-humbucker – a smaller humbucker design with adjustable pole pieces. Designed by Gibson to reduce the size of their standard humbucker to fit into Epiphones that had been routed for the 1950s Epi &quot;New York&quot; pickup. They were later used most famously in the Gibson Les Paul Deluxe.
* Gibson Firebird pickup – inspired by the Epiphone pickup and shared its basic dimensions, but was different in terms of design, appearance, and tone; using single blade pole pieces.

== Other noise-reducing pickup designs ==
While the original humbucker remains the most common noise-reducing pickup design, inventors have tried many other approaches to reducing noise in guitar pickups.

=== Combining two single-coil pickups ===
Many instruments combine separate single-coil pickups in a hum reducing configuration by reversing the electrical phase of one of the pickups. This arrangement is similar to that of a humbucking pickup and effectively reduces noise. Examples of this include the Fender Jazz Bass, introduced in 1960, which used a pair of single-coil pickups, one near the bridge and another about halfway between the bridge and the neck, and many Stratocaster style guitars, which often have 3 pickups with the middle one reversed electrically and magnetically. The usual five-way selector switch provides two humbucking settings, using the reversed middle pickup in parallel with either the bridge or neck pickup.

If the pickups are wired in series instead of parallel, the resulting sound is close to that of a normal humbucker. It is even closer to a humbucker-type sound if the coils are placed closer together.

=== Proprietary designs ===
In 1957, Fender introduced a split pickup to its Precision Bass, where one coil is serving the E and A strings, and the other one the D and G strings. This configuration is often referred to as a &quot;split coil&quot; pickup, which should not be confused with the possibility of &quot;coil-splitting&quot; a regular humbucker, as discussed above. Both coils see nearly identical extraneous electromagnetic disturbances, and since they are wired in humbucking fashion, can effectively cancel them. However, the majority of the sound signal of any single note will mostly be generated by just one of the coils, so that output level and tonal qualities are much closer to a regular single-coil pickup. The resulting &quot;P-Style&quot; pickup is usually regarded as the main ingredient of the &quot;P-Bass&quot; sound, and many variants on the design are offered by many manufacturers. The concept was later developed into G&amp;L&#x27;s &quot;Z-coil&quot; pickup, which is used for standard guitars such as their Comanche model.

In 1985, Lace Music Products introduced the Lace Sensor pickup, which uses proprietary screened bobbins to reduce hum while preserving single-coil tone.

In the early 1980s DiMarzio introduced replacement pickups for Stratocaster and Telecaster guitars. These were of the stacked humbucker design, where the lower pickup coil functions solely to cancel hum.

The DiMarzio &quot;Super Distortion&quot; pickup, introduced in 1972, was the first after-market replacement guitar pickup. With its much-increased output compared to humbuckers installed in guitars of the time, it became an instant favourite of many hard-rock guitarists, and it remains a popular choice for a pickup upgrade decades later.
