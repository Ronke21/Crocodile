<text>The LA Galaxy (originally known as the Los Angeles Galaxy) are an American professional soccer club based in the Greater Los Angeles area. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Western Conference. The Galaxy began play in 1996 as one of the league&#x27;s ten charter members.

The Galaxy were founded in 1994 and are owned by Anschutz Entertainment Group (also owners of the Los Angeles Kings, as well as an interest in the Los Angeles Lakers). In their early years, the club played home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Since 2003, they have played at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. The team holds a rivalry with the San Jose Earthquakes in the California Clásico and used to play the SuperClasico against city rivals Chivas USA before that team folded in 2014. Following the league&#x27;s dissolution of Chivas USA, a new expansion team, Los Angeles FC (LAFC), was formed in 2014 and began play in 2018; the new L.A. rivalry was dubbed &quot;El Tráfico&quot;.

The franchise is Major League Soccer&#x27;s most successful team, with a record six MLS Cups and four additional appearances in the final, and won the Western Conference regular-season title eight times, join-record four Supporters&#x27; Shields, two U.S. Open Cups, and one CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup title. In 2017, the club added the dubious MLS Wooden Spoon to its trophy case for finishing at the bottom of the MLS table.

In 2007, the club made international headlines with the signing of English player David Beckham from Real Madrid, the most high-profile transaction with Major League Soccer to that point. The club has fielded other high-profile international players including Zlatan Ibrahimović, Steven Gerrard, Nigel de Jong, Robbie Keane, Ashley Cole, Marco Reus, Luis Hernández, Giovani dos Santos, Carlos Ruiz, Jonathan dos Santos, Jorge Campos, Javier Hernández, and American Landon Donovan, who is the all-time leading scorer for the club. In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated the club is the second most valuable in the league, worth about $480 million.

In 2024, the LA Galaxy won a record-extending sixth MLS Cup, and broke the record for most goals during a playoff campaign with 18 goals.

== History ==
=== Early years (1996–2000) ===
LA Galaxy is one of the 10 founding clubs in Major League Soccer. The name &quot;Galaxy&quot; was derived from Los Angeles being home to the &quot;stars&quot; of Hollywood. The team began competing in the first season of the then-new league, which took place in 1996.

In the inaugural season, the Galaxy finished first in the Western Conference and contested the first MLS Cup final, finishing as runners-up to D.C. United. In 1997, they started 1–7, but went 15–9 for the rest of the season to qualify for the playoffs. The Galaxy ended up second in their conference, losing to the Dallas Burn. In 1998, the Galaxy left off on a streak, eventually finishing 24–8. The Galaxy defeated the Dallas Burn, 9–3 on aggregate. They lost in the semi-final to the Chicago Fire, 5–1 on aggregate.

The Galaxy again finished first in the Western Conference in 1999, with a final record of 20–12, with a win in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, but lost to D.C. United again 2–0. The 2000 season had the Galaxy in second in the Western Division, at 14–10–8. Despite this, they lost to the Kansas City Wizards after a tied aggregate and a sudden-death game. Los Angeles won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup that same year, one of three American clubs to win the tournament.

2001 was another successful year for Los Angeles, winning the Open Cup and scoring 1,000 all-time points, and with Cobi Jones scoring the 300th goal, but again they fell short by being defeated by Landon Donovan and the San Jose Earthquakes. Again the club clinched first in the Western Conference with a 16–9–3 record, their fifth time being first. Los Angeles were to take part in FIFA&#x27;s Club World Cup as Concacaf champions from the previous year, but the tournament was canceled that year.

=== First MLS Cup (2002) ===
In 2002, the Galaxy won their first MLS Cup in the club&#x27;s fourth appearance by defeating the New England Revolution 1–0. In 2003, the Galaxy finished fourth playing more away games due to stadium construction, with the possible existing obstacles, the team finished 9–12–9. The Galaxy bounced back by gaining second with an 11–9–10 record. They lost to the Wizards in the final, 0–2.

In 2005, the Galaxy acquired Landon Donovan from San Jose. The franchise won the Open Cup again ending with a record of 13–13–6. Having qualified for the playoffs for the 2005 season, the Galaxy has been the only team to appear in the playoffs in all of the league&#x27;s first ten seasons. They won the 2005 MLS Cup, defeating the New England Revolution in extra time, 1–0.

The 2006 season began on March 16 with the sudden death of Doug Hamilton, the team&#x27;s 43-year-old general manager, who suffered a heart attack on board a plane carrying the team back from Costa Rica where they had played Saprissa in the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. The team finished fifth in the Western Conference, eliminating them from playoff contention for the first time since the league&#x27;s inception. Midway through the season, Steve Sampson was sacked as head coach, replaced by Frank Yallop. The team managed to make a deep run to the U.S. Open Cup final, but lost 3–1 against the Chicago Fire.

=== Beckham era (2007–2012) ===
In March 2007, Herbalife signed a five-year deal with the Galaxy, worth between $4–5 million a year, to be the club&#x27;s primary shirt sponsor. Four months later, the club signed David Beckham from Real Madrid. His debut was made at Home Depot Center before a record crowd of nearly 35,000, including many celebrities, coming on in the 78th minute in a 1–0 loss to Chelsea in a match during the World Series of Football tournament. The match brought unprecedented TV coverage from ESPN, who used 19 cameras to cover it, including one trained only on Beckham, even when he was on the bench. In that season&#x27;s SuperLiga, LA reached the final but lost to Mexican side Pachuca on penalties after extra time. LA nearly made the end-of-season play-offs, but were eliminated following a 1–0 loss to the Chicago Fire. In the off-season, Cobi Jones retired and, amidst rumors that he was going to be sacked, Yallop resigned as head coach following a friendly match at Home Depot Center. The San Jose Earthquakes bought out his contract and offered a third round draft pick to the Galaxy as compensation to hire Yallop as their new head coach. Yallop was replaced at LA by Ruud Gullit, who signed a three-year contract with the club, making him the highest paid coach in MLS history. Cobi Jones returned as assistant coach. LA went on a promotional tour of Australia and New Zealand, setting attendance records in both countries. 80,295 people showed up at Stadium Australia for the match between Sydney FC and LA Galaxy, which the home side won 5–3. They also played a tour of Asia, and competed in the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Honolulu, finishing third after beating Sydney 2–1 in the third-place match.

In the 2008 MLS season, LA went on a seven-game winless streak that saw them drop from first place in the Western Conference to outside playoff contention, prompting the resignation of manager Ruud Gullit and firing of general manager Alexi Lalas. Gullit was replaced by Bruce Arena, who was unable to lead LA into a play-off spot, for the third-straight season.
In the following off-season, both club captain David Beckham and vice-captain Landon Donovan were involved in loan deals with European clubs until the beginning of the new MLS season; Beckham to Milan in Italy and Donovan to German club Bayern Munich. Donovan was seeking a permanent transfer to Munich, while Beckham was expected to return to LA in March, prior to the 2009 season. Beckham went on to seek a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup, and Milan made a bid for the player that was rejected by LA. One day before his loan deal was to expire, Milan and LA reached an agreement to allow Beckham to stay in Italy until the conclusion of the &quot;Rossoneri&#x27;s&quot; season in June, before returning to LA in July. Donovan was not offered a contract by Bayern, and returned to the U.S. in time for the beginning of the 2009 MLS season. In the book &quot;The Beckham Experiment&quot; by Grant Wahl, Donovan openly criticized Beckham for his handling of the loan deals. Beckham and Donovan would later reconcile upon Beckham&#x27;s return to LA in July.

LA finished the 2009 season top of the Western Conference and runners-up in the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield, qualifying for the 2009 MLS Cup. They reached the final by beating Chivas USA 3–2 on aggregate in the quarter-final, and Houston Dynamo 2–0, after extra time, in the semi-final. In the final they drew 1–1 with Real Salt Lake at Qwest Field in Seattle, but lost 5–4 on penalties. By reaching the final, they qualified for the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League Preliminary Round.

After the 2009 success, both Donovan and Beckham again went out on second loan spells. Donovan went to Everton while Beckham returned to Milan, where he ruptured his Achilles tendon and therefore missed his chance at playing in the World Cup for England and subsequently missing most of the Galaxy&#x27;s 2010 season.

In 2010, the Galaxy stayed at the top of the table and won the Supporters&#x27; Shield, the first time MLS played a balanced schedule. They then lost to FC Dallas in the Western Conference Final, one game away from making another appearance at MLS Cup.
In 2011, a year in which they added the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer Robbie Keane, they won their fourth Supporters&#x27; Shield with two games remaining, becoming the third-straight team to win consecutive Shields while amassing the second-best points total in MLS history. They followed this up with their third MLS Cup, defeating the Houston Dynamo 1–0 in the final. The 2011 MLS Cup was the Galaxy&#x27;s first MLS Cup Victory in regulation. The 2002 and the 2005 MLS Cup wins were won in overtime.

In January 2012, after much speculation, Beckham signed a new two-year deal with LA to secure his short-term future at the club. Despite the new contract, Beckham confirmed in November 2012 that he would be leaving the Galaxy at the end of the 2012 MLS season. On December 1, 2012, the Galaxy won their second-straight MLS Cup victory over the Houston Dynamo, 3–1. Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez won the MLS MVP trophy, heading in the 1–1 equalizer in the 60th minute. That goal was quickly followed by a Donovan penalty kick, and Keane sealed the game with another penalty kick in stoppage time. In post-match interviews both Donovan and Beckham remained coy about their future MLS plans.

=== First to five league championships (2013–2016) ===

The Galaxy finished the 2013 season third in the Western Conference. They reached the conference semi-finals, where they lost 2–1 to Real Salt Lake. They also reached the semi-finals of the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League, but lost 3–1 on aggregate to Mexican team Monterrey.

Following the defeat to Seattle Sounders FC in the final game of the season with the Supporters&#x27; Shield on the line, the team entered the 2014 MLS playoffs defeating Real Salt Lake, advancing to face Seattle once again in the Western Conference Finals, advancing to the MLS Cup by away goals. They played the New England Revolution in the 2014 MLS Cup and won 2–1 in overtime, thereby becoming five-time champions, a league record. At the end of the season, longtime LA Galaxy and United States national team player Landon Donovan retired.

On January 7, 2015, the LA Galaxy announced the signing of long time Liverpool player Steven Gerrard to an 18-month Designated Player contract, reportedly worth $9 million. He joined the team in July 2015 following the end of the 2014–15 Premier League season, and made his debut in an International Champions Cup against Club América on July 11.

The club again made headlines by acquiring Mexican star and Barcelona academy product Giovani dos Santos in July as a designated player. Not since the days of Jorge Campos, Carlos Hermosillo and Luis Hernández in the late 1990s and early 2000s had the Galaxy had a notable Mexican player, let alone one in the prime of his career. Dos Santos made an impactful impression on the Galaxy early on, scoring on his club debut against Central FC in the CONCACAF Champions League and then in his league debut against the Sounders. In his first five club matches, he had a goal, an assist or both to total with four goals and five assists in that span.

=== Wooden Spoon and rebuilding (2016–2023) ===
Before the start of the 2016 season, it was announced that long-time servicing center-back Omar Gonzalez would leave the Galaxy after nine years to C.F. Pachuca.

On November 22, 2016, long-time general manager and head coach Bruce Arena left the club to begin his second stint as head coach of the United States national team, bringing most of the Galaxy&#x27;s coaching staff with him, including associate head coach Dave Sarachan. Arena was replaced as general manager by former Galaxy player Peter Vagenas, and as head coach by his LA Galaxy II counterpart, Curt Onalfo.

The front office constructed the team to rely on players from the academy and Galaxy II system. Multiple injuries exposed the naive roster construction, which included erratic performances by Jermaine Jones, and sparse production from Giovanni Dos Santos. With a 6–10–4 record, the Galaxy fired Curt Onalfo and replaced him with former head coach Sigi Schmid on July 27, 2017. Under Schmid, the club went 2–8–4 and finished the season in last place overall with a mark of 8–18–8. It was only the fourth time that the club failed to make the postseason, and the club&#x27;s first wooden spoon.
In March 2018, the team signed Zlatan Ibrahimović on a two-year, $3 million contract with targeted allocation money. The Swede made his debut in the inaugural &quot;El Tráfico&quot; match against LAFC, scoring two goals to end the game with the Galaxy coming from 0–3 down to win 4–3. One of the goals Ibrahimović scored in that game later received the MLS Goal of the Year award. Los Angeles throughout the season dealt with defensive struggles, and in their last match of the regular season, against Houston Dynamo, the Galaxy were defeated and once again missed the postseason.

After the 2018 season, the Galaxy ended Ibrahimović&#x27;s original deal and signed him to a new and higher salaried designated player contract. On March 1, 2019, the team announced they had exercised its one offseason Buyout of a Guaranteed Contract on Giovani dos Santos, thus releasing him from the team.

In the 2019 season, the Galaxy welcomed Guillermo Barros Schelotto to the club as head coach. The Galaxy also added a number of players, notably Uruguayan Diego Polenta, Argentine World Cup veteran Cristian Pavón, fellow Argentine Favio Álvarez and Mexican Uriel Antuna. With this, and the emergence of academy product Efraín Álvarez, the Galaxy placed fifth in the West and made the playoffs. The season was best remembered for Ibrahimović&#x27;s performances against LAFC, including a hat-trick at home in July and a brace in Banc of California Stadium that August. Ibrahimović finished the season with 30 goals, the second-highest mark in the season and third-highest total in league history (with the record being broken by LAFC&#x27;s Carlos Vela that year). In the playoffs, the Galaxy defeated Minnesota United FC 2–1 before falling to LAFC, 5–3. Ibrahimović left the club in November, and of the 2019 signings—most of them on loan—only Pavón returned for 2020.

Three years later, in December 2022, MLS sanctioned the Galaxy for the 2019 Pavón signing, stripping the club of $1 million in allocation money and suspending club president Chris Klein. Moreover, the club was not allowed to sign international players in the 2023 summer transfer window.

The club arranged for a transfer from La Liga club Sevilla, signing a three-year contract with Javier &quot;Chicharito&quot; Hernandez on January 21, 2020, and making him the highest-paid player in the league. At the end of the season, after failing to making the postseason, head coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto was fired, and replaced with Dominic Kinnear as interim manager. On January 5, the Galaxy announced Greg Vanney as the new manager.

Under Vanney, the Galaxy narrowly missed the MLS playoffs in 2021, finishing eighth in the Western Conference (15th overall). In 2022, the club showed marked improvement, punctuated by the continued improvement of Hernández (who scored 18 goals) and the signings of former Barcelona youth product Riqui Puig and European veteran Gastón Brugman. The Galaxy finished fourth in the West (eighth overall), their highest mark since 2016, and beat Nashville SC at home in the first round of the MLS Cup playoffs before falling again to their crosstown rivals LAFC in the conference semifinals, 3−2, at the last minute. Hernández was named the team&#x27;s player of the year that season.

In the offseason leading up to 2023, team president Chris Klein was suspended through the primary transfer window after undisclosed payments involving the team&#x27;s 2019 signing of Cristian Pavon, in which MLS reported that Pavon should have been classified as a designated player. The league&#x27;s sanctions on the Galaxy meant that the team could not make any international signings during the 2023 summer transfer window. Despite these punishments, Klein signed a multi-year extension with the team. In response, Galaxy supporter group leaders announced a unified boycott, refusing to attend any home games until Klein was removed from his position.

The Galaxy began 2023 with their worst start to a season in club history, winless in their first seven games while twice ending up at the bottom of the league&#x27;s overall standings. After a loss to Charlotte FC in May, Galaxy supporters were seen involved in a shouting match with manager Greg Vanney, who had assumed control of the team&#x27;s soccer operations in the wake of Klein&#x27;s suspension. In the aftermath, ESPN ranked the Galaxy 29 of 29 in their MLS power rankings, saying they were &quot;not a serious club&quot;.

On May 30, 2023, the Galaxy officially announced they had parted ways with Klein.

===MLS Cup championship return (2024–present)===
In 2024, the Galaxy would introduce top signings in attackers Joseph Paintsil and Gabriel Pec, while letting Douglas Costa and Chicharito leave the club. This marked a shift in philosophy from a club focused on signing world-famous players and toward one with lesser-known yet well-regarded players who could thrive in MLS. The Galaxy would narrowly miss out on finishing in first place to rivals LAFC, finishing on the same points total (64) than their local foes but losing on tiebreakers. During the regular season, the four-man attack of Riqui Puig, Serbian striker Dejan Joveljić, Paintsil and Pec provided 54 of the team&#x27;s 69 MLS goals, equaling their highest output since 1998 (matched in the MLS Cup-winning 2014 campaign). The Galaxy would defeat Colorado Rapids in a two-game first round series (scoring nine goals in the round), then beat Minnesota United by a 6−2 margin and the Seattle Sounders in a tightly contested 1–0 Western Conference final to advance to their first MLS Cup since 2014. Puig assisted Joveljić on the winning goal in the 85th minute; the next day, it was revealed that Puig had torn his ACL earlier in the game, thus ending his season. On December 7, the Galaxy defeated the New York Red Bulls 2–1 to win their sixth MLS Cup in club history, their first in exactly ten years. The Galaxy also recorded the most goals in playoffs history with 18 across the campaign.

== Colors and badge ==

The LA Galaxy&#x27;s current team colors are navy blue, gold, and white. The team&#x27;s primary uniform is white and the secondary uniform is blue. The colors were adopted to coincide with David Beckham&#x27;s arrival with the team in 2007 as part of an overall re-branding exercise spearheaded by then GM Alexi Lalas. Before 2007, the Galaxy played in various color combinations, usually comprising gold, teal green and white with black accents, and often highlighting an iconic sash design from the left shoulder and across the chest. Their original jersey, used in the inaugural 1996 MLS season, reflected the colors of the city of Los Angeles and featured black-and-teal halves, black sleeves with gold and red accents, black shorts and black socks.

The Galaxy have had two logos to date. The original brand was gold, teal and black, and featured the Galaxy wordmark superimposed over a golden swirl, with a stylized black outline. The logo was changed in 2007, again to coincide with David Beckham&#x27;s arrival, and now features a blue shield with a gold border, the LA Galaxy team name, and a quasar at the top of the crest.

The quasar, featured prominently on the LA Galaxy&#x27;s shield, was originally featured on the 1957 Seal of Los Angeles County, as well as the modified Seal of Los Angeles County, California.

The name &quot;Galaxy&quot; was created by Nike at the conception of the league; the apparel company was also the original uniform supplier for the team.

== Club operations ==
The Galaxy first turned a profit in 2003, becoming the first MLS team to do so. After the team moved into the new Home Depot Center, the team saw increased attendance, a doubling of revenue from sponsors, and revenues from parking and concessions.

A &quot;Forbes&quot; 2015 report ranked the LA Galaxy second in MLS in terms of annual revenue ($44 million) and in franchise value ($240 million). The Galaxy earn more in annual club sponsorship income ($14 million) and annual local TV rights ($5 million) than any other MLS team. The Galaxy have the highest annual revenue of any MLS team, the third highest revenue of any CONCACAF team, and the seventh highest revenue of any team in the Americas.

=== Kit sponsors ===

== Stadium ==
From 1996 to 2002, and for an El Tráfico exhibition game in 2023, the Galaxy played their home games at the 107,000-person capacity Rose Bowl in Pasadena, but often held U.S. Open Cup games at Titan Stadium on the campus of California State University, Fullerton. The Galaxy played 10 games in total at Titan Stadium; the U.S. Open Cup Final was held there in 2001 when the Galaxy won the tournament.
In 2003, the Galaxy moved to Dignity Health Sports Park (then known as the Home Depot Center, later known as StubHub Center), on the campus of California State University, Dominguez Hills in Carson, approximately ten miles south of downtown Los Angeles. The stadium is a 27,000-seat soccer-specific stadium, the second of its kind in MLS, but has hosted other sports such as rugby and American football. From 2005 to 2014, the Galaxy shared the stadium with their now-defunct league rivals Chivas USA, with whom they competed in the SuperClasico.

== Club culture ==

=== Cozmo ===

Cozmo is the Galaxy&#x27;s mascot. He has dark blue skin with yellow eyebrows and white eyes matching the Galaxy&#x27;s home uniform colors. He replaced the Galaxy&#x27;s original mascot, &quot;Twizzle&quot;, who also looked like it was from outer space but was more humanoid in form, wearing a space-man&#x27;s helmet and cape.

=== Galaxy Star squad ===
The Galaxy Star Squad is the official cheerleaders of the club. They often attend events hosted by the Galaxy, such as autograph sessions, and can be often seen around the stadium during game time giving away scarves and supporting the team.

=== Supporters ===
The Angel City Brigade was created in 2007 to help establish a festive and vibrant atmosphere in Dignity Health Sports Park for the Galaxy. They were originally located in section 121 in the General Admission area of the stadium.

The LA Riot Squad formed after a loss in the 2001 MLS Cup, when then-Galaxy keeper Kevin Hartman challenged a group of Galaxy fans to form a supporter group of 100 people by opening day of 2002. The reward if they were able to do this was a keg of beer. They are located in sections 137 and 138 in the General Admission area of the stadium.

Galaxians are the first and original supporter group of the LA Galaxy, having been established in 1996 during the Galaxy&#x27;s first season in MLS. They were originally located in section 124.

Galaxy Outlawz is the latest group started in 2019. They now join the Galaxians and the Angel City Brigade in the new safe standing section in the north end.

Victoria Block is the newest safe standing only section built in 2020 replacing all of the bleachers from sections 120 to 123 in the north end of the stadium. It is the new supporters only section and new home for the Galaxians, Angel City Brigade, and Galaxy Outlawz.

=== Ring of Honor ===


== Rivalries ==
===San Jose Earthquakes===

The Galaxy&#x27;s longest-running rivalry match is the California Clásico, played against the San Jose Earthquakes. It is considered among the fiercest and longest-running rivalries in American soccer. The intrastate rivalry dates to the founding of MLS, and their encounters in the MLS Cup playoffs and final. Some also cite that the rivalry developed in reflection of traditional Northern California—Southern California sports rivalries.

===Los Angeles FC===

When Los Angeles FC (LAFC) joined the league in 2018 as an expansion team, a new crosstown rivalry was born. The Galaxy&#x27;s current record vs LAFC, through 2022, is 7-5-5 (including 0-2 in the playoffs). Dubbed &quot;El Tráfico&quot;, the rivalry has become one of the most passionate in the league.

===Chivas USA===

From 2005 to 2014, the Galaxy were rivals with Chivas USA (now defunct), with whom they shared the same stadium, in the SuperClasico. This contest, with Chivas USA, was dominated by the Galaxy, who won 22 of the 34 encounters. The rivalry was the only intra-stadium rivalry in MLS until Chivas ceased operations at the end of the 2014 season.

== Broadcasting ==
From 2023, every Galaxy match is available via MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app. Prior to this international all-streaming deal, the Galaxy appeared on a number of TV stations in the Southern California area throughout its first 27 years of existence.

At the end of the 2011 season, the Galaxy announced a ten-year, $55 million deal with Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum), the most lucrative local media contract in MLS history, to begin at the end of the 2012 MLS season. Previously, Galaxy matches were televised regionally in English on Fox Sports West or Prime Ticket. While awaiting the launch of those networks, all 2012 English-language matches were broadcast on local outlet KDOC, with one match showcased on Time Warner Cable SportsNet near the end of the season. In Spanish, 2012 matches were shown on independent outlet KWHY with Adrian Garcia Marquez and Francisco Pinto commentating. Television commentary is now handled by Joe Tutino and former Galaxy player Cobi Jones, and the radio stream is broadcast on the club&#x27;s website.

Until they stopped broadcasting MLS in 2023, ESPN carried most games on its ESPN+ platform for out-of-market viewers, as well as showing nationally televised broadcasts on ESPN, ESPN2, or ABC. FOX Sports handles nationally televised broadcasts on Fox Sports 1, or the FOX. When Univisión broadcast a nationally televised game on its main network, UniMás, or TUDN, the match stream was also available on Twitter.

For the 2015 USL season, the Galaxy were placed in the Western Conference. On March 15, 2024 at 04:42 PM the team announced a partial relocation to Thousand Oaks, California and rebranded to Ventura County FC.

=== Academy ===
As part of its development program, the Galaxy operates an academy system with U-18 and U-16 teams competing in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, and U-14 and U-12 teams competing in Southern California Developmental Soccer Leagues (SCDSL). Recent academy graduates include: Jack McBean, Oscar Sorto, Jose Villarreal, Gyasi Zardes, Raul Mendiola, Bradford Jamieson IV, and Efraín Álvarez.

=== Alliance clubs ===
The LA Galaxy extended its youth development program and structure through the integration of existing youth clubs that have partnered under the LA Galaxy name. Known as the LA Galaxy Academy Alliance Clubs, they are located throughout Southern California, retain some autonomy and have access to LA Galaxy resources and outreach programs. One alliance club, LA Galaxy Orange County, has a men&#x27;s category competing in the United Premier Soccer League.

<doc id="241882" wikidata="Q3082937" url="?curid=241882" title="Franklin Edson">
<text>Franklin Edson (April 5, 1832 – September 24, 1904) was an American merchant who served as the 85th Mayor of New York from 1883 to 1884.

==Early life==
Edson was born in Chester, Vermont on April 5, 1832, where his father had a farm. A descendant of the Puritans, he was the son of Soviah (née Wilson) Edson and Opher Edson.

He was educated at the local schools and at the Chester Academy in Vermont.

==Career==

=== Business ===
At age twenty, Edson moved to Albany to work in his brother Cyrus&#x27; distillery, becoming a partner three years later.

He left the distillery after his brother&#x27;s death and started a produce business, which he relocated to New York City in 1866. His venture proved successful during the American Civil War, making Edson wealthy and enabling him to engage in civic, religious and charitable causes. He was an active Episcopalian and a member of Saint James Church, Fordham, in the Bronx.

In 1873, he became one of the city&#x27;s most important business leaders when he was appointed President of the New York Produce Exchange.

===Politics===
An anti-Tammany Democrat, in 1882 he was nominated for Mayor through the efforts of Tammany Hall boss John Murphy to avoid a Democratic Party split between organization loyalists and reformers. Upon taking office in 1883, he angered reformers by appointing Tammany men to key jobs, but he soon embraced civil service reform and other honest government measures.

During his term the Brooklyn Bridge was dedicated, the Manhattan Municipal Building was constructed, and work was completed on the city&#x27;s new water supply, the Croton Aqueduct. He appointed the commission responsible for the selection and location of public lands for parks in the Bronx, which came to include Van Cortlandt, Bronx, Pelham Bay, Crotona, Claremont and St. Mary&#x27;s Parks, and the Mosholu, Bronx River, Pelham, and Crotona Parkways.

After Edson split with Tammany the 1884 Democratic nomination for Mayor went to William Russell Grace, who had also preceded Edson as Mayor, and Edson retired from politics at the completion of his term in 1885.

After leaving the mayor&#x27;s office, Edson returned to his business interests and continued his philanthropic activities.

==Personal life==
In 1856, Edson was married to Frances Cameron &quot;Fannie&quot; Wood (1835–1893), the daughter of Benjamin Howland Wood. Fannie was the granddaughter of Jethro Wood, inventor of the cast-iron moldboard plow. They owned a homestead in Morris Heights, Bronx that consisted of three acres, a stately residence, stable and barn, which he exchanged for 247 Central Park West, two doors south of the corner of 85th Street, in 1893. Together, Fannie and Franklin were the parents of:

* Cyrus Edson (1857–1903), a doctor who married Virginia Churchill Paige (1853–1891). He served as the New York City Health Commissioner.
* Franklin (1859–1926), who married Elsie Squier.
* David Orr Edson (1862–1923), a doctor.
* Henry Townsend Edson (1864–1903), who married Margarita Diehl. In 1903, Henry Edson murdered his friend&#x27;s wife and then committed suicide.
* Edith Edson (b. 1870), who married Willis Benner.
* Robert S. (1873–1941), who married Fanny Ropes.
* Ethel Townsend Edson (b. 1877), who married Arthur Hoffman Van Brunt (b. 1865).

He died at his home in Manhattan on September 24, 1904. He was buried in Section 15, Lot 16 at Albany Rural Cemetery, Menands, New York.

===Legacy===
Edson Avenue in The Bronx is named for him.

<doc id="241883" wikidata="Q334990" url="?curid=241883" title="Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg">
<text>Lieutenant-General Bernard Cyril Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg, (21 March 1889 – 4 July 1963) was a British-born New Zealand soldier and Victoria Cross recipient, who served as the 7th governor-general of New Zealand from 1946 to 1952.

Freyberg served as an officer in the British Army during the First World War. He took part in the beach landings during the Gallipoli campaign and was the youngest general in the British Army during the First World War, later serving on the Western Front, where he was decorated with the Victoria Cross and three Distinguished Service Orders, making him one of the most highly decorated British Empire soldiers of the First World War. He liked to be in the thick of the action: Winston Churchill called him &quot;the Salamander&quot; due to his ability to pass through fire unharmed.

During the Second World War, he commanded the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in the Battle of Crete, the North African campaign and the Italian campaign. Freyberg was involved in the Allied defeat in the Battle of Greece, defeated again as the Allied commander in the Battle of Crete and performed successfully in the fighting in North Africa, commanding the 2nd New Zealand Division, including during the Second Battle of El Alamein and in the subsequent Tunisian campaign.

In Italy, he was defeated again at the Second Battle of Cassino as a corps commander but later relieved Padua and Venice and was one of the first to enter Trieste, where he confronted Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans. By the end of the Second World War, Freyberg had spent ten and a half years fighting the Germans.

==Early life==
The youngest of five children, all boys, Freyberg was born at 8 Dynevor Road, Richmond, Surrey, to James Freyberg and his second wife, Julia (née Hamilton) was of partial Austrian-German descent. He moved to New Zealand with his parents at the age of two.

He attended Wellington College from 1897 to 1904. A strong swimmer, he won the New Zealand 100-yards championship in 1906 and 1910.

In 1911, Freyberg was Second Lieutenant serving in C Company of the Hauraki Regiment. This company was based at Annandale, near Morrinsville, and during this time Freyberg served as locum for a local dentist. On 18 January 1912, Freyberg was gazetted into the 6th Hauraki Regiment. Freyberg later resigned and moved to Levin.

Freyberg left New Zealand in March 1914 for California. A 1942 &quot;Life&quot; magazine article claimed that Freyberg went to San Francisco and Mexico around this time, and was a captain under Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. Upon hearing of the outbreak of the war in Europe in August 1914, he travelled to Britain via Los Angeles (where he won a swimming competition) and New York (where he won a prizefight), to earn money to cross the United States and the Atlantic. Recent research indicates, however, that Freyberg never went to Mexico, that he spent most of his time in California as an oil field official living in Coalinga, that he left for the war by train from San Francisco and that he created the Mexico myth about himself shortly after arriving in Britain by spinning a yarn to a New Zealand journalist, perhaps hoping that some active service might help to secure a commission in the British forces.

==First World War==
Immediately on the outbreak of the First World War Freyberg went to England and volunteered for service. G. S. Richardson arranged for him to join the 7th &quot;Hood&quot; Battalion of the Royal Naval Brigade, and he was on the Belgian front in September 1914. In late 1914 Freyberg met Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, and persuaded him to grant him a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve commission in the &#x27;Hood&#x27; Battalion, part of the 2nd (Royal Naval) Brigade of the newly constituted Royal Naval Division.

In April 1915 Freyberg became involved in the Dardanelles campaign. On the night of 24 April, during the initial landings by Allied troops following the failed naval attempt to force the straits by sea, Freyberg volunteered to swim ashore in the Gulf of Saros. Once ashore, he began lighting flares so as to distract the defending Turkish forces from the real landings taking place at Gallipoli. Despite coming under heavy Turkish fire, he returned safely from this outing and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). He received serious wounds on several occasions and left the peninsula when his division evacuated in January 1916.

===Victoria Cross===
In May 1916 Freyberg was transferred to the British Army as a captain in the Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey) Regiment. However, he remained with the &#x27;Hood&#x27; Battalion as a seconded temporary major and went with them to France.

During the final stages of the Battle of the Somme, when commanding a battalion as a temporary lieutenant-colonel, he so distinguished himself in the capture of Beaucourt village that he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). On 13 November 1916 at Beaucourt-sur-Ancre, France, after Freyberg&#x27;s battalion had carried the initial attack through the enemy&#x27;s front system of trenches, he rallied and re-formed his own much disorganised men and some others, and led them on a successful assault of the second objective, during which he suffered two wounds, but remained in command and held his ground throughout the day and the following night. When reinforced the next morning, he attacked and captured a strongly fortified village, taking 500 prisoners. Although wounded twice more, the second time severely, Freyberg refused to leave the line until he had issued final instructions. The full citation for the award, published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in December 1916, describes the events as follows:

During his time on the Western Front Freyberg continued to lead by example. His bold leadership had a cost: Freyberg received nine wounds during his service in France, and men who served with him later in his career said hardly a part of his body did not have scars.

Freyberg gained promotion to the rank of temporary brigadier general (although he still had the permanent rank of only captain) and took command of the 173rd (3/1st London) Brigade, part of the 58th (2/1st London) Division, in April 1917, which reportedly made him the youngest general officer in the British Army. He was awarded a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year. In September a shell exploding at his feet inflicted the worst of his many wounds, having &quot;been hit in five places by the heavy shell that had burst at his feet, right through a lung in one place, and in his thigh was a hole the size of a fist&quot;. He was evacuated to Bryanston Square Hospital, London, where he remained for the next three months. Initially, it was feared that he would &quot;lose a leg – or even his life&quot;.

When he resumed duty in January 1918, the same month in which he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel, he took command of the 88th Infantry Brigade, part of the 29th Division, performing with distinction during the German spring offensives of March–April 1918. He won a bar to his DSO in September that year. Freyberg ended the war by leading a cavalry squadron detached from the 7th Dragoon Guards to seize a bridge at Lessines, which was achieved one minute before the armistice with Germany came into effect, thus earning him a second bar to the DSO. By the end of the war, Freyberg had added the French Croix de Guerre to his name, as well receiving five mentions in despatches after his escapade at Saros. With his VC and three DSOs, he ranked among the most highly decorated British Empire soldiers of the First World War.

==Interbellum==
Early in 1919 Freyberg was granted a Regular Army commission in the Grenadier Guards and settled into peacetime soldiering, as well as attempts to swim the English Channel. He attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1920 to 1921. From 1921 to 1925 he was a staff officer in the headquarters of the 44th (Home Counties) Division. He suffered health problems arising from his many wounds, and as part of his convalescence he visited New Zealand in 1921.

On 14 June 1922 he married Barbara McLaren (a daughter of Sir Herbert and Dame Agnes Jekyll, and the widow of the Honourable Francis McLaren) at St Martha on the Hill in Surrey. Barbara had two children from her previous marriage; she and Freyberg later had a son, Paul (1923–1993).

In the general election of 1922 he stood unsuccessfully (coming second) as a Liberal candidate for Cardiff South.




He represented New Zealand on the International Olympic Committee in 1928–30. Promoted to the permanent rank of major in 1927 (having been a substantive captain since 1916), he held a GSO2 staff appointment at Headquarters, Eastern Command until February 1929 when he was transferred to the Manchester Regiment and promoted to lieutenant-colonel upon being appointed to command the 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment.

In March 1931 he was promoted colonel (with seniority backdated to 1922) and was appointed Assistant Quartermaster General of Southern Command. In 1933 he wrote &quot;A Study of Unit Administration&quot;, which became a staff college textbook on quarter-masters&#x27; logistics; it went into a second edition in 1940.

In September 1933 he moved to a GSO1 posting at the War Office before being promoted major-general in July 1934. With this promotion, at age 45, he seemed headed for the highest echelons of the army. However, medical examinations prior to a posting in India revealed a heart problem. Despite strenuous efforts to surmount this, Freyberg, who was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1936, was obliged to retire on 16 October 1937.

==Second World War==
The British Army classified Freyberg as unfit for active service in 1937. After the outbreak of war in September 1939, he returned to its active list in December as a specially employed major-general. On being approached by the New Zealand Government, Freyberg, by then commanding the Salisbury Plain Area in the United Kingdom, offered his services and was appointed commander of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force and of the 2nd New Zealand Division.

Under Freyberg&#x27;s charter he was ultimately responsible only to the Government of New Zealand and as such was allowed to make decisions to protect the New Zealanders under his command. This enabled him to, at times, bypass his superior commanders and confer directly with Peter Fraser, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, on certain issues. He was also insistent that his division would fight as a complete formation and not be split up into brigade groups or smaller. This brought him into conflict with his senior commanders in the war&#x27;s early years, most notably with General Sir Archibald Wavell, then the Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East, where the division, which began to leave home in early 1940, began to concentrate.

In the chaos of the retreat from the Battle of Greece in 1941, Churchill gave Freyberg command of the Allied forces during the Battle of Crete. Although instructed to prevent an assault from the air, he remained obsessed with the possibility of a naval landing and based his tactics on it, neglecting adequately to defend the airfield at Maleme, ignoring ULTRA intelligence messages, which showed that the assault was coming by air. However, many sources consider that the intelligence given to Freyberg was vague and inadequate, and did indicate the possibility of a naval landing; this compromised his ability to respond correctly to the invasion.

Promoted to lieutenant-general in March 1942, and knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1942 New Year Honours, Freyberg continued to command the 2nd New Zealand Division through the North African and Italian campaigns as part of the British Eighth Army. He had an excellent reputation as a divisional-level tactician. Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, described Freyberg as his &quot;salamander&quot; due to his love of fire and wanting to be always in the middle of the action. An exploding German shell wounded Freyberg at the Battle of Mersa Matruh in June 1942 but he soon returned to the battlefield. Freyberg disagreed strongly with his superior, General Claude Auchinleck, the Eighth Army commander and insisted that as a commander of a national contingent he had the right to refuse orders if those orders ran counter to the New Zealand national interest. Freyberg enjoyed a good relationship with General Bernard Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander from August 1942, who thought highly of the experienced New Zealand commander.


In the climactic Second Battle of El Alamein (October–November 1942) the 2nd New Zealand Division played a vital part in the breakthrough by the Eighth Army; for his leadership, Freyberg was immediately promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. During the pursuit of the Axis forces to Tunisia, where they surrendered in May 1943, he led the New Zealanders on a series of well-executed left hooks to outflank Axis defence lines. In April and May 1943 Freyberg briefly commanded X Corps.

Freyberg was injured in an aircraft accident in September 1944. After six weeks in hospital he returned to command the New Zealand Division in its final operations, the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, which involved a series of river crossings and an advance of in three weeks. By the time of the German surrender, the New Zealanders had reached Trieste, having liberated both Padua and Venice, where there was a brief standoff with Yugoslav partisans. This success earned him a third bar to his DSO in July 1945 and he was made a Commander of the United States Legion of Merit.

Freyberg had excelled in planning set-piece attacks, such as at Operation Supercharge at Alamein, Operation Supercharge II at Tebaga Gap, and in the storming of the Senio line in 1945. The two occasions that Freyberg commanded at Corps level—at Crete and Monte Cassino—were less successful. Throughout the war he showed a disdain for danger. He showed notable concern for the welfare of his soldiers, taking a common-sense attitude to discipline and ensuring the establishment of social facilities for his men. He had become a very popular commander with the New Zealand troops, along with the people and government, by the time he left his command in 1945.

Freyberg is closely associated with the controversial decision to bomb the ancient monastery at Monte Cassino in February 1944. Freyberg, commanding the troops which fought what later became known as the Second and Third Battles of Monte Cassino, became convinced the abbey, founded in 529 AD, was being used as a military stronghold. The analysis of one of Freyberg&#x27;s divisional commanders, Major-General Francis Tuker of the 4th Indian Infantry Division, concluded in a memo to Freyberg that, regardless of whether the monastery was occupied by the Germans, it should be demolished to prevent its occupation. He pointed out that with -high walls made of masonry at least thick, it was impossible for engineers to break in and that bombing with &quot;blockbuster&quot; bombs would be the only solution since bombs would be &quot;next to useless&quot;. General Sir Harold Alexander, commander of the 15th Army Group (later the Allied Armies in Italy), agreed to the bombing (which did not employ blockbuster bombs). After the monastery&#x27;s destruction, the ruins were occupied by German forces, which held the position until 18 May. Following the war, the abbot of the monastery and other monks said that German troops had not occupied the inside of the abbey and it was not being used for military purposes.

In Trieste in May 1945, the occupation by Yugoslav forces was challenged by the 2nd New Zealand Division under Freyberg, and the city remained part of Italy. |

==Post-war==
Freyberg relinquished command of the New Zealand division, on 22 November 1945 having accepted an invitation to become Governor-General of New Zealand – the first with a New Zealand upbringing. He left London for his new post on 3 May 1946, after being made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. He retired from the army on 10 September 1946.

Freyberg served as Governor-General of New Zealand from 1946 until 1952. In this post he played a very active role, visiting all parts of New Zealand and its dependencies.

On Freyberg was appointed a Knight of the Order of Saint John; his wife, Barbara, was made a Dame of the order at the same time.

King George VI raised Freyberg to the peerage as Baron Freyberg, of Wellington in New Zealand and of Munstead in the County of Surrey, in 1951.

After his term as New Zealand governor-general had finished, Lord Freyberg returned to England, where he sat frequently in the House of Lords. On 1 March 1953 he became the Deputy Constable and Lieutenant-Governor of Windsor Castle; he took up residence in the Norman Gateway the following year.

Freyberg died at Windsor on 4 July 1963 following the rupture of one of his war wounds, and was buried in the churchyard of St Martha on the Hill near Guildford, Surrey. His wife is buried at his side, and their son, who had been awarded the MC, at the end of their graves.

==Tributes==
An athlete as well as a soldier, he is memorialised in the name of the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s headquarters, a stadium in Auckland and Wellington&#x27;s swimming pool on the site of his early victories. A number of streets are named after him including Freyberg Place in front of the Metropolis tower in central Auckland where there is a statue of him.

Auckland&#x27;s Freyberg Place (also known as Freyberg Square) was opened in 1946; Wellington&#x27;s Freyberg Pool in Oriental Bay opened in 1963; and Auckland&#x27;s Freyberg Field opened in 1965. The 15-storey Freyberg Building in Aitken Street, Thorndon, Wellington, was built in 1979. The adjacent Freyberg House built in about 2007 was demolished in 2018 after being damaged by the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake. Freyberg High School in Palmerston North opened in 1955.

The Sir Bernard Freyberg Cup is awarded to the winner in single sculls at the New Zealand Rowing Championship.

In November 2016 a blue plaque was unveiled at 8 Dynevor Road, Richmond, where he was born and a VC commemorative paving stone was unveiled to him outside Richmond Station by the Mayor of Richmond and the present Lord Freyberg.

<text>Oleg Grigoryevich Makarov (; 6 January 1933 28 May 2003) was a Soviet cosmonaut.

== Early life and education ==
Makarov was born in Udomlya, Tver Oblast, USSR. He graduated from Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School in 1957 and started working at the Special Design Bureau Number One (which is now RSC Energia) as an engineer, working on the Vostok spacecraft. In 1966, he was selected for cosmonaut training.

== Space program ==
He was originally part of the Soviet lunar program and was training with Alexei Leonov for the first human circumlunar flight. After the success of Apollo 8, however, the flight was cancelled.

His first spaceflight was Soyuz 12 in 1973, a test flight to check the changes made to the Soyuz spacecraft after the Soyuz 11 disaster. His second flight was the abortive Soyuz 18a that made an emergency landing in the Altay Mountains, 21 minutes after launch. With his third launch on Soyuz 27 he flew to space station Salyut 6 and landed five days later with the Soyuz 26 spacecraft. His last mission was Soyuz T-3, during which several repairs on Salyut 6 were done. He also served on the backup crews for Soyuz 17 and Soyuz T-2. Altogether he spent 20 days, 17 hours, and 44 minutes in space.

== Later life ==
After his final spaceflight he continued to work for Energia, both in the Mir space station program as well as the Energia-Buran development. He died in Moscow in 2003 from a heart attack.

== Awards ==
*Twice Hero of the Soviet Union (2 October 1973 and 16 March 1978)
*Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR (2 October 1973)
*Four Order of Lenin (2 October 1973, 21 April 1975, 16 March 1978, 10 December 1980)
*Order &quot;Blue Nile&quot; of Ethiopia (10 October 1981)
*Honorary Citizen of Baikonur, Dzhezkazgan, Kaluga, Karaganda, Rivne, and Yakutsk.

<doc id="241886" wikidata="Q426301" url="?curid=241886" title="Secant line">
<text>In geometry, a secant is a line that intersects a curve at a minimum of two distinct points.
The word &quot;secant&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;secare&quot;, meaning &quot;to cut&quot;. In the case of a circle, a secant intersects the circle at exactly two points. A chord is the line segment determined by the two points, that is, the interval on the secant whose ends are the two points.

==Circles==
A straight line can intersect a circle at zero, one, or two points. A line with intersections at two points is called a &quot;secant line&quot;, at one point a &quot;tangent line&quot; and at no points an &quot;exterior line&quot;. A &quot;chord&quot; is the line segment that joins two distinct points of a circle. A chord is therefore contained in a unique secant line and each secant line determines a unique chord.

In rigorous modern treatments of plane geometry, results that seem obvious and were assumed (without statement) by Euclid in his treatment, are usually proved.

For example, &quot;Theorem (Elementary Circular Continuity)&quot;: If formula_1 is a circle and formula_2 a line that contains a point that is inside formula_1 and a point that is outside of formula_1 then formula_2 is a secant line for formula_1.

In some situations phrasing results in terms of secant lines instead of chords can help to unify statements. As an example of this consider the result:
:If two secant lines contain chords and in a circle and intersect at a point that is not on the circle, then the line segment lengths satisfy .
If the point lies inside the circle this is Euclid III.35, but if the point is outside the circle the result is not contained in the Elements. However, Robert Simson following Christopher Clavius demonstrated this result, sometimes called the intersecting secants theorem, in their commentaries on Euclid.

==Curves==
For curves more complicated than simple circles, the possibility that a line that intersects a curve in more than two distinct points arises. Some authors define a secant line to a curve as a line that intersects the curve in two distinct points. This definition leaves open the possibility that the line may have other points of intersection with the curve. When phrased this way the definitions of a secant line for circles and curves are identical and the possibility of additional points of intersection just does not occur for a circle.

===Secants and tangents===
Secants may be used to approximate the tangent line to a curve, at some point , if it exists. Define a secant to a curve by two points, and , with fixed and variable. As approaches along the curve, if the slope of the secant approaches a limit value, then that limit defines the slope of the tangent line at . The secant lines are the approximations to the tangent line. In calculus, this idea is the geometric definition of the derivative.

A tangent line to a curve at a point may be a secant line to that curve if it intersects the curve in at least one point other than . Another way to look at this is to realize that being a tangent line at a point is a &quot;local&quot; property, depending only on the curve in the immediate neighborhood of , while being a secant line is a &quot;global&quot; property since the entire domain of the function producing the curve needs to be examined.

==Sets and -secants==
The concept of a secant line can be applied in a more general setting than Euclidean space. Let be a finite set of points in some geometric setting. A line will be called an -secant of if it contains exactly points of . For example, if is a set of 50 points arranged on a circle in the Euclidean plane, a line joining two of them would be a 2-secant (or &quot;bisecant&quot;) and a line passing through only one of them would be a 1-secant (or &quot;unisecant&quot;). A unisecant in this example need not be a tangent line to the circle.

This terminology is often used in incidence geometry and discrete geometry. For instance, the Sylvester–Gallai theorem of incidence geometry states that if points of Euclidean geometry are not collinear then there must exist a 2-secant of them. And the original orchard-planting problem of discrete geometry asks for a bound on the number of 3-secants of a finite set of points.

Finiteness of the set of points is not essential in this definition, as long as each line can intersect the set in only a finite number of points.

*Mean value theorem, that every secant of the graph of a smooth function has a parallel tangent line

<doc id="241894" wikidata="Q455551" url="?curid=241894" title="Sylvester McCoy">
<text>Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith (born 20 August 1943), known professionally as Sylvester McCoy, is a Scottish actor. Gaining prominence as a physical comedian, he became best known for playing the seventh incarnation of the Doctor in the long-running science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from 1987 to 1989—the final Doctor of the original run—and briefly returning in a television film in 1996. He is also known for his work as Radagast in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series (2012–2014).

==Early life==
McCoy was born Percy James Patrick Kent-Smith in Dunoon, on the Cowal peninsula, to an Irish Catholic mother and an English father who had died in action during World War II a couple of months before McCoy was born; he met his father&#x27;s family at the age of 17. His mother suffered a mental breakdown when McCoy was eight years old, and was institutionalised thereafter. Prior to adopting his stage name, McCoy was known as Kent Smith; he was unaware of his given names until he was eleven.

McCoy was raised primarily in Dunoon, where he attended Saint Mun&#x27;s School; he then studied for the priesthood at Blairs College, a seminary in Aberdeen between the ages of 12 and 16, but gave this up and continued his education at Dunoon Grammar School. After school he moved to London where he worked in the insurance industry for five years. He worked in the box office of The Roundhouse for a time, where he was discovered by Ken Campbell.

==Career==
===Early work===
McCoy came to prominence as a member of the experimental theatre troupe &quot;The Ken Campbell Roadshow&quot;. His best known act was as a stuntman character called &quot;Sylveste McCoy&quot; in a play entitled &quot;An Evening with Sylveste McCoy&quot; (the name was coined by actor Brian Murphy, who worked beside Kent-Smith at the Roundhouse Theatre and originated in the Wolfe Tones version of &quot;Big Strong Man&quot;), where his stunts included putting a fork and nails up his nose and stuffing ferrets down his trousers, and setting his head on fire. As a joke, the programme notes listed Sylveste McCoy as played by &quot;Sylveste McCoy&quot; and, conscious that he may have needed to distinguish himself from the American actor Kent Smith as his career progressed, Kent-Smith maintained the stage name. Canadian critic Milton Shulman believed McCoy&#x27;s name and fictionalised biography were genuine in his review of the Roadshow.

Notable television appearances before he gained the role of the Doctor included roles in &quot;Vision On&quot; (where he played Pepe/Epep, a character who lived in the mirror), an O-Man in &quot;Jigsaw&quot; and &quot;Tiswas&quot;. Every episode of the innovative ATV schools maths programme &quot;Leapfrog&quot; featured McCoy as &quot;Bert&quot; in wordless sequences filmed out of doors, as he attempted to form regular geometric patterns from different numbers of logs or carpet squares. He also appeared in &quot;Eureka&quot;, often suffering from the effects of inventions of Wilf Lunn, and as Wart, assistant to StarStrider in the Children&#x27;s ITV series of the same name. McCoy also portrayed, in one-man shows on the stage, two famous movie comedians: Stan Laurel and Buster Keaton. While playing Laurel, who had adopted his stage name due to the perceived bad luck of his real name containing thirteen letters, McCoy realised his stage name also had thirteen letters and added an &quot;r&quot; to the end of &quot;Sylveste&quot;. He also appeared as Henry &quot;Birdie&quot; Bowers in the 1985 television serial about Scott&#x27;s last Antarctic expedition, &quot;The Last Place on Earth&quot;.

McCoy also had a small role in the 1979 film &quot;Dracula&quot; opposite Laurence Olivier and Donald Pleasence, and has sung with the Welsh National Opera.
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===

McCoy became the Seventh Doctor after taking over the lead role in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1987 from Colin Baker. He remained on the series until it ended in 1989, ending with &quot;Survival&quot; (his twelfth and final serial as the Doctor). As Baker declined the invitation to film the regeneration scene, McCoy briefly wore a wig and appeared, face-down until the last moment before the regeneration commenced as the Sixth Doctor, with his face concealed by regeneration special effects. He played the Doctor in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, and again in 1996, appearing in the beginning of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie starring Paul McGann as the Eighth Doctor.

In his first season, McCoy used his background in physical comedy to portray the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but script editor Andrew Cartmel soon changed that when fans argued that the character (and plots) were becoming increasingly lightweight. The Seventh Doctor developed into a much darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game. A distinguishing feature of McCoy&#x27;s performances was his manner of speech. He used his natural Scottish accent and rolled his &quot;r&quot;s. At the start of his tenure he used proverbs and sayings adapted to his own ends (e.g. &quot;There&#x27;s many a slap twixt cup and lap&quot; – &quot;Delta and the Bannermen&quot;), although this characteristic was phased out during the later, darker series of his tenure. In 1990, readers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; voted McCoy&#x27;s Doctor &quot;Best Doctor&quot;, over perennial favourite Tom Baker. Since 1999 he has continued acting in the role of the Seventh Doctor in a series of audio plays for Big Finish Productions.

In November 2013 McCoy co-starred in the one-off 50th anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;.

In January 2021, McCoy returned to the role of the Doctor alongside Bonnie Langford as Mel Bush, in &quot;A Business Proposal for Mel!&quot; This short, acted as an announcement trailer for &#x27;The Collection: Season 24&#x27; Blu-Ray set, which was released later that year.

McCoy reprised the role of the Doctor in the 2022 special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot;, and again in the series &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;.

===Later work===
McCoy&#x27;s television roles since &quot;Doctor Who&quot; have included Michael Sams in the 1997 drama &quot;Beyond Fear&quot;, shown on the first night of broadcast of Channel 5. In 1988, while still appearing in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, McCoy presented a BBC children&#x27;s programme called &quot;What&#x27;s Your Story?&quot;, in which viewers were invited to phone in suggestions for the continuation of an ongoing drama.

He has also acted extensively in theatre in productions as diverse as pantomime and Molière. He played Grandpa Jock in John McGrath&#x27;s &quot;A Satire of the Four Estaites&quot; (1996) at the Edinburgh Festival. He played the role of Snuff in the macabre BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;The Cabaret of Dr Caligari&quot;.

McCoy missed out on a role in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; and was the second choice to play the role of Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. In 1991, he presented the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; video documentary release &quot;The Hartnell Years&quot; showcasing selected episodes of missing stories from the First Doctor&#x27;s era.

McCoy appeared as the lawyer Dowling in a BBC Production of Henry Fielding&#x27;s novel, &quot;The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling&quot;.
In 2001 he appeared in Paul Sellar&#x27;s asylum comedy &quot;The Dead Move Fast&quot; at the Gilded Balloon as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, playing the role of Doctor Mallinson. In 2012 he played the part of the suicidal Mr. Peters in JC Marshall&#x27;s play, &quot;Plume&quot;, at the Tron Theatre in Glasgow.

McCoy has appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company in &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; and in &quot;King Lear&quot; in 2007, playing the Fool to Ian McKellen&#x27;s Lear, a performance which made use of McCoy&#x27;s ability to play the spoons. The RSC production with McKellen and McCoy was staged in Melbourne, during late July/early August 2007 and Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, during mid to late August 2007. It came into residence at the New London Theatre in late 2007, ending its run in January 2008. He reprised the role for the 2008 television movie of the production.

In May 2008 he performed with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;, playing the title role. He only performed with the company briefly, for the week of the show&#x27;s run performing at the Sheffield Lyceum. Despite being set in Japan, he was able to demonstrate his ability to play the spoons by using his fan. In 2009 McCoy played the character of Mr. Mushnik in the Chocolate Factory&#x27;s production of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;.

He has also made guest appearances in the television series &quot;The Bill&quot;, the &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot; episode &quot;Father&quot; as Rab&#x27;s mentally ill brother Gash Sr. and the &quot;Still Game&quot; episode &quot;Oot&quot; (AKA &quot;Out&quot;), where he played a hermit-type character adjusting to life in modern Glasgow, having remained in his house for over 30 years. In October 2008, he had a minor guest role as an injured ventriloquist on &quot;Casualty&quot;. In the same month McCoy guest starred in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;, playing an actor who once played the time-travelling hero of a children&#x27;s television series called &quot;The Amazing Lollipop Man&quot;. The role was written as a tribute to McCoy.

In January and February 2016, McCoy appeared in the three-part BBC series &quot;The Real Marigold Hotel&quot;, which followed a group of celebrity senior citizens including Miriam Margolyes and Wayne Sleep on a journey to India.

In 2017 he returned to the stage at the Edinburgh Fringe, in the production &quot;A Joke&quot; alongside &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; actor Robert Picardo.

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot; trilogy===
McCoy began filming for &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a three-part adaptation of the book, in 2011. He portrays the wizard Radagast, alongside fellow &quot;King Lear&quot; actor Ian McKellen who reprises his role as Gandalf.

Although the character of Radagast is only alluded to in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and only a minor character in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the part was expanded for the films.

==Personal life==
McCoy and his wife, Agnes Verkaik, have two sons. They were filmed for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; playing Haemovores, but their scenes were deleted from the finished release. According to McCoy, his sons live in Holland and Thailand.

He was brought up a Catholic by his maternal grandmother and aunts but is now an atheist.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, McCoy spent some of lockdown living in France.

<doc id="241896" wikidata="Q892647" url="?curid=241896" title="Bonjour (software)">
<text>Bonjour is Apple&#x27;s implementation of zero-configuration networking (zeroconf), a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and hostname resolution. Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers, and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) service records.

The software comes built-in with Apple&#x27;s macOS and iOS operating systems. Bonjour can also be installed onto computers running Microsoft Windows. Bonjour components may also be included within other software such as iTunes and Safari.

It was originally introduced in 2002 with Mac OS X 10.2 with the name Rendezvous. It was renamed in 2005 to Bonjour following an out-of-court trademark dispute settlement.

==Overview==
Bonjour provides a general method to discover services on a local area network. The software is widely used throughout macOS, and allows users to set up a network without any configuration. it is used to find printers and file-sharing servers.

Notable applications using Bonjour include:

*iTunes to find shared music
*iPhoto to find shared photos
*Adium, Pidgin, Vine Server, and Elgato EyeTV to communicate with multiple clients
*SubEthaEdit to find document collaborators
*Solidworks and PhotoView 360 to manage licenses
*Things and OmniFocus to synchronize projects and tasks across the Mac desktop and the iPad, iPhone or iPod touch
*Safari to find local web servers and configuration pages for local devices

Software such as Bonjour Browser or iStumbler, both for macOS, can be used to view all services declared by these applications. Apple&#x27;s &quot;Remote&quot; application for iPhone and iPod Touch also uses Bonjour to establish connection to iTunes libraries via Wi-Fi.

Bonjour only works within a single broadcast domain, which is usually a small area, without special DNS configuration. macOS, Bonjour for Windows and AirPort Base Stations may be configured to use Wide Area Bonjour which allows for wide area service discovery via an appropriately configured DNS server.

Applications generally implement Bonjour services using standard TCP/IP calls, rather than in the operating system. Although macOS provides various Bonjour services, Bonjour also works on other operating systems. Apple has made the source code of the Bonjour multicast DNS responder, the core component of service discovery, available as a Darwin open source project. The project provides source code to build the responder daemon for a wide range of platforms, including Mac OS 9, macOS, Linux, *BSD, Solaris, VxWorks, and Windows. Apple also provides a user-installable set of services called Bonjour for Windows and Java libraries.

==Licensing==
Bonjour is released under a terms-of-limited-use license by Apple. It is freeware for clients, though developers and software companies who wish to redistribute it as part of a software package or use the Bonjour logo may need a licensing agreement. The source code for mDNSResponder is available under the Apache License.

==Naming==
Apple originally introduced the Bonjour software in August 2002 as part of Mac OS X 10.2 under the name &quot;Rendezvous&quot;. On August 27, 2003 Tibco Software Inc announced that it had filed a lawsuit for trademark infringement.
Tibco had an enterprise application integration product called TIBCO Rendezvous on the market since 1994 and stated that it had tried to come to an agreement with Apple Computer. In July 2004 Apple Computer and Tibco reached an out-of-court settlement; specifics of the settlement were not released to the public. On April 12, 2005, Apple announced the renaming of Rendezvous to &quot;Bonjour&quot;.

The current name &quot;Bonjour&quot; is French for the morning or afternoon greeting, &quot;good day&quot;. The previous name &quot;Rendezvous&quot; is French for &quot;meeting&quot;, &quot;appointment&quot; or &quot;date&quot;.

==Other implementations==
Bonjour version 2.0, released on February 24, 2010, works with Microsoft Windows 2000, 2003, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and 11. Systems use it primarily to facilitate the installation, configuration, and use of network printers, and thus it runs from startup. When Bonjour is fully implemented on Windows, some features—such as iChat—allow for communication between Windows and Mac OS. Bonjour for Windows also adds zeroconf capabilities to Internet Explorer, and provides a zeroconf implementation to Java VMs.

Some third-party applications, such as Adobe&#x27;s Photoshop CS3 suite,
also come bundled with Bonjour to take advantage of zeroconf technology.

Installers on Windows systems normally place Bonjour files in a folder called &quot;Bonjour&quot; within the &quot;Program Files&quot; folder. It modifies Windows system-registry entries related to internal network configuration and operation. Bonjour runs as mDNSResponder.exe. Communications across the network take place over UDP port 5353, which may require reconfiguring some personal or corporate firewalls that block Bonjour packets. A full installation of Bonjour for Windows will include a plug-in for Internet Explorer, a printer wizard, and the network communication services. Not all components are included when installed as part of a third-party application or as a component of other Apple software such as iTunes.

Some VPN clients are configured so that local network services are unavailable to a computer when VPN software is active and connected. In such a case no local zeroconf services are available to Bonjour or any other zeroconf implementation.

In September 2008, two security vulnerabilities were found in Bonjour for Windows.
Certain installations of Bonjour for Windows lack an uninstaller and do not display a human-readable entry in the Windows services listing.

In 32- and 64-bit releases of Windows 7, some older but still available versions of Bonjour services can disable all network connectivity by adding an entry of 0.0.0.0 as the default gateway. This was a bug reported in 2013.

The open-source IM clients Pidgin, Kopete and Adium support the Bonjour IM protocol, as does the closed-source Trillian client.

==Browsers==
A number of browsers allow an end-user to graphically explore the devices found using Bonjour.

=== Discovery / Bonjour Browser ===
Discovery is a Creative Commons-licensed macOS application that displays all services declared using Bonjour. The program was originally called Rendezvous Browser, but changed its name in version 1.5.4 after Apple changed the protocol&#x27;s name to Bonjour; since version 2.0, it has been renamed again, to Discovery. For certain protocols, double-clicking a list item will launch the associated helper. Version 1.5.6 was the first universal binary release.

Future versions will allow users to completely define a service, instead of relying on the author to do so.

Bonjour Browser was recommended for service discovery in &quot;MacAddict&quot; #123.

Discovery is available on the Apple App Store.

===JBonjourBrowser===
A student research project at Columbia University produced a Java-based system to match the functionality of Bonjour Browser, called JBonjourBrowser. JBonjourBrowser is open-source and available under the GPL.

JBonjourBrowser was built to emulate the functionality of Bonjour Browser, and at the same time work on multiple platforms. It requires Apple&#x27;s Bonjour Java library to run.

===Bonjour Browser for Windows===
A native Windows application offers similar functions to Bonjour Browser for Mac OS. Bonjour Browser for Windows is offered for free by Hobbyist Software and HandyDev Software.

===mDNSBrowser===
A commercial implementation called mDNSBrowser is offered by Netputing Systems Inc.

<doc id="241903" wikidata="Q2903732" url="?curid=241903" title="Vision On">
<text>Vision On was a British children&#x27;s television programme, shown on BBC1 from 1964 to 1976 and designed specifically for children with hearing impairment.

==Concept and production==
&quot;Vision On&quot; was conceived and developed by BBC producers Ursula Eason and Patrick Dowling to replace a monthly series &quot;For Deaf Children&quot; (1952–64), a programme paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles. It was noted in surveys that a favourite for deaf children was &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, due to its lively and fast-moving format and that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music&#x27;s lower frequency notes.

There was initial disagreement as to whether lip-reading or British Sign Language would be more appropriate. Eventually it was decided that, since the new programme was intended as entertainment rather than education, communication would be entirely visual, the amount of text would be severely limited and, except for a few repeated statements, speech would be abandoned altogether.
The title &quot;Vision On&quot; referred to the illuminated sign in studios indicating that cameras were live. Normally another sign &quot;Sound On&quot; would follow, but the titles for &quot;Vision On&quot; deliberately omitted this. The programme&#x27;s logo is made up from the handwritten words of the title and their reflection, stylised into an animated character.

The aim of the programme was to entertain but also to encourage imagination, with a fast-paced flow of contrasting ideas, both sane and silly. This mixture was an apparent success as the series ran for twelve years and, while retaining a commitment to the deaf, attracted a wider following and gained several awards including the international Prix Jeunesse and the BAFTA Award for Specialised Series (Patrick Dowling 1974).

==Presenters==
A full list of contributors can be found, but the main presenters were:

*Pat Keysell: an actress who also taught deaf children
*Tony Hart: artist, who made pictures in a variety of sizes and media, and encouraged children to submit their own paintings to &quot;The Gallery&quot;, which they did by the thousands
*Ben Benison and Sylvester McCoy (credited as Sylveste McCoy): mime artistes
*Wilf Lunn: eccentric inventor of equally eccentric machines
*David Cleveland: appeared in film sequences as the Prof

==Segments==
Besides the scenes with Hart, Keysell and the others doing artwork (which in later years appeared on the screen as the artwork being made without any hands), &quot;Vision On&quot; had many memorable segments:
*&quot;The Gallery&quot; – A section consisting of artwork sent into the show by viewers, with the name and age of the artist being shown alongside the artwork. Often the artwork shown on a specific show coincided with the theme of the show. At the end of this segment, Keysell would thank everyone for sending in their pictures and apologize for being unable to return them, but did state there was &quot;a prize for any that we show&quot;. However, it remains unknown as to what exactly the prize was.
*&quot;The Burbles&quot; – A couple of unseen people living inside a grandfather clock who converse in speech bubbles, mainly telling puns. Occasionally they are heard speaking the lines as if they are underwater, but other times there are just the speech bubbles. In the French version (Déclic), the characters are called Coin-Coin.
*&quot;The Prof&quot; – A man in a white lab coat (aka film-makers David Cleveland, Tony Amies and David Wyatt) who is usually outdoors doing various humorous things.
*&quot;Humphrey the Tortoise&quot; – Much like the Burbles, Humphrey talks of something specific (usually a pun or joke) either to himself or someone else. His speech, as well as the other person&#x27;s if there is one, is shown on screen with no audio.
*&quot;The Digger&quot; – A &quot;cut-out&quot; cartoon man created and animated by Bill Mather. Other Animators were Bob Baker, and Laurie Booth. Each week on a construction site he digs into the dirt with a shovel until something interesting is dug up.
*&quot;The Animated Clock&quot; – An animated cuckoo clock that is either showing signs of trouble or whose parts come to life like a human being, sometimes it would also feature a small animated man wandering around a surreal animated world and would interact with the clock&#x27;s bird.
*&quot;The Woofumpuss&quot; – One running gag in later episodes involved one of the cast members frantically chasing a fuzzy worm trying to catch it to no avail and occasionally messing up the artwork of Hart and Keysell.
*&quot;Aardman&quot; - Various Clay animated segments created by Peter Lord and David Sproxton, including the Greeblies, who served as early precursors of their later creation, Morph, and Aard-man, a superhero whose name would later become the name of Lord and Sproxton&#x27;s company, Aardman Animations.
*&quot;Dinosaur&quot; - Black &amp; white animated segments featuring a young dinosaur. Created by Arril Johnson. The final episode of &quot;Vision On&quot; ended with the Dinosaur on a hill, watching a full-colour sunset.

==Music==
Despite its intended hearing-impaired audience, the show made extensive use of music for the benefit of hearing viewers watching the show. Notable themes included:
* The opening theme was &quot;Accroche-Toi, Caroline&quot; by Caravelli (recorded by the Paris Studio Group).
* The closing theme was &quot;Java&quot; in the versions recorded by Al Hirt and Bert Kaempfert.
* &quot;The Gallery&quot; – &quot;Left Bank Two&quot; by Wayne Hill (recorded by The Noveltones) for De Wolfe Music is best remembered for this sequence. When &quot;Take Hart&quot; started, &quot;Left Bank Two&quot; became the opening theme tune and &quot;Cavatina&quot; became the &quot;Gallery&quot; music for the show instead.
* &quot;The Burbles&quot; theme &quot;Goofy&quot; by Cliff Johns.
* &quot;Humphrey the tortoise&quot; theme was &quot;Merry Ocarina&quot; by French composer Pierre Arvay (1924-1980).
* &quot;Animated Clock&quot; scenes used &quot;Gurney Slade&quot; by Max Harris (the theme music from the TV series &quot;The Strange World of Gurney Slade&quot;) and &quot;Keystone Capers&quot; by Eric Peters.
* &quot;The Digger&quot; music was &quot;Elephant Dance&quot; by Harry Pitch.
* &quot;The Prof&quot; – the two most commonly used themes were &quot;Comedy Cocktails 2&quot; and &quot;Comedy Cocktails 4&quot; by Paul Gerard, from the Chappell recorded music library.
* &quot;Interlude&quot; music was &quot;Rampage&quot; by Mike Vickers from the KPM music library. 
* Picture montages were often accompanied by &quot;Drumdramatics No.13&quot; by Robert Farnon, from the Chappell Music library.

==Co-productions==
&quot;Vision On&quot; was co-produced in France with ORTF, in Canada with Radio-Canada under the title &quot;Déclic&quot; and in Sweden as &quot;Ögon Blik&quot;. It was also shown in Israel under the title &quot;קסים קסם&quot; (Magic Magic).

==Distribution==
The programme was shown in many other countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden &amp; Switzerland.

In the United States, many PBS stations, and a few commercial stations, aired &quot;Vision On&quot; during the 1970s and 1980s. Some of these stations, such as KOMO-TV in Seattle, taped their own episodes, which were seen along with the BBC-produced shows.

==End of production==
Series&#x27; producer Dowling eventually found that the flow of new ideas became more and more difficult to sustain, and after twelve years decided to close the programme while it was still at its height.

Dowling and Hart continued to make arts programmes, starting with &quot;Take Hart&quot; (which kept &quot;The Gallery&quot; segment), continuing with &quot;Hartbeat&quot; between 1984 and 1993, and &quot;SMart&quot; from 1994 until 2009.

<text>Peng Dehuai (October 24, 1898November 29, 1974) was a Chinese general and politician who was the Minister of National Defense from 1954 to 1959. Peng was born into a poor peasant family, and received several years of primary education before his family&#x27;s poverty forced him to suspend his education at the age of ten, and to work for several years as a manual laborer. When he was sixteen, Peng became a professional soldier. Over the next ten years Peng served in the armies of several Hunan-based warlord armies, raising himself from the rank of private second class to major. In 1926, Peng&#x27;s forces joined the Kuomintang, and Peng was first introduced to communism. Peng participated in the Northern Expedition, and supported Wang Jingwei&#x27;s attempt to form a left-leaning Kuomintang government based in Wuhan. After Wang was defeated, Peng briefly rejoined Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s forces before joining the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), allying himself with Mao Zedong and Zhu De.

Peng was one of the most senior generals who defended the Jiangxi Soviet from Chiang&#x27;s attempts to capture it, and his successes were rivaled only by Lin Biao. Peng participated in the Long March, and supported Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference, which was critical to Mao&#x27;s rise to power. During the 1937–1945 Second Sino-Japanese War, Peng was one of the strongest supporters of pursuing a ceasefire with the Kuomintang in order to concentrate China&#x27;s collective resources on resisting the Japanese Empire. Peng was the senior commander in the combined Kuomintang–Communist efforts to resist the Japanese occupation of Shanxi in 1937; and, by 1938, was in command of two-thirds of the Eighth Route Army. In 1940, Peng conducted the Hundred Regiments Offensive, a massive Communist effort to disrupt Japanese logistical networks across northern China. The Hundred Regiments Offensive was modestly successful, but political disputes within the Communist Party led to Peng being recalled to Yan&#x27;an, and he spent the rest of the war without an active command. After the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, Peng was given command of Communist forces in Northwest China. He was the most senior commander responsible for defending the Communist leadership in Shaanxi from Kuomintang forces, saving Mao from being captured at least once. Peng eventually defeated the Kuomintang in Northwest China, captured huge amounts of military supplies, and actively incorporated the huge area, including Xinjiang, into the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Peng was one of the few senior military leaders who supported Mao&#x27;s suggestions to involve China directly in the 1950–1953 Korean War, and he served as the direct commander of the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army for the first half of the war (though Mao and Zhou Enlai were technically more senior). Peng&#x27;s experiences in the Korean War convinced him that the Chinese military had to become more professional, organized, and well-equipped in order to prepare itself for the conditions of modern technical warfare. Because the Soviet Union was the only communist country then equipped with a fully modern, professional army, Peng attempted to reform China&#x27;s military on the Soviet model over the next several years, making the army less political and more professional (contrary to the political goals of Mao). Peng resisted Mao&#x27;s attempts to develop a personality cult throughout the 1950s; and, when Mao&#x27;s economic policies associated with the Great Leap Forward caused a nationwide famine, Peng became critical of Mao&#x27;s leadership. The rivalry between Peng and Mao culminated in an open confrontation between the two at the 1959 Lushan Conference. Mao won this confrontation, labeled Peng as a leader of an &quot;anti-Party clique&quot;, and purged Peng from all influential positions for the rest of his life.

Peng lived in virtual obscurity until 1965, when the reformers Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping supported Peng&#x27;s limited return to government, developing military industries in Southwest China. In 1966, following the advent of the Cultural Revolution, Peng was arrested by Red Guards. From 1966 to 1970, radical factions within the CCP, led by Lin Biao and Mao&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing, singled out Peng for national persecution, and Peng was publicly humiliated in numerous large-scale struggle sessions and subjected to physical and psychological torture in organized efforts to force Peng to confess his &quot;crimes&quot; against Mao Zedong and the CCP. In 1970, Peng was formally tried and sentenced to life imprisonment, and he died in prison in 1974. After Mao died in 1976, Peng&#x27;s old ally, Deng Xiaoping, emerged as China&#x27;s paramount leader. Deng led an effort to formally rehabilitate people who he believed to have been unjustly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and Peng was one of the first leaders to be posthumously rehabilitated, in 1978. In modern China, Peng is considered one of the most successful and highly respected generals in the history of the CCP.

== Early life ==
Peng was born on October 24, 1898, in the village of Shixiang, Xiangtan County, Hunan. His birth name was &quot;Peng Dehua&quot;. Peng&#x27;s family lived in a thatched-straw hut and owned approximately 1.5 acres of irrigated land on which the family grew bamboo, sweet potatoes, tea, cotton, and various vegetables. His father also operated a bean curd shop. The income from the land and shop supported an extended family of eight people, including Peng, his three brothers, his parents, his grandmother, and a grand-uncle. Peng&#x27;s grand-uncle had joined and fought for the Taiping rebellion and used to tell Peng about the old Taiping ideals: everyone should have enough food to eat, women should not bind their feet, and land should be redistributed equally. Peng later described his own class background as &quot;lower-middle peasant.&quot;

From 1905 to 1907, Peng was enrolled in a traditional Confucian primary school. In 1908, Peng attended a modern primary school but at the age of ten was forced to withdraw from this school because of his family&#x27;s deteriorating financial situation. In 1905 to 1906, there was a severe drought in Hunan. Peng&#x27;s mother died in 1905, and Peng&#x27;s six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng&#x27;s father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food and to pawn most of his family&#x27;s land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908 to 1910, Peng took work on looking after a pair of water buffaloes.

When Peng&#x27;s grand-uncle died in 1911, Peng left home and worked at a coalmine in Xiangtan, where he pushed carts of coal for a wage of nine yuan a month. In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, which cheated Peng out of half his annual wages. Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913, Hunan suffered another drought and famine, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant&#x27;s storehouse and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng&#x27;s arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer for the construction of a dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home and joined the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.

== Early military service ==

=== Service in warlord armies ===

At the time, the minimum age of enlistment in Hunan was 18. Peng was able to join in March 1916 at the age of 17 as a private second class soldier. This may be why his year of birth is sometimes given as 1897 not 1898. Peng received a monthly wage, a portion of which he would continuously send back to support his family. Within seven months, he was promoted to private first class. One of Peng&#x27;s commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution and influenced Peng to sympathize with the Kuomintang&#x27;s goals of social reform and national reunification. After another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng&#x27;s regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade and education in written classical Chinese. In July 1918, Peng was captured on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but he was released after two weeks. In April 1919, Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi&#x27;s forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920 and captured the provincial capital of Changsha.

Peng participated in a failed mutiny over pay but was ultimately pardoned along with other rebels, because there was a shortage of soldiers at the time. In August 1921, Peng was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant and became acting company commander several weeks later. Stationed in a village in Nanxian, Peng noticed that the poor were being mistreated by a local landlord, and he encouraged them to establish an &quot;association to help the poor.&quot; When the local villagers hesitated, Peng ordered his soldiers to arrest the landlord and execute him. Peng was reprimanded for his actions but not demoted or reassigned. After that incident, Peng began to consider seriously leaving the service of his provincial warlord army. In February 1922, after applying for extended unpaid leave, Peng and several other officers traveled to Guangdong to seek employment in the army of the Kuomintang.

Peng&#x27;s impression of the Kuomintang in 1922 was not favorable, and he left Guangzhou with the intention of settling back in Hunan as a farmer. Peng returned to his home village by sea via Shanghai, the farthest that he had ever been from his home village, and farmed with his father for three months on land that his father had bought with money sent home by Peng, but Peng did not find that occupation to be satisfying.

After one of Peng&#x27;s old comrades had suggested that Peng apply to the local Hunan Military Academy to seek employment as a formally-trained professional officer, Peng accepted. Peng successfully gained admission in August 1922 and used the personal name &quot;Dehuai&quot; for the first time. In August 1923, after nine months of training, Peng graduated from the academy and rejoined his old regiment with the rank of captain. He was promoted to acting battalion commander in April 1924.

In 1924, Tang&#x27;s army aligned with northern warlords against the Guangdong warlord allied with the Kuomintang. Nonetheless, Peng reorganized his battalion along pro-Kuomintang political lines in 1925. In late 1925, Chiang Kai-shek established the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) and led the Kuomintang to take control of Guangdong. Tang then realigned himself with Chiang in 1926. After Wu Peifu drove Tang out of Changsha, Chiang ordered the NRA to relieve Tang and began the Northern Expedition, an effort to unify China by defeating the northern warlords. Tang&#x27;s forces were incorporated into the NRA, and Peng was promoted to the rank of major. Peng himself did not become a formal member of the Kuomintang. He first heard of the CCP in 1925.

=== Kuomintang officer ===
Between July 1926 and March 1927, Peng campaigned in Hunan, participating in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under General He Jian, Peng participated in the battle of Fengtai, in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan, causing a split with the center/right-leaning government in Nanking. Tang Shengzhi aligned himself with the Wuhan government, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. However, Tang&#x27;s forces were defeated by Chiang. During their retreat in 1928, He Jian, under whom Peng served, defected to the Nanking side. Peng became a full colonel after the reorganization.

In 1927, Peng was approached several times by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members, including some of his old friends. The communists&#x27; persistent push for land redistribution resonated with his childhood experience of poverty. Peng was also disappointed by the left-right split within the Kuomintang and the in-fighting among Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s own forces. In October, Peng was approached by Duan Dechang, a CCP representative, but Peng could not make up his mind at the time. He met with Duan again later that month, however, and began studying basic communist theory. Albeit secretly, Peng became a member of the CCP no later than April 1928.

After his superior officer He Jian defected to Chiang&#x27;s forces, Peng was stationed in the mountainous Pingjiang County, northwest of Changsha, in May 1928. His orders were to eliminate local groups of communist guerrillas who had fled to the area after the Shanghai massacre of 1927. Peng kept his unit passive and began organizing local party branches with other secret members of the CCP within his own troops. His forces then executed the county magistrate and landlords, formed a local soviet, and incorporated themselves within the Chinese Red Army. Following a prolonged defeat at the hands of He Jian, who still served the KMT, Peng retreated to Jinggangshan to join Mao Zedong and Zhu De.

Political scientist Jürgen Domes wrote that like many other young men at the time, Peng&#x27;s social consciousness was awakened by their experience of impoverishment and sharpened by the disappointment they felt with the Kuomintang (KMT) for not completely following through with its revolution after the Qing dynasty was overthrown. Communist-leaning cadres of the Kuomintang were some of the most ardent advocates of the KMT party platform, which had called for national sovereignty, eradication of warlordism, a welfare state, and equal distribution of land. After Chiang split with Wang and re-ingratiated himself with the warlords, Peng and others felt that the CCP was the only major force that represented what they had been fighting for. More advanced communist doctrines and ideological considerations do not appear to have played a significant role.

== Red Army commander ==
=== Defending the Jiangxi Soviet ===
Following his defeat by He Jian, Peng and the remnant of his forces joined the communist guerrillas at Jinggangshan. One of his first operations was to save Mao, who was attached to a unit that faced encirclement from Kuomintang forces. Jinggangshan was very poor and cold during the winter. It was ideal for retreat but not as a base for the growing communist forces. Zhu and Mao decided to attack into the adjacent area around Ruijin, Jiangxi, an agricultural city defended by weak warlord units. In January 1929, they successfully occupied the area, which became the Jiangxi Soviet.

Peng remained behind to guard Jinggangshan with a force of 800 soldiers but withdrew after an attack by a Hunanese Kuomintang force of 25,000 soldiers. He was criticized by Mao for retreating. Peng returned to the area with a force of 1,000 men later that year after the Kuomintang withdrew. He then successfully organized two large raids into southern Hunan, first during the summer of 1929 and later in the spring of 1930, increasing the amount of supplies and the number recruits for his force. Between those two raids, a compromise was reached within the broader communist forces at large. Professional military discipline and strategy should prevail over Mao&#x27;s mobile guerilla tactics, while political indoctrination efforts by CCP commissars, such as Mao, would be strengthened.

In April 1930, Peng became the commander of a newly formed Red 3rd Army. In July 1930, Li Lisan, who had gained &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, saw the worldwide economic depression as a window of opportunity and issued a general order for communist units around China to &quot;conquer one provincial capital&quot; as a signal of a nationwide uprising and &quot;revolutionary storm.&quot; Mao and Zhu were skeptical, but Peng prepared for and launched attacks on the cities of Yuezhou and Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, with 17,000 soldiers and the support of another 10,000 guerillas. Changsha was defended by He Jian, Peng&#x27;s former superior. Peng was initially victorious and occupied the city on July 30 following a hasty retreat by He. The anticipated nationwide revolution did not occur, however, and on August 5 He Jian counterattacked with a force of 35,000 men. Peng was forced to withdraw. On September 1, Peng attempted to capture Changsha again but suffered heavy casualties. Mao and Zhu had been reluctant to fully support Peng during his campaign. Nonetheless, Zhu was willing to explore other vectors of attack with Peng. Mao, however, believed that they should continue to consolidate their base areas instead. Under the influence of Li Lisan, some CCP members in Jiangxi rose up to oppose Mao&#x27;s strategy, but the insurgency was suppressed in early 1931.

Peng scored a series of victories defending against the Kuomintang-aligned National Revolutionary Army (NRA) during the first three encirclement campaigns from December 1930 to May 1931. The outcome bolstered the positions of Zhu and Peng, who conducted conventional mobile operations in contrast with Mao&#x27;s doctrine of guerilla warfare. After Li Lisan fell from power, &quot;internationalists&quot; who were more aligned with the Comintern rose to prominence within the Party. Following the return of several military leaders who had been training in Moscow, Jiangxi Soviet&#x27;s forces were re-organized along more professional lines as Peng had long advocated for. On November 7, Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet, the first time that he had been named to a position of political leadership in the communist movement. In February 1932, Peng attacked but failed to dislodge elite NRA troops at Kanchow. Nonetheless, he continued to argue in favor of conventional operations over guerilla tactics during the August meeting of the Party&#x27;s Military Commission, where he was named vice-chairman. During the fourth encirclement campaign involving 400,000 NRA soldiers, Peng successfully defeated an elite enemy division in Chiaohu and forayed into Fujian province, capturing a large amount of ammunition. In 1933, the Chinese Communist Party shifted its focus from underground activities in the cities to building up its power in rural bases.

=== Long March ===
In October 1933 Chiang Kai-shek took command of nearly 800,000 soldiers and led the fifth encirclement campaign against CCP forces, which numbered about 150,000 regulars and guerillas. The communist military leaders, including Peng and Zhu De, prepared largely static defenses, a strategy supported by the internationalists, the returned &quot;students&quot;, and German advisor Otto Braun. Chiang was able to successfully encircle the soviet base areas and deal a number of defeats to the communists. Peng&#x27;s own units shrank from 35,000 to around 20,000 men. CCP remnants decided to retreat from Jiangxi. On October 20, 1934, they broke out of NRA encirclement and began the Long March. Of the 18,000 men under Peng&#x27;s command when the March began, only about 3,000 remained when Peng&#x27;s forces reached their eventual destination in Shaanxi on October 20, 1935.

Due to their defeat in 1934, Peng began shifting toward the doctrine of guerilla warfare advocated by Mao. He supported Mao&#x27;s rise to power during the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. Peng continued to consolidate the communists&#x27; base area after arriving in Shaanxi by campaigning in neighboring Shanxi and Gansu. In April 1937, Peng was named vice commander-in-chief of all Chinese communist forces, outranked only by Zhu De, who was named commander-in-chief. Peng&#x27;s promotion was supported by Lin Biao, who had been actively supporting Peng for promotions to senior leadership as early as May 1934. In early 1935, Lin responded to widespread discontent within the Red Army over Mao&#x27;s evasive tactics, which it perceived as unnecessarily exhausting, by publicly proposing for Peng to take overall command of the Red Army, but Mao, who had recently been promoted to the position, attacked Peng and Lin for challenging him and successfully retained his position.

In October 1935, following the last major battle between the Kuomintang and the Red Army, Mao wrote and dedicated a poem to Peng. (The poem was not published until 1947.)

: The mountains are high, the road is long and full of potholes,
: Many soldiers are moving to and fro,
: Who is the courageous one, striking from his horse in all directions?
: None other than our great General Peng!

In 1936, the American journalist Edgar Snow stayed for several days at Peng&#x27;s compound in Yuwang while Peng was campaigning in Ningxia. Snow had long conversations with him and wrote two whole chapters about Peng in his book &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;. He wrote more about Peng than any other individual, except for Mao.

== World War II ==
After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan went to war. When the Kuomintang and communists declared a united front to fight the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Luochuan Conference (), Mao believed that the united front should be used as a feint by giving token resistance to the Japanese but saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang. However, Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders, disagreed and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists co-operated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.

When the Japanese invaded Shanxi, the Red Army (renamed the Eighth Route Army) assisted the Kuomintang warlord, Yan Xishan, in resisting the Japanese, and Peng traveled to the provincial capital, Taiyuan, with Zhou Enlai to co-ordinate tactics. After the Japanese advanced towards Taiyuan on September 13, 1937, Peng directed overall operations from a base in Wutaishan but was called from duty to attend a Politburo meeting on December 13. At the meeting, Peng advocated a greater material commitment to the defense of Shanxi, but Mao disagreed and wanted the Red Army to reduce its commitment to fighting the Japanese. In 1938, after Mao&#x27;s rival, Zhang Guotao, defected to the Kuomintang, Peng moved closer to Mao&#x27;s position. In late 1938, Peng set up a base in Taihangshan, on the borders of Shanxi and Hebei, and directed guerrilla operations in both provinces. From Taihangshan, Peng commanded two thirds of the Eighth Route Army, approximately 100,000 soldiers.

In July 1940, Peng was given overall command of the largest communist operation of the anti-Japanese war, the Hundred Regiments Offensive, when 200,000 regular troops from the Eighth Route Army participated in the operation and were supported by 200,000 irregular communist guerrillas. From August 20 to October 5, 1940, communist forces destroyed large numbers of bridges, tunnels, and railroad tracks in Japanese-occupied China and inflicted relatively heavy Japanese casualties. From October 6 to December 5, the Japanese counterattacked, and the communists mostly repelled the counterattack successfully. Peng&#x27;s operation was successful in disrupting Japanese communication lines and logistics networks, which were not fully restored until 1942, but the communists suffered heavy losses, In communist sources, the Japanese casualties have two figures, one of which is 20,645 and the other 12,645. Foreign sources give figures of 20,900. In early 1941, the Japanese began a large-scale effort to drive Peng from his base in Taihangshan, and Peng relocated closer to the communist base in Yan&#x27;an in late 1941.

After being recalled to Yan&#x27;an, Peng was subjected to a political indoctrination campaign in which he was criticized as an &quot;empiricist&quot; for his good relations with the Comintern and survived professionally only through an unconditional conversion to Mao&#x27;s leadership. Mao ordered Peng to be criticized for 40 days for the &quot;failings&quot; of the Hundred Regiments Campaign (even though Mao had supported it and later praised its successes). Peng was not allowed to reply and was forced to make a self-criticism. Privately, Peng resented Mao&#x27;s criticism of him, and in 1959 once told Mao: &quot;At Yan&#x27;an, you fucked my mother for forty days.&quot;

From 1942 to 1945, Peng&#x27;s role in the war was mostly political, and he supported Mao very closely. In June 1944, Peng was part of a team that held conferences with American military personnel who visited Yan&#x27;an as part of the Dixie Mission, briefing the Americans about the military situation in Japanese-occupied China.

== People&#x27;s Liberation Army ==

===Defeating the Kuomintang===
The Japanese surrendered on September 2, 1945, ending China&#x27;s war with Japan and beginning the final stage of the Chinese Civil War. In October Peng took command of troops in northern China, occupied Inner Mongolia, and accepted the surrender of Japanese soldiers there. In March 1946, communist forces (1.1 million soldiers) were renamed the &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot; (PLA). Peng himself was placed in command of 175,000 soldiers, organized as the &quot;Northwest Field Army,&quot; most of which had been under the command of He Long during the war against Japan. He then became Peng&#x27;s second-in-command. Peng&#x27;s notable subordinates in the Northwest Field Army included Zhang Zongxun and Wang Zhen.

Peng&#x27;s forces were the most poorly armed of the newly re-organized army but were responsible for the area around the communist capital, Yan&#x27;an. In March 1947, Kuomintang General Hu Zongnan, invaded the area with 260,000 soldiers. Hu&#x27;s forces were among the best-trained and most well-supplied Nationalist units, but one of Zhou Enlai&#x27;s spies was able to provide Peng with information about Hu&#x27;s strategic plans, his forces&#x27; troop distributions, strength, and positions, and details about the air cover available to Hu. Peng was forced to abandon Yan&#x27;an in late March but resisted Hu&#x27;s forces long enough for Mao and other senior party leaders to evacuate safely. Mao wanted Peng to provoke a decisive confrontation with Hu immediately, but Peng dissuaded him. By April, Mao agreed that Peng&#x27;s objective was to &quot;keep the enemy on the run... tire him out completely, reduce his food supplies, and then look for an opportunity to destroy him.&quot;

On May 4 Peng&#x27;s forces attacked an isolated supply depot in northeastern Shaanxi, arrested its commander, and captured food reserves, 40,000 army uniforms, and a collection of arms that included over a million pieces of artillery. Peng&#x27;s forces were pushed back to the border of Inner Mongolia but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu&#x27;s forces in August, in the Battle of Shajiadian(沙家店战役), which saved Mao and other members from the Central Committee from being taken prisoner. Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang forces out of northern Shaanxi in April 1948.

Between 1947 and September 22, 1949, Peng&#x27;s forces occupied Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. His forces repeatedly defeated but could not destroy the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng&#x27;s forces, led directly by Wang Zhen, invaded Xinjiang. Most of Xinjiang&#x27;s defenders surrendered peacefully and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng&#x27;s army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang, with Wang Zhen as his deputy. That appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an area of over 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles) but under 30 million people. Peng&#x27;s forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang, which they completed in September 1951.

=== Korean War ===
North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. After receiving its endorsement from the United Nations, the United States landed its first troops in Korea on September 15. On October 1, the first anniversary of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic, UN forces crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. There was some disagreement within China&#x27;s leadership about how to react to the American push to the Chinese border. Mao and Zhou wanted direct military intervention, but most other Chinese leaders believed that China should not enter the war unless it was directly attacked. Lin Biao was Mao&#x27;s first choice to lead the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) into Korea, but Lin refused, citing his bad health.

Mao then sought the support of Peng, who had not yet taken a strong position, to lead the PVA. Peng flew to Beijing from Xi&#x27;an (where he was still administering northwest China and directing the incorporation of Xinjiang into the PRC), and arrived on October 4. Peng listened to both sides of the debate and on October 5 decided to support Mao. Peng&#x27;s support for Mao&#x27;s position changed the atmosphere of the meeting, and most other leaders changed their positions to support a direct Chinese intervention in the Korean War. On October 5, Peng was named the Commander and the Commissar of the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army and held both titles until the in 1953. Mao directed China&#x27;s general strategy, and Zhou was appointed general commander and coordinating Peng&#x27;s forces with the Soviet and North Korean governments and the rest of the Chinese government. Over the next week, Peng established a headquarters in Shenyang, and prepared his invasion strategy with his officers. 

Peng stripped Kim Il-sung of his military command, condemning Kim&#x27;s leadership as &quot;extremely childish&quot; and incompetent, effectively reducing Kim to a powerless figure in the war.
After Zhou and Lin had negotiated Stalin&#x27;s approval, Peng attended a conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered the first wave of Chinese soldiers, in total more than 260,000 men, to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25, the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the 38th parallel. However, on his watch, Mao&#x27;s son Anying was killed in an air raid. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel to fulfill Mao&#x27;s political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951, as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 to June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just north the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of US Army&#x27;s official Korean War historian Roy Edgar Appleman, Peng&#x27;s performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng&#x27;s successful campaigns, from October to December 1950, were fought under Mao&#x27;s direction but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January to May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao&#x27;s instructions. Modern scholars reject that interpretation and credit Peng with both the successes and the failures of the war.

PVA casualties during the first 12 months of the Korean War, from October 1950 to October 1951, were heavy. Soviet material support was slight, and because the only available means to transport supplies into Korea for the first year of the war was a force of 700,000 labourers, all available supplies were light and limited. The UN forces also had complete air superiority. The logistic constraints later caused 45,000 Chinese soldiers to freeze to death between November 27 and December 12, 1950, because of inadequate winter clothing. China&#x27;s insufficient artillery, armor, and air support meant that Peng was forced to rely heavily on human wave tactics until the summer of 1951. Stealthy fireteams attacked in column against weak points in enemy defenses in the hope that surprise, attrition, and perseverance would break the enemy lines. Participants even drank large quantities of Kaoliang wine to improve their courage. Some of the worst Chinese battle losses occurred during the Second and the Fifth Phase Campaign. Up to 40% of all Chinese forces in Korea were rendered combat ineffective between November 25 and December 24, 1950, and about 12 Chinese divisions were lost in from April 22 to June 10, 1951. All in all, over a million Chinese soldiers became casualties during the course of the war. Peng justified the PVA&#x27;s high casualty rate by his almost religious belief in communism and the party and his belief that the ends of the conflict justified the means. Some accounts even claimed that Peng invented the human wave tactic under the name &quot;short attack&quot; to exploit his manpower advantage.

On November 19, 1951, Zhou called a conference in Shenyang to discuss improvements to China&#x27;s logistical network, but they did little to resolve China&#x27;s supply problems directly. Peng visited Beijing several times over the next several months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951–1952, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted and that neither side would be able for achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA&#x27;s logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted, &quot;You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. We have only a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can&#x27;t you overcome some of your difficulties?&quot; The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. He later called a series of meetings, and it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups to be dispatched to Korea in shifts, to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots, to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines, to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union, to provide the army with more food and clothing, and to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign because of his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA&#x27;s hardship.
Truce talks began on July 10, 1951, but proceeded slowly. Peng was recalled to China in April 1952 for a head tumor, and Chen Geng and Deng Hua later assumed Peng&#x27;s responsibilities in the PVA.

On July 27, 1953, Peng personally signed the armistice agreement in Panmunjom. At a mass rally in Pyongyang on July 31, Kim Il Sung awarded Peng his second North Korean &quot;National Flag&quot; Order of Merit, First Class (the first had been awarded to Peng in 1951) and awarded Peng the title of &quot;Hero of the Korean Democratic People&#x27;s Republic.&quot; Peng also received a hero&#x27;s welcome in Tiananmen Square on August 11. Chinese troops remained in North Korea until 1958.

The Korean War affected Peng&#x27;s vision for the development of the PLA over the next decade. The heavy losses in the war&#x27;s first year indicated unpreparedness for modern conventional warfare; the PLA needed modern professional standards, equipment, and tactics. Military training needed to take priority over political indoctrination, and commissars should be subordinate to military commanders. He regarded the Soviet Army — the only example of a modern communist force — as the model. Peng believed that the CCP&#x27;s main role was to improve the welfare of the common people; this was contrary to Mao&#x27;s political goals and contributed to their conflict in the late 1950s. Stalin once arbitrated in favor of Peng in a conflict with a Soviet diplomat by saying, &quot;Trust him in everything; Peng is a long-tested, talented militarist.&quot;

== Defense Minister ==
After being recalled to China in April 1952, Peng succeeded Zhou in managing the day-to-day affairs of the Central Military Commission in July 1952. In the spring of 1954, Peng was confirmed as the vice-chairman of the commission (Mao was its chairman) and became effectively the most senior military leader in China. On September 24, 1954, the First National People&#x27;s Congress confirmed Peng&#x27;s position and appointed him Defense Minister and one of the ten vice-ministers of the State Council. Lin Biao was senior to Peng on the State Council. Soon after accepting those appointments, on October 1, 1954, Peng produced an ambitious plan for the modernization of the PLA on the model of the Soviet military.

=== Political activities ===
Peng had been an alternate member of the Central Committee since 1934, a full member since 1938, and a member of the Politburo since 1945, but it was not until he became the leader of the PLA and moved permanently to Beijing in November 1953 that he could attend regular political meetings and became active in domestic politics. Peng had been loyal to Mao&#x27;s leadership since the 1935 Zunyi Conference and continued to support Mao for several years after he had moved to Beijing. Peng, like Lin Biao, was implicated in passively supporting Gao Gang&#x27;s effort to replace Liu Shaoqi as the second most powerful person in China in 1953 but then opposed Gao in 1954 once Mao had made his own opposition clear. Mao did not take any action against Peng or Lin, but Peng&#x27;s involvement alienated Peng from Liu and Liu&#x27;s supporters.

In 1955, Peng supported Mao&#x27;s efforts to collectivize agriculture. Along with Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Lin Biao, Lin Boqu, and Luo Ronghuan, Peng opposed Mao&#x27;s attempt to liberalize China&#x27;s culture and politics in the first stages of the 1957 Hundred Flowers Campaign but then supported Mao&#x27;s efforts to arrest and persecute Chinese citizens who had criticized the CCP later that year.

During the late 1950s, Peng developed a personal dislike for Mao&#x27;s efforts to promote his own image in Chinese popular culture as a perfect hero singularly responsible for the communist victories of his time. In 1955 to 1956, Peng was involved in a large number of efforts to moderate Mao&#x27;s popular image by developing it into a personal campaign. Peng&#x27;s preference for modesty and simplicity led Peng to oppose Mao&#x27;s efforts to develop his personality cult. In 1955, a draft copy of a book, &quot;The Military History of the PVA&quot;, was submitted to Peng so that he could edit and authorize it. The preface of the book stated that &quot;the military victories of the PVA&quot; were won &quot;under the correct leadership of the CCP and of Comrade Mao Zedong.&quot; Peng authorized the text after he had removed &quot;and of Comrade Mao Zedong.&quot; In 1956, an anonymous Chinese citizen wrote a letter to Peng to condemn the practices of hanging portraits of Mao in public places and singing songs in praise of Mao. Peng sent this letter to Huang Kecheng, his chief of staff, to be widely distributed. Peng successfully opposed efforts to place a bronze statue of Mao in the Beijing Military Museum by saying, &quot;Why take the trouble to put it up? What is put up now will be removed in the future.&quot; When greeted by a group of soldiers who shouted, &quot;Long Live Chairman Mao!&quot; (literally &quot;10,000 years for Chairman Mao&quot;), Peng addressed the soldiers by saying, &quot;You shout &#x27;10,000 years for Chairman Mao!&#x27; – does he, then, live for 10,000 years? He will not even live for 100 years! This is a personality cult!&quot; When one of Peng&#x27;s political commissars suggested that the Maoist hymn &quot;The East is Red&quot; should be widely taught throughout the PLA, Peng angrily rejected the suggestion, similarly by saying, &quot;That is a personality cult! That is idealism!&quot; Later in 1956, a group of soldiers visited Peng to request an audience with the chairman, but Peng rejected them by saying, &quot;He is an old man, what is so beautiful about him?&quot;

In preparation for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution. At the meeting, Peng suggested for a section in the Constitution&#x27;s preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought to be removed. Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it was removed from the final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was reappointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.

Peng resented Mao&#x27;s personal lifestyle, which Peng considered decadent and luxurious. By the late 1950s, Mao had developed a lifestyle that was out of touch with Peng&#x27;s preference for modesty and simplicity. Mao enjoyed a private pool in Zhongnanhai and had many villas around China built for him, which he would travel to on a private train. Mao enjoyed the companionship of an ever-changing succession of enthusiastic young women, whom he met either at weekly dances in Zhongnanhai or on his journeys by train. Mao had a costly office suite built for him in Beijing, including a private, book-lined study (which, according to Mao&#x27;s personal physician Li Zhisui, was never used). When Peng&#x27;s wife suggested for the couple to spend more free time visiting Mao&#x27;s quarters, Peng was reluctant and stated that Mao&#x27;s surroundings were &quot;too luxuriously furnished&quot; for him to tolerate. Throughout the 1950s, Peng continued to refer to the Chairman as &quot;Old Mao,&quot; an egalitarian title that was used among senior CCP leaders in the 1930s and 1940s.

=== Military activities ===

Peng staged his first offensive after becoming Defense Minister in January 1955 by attacking and occupying a chain of islands, part of Zhejiang, which were still held by the Kuomintang from which it occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai. That operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, which effectively prevented the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang.

Peng participated in a number of foreign trips throughout the communist world after he had become Defense Minister, the first time that he had traveled outside of China and North Korea. In May 1955 Peng visited East Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union and met with Wilhelm Pieck, Józef Cyrankiewicz, Nikita Khrushchev and Soviet Marshals Konstantin Rokossovsky and Georgy Zhukov. In September 1955, Peng traveled to Poland and the Soviet Union to attend the signing of the Warsaw Pact as an observer. From November 2 to December 3, 1957, Peng accompanied Mao on his second visit to the Soviet Union. From April 24 to June 13, 1959, Peng went on a &quot;military goodwill tour&quot; across the communist world and visited Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia.
After Peng had returned from his first tour abroad in September 1955, he began to implement his &quot;Four Great Systems&quot; seriously: the implementation of standardized military ranks, salaries, awards, and rules of conscription. On September 23, 1955, the State Council named Peng one of the ten marshals of the PLA, China&#x27;s highest military rank. (Before 1955, Chinese soldiers were assigned &quot;functions&quot; instead of ranks, such as &quot;company commander&quot;, or &quot;division commander&quot;.) PLA leaders were promoted into Peng&#x27;s new system of military ranks and were awarded new orders of merit. Peng himself was awarded the First Class Medal of the Order of August 1 (for his achievements in the Chinese Civil War from 1927 to 1937), the First Class Medal of the Order of Independence and Freedom (for his achievements in the Sino-Japanese War), and the First Class Medal of the Order of Liberation (for his achievements in the Chinese Civil War from 1945 to 1949). Peng introduced military insignia for the first time and issued military uniforms modeled on those worn by Soviet soldiers. On January 1, 1956, Peng replaced conscription with voluntary service and standardized career soldiers&#x27; salaries on eighteen grades from private second class to marshal. In May 1956, Peng introduced a clear prioritization of rank favoring commanders over political commissars. By September 1956, Peng&#x27;s doctrines of professionalism, strict training, discipline, and the mastery of modern equipment were entrenched within the structure of the PLA.

Mao opposed all of those initiatives but at first focused his dissatisfaction on other marshals, Liu Bocheng and Luo Ronghuan, whom Mao accused of &quot;dogmatism&quot; (uncritically assimilating methods borrowed from the Soviet Union). In 1958, Mao convinced Peng of the need to maintain a balance between military professionalism and political indoctrination, and Peng co-operated in removing Liu and Luo from high positions. Peng&#x27;s removal of Liu especially cost Peng the support of many other military leaders, and Mao used Liu&#x27;s resulting criticism of Peng to criticize Peng before other senior Chinese leaders the next year, when Mao then sought to remove Peng.
Peng was still in command of the PLA when Mao ordered the shelling of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands off the coast of Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a strategy with his chief of staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, which would eventually lead to the islands&#x27; surrender. Then, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China and began on August 28. The attack included a co-ordinated effort to cut off the islands&#x27; air and sea supply lines.

The campaign ran into unexpected difficulties and did not achieve its objectives. The Soviets did not give explicit support to the operation, and the United States provided air and sea cover to Kuomintang supply ships up to within three miles of the Chinese coast. Kuomintang fighter jets shot down 37 PRC fighters but only lost only 3 themselves, and Nationalist artillery and naval bombardments destroyed 25 PRC ships. Peng had quietly opposed the operation from the beginning and gradually began to end hostilities after the PLA had encountered serious difficulties by announcing a series of intermittent ceasefires and eventually halting the campaign in late October. Su Yu was blamed for the disaster and replaced with another ally of Peng, General Huang Kecheng. Peng&#x27;s position was not directly affected, but his personal prestige suffered, and the practical effects of his efforts to modernize China&#x27;s armed forces were called into question within the PLA. Su was accused of directing the aborted attack on Matzu and withdrawing troops from North Korea without authorization, and of secretly taking orders from the Soviets. The conflict between Su and Peng lingered throughout Peng&#x27;s life, and Su was not rehabilitated until after his death.

== Fall from power ==

=== The Great Leap Forward ===

In the autumn of 1957, Mao suggested a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China&#x27;s farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao&#x27;s theories on mass collectivization became the basis of the Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, tens of millions of people had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China&#x27;s leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.

Peng did not oppose Mao&#x27;s collectivization drive in the first phase of the Great Leap, from late 1957 to early 1958, but he increasingly opposed it from spring to winter 1958, as the problems which Mao&#x27;s policies had caused became more evident. In February 1958, Peng gave a speech for the fortieth anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, in which he suggested increased military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Mao opposed this suggestion, and began grooming Lin Biao as a viable successor to Peng for the position of Defense Minister. As part of the Great Leap Forward, Mao ordered the formation of a national militia that was controlled by Party members and independent of the PLA, eventually training and arming tens of millions of civilians.

Peng made regular inspection tours of the Chinese provinces after becoming Defense Minister in 1953. In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying &quot;The Chairman talks all the time about more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he want with chanting these liturgies all the time?&quot; On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap Forward. Mature crops were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: &quot;unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm.&quot; On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for &quot;steel&quot;, and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward:

: Grain scattered on the ground, potato leaves withered;
: Strong young people have left to make steel;
: Only children and old women reap the crops;
: How can they pass the coming year?
: Allow me to raise my voice for the people!

At an enlarged Politburo meeting in Shanghai, held from March 25 – April 1, Peng openly criticized Mao in the chairman&#x27;s presence for the first time, accusing him of &quot;taking personal command&quot; of national politics and disregarding the collective leadership of the Chinese government and the Party. Mao responded with vague criticisms of Peng, which Peng said was &quot;provocative&quot;. From April 24 – June 15 Peng left on a goodwill military tour through Eastern Europe. Peng met with Khrushchev on May 24, and was criticized during the Cultural Revolution for having criticized Mao&#x27;s leadership to the Soviet leader, but the evidence that Peng criticized Mao to Khrushchev is very circumstantial, and Mao did not mention this during his efforts to have Peng purged. Peng&#x27;s absence from China during the seven weeks that he was abroad allowed Mao to freely spread negative rumors discrediting Peng within the Party, and to develop consensus among other senior Party leaders to oppose Peng when he returned.

=== The Lushan Conference ===
The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee was held in the scenic resort town of Mount Lu, Jiujiang, on July 2, 1959, to discuss Party members&#x27; positions on the Great Leap Forward. Mao opened the conference by encouraging Party members to &quot;criticize and offer opinions&quot; on the government&#x27;s &quot;mistakes and shortcomings&quot;, and he promised that he would not attack any member personally as a &quot;rightist&quot; or &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; for any opinions expressed at the conference. Peng had returned to China just previous to the conference after spending seven weeks abroad and was not planning on attending the conference, but Mao personally phoned Peng and invited him to attend. Peng obeyed Mao and travelled to Mount Lu to participate in the conference.

Peng participated in group meetings in the early portion of the conference, gaining consensus among his peers for criticizing the widespread practice of inaccurately reporting agricultural statistics, and emphasizing that &quot;everybody had a share of responsibility, including Comrade Mao Zedong&quot;. Peng bluntly criticized the hesitation of senior Party members to disagree with the Party leadership, implying that many Party leaders were cowardly for following orders that they knew were not in the best interests of the Chinese people. After gaining the consensus of several of his peers, Peng developed his opinions more systematically, but was hesitant to bring up the full range of his criticisms in public. Peng discussed his thoughts with several other senior Party leaders (notably the CCP Secretary of Hunan, Zhou Xiaozhou (周小舟), and Peng&#x27;s colleagues encouraged Peng to visit Mao privately in order to win Mao&#x27;s support for a reversal of the policies of the Great Leap Forward. Peng visited Mao&#x27;s quarters on the night of July 13, but found Mao asleep, and wrote Mao a &quot;letter of opinion&quot; articulating Peng&#x27;s ideas instead. Peng delivered the letter to Mao on the morning of July 14, but Mao did not read the letter until July 17. Later on July 17 Mao had Peng&#x27;s letter widely circulated among the other delegates at the conference. Peng did not intend his letter to be widely read and attempted to prevent its circulation, but was not successful. Most other senior leaders, including Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, supported Peng&#x27;s position before Mao began to attack it, indicating that they shared Peng&#x27;s views and that they did not see Peng&#x27;s letter as an attack on the chairman.

In Peng&#x27;s letter, Peng compared himself to the courageous but tactless Han dynasty general Zhang Fei. Because of Mao&#x27;s appreciation of Zhang&#x27;s enemy, Cao Cao, Mao interpreted this as implying a confrontational relationship. Peng criticized the poor allocation of labour across China, especially the inefficient, country-wide practice of forcing farmers to work in backyard furnaces. He criticized the nationwide famine and severe shortage of cotton, and stated that the Chinese people were justified in demanding change from the present conditions. Peng blamed the problems of the Great Leap on what he called &quot;problems in our way of thinking and style of work&quot;, especially the tendency for Party administrators to submit exaggerated production reports, and for Party bureaucrats to accept these figures uncritically. Peng blamed the mistakes of the Party on a culture of &quot;petty bourgeois fanaticism&quot;, a tendency to believe in achieving change through blindly encouraging mass movements, and claimed that the acceptance of this culture had led to the Party leadership forgetting &quot;the mass-line and the style of seeking truth from facts&quot;, which Peng believed had led to the Communist victories over the Japanese and Kuomintang. Peng criticized Mao&#x27;s policy of &quot;putting politics in command&quot;, substituting economic principles and productive work for political objectives.

Mao&#x27;s decision to have Peng&#x27;s letter widely circulated completely changed the direction of the conference. On July 21, Zhang Wentian gave an independent, supplementary speech attacking Mao&#x27;s policies, and the same day a majority of delegates expressed their approval of Peng&#x27;s letter, making it an official conference document. Mao interpreted the letter as a personal attack, and began to defend himself on July 23, attacking Peng and those who disagreed with his policies. Mao defended his commune system by claiming that &quot;until now, not a single commune has collapsed&quot;. He attacked Peng and those who shared his political opinions as &quot;imperialists&quot; &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;, and &quot;rightists&quot;, and associated their positions with other Communist leaders who had led failed oppositions to Mao&#x27;s leadership, including Li Lisan, Wang Ming, Gao Gang, and Rao Shushi. Mao brought up an ultimatum, stating that, if the delegates of the conference sided with Peng, Mao would split the CCP, retreating into the countryside and leading the peasants to &quot;overthrow the government&quot;. The other senior leaders of the CCP, including Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi, were unwilling to risk splitting the Party, and sided with Mao in opposing Peng&#x27;s position.

From August 2, the conference debated whether Peng should be disciplined, what punishment Peng should receive, and for what reasons. On August 16 the conference passed two resolutions. The first resolution condemned Peng as the leader of an &quot;anti-Party clique&quot;, and called for Peng&#x27;s removal from the positions of Defense Minister and vice-chairman of the Military Commission. The resolution did not eject Peng from the CCP, and it allowed Peng to retain his position in the Politburo, but he was excluded from Politburo meetings for years. The second resolution recognized Mao&#x27;s dominance within the Party and subtly called for an end to the policies of the Great Leap Forward. After Mao had rallied the rest of the Party against him, Peng&#x27;s options were limited to stubbornly standing his ground, engaging in a humiliating self-criticism, or suicide. After private discussion with other senior leaders, Peng considered the prestige of Mao and the unity of the Party and agreed to make a self-criticism, which was publicly reviewed at the conference, in which he admitted that he had made &quot;severe mistakes&quot; associated with his &quot;rightist viewpoint&quot;, that he had been a follower of Li Lisan and Wang Ming, and in which he openly implicated his supporters in his &quot;mistakes&quot;. After the conference, Peng said privately to Zhou Enlai regarding his self-criticism: &quot;For the first time in my life, I have spoken out against my very heart!&quot; Mao purged most of Peng&#x27;s supporters from important offices following the conference, almost completely isolating Peng politically for the rest of his life. Peng later reflected that he was confused that Mao could have interpreted his private letter as a political attack, and wondered why, after thirty years of working together, Mao could not have discussed the matter privately with him, if Peng had indeed made the mistakes Mao claimed he did.

== Later life ==
In September 1959 Mao replaced Peng as Defense Minister with Lin Biao, which effectively ended Peng&#x27;s military career. Peng was relocated to a suburb of Beijing and forfeited his marshal&#x27;s uniform and military decorations. Lin reversed Peng&#x27;s reforms, abolished all signs and privileges of rank, purged officers considered sympathetic to the Soviets, directed soldiers to part-time work as industrial and agricultural laborers, and indoctrinated the armed forces in Mao Zedong Thought. Lin&#x27;s system of indoctrination made it clear that the party was clearly in command of China&#x27;s armed forces, and Lin ensured that the army&#x27;s political commissars enjoyed great power and status to see that his directives were followed. Lin implemented those reforms to please Mao but privately feared that they would weaken the PLA. Lin used his position as Minister of Defense to flatter Mao by using the army to promote Mao&#x27;s personality cult throughout China by devising and running a number of national Maoist propaganda campaigns based on the PLA. The most successful of Lin&#x27;s efforts to promote Mao&#x27;s personality cult was the &quot;learn from Lei Feng&quot; campaign, which Lin began in 1963.

=== Partial rehabilitation ===
After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under constant surveillance from the Central Guard Division of the PLA and was accompanied by a secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing, and her work as the party secretary of Beijing Normal University allowed her to visit only infrequently. Peng&#x27;s guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng until he threatened to complain to Mao. Peng&#x27;s niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and they became close. Peng spent most of his free time in renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng was not completely purged since even though he could no longer participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed to the members of the Politburo and State Council of which he was technically still a member. In 1960, Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.

In 1960 to 1961, the effects of Mao&#x27;s economic policies continued to produce widespread economic collapse. That improved Peng&#x27;s reputation among party leaders who secretly believed that Mao&#x27;s policies were a mistake and desired to reverse them. Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi led Party efforts to revive the Chinese economy and cultivated Peng&#x27;s friendship as part of a wider effort to gain widespread support for their activities. In November to December 1961, Peng received permission to leave his residence for the first time since 1959 to conduct an inspection tour of Hunan. Peng found the conditions there even worse than in 1959 and, in a January 1962 conference of 7,000 party leaders to determine party economic policies, repeated most of the criticisms that he had made at Lushan. On June 16, 1962, Peng submitted a document, his &quot;Letter of 80,000 Words,&quot; to Mao and the Politburo, which gave a full account of his life, admitted to several &quot;mistakes,&quot; defended himself against most of the accusations made against him at the Lushan Conference, requested to be readmitted to decision-making government bodies, and sharply criticized the economic policies of the Great Leap Forward. In his letter, Peng first wrote one of his most famous quotes: &quot;I want to be a Hai Rui!&quot; The efforts of Liu and Deng to rehabilitate Peng further were not initially successful. Peng was not allowed to attend the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth CCP Central Committee, held in September 1962, and the efforts to reverse the verdict on Peng made at the Lushan Conference failed. From 1962 to 1965, Peng continued to live in relative obscurity but was no longer under house arrest.

After Mao had purged Peng in 1959, he appointed Marshal He Long to the head of an office to investigate Peng&#x27;s past to find more reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and he stalled for over a year before he submitted his report. Mao&#x27;s prestige weakened when it became widely known that the Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a positive report that attempted to vindicate Peng.

In September 1965, Mao agreed to rehabilitate Peng by promoting him to a position managing the industrial development of Southwestern China, a project known as the Third Front. Peng initially refused the position and so Mao called him personally and convinced him to accept it by suggesting that the condemnation of Peng at the Lushan Conference may have been a mistake. Peng was then appointed &quot;Deputy Commander of the Great Third Line of Construction in Southwest China&quot; and &quot;Third Secretary of the Control Commission of the CPC&#x27;s Southwest Bureau.&quot; In practice, Peng&#x27;s responsibilities were to oversee the industrial development of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet with a focus on developing military industries and logistical networks. Those positions were far below Peng&#x27;s position before 1959 but signaled his return to national politics. Peng worked energetically until August 1966, when the beginning of the Cultural Revolution had him recalled to Chengdu, and the first Red Guards began patrolling the streets and violently attacking their perceived enemies. Peng&#x27;s bodyguards warned him to avoid contact with the Red Guards, but Peng disregarded their advice: &quot;a CPC member does not have to be afraid of the masses.&quot; Peng&#x27;s disregard for personal danger and his confidence in the party made him one of the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s first victims.

=== Persecution during Cultural Revolution ===

Peng was one of the first public figures singled out for persecution in 1966 by the Cultural Revolution Group. The Secretariat of the Party, attempted to shield Peng, but Mao&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing, took a personal interest in persecuting Peng and directed Red Guards in Sichuan to find Peng in Chengdu, arrest him, and deliver him to Beijing to be persecuted. Local Red Guards in Chengdu were not enthusiastic to follow the orders. They visited Peng&#x27;s house on December 22, 1966, and attempted to intimidate him by informing him of the recent arrests of some of his friends and comrades and the imminent arrests of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping. Because of local Red Guards&#x27; lack of enthusiasm to carry out Jiang Qing&#x27;s orders, a more radical Red Guard leader, Wang Dabin, arrived in Chengdu on December 24 and denounced his local comrades as &quot;rightists&quot; and &quot;traitors&quot; for delaying Peng&#x27;s arrest. The Red Guards then abducted Peng in the early morning of December 25, put him in chains, and ransacked his house. Peng&#x27;s bodyguards arrived to save Peng at around 4:00 a.m. but were already too late.

Premier Zhou Enlai made an effort to save Peng by placing him under PLA surveillance. On December 25, Zhou&#x27;s office ordered the Red Guards who had abducted Peng to accompany members of the PLA from Chengdu, deliver Peng to Beijing by train (instead of by plane since the airports in Sichuan had been taken over by Red Guards), and deliver Peng to the Beijing PLA garrison. After the party arrived in Beijing, Wang Dabin successfully directed Red Guards under his command to delay the PLA unit scheduled to take possession of Peng and succeeded in keeping Peng from being saved.

In January 1967, Peng was taken to his first &quot;struggle session&quot; in which he was paraded in chains before several thousand jeering Red Guards, wearing a large paper dunce cap and with a wooden board hung from his neck on which his &quot;crimes&quot; were written. In the fall, Peng was held at a PLA military prison outside Beijing and was allowed to receive extra clothing. In July, Mao and Lin Biao, co-operating with Jiang Qing&#x27;s faction, ordered the PLA to form an &quot;investigation group&quot; to determine Peng&#x27;s &quot;crimes&quot; so that Peng could be more thoroughly humiliated in future struggle sessions. Peng&#x27;s jailers attempted to force Peng to confess that he was a &quot;great warlord,&quot; a &quot;great ambitionist,&quot; and a &quot;great conspirator&quot; who had &quot;crept into the Party and the Army.&quot; Peng refused to confess to those accusations or to &quot;surrender to the masses&quot; and so his jailers strapped Peng to the floor of an unlit cell and did not allow him to stand or sit up, drink water, rise to go to the toilet, or move in his sleep for several days. After Peng still refused to &quot;confess,&quot; his jailers began routinely beating him and broke several ribs, injured his back, and damaged his internal organs, especially his lungs. Peng&#x27;s violent &quot;interrogations&quot; lasted over ten hours a day, but his interrogators were replaced every two hours to keep them from developing any sympathy for Peng, a practice pioneered by the Stalinist secret police in the 1930s. Peng was &quot;interrogated&quot; that way over 130 times. During interrogations he shouted denials to the Red Guards who beat him, and it is reputed that he pounded the table so hard that the cell walls shook.

In late July 1967, following the failed Wuhan Uprising, party leaders decided that Peng should be used as an example by publicly humiliating him by name at a national level. On July 31, an article appeared that was distributed nationally and directed the nation to take part in vilifying him. In the article, Peng was called a &quot;capitalist,&quot; a &quot;great ambitionist,&quot; and a &quot;great conspirator&quot; who had &quot;always opposed Chairman Mao&quot; and who was &quot;the representative of the greatest capitalist-roader [Liu Shaoqi] in the army.&quot; The article accused Peng of conspiring with foreign countries; allying with &quot;imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries;&quot; and waging &quot;a wild attack against the Party.&quot; The campaign of national vilification against Peng lasted several months until late 1967. On August 16, another article stated that Peng &quot;was never a Marxist&quot; but that he had instead been a &quot;capitalist great warlord&quot; who had &quot;crept into the Party and into the army... we have to struggle against him until he falls, until he breaks down, until he stinks.&quot; CCP propagandists made an effort to discredit Peng&#x27;s military career by portraying it as a long string of failures except for the battles that were supposedly directed closely by Mao and to convince the Chinese people that Peng was a subhuman villain who should be destroyed without compassion or mercy.

In August 1967, Peng was taken to a &quot;struggle meeting,&quot; which was held in a stadium attended by 40,000 PLA soldiers. At the meeting, Peng was led in chains to a stage, where he was forced to kneel for several hours while he listened to soldiers repeatedly denouncing him for his &quot;crimes.&quot; At the end of the meeting, Lin Biao personally appeared to the soldiers, where he addressed the assembled soldiers and Peng, who was still kneeling. Lin gave a speech in which he denounced Peng as a villainous element who must be purged and that it was &quot;in the interest of the whole Party, the whole army, and the whole people of the whole country&quot; to persecute him so severely. Lin then addressed Peng directly: &quot;If you reform yourself, all right, if not, it is all right too. But of course we hope you reform yourself.&quot; It is not known whether Peng eventually broke down and &quot;confessed&quot; at the rally.

Peng was imprisoned for the rest of his life. In 1969, the party formed a &quot;special investigation group&quot; to reach a verdict in his case. Peng&#x27;s jailers then forced him to write a full biography of his life many times, but they did not believe that he ever fully confessed his &quot;crimes.&quot; Peng was then subjected to constant violent &quot;interrogations&quot; throughout most of 1970 until a special military tribune sentenced Peng to life imprisonment. The sentence was immediately approved by Lin Biao&#x27;s General Chief of Staff, Huang Yongsheng.

After the 1971 Lin Biao incident, the military attempted to improve Peng&#x27;s living conditions, but the years of deprivation and torture from 1967 to 1970 had seriously weakened his physical health, and from late 1972 to his death, Peng was seriously ill probably from tuberculosis, thrombosis, or both. Peng was briefly hospitalized in 1973 before he was returned to prison, the first time that he had been outside of prison since 1967. Peng&#x27;s niece, Peng Meikui, visited Peng in the hospital and convinced his jailers to allow an operation, but the nature and the results of this operation are unknown. Peng&#x27;s medical condition deteriorated further in 1974. According to Jurgen Domes, there is &quot;some scattered evidence&quot; that he received no substantial medical aid because of Mao&#x27;s direct order. On the other hand, David Shambaugh states that he was instead denied medical aid by the directive of Mao&#x27;s wife, Jiang Qing. Peng died at 3:35 p.m. on November 29, 1974. His last wish was to see Zhu De on his deathbed. The request was denied and when Zhu learnt of Peng&#x27;s wish, after his death, he reportedly burst into tears.

Peng Meikui was allowed to view her uncle&#x27;s body for twenty minutes but was then removed. Peng&#x27;s body was quickly cremated, and his ashes were sent to Chengdu, identified only by a note that read, &quot;No. 327 – Wang Chuan, from Chengdu.&quot;

== Posthumous rehabilitation ==
The leadership of the CCP successfully concealed Peng&#x27;s death for several years and successfully convinced the only civilian witness, Peng Meikui, not to tell anyone of Peng&#x27;s death. Peng&#x27;s former bodyguards did not learn of his death until 1976. His wife, Pu Anxiu, had also been arrested by Red Guards and &quot;sentenced&quot; to a &quot;labour reform camp,&quot; where she remained until 1975, when she was released to settle as a farmer in Northern China. She did not find out about Peng&#x27;s death until she was allowed to return to Beijing in 1978, when the news was first publicly disclosed.

Mao died in 1976. Following a brief power struggle, Peng&#x27;s former ally, Deng Xiaoping, emerged as the paramount leader of China. One of Deng&#x27;s first political goals was to rehabilitate party members who had been condemned and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. By 1978, many people, led by General Huang Kecheng, who had been a comrade of Peng&#x27;s since Peng rebelled against the Kuomintang in 1928, were agitating for Peng&#x27;s posthumous rehabilitation. The Chinese government formally reversed the &quot;erroneous&quot; verdict of Peng during the 3rd plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, held from December 18 to 22, 1978. Deng gave a speech announcing Peng&#x27;s rehabilitation:

He was courageous in battle, open and straightforward, incorruptible and impeccable, and strict towards himself. He cared about the masses, and was never concerned about his own advantage. He was never afraid of difficulties, neither of carrying heavy loads. In his revolutionary work, he was diligent, honest, and he had an utmost sense of responsibility.

Deng&#x27;s speech also stated that Mao&#x27;s decision in 1959, which vilified Peng as the leader of an &quot;anti-Party clique,&quot; had been &quot;entirely wrong&quot; and that it had &quot;undermined intra-Party democracy.&quot; From January 1979, the party encouraged historians and those who had known Peng to produce many memoirs, historical stories, and articles praising and remembering him. In 1980, the Intermediate Court of Justice in Wuhan sentenced Wang Dabin, the Red Guard who had directed Peng&#x27;s arrest in 1966, to nine years in prison for &quot;the persecution and torture of Comrade Peng Dehuai.&quot;

Following the conclusion of memorial services, Peng&#x27;s ashes were interred at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. In December 1999, Peng&#x27;s nephew and niece moved his ashes out of Babaoshan and buried them at his hometown of Wushi in Hunan.

In 1986, an &quot;autobiography&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of a Chinese Marshal&quot;, was compiled from various documents that Peng had written about his life. Much of the material for &quot;Memoirs&quot; was drawn from the &quot;confessions&quot; that Peng had written during the Cultural Revolution, and the book focused on Peng&#x27;s early life, before the Sino-Japanese War. In 1988, China released a set of stamps to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Peng&#x27;s birth. In modern China, Peng is considered one of the greatest military leaders of the twentieth century.

<text>A government-in-exile (GiE) is a political group that claims to be the legitimate government of a sovereign state or semi-sovereign state, but is unable to exercise legal power and instead resides in a foreign country. Governments in exile usually plan to one day return to their native country and regain formal power. A government in exile differs from a rump state in the sense that the latter controls at least part of its remaining territory. For example, during World War I, nearly all of Belgium was occupied by Germany, but Belgium and its allies held on to a small slice in the country&#x27;s west. A government in exile, in contrast, has lost all its territory. However, in practice the difference might be minor; in the above example, the Belgian government at Sainte-Adresse was located in French territory and acted as a government in exile for most practical purposes. Governments-in-exile and associated organisations employ strategies such as investigative reporting and diaspora mobilisation to sustain political visibility, engage supporters, and address ethical and operational challenges.

Governments in exile tend to occur during wartime occupation or in the aftermath of a civil war, revolution, or military coup. For example, during German expansion and advance in World War II, some European governments sought refuge in the United Kingdom, rather than face destruction at the hands of Nazi Germany. On the other hand, the Provisional Government of Free India proclaimed by Subhas Chandra Bose sought to use support from the invading Japanese to gain control of the country from what it viewed as British occupiers, and in the final year of WWII, after Nazi Germany was driven out of France, it maintained the remnants of the Nazi-sympathizing Vichy government as a French government in exile at the Sigmaringen enclave.

A government in exile may also form from widespread belief in the illegitimacy of a ruling government. Due to the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, for instance, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces was formed by groups whose members sought to end the rule of the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party.

The governments in exile may have little or no recognition from other states. The effectiveness of a government in exile depends primarily on the amount of support it receives, either from foreign governments or from the population of its own country. Some exiled governments come to develop into a formidable force, posing a serious challenge to the incumbent regime of the country, while others are maintained chiefly as a symbolic gesture.

The phenomenon of a government in exile predates the formal utilization of the term. In periods of monarchical government, exiled monarchs or dynasties sometimes set up exile courts, as the House of Stuart did when driven from their throne by Oliver Cromwell and again at the Glorious Revolution (see ). The House of Bourbon would be another example because it continued to be recognized by other countries at the time as the legitimate government of France after it was overthrown by the populace during the French Revolution. This continued to last through the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic Wars from 1803–04 to 1815. With the spread of constitutional monarchy, monarchical governments which were exiled started to include a prime minister, such as the Dutch government during World War II headed by Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy.

The capital of a government-in-exile is known as a capital-in-exile, located outside the government&#x27;s proclaimed territory. This differs from a temporary capital, which is located somewhere inside the government&#x27;s controlled territory.

== Current governments in exile ==
=== Current governments regarded by some as a &quot;government-in-exile&quot; ===
These governments once controlled all or most of their claimed territory, but continue to control a smaller part of it while also continuing to claim legitimate authority of the entire territory they once fully controlled.
=== Deposed governments of current states ===
These governments in exile were founded by deposed governments or rulers who continue to claim legitimate authority of the state they once controlled.

=== Deposed governments of subnational territories ===
These governments in exile claim legitimacy of autonomous territories of another state and have been founded by deposed governments or rulers, who do not claim independence as a separate state.

=== Alternative governments of current states ===
These governments have been founded in exile by political organisations and opposition parties, aspire to become actual governing authorities or claim to be legal successors to previously deposed governments, and have been founded as alternatives to incumbent governments.


=== Alternative separatist governments of current subnational territories ===

These governments have been founded in exile by political organisations, opposition parties, and separatist movements, and desire to become the governing authorities of their territories as independent states, or claim to be the successor to previously deposed governments, and have been founded as alternatives to incumbent governments.

=== Exiled governments of non-self-governing or occupied territories ===
These governments in exile are governments of non-self-governing or occupied territories. They claim legitimate authority over a territory they once controlled, or claim legitimacy of a post-decolonization authority. The claim may stem from an exiled group&#x27;s election as a legitimate government.

The United Nations recognizes the right of self-determination for the population of these territories, including the possibility of establishing independent sovereign states.
== Former governments in exile ==
=== World War II ===

Many countries established a government in exile after loss of sovereignty in connection with World War II.

==== Governments in London ====
A large number of European governments-in-exile were set up in London.

Other exiled leaders in Britain in this time included King Zog of Albania and Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.

Occupied Denmark did not establish a government in exile, although there was an Association of Free Danes established in London. The government remained in Denmark and functioned with relative independence until August 1943 when it was dissolved, placing Denmark under full German occupation. Meanwhile, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands were occupied by the Allies and effectively separated from the Danish crown. (See British occupation of the Faroe Islands, Iceland during World War II, and History of Greenland during World War II.)

==== Governments-in-exile in Asia ====
The Philippine Commonwealth (invaded 9 December 1941) established a government in exile, initially located in Australia and later in the United States. Earlier, in 1897, the Hong Kong Junta was established as a government in exile by the Philippine revolutionary Republic of Biak-na-Bato.

While formed long before World War II, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea continued in exile in China until the end of the war.

At the fall of Java, and the surrender by the Dutch on behalf of Allied forces on 8 March 1942, many Dutch-Indies officials (including Dr van Mook and Dr Charles van der Plas) managed to flee to Australia in March 1942, and on 23 December 1943, the Royal Government (Dutch) decreed an official Netherlands East Indies government-in-exile, with Dr van Mook as Acting Governor General, on Australian soil until Dutch rule was restored in the Indies.

==== Axis-aligned governments in exile ====
In the later stages of World War II, with the German Army increasingly pushed back and expelled from various countries, Axis-aligned groups from some countries set up &quot;governments-in-exile&quot; under the auspices of the Axis powers, in the remaining Axis territory - even though internationally recognized governments were in place in their home countries. The main purpose of these was to recruit and organize military units composed of their nationals in the host country.

=== Persian Gulf War ===
Following the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait, during the Persian Gulf War, on 2 August 1990, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and senior members of his government fled to Saudi Arabia, where they set up a government-in-exile in Ta&#x27;if. The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive propaganda campaign denouncing the Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi occupation and mobilizing public opinion in the Western world in favor of war with Ba&#x27;athist Iraq. In March 1991, following the defeat of Ba&#x27;athist Iraq at the hands of coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War, the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.

=== Municipal councils in exile ===
Following the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the displacement of many Greek Cypriots from North Cyprus, displaced inhabitants of several towns set up what are in effect municipal councils in exile, headed by mayors in exile. The idea is the same as with a national government in exile—to assert a continuation of legitimate rule, even though having no control of the ground, and working towards restoration of such control. Meetings of the exiled Municipal Council of Lapithos took place in the homes of its members until the Exile Municipality was offered temporary offices at 37 Ammochostou Street, Nicosia. The current Exile Mayor of the town is Athos Eleftheriou. The same premises are shared with the Exile Municipal Council of Kythrea.

Also in the Famagusta District of Cyprus, the administration of the part retained by the Republic of Cyprus considers itself as a &quot;District administration in exile&quot;, since the district&#x27;s capital Famagusta had been under Turkish control since 1974.

== Fictional governments in exile ==
Works of alternate history as well as science fictional depictions of the future sometimes include fictional governments in exile.
* In Len Deighton&#x27;s &quot;SS-GB&quot;, the UK is defeated in World War II and occupied by Germany. The story features a British government-in-exile in Washington, D.C.
* In &quot;If Israel Lost the War&quot; by Robert Littell, Richard Z. Chesnoff and Edward Klein, Israel is defeated in the 1967 Six-Day War and its territory occupied by Arab armies. Thereupon, David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir set up an Israeli government in exile in North America.
* Algis Budrys&#x27; &quot;The Falling Torch&quot; is set in a future time when Earth was conquered and occupied by extraterrestrial humanoid invaders. Many years later, the Earth government in exile, located at a human colony planet orbiting Alpha Centauri, is holding a regular meeting in an atmosphere of dejection and futility—its hosts being indifferent to Earth&#x27;s plight and unwilling to offer any real help. The exile prime minister is shown more involved with his successful career as the chef of a luxury hotel than with the seemingly non-existent hope of liberating Earth. This depiction might have drawn on the writer&#x27;s actual experience as a member of the exile Lithuanian community in the 1950s US, at the time seeing little hope of shaking the Soviet hold of its homeland.
* In the &quot;Hearts of Iron IV&quot; mod, &quot;Kaiserreich&quot; (which portrays an alternate history where Germany wins World War I), the former governments of France, Britain, and Italy are exiled to Algeria, Canada, and Sardinia, respectively, after syndicalist revolutionaries assume control.

<doc id="241909" wikidata="Q752269" url="?curid=241909" title="Gohan">
<text>is a fictional character in the Japanese franchise &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; created by Akira Toriyama. Gohan is the first son of the protagonist Son Goku and his wife Chi-Chi and made his appearance in chapter #196 &quot;Kakarrot&quot;, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on October 8, 1988.

Chi-Chi is a strict and protective mother to Gohan, forcing him to focus on school and forbidding him from practicing martial arts. However, due to the various threats to the Earth, she reluctantly allows him to fight. Gohan is initially trained by his father&#x27;s former nemesis Piccolo, ultimately becoming one of the strongest characters in the series due to his hidden potential, awakened by his rage.

Akira Toriyama originally aimed Gohan to succeed Goku as the series&#x27; protagonist but such idea was scrapped in the manga&#x27;s final arc. Nevertheless, Toriyama used him as a lead in the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, to reuse his dynamic with Piccolo. In Japanese, he is voiced by Masako Nozawa in all animated appearances and most media.

Gohan has been well received by both fans and critics, the latter usually citing the character&#x27;s growth from his initial appearance to his defeat of Cell. However, his characterization after the Cell arc has received a more mixed reception. His return as a protagonist in &quot;Super Hero&quot; earned a better response for his continuous growth and role as a family man aided by Piccolo.

==Creation and design==
Gohan&#x27;s name comes from the Japanese word , a continuation of the naming scheme of foods by Toriyama. Rice, being a grain, is not normally considered to be a vegetable, even though it is a common food. However, as the word &quot;vegetable&quot; is a culinary term, and not a botanical term, the name can also continue the naming scheme for Saiyan characters, which derives names from puns on vegetables. In conceptualizing for Gohan&#x27;s character, Toriyama originally included glasses or a jacket to his apparel, and commonly, his hair is spiked up as seen in the final design. With the ending of the Cell arc, Gohan was meant to replace his father as the protagonist. However, Toriyama later decided against it, finding the character unsuited for the role in comparison to his father.

In contrast, Gohan is the main focus of the film &quot;Super Hero&quot;. The movie is meant to change the focus of overpowered characters like Goku and Vegeta against Broly in the previous film and instead focus on Gohan and Piccolo as leads and thus bring a change of pace. One of the main fights is Gohan&#x27;s and Gamma 1&#x27;s which takes place during rain. Director Tetsuro Kodama found that this setting would be appealing. The narrative will further explore human drama, most notably the characterization of Gohan being a warrior as well as a scholar at the same time. Toriyama said that he wanted the plot to focus on the dynamic between Gohan and Piccolo due to how their close relationship is the one thing that motivates the former even more than his father, Goku, in order to be determined to fight. The film reveals the full awakening of Gohan&#x27;s power through yet another instance of pure rage. This is a culmination of his history of volcanic awakenings throughout his life. Toriyama feared it would come across as scary due to his angry expression but tried balancing it with the hair, ultimately settling on a more simplistic approach.

In an interview featured in the second &quot;Dragon Ball GT Perfect Files&quot;, a companion book released in December 1997 by Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Jump Comics Selection&quot; imprint, Masako Nozawa, Gohan&#x27;s voice actress, stated that her favorite episode voicing Gohan was &quot;Sorry, Robot-san - The Desert of Vanishing Tears&quot;. Saffron Henderson, Gohan&#x27;s original English voice actor, has stated she felt protective of the role and considers it to be one of her favorites. In addition, Gohan&#x27;s original Funimation voice actor, Stephanie Nadolny has said that playing Gohan was a unique and much-loved experience.

===Voice actors===

Gohan is voiced in the original Japanese anime and all other media by Masako Nozawa. Nozawa, who also voices Goku, revealed that she did not know she would be playing Gohan until receiving the script on the day of recording his debut episode. Despite having to voice Gohan, Goku, Goten and Bardock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image.

In Funimation and Saban Entertainment initial 1996 English dub of Dragon Ball Z, Gohan is voiced by Saffron Henderson. Henderson reprised her role in AB Group and Westwood Media&#x27;s alternate dub for the UK and Canadian markets in 2000. Jillian Michaels replaced Henderson in the later part of the Cell arc, while his adult version is voiced by Brad Swaile. Henderson believed her experience playing Goku in Dragon Ball made it simple to develop Gohan&#x27;s voice, though stressed performing as him was &quot;tiring&quot; due to the action of the series requiring louder volumes. She also remembered scheduling conflicts thanks to her wedding, setting the stage for the studio to audition other voice actors for the part of Gohan, and being disappointed at the role being recast.

In Funimation&#x27;s in-house dub, Gohan&#x27;s child incarnation is voiced by Stephanie Nadolny for various media until 2010 and Colleen Clinkenbeard for &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot; and later media while his adult incarnation is voiced by Kyle Hebert for almost all various media and Dameon Clarke as &quot;Future Gohan&quot; for some episodes and the &quot;History of Trunks&quot; TV special. Nadolny was called in to audition in 1999, when the English dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; was recast. She said her most challenging time voicing the character was during his fight against Cell where she had to make him sound as &quot;deep, tough and as much like a man as possible.&quot; Nadolny&#x27;s voice was strained during the recordings, causing her to sometimes leave the studio in pain. Hebert said that his roles as Gohan and the narrator of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; are close to him as they kickstarted his career. He also found &quot;Battle of Gods&quot; to be &quot;genuinely touching&quot; outside of its fighting, citing Gohan finding out that he was going to be a father among the moments he found sentimental and was happy to return to the franchise when reprising his role in &quot;Resurrection &#x27;F&quot;&#x27;, also expressing interest in redoing his lines in Dragon Ball Kai as he had more experience.

In the English dub of Dragon Ball GT produced by Blue Water Studios distributed in Canada, he was voiced by Scott Roberts. In the English dub of movies distributed in Europe by AB Groupe, Gohan was voiced by Jodi Forrest, with David Gasman voicing Gohan as an adult in &quot;The History of Trunks&quot;. In the Toonami Asia dub produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, Gohan here is voiced by Chris Hackney.

In a rare English dub of the anime produced in the Philippines by Creative Products Corporation, Gohan was voiced by Ethel Lizano who also directed that dub. In the 1996 dub of the double feature combining &quot;Cooler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;The Return of Cooler&quot; also by Creative Products Corp.; young Gohan was voiced by E.J. Galang, who was 12 years old at the time he voiced Gohan.

==Abilities==
Gohan possesses superhuman strength and durability, as well as superhuman speed and reflexes, as seen during his training with his younger brother Goten. As a child, Gohan is depicted with an immense amount of hidden potential, which at first only revealed itself when he experienced fierce rage or distress. The vastness of this potential is shown consistently throughout the series as he ages and learns to master his powers from constant training and battles, the earliest example was during his short fight with Raditz. Gohan&#x27;s potential was unlocked twice in the series: first by the Namekian Grand Elder, and then further unlocked by the Old Kaiō-shin, which sees his power level rise to new heights, capable of easily overwhelming the seemingly invincible Majin Buu.

As a Half-Saiyan, he has the ability to become an Oozaru, a gigantic ape-like creature, by absorbing waves from a full moon. He lost this ability after his tail was cut by Piccolo, and later Vegeta. He was the third youngest Saiyan to achieve the Super Saiyan transformation at the age of nine whilst training and surpassing his father Goku in the Room of Spirit and Time (Hyperbolic Time Chamber) and as a display of his hidden potential which he unlocked during his training with his father, Gohan becomes the first Saiyan in the series to become a Super Saiyan 2 during his battle against Cell. Though Gohan had gotten much weaker due to making the mistake of not training after the Cell Games, he became stronger than he ever has after his potential was unlocked from Old Kaiō-shin. Gohan with this power up was stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks since he was able to dominate Super Buu with ease without transforming.

Ever since this fight, Gohan has given up on fighting and has continually gotten weaker to the point that he can&#x27;t use his Super Saiyan transformations without straining himself. Gohan can still hold his own against Frieza&#x27;s soldiers, Shisami, and Tagoma in his base form and overpower them when he transforms into a Super Saiyan. After Frieza&#x27;s attack on Earth, Gohan returned to training with Piccolo. During his training with Piccolo before the start of the Tournament of Power, Gohan is pushed beyond his limits and manages to unlock his hidden power once again, becoming stronger than ever before. After this, he has shown that he is now able to combat foes of God-level might, having been able to hold his own in a sparring match against his father Goku in his Super Saiyan Blue form, and hold his own against Frieza in his Golden Frieza form. In the manga, Gohan manages to stalemate the fused fighter, Kefla.

Once again awakening his power through immeasurable fury, upon unlocking the so-called , Gohan was completely unaffected by Cell Max&#x27;s attacks and easily defeated him. Gohan in this new form was stated to be the strongest fighter on Earth, and is said to be even stronger than Broly. In the Manga, Gohan&#x27;s Beast form is shown to allow him to fight on even terms with Goku in Ultra Instinct.

Gohan has the ability to freely manipulate a life-force energy known as &quot;ki&quot; to fly using . He can also concentrate his &quot;ki&quot; to fire blasts of energy, such as the , inherited from his father, or the , taught to him by Piccolo. In addition to this move, his training with Piccolo inherited Gohan his other techniques, such as the in a number of video games, before properly using it in the main series continuity, against Cell Max. He has displayed the use of his &quot;ki&quot; in a defensive manner, such as generating protective energy shields. Both as a child and an adult, Gohan is known to be a capable swordsman, as well as an adept teacher.

==Appearances==
=== &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;===

Gohan is introduced as the four-year-old son of Goku and Chi-Chi, named after Goku&#x27;s adoptive grandfather. Described as well-mannered and reserved, Gohan is abducted by the extraterrestrial Saiyan named Raditz, revealed to be his paternal uncle. While Goku is pinned to the ground, Gohan&#x27;s extreme distress explodes with the release of his dormant power, which allows him to injure Raditz. With Goku training in the realm of the dead, Piccolo trains him for the upcoming battle against the two other Saiyans, Vegeta and Nappa. His tutelage under Piccolo forms a deep bond between the two characters, with Piccolo ultimately sacrificing himself to save Gohan during their fight with Nappa. After Vegeta&#x27;s defeat, Gohan travels with Bulma and Krillin to planet Namek to use the Dragon Balls there to revive their fallen friends. Gohan and the others wish Piccolo back to life, causing Kami and the Dragon Balls to be returned. Gohan, along with Krillin and Vegeta, are then forced into an encounter with Frieza. After a long fight, Gohan is replaced by Goku. In the final fight, the Dragon Balls bring everybody from Namek to Earth. Frieza is found in space by his father, King Cold, and is turned into a cyborg.

Years later, Trunks kills Frieza and warns Goku about the appearance of Androids. Gohan goes into the wilderness with Goku and Piccolo to train for the upcoming threat. In the upcoming battle, they are unable to defeat Dr. Gero&#x27;s creations, Gohan enters the Room of Spirit and Time with Goku where they train for 1 year in a single day. Gohan makes the jump to Super Saiyan while he is in the chamber and after they emerge, both Goku and Gohan retain the physical characteristics of a Super Saiyan. In the tournament organized by the android Cell, Goku tells his son to replace him in the battle. With Gohan being unable to use the rage Goku told him, Cell tortures him by harming his friends with his own children. After Android #16 is murdered by Cell, Gohan unleashes his rage and full power. Gohan easily defeats the Cell Juniors and proceeds to toy with Cell. However, Cell, attempts to self-destruct when transformed back and Goku dies with him. Cell returns, having regenerated from a single Cell that survived the blast. Right before Cell is about to finish Vegeta, Gohan intercedes which costs him the use of his left arm. As Cell charges up one final &quot;Kamehameha&quot; wave to finish the Earth, Gohan hears the voice of his father who gives him the resolve to attack with the father-son kamehameha. Gohan unleash all his fury into his attack, which kills Cell.

The Gohan of the alternate timeline, referred to as &quot;Future Gohan&quot;, to distinguish him from the character&#x27;s present-timeline incarnation, is presented in the volume #33 sidestory of the original manga, &quot;Trunks the Story&quot; and its film adaptation &quot;Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks&quot;, in which he is shown to be the only surviving fighter; the others have all died at the hands of the androids (sans Goku due to having died from a heart virus 6 months prior to the androids&#x27; arrival). Gohan is shown training Trunks to assist him in battling Androids #17 and #18. In this timeline, Gohan has become a Super Saiyan and is depicted wearing a uniform similar to his father&#x27;s, one with his own kanji symbol on the back, &quot;Han&quot;, . Gohan states he wears it in hopes of becoming as strong as his father one day, and is mentioned that he bears a striking resemblance to Goku when donning it. He eventually loses his left arm fighting Androids #17 and #18. He is ultimately killed by the two androids during a battle where they ganged up on Gohan, killing him with machine gun-like &quot;ki&quot; blasts. This is only depicted in the anime; his cause of death is left ambiguous in the manga, where he is already dead by the time Trunks arrives at the scene.

In the present-timeline, Gohan is shown enrolled at Orange Star High School in Satan City. After foiling crimes as a Super Saiyan he earns the alias the from the public. In order to hide his identity, and with help from Bulma, he adopts a superhero persona that he dubs the . When his peer, Videl figures out his identity as the Great Saiyaman, she blackmails him into attending the 25th Tenkaichi Budōkai and teaching her to fly. Over time, the two begin to bond together and eventually form a relationship. Gohan is depicted as having grown weaker, which the &quot;Daizenshū World Guide&quot; book explains as due to a lack of training and anger in transforming. Gohan, after having his &quot;chi&quot; absorbed by Spopovich and Yamu, pursues the two and enters Bobbidi&#x27;s spaceship with the Kaiō-shin, Goku and Vegeta, where Gohan later fights with Dabura. Following Majin Buu‘s release and Gohan&#x27;s defeat at his hands, Gohan is taken to the home planet of the Kaiō-shin. After pulling out the Zeta Sword (Known in the English Funimation Dub as the Z Sword) and accidentally breaking it in a training session, Gohan unwittingly releases the Old Kaiō-shin, who then performs a prolonged ceremony to unlock Gohan&#x27;s latent powers. Gohan then returns to Earth and confronts Buu for a second time, and easily defeats him. However, his victory is temporary, as he is overpowered when Buu absorbs Gotenks and Piccolo. He is later absorbed by Buu. Though Goku and Vegeta manage to rescue him along with Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo, he is killed when Buu (now in his pure form) destroys the Earth. Once revived, Gohan is able to aid Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-dama&quot; by lending his &quot;chi&quot;. Following Buu&#x27;s defeat and a ten-year gap, Gohan has finally become a scholar, is married with Videl and they have a daughter Pan.

=== &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; ===
In &quot;Battle of Gods&quot;, Gohan fights Beerus and provides his aid in transforming his father into a Super Saiyan God, with his unborn daughter Pan, also contributing as well, and in &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Gohan confronts the resurrected Frieza and avoids being killed with the majority of the Earth&#x27;s population thanks to a save by Whis.

After the latter two films&#x27; events, Gohan decides to resume his training with Piccolo, vowing to protect his family and not repeat the same mistake he did slacking off in his training. Following a short time of civilian life, where he is unable to participate in the Universe 6 vs Universe 7 tournament thanks to a scheduling conflict, and Gohan turns down a new job and with Pan already born, he is reunited with Trunks, being unaware of his reason to return to the past until after Goku, Trunks and Vegeta have had multiple encounters with Goku Black and he goes in search of his father. After Pan gets sick, Gohan has Shenlong to cure her and Gohan later follows Goku around after Hit targets Goku. Gohan becomes a stuntman for a movie featuring his Great Saiyaman persona against Mr. Satan, defeating Watagash and being attacked by Jaco, who thinks Gohan is Watagash&#x27;s new host. Gohan then defeats a Watagash possessed Barry Karn.

Citing a desire to protect his family, Gohan participates in Zen-Oh-sama&#x27;s Universal Survival tournament for the Universe 7 team. In the exhibition round, Gohan is matched against Universe 9&#x27;s Lavender, who fires a mist into his eyes that blinds him. Gohan powers up, causing the poison to accelerate through his body, and he knocks out Lavender to the ground, thus winning the fight. While Gohan and Goku recruit fighters for the Tournament of Power, Gohan is outsmarted by Krillin in a sparring match after being blinded with the &quot;Solar Flare x 100&quot;, leading him to get eliminated from that sparring match. 
Gohan&#x27;s training with Piccolo, during which Piccolo chastises Gohan for being reckless as a result of wanting to protect his family, concludes with Gohan becoming stronger than ever before and the two agreeing to develop combination moves. Gohan then challenges Goku to a duel, Gohan shows power that rivals Goku but still loses the match. Goku is impressed with his son&#x27;s power and decides to make him the captain of their team in the Tournament of Power. In the Tournament of Power, Gohan defeats Universe 6&#x27;s Botamo, Universe 10&#x27;s Obuni, Universe 6&#x27;s Saonel and Pirina, and Universe 3&#x27;s Anilaza before Universes 7 and 11 become the only remaining teams in the tournament. Gohan initially partners with Android 17 to battle Toppo, firing a &quot;Kamehameha&quot; wave at Android 17 and Toppo while they are inside Android 17&#x27;s barrier in effort to ring them out, though Gohan retracts the beam out of concern for Android 17. Gohan breaks away from the fight with Toppo and comes to Frieza&#x27;s aid against Dyspo, Gohan defeats Dyspo and holds him down while both of them are blasted out of bounds by Frieza.

Months later, Gohan, along with the Z fighters, await for the arrival of Moro, who is approaching Earth. Gohan fights off Moro and henchmen long enough for Goku and Vegeta to arrive back to Earth. Gohan then lends Goku some of his energy to help kill Moro.

Gohan appears as the supporting protagonist of &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, alongside his mentor, Piccolo, rather than his father and Vegeta, both having trained off-world. In the film, when the resusciated Red Ribbon Army plots to once again get back at Goku and his family for its destruction, a disguised Piccolo takes advantage of it and uses this event as a way to motivate Gohan, who has gone somewhat docile from peacetime and his studying, to getting back into top form as his father was offworld training. Having witnessed his young daughter Pan&#x27;s kidnapping, an enraged Gohan is led to the Army&#x27;s hidden base to confront its leaders, finding himself contending with the new androids, Gamma 1 and 2 alongside Piccolo. After Cell Max (a recreation of the original Cell) is awakened prematurely courtesy of a dying Magenta, Gohan, alongside his friends, deal with the monster. Witnessing Cell Max seemingly killing Piccolo, Gohan, very similarly to his awakening against the original Cell as a child, snaps and unleashes a never-before-seen transformation in an explosive rage, referred to as the &quot;Beast&quot; state. Swiftly retaliating and without hesitation, Gohan unleashes his final attack against Cell Max, assisted by Piccolo, killing the abomination and saving the world. After sensing Gohan&#x27;s ki, Goku visits Earth and convinces Gohan, along with Goten and Trunks, to come fight on Beerus&#x27; planet. Gohan spars with Goku, revealing to him his newly acquired Beast form and how he is able to tap into his anger, but subdue it before losing control. This in turn prompts Goku to set up a training match between Gohan and Broly, in hopes that he can help Broly control his own anger, successfully doing so in their fight. Vegeta grows impatient and jumps in to fight, along with Goku, Trunks, and Goten, in a massive saiyan brawl. After they&#x27;re all worn out, they have supper and leave to go back to Earth, where Goku accompanies Gohan and Piccolo to pick Pan up from school.

==Reception==

In 1993, Gohan placed first in a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character popularity poll voted on by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers, and was also voted the third most popular character by fans of the series for the 2004 book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. Due to the popularity of Gohan, other merchandise, such as action figures, video games, and clothing have featured Gohan in Japan and in various countries around the world. C.J. A. Glover of &quot;Moviepilot&quot; ranked Gohan his third favorite comic character, admitting Gohan &quot;has always been somewhat of an idol to me&quot; as he related to bottling up his anger and being a gentle person that, when snapping, &quot;would let loose and it would be hard to bottle it back up again.&quot; In conclusion, Glover wrote that Gohan was definitely &quot;one of my favorite anime and manga characters ever.&quot; Gohan&#x27;s relationship with mentor Piccolo during the Saiyan arc was praised, being seen as &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;culminating in a truly emotional and inspiring moment that one doesn&#x27;t often expect from your average animated series.&quot; Tomoko Hiroki from Bandai Namco considered Gohan her favorite character from the series.
Most of Gohan&#x27;s praise is derived from his role in the Cell arc of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. IGN writer D. F. Smith liked how during the Cell Games, Gohan has more screen time than Goku, and praised his scenes as one of the biggest moments from said story arc. Theron Martin from Anime News Network celebrated Gohan&#x27;s development in the Cell Games as he had grown up and become stronger. The character&#x27;s battles against Cell during the arc and his transformation into a Super Saiyan 2 were positively received as some of the best in the entire series, the fight additionally being praised for its animation. Both Anime Focus and John Begley believed &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; could have ended with Gohan&#x27;s defeat of Cell, the latter reasoning concluding it there would have &quot;provided it a sense of poignancy and closure that retroactively would have provided a greater sense of depth and purpose.&quot; Luke Ryan Baldock of The Hollywood News felt Gohan&#x27;s progression was the focus of the Cell Games and that he had begun to match his father Goku in ability, calling their relationship &quot;a fascinating one to watch unfold.&quot; Reviewer Nick Hartel expressed that the &quot;continuing elevation of Gohan&quot; pleased him and the last episodes of the Cell storyline &quot;properly sees this is paid off from a narrative standpoint.&quot; Reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. wrote that the series split its focus between Goku and Gohan during the start of the series as they grew on their own, finding it to be &quot;an interesting way to handle the flow of story but also important because it shows Gohan&#x27;s growth as a person and warrior.&quot;

Gohan&#x27;s role and character in the latter part of the series was met with more mixed reviews. Reviewer Michael Zupan wrote of his disappointment with the character, &quot;Gohan was once the most promising warrior in the galaxy, with the potential to even best his father, Goku… and this is where he&#x27;s at seven years later? Dressing up in a green dress, black tights and a Lost in Space helmet to put the beat down on robbers?&quot;
Anime Focus found humor in his Great Saiyaman guise and his &quot;clumsy but earnest&quot; relationship with Videl, but thought it &quot;mostly uninspired and draggy and feels very flat after the high flying antics of previous arcs.&quot; Reviewer Brad Stephenson argued that the character growing older and becoming more &quot;emotionally complex&quot; provided &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; &quot;with a true sense of progression and meaning.&quot; While controversial, lighthearted and more casual fans of the show tend to enjoy the Saiyaman saga due to its comedic tone and way of portraying larger than life figures in relatable real life situations. Josh Begley enjoyed Gohan trying to find his place in high school and his role as big brother to Goten, but thought his Great Saiyaman guise was not comedic and became embarrassed on the character&#x27;s behalf. Anime Focus was impressed with his fight against Majin Buu after he was powered up, calling it a &quot;rare chance for him to flex his muscles&quot; by giving Majin Buu &quot;an impressive beatdown&quot;.

Gohan&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; was the subject of negative response. Den of Geek noted his lighthearted self was not fit for Trunks&#x27; dark storyline and heavily contrasted the previous characterizations of Gohan Trunks used to see. In a later review, the same site enjoyed how the anime mocked Gohan&#x27;s heroic persona but had mixed feelings in regards to its handling in gag episode. The site addressed fans&#x27; complaints about how Gohan&#x27;s character was nearly forgotten by the staff members as well as his marriage with Videll. Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again. On the other hand, Leach criticized how &quot;Super&quot; tries to teach &quot;life lessons&quot; to a mature Gohan. The fact that Piccolo calls him &quot;arrogant&quot;, despite Gohan&#x27;s kindness and humility, was seen as a bad plot point by the reviewer. Mark Sammut of &quot;TheGamer&quot; notes that Gohan occasionally performs the dab move (as The Great Saiyaman), decades before it became a popular dance move in American popular culture.

Collider claimed that Gohan was the character with the most character development given in the entire series as the plot of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; primarily focused on his coming-of-age history as he faces enemies despite his young age to the point that Toei almost turned the title of the anime into &quot;Dragon Ball: Gohan&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. However, Gohan was still overshadowed by Goku who still was the main hero in the story arcs even though Gohan was the developed hero. Following Goku&#x27;s death in the Cell Games, Collider notes that the writers appeared to give Gohan his role as the protagonist definitively especially with how he kills Cell and becomes the focus of the anime&#x27;s time-skip opening sequence rather than Goku. However, Gohan being once again replaced by his father as the series&#x27; hero due Toriyama not finding him equal to Goku for the Buu arc disappointed the writer and thus hopes that the upcoming moving &quot;Super Hero&quot; will give him the catharsis he wants as it meant to properly focus on Gohan once again. &quot;Polygon&quot; claimed that Piccolo was the best paternal figure to Gohan and it is further demonstrated in &quot;Super Hero&quot; due to the two sharing emotional scenes to the point the former goes on a quest to train the latter such as taking care of his daughter which Gohan honors in response.

==Merchandise==
Gohan has varied amount of merchandises, ranging from figures, plushies, and keychains. This is something common to see, especially with anime characters. However, Gohan has some unique products. Adidas decided to do a Dragon Ball collaboration, making some special edition shoes for certain characters. While Gohan isn&#x27;t the only character to get a shoe, this is still something pretty unique. But Adidas is not the only company to do a collaboration with Dragon Ball. Swatch has done a collaboration with Dragon Ball. Making specific watches that correlates with specific characters. Giving Gohan a unique watch.

<text>City Lights is an independent bookstore-publisher combination in San Francisco, California, that specializes in world literature, the arts, and progressive politics. It also houses the nonprofit City Lights Foundation, which publishes selected titles related to San Francisco culture. It was founded in 1953 by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Peter D. Martin (who left two years later). Both the store and the publishers became widely known following the obscenity trial of Ferlinghetti for publishing Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s influential collection &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot; (City Lights, 1956). Nancy Peters started working there in 1971 and retired as executive director in 2007. In 2001, City Lights was made an official historic landmark. City Lights is located at 261 Columbus Avenue. While formally located in Chinatown, it self-identifies as part of immediately adjacent North Beach.
==History==

===Founding and early years===
City Lights was the inspiration of Peter D. Martin, who relocated from New York City to San Francisco in the 1940s to teach sociology. He first used &quot;City Lights&quot;, in homage to the Chaplin film, in 1952 as the title of a magazine, publishing early work by such key Bay Area writers as Philip Lamantia, Pauline Kael, Jack Spicer, Robert Duncan, and Ferlinghetti himself, as &quot;Lawrence Ferling&quot;. A year later, Martin used the name to establish the first all-paperback bookstore in the U.S., at the time an audacious idea.

The site was a tiny storefront in the triangular Artigues Building located at 261 Columbus Avenue, near the intersection of Broadway in North Beach. Built on the ruins of a previous building destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake, the building was designed by Oliver Everett in 1907 and named for its owners. City Lights originally shared the building with a number of other shops. It gradually gained more space whenever one of the other shops became vacant, and eventually occupied the entire building.

In 1953, as Ferlinghetti was walking past the Artigues Building, he encountered Martin out front hanging up a sign that announced a &quot;Pocket Book Shop.&quot; He introduced himself as a contributor to Martin&#x27;s magazine &quot;City Lights&quot;, and told him he had always wanted a bookstore. Before long he and Martin agreed to a partnership. Each man invested $500. Soon after they opened, they hired Shig Murao as a clerk. Murao worked without pay for the first few weeks, but eventually became manager of the store and was a key element in creating the unique feel of City Lights. In 1955, Martin sold his share of the business to Ferlinghetti for $1000, moved to New York and started the New Yorker Bookstore which specialized in cinema.

In the late 1960s, Ferlinghetti hired Joseph Wolberg, former philosophy professor at SUNY Buffalo, to manage the bookstore. Wolberg is credited with organizing the once chaotically messy shelves and for convincing a cheap Ferlinghetti to install anti-shoplifting metal detectors. Through his connection to City Lights, Wolberg produced records for Beat poets such as Charles Bukowski and Shel Silverstein. 

The logo for &quot;City Lights Bookstore&quot; is a medieval guild mark, chosen by Ferlinghetti, from Rudolf Koch&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Signs&quot;.

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1970, City Lights hired Paul Yamazaki, an activist who had been jailed during protests for Black studies and Ethnic studies departments at San Francisco State University. Yamazaki would continue working at the bookstore for over fifty years, and in 2023 was awarded the National Book Foundation&#x27;s Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the Literary Community.

In 1971, Ferlinghetti persuaded Nancy Peters – who was working at the Library of Congress – to join in a project with him, after which she began full-time work at City Lights. She said:
In 1984, the business was in a financial crisis and Peters became a co-owner of it. Ferlinghetti credits her for the subsequent survival and growing success of the business. In 1999, with Ferlinghetti, she bought the building they worked in.

===2000s===
In 2001, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors made City Lights an official historic landmark – the first time this had been granted to a business, rather than a building – citing the organization for &quot;playing a seminal role in the literary and cultural development of San Francisco and the nation.&quot; It recognized the bookstore as &quot;a landmark that attracts thousands of book lovers from all over the world because of its strong ambiance of alternative culture and arts&quot;, and it acknowledged City Lights Publishers for its &quot;significant contribution to major developments in post-World War II literature.&quot;
 The building itself, with its clerestory windows and small mezzanine balcony, also qualified as a city landmark because of its &quot;distinctive characteristics typical of small commercial buildings constructed following the 1906 earthquake and fire.&quot; The landmark designation mandates the preservation of certain external features of the building and its immediate surroundings. Peters commented (referring to the effect of dotcom and computer firms), &quot;The old San Francisco is under attack to the point where it&#x27;s disappearing.&quot;

By 2003, the store had 15 employees. Peters estimated that the year&#x27;s profits would be only &quot;maybe a thousand dollars.&quot; In 2007, after 23 years as executive director, she stepped down from the post, which was filled by Elaine Katzenberger; Peters remained on the board of directors. Peters said of her work at City Lights:

===Present===

City Lights sells a curated selection of new books, specializing in literature, cultural studies, world history, and politics. It offers three floors of new-release hardcovers and paperbacks from all major publishers, as well as a large selection of titles from smaller, independent publishers. It hosts weekly events in its City Lights LIVE programming series, which switched to virtual events in 2020 due to the pandemic. City Lights is a member of the American Booksellers Association.

==Publishing==

In 1955, Ferlinghetti launched City Lights Publishers with his own &quot;Pictures of the Gone World&quot;, the first number in the Pocket Poets Series. This was followed in quick succession by &quot;Thirty Spanish Poems of Love and Exile&quot; translated by Kenneth Rexroth and &quot;Poems of Humor &amp; Protest&quot; by Kenneth Patchen, but it was the impact of the fourth volume, &quot;Howl and Other Poems&quot; (1956) by Allen Ginsberg that brought national attention to the author and publisher.

&quot;City Lights Journal&quot; published poems of the Indian Hungry generation writers when the group faced police case in Kolkata. The group got worldwide publicity thereafter.

Apart from Ginsberg&#x27;s seven collections, a number of the early Pocket Poets volumes brought out by Ferlinghetti have attained the status of classics, including &quot;True Minds&quot; by Marie Ponsot (1957), &quot;Here and Now&quot; by Denise Levertov (1958), &quot;Gasoline&quot; (1958) by Gregory Corso, &quot;Selected Poems&quot; by Robert Duncan (1959), &quot;Lunch Poems&quot; (1964) by Frank O&#x27;Hara,&quot; Selected Poems&quot; (1967) by Philip Lamantia, &quot;Poems to Fernando&quot; (1968) by Janine Pommy Vega, &quot;Golden Sardine&quot; (1969) by Bob Kaufman, and &quot;Revolutionary Letters&quot; (1971) by Diane di Prima.

In 1967 the publishing operation moved to 1562 Grant Avenue. Dick McBride ran this part of the business with his brother Bob McBride and Martin Broadley for several years.

In 1971, Nancy Peters joined Ferlinghetti as co-editor and publisher. He praised her as &quot;one of the best literary editors in the country.&quot;. Presently, the publisher is Elaine Katzenberger, who is also the director of the bookstore.

Over the years, the press has published a wide range of poetry and prose, fiction and nonfiction, and works in translation. In addition to books by Beat Generation authors, the press publishes literary work by such authors as Charles Bukowski, Georges Bataille, Rikki Ducornet, Paul Bowles, Sam Shepard, Andrei Voznesensky, Nathaniel Mackey, Alejandro Murguía, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Ernesto Cardenal, Daisy Zamora, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Juan Goytisolo, Anne Waldman, André Breton, Kamau Daáood, Masha Tupitsyn, and Rebecca Brown. In 1965, the press published an anthology of texts by Antonin Artaud, edited by Jack Hirschman.

In 2014, the press published its first New York Times bestselling book, &quot;Rad American Women A-Z&quot;, the press&#x27;s first book for children, by Kate Schatz with illustrations by Miriam Klein Stahl. Since then, other critically acclaimed books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry include &quot;Man Alive&quot; by Thomas Page McBee, &quot;Notes on the Assemblage&quot; by Juan Felipe Herrera (who was U.S. Poet Laureate at the time), &quot;Dated Emcees&quot; by Chinaka Hodge, an anniversary edition of &quot;The Gilda Stories&quot; by Jewelle Gomez, &quot;Incidents of Travel in Poetry&quot; by Frank Lima, &quot;Retablos&quot; by Octavio Solis, &quot;Poso Wells&quot; by Gabriela Alemán, &quot;Under the Dome&quot; by Jean Daive, and &quot;Funeral Diva&quot; by Pamela Sneed, among others. The press has also published two books by Tongo Eisen-Martin, Poet Laureate of San Francisco.

Associated from the outset with radical left-wing politics and issues of social justice, City Lights has in recent years augmented its list of political non-fiction, publishing books by Angela Y. Davis, Noam Chomsky, Michael Parenti, Howard Zinn, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Ward Churchill, Tim Wise, Roy Scranton, John Gibler, Todd Miller, Clarence Lusane, Ralph Nader, Henry A. Giroux, and Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz.

==&quot;Howl&quot;==

Ferlinghetti had heard Ginsberg read &quot;Howl&quot; in 1955 at the Six Gallery; the next day, he offered to publish it along with other shorter poems. William Carlos Williams — who was Ginsberg&#x27;s childhood Pediatrician and himself a future Pocket Poet with a 1957 edition of his early modernist classic, &quot;Kora in Hell&quot; (1920) — was recruited for an introduction, perhaps to lend literary justification to &quot;Howl&quot;&#x27;s depictions of drug use and homosexuality. Prior to publication, Ferlinghetti had asked, and received, assurance from the American Civil Liberties Union that the organization would defend him, should he be prosecuted for obscenity.

Published in November 1956, &quot;Howl&quot; was not long in generating controversy. In March 1957, local Collector of Customs Chester MacPhee seized a shipment from England of the book&#x27;s second printing on grounds of obscenity, but he was compelled to release the books when federal authorities refused to confirm his charge. But the troubles were just beginning, for in June of that year, local police raided City Lights Bookstore and arrested store manager Shigeyoshi Murao on the charge of offering an obscene book for sale. Ferlinghetti, then in Big Sur, turned himself in on his return to San Francisco. Both faced a possible $500 fine and a 6-month sentence. (Ginsberg was in Tangiers at the time, and not charged.) The ACLU posted bail, assigned defense counsel Albert Bendich to the case, and secured the pro bono services of famous criminal defense lawyer J. W. Ehrlich.

The municipal court trial, presided over by Judge Clayton W. Horn, ran from August 16 to September 3, 1957. The charges against Murao were dismissed since it couldn&#x27;t be proved that he knew what was in the book. Then, during the trial of Ferlinghetti, respected writers and professors testified for the defense. Judge Horn rendered his precedent-setting verdict, declaring that &quot;Howl&quot; was not obscene and that a book with &quot;the slightest redeeming social importance&quot; merits First Amendment protection. Horn&#x27;s decision established the precedent that paved the way for the publication of such hitherto banned books as D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; and Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. The media attention resulting from the trial stimulated national interest, and, by 1958, there were 20,000 copies in print. Today there are over a million. Ginsberg continued to publish his major books of poetry with the press for the next 25 years. Even after the publication by Harper &amp; Row of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; in 1980, he would continue his warm association with City Lights, which served as his local base of operations, for the rest of his life.

<text>Grant Green (June 6, 1935 – January 31, 1979) was an American jazz guitarist and composer.

Recording prolifically for Blue Note Records as both leader and sideman, Green performed in the hard bop, soul jazz, bebop, and Latin-tinged idioms throughout his career. Critic Michael Erlewine wrote, &quot;A severely underrated player during his lifetime, Grant Green is one of the great unsung heroes of jazz guitar ... Green&#x27;s playing is immediately recognizable – perhaps more than any other guitarist.&quot; Critic Dave Hunter described his sound as &quot;lithe, loose, slightly bluesy and righteously groovy&quot;.

He often performed in an organ trio, a small group featuring a Hammond organ and drummer. Apart from fellow guitarist Charlie Christian, Green&#x27;s primary influences were saxophonists, particularly Charlie Parker, and his approach was almost exclusively linear rather than chordal. He rarely played rhythm guitar except as a sideman on albums led by other musicians.

The simplicity and immediacy of Green&#x27;s playing, which tended to avoid chromaticism, derived from his early work playing rhythm and blues and, although he achieved a synthesis of this style with bop, he was a skilled blues and funk guitarist and returned to this style in his later career.

== Biography ==
Grant Green was born on June 6, 1935, in St. Louis, Missouri to John and Martha Green. At various times his father was a laborer and a Saint Louis policeman. Grant began studying guitar while he was in primary school. He received early instruction in guitar playing from his father, who played blues and folk music. Grant studied for a year with Forrest Alcorn, but he was mostly self-taught, learning from listening to records.

Grant Green first performed in a professional setting at the age of 13 as a member of a gospel music ensemble. Through his 20s, he was a member of jazz and R&amp;B bands. His influences were Charlie Christian, Charlie Parker, Lester Young, and Jimmy Raney. Green&#x27;s style mimicked that of a saxophonist playing single note rather than chords. His first recordings were at the age of 24, in St. Louis with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest for the United label, where Green played alongside drummer Elvin Jones. Green recorded with Jones for several albums in the mid-1960s. In 1959, Lou Donaldson discovered Green playing in a bar in St. Louis and hired him for his touring band. Green moved to New York City during 1959–60.

Donaldson introduced Green to Alfred Lion of Blue Note Records. From 1961–1965 he was Blue Note&#x27;s house guitarist. Rather than using Green as a sideman, as was the Blue Note practice, Lion arranged for him to record as a group leader. However due to Green&#x27;s lack of confidence, the initial recording session was only released in 2001 as &quot;First Session&quot;.

Despite his first session being shelved, Green&#x27;s recording relationship with Blue Note lasted with a few exceptions, throughout the 1960s. From 1961 to 1965, Green made more appearances on Blue Note albums as leader or sideman than anyone else. His first album as a leader was &quot;Grant&#x27;s First Stand&quot; followed in the same year by &quot;Green Street&quot; and &quot;Grantstand&quot;. He was named Best New Star in the &quot;Down Beat&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll, in 1962. He often provided support to others musicians on Blue Note, including saxophonists Hank Mobley, Ike Quebec, Stanley Turrentine, and organist Larry Young.

&quot;Sunday Mornin&#x27; &quot;, &quot;The Latin Bit&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; the Spirit&quot; are all concept albums, each taking a musical theme or style: gospel, Latin and spirituals respectively. Grant carried off his more commercial dates with artistic success during this period: &quot;Idle Moments&quot; (1963), featuring Joe Henderson and Bobby Hutcherson and &quot;Solid&quot; (1964), are described by jazz critics as two of Green&#x27;s best recordings.

Many of Green&#x27;s recordings were not released during his lifetime. These include several albums with pianist Sonny Clark recorded in 1961–1962 included in &quot;The Complete Grant Green &amp; Sonny Clark&quot; released by Mosaic in 1997, and two albums from 1964 (&quot;Matador&quot; and &quot;Solid&quot;) that featured McCoy Tyner and Elvin Jones from the John Coltrane Quartet. In 1966 Green left Blue Note and recorded for other labels including Verve. From 1967 to 1969 he was inactive due to personal problems and the effects of heroin addiction. In 1969 he returned to Blue Note but played mostly in R&amp;B settings. His recordings from that period include the commercially successful &quot;Green Is Beautiful&quot; and the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Final Comedown&quot;.

For most of 1978 Grant was in the hospital and against the advice of doctors, went back on the road to earn money. While in New York City to play an engagement at George Benson&#x27;s Breezin&#x27; Lounge, he collapsed in his car of a heart attack and died on January 31, 1979. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery in his hometown of St. Louis and was survived by six children, including his son Grant Green Jr., who is also a guitarist.

== Equipment ==
Green used a Gibson ES-330, then a Gibson L7 with a Gibson McCarty pickguard/pickup, an Epiphone Emperor (with the same pickup), and finally had a custom-built D&#x27;Aquisto. According to his protégé and fellow guitarist Benson, Grant achieved his tone by turning off the bass and treble settings of his amplifier as well as maximizing the midrange. That way he could get his signature punchy, biting tone.

<text>Limehouse is a National Rail and connected Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Limehouse, London, England. It is served by regional services operated by c2c to and from Fenchurch Street and by light metro services provided by the DLR to and from Tower Gateway or Bank. On the main line, Limehouse is located from Fenchurch Street and the following station is West Ham; on the DLR it is between Shadwell and Westferry in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station was opened by the Commercial Railway (later the London and Blackwall Railway) in 1840 with the name Stepney. At that time, the Commercial Railway had a separate station named Limehouse one stop to the east. Stepney was renamed Stepney East in 1923, and in 1926 the other Limehouse station was closed. Stepney East adopted the current Limehouse name in 1987, just before the DLR opened.

==History==

===Early history (1840–1866)===
The station was opened on 6 July 1840 by the Commercial Railway, located in the parish of Stepney within the hamlet of Ratcliff. It was named Stepney, lying between Shadwell and a separate station called Limehouse, located within the Limehouse parish. The initial train service operated between a temporary terminus at Minories and Blackwall until 2 August 1841 when Fenchurch Street opened; the Commercial Railway was then renamed the London and Blackwall Railway (LBR). The service was a rope-powered operation and it was not until 15 February 1849 that steam operation commenced.

On 28 September 1850 an extension was opened from Stepney to Bow, to join the LBR with the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR). Increasing congestion on the approaches to Fenchurch Street saw a third line proposed between Fenchurch Street and a junction at George Street (now called Boulcott Street). Discussions about a replacement started in 1853 but it was not until 1 April 1856 that plans were agreed by the LBR board.
In the meantime the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) was opened in 1854 operating trains via Stratford railway station to Fenchurch Street.
The replacement (existing) station was constructed with a set of platforms (the present-day platforms 1 and 2) to serve the Bow route (as it was then) whilst two further platforms were constructed for the Blackwall line (the Docklands Light Railway platforms occupy this site). It opened on 30 March 1856.

In 1858 LTSR trains started operating on the direct route from Barking rather than via the congested Stratford route. Twenty people were injured in a minor collision at the station on 22 November 1861. A Board of Trade report found a signaller&#x27;s error the primary cause of the incident.

===Great Eastern Railway ownership (1866–1922)===
In 1866 the Great Eastern Railway (GER) took over the LBR on a long-lease and instigated a series of repairs and in 1869 provided improved signalling arrangements with a new signal box and interlocked signals and block working between adjacent signal boxes.

On 9 April 1871 a train from Bow ran through a signal and hit a Blackwall to Fenchurch Street train with the last coach being knocked off the viaduct and landing on a building below. A further accident in 1879 saw the Board of Trade inspector recommend the re-siting of the signal box which was duly provided in 1880.
With a frequent train service however Stepney was again the site of an accident in 1874 with 106 injuries, in 1889 where a LTSR locomotive derailed, and in 1892 where another LTSR locomotive was derailed but this time was hit by a GER locomotive killing the LTSR driver.

An improved building was provided on the down Bow platform in 1894. In 1895 the fourth line towards Fenchurch Street was opened which helped reduce the number of conflicting moves between trains and thus the risk of accidents. The GER further improved the station in 1900.

The LTSR became part of the Midland Railway in 1912.

===London &amp; North Eastern Railway ownership (1923–1947)===

On 1 January 1923 the Midland Railway became part of the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) which took over operation of the services to Southend and Tilbury.

The GER became part of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway on this date and the station was renamed Stepney East on 1 July 1923 to avoid confusion with the Stepney station in Yorkshire.

The LBR platforms were closed on 3 May 1926 as passenger services were withdrawn and all services were routed via the Bow platforms. A few goods trains used the Blackwall route but the LBR platforms were demolished in circa 1936 and the junction simplified. The signalling was improved at this time as part of a major re-signalling with colour light signals from Fenchurch Street to Gas Factory Junction (east of Stepney).

===Railway nationalisation (1948–1994)===
On 20 February 1949 the whole LTS line was transferred to the Eastern Region, yet despite the organisational changes, the old LTSR still was a distinctive system operated by former LTS and LMS locomotives until electrification.

The route to Stratford via Bow Road was electrified in 1949 and it was at that time that the former GER suburban services ceased operating leaving Stepney East served only by trains to the former LTSR destinations. No public electric trains ran however until the old LTSR system was electrified in 1961–62 with full electric services commencing on 17 June 1962.

The junction to the Blackwall line was removed in 1952 although a siding remained on the viaduct (accessible from the Blackwall end) for scrap metal traffic from Regent Dock which finished in the old Blackwall platforms.

Between 1982 and 1992 the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail&#x27;s three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation.

The station&#x27;s roof and canopy were destroyed during the Great storm of 1987.

===Docklands Light Railway opens (1987)===

On 31 August 1987 the Docklands Light Railway, which operated over the old LBR line, commenced operations, with new platforms (platforms 3 and 4) built on the site of the old LBR platforms; the station had been renamed Limehouse on 11 May that year.

The platforms were extended in 1991 to accommodate the DLR&#x27;s new and longer two-carriage trains.
===The privatisation era (1994–present)===

In April 1994 Railtrack became responsible for the maintenance of the infrastructure at Limehouse station. Railtrack was succeeded by Network Rail in 2002.

In May 1996 the franchise for the London, Tilbury and Southend line was awarded to Prism Rail by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising for a 15-year period with an average annual subsidy of £18.4 million. It began operating as LTS Rail on 26 May 1996. Prism was bought out by National Express who named the franchise c2c in 2003 and continue to operate the station.

Since the opening of the DLR, Limehouse has become a well-used interchange for Essex and east London commuters who work in the Canary Wharf area, but the two viaducts remained separate, resulting in an awkward interchange between the DLR platforms and the National Rail platforms, as passengers had to pass down and then up flights of stairs. To remedy this, at least in part, a bridge was built to connect the westbound (London-bound) main line platform with the adjacent eastbound (Canary Wharf-bound) DLR platform. It was originally due for completion by the end of 2008, but was finally opened in November 2009. At the same time as the bridge was being built, other improvements were made, including readying the station for three-carriage operations on the DLR and the construction of an additional eastern entrance, with lifts and stairways for platform access.

==Limehouse Curve==

There was also a rail link on a curved viaduct to the east of the station known as the Limehouse Curve. This opened on 5 April 1880 and was generally used for goods trains heading towards London&#x27;s docks. There was a short-lived passenger train service between Blackwall and Palace Gates (via Stratford and Seven Sisters) which operated from 1 September 1880 until 1 March 1881. Some special excursion trains also used the curve about this time running from Blackwall to Southend and Southminster on summer Sundays in 1890 and 1891.

The Limehouse Curve was last used on 5 November 1962; on 10 May 1963 it was officially abandoned.

==Design==
Limehouse station is elevated on a pair of diverging viaducts, each carrying a pair of platforms – one pair for National Rail trains and one for the Docklands Light Railway. The National Rail platforms have one entrance accessed via a stairwell at the western end, while the DLR platforms have entrances at both the western and eastern ends, each equipped with stairwells and lifts. The westbound main line platform is connected to the eastbound DLR platform by a walkway bridge.
The station holds Secure Stations Scheme accreditation, and bicycle racks are provided underneath the DLR platforms by the western entrance. The ticket office is located within the station building under the main line platforms, and is managed by c2c; tickets can be retailed for National Rail services, the DLR and on Oyster card. Additional automatic ticket machines for DLR and Oyster cards are located under the DLR platforms at the foot of the stairways. There are automatic ticket barriers to the National Rail platforms, but not the DLR, meaning the bridge between the two sets of platforms has its own set of barriers.

==Services==
===National Rail===

<text>Westferry is a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station in Limehouse in London, England. It is located in Travelcard Zone 2. To the west is Limehouse station, whilst to the east the DLR splits, with one branch going to Poplar station and the other to West India Quay station.

==Location==

The DLR station was built midway between the site of the old Limehouse and West India Docks stations on the disused London and Blackwall Railway. Limehouse Police Station is nearby, as is St Anne&#x27;s Church, built by Nicholas Hawksmoor and boasting London&#x27;s tallest church clock tower. The station is also close to Westferry Circus and Canary Wharf Pier.

== Etymology ==
Westferry station is in Limehouse and given its proximity to the former Limehouse station on the London &amp; Blackwall Railway, could have been given this name, but instead Stepney East was renamed Limehouse and the DLR station there given that name. West India Quay was reserved for the station at the other end of West India Dock, so there was no obvious choice.

There is no place called Westferry; the name is derived from the nearby Westferry Road. Nor was there ever a west ferry. There was a passenger ferry at the southern tip of the Isle of Dogs run by the Greenwich watermen. It was accessed by two roads, East Ferry Road (also known locally as Farm Road) and Westferry Road, built in 1812 when a horse ferry was introduced alongside the passenger ferry. The two roads still exist, running down the centre and west side of the Isle of Dogs respectively. However, the road names refer to an ancient service at the far end of the Isle of Dogs from the station.

==Services==
The typical off-peak service in trains per hour from Westferry is:
* 6 tph to Tower Gateway
* 18 tph to Bank
* 6 tph to Beckton
* 6 tph to 
* 12 tph to via Canary Wharf

Additional services call at the station during the peak hours, increasing the total service to up to 30 tph in each direction.


==Connections==
London Buses routes 135, 277, D3, D7 and night routes N277 and N550 serve the station.

<doc id="241920" wikidata="Q2355124" url="?curid=241920" title="Edward German">
<text>Sir Edward German (born German Edward Jones; 17 February 1862 – 11 November 1936) was an English musician and composer of Welsh descent, best remembered for his extensive output of incidental music for the stage and as a successor to Arthur Sullivan in the field of English comic opera. Some of his light operas, especially &quot;Merrie England&quot;, are still performed.

As a youth, German played the violin and led the town orchestra of Whitchurch, Shropshire. He also began to compose music. While performing and teaching violin at the Royal Academy of Music, German began to build a career as a composer in the mid-1880s, writing serious music as well as light opera. In 1888, he became music director of the Globe Theatre in London. He provided popular incidental music for many productions at the Globe and other London theatres, including &quot;Richard III&quot; (1889), &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1892) and &quot;Nell Gwynn&quot; (1900). He also wrote symphonies, orchestral suites, symphonic poems and other works. He also wrote a considerable body of songs, piano music, and symphonic suites and other concert music, of which his &quot;Welsh Rhapsody&quot; (1904) is perhaps best known.

German was engaged to finish &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot; after the death of Arthur Sullivan in 1900, the success of which led to more comic operas, including &quot;Merrie England&quot; (1902) and &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1907). He also wrote the &quot;Just So Song Book&quot; in 1903 to Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s texts and continued to write orchestral music. German wrote little new music of his own after 1912, but he continued to conduct until 1928, the year in which he was knighted.

== Life and career ==
German was born German Edward Jones in Whitchurch, Shropshire, the second of five children and the elder of two sons of John David Jones, a liquor merchant, brewer, church organist and lay preacher at the local Congregational chapel, and Elizabeth (Betsy) Cox (died 1901), a teacher of Bible classes for young women. His first name was an anglicised form of the Welsh name &quot;Garmon.&quot; His parents called him Jim. He began to study piano and organ with his father at the age of five. At the age of six, he formed a boys&#x27; concert band to perform locally, teaching himself the violin, composition, and music arrangement in the process. He later sang alto in the church choir and participated in family entertainments above his uncle&#x27;s grocery shop, often playing piano duets and performing comic sketches with his elder sister, Ruth, who died when he was 15. He also wrote comic poems. His younger sisters were named Mabel and Rachel.

In his mid-teens, German&#x27;s parents attempted to apprentice him to a shipbuilding firm, as they believed their son had an aptitude for engineering. His studies at a boarding-school in Chester had been delayed by a serious illness, however, and so he was turned away as too old to begin an apprenticeship. In his teens he formed a second band, a quintette, including himself on the violin, his sister on the pianoforte or the bass, and three friends of the family. He prepared the orchestrations for this band. He also led the town orchestra, did some amateur acting, and sang comic songs in local village halls.

=== The Royal Academy ===
At the age of 18, he studied privately with Walter Cecil Hay, the conductor of the Whitchurch choral society and director of music at St Chad&#x27;s, Shrewsbury. German entered the Royal Academy of Music, where he eventually changed his name to J. E. German (and later simply Edward German) to avoid confusion with another student named Edward Jones. He continued his studies of violin and organ, also beginning a more formal study of composition under Ebenezer Prout. Many of German&#x27;s student works were played at Academy concerts.

In 1884, the Academy appointed German a sub-professor of the violin. During his time as an instructor, he was well regarded and won several medals and prizes, such as the Tubbs Bow for his skill with the violin. In 1885, he won the Charles Lucas Medal for his &quot;Te Deum&quot; for soloists, choir and organ, leading him to change his focus from violin to composition. He soon wrote a light opera, &quot;The Two Poets&quot; (for four soloists and piano), in 1886, which was produced at the Academy and then performed at St. George&#x27;s Hall. In 1887, his first symphony, in E Minor, was also performed at the Academy. In 1890 he conducted a revised version of this symphony at the Crystal Palace, while &quot;The Two Poets&quot; toured successfully in England.

During his time at the Royal Academy, German taught at Wimbledon School and played the violin in theatre orchestras, including the Savoy Theatre. He visited Germany in 1886 and 1888–89 and was impressed by its opera, particularly at Bayreuth. His circle of close friends at the Academy included Dora Bright and Ethel Mary Boyce from Chertsey, Surrey. He and Boyce became engaged. She was also a promising composition student and won the Lady Goldsmid scholarship in 1885, the Sterndale Bennett Prize in 1886 and the Charles Lucas Medal in 1889. Although the engagement was broken off, they remained friends. German never married.

=== Plays and orchestral music ===
After leaving the Academy, German continued to teach at Wimbledon School and to play the violin in orchestras at various London theatres, including the Savoy. In 1888, an introduction by conductor Alberto Randegger to theatre manager Richard Mansfield led to German&#x27;s appointment as conductor and musical director at the Globe Theatre in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing incidental music for the theatre&#x27;s lavish productions, starting with &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1889. This music was well received (&quot;The Times&quot; called for a concert suite to be arranged), and the overture soon became popular in concert halls. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of Henry Irving&#x27;s version of &quot;Henry VIII&quot; at the Lyceum Theatre, London, where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play&#x27;s score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included Henry Arthur Jones&#x27;s &quot;The Tempter&quot; in 1893, Johnston Forbes-Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Lyceum in 1895, Herbert Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s productions of &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1896) and &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot; (1898), and Anthony Hope&#x27;s &quot;English Nell&quot; (later known as &quot;Nell Gwynn&quot;) in 1900, starring Marie Tempest.

At the same time, German was writing music for the concert hall, sometimes adapting music from his theatrical scores. His &quot;Gipsy Suite&quot; met with success similar to that of his overture to &quot;Richard III&quot; and his popular &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;Nell Gwynn&quot; dances. All were written in &quot;a distinctive, if limited, &#x27;olde English&#x27; manner, a species of musical mock Tudor with which German came to be particularly associated.&quot; He also wrote a number of successful drawing-room songs and solo piano pieces during this time. The success of German&#x27;s theatrical and concert hall music led to his receiving commissions from orchestral music festivals, including his second symphony for the Norwich Festival in 1893. The young critic George Bernard Shaw complained that German&#x27;s symphonies were limited by the composer&#x27;s indulgence in a theatricality out of place in symphonic writing. German was thin-skinned, and after receiving this criticism, he wrote no more symphonies. German tried to avoid this charge in the future by characterising his large-scale four-movement works as &quot;symphonic suites&quot;. Successful orchestral works included suites for the Leeds Festival in 1895 and &quot;The Seasons&quot; for Norwich in 1899, and a symphonic poem, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, at Birmingham in 1897, conducted by Hans Richter. He had planned a violin concerto for the 1901 Leeds Festival, but this was never completed, as German instead turned to light opera. In 1902, he produced a Rhapsody on March Themes for the Brighton Festival.

=== Comic operas ===
Though German had little experience with opera or choral music, Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte invited him to finish Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot; for the Savoy Theatre after Sullivan&#x27;s death in 1900. He accepted, giving up his violin concerto commission for the Leeds Festival to meet the deadlines. The success of his score for the opera (which was performed into the 1920s) opened up a new career for him. His next comic opera, in 1902, was &quot;Merrie England&quot;, with Basil Hood, the librettist for &quot;The Emerald Isle&quot;. This was perhaps German&#x27;s greatest success, and its dance music was popular separately. It was revived frequently, becoming a light-opera standard in Britain, while several of its songs, including &quot;The English Rose&quot;, &quot;O Peaceful England&quot; and &quot;The Yeomen of England&quot;, remained popular until the middle of the 20th century. &quot;Merrie England&quot; has been so frequently chosen by amateur groups in England that it probably has been performed more often than any other British opera or operetta written in the 20th century.
After this, German and Hood collaborated again in 1903 to write &quot;A Princess of Kensington&quot;. This opera was unsuccessful, although it toured briefly and had a New York production. German turned to other endeavours, composing music to Rudyard Kipling texts, including the twelve songs in the &quot;Just So Song Book&quot; in 1903. He also received a steady flow of orchestral commissions, leading to works such as his &quot;Welsh Rhapsody&quot; for the Cardiff Festival in 1904, featuring as its climax &quot;Men of Harlech&quot;.

German returned to writing comic operas, achieving another success with &quot;Tom Jones&quot; for the Apollo Theatre in 1907, produced by Robert Courtneidge for the Fielding bicentenary. The score is one of German&#x27;s finest works. It received a production in New York, with German conducting, and was performed for decades, spawning separate performances of its dance music. He next collaborated with W. S. Gilbert on his final (and unsuccessful) opera, &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot;, at the Savoy in 1909. With German&#x27;s agreement, Gilbert cast his protege, Nancy McIntosh, as the Fairy Queen, Selene. Critics found her performance weak. Shortly after the opening, the producer C. H. Workman, acting at the request of the syndicate he had gathered, replaced McIntosh with Amy Evans and asked for restoration of a song that Gilbert had cut during rehearsals. Gilbert was outraged and threatened to sue, demanding that German join him. This placed German in a distressing position, and the composer, who habitually preferred to avoid legal battles, declined. In maintaining the Savoy tradition of comic opera, German was composing a style of piece for which public taste had dwindled as fashions in musical theatre had changed with the new century.

=== Later years ===
In the wake of the failure of &quot;Fallen Fairies&quot; and his unhappy experience with it, German effectively ended his career as a composer of new works, only returning to composition on a few rare occasions. In 1911 he became the first composer to write music for a British film; he was commissioned for 50 guineas to write 16 bars of music for the coronation scene in the film &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. The same year, he composed his march and hymn for the coronation of King George V.
Among the few works of his later years was the &quot;Theme and Six Diversions&quot; in 1919, and his final major work, the Othello-inspired tone poem &quot;The Willow Song&quot; in 1922. After that, German all but ceased composing. Correspondence shows that he felt uncomfortable with the changing musical styles, such as jazz and modernist classical music. Like Sullivan before him, he regretted that his popularity stemmed mostly from his comic operas. However, German was a perfectionist and continually revised his works and produced new arrangements for publication. He also recorded some of them and encouraged their production and broadcast on the radio.

German lived, from 1886, in Hall Road, Maida Vale, near Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, London, where he was an avid enthusiast of that game. He lived a quiet life, enjoying walking, cycling and fishing, though he often attended the theatre. He developed a strong friendship with Sir Edward Elgar. German was injured in a road accident during World War I, but continued to be a highly sought-after conductor, accepting many conducting engagements, until he suffered an eye condition that left him blind in his right eye in 1928. He was the first British conductor invited by Dan Godfrey to conduct his own music at Bournemouth. Beginning in 1916, he was also one of the first composers to conduct his own music for recording, producing full renderings of &quot;Merrie England&quot; and &quot;Theme and Six Diversions&quot;.

German was knighted in 1928, when the respect in which he was held by fellow musicians was shown by the number of eminent musicians who attended the celebratory dinner, including Elgar, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Sir Hugh Allen, Sir Landon Ronald, and Lord Berners. In 1934 German received the Royal Philharmonic Society&#x27;s highest honour, its gold medal, presented by Sir Thomas Beecham at an RPS concert. He was elected an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1936, and he was a leader of the Performing Rights Society, which fought for composers&#x27; rights to fair compensation for the performances of their works.

German died of prostate cancer at his Maida Vale home, aged 74. He was cremated at Golders Green, and his ashes are interred in the Whitchurch cemetery. He left an estate valued at £56,191.

== Legacy ==
German lived long enough to witness the beginning of a decline in the popularity of his orchestral works. A note found after his death bears this poignant message: &quot;I die a disappointed man because my serious orchestral works have not been recognised&quot;. However, his best-known orchestral pieces continued to see occasional performances, and his light operas &quot;Merrie England&quot; and &quot;Tom Jones&quot; were kept alive by the productions of amateur companies. Beecham recorded his &quot;Gipsy Suite&quot; in 1956. A recording of his &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Theme and Six Diversions&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot; was released by Naxos in 1994, conducted by Andrew Penny. The first complete professional recording of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; followed in 2009. Dutton Epoch released a selection of German&#x27;s music, including his Symphony No. 2, in 2007, and a recording of some of his incidental music for plays, together with two marches and a hymn in 2012.

The music scholar David Russell Hulme wrote of German that French influences are clearly apparent in his music &quot;and there are even occasional reminders of Tchaikovsky, but paradoxically he was, like Elgar, a stylistic cosmopolitan who wrote music that is quintessentially English.&quot; Hulme also observes that though he is seen as Sullivan&#x27;s successor, German&#x27;s music is quite different in style, and his lyric ballads especially show &quot;a romantic warmth that struck a new note in British operetta&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; argued that German was so frequently spoken of as Sullivan&#x27;s successor that his contemporaries failed to notice that he was &quot;an artist of genius&quot; in his own right. Many of German&#x27;s colleagues in the musical establishment did, however, find his work to be of the highest quality, including Elgar and Sir John Barbirolli. Hulme writes that &quot;German&#x27;s orchestral music certainly does not deserve the neglect it has suffered, for it still has much to offer modern audiences. Beautifully crafted, colourful and vital, its pleasing and distinctive personality is still capable of inspiring the kind of affectionate regard it once so readily kindled.&quot;

German&#x27;s music often reflected a romanticised Shakespearian or semi-mythical English merry-making past. This appealed to contemporary taste, as his &quot;Three Dances from &#x27;Henry VIII″&quot; (1892) was the most frequently performed English orchestral work in the first decade of The Proms, with well over 30 performances between 1895 and 1905, and his &quot;Three Dances from &#x27;As You Like It″&quot; (1896) were similarly popular.

== Edward German Festival ==
The first Edward German Festival was held in 2006 in German&#x27;s birth town, Whitchurch, Shropshire. Events included performances by festival patron and cellist, Julian Lloyd Webber and a concert version of German&#x27;s best-known work, &quot;Merrie England&quot;. Another festival was held on 23–28 April 2009, sponsored by the Friends of Whitchurch Heritage. This programme included a concert version of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (for which a new recording was released by Naxos in 2009) and a school adaptation of &quot;Merrie England&quot;. Other events featured clarinettist Emma Johnson, German scholar David Russell Hulme and the Hallé Orchestra.

<text>Clyde Cyril Best (born 24 February 1951) is a Bermudian former football player. He was one of the first black players in First Division football in England, scoring 47 goals as a striker for West Ham United between 1968 and 1976.

==Early and personal life==
Best moved from Bermuda to England at the age of 17, to play for West Ham United. Upon his arrival he was looked after by club captain Bobby Moore. He has credited Moore and fellow West Ham players Harry Redknapp and Billy Bonds with helping him deal with racist abuse.

==Playing career==
As one of England&#x27;s first black footballers, Best was regularly targeted with racist chanting from the terraces, but eventually became a fan favourite at Upton Park. He was a strong, powerful player with the skills of the traditional English centre forward, tough to dispossess when he had the ball and good in the air. He made his debut for West Ham United in a 1–1 home draw against Arsenal on 25 August 1969 at the age of 18. His first goal for the Hammers came during League Cup competition, in a 4–2 win against Halifax Town, on 3 September 1969. In 1973 Best deputised for an injured Bobby Ferguson in goal against Leeds United. Best played 218 games and registered 58 goals for West Ham over 7 seasons between August 1969 and January 1976.

Best also played in the Dutch Eredivisie for Feyenoord where he was generally viewed as a failure, scoring only 3 goals in 23 matches, and in the United States and Canada for Tampa Bay Rowdies, Toronto Blizzard and Portland Timbers of the North American Soccer League. While playing for Tampa Bay in Soccer Bowl &#x27;75, he scored an 88th-minute goal to secure the Rowdies&#x27; first NASL championship in a 2–0 victory over Portland Timbers. The following spring he led the Rowdies to the 1976 indoor title and was named tournament MVP. He was the Rowdies leading scorer for the brief 1976 indoor season with 11 goals, 5 assists for 27 points.

==Managerial career==
Best was an assistant coach for the San Diego Sockers for a brief period in the early 1990s. Best coached the Bermuda national team from 1997 to 1999.

==Later life==
After his coaching career finished he retired back to Bermuda.

==Honours==
Best was inducted into the Bermuda National Sports Hall of Fame in 2004. He was awarded an MBE in the 2006 New Year Honours list for services to football and the community in Bermuda.

<doc id="241926" wikidata="Q179670" url="?curid=241926" title="Battle of Gaugamela">
<text>The Battle of Gaugamela ( ; ), also called the Battle of Arbela (), took place in 331 BC between the forces of the Army of Macedon under Alexander the Great and the Persian Army under King Darius III. It was the second and final battle between the two kings, and is considered to be the final blow to the Achaemenid Empire, resulting in its complete conquest by Alexander.

The fighting took place in Gaugamela, a village on the banks of the river Bumodus, north of Arbela (modern-day Erbil, in Iraqi Kurdistan). Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Army of Macedon emerged victorious due to the employment of superior tactics and the clever usage of light infantry forces. It was a decisive victory for the League of Corinth, and it led to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire and of Darius III.

== Background ==
In November 333 BC, King Darius III had lost the Battle of Issus to Alexander the Great, which resulted in the subsequent capture of his wife, his mother and his two daughters, Stateira II and Drypetis. Alexander&#x27;s victory at Issus had also given him complete control of southern Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). After the battle, King Darius retreated to Babylon where he regrouped with his remaining army that was there, on-site from a previous battle.

Alexander fought at the Siege of Tyre (332 BC), which lasted from January to July, and the victory resulted in his control of the Levant. Alexander then again fought at the Siege of Gaza. Persian troop counts in Egypt were diminished due to many soldiers being removed to support the Battle of Issus and dying there. As a result, the Persian satrap of Egypt, Mazaces, peacefully surrendered to Alexander upon his arrival.

=== Negotiations between Darius and Alexander ===
Darius tried to dissuade Alexander from further attacks on his empire by diplomacy. Nawotka writes that &quot;[c]onflicting reports of ancient authors make the reconstruction of peace negotiations hypothetical.&quot; Ancient historians provide different accounts of his negotiations with Alexander, which can be separated into three negotiation attempts. Darius reportedly initially requested peace and the safe return of his family, beginning with an offer to pay 10,000 talents as ransom, then offering to cede land in Asia Minor west of the Halys river, and eventually offering to recognize Alexander as a co-equal status as monarch. Alexander rejected all of these offers.

Historians Justin, Arrian and Curtius Rufus, writing in the 1st and 2nd centuries, say that Darius had sent a letter to Alexander after the Battle of Issus. The letter demanded that Alexander withdraw from Asia as well as release all of his prisoners. According to Curtius and Justin, Darius offered a ransom for his prisoners, although Arrian does not mention a ransom. Curtius describes the tone of the letter as offensive, and Alexander refused his demands.

A second negotiation attempt took place after the capture of Tyre. Darius offered Alexander marriage with his daughter Stateira II, as well as all the territory west of the Halys river. Justin is less specific, and does not mention a specific daughter, and only speaks of a portion of Darius&#x27; kingdom. Diodorus Siculus (1st century Greek historian) likewise mentions the offer of all territory west of the Halys river, a treaty of friendship and a large ransom for Darius&#x27; captives. Diodorus is the only ancient historian who mentions the fact that Alexander concealed this letter and presented his friends with a forged one that was favorable to his own interests. Again, Alexander refused Darius&#x27; offers.

Darius began preparations for another battle with Alexander after the failure of the second negotiation attempt. Nevertheless, he made a third and final effort to negotiate with Alexander after Alexander had departed from Egypt. Darius&#x27; third offer was much more generous. He praised Alexander for the treatment of his mother Sisygambis, offered him all territory west of the Euphrates, co-rulership of the Achaemenid Empire, the hand of one of his daughters and 30,000 talents of silver. In the account of Diodorus, Alexander explicitly deliberated this offer with his friends. Parmenion was the only one who spoke up, saying, &quot;If I were Alexander, I should accept what was offered and make a treaty.&quot; Alexander reportedly replied, &quot;So should I, if I were Parmenion.&quot; Alexander, in the end, refused the offer of Darius, and insisted that there could be only one king of Asia. He called on Darius to surrender to him or to meet him in battle in order to decide who would be the sole king of Asia.

The descriptions given by other historians of the third negotiation attempt are similar to the account of Diodorus, but differ in details. Diodorus, Curtius and Arrian write that an embassy was sent instead of a letter, which is also claimed by Justin and Plutarch (1st century). Plutarch and Arrian mention the ransom offered for the prisoners was 10,000 talents, but Diodorus, Curtius and Justin had given the figure of 30,000. Arrian writes that Darius&#x27; third attempt took place during the Siege of Tyre, but the other historians place the second negotiation attempt at that time. In spite of everything, with the failure of his negotiation attempts, Darius had now decided to prepare for another battle with Alexander.

== Prelude ==
In the late spring or early summer of 331 BC, Alexander headed from Egypt, northeast through Syria, toward the Tigris river. In July or August, Alexander reached Thapsacus, on the Euphrates river. Arrian relates that Darius had ordered Mazaeus to guard the crossing of the Euphrates near Thapsacus with a force of 3,000 cavalry, and that he fled when Alexander&#x27;s army approached to cross the river. Alexander arrived at the Tigris in late September.

=== Alexander&#x27;s march through Mesopotamia ===

Alexander crossed the Euphrates in the summer of 331 BC. From there, he followed a northern route instead of a direct southeastern route to Babylon. While doing so he had the Euphrates and the mountains of Armenia on his left. The northern route made it easier to forage for supplies and his troops would not suffer the extreme heat of the direct route. Captured Persian scouts reported to the Macedonians that Darius had encamped past the Tigris river. Alexander found the Tigris undefended and succeeded in crossing it with great difficulty.

By contrast, Diodorus mentions that Mazaeus was only supposed to prevent Alexander from crossing the Tigris. He would not have bothered to defend it because he considered it impassable due to the strong current and depth of the river. Furthermore, Diodorus and Curtius Rufus mention that Mazaeus employed scorched-earth tactics in the countryside through which Alexander&#x27;s army had to pass.

After the Macedonian army had crossed the Tigris, a near-total lunar eclipse occurred on 20–21 September 331 BC. Four days later, Alexander&#x27;s army spotted members of Mazaeus&#x27; cavalry and captured one or two, who gave information about the location of Darius&#x27; army at Gaugamela, some eight miles away. In light of the ground-flattening efforts taking place at Gaugamela, Alexander determined that Darius did not intend to change locations, and allowed his troops four days to rest before engaging Darius&#x27; army in battle. Following the calculations, the date of the Battle of Gaugamela must have been 1 October in 331 BC.

=== Strategic analysis ===

Several researchers have criticized the Persians for their failure to harass Alexander&#x27;s army and disrupt its long supply lines when it advanced through Mesopotamia. Classical scholar Peter Green thinks that Alexander&#x27;s choice for the northern route caught the Persians off guard. Darius would have expected him to take the faster southern route directly to Babylon, just as Cyrus the Younger had done in 401 BC before his defeat in the Battle of Cunaxa. The use of the scorched-earth tactic and scythed chariots by Darius suggests that he wanted to repeat that battle. Alexander would have been unable to adequately supply his army if he had taken the southern route, even if the scorched-earth tactic had failed. The Macedonian army, underfed and exhausted from the heat, would then be defeated at the plain of Cunaxa by Darius. When Alexander took the northern route, Mazaeus must have returned to Babylon to bring the news. Darius most likely decided to prevent Alexander from crossing the Tigris. This plan failed because Alexander probably took a river crossing that was closer to Thapsacus than Babylon. He would have improvised and chosen Gaugamela as his most favourable site for a battle. Historian Jona Lendering, by contrast, argues that Darius intentionally led the Macedonians to Gaugamela, the Persians&#x27; preferred battlefield.

==Location==
The precise location of the battlefield is not known with certainty, as the ancient sources are sometimes inconsistent and do not provide precise topographical or geographical information. Various sites have been proposed: Tel Gomel, Karamlesh, Qaraqosh, Tell Aswad, and a mound south of Wardak. The most commonly accepted opinion about the location is Karamlesh – suggested by archeologist Sir Aurel Stein in 1938. All of these sites are located in the Nineveh Plains of modern-day Iraq, east of Mosul and west of Erbil, north and south of Jebel Maqlub (also known as Mount Maqlub and Mount Alfaf).

==Size of Persian army==
=== Modern estimates ===

Although there is general acceptance among modern scholars of Arrian&#x27;s numbers for Alexander&#x27;s forces, the opposite is true with respect to the ancient sources&#x27; reports on the size of Darius&#x27;s army. According to Bichler, among modern authors, &quot;[t]heir common ground is only that the excessively high numbers given in the ancient sources are of no use.&quot; Similarly, Worthington writes that the figures given by Diodorus, Plutarch, and Curtius &quot;are absurdly high numbers to show how hopelessly outnumbered Alexander&#x27;s army was[.]&quot; 

Reinhold Bichler&#x27;s case study surveyed 20 different sources published between 1920 and 2014, showing that various authors have given widely divergent estimates of Darius&#x27;s forces, with others remarking that it is not possible to reach any conclusion other than that Alexander&#x27;s army was outnumbered by the Persians. Hans Delbrück estimates Persian cavalry at 12,000 because of management issues, Persian infantry less than that of the Greek heavy infantry, and Greek mercenaries at 8,000. estimates a total size of 91,000; 120,000; and no larger than 100,000.

=== Ancient sources ===

According to Arrian, Darius&#x27; force numbered 40,000 cavalry and 1,000,000 infantry, Diodorus Siculus put it at 200,000 cavalry and 800,000 infantry, Plutarch put it at 1,000,000 troops (without a breakdown in composition), while according to Curtius Rufus it consisted of 45,000 cavalry and 200,000 infantry. Furthermore, according to Arrian, Diodorus and Curtius, Darius had 200 chariots while Arrian mentions 15 war elephants. Included in Darius&#x27;s infantry were about 2,000 Greek mercenary hoplites.

According to Arrian, Indian troops were also deployed. He explains that Darius III &quot;obtained the help of those Indians who bordered on the Bactrians, together with the Bactrians and Sogdianians themselves, all under the command of Bessus, the Satrap of Bactria&quot;. The Indians in question were probably from the area of Gandāra. Indian &quot;hill-men&quot; are also said by Arrian to have joined the Arachotians under Satrap Barsentes, and are thought to have been either the Sattagydians or the Hindush.

While Darius had a significant advantage in numbers, most of his troops were of a lower quality than Alexander&#x27;s. Alexander&#x27;s pezhetairoi were armed with a six-metre pike, the sarissa. The main Persian infantry was poorly trained and equipped in comparison to Alexander&#x27;s pezhetairoi and hoplites. The only respectable infantry Darius had were his 2,000 Greek hoplites and his personal bodyguard, the 10,000 Immortals. The Greek mercenaries fought in a phalanx, armed not with a heavy shield but with spears no longer than three metres, while the spears of the Immortals were two metres long. Among the other Persian troops, the most heavily armed were the Armenians, who were armed the Greek way and probably fought as a phalanx.

==Size of Macedonian army==

Alexander commanded Greek forces from his kingdom of Macedon and the Hellenic League, along with Greek mercenaries and levies from the Paeonian and Thracian tributary peoples. According to Arrian, his forces numbered 7,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. Most historians agree that the Macedonian army consisted of 31,000 heavy infantry, including mercenaries and hoplites from other allied Greek states in reserve, with an additional 9,000 light infantry consisting mainly of peltasts with some archers. The size of the Greek-mounted army was about 7,000.

==Battle==
===Initial dispositions===
The battle began with the Persians already present on the battlefield. Darius had recruited the finest cavalry from his Eastern satrapies and from allied Scythian tribes and deployed scythed chariots, for which he had ordered bushes and vegetation removed from the battlefield to maximize their effectiveness. He also had 15 Indian elephants supported by Indian chariots. However, the absence of any mention of those elephants during the battle and their later capture in the Persian camp indicate they were withdrawn. The reason might have been fatigue.


Darius placed himself in the center with his best infantry, as was the tradition among Persian kings. He was surrounded by, on his right, the Carian cavalry, Greek mercenaries and Persian horse guards. In the right-center, he placed Persian foot guards (Apple Bearers/Immortals to the Greeks), the Indian cavalry and his Mardian archers.

On both flanks were the cavalry. Bessus commanded the left flank with the Bactrians, Dahae cavalry, Arachosian cavalry, Persian cavalry, Susian cavalry, Cadusian cavalry and Scythians. Chariots were placed in front with a small group of Bactrians. Mazaeus commanded the right flank with the Syrian, Median, Mesopotamian, Parthian, Sacian, Tapurian, Hyrcanian, Caucasian Albanian, Sacesinian, Cappadocian and Armenian cavalry. The Cappadocians and Armenians were stationed in front of the other cavalry units and led the attack. The Albanian cavalry were sent around to flank the Greek left. According to Curtius, the archers were all Amardi.

The Macedonians were divided into two, with the right side under the direct command of Alexander and the left of Parmenion. Alexander fought with his Companion cavalry. With it was the Paionian and Greek light cavalry. The mercenary cavalry was divided into two groups, veterans on the flank of the right and the rest in front of the Agrianes and Greek archers, who were stationed next to the phalanx. Parmenion was stationed on the left with the Thessalians, Greek mercenaries and Thracian cavalry. There they were to conduct a holding action while Alexander launched the decisive blow from the right.

On the right-center were Cretan mercenaries. Behind them were Thessalian cavalry under Phillip, and Achaean mercenaries. To their right was another part of the allied Greek cavalry. From there came the phalanx, in a double line. Outnumbered over 5:1 in the cavalry, with their line surpassed by over a mile, it seemed inevitable that the Greeks would be flanked by the Persians. The second line was given orders to deal with any flanking units should the situation arise. This second line consisted mostly of mercenaries.

===Beginning of the battle===
Alexander began by ordering his infantry to march in phalanx formation towards the center of the enemy line. The Macedonians advanced with the wings echeloned back at 45 degrees to lure the Persian cavalry to attack. While the phalanxes battled the Persian infantry, Darius sent a large part of his cavalry and some of his regular infantry to attack Parmenion&#x27;s forces on the left.

During the battle, Alexander employed an unusual strategy which has been duplicated only a few times. While the infantry battled the Persian troops in the centre, Alexander began to ride all the way to the edge of the right flank, accompanied by his Companion Cavalry. His plan was to draw as much of the Persian cavalry as possible to the flanks, to create a gap within the enemy line where a decisive blow could then be struck at Darius in the centre. This required almost perfect timing and maneuvering and Alexander himself to act first. He would force Darius to attack (as they would soon move off the prepared ground), though Darius did not want to be the first to attack after seeing what happened at Issus against a similar formation. In the end, Darius&#x27; hand was forced, and he attacked.

===Cavalry battle in the Hellenic right wing===

The Scythian cavalry from the Persian left wing opened the battle by attempting to flank Alexander&#x27;s extreme right. What followed was a long and fierce cavalry battle between the Persian left and the Macedonian right, in which the latter, being greatly outnumbered, was often hard-pressed. However, by careful use of reserves and disciplined charges, the Greek troops were able to contain their Persian counterparts, which would be vital for the success of Alexander&#x27;s decisive attack.

As told by Arrian:

Then the Scythian cavalry rode along the line and came into conflict with the front men of Alexander&#x27;s array, but he nevertheless still continued to march towards the right, and almost entirely got beyond the ground which had been cleared and levelled by the Persians. Then Darius, fearing that his chariots would become useless, if the Macedonians advanced into the uneven ground, ordered the front ranks of his left wing to ride round the right wing of the Macedonians, where Alexander was commanding, to prevent him from marching his wing any further. This being done, Alexander ordered the cavalry of the Grecian mercenaries under the command of Menidas to attack them. But the Scythian cavalry and the Bactrians, who had been drawn up with them, sallied forth against them and being much more numerous they put the small body of Greeks to rout. Alexander then ordered Aristo at the head of the Paeonians and Grecian auxiliaries to attack the Scythians, and the barbarians gave way. But the rest of the Bactrians, drawing near to the Paeonians and Grecian auxiliaries, caused their own comrades who were already in flight to turn and renew the battle; and thus they brought about a general cavalry engagement, in which more of Alexander&#x27;s men fell, not only being overwhelmed by the multitude of the barbarians, but also because the Scythians themselves and their horses were much more completely protected with armour for guarding their bodies. Notwithstanding this, the Macedonians sustained their assaults, and assailing them violently squadron by squadron, they succeeded in pushing them out of rank.

The tide finally turned in the Greek favor after the attack of Aretes&#x27; Prodromoi, likely their last reserve in this sector of the battlefield. By then, however, the battle had been decided in the center by Alexander himself.

The Persians also who were riding round the wing were seized with alarm when Aretes made a vigorous attack upon them. In this quarter indeed the Persians took to speedy flight; and the Macedonians followed up the fugitives and slaughtered them.

=== Attack of the Persian scythed chariots ===
Darius now launched his chariots at those troops under Alexander&#x27;s personal command; many of the chariots were intercepted by the Agrianians and other javelin-throwers posted in front of the Companion cavalry. Those chariots who made it through the barrage of javelins charged the Macedonian lines, which responded by opening up their ranks, creating alleys through which the chariots passed harmlessly. The hypaspists and the armed grooms of the cavalry then attacked and eliminated these survivors.

===Alexander&#x27;s decisive attack===
As the Persians advanced farther and farther to the Greek flanks in their attack, Alexander slowly filtered in his rear guard. He disengaged his Companions and prepared for the decisive attack. Behind them were the guard&#x27;s brigade along with any phalanx battalions he could withdraw from the battle. He formed his units into a giant wedge, with him leading the charge. The Persian infantry at the center was still fighting the phalanxes, hindering any attempts to counter Alexander&#x27;s charge. This large wedge then smashed into the weakened Persian center, taking out Darius&#x27; royal guard and the Greek mercenaries. Darius was in danger of being cut off, and the widely held modern view is that he now broke and ran, with the rest of his army following him. This is based on Arrian&#x27;s account:

For a short time there ensued a hand-to-hand fight; but when the Macedonian cavalry, commanded by Alexander himself, pressed on vigorously, thrusting themselves against the Persians and striking their faces with their spears, and when the Macedonian phalanx in dense array and bristling with long pikes had also made an attack upon them, all things together appeared full of terror to Darius, who had already long been in a state of fear, so that he was the first to turn and flee.

===Left flank===

Alexander could have pursued Darius at this point. However, he received desperate messages from Parmenion (an event that would later be used by Callisthenes and others to discredit Parmenion) on the left. Parmenion&#x27;s wing was apparently encircled by the cavalry of the Persian right wing; being attacked from all sides, it was in a state of confusion. Alexander was faced with the choice of pursuing Darius and having the chance of killing him, ending the war in one stroke but at the risk of losing his army, or going back to the left flank to aid Parmenion and preserve his forces, thus letting Darius escape to the surrounding mountains. He decided to help Parmenion, and followed Darius later.

While holding on the left, a gap had opened up between the left and center of the Macedonian phalanx, due to Simmias&#x27; brigade of pezhetairoi being unable to follow Alexander in his decisive attack, as they were being hard-pressed. The Persian and Indian cavalry in the center with Darius broke through. Instead of taking the phalanx or Parmenion in the rear, however, they continued towards the camp to loot. They also tried to rescue the Queen Mother, Sisygambis, but she refused to go with them. These raiders were in turn attacked and dispersed by the rear reserve phalanx as they were looting.

What happened next was described by Arrian as the fiercest engagement of the battle, as Alexander and his companions encountered the cavalry of the Persian right, composed of Indians, Parthians and &quot;the bravest and most numerous division of the Persians&quot;, desperately trying to get through to escape. Sixty Companions were killed in the engagement, and Hephaestion, Coenus and Menidas were all injured. Alexander prevailed, however, and Mazaeus also began to pull his forces back as Bessus had. However, unlike on the left with Bessus, the Persians soon fell into disorder as the Thessalians and other cavalry units charged forward at their fleeing enemy.

==Aftermath==

After the battle, Parmenion rounded up the Persian baggage train while Alexander and his bodyguard pursued Darius. As at Issus, substantial loot was gained, with 4,000 talents captured, the King&#x27;s personal chariot and bow and the war elephants. It was a disastrous defeat for the Persians and one of Alexander&#x27;s finest victories.

Darius managed to escape by horseback with a small corps of his forces remaining intact. The Bactrian cavalry and Bessus caught up with him, as did some of the survivors of the Royal Guard and 2,000 Greek mercenaries. At this point, the Persian Empire was divided into two halves—East and West. On his escape, Darius gave a speech to what remained of his army. He planned to head further east and raise another army to face Alexander, assuming that the Greeks would head towards Babylon. At the same time he dispatched letters to his eastern satraps asking them to remain loyal.

The satraps, however, had other intentions. Bessus murdered Darius before fleeing eastwards. When Alexander discovered Darius murdered, he was saddened to see an enemy he respected killed in such a fashion, and gave Darius a full burial ceremony at Persepolis, the former ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire, before angrily pursuing Bessus, capturing and executing him the following year. The majority of the remaining satraps gave their loyalty to Alexander and were allowed to keep their positions. The Achaemenid Persian Empire is traditionally considered to have ended with the death of Darius.

<text>Frederick Jackson Turner (November 14, 1861 – March 14, 1932) was an American historian during the early 20th century, based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison until 1910, and then Harvard University. He was known primarily for his frontier thesis. He trained many PhDs who went on to become well-known historians. He promoted interdisciplinary and quantitative methods, often with an emphasis on the Midwestern United States.

Turner&#x27;s essay &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot; included ideas that formed the frontier thesis. In it, Turner argued that the moving western frontier exerted a strong influence on American democracy and the American character from the colonial era until 1890. He is also known for his theories of geographical sectionalism. During recent years historians and academics have argued frequently over Turner&#x27;s work; however, all agree that the frontier thesis has had an enormous effect on historical scholarship.

==Early life and education==
Born in Portage, Wisconsin, the son of Andrew Jackson Turner and Mary Olivia Hanford Turner, Turner grew up in a middle-class family. His father was active in Republican politics, an investor in a railroad, and was a newspaper editor and publisher. His mother taught school. Turner was very much influenced by the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson, a poet known for his emphasis on nature; so too was Turner influenced by scientists such as Charles Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and Julian Huxley, and the development of cartography. In 1884, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin, which was later renamed the University of Wisconsin–Madison. While there, Turner was a member of tPhi Kappa Psi fraternity.

He earned his PhD in history from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1890 with a thesis on the fur trade in Wisconsin, titled &quot;The Character and Influence of the Indian Trade in Wisconsin&quot;, under the academic supervision of Herbert Baxter Adams.

==Career==
Turner did not publish extensively; his influence came from tersely expressed interpretive theories in his articles, which influenced his hundreds of disciples. Two theories, in particular, were influential, the &quot;Frontier Thesis&quot; and the &quot;Sectional Hypothesis&quot;.

Although he published little, he had an encyclopedic knowledge of American history, earning a reputation by 1910 as one of the two or three most influential historians in the country. He proved adept at promoting his ideas and his students, for whom he obtained jobs in major universities, including Merle Curti and Marcus Lee Hansen. He circulated copies of his essays and lectures to important scholars and literary people, published extensively in magazines, recycled favorite material, attaining the largest possible audience for major concepts,&lt;ref name=&quot;SM 2023-01/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and wielded considerable influence within the American Historical Association as an officer and advisor for &quot;The American Historical Review&quot;. His emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the major history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history compatible with Turner&#x27;s theories.

Annoyed by the university regents who demanded less research and more teaching and state service, Turner sought an environment that would permit him to do more research. Declining offers from the University of California, he accepted an offer from Harvard University in 1910 and remained a professor there until 1922, being succeeded in 1924 by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. In 1907 Turner was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and in 1911 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Turner was never comfortable at Harvard; when he retired in 1922 he became a visiting scholar at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, where his note cards and files continued to accumulate, although few monographs got published. His &quot;The Frontier in American History&quot; (1920) was a collection of older essays.

As a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin from 1890 to 1910 and Harvard from 1910 to 1922, Turner trained scores of disciples who, in turn, dominated American history programs throughout the country. His model of sectionalism as a composite of social forces, such as ethnicity and land ownership, encouraged historians to use social history to analyze social, economic and political developments of American history. At the American Historical Association, he collaborated with J. Franklin Jameson on numerous major projects.

Turner&#x27;s theories became unfashionable during the 1960s, as critics complained that he neglected regionalism. They complained that he claimed too much egalitarianism and democracy for a frontier that was restrictive for women and minorities. After Turner&#x27;s death his former colleague Isaiah Bowman had this to say of his work: &quot;Turner&#x27;s ideas were curiously wanting in evidence from field studies...He represents a type of historian who rests his case on documents and general impression rather than a scientist who goes out for to see.&quot; His ideas were never forgotten; indeed they influenced the new field of environmental history. Turner gave a strong impetus to quantitative methods, and scholars using new statistical techniques and data sets have, for example, confirmed many of Turner&#x27;s suggestions about population movements. Turner believed that because of his own biases and the amount of conflicting historical evidence that any one method of historical interpretation would be insufficient, that an interdisciplinary method was the most accurate way to analyze history.

==Works==
===Frontier thesis===

Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis was developed in a scholarly paper of 1893, &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot;, read before the American Historical Association in Chicago during the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (Chicago World&#x27;s Fair). He believed the spirit and success of the United States was associated directly with the country&#x27;s westward expansion. Turner expounded an evolutionary model; he had been influenced by work with geologists at Wisconsin. The West, not the East, was where distinctively American characteristics emerged. The creation of the unique American identity occurred at the juncture between the &quot;civilization&quot; of settlement and the &quot;savagery&quot; of wilderness. This produced a new type of citizen – one with the power to &quot;tame the wild&quot; and one upon whom the wild had conferred strength and individuality. As each generation of pioneers relocated 50 to 100 miles west, they abandoned useless European practices, institutions and ideas, and instead found new solutions to new problems created by their new environment. Over multiple generations, the frontier produced characteristics of informality, violence, crudeness, democracy and initiative that the world recognized as &quot;American&quot;.

Turner ignored gender, and he did not emphasize class. Historians of the 1960s and later stressed that race, class and gender were major influencers of history. The new generation stresses gender, ethnicity, professional categorization, and the contrasting victor and victim legacies of manifest destiny and colonial expansion. Most professional historians operating within the &quot;au courant&quot; postmodern paradigm now criticize Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis and the theme of American exceptionalism. The disunity of the concept of the West and the similarity of American expansion to European colonialism and imperialism during the 19th century, and the lack of complete egalitarianism even on the frontier revealed the limits of Turnerian and exceptionalist paradigms.

===Sectionalism===
Turner&#x27;s sectionalism essays are collected in &quot;The Significance of Sections in American History&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1933. Turner&#x27;s sectionalism thesis had almost as much influence among historians as his frontier thesis, but never became widely known to the general public as did the frontier thesis. He argued that different ethnocultural groups had distinct settlement patterns, and this revealed itself in politics, economics and society.

==Influence and legacy==
Turner&#x27;s ideas influenced many types of historiography. Concerning the history of religion, for example, Boles (1993) notes that William Warren Sweet at the University of Chicago Divinity School argued that churches adapted to the characteristics of the frontier, creating new denominations such as the LDS Church, the Church of Christ, the Disciples of Christ, and the Cumberland Presbyterians. The frontier, they argued, created uniquely American institutions such as revivals, camp meetings, and itinerant preaching. This opinion dominated religious historiography for decades. Moos (2002) says that the 1910s to 1940s black filmmaker and novelist Oscar Micheaux incorporated Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis into his work. Micheaux promoted the West as a place where blacks could transcend race and earn economic success through diligent work and perseverance.

Citing Turner&#x27;s &quot;frontier thesis,&quot; Friedrich Ratzel believed that the German campaign to colonize German South West Africa could serve to &quot;harden (the German) character.&quot;

Slatta (2001) maintains that the widespread popularization of Turner&#x27;s frontier thesis influenced popular histories, motion pictures, and novels, which characterize the West in terms of individualism, frontier violence, and rough justice. Disneyland&#x27;s Frontierland of the late 20th century represented the myth of rugged individualism that celebrated what was perceived to be the American heritage. The public has ignored academic historians&#x27;, David J. Weber for example, anti-Turnerian models, largely because they conflict with and often destroy the legends of Western heritage. However, the work of historians during the 1980s–1990s, some of whom sought to discredit Turner&#x27;s conception of the frontier and others who have sought to spare the concept while presenting a more balanced and nuanced version of it, have done much to place Western myths in context.

The Frederick Jackson Turner Award is given annually by the Organization of American Historians for an author&#x27;s first scholarly book on American history.

Turner&#x27;s former home in Madison, Wisconsin is located in what is now the Langdon Street Historic District.

In 2009 he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Marriage, family, and death==
Turner married Caroline Mae Sherwood in Chicago in November 1889. They had three children: only one survived childhood. Dorothy Kinsley Turner (later Main) was the mother of the historian Jackson Turner Main (1917–2003), a scholar of Revolutionary America who married a fellow scholar.

Frederick Jackson Turner died in 1932 in Pasadena, California, where he had been a research associate at the Huntington Library.

<doc id="241938" wikidata="Q818670" url="?curid=241938" title="Penology">
<text>Penology (also penal theory) is a subfield of criminology that deals with the philosophy and practice of various societies in their attempts to repress criminal activities, and satisfy public opinion via an appropriate treatment regime for persons convicted of criminal offences.

The Oxford English Dictionary defines penology as &quot;the study of the punishment of crime and prison management,&quot; and in this sense it is equivalent with corrections. The term &quot;penology&quot; comes from &quot;penal&quot;, Latin &quot;poena&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot; and the Greek suffix &quot;-logia&quot;, &quot;study of&quot;.

Penology is concerned with the effectiveness of those social processes devised and adopted for the prevention of crime, via the repression or inhibition of criminal intent via the fear of punishment. The study of penology therefore deals with the treatment of prisoners and the subsequent rehabilitation of convicted criminals. It also encompasses aspects of probation (rehabilitation of offenders in the community) as well as penitentiary science relating to the secure detention and retraining of offenders committed to secure institutions.

Penology concerns many topics and theories, including those concerning prisons (prison reform, prisoner abuse, prisoners&#x27; rights, and recidivism), as well as theories of the purposes of punishment (deterrence, retribution, incapacitation and rehabilitation). Contemporary penology concerns itself mainly with criminal rehabilitation and prison management. The word seldom applies to theories and practices of punishment in less formal environments such as parenting, school and workplace correctional measures.

==History==

Historical theories were based on the notion that fearful consequences would discourage potential offenders. An example of this principle can be found in the Draconian law of Ancient Greece and the Bloody Code which persisted in Renaissance England, when (at various times) capital punishment was prescribed for over 200 offenses. Similarly, certain hudud offenses under Sharia hadith tradition may incur fearful penalties.

Modern theories of the punishment and rehabilitation of offenders are broadly based on principles articulated in the seminal pamphlet &quot;On Crimes and Punishments&quot; published by Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria in 1764. They center on the concept of proportionality. In this respect, they differ from many previous systems of punishment, for example, England&#x27;s Bloody Code, under which the penalty of theft had been the same regardless of the value stolen, giving rise to the English expression &quot;It is as well to be hanged for a sheep or a lamb&quot;. Subsequent development of the ideas of Beccaria made non-lethal punishment more acceptable. Consequently, convicted prisoners had to be re-integrated into society when their punishment was complete.

Penologists have consequently evolved occupational and psychological education programs for offenders detained in prison, and a range of community service and probation orders which entail guidance and aftercare of the offender within the community. The importance of inflicting some measure of punishment on those persons who breach the law is however maintained in order to maintain social order and to moderate public outrage which might provoke appeals for cruel vengeance. 

More recently, some penologists have shifted from a retributive based punishment to a form of community corrections. &quot;Community corrections involves the management and supervision of offenders in the community. These offenders are serving court-imposed orders either as an alternative to imprisonment or as a condition of their release on parole from prison. This means they must report regularly to their community corrections officer and may have to participate in unpaid community work and rehabilitation programs.&quot;

<text>The gens Claudia (), sometimes written Clodia, was one of the most prominent patrician houses at ancient Rome. The gens traced its origin to the earliest days of the Roman Republic. The first of the Claudii to obtain the consulship was Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis, in 495 BC, and from that time its members frequently held the highest offices of the state, both under the Republic and in imperial times.

Plebeian Claudii are found fairly early in Rome&#x27;s history. Some may have been descended from members of the family who had passed over to the plebeians, while others were probably the descendants of freedmen of the gens. In the later Republic, one of its patrician members voluntarily converted to plebeian status and adopted the spelling &quot;Clodius&quot;.

In his life of the emperor Tiberius, who was a scion of the Claudii, the historian Suetonius gives a summary of the gens, and says, &quot;as time went on it was honoured with twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven censorships, six triumphs, and two ovations.&quot; Writing several decades after the fall of the so-called &quot;Julio-Claudian dynasty&quot;, Suetonius took care to mention both the good and wicked deeds attributed to members of the family.

The patrician Claudii were noted for their pride and arrogance, and intense hatred of the commonalty. In his &quot;History of Rome,&quot; Niebuhr writes,
That house during the course of centuries produced several very eminent, few great men; hardly a single noble-minded one. In all ages it distinguished itself alike by a spirit of haughty defiance, by disdain for the laws, and iron hardness of heart.
During the Republic, no patrician Claudius adopted a member of another gens; the emperor Claudius was the first who broke this custom, by adopting Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, afterwards the emperor Nero.

==Origin==
According to legend, the first of the Claudii was a Sabine, by the name of &quot;Attius Clausus&quot;, who came to Rome with his retainers in 504 BC, the sixth year of the Republic. At this time, the fledgling Republic was engaged in regular warfare with the Sabines, and Clausus is said to have been the leader of a faction seeking to end the conflict. When his efforts failed, he defected to the Romans, bringing with him no fewer than five hundred men able to bear arms, according to Dionysius.

Clausus, who exchanged his Sabine name for the Latin &quot;Appius Claudius&quot;, was enrolled among the patricians, and given a seat in the Senate, quickly becoming one of its most influential members. His descendants were granted a burial site at the foot of the Capitoline Hill, and his followers allotted land on the far side of the Anio, where they formed the core of what became the &quot;Old Claudian&quot; tribe.

The emperor Claudius is said to have referred to these traditions in a speech made before the senate, in which he argued in favor of admitting Gauls to that body. &quot;My ancestors, the most ancient of whom was made at once a citizen and a noble of Rome, encourage me to govern by the same policy of transferring to this city all conspicuous merit, wherever found.&quot; By imperial times, the influence of the Claudii was so great that the poet Virgil flattered them by a deliberate anachronism. In his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, he makes Attius Clausus a contemporary of Aeneas, to whose side he rallies with a host of &quot;quirites&quot;, or spearmen.

The nomen &quot;Claudius&quot;, originally &quot;Clausus&quot;, is usually said to be derived from the Latin adjective &quot;claudus&quot;, meaning &quot;lame&quot;. As a cognomen, &quot;Claudus&quot; is occasionally found in other gentes. However, since there is no tradition that any of the early Claudii were lame, the nomen might refer to some ancestor of Attius Clausus. It could also have been metaphorical, or ironic, and the possibility remains that this derivation is erroneous. The change from &quot;Clausus&quot; to &quot;Claudius&quot;, and its common by-form, &quot;Clodius&quot;, involves the alternation of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;au&quot;, which seems to have been common in words of Sabine origin. The alternation of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;d&quot; occurs in words borrowed from Greek: Latin &quot;rosa&quot; from Greek &quot;rhodon&quot;; but in this instance &quot;clausus&quot; or &quot;*closus&quot; is a Sabine word becoming &quot;clod-&quot; in Latin. The name could have come from Greek settlers in Latium, but there is no evidence in favor of this hypothesis.

==Praenomina==
The early Claudii favored the praenomina &quot;Appius, Gaius&quot;, and &quot;Publius&quot;. These names were used by the patrician Claudii throughout their history. &quot;Tiberius&quot; was used by the family of the Claudii Nerones, while &quot;Marcus&quot;, although used occasionally by the earliest patrician Claudii, was favored by the plebeian branches of the family. According to Suetonius, the gens avoided the praenomen &quot;Lucius&quot; because two early members with this name had brought dishonor upon the family, one having been convicted of highway robbery, and the other of murder. However, the name was used by at least one branch of the Claudii in the final century of the Republic, including one who, as &quot;Rex Sacrorum&quot;, was certainly patrician. To these names, the plebeian Claudii added &quot;Quintus&quot; and &quot;Sextus&quot;, though Elizabeth Rawson has argued that &quot;Quintus&quot; was acceptable among the Pulchri as well.

The praenomen &quot;Appius&quot; is often said to have been unique to the Claudii, and nothing more than a Latinization of the Sabine &quot;Attius&quot;. But in fact there are other figures in Roman history named &quot;Appius&quot;, and in later times the name was used by plebeian families such as the Junii and the Annii. Thus, it seems more accurate to say that the Claudii were the only patrician family at Rome known to have used &quot;Appius&quot;. As for its Sabine equivalent, &quot;Attius&quot; has been the subject of much discussion by philologists. The form &quot;Attus&quot; is mentioned by Valerius Maximus, who connected it with the bucolic Greek name Atys. Braasch translated it as &quot;Väterchen&quot;, &quot;little father,&quot; and connected it with a series of childhood parental names: &quot;atta, tata, acca,&quot; and the like, becoming such names as &quot;Tatius&quot; (also Sabine) and &quot;Atilius&quot;.

During the late Republic and early Empire, the Claudii Nerones, who gave rise to the Imperial family, adopted the praenomen &quot;Decimus&quot;, seldom used by any patrician family. Subsequently they began to exchange traditional praenomina for names that first entered the family as cognomina, such as &quot;Nero&quot;, &quot;Drusus&quot;, and &quot;Germanicus&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
The patrician Claudii bore various surnames, including &quot;Caecus&quot;, &quot;Caudex&quot;, &quot;Centho&quot;, &quot;Crassus&quot;, &quot;Nero&quot;, &quot;Pulcher&quot;, &quot;Regillensis&quot;, and &quot;Sabinus&quot;. The latter two, though applicable to all of the gens, were seldom used when there was a more definite cognomen. A few of the patrician Claudii are mentioned without any surname. The surnames of the plebeian Claudii were &quot;Asellus&quot;, &quot;Canina&quot;, &quot;Centumalus&quot;, &quot;Cicero&quot;, &quot;Flamen&quot;, &quot;Glaber&quot;, and &quot;Marcellus&quot;.

The earliest Claudii bore the surname &quot;Sabinus&quot;, a common surname usually referring to a Sabine, or someone of Sabine descent, which according to all tradition, the Claudii were. This cognomen was first adopted by Appius Claudius, the founder of the gens, and was retained by his descendants, until it was replaced by &quot;Crassus&quot;.

&quot;Regillensis&quot; or &quot;Inregillensis&quot;, a surname of the earliest Claudii, is said to be derived from the town of Regillum, a Sabine settlement, where Appius Claudius lived with his family and retainers before coming to Rome. Its exact location is unknown, but it must have been in the vicinity of Lake Regillus, where one of the most important battles in the early history of the Roman Republic was fought. The same cognomen was borne by a family of the Postumii, although in this instance the surname is supposed to have been derived from the Battle of Lake Regillus, in which the victorious Roman general was the dictator Aulus Postumius Albus.

&quot;Crassus&quot;, sometimes given as the diminutive &quot;Crassinus&quot;, was a common surname usually translated as &quot;thick, solid,&quot; or &quot;dull&quot;. This cognomen succeeded that of &quot;Sabinus&quot; as the surname of the main family of the Claudia gens. It was borne by members of the family from the fifth to the third century BC. The other main families of the patrician Claudii were descended from Appius Claudius Caecus, the last recorded member of the Claudii Crassi, who gave a different cognomen to each of his four sons: &quot;Russus&quot; (or &quot;Rufus&quot;), &quot;Pulcher, Cento&quot; or &quot;Centho&quot;, and &quot;Nero&quot;.

&quot;Pulcher&quot;, the surname of the next major branch of the Claudia gens, means &quot;beautiful&quot;, although it may be that the cognomen was given ironically. The Claudii Pulchri were an extensive family, which supplied the Republic with several consuls, and survived into imperial times.

The other main branch of the patrician Claudii bore the surname &quot;Nero&quot;, originally a Sabine praenomen described as meaning, &quot;fortis ac strenuus&quot;, which roughly translated is &quot;strong and sturdy.&quot; It may be the same as the Umbrian praenomen &quot;Nerius&quot;. This family was distinguished throughout the latter Republic, and gave rise to several of the early emperors, including Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. An oddity of the names by which these emperors are known today is that several of their ancestors bore the name &quot;Tiberius Claudius Nero&quot;; of three emperors belonging to the same family, one is known by a praenomen, one by a nomen, and one by a cognomen. Some members of the imperial family adopted the fashion of wearing their hair short at the sides and front but long in the back, over the nape of the neck. Describing the appearance of Tiberius, Suetonius calls it a family trait. This style visible on some busts of Tiberius and Caligula, his grandnephew and successor.

The most illustrious family of the plebeian Claudii bore the surname &quot;Marcellus&quot;, which is a diminutive of the praenomen &quot;Marcus&quot;. They gained everlasting fame from the exploits of Marcus Claudius Marcellus, one of Rome&#x27;s finest generals, and a towering figure of the Second Punic War, who was five times consul, and won the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, defeating and killing the Gallic king, Viridomarus, in single combat.

Most of those who used the spelling &quot;Clodius&quot; were descended from plebeian members of the gens, but one family by this name was a cadet branch of the patrician Claudii Pulchri, which voluntarily went over to the plebeians, and used the spelling &quot;Clodius&quot; to differentiate themselves from their patrician relatives.

&quot;Caecus&quot;, the surname of one of the Claudii Crassi, refers to the condition of his blindness, which is well-attested, although it appears that he did not become blind until his old age. Caecus&#x27; initial cognomen was Crassus. According to one legend, he was struck blind by the gods during his censorship, after inducing the ancient family of the Potitii to teach the sacred rites of Hercules to the public slaves. The Potitii themselves were said to have perished as a result of this sacrilege. However, Claudius was relatively young at the time of his censorship in 312 BC, and was elected consul sixteen years later, in 296.

Caecus&#x27; brother, who shared the same praenomen, was distinguished by the cognomen &quot;Caudex&quot;, literally meaning a &quot;treetrunk&quot;, although metaphorically it was an insult, meaning a &quot;dolt.&quot; According to Seneca, he obtained the surname from his attention to naval affairs.

<text>Hopeton Overton Brown (born 18 April 1960 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a recording engineer and producer who rose to fame in the 1980s mixing dub music as &quot;Scientist&quot;. A protégé of King Tubby (Osbourne Ruddock), Scientist&#x27;s contemporaries include several figures who, working at King Tubby&#x27;s studio, had helped pioneer the genre in the 1970s: Ruddock, Bunny Lee, Philip Smart, Pat Kelly and Prince Jammy.

==The 1970s: King Tubby&#x27;s, Channel One, and Studio One==
Scientist was introduced to electronics by his father, who worked as a television and radio repair technician. He began building his own amplifiers and would buy transformers from Tubby&#x27;s Dromilly Road studio. While at the studio, Scientist asked Tubby to give him a chance at mixing. He was taken on at Tubby&#x27;s as an assistant, performing tasks such as winding transformer coils, and began working as a mixer in the mid-1970s, initially creating dubs of reworked Studio One tracks for Don Mais&#x27;s Roots Tradition label, given his chance when Prince Jammy cut short a mixing session for Mais because he was too tired to continue. His name originated from a comment by Bunny Lee to King Tubby, with regard to his technical proficiency, &quot;Damn, this little boy must be a scientist.&quot;

He left King Tubby&#x27;s at the end of the 1970s and became the principal engineer for Channel One when hired by the Hoo Kim brothers, giving him the chance to work on a 16-track mixing desk rather than the four tracks at Tubby&#x27;s.

==The 1980s: King Tubby&#x27;s, Tuff Gong==
Scientist came to prominence in the early 1980s and produced many albums, his mixes featuring on many releases in the first part of the decade. He made a series of albums in the early 1980s, released on Greensleeves Records with titles themed around Scientist&#x27;s fictional achievements in fighting Space Invaders, Pac-Men, and Vampires, and winning the World Cup. The music on these albums was played by Roots Radics, his most frequent collaborators. In particular, he was the favourite engineer of Henry &quot;Junjo&quot; Lawes, for whom he mixed several albums featuring Roots Radics, many based on tracks by Barrington Levy. He also did a lot of work for Linval Thompson and Jah Thomas. In 1982 he left Channel One to work at Tuff Gong studio as second engineer to Errol Brown.

Scientist worked as an engineer in recording studios in the Washington, D.C. area starting in 1985.

==Licensing issues==
Scientist has alleged in court that Greensleeves originally released albums without his knowledge, according to his interview with &quot;United Reggae&quot; online magazine. After this, Dub Мир label began working directly with Scientist to reissue his best-known work. In 2016, Greensleeves removed the Scientist moniker for a run of reissues, substituting titles such as &quot;Junjo Presents: Wins The World Cup&quot;.

<text>Penal transportation (or simply transportation) was the relocation of convicted criminals, or other persons regarded as undesirable, to a distant place, often a colony, for a specified term; later, specifically established penal colonies became their destination. While the prisoners may have been released once the sentences were served, they generally did not have the resources to return home.

==Origin and implementation==
Banishment or forced exile from a polity or society has been used as a punishment since at least the 5th century BCE in Ancient Greece. The practice of penal transportation reached its height in the British Empire during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Transportation removed the offender from society, mostly permanently, but was seen as more merciful than capital punishment. This method was used for criminals, debtors, military prisoners, and political prisoners.

Penal transportation was also used as a method of colonization. For example, from the earliest days of English colonial schemes, new settlements beyond the seas were seen as a way to alleviate domestic social problems of criminals and the poor as well as to increase the colonial labour force, for the overall benefit of the realm.

==Great Britain and the British Empire==
Initially based on the royal prerogative of mercy, and later under English law, transportation was an alternative sentence imposed for a felony. It was typically imposed for offences for which death was deemed too severe. By 1670, as new felonies were defined, the option of being sentenced to transportation was allowed. Depending on the crime, the sentence was imposed for life or for a set period of years. If imposed for a period of years, the offender was permitted to return home after serving their time, but had to make their own way back. Many offenders thus stayed in the colony as free persons, and might obtain employment as jailers or other servants of the penal colony.

England transported an estimated 50,000 to 120,000 convicts and political prisoners, as well as prisoners of war from Scotland and Ireland, to its overseas colonies in the Americas from the 1610s until early in the American Revolution in 1776, when transportation to America was temporarily suspended by the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3. c. 43). The practice was mandated in Scotland by the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3. c. 48), but was less used there than in England. Transportation on a large scale resumed with the departure of the First Fleet to Australia in 1787, and continued there until 1868.

Transportation was not used by Scotland before the Act of Union 1707; following union, the Transportation Act 1717 (4 Geo. 1. c. 11) specifically excluded its use in Scotland. Under the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3. c. 46) the Parliament of Great Britain specifically extended the usage of transportation to Scotland. It remained little used under Scots Law until the early 19th century.

In Australia, a convict who had served part of his time might apply for a ticket of leave, permitting some prescribed freedoms. This enabled some convicts to resume a more normal life, to marry and raise a family, and to contribute to the development of the colony.

===Historical background===
====Trend towards more flexibility of sentencing====
In England in the 17th and 18th centuries criminal justice was severe, later termed the Bloody Code. This was due to both the particularly large number of offences which were punishable by execution (usually by hanging), and to the limited choice of sentences available to judges for convicted criminals. With modifications to the traditional benefit of clergy, which originally exempted only clergymen from the general criminal law, it developed into a legal fiction by which many common offenders of &quot;clergyable&quot; offences were extended the privilege to avoid execution. Many offenders were pardoned as it was considered unreasonable to execute them for relatively minor offences, but under the rule of law, it was equally unreasonable for them to escape punishment entirely. With the development of colonies, transportation was introduced as an alternative punishment, although legally it was considered a condition of a pardon, rather than a sentence in itself. Convicts who represented a menace to the community were sent away to distant lands. A secondary aim was to discourage crime for fear of being transported. Transportation continued to be described as a public exhibition of the king&#x27;s mercy. It was a solution to a real problem in the domestic penal system. There was also the hope that transported convicts could be rehabilitated and reformed by starting a new life in the colonies. In 1615, in the reign of James I, a committee of the council had already obtained the power to choose from the prisoners those that deserved pardon and, consequently, transportation to the colonies. Convicts were chosen carefully: the Acts of the Privy Council showed that prisoners &quot;for strength of bodie or other abilities shall be thought fit to be employed in foreign discoveries or other services beyond the Seas&quot;.

During the Commonwealth, Oliver Cromwell overcame the popular prejudice against subjecting Christians to slavery or selling them into foreign parts, and initiated group transportation of military and civilian prisoners. With the Restoration, the penal transportation system and the number of people subjected to it, started to change inexorably between 1660 and 1720, with transportation replacing the simple discharge of clergyable felons after branding the thumb. Alternatively, under the second act dealing with Moss-trooper brigands on the Scottish border, offenders had their benefit of clergy taken away, or otherwise at the judge&#x27;s discretion, were to be transported to America, &quot;there to remaine and not to returne&quot;. There were various influential agents of change: judges&#x27; discretionary powers influenced the law significantly, but the king&#x27;s and Privy Council&#x27;s opinions were decisive in granting a royal pardon from execution.

The system changed one step at a time: in February 1663, after that first experiment, a bill was proposed to the House of Commons to allow the transporting of felons, and was followed by another bill presented to the Lords to allow the transportation of criminals convicted of felony within clergy or petty larceny. These bills failed, but it was clear that change was needed. Transportation was not a sentence in itself, but could be arranged by indirect means. The reading test, crucial for the benefit of clergy, was a fundamental feature of the penal system, but to prevent its abuse, this pardoning process was used more strictly. Prisoners were carefully selected for transportation based on information about their character and previous criminal record. It was arranged that they fail the reading test, but they were then reprieved and held in jail, without bail, to allow time for a royal pardon (subject to transportation) to be organised.

====Transportation as a commercial transaction====

Transportation became a business: merchants chose from among the prisoners on the basis of the demand for labour and their likely profits. They obtained a contract from the sheriffs, and after the voyage to the colonies they sold the convicts as indentured servants. The payment they received also covered the jail fees, the fees for granting the pardon, the clerk&#x27;s fees, and everything necessary to authorise the transportation. These arrangements for transportation continued until the end of the 17th century and beyond, but they diminished in 1670 due to certain complications. The colonial opposition was one of the main obstacles: colonies were unwilling to collaborate in accepting prisoners: the convicts represented a danger to the colony and were unwelcome. Maryland and Virginia enacted laws to prohibit transportation in 1670, and the king was persuaded to respect these.

The penal system was also influenced by economics: the profits obtained from convicts&#x27; labour boosted the economy of the colonies and, consequently, of England. Nevertheless, it could be argued that transportation was economically deleterious because the aim was to enlarge population, not diminish it; but the character of an individual convict was likely to harm the economy. King William&#x27;s War (1688–1697) (part of the Nine Years&#x27; War) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) adversely affected merchant shipping and hence transportation. In the post-war period there was more crime and hence potentially more executions, and something needed to be done. In the reigns of Queen Anne (1702–14) and George I (1714–27), transportation was not easily arranged, but imprisonment was not considered enough to punish hardened criminals or those who had committed capital offences, so transportation was the preferred punishment.

====Transportation Act 1717====
There were several obstacles to the use of transportation. In 1706 the reading test for claiming benefit of clergy was abolished (6 Ann. c. 9). This allowed judges to sentence &quot;clergyable&quot; offenders to a workhouse or a house of correction. But the punishments that then applied were not enough of a disincentive to commit crime: another solution was needed. The Transportation Act was introduced into the House of Commons in 1717 under the Whig government. It legitimised transportation as a direct sentence, thus simplifying the penal process.

Non-capital convicts (clergyable felons usually destined for branding on the thumb, and petty larceny convicts usually destined for public whipping) were directly sentenced to transportation to the American colonies for seven years. A sentence of fourteen years was imposed on prisoners guilty of capital offences pardoned by the king. Returning from the colonies before the stated period was a capital offence. The bill was introduced by William Thomson, the Solicitor General, who was &quot;the architect of the transportation policy&quot;. Thomson, a supporter of the Whigs, was Recorder of London and became a judge in 1729. He was a prominent sentencing officer at the Old Bailey and the man who gave important information about capital offenders to the cabinet.

One reason for the success of this Act was that transportation was financially costly. The system of sponsorship by merchants had to be improved. Initially the government rejected Thomson&#x27;s proposal to pay merchants to transport convicts, but three months after the first transportation sentences were pronounced at the Old Bailey, his suggestion was proposed again, and the Treasury contracted Jonathan Forward, a London merchant, for the transportation to the colonies. The business was entrusted to Forward in 1718: for each prisoner transported overseas, he was paid £3 (), rising to £5 in 1727 (). The Treasury also paid for the transportation of prisoners from the Home Counties.

The &quot;Felons&#x27; Act&quot; (as the Transportation Act was called) was printed and distributed in 1718, and in April twenty-seven men and women were sentenced to transportation. The Act led to significant changes: both petty and grand larceny were punished by transportation (seven years), and the sentence for any non-capital offence was at the judge&#x27;s discretion. In 1723 an Act was presented in Virginia to discourage transportation by establishing complex rules for the reception of prisoners, but the reluctance of colonies did not stop transportation.

In a few cases before 1734, the court changed sentences of transportation to sentences of branding on the thumb or whipping, by convicting the accused for lesser crimes than those of which they were accused. This manipulation phase came to an end in 1734. With the exception of those years, the Transportation Act led to a decrease in whipping of convicts, thus avoiding potentially inflammatory public displays. Clergyable discharge continued to be used when the accused could not be transported for reasons of age or infirmity.

====Women and children====
Penal transportation was not limited to men or even to adults. Men, women, and children were sentenced to transportation, but its implementation varied by sex and age. From 1660 to 1670, highway robbery, burglary, and horse theft were the offences most often punishable with transportation for men. In those years, five of the nine women who were transported after being sentenced to death were guilty of simple larceny, an offence for which benefit of clergy was not available for women until 1692. Also, merchants preferred young and able-bodied men for whom there was a demand in the colonies.

All these factors meant that most women and children were simply left in jail. Some magistrates supported a proposal to release women who could not be transported, but this solution was considered absurd: this caused the Lords Justices to order that no distinction be made between men and women. Women were sent to the Leeward Islands, the only colony that accepted them, and the government had to pay to send them overseas. In 1696 Jamaica refused to welcome a group of prisoners because most of them were women; Barbados similarly accepted convicts but not &quot;women, children nor other infirm persons&quot;.

Thanks to transportation, the number of men whipped and released diminished, but whipping and discharge were chosen more often for women. The reverse was true when women were sentenced for a capital offence, but actually served a lesser sentence due to a manipulation of the penal system: one advantage of this sentence was that they could be discharged thanks to benefit of clergy while men were whipped. Women with young children were also supported since transportation unavoidably separated them. The facts and numbers revealed how transportation was less frequently applied to women and children because they were usually guilty of minor crimes and they were considered a minimal threat to the community.

==== The end of transportation====
The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) halted transportation to America. Parliament claimed that &quot;the transportation of convicts to his Majesty&#x27;s colonies and plantations in America ... is found to be attended with various inconveniences, particularly by depriving this kingdom of many subjects whose labour might be useful to the community, and who, by proper care and correction, might be reclaimed from their evil course&quot;; they then passed the Criminal Law Act 1776 (16 Geo. 3. c. 43) &quot;An act to authorize ... the punishment by hard labour of offenders who, for certain crimes, are or shall become liable to be transported to any of his Majesty&#x27;s colonies and plantations.&quot;


For the ensuing decade, men were instead sentenced to hard labour and women were imprisoned. Finding alternative locations to send convicts was not easy, and the act was extended twice by the Criminal Law Act 1778 (18 Geo. 3. c. 62) and the Criminal Law Act 1779 (19 Geo. 3. c. 54).

This resulted in a 1779 inquiry by a parliamentary committee on the entire subject of transportation and punishment; initially the Penitentiary Act 1779 was passed, introducing a policy of state prisons as a measure to reform the system of overcrowded prison hulks that had developed, but no prisons were ever built as a result of the act. The Transportation, etc. Act 1784 (24 Geo. 3. Sess. 2. c. 56) and the Transportation, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3. c. 46) also resulted to help alleviate overcrowding. Both acts empowered the Crown to appoint certain places within his dominions, or outside them, as the destination for transported criminals; the acts would move convicts around the country as needed for labour, or where they could be utilized and accommodated.

The overcrowding situation and the resumption of transportation would be initially resolved by Orders in Council on 6 December 1786, by the decision to establish a penal colony in New South Wales, on land previously claimed for Britain in 1770, but as yet not settled by Britain or any other European power. The British policy toward Australia, specifically for use as a penal colony, within their overall plans to populate and colonise the continent, would differentiate it from America, where the use of convicts was only a minor adjunct to its overall policy. In 1787, when transportation resumed to the chosen Australian colonies, the far greater distance added to the terrible experience of exile, and it was considered more severe than the methods of imprisonment employed for the previous decade. The Transportation Act 1790 (30 Geo. 3. c. 47) officially enacted the previous orders in council into law, stating &quot;his Majesty hath declared and appointed... that the eastern coast of New South Wales, and the islands thereunto adjacent, should be the place or places beyond the seas to which certain felons, and other offenders, should be conveyed and transported ... or other places&quot;. The act also gave &quot;authority to remit or shorten the time or term&quot; of the sentence &quot;in cases where it shall appear that such felons, or other offenders, are proper objects of the royal mercy&quot;

At the beginning of the 19th century, transportation for life became the maximum penalty for several offences which had previously been punishable by death. With complaints starting in the 1830s, sentences of transportation became less common in 1840 since the system was perceived to be a failure: crime continued at high levels, people were not dissuaded from committing felonies, and the conditions of convicts in the colonies were inhumane. Although a concerted programme of prison building ensued, the Short Titles Act 1896 lists seven other laws relating to penal transportation in the first half of the 19th century.

The system of criminal punishment by transportation, as it had developed over nearly 150 years, was officially ended in Britain in the 1850s, when that sentence was substituted by imprisonment with penal servitude, and intended to punish. The Penal Servitude Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 99), long titled &quot;An Act to substitute, in certain Cases, other Punishment in lieu of Transportation,&quot; enacted that with judicial discretion, lesser felonies, those subject to transportation for less than 14 years, could be sentenced to imprisonment with labour for a specific term. To provide confinement facilities, the general change in sentencing was passed in conjunction with the Convict Prisons Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 121), long titled &quot;An Act for providing Places of Confinement in England or Wales for Female Offenders under Sentence or Order of Transportation.&quot; The Penal Servitude Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 3) ended the sentence of transportation in virtually all cases, with the terms of sentence initially being of the same duration as transportation. While transport was greatly reduced following enactment of the 1857 act, the last convicts sentenced to transportation arrived in Western Australia in 1868. During the 80 years of its use to Australia, the number of transported convicts totalled about 162,000 men and women. Over time the alternative terms of imprisonment would be somewhat reduced from their terms of transportation.

===Transportation locations===
====Transportation to North America====

From the early 1600s until the American Revolution of 1776, the British colonies in North America received transported British criminals. Destinations were the island colonies of the West Indies and the mainland colonies that became the United States of America.

In the 17th century transportation was carried out at the expense of the convicts or the shipowners. The Transportation Act 1717 allowed courts to sentence convicts to seven years&#x27; transportation to America. In 1720, an extension authorized payments by the Crown to merchants contracted to take the convicts to America. The Transportation Act made returning from transportation a capital offence. The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified: John Dunmore Lang has estimated 50,000, and Thomas Keneally has proposed 120,000. Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province. Many prisoners were taken in battle from Ireland or Scotland and sold into indentured servitude, usually for a number of years. The American Revolution brought transportation to the North American mainland to an end. The remaining British colonies (in what is now Canada) were regarded as unsuitable for various reasons, including the possibility that transportation might increase dissatisfaction with British rule among settlers and/or the possibility of annexation by the United States – as well as the ease with which prisoners could escape across the border.

After the termination of transportation to North America, British prisons became overcrowded, and dilapidated ships moored in various ports were pressed into service as floating gaols known as &quot;hulks&quot;. Following an 18th-century experiment in transporting convicted prisoners to Cape Coast Castle (modern Ghana) and the Gorée (Senegal) in West Africa, British authorities turned their attention to New South Wales (in what would become Australia).

From the 1820s until the 1860s, convicts were sent to the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda (part of British North America) to work on the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard and other defence works, including at the East End of the archipelago, where they were accommodated aboard the hulk of HMS &quot;Thames&quot; at an area still known as &quot;Convict Bay&quot;, at St. George&#x27;s town.

====Transportation to Australia====


In 1787, the First Fleet, a group of convict ships departed from England to establish the first colonial settlement in Australia, as a penal colony. The First Fleet included boats containing food and animals from London. The ships and boats of the fleet would explore the coast of Australia by sailing all around it looking for suitable farming land and resources. The fleet arrived at Botany Bay, Sydney on 18 January 1788, then moved to Sydney Cove (modern-day Circular Quay) and established the first permanent European settlement in Australia. This marked the beginning of the European colonisation of Australia.

Violent conflict on the Australian frontier between indigenous Australians and the colonists began only months after the First Fleet landed, lasting over a century. Convicts forced to work in the bush on the frontier were sometimes the victims of indigenous attacks, while convicts and ex-convicts also attacked indigenous people in some instances, such as the Myall Creek Massacre. In the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars, a group of Irish convicts joined the Aboriginal coalition of Eora, Gandangara, Dharug and Tharawal nations in their fight against the colonists.

Norfolk Island, east of the Australian mainland, was a convict penal settlement from 1788 to 1794, and again from 1824 to 1847. In 1803, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (modern-day Tasmania) was also settled as a penal colony, followed by the Moreton Bay Settlement (modern Brisbane, Queensland) in 1824. The other Australian colonies were established as &quot;free settlements&quot;, as non-convict colonies were known. However, the Swan River Colony (Western Australia) accepted transportation from England and Ireland in 1851, to resolve a long-standing labour shortage.

Two penal settlements were established near modern-day Melbourne in Victoria but both were abandoned shortly after. Later, a free settlement was established and this settlement later accepted some convict transportation.

Until the massive influx of immigrants during the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s, free settlers had been outnumbered by penal convicts and their descendants. However, compared to the British American colonies, Australia received a larger number of convicts.

Convicts were generally treated harshly, forced to work against their will, often doing hard physical labour and dangerous jobs. In some cases they were cuffed and chained in work gangs. The majority of convicts were men, although a significant portion were women. Some were as young as 10 when convicted and transported to Australia. Most were guilty of relatively minor crimes like theft of food/clothes/small items, but some were convicted of serious crimes like rape or murder. Convict status was not inherited by children, and convicts were generally freed after serving their sentence, although many died during transportation or during their sentence.

Convict assignment (sending convicts to work for private individuals) occurred in all penal colonies aside from Western Australia, and can be compared with the practice of convict leasing in the United States.

Transportation from Great Britain and Ireland ended at different times in different colonies, with the last being in 1868, although it had become uncommon several years earlier thanks to the loosening of laws in Britain, changing sentiment in Australia, and groups such as the Anti-Transportation League.

In 2015, an estimated 20% of the Australian population had convict ancestry. In 2013, an estimated 30% of the Australian population (about 7 million) had Irish ancestry – the highest percentage outside of Ireland – thanks partially to historical convict transportation.

====Transportation from British India====

In British India – including the province of Burma (now Myanmar) and the port of Karachi (now part of Pakistan) – Indian independence activists were penally transported to the Andaman Islands. A penal colony was established there in 1857 with prisoners from the Indian Rebellion of 1857. As the Indian independence movement swelled, so did the number of prisoners who were penally transported.

The Cellular Jail in Port Blair, South Andaman Island, also called Kālā Pānī or Kalapani (Hindi for black waters), was constructed between 1896 and 1906 as a high-security prison with 698 individual cells for solitary confinement. Surviving prisoners were repatriated in 1937. The penal settlement was shut down in 1945. An estimated 80,000 political prisoners were transported to the Cellular Jail which became known for its harsh conditions, including forced labor; prisoners who went on hunger strikes were frequently force-fed.

==France==
France transported convicts to Devil&#x27;s Island and New Caledonia in the 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries. Devil&#x27;s Island, a French penal colony in Guiana, was used for transportation from 1852 to 1953. New Caledonia became a French penal colony from the 1860s until the end of the transportations in 1897; about 22,000 criminals and political prisoners (most notably Communards) were sent to New Caledonia.

Henri Charrière (16 November 1906  – 29 July 1973) was a French writer, convicted in 1931 as a murderer by the French courts and pardoned in 1970. He wrote the novel &quot;Papillon&quot;, a semi-autobiographical novel of his incarceration in and escape from a penal colony in French Guiana. 

The most significant individual transported prisoner is probably French army officer Alfred Dreyfus, wrongly convicted of treason in a trial in 1894, held in an atmosphere of antisemitism. He was sent to Devil&#x27;s Island. The case became a cause célèbre known as the Dreyfus Affair, and Dreyfus was fully exonerated in 1906.

==Soviet Union==

Unlike normal penal transportation, many Soviet people were transported as criminals in forms of deportation being proclaimed as enemies of people in a form of collective punishment. During the Second World War, the Soviet Union transported up to 1.9 million people from its western republics to Siberia and the Central Asian republics of the Union. Most were persons accused of treasonous collaboration with Nazi Germany, or of Anti-Soviet rebellion. Following death of Joseph Stalin, most of them were rehabilitated. Populations targeted included Volga Germans, Chechens, and Caucasian Turkic populations. The transportations had a twofold objective: to remove potential liabilities from the warfront, and to provide human capital for the settlement and industrialization of the largely underpopulated eastern regions. The policy continued until February 1956, when Nikita Khrushchev in his speech, &quot;On the Personality Cult and Its Consequences&quot;, condemned the transportation as a violation of Leninist principles. Whilst the policy itself was rescinded, the transported populations did not begin to return to their original metropoles until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991.

== Modern Russia ==
The Russian government today still sends their convicts and political prisoners to prisons that echo those of the Soviet Union. The journey to these prisons and labor camps is long and arduous. 

In many cases, the Russian penitentiary system utilizes special cars. These cars contain five large compartments and three smaller compartments. The larger car is 3.5 meters squared. The size of the larger car is approximately the same as normal Russian railcar spaces. The larger compartments have six and a half individual sleeping spaces. There are three bunks on each wall and a half bunk that goes between the two middle bunks. The half bunk is not full sized and prevents prisoners from standing up in the car. For food, prisoners are given dehydrated food three times a day and limited amounts of hot water to rehydrate their meals. Bedding is not provided nor are mattresses. During transit, prisoners do not have access to proper medical treatment. The medication that a prisoner would normally take is carried by guards. Transportation routes are often cyclical and prisoners do not know where they are going. This sense of unease and unknowing has been known to increase feelings of isolation. This process can take 3–5 hours which further prolongs travel time. Prisoners have very limited access to toilets while on the trains, about every five to six hours. While the trains are stationary they have no access at all. This can be very difficult as trains often are kept at stations or train depots for extended periods of time. 

While traveling to and from train stations, prisoners are transported in vans. While the time spent in vans is usually shorter than the time spent in trains, the conditions are still quite bad. The vans normally have two larger compartments that can fit 10 prisoners. Within the compartments there is a smaller compartment that is used to keep &quot;at risk&quot; prisoners safe. The smaller compartment is known as a stakan and is smaller than 0.5 meter squared. 

In addition to poor transit conditions, prisoners are severely limited in their communication with the outside world. Prisoners are denied the right to communicate with their lawyers and families. This can be difficult for their families because they do not know where the prisoner is or what has happened to them.

== In popular culture ==

===Performing arts===

Penal transportation is a feature of many broadsides, a new type of folk song that developed in eighteenth-century England. A number of these transportation ballads have been collected from traditional singers. Examples include &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land,&quot; &quot;The Black Velvet Band,&quot; &quot;The Peeler and the Goat&quot;, and &quot;The Fields of Athenry.&quot;

Timberlake Wertenbaker&#x27;s play &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; is set in 1780s in the first Australian penal colony. In the 1988 play, convicts and Royal Marines arrive aboard a First Fleet ship and settle New South Wales. Convicts and guards interact as they rehearse a theatre production, which the governor had suggested as an alternate form of entertainment instead of watching public hangings.

===Literature===

One of the key characters in Charles Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Pip helps him in the opening pages of the novel. Magwitch, who had been apprehended shortly after the young Pip had helped him, was thereafter sentenced to transportation for life to New South Wales in Australia. While so exiled, he earned the fortune that he later would use to help Pip. Further, it was Magwitch&#x27;s desire to see the &quot;gentleman&quot; that Pip had become that motivated him to illegally return to England, which ultimately led to his arrest and death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; was published in serial form in 1860–1861. In Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, the Artful Dodger is convicted and transported to Australia.

&quot;My Transportation for Life&quot;, Indian freedom fighter Veer Savarkar&#x27;s memoir of his imprisonment, is set in the British Cellular Jail in the Andaman Islands. Savarkar was imprisoned there from 1911 to 1921.

Franz Kafka&#x27;s story &quot;In der Strafkolonie&quot; (&quot;In the Penal Colony&quot;), published in 1919, was set in an unidentified penal settlement where condemned prisoners were executed by a brutal machine. The work was later adapted for several other media, including an opera by Philip Glass.

The novel &quot;Papillon&quot; tells the story of Henri Charrière, a French man convicted of murder in 1931 and exiled to the French Guiana penal colony on Devil&#x27;s Island. A film adaptation of the book was made in 1973, starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.

The British author W. Somerset Maugham set several stories in the French Caribbean penal colonies. In 1935 he had stayed at Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni in French Guiana. His 1939 novel &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; and two short stories in 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Mixture as Before&quot; were set there, although he &quot;ignored the brutal punishments and painted a pleasant picture of the infamous colony.&quot;

Penal transportation, typically to other planets, sometimes appears in works of science fiction. A classic example is &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; by Robert Heinlein (1966), in which convicts and political dissidents are transported to lunar colonies in order to grow food for Earth. In Heinlein&#x27;s book, a sentence of lunar transportation is necessarily permanent, as the long-term physiological effects of the moon&#x27;s weak surface gravity (about one-sixth that of Earth) leave &quot;loonies&quot; unable to return safely to Earth.

<text>The Jewish Agency for Israel (), formerly known as the Jewish Agency for Palestine, is the largest Jewish non-profit organization in the world. It was established in 1929 as the operative branch of the World Zionist Organization (WZO).

As an organization, it encourages immigration of Jews in diaspora to the Land of Israel, and oversees their integration with the State of Israel. Since 1948, the Jewish Agency claims to have brought 3 million immigrants to Israel, where it offers them transitional housing in &quot;absorption centers&quot; throughout the country. David Ben-Gurion served as its chairman of the executive committee from 1935, and in this capacity on 14 May 1948, he proclaimed Israel&#x27;s independence, following which he served as the first Israeli prime minister. In the years preceding the founding of Israel, the Jewish Agency oversaw the establishment of about 1,000 towns and villages in the British Mandate of Palestine. The organization serves as the main link between Israel and Jewish communities around the world.

By law, the Jewish Agency is a parastatal organization, but does not receive core funding from the Israeli government. The Jewish Agency is funded by the Jewish Federations of North America (JFNA), Keren Hayesod, major Jewish communities and federations, and foundations and donors from Israel and around the world. In 2008, the Jewish Agency won the Israel Prize for its historical contribution to Israel and to the Jewish community worldwide.

==History==

=== Name ===
Established as the (of the Zionist Organization) in 1908, the organization became the Zionist Commission, later Palestine Zionist Executive, which was designated in 1929 as the &quot;Jewish agency&quot; provided for in the League of Nations&#x27; Palestine Mandate and was thus again renamed as The Jewish Agency for Palestine. After the establishment of the State it received its current name, The Jewish Agency for Israel.

=== 1908–1928: Beginnings as an arm of the World Zionist Organization ===
The Jewish Agency began as the Palestine Office (Hebrew: המשרד הארץ-ישראלי, &quot;HaMisrad HaEretz Yisraeli&quot;; ), founded in Jaffa in 1908, as the operational branch of the Zionist Organization (ZO) in Ottoman-controlled Palestine under the leadership of Arthur Ruppin. The main tasks of the Palestine Office were to represent the Jews of Palestine in dealings with the Turkish sultan and other foreign dignitaries, to aid Jewish immigration, and to buy land for Jews to settle in.
The Palestine Office was established under the inspiration of Theodor Herzl&#x27;s vision for a solution to &quot;the Jewish question&quot;: the issue of anti-Semitism and the place of Jews in the world. In his pamphlet &quot;The Jewish State,&quot; Herzl envisioned the Jewish people settled as an independent nation on its own land, taking its place among the other nation-states of the world. The Palestine Office, which eventually became the Jewish Agency, was based upon Herzl&#x27;s organizational ideas for how to bring a Jewish state into being.

The influx of Jews to Palestine on the Second Aliyah (1904–1914) made the purchase of land particularly urgent. With the aid of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), the Palestine Office bought land for newcomers in two locations: Chavat Kinneret (near the Sea of Galilee), and Kibbutz Ruhama (near Sderot of today). Kibbutz Ruhama was specifically designated for Russian Jews from the Second Aliyah. Over the following decades, the Palestine Office established hundreds more &quot;moshavim &quot;and kibbutzim throughout Palestine. The Palestine Office continued to purchase land together with JNF (In Hebrew: &quot;Keren Kayemet L&#x27;Yisrael&quot;, KKL).

With the outbreak of World War I, the anticipated disintegration of the Ottoman Empire raised hopes among Zionists for increased Jewish immigration and eventual sovereignty in Palestine. In 1918, the United Kingdom conquered the region and it fell under British military rule.

Following the promulgation of the pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration, Dr. Chaim Weizmann, president of the British Zionist Federation formed the Zionist Commission in March 1918 to go to Palestine and make recommendations to the British government. The Commission reached Palestine on 14 April 1918 and proceeded to study conditions and to report to the British government, and was active in promoting Zionist objectives in Palestine. Weizmann was instrumental in restructuring the ZO&#x27;s Palestine office into departments for agriculture, settlement, education, land, finance, immigration, and statistics. The Palestine Office was merged into the Zionist Commission, headed by Chaim Weizmann.

On 25 April 1920, the Principal Allied Powers agreed at the San Remo conference to allocate the Ottoman territories to the victorious powers and assigned Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq as Mandates to Britain, with the Balfour Declaration being incorporated into the Palestine Mandate. The League of Nations formally approved these mandates in 1922. Article 4 of the Mandate provided for &quot;the recognition of an appropriate Jewish agency as a public body for the purpose of advising and co-operating with the Administration of Palestine in such economic, social and other matters as may affect the establishment of the Jewish National Home and the interests of the Jewish population of Palestine.&quot; The ZO leaders had contributed to the drafting of the Mandate. In November 1921, the Zionist Commission became the Palestine Zionist Executive and was designated as the Jewish agency for Palestine for the purpose of Article 4 of the Palestine Mandate.

In 1921 Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky was elected to the executive but he resigned in 1923, accusing Weizmann of not being vigorous enough with the Mandatory Government. Other issues between the Revisionists and the agency were the distribution of entry permits, Weizmann&#x27;s support for the Zionist Labour Movement, and the proposal to expand the agency. The Revisionists broke completely with agency in 1935, but rejoined ZO in 1947. In 1951 the ZO/JA included all Zionist organizations except Herut.
The Palestine Zionist Executive was charged with facilitating Jewish immigration to Palestine, land purchase, and planning the general policies of the Zionist leadership. It ran schools and hospitals, and formed a defence force, the Haganah. Chaim Weizmann was the leader of both the World Zionist Organization and the Palestine Zionist Executive until 1929. The arrangement enabled the ZO to issue entry permits to new immigrants.

=== Jewish Agency for Palestine 1929–1948 ===
==== Non-Zionists representation ====
In 1929, the Palestine Zionist Executive was renamed, restructured and officially inaugurated as The Jewish Agency for Palestine by the 16th Zionist Congress, held in Zürich, Switzerland. The new body was larger and included a number of Jewish non-Zionist individuals and organizations, who were interested in Jewish settlement in Palestine. They were philanthropic rather than political, and many opposed talk of a Jewish State. With this broader Jewish representation, the Jewish Agency for Palestine was recognized by the British in 1930, in lieu of the Zionist Organization, as the appropriate Jewish agency under the terms of the Mandate. The 16th Zionist Congress determined that in the event of the future dissolution of the agency, the World Zionist Organization would replace it as representative of the Jews for the purpose of the Mandate.

There was strong opposition within the ZO when the idea of enlargement of the board of governors of the Jewish Agency was first raised in 1924 to include non-Zionist Jews, and the idea was accepted by the Zionist Congress only in 1927.

Even though non-Zionists took part in the agency, it was still closely tied to the Zionist Organization. The president of the ZO served as the chair of the Executive Council and the Assembly of the Jewish Agency, and half of the members of the agency&#x27;s governing bodies were chosen by the ZO, ensuring a unified policy and close cooperation between the two organizations. The change was Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s initiative and was established on the principle of parity between Zionist and non-Zionist Jews working together in the building of a Jewish national home.

Those participating included Sholem Asch, H.N. Bialik, Leon Blum, Albert Einstein, Immanuel Löw, Lord Melchett and Herbert Samuel. American non-Zionists received 44 of the 112 seats allotted to non-Zionists. The British Board of Deputies joined as a constituent body.

Weizmann was criticized for being too pro-British. When the 1930 White Paper was published recommending restricting Jewish immigration, his position became untenable and he resigned from the ZO and the Jewish Agency. He protested that the British had betrayed their commitment expressed in the Balfour Declaration and that he could no longer work with them. Nahum Sokolow, who had been elected to succeed Weizmann, remained in his position. Arthur Ruppin succeeded Sokolow as chairman of the Jewish Agency in 1933 and David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Shertok joined the executive. In 1935, Ben-Gurion was elected chairman of the agency to succeed Ruppin.

In 1937 The Peel Commission published its report into the disturbances of the year before. For the first time, partition and the setting up of a Jewish State was recommended. The 1937 Zionist Congress rejected the commission&#x27;s conclusions, a majority insisting that the Balfour Declaration referred to all of Palestine and Transjordan, but the executive was authorized to continue exploring what the &quot;precise terms&quot; were. This decision revealed differences within the Jewish Agency, with the non-Zionists disagreeing with the decision and some calling for a conference of Jews and Arabs.

In 1947 the last non-Zionist member of the Jewish Agency, Werner Senator, resigned and while the 50 percent participation of non-Zionists in the Agency before had not worked in practice, the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization now became de facto identical.

==== Organization ====

From 1929 to 1948, the Jewish Agency was organized into four departments: the Government Department (performing foreign relations on behalf of the Jewish community of Palestine); the Security Department; the Aliyah Department, and the Education Department. The Jewish Agency Executive included David Ben-Gurion as chairman, and Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon and Yitzhak Gruenbaum, among others.
The Jewish Agency was (and is still) housed in a fortress-like building in the Rehavia neighborhood of Jerusalem. The land for the Rehavia neighborhood had been purchased in 1922 by the Palestine Land Development Corporation, and construction of the Jewish Agency headquarters was paid for by the ZO. The three-winged structure with a large open courtyard was designed by Yochanan Rattner. Along with the Jewish Agency it also houses the headquarters of the JNF and Keren Hayesod-United Israel Appeal. 

====Bombing====
On March 11, 1948, a bomb planted in the courtyard of the building by Arab militants killed 13 and wounded many others. The Keren Hayesod wing was completely destroyed. Leib Yaffe, director-general of Keren Hayesod, was among those killed in the bombing.

The building continues to serve as the headquarters of the Jewish Agency as of 2019. Another building &quot;Kiriyat Moria&quot; is located in southern-east Jerusalem, Armon Hanatziv, Ha-Askan 3. The organization also has satellite sites worldwide.

==== Pre-state immigration and settlement 1934–1948 ====
Throughout the years 1934–1948, in a phenomenon known as the &quot;Ha&#x27;apala (&quot;ascension), the Jewish Agency facilitated clandestine immigration beyond the British quotas. In 1938 it established &quot;HaMosad LeAliyah Bet&quot;(, lit. &quot;Institution for Immigration B&quot;)&quot;, &quot;which took charge of the effort. Overall, in these years, the agency, in partnership with other organizations, helped over 150,000 people in their attempt to enter Palestine, organizing a total of 141 voyages on 116 ships. The potential immigrants were Jews fleeing the Holocaust and, after the war, refugees from displaced persons camps who sought a home in Palestine. Most of the Ma&#x27;apilim ships (of the Ha&#x27;apala movement) were intercepted by the British, but a few thousand Jews did manage to slip past the authorities. The operation as a whole also helped to unify the long-standing Jewish community in Palestine as well as the newcomer Jewish refugees from Europe.In these years The agency made use of the &quot;tower and stockade&quot; (Hebrew: ) method to establish dozens of new Jewish settlements literally overnight, without obtaining permission from the Mandate authorities. These settlements were built on land purchased by the JNF and relied on an Ottoman law stating that any building with a full roof could not be torn down.
In 1933 the Jewish Agency negotiated a Ha&#x27;avara (Transfer) Agreement with Nazi Germany under which approximately 50,000 German Jews were allowed to immigrate to Palestine and retain some of their assets as German export goods.

In 1943, the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Henrietta Szold joined Recha Freier in developing the Youth Aliyah program, which between 1933 and 1948 rescued more 5,000 young Jews from Europe, brought them to Palestine, and educated them in special boarding schools. According to Professor Dvora Hacohen, between 1933 and 2011 the Youth Aliyah movement helped over 300,000 young people make Aliyah.

When World War II broke out, the Jewish Agency established a committee to aid European Jewry by finding them entry permits to Palestine, sending them food, and maintaining contact. The agency also helped recruit 40,000 members of the Palestinian Jewish community (a full 8 percent of the Jewish population of Palestine) to be trained by the British military and aid in the Allies&#x27; struggle against the Nazis; most served in the Middle East and Africa, but some served behind enemy lines in Europe, among them a group of 32 parachutists that included Hannah Szenes. In total, 800 were killed in their efforts.

When World War II ended the Agency continued to aid illegal immigration to Palestine through &quot;HaMossad LeAliyah Bet&quot; in an effort known as the &quot;Bricha&quot;. Between 1945 and 1948 the Jewish Agency sent 66 ships of refugees to Palestine. Most were intercepted by British authorities, who placed the illegal immigrants, who had just survived the Holocaust, in detention camps in Palestine and later in Cyprus. Only with the establishment of the State of Israel were the detainees allowed to enter the country.

==== Resistance and formation of Israel&#x27;s first government ====

Frustrated with the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued anti-Zionist stance, the Jewish Agency helped put together an agreement signed by the Hagannah, the Irgun, and the Lehi to form a United Resistance Movement against the British. In 1946 British troops raided Jewish Agency headquarters as part of Operation Agatha, a broad effort to quash Jewish resistance in Palestine. Important figures in The Agency including Moshe Sharett, head of the agency&#x27;s political department, and Dov Yosef, member of the agency&#x27;s executive committee, were arrested and imprisoned in Latrun.

The United Nations recommended the partition of Palestine on 29 November 1947. Meanwhile, the Jewish Agency collaborated with the Jewish National Council to set up a People&#x27;s Council (&quot;Mo&#x27;ezet Ha&#x27;am)&quot; and National Administration (&quot;Minhelet Ha&#x27;am)&quot;. After the declaration of independence on 14 May 1948, these two bodies formed the provisional government of the State of Israel.

=== The Jewish Agency for Israel ===

==== Post-State immigration, settlement, and infrastructure ====
Following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Jewish Agency for Israel shifted its focus to facilitating economic development and absorbing immigrants. Organizationally, it changed its structure: The Aliyah Department remained, as well as the Education Department (which promoted Jewish and Zionist education in the diaspora), but the Security and Government Departments were replaced by the Department of Agriculture and Settlement, and by the Israel Department (supporting activities that help vulnerable populations within Israel).

The agency&#x27;s budget in 1948 was IL 32 million; its funding came from Keren Hayesod, the JNF, fund-raising drives, and loans.

In 1949, the Jewish Agency brought 239,000 Holocaust survivors, from DP camps in Europe and detention camps in Cyprus, to Israel. In the years following Israel&#x27;s founding, Jews in many Arab countries suffered from violence and persecution, and fled or were driven from their homes. The agency helped to airlift 49,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel on Operation Magic Carpet, and over the next few years brought hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees to Israel from Northern Africa, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran.

Between 1948 and 1952, about 700,000 immigrants arrived in the new state. The Jewish Agency helped these immigrants acclimate to Israel and begin to build new lives. It established schools to teach them Hebrew, beginning with Ulpan Etzion in 1949. (The first student to register for Ulpan Etzion was Ephraim Kishon.) It also provided them with food, housing, and vocational training. For a time the construction of new housing could not keep up with demand, and many of the new immigrants were placed in temporary &quot;ma&#x27;abarot&quot;, or transit camps.

In 1952 the &quot;Zionist Organization-Jewish Agency for Israel Status Law&quot; was passed by the Knesset formalizing the roles of each group. It was agreed that the WZO and the Jewish Agency would continue to supervise Aliyah, absorption, and settlement, while the state would handle all other matters previously dealt with by The agency including security, education, and employment. Article 4 of the Status Law stipulated that the World Zionist Organization (clarified in Article 3 as &quot;also the Jewish Agency&quot;) is an &quot;authorized agency&quot; of the State, establishing its ongoing parastatal rather than purely nongovernmental status.

In the early years of the state the Jewish Agency aided in the establishment of a variety of different institutions that developed the country&#x27;s economic and cultural infrastructure. These included El Al, the national airline; Binyanei HaUma, the national theater and cultural center; and museums, agricultural, and land development companies.

In the years after 1948, the Agency&#x27;s Department of Agricultural Settlement established an additional 480 new towns and villages throughout Israel. It provided them with equipment, livestock, irrigation infrastructure, and expert guidance. By the late 1960s these towns produced 70% of Israel&#x27;s total agricultural output.

The agency also focused its energies on Jews outside of Israel. The Department for Education and Culture in the Diaspora and the Department of Torah Education and Culture in the Diaspora were created to help replace the loss of centers of Jewish learning destroyed by the Holocaust. They trained Hebrew teachers; sent Israelis abroad to supplement Diaspora schools, camps, and youth organizations; and trained cantors, (ritual slaughterers) and (ritual circumcisers) in Diaspora communities.

==== Immigration and absorption, 1967–1990s ====
Jewish pride and euphoria following Israel&#x27;s dramatic victory in the Six Day War of 1967 prompted a new wave of immigration. In order to aid in the absorption of this influx of immigrants, the Israeli government&#x27;s Ministry for Absorption was created in June 1968, taking over some aspects of absorption from The Agency and the ZO.

In the 1980s, the Jewish Agency began to bring the Ethiopian Jewish Community to Israel. On Operation Moses and Operation Joshua more than 8,000 immigrants were airlifted out of Ethiopia. In 1991 about 14,400 Ethiopian Jews were flown to Israel in the space of 36 hours on Operation Solomon. Since then, a steady trickle of immigrants have been brought to Israel from Ethiopia by the Jewish Agency. The agency has taken charge of housing them in absorption centers, teaching them Hebrew, helping them find employment and in general easing their integration into Israeli society. In 2013 most of the &quot;&quot;olim&quot;,&quot; or new immigrants, in absorption centers are from Ethiopia.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Russian and Eastern European Jews began to stream to Israel in the tens of thousands. In 1990, about 185,000 immigrants arrived from the FSU; in the following year, nearly 150,000 came; and for the rest of the decade a steady average of 60,000 immigrants from the region made their way to Israel every year. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, nearly a million Jews and their family members from the former Soviet Union have made Aliyah, presenting tremendous absorption challenges. The Jewish Agency has helped them to integrate through a variety of programs including Hebrew language instruction, placement in absorption centers, and job training.

==== Program expansion, 1990s–today ====
In 1994, the Jewish Agency, together with the United Jewish Communities and Keren Hayesod-United Israel Appeal, established Partnership 2000. Now known as Partnership2Gether or P2G, the program connects 45 Israeli communities with over 500 Jewish communities around the globe in a &quot;sister city&quot;-style network. Diaspora participants travel to Israel and vice versa, and are hosted by their partner communities; schools are connected through the Global Twinning Network; global Jewish communities support loan funds helping entrepreneurs and small business owners in their partner cities; and young Jewish adults in Israel on long-term programs meet with their Israeli peers for dialogue and workshops.

The Jewish Agency provides Jewish communities outside Israel a continuum of programming to &quot;bring Israel&quot; to local worldwide Jewish communities. They do this in part through &quot;&quot;shlichim&quot;,&quot; or emissaries. &quot;Shlichim&quot; are Israeli educators or cultural ambassadors, who spend an extended period of time (2 months to 5 years) abroad to &quot;bring Israel&quot; to the community. &quot;Shlichim&quot; are also posted at college campuses in organizations like or active in youth organizations.

Other Jewish Agency-sponsored programs that are instrumental in inspiring Jewish youth with a connection to Israel are &quot;Israel Experiences&quot; (educational visits to Israel) such as Taglit-Birthright Israel, a 10-day visit to Israel provided free-of-charge to young Jewish adults. The Jewish Agency is an important organizational partner in the Taglit-Birthright initiative.

In 2004, the Jewish Agency and the Government of Israel together created (and continue to co-sponsor as of 2016) Masa Israel Journey, which provides stipends to young Jews between the ages of 18 and 30 who would like to study, volunteer, or perform internships in Israel for a period of 5–12 months.

During this period, the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Israel Department focused (and continues to focus) on strengthening Israel&#x27;s periphery, namely the Galilee region in the north and the Negev in the South. The emergence of the high-tech industry in Israel created a significant socio-economic disparity between the center of country and the outer regions. Thus, the Jewish Agency sought (and continues to seek) to &quot;lessen cultural and economic gaps.&quot;

For example, its Youth Futures program, founded in 2006, includes a holistic approach to dealing with at-risk youth in Israel: each child, referred to the program by a teacher or social worker, is connected to a &quot;Mentor&quot; who is responsible for connecting the child to resources and community services. The Jewish Agency is also a significant partner in the Net@ program offered by Cisco Systems. Program participants are Israeli high school students in socio-economically disadvantaged areas, who study the Cisco computer curriculum and earn certification as computer technicians; they also engage in volunteering and study democratic values.

In July 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Ministry of Justice took steps to stop the Jewish Agency for Israel from operating in Russia, claiming that the agency had broken Russian law regarding collecting, storing and transferring data. After the invasion started, there was a sharp increase in emigration from Russia to Israel.

== Governance ==
The Jewish Agency Executive is charged with administering the operations of the Jewish Agency, subject to the control of the board of governors. It has 26 members, of which 24 are chosen by the board of governors. The executive is composed in the following manner: 12 members designated by WZO and 12 members designated jointly by JFNA/UIA and Keren Hayesod. In addition, the World chairperson of Keren Hayesod and the chairperson of the JFNA Executive are ex-officio members in the executive. Doron Almog is the current chair. Yaakov Hagoel was serving as acting chairman since Isaac Herzog vacated the position upon becoming Israel&#x27;s 11th president.

Over the years the executive board has included many prominent members of Israeli society. Some of the famous Israelis who have served on the board include: M. D. Eder – 1922; Frederick Kisch – 1922–31; Haim Arlosoroff – 1931–33; Moshe Shertok – 1933–48; Arthur Ruppin – 1933–35; David Ben-Gurion (Chairman of the Executive) – 1935–48.

The board of governors, which meets not less than three times a year, is the central policy-making body of the Jewish Agency. The 120 governors play a crucial role in the governance of the agency in overseeing budgets and operations and in recommending policy to the agency. Members of the board are elected to serve for a two-year term in the following manner: 60 of the members (50 percent) are designated by WZO; 36 of the members (30 percent) are designated by JFNA/UIA; 24 members (20 percent) are designated by Keren Hayesod. The board of governors determines policy of the Jewish Agency for Israel and manages, supervises, controls, and directs its operations and activities. The current chairperson of the board of governors, as of July 2014, is Mr. Charles (Chuck) Horowitz Ratner.
The Assembly, which meets at least once every two years, is the supreme governing body of the Jewish Agency. It has 518 delegates who are elected in the following manner: 259 of the members (50 percent) are designated by the WZO; 155 of the members (30 percent) are designated by the Jewish Federations of North America/United Israel Appeal (JFNA/UIA); and 104 of the members (20 percent) are designated by Keren Hayesod. The Assembly is responsible for determining basic policies and goals of the Jewish Agency; receiving and reviewing reports from the board of governors; making recommendations on major issues; and adopting resolutions on the above.

The director general is responsible, under the direction of the chairperson of the executive, for the implementation of policies established by the assembly, the board of governors and the executive. In addition, he/she is responsible for all operations and administration of the Jewish Agency, including implementation of long-term strategic goals. The current director general is Amira Ahronoviz, the first woman to hold the position.

== Funding and budget ==
The Jewish Agency is funded by the Jewish Federations of North America, Keren Hayesod, major Jewish communities and federations, and foundations and donors from Israel and around the world.

Due to the volatile U.S. dollar, the global economic crisis and the Madoff scandal, the Jewish Agency for Israel was forced to make significant cuts to its budget. The board of governors voted to cut $45 million in November 2008 and an additional $26 million at the February 2009 meeting.

The organization&#x27;s total operating budget in 2013 was US$355,833,000, and its projected operating budget for 2014 was US$369,206,000. Its operating budget for 2019 is US$379,807,000.

Jewish Agency International Development, the organization&#x27;s main fundraising arm in North America, is a registered 501(c)(3) organization.

== Current programs ==
As of 2019, the Jewish Agency sponsors dozens of programs that connect Jews to Israel and to each other. The agency organizes the programs into four different categories:

* Connecting young Jews to Israel and their Jewish identity (Jewish and Zionist education in the Jewish diaspora)
* Connecting young Israelis to the Jewish people and their Jewish identity
* Aliyah and absorption
* Supporting vulnerable populations in Israel

=== Youth connections ===

==== Israel experiences ====
The Israel Experience programs bring young Jews from around the globe to Israel to get to know the country and deepen their Jewish identities.
* Taglit-Birthright Israel provides ten-day educational trips to Israel, Jerusalem and the Golan Heights for Jews ages 18 to 26 from around the world, completely free of charge. The Jewish Agency is the largest organizational partner in the initiative and is directly involved in bringing thousands of participants on Taglit-Birthright each year, with a special focus on facilitating Taglit-Birthright experiences for participants from the United States and from the former Soviet Union (FSU).
* Masa Israel Journey is a public-service organization founded in 2004 by the Government of Israel&#x27;s Office of the Prime Minister, together with the Jewish Agency. It includes programs in Israel for Jews aged 18–30, including study programs, service programs, and career development. Programs last from 2–12 months. In 2018 it provided scholarships to nearly 9,800 participants. Masa also performs outreach and operates alumni activities.
* Israel Tech Challenge is a partnership of the Jewish Agency with the National Cyber Bureau and other partners and donors. It offers trips to Israel of varying lengths for students and young professionals (aged 18–30) with knowledge in the field of computer science and programming. The programs offer visits with Israeli hi-tech professionals and academics, along with experience or training in coding, cyber security and/or data science.
*Machon Le Madrichim trains Jewish counselors from Zionist youth movements around the world in Israel, to give them tools for running educational Zionist programs in their home communities when they return. It was founded in 1946 by the World Zionist Organization. As of 2018, it had 17,000 alumni from around the world. Today the Machon trains several hundred young leaders each year.
* Na&#x27;ale allows Jewish teenagers from the diaspora to study in Israel and earn a high school diploma. Students start the program in ninth or tenth grade and graduate after the twelfth grade with a full Israeli matriculation certificate (&quot;bagrut&quot;). During the first year, students follow an intensive Hebrew-language program so that they become able to speak, read and write in Hebrew. The program is fully subsidized by the Israeli government. The Na&#x27;ale scholarship includes: fully subsidized tuition, free ticket to Israel, room and board, health insurance, trips, and extra curricular activities. Na&#x27;ale offers a variety of schools all over Israel from which candidates may choose, including secular, national religious, ultra-orthodox, kibbutz, and urban boarding schools. The Jewish Agency is involved in recruitment in the former Soviet Union.
* &quot;Students before Parents&quot; (&quot;&quot;, abbreviated as , SELA, Selah), a program for young immigrants from the countries of the former Soviet Union aimed at the preparation to the education in Israel, bringing young Jews to Israel in hopes that their families follow them. The program includes learning Hebrew, English, mathematics, and Jewish history and tradition.

==== Jewish and Zionist education outside Israel ====
In its mission to strengthen the ties between Israel and worldwide Jewry and to promote Jewish culture and identity, the Jewish Agency sends out &quot;shlichim&quot;, or emissaries, to Jewish communities across the globe; partners with Israel and Diaspora communities, and operates and/or funds Jewish educational programs. It also supports Jewish inclusion and diversity programs.

*Jewish Agency Israel Fellows are Israeli young adults who have completed army service and university study. These &quot;Campus Shlichim&quot; travel for two years university campuses with the goal of empowering student leadership and promoting positive engagement with Israel. According to the Jewish Agency, the aims of an Israel Fellow are to &quot;create an ongoing Israel presence for Jewish students and the broader community . . . . partner with student organizations, campus study abroad offices, Jewish and Israel studies departments, local Jewish federations, Israeli consulates, and Jewish Community Centers ... [and] follow through with Taglit-Birthright trip alumni via one-on-one meetings and special programs and events to keep them active and encourage them to continue their Jewish journeys while in college.&quot;
*Shlichim (Jewish Agency &quot;emissaries&quot;) are active in communal organizations, Jewish schools, community centers, synagogues and youth movements. There are also summer Shlichim who serve in Jewish summer camps. They serve as a central resource for Israel education in the local community. In the 2017–18 program year, the Jewish Agency sent 1,388 short-term emissaries to summer camps and other programs, and around 400 long-term emissaries to countries around the world (not including the Israel Fellows).
*Programs for Russian-speaking Jewry: The organization has developed special outreach to Russian Jewry, because they have largely been separated from Jewish communities even after the fall of the Soviet Union. Only an estimated 20 percent of the 800,000 Jews across former Soviet states are engaged in Jewish life. And Russian Jews who have emigrated to other countries have often been separated from Jewish community life. The agency runs programs for them (in the former Soviet Union, Germany, Austria and Israel) that fall are organized into four areas: (1) Camping, youth education, and counselor training (2) leadership training (3) visits to Israel (4) Focus on facilitation of Aliyah from the former Soviet Union and Germany.
*FSU Summer and Winter Camps introduce young Russian-speaking Jews in the former Soviet Union to their Jewish heritage. Staffed by trained local counselors and Russian-speaking Israeli counselors, participants are introduced to Jewish history, Jewish customs and practices, and Israel. The agency organizes counselors to follow up with attendees in year-round Jewish educational activities. In 2018, some 8,200 participants in the former Soviet Union attended sleepaway camps and 1,487 went to day camps.
*Partnership2Gether and the Global School Twinning Network: see below.
*The Emergency Assistance Fund provides for physical security improvements, such as video surveillance &amp; CCTV, alarms, locks, gates, and reinforced walls/doors/windows, at synagogues, Jewish community centers, schools, and camps so that Jewish communal life can continue in greater safety. Jewish institutions outside Israel and North America are eligible for assistance. The 2018 allocations totaled around $1.4 million: $781,000 to institutions in Europe, $423,000 to facilities in Latin America, $82,000 to those in the former Soviet Union, and $109,000 to the Middle East. As of the end of 2018, the fund has allocated over $11.5 million to hundreds of institutions in dozens of countries.

=== Aliyah ===

The Jewish Agency still brings thousands of Jews to move to Israel each year. In 2014, The agency helped a total of nearly 26,500 &quot;olim&quot; (immigrants) make Aliyah, the highest number in 13 years. They noted significant growth in immigration from Ukraine and France. The agency continues to support these &quot;olim&quot; as they integrate into Israeli society.

*Aliyah of Rescue is the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Aliyah infrastructure that brings Jews suffering persecution or economic distress to Israel. The services include covert operations to help Jews move out of Middle Eastern and North African countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations.
*Pre-Aliyah Services are provided by the Jewish Agency to prospective immigrants around the world. Agency &quot;shlichim&quot;, or emissaries, give guidance on issues such as education, housing, health and employment opportunities in Israel. For those who do not have an emissary nearby, The agency provides assistance online and on the phone through its Global Service Center. Additionally, The agency is responsible for verifying that each potential immigrant is eligible for Aliyah under Israel&#x27;s Law of Return and, once eligibility is proven, for facilitating the receipt of the Aliyah visa via the local Israeli embassy or consulate.
*Absorption Centers around the country offer temporary housing for new immigrants and provide space for Hebrew instruction, preparation for life and employment in Israel, events, activities and cultural presentations. 17 of The agency&#x27;s 22 Absorption Centers cater specifically to Ethiopian &quot;olim&quot; and provide services tailored to the needs of the Ethiopian community. The other five house immigrants from around the world, primarily the FSU, South America, and the Middle East.
*&quot;Ulpan&quot;: Intensive Hebrew language programs for new immigrants include five hours of immersive language instruction, five days a week, for five months. The programs are offered free of charge to all new immigrants. Ulpan instructors are certified by the Ministry of Education.
*Centers for Young Adults provide &quot;ulpan&quot; classes, accommodations and a range of services to ease absorption for &quot;olim &quot;ages 18–35. These centers include the Ulpan Etzion network for college graduates and young professionals; Beit Brodetzky in Tel Aviv and Ulpan Kinneret in Tiberias, for high school graduates looking for job or army preparation; and Kibbutz Ulpan, combining Hebrew instruction with volunteer work on ten different kibbutzim. It also includes Selah, a program for high school graduates from the Former Soviet Union, and TAKA, which combines &quot;ulpan &quot;studies with pre-academic preparatory courses for immigrants headed to Israeli colleges who wish to polish their skills.
*Wings encompasses an array of services including practical guidance and personal mentorship for young immigrants who join the IDF as lone soldiers, far from their families.

=== Supporting vulnerable populations in Israel ===
The Jewish Agency also helps vulnerable populations in Israel and around the world.
* Youth Futures is a community-based initiative for mentoring at-risk pre-teens and adolescents. Each Youth Futures &quot;mentor&quot; works with 16 at-risk children over the course of three years, teaching skills for academic improvement and social integration. In 2014–15, approximately 350 trained Youth Futures staff members worked with 5,000 children and teens, plus 7,000 of their family members, in 200 schools in 35 communities in Israel. In addition to secular and traditional Jews, Youth Futures serves Arab, Bedouin, Druze, and Ultra-Orthodox communities.
* Youth Villages provide safe, cost-effective boarding school settings for 850 young people ages 12 to 18 who have severe emotional, behavioral and family problems. The four Jewish Agency youth villages provide intensive, holistic services and help the youths succeed in and complete high school, and enter the Israeli army with their peers.
* Project TEN brings together young Israelis and their Jewish peers from across the globe to work on sustainable projects in developing regions. Participants spend three months working in onsite service projects in vulnerable communities. Project TEN is a service-learning program designed to build participants&#x27; Jewish identities while they serve others. In 2022, Project TEN runs volunteer centers in Winneba, Ghana; Oaxaca, Mexico; Gondar, Ethiopia; Kibbutz Harduf, Israel; and Mitzpe Ramon. In 2015 the program involved 200 volunteers around the world.
* Young Activism includes programs that train and support young-adult Israeli volunteers, who go on to create their own social entrepreneurship projects, thus widening the circles of influence. The Young Activism programs include (a) support for Young Communities, groups of idealistic young Israelis who commit to settling long-term in Israel&#x27;s high-need areas and creating programs that increase local quality of life. (b) Choosing Tomorrow, which encourages university students in Israel&#x27;s outlying areas to create young communities and settle long-term in the region (c) Ketzev, which provides extra training and mentoring to some of the young communities to help them build self-sustaining &quot;social entrepreneurship&quot; businesses, that provide cultural or educational benefits to customers. (d) Click, which provides microgrants to individual volunteers or very small groups, to help them launch small-scale local projects. (e) The Young Adults&#x27; Hub in Arad, where dozens of Israelis and Diaspora Jews receive subsidized housing in exchange for their volunteer activities for the city.
* Net@ gives high-performing teenagers an opportunity to rise above their families&#x27; socio-economic backgrounds by training them for four years in marketable computer skills, leading to certification as computer and network technicians through Cisco Systems. The program is in addition to the participants&#x27; high school course load and also increases their English comprehension skills. In 2014, around 1,100 teens participated in the program, and another 400 children participated in Net@ Junior.
* Loan funds assist entrepreneurs and business owners in Israel to open or expand their businesses, through loans with highly attractive conditions as well as comprehensive business guidance. The Jewish Agency acts as a partial guarantor for the loans, to support those businesses that otherwise would have a difficult time qualifying for loans or presenting the necessary collateral for them. The various funds have different eligibility criteria, with some focusing on stimulating the economy in specific regions of Israel, and others focusing on specific populations of business owners, such as Israeli Arabs, Ethiopian-Israelis, immigrants, etc.
* The Fund for Victims of Terror provides two forms of financial assistance to those who have been wounded, or had family members killed, in a terrorist attack or war against Israel. It provides immediate assistance in the 24–48 hours after the attack, and it provides subsidies for long-term rehabilitation needs. In 2014, the fund provided emergency grants to 120 families impacted by Operation Protective Edge, and more than 1 million shekels (around $250,000 according to the exchange rate at the time) to 80 families with long-term effects from Operation Pillar of Defense. 
* Amigour is a Jewish Agency subsidiary that provides housing for Israel&#x27;s elderly. In 2014 it operated 57 facilities that housed 7,500 seniors, mainly Holocaust survivors. Additionally, it operates 13,000 public housing apartments that provide government-subsidized housing to 40,000 single-parent families, elderly, and new immigrants.

== Services for Israeli Arabs and minorities ==
As part of its efforts to strengthen Israeli society and to support vulnerable populations in Israel, the Jewish Agency has, for many years, supported or operated programs that encourage co-existence between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs, and programs designed specifically to serve Israel&#x27;s non-Jewish citizens, and they continue to create new ones. Some of the programs:

* Youth Futures, the mentorship program for middle-school students, is active in 36 locations around Israel. Some localities served by Youth Futures are Jewish, while others are mixed and, in recent years, the Jewish Agency has begun to serve children and families living in completely non-Jewish locales: East Jerusalem (100% Arab participants), Tel Aviv-Yafo (32% of participants are Arab), Acco and Matte Asher (34%), Lod (57% Arab/Bedouin), Horfeish (100% Druze), and El Kassum (100% Bedouin).
* Choosing Tomorrow, one of The agency&#x27;s &quot;Young Activism&quot; social entrepreneurship training programs, includes three groups of Arab university and college students (total 40 students) who are being trained to create their own social-welfare programs that will specifically benefit their local (Arab) communities. These groups are in Be&#x27;er Sheva, the Jezre&#x27;el Valley, and a group at the Alkassemy Arab College. Additionally, Choosing Tomorrow groups in the Negev work to improve medical services to the Bedouin population, by teaching Arabic to local doctors and helping them understand and connect with Bedouin culture.
*Neve Midbar is a boarding school that develops leadership among teenage Bedouin boys.
* Net@ is a program supported by the Jewish Agency. In its chapters in Ramle, Nazareth, Acre, Jerusalem, and Tel Aviv-Yafo, Jewish and Arab teenagers study computers together, volunteer in community computer labs together, and serve as mentors together to junior-high school participants. In addition, Net@ has all-Arab chapters in Umm Al Fahm, Yirka, and Tira. 25% of all counselors in Net@ are Israeli Arab.

* Acharai Pre-Army Academy (&quot;Mechinah&quot;) includes a mixed Jewish-Druze group and a mixed Jewish-Christian group in which soon-to-be-enlisted young Israelis of both religions work together to volunteer, promote co-existence, and prepare for their IDF service.
* Atidim is a national Israeli program provides scholarships and educational activities to gifted students, funded in part by the Jewish Agency. Most programs serve both Jewish and non-Jewish students, and there are some programs dedicated specifically to the Arab sector. All told, in 2014 Atidim programs included more than 2,340 non-Jewish participants, including Druze, Bedouin, Arabs and other non-Jewish Israelis. Additionally the alumni association includes hundreds of Arab, Druze, and Bedouin graduates.
* Jewish Agency scholarship funds benefit Arab recipients as well as Jewish ones.
* Jewish Agency loan funds often help Israeli-Arab small business owners to receive bank loans at favorable rates. The nine different funds act as guarantors. One of the funds specifically aims to assist small business owners who are Arab, ultra-Orthodox, female, Ethiopian, or immigrants.

== Strategic plans ==

=== 2010 ===
At the February 2010 board of governors meeting, Natan Sharansky announced a shift in the priorities of the Jewish Agency from Aliyah to strengthening Jewish identity for young adults around the world.

From 1948 until 2009, the Jewish Agency was organized into departments: the Aliyah and Absorption department, which was responsible for the immigration and integration of Jews coming to Israel; the Education department, which worked to deepen the connection of Jews worldwide to Israel; and the Israel department, which focused on improving the lives of socio-economically vulnerable Israelis. (A fourth department, for Agriculture and Settlement, had been in operation starting in 1948, but had closed long before 2009.)

In order to increase efficiency, the Jewish Agency, under the leadership of its new chairman of the executive, Natan Sharansky, decided to restructure the organization. Along with the organizational restructuring came a new focus. As the first decade of the 21st century came to a close, The agency noted that most of global Jewry was now located in democratic, stable societies that were relatively friendly to Jewish residents. As &quot;Aliyah of Rescue&quot; became urgent for decreasing numbers of Jews, new challenges were arising for world Jewry, most notably, Agency leaders remarked, the need to engage young Jews in Jewish culture and to help Israeli Jews and those who live outside Israel to understand each other and feel connected to what they call the &quot;global Jewish family.&quot; While continuing &quot;Aliyah of Rescue&quot; operations, The agency decided to focus its primary energies on fostering a strong relationship between world Jewry and Israel, and on encouraging Aliyah based on a love for the country, what it calls &quot;Aliyah of Choice.&quot; Its main vehicle for doing so would be to bring Jews from around the world to Israel on short- and long-term tourist programs to allow them to get to know the country and to give Israelis the opportunity to get to know them and vice versa. Parallel to these efforts, The agency decided to increase its investment in strengthening Jewish communities around the globe. Its goals would be to grow local Jewish leadership, to strengthen Jewish identity, and to deepen the connection of communities worldwide to Israel and to the Jewish people as a whole.

=== 2019 ===
At the October 2019 board of governors meeting, which marked the 90th anniversary of the organization, the board passed a decision to somewhat shift the Jewish Agency&#x27;s areas of focus, in response to new critical challenges that had arisen for the Jewish people. Its &quot;renewed mission&quot; moving into its tenth decade focuses on three areas:

# Continuing to promote Aliyah and ensure Jewish safety: continuing to facilitate both Aliyah of Rescue and Aliyah of Choice; working with other organizations and communities in a common struggle against anti-Semitism and delegitimization of Israel.
# Connecting Jews worldwide to one another and to Israel: bridging the diversity of identities, interests and religious streams in the Jewish world; developing global Jewish leadership
# Advocacy and impact on behalf of world Jewry in Israel: bringing the diversity of voices in the Jewish world to Israeli policy makers and Israeli society at large; helping the Israeli public understand the diversity of Jewish life while building a personal commitment to the Jewish People as a whole; developing a new paradigm for the involvement of world Jewry in Israeli society.

== Awards and recognition ==
On May 8, 2008, at the Israeli government&#x27;s 60th Independence Day celebration, the Jewish Agency for Israel was awarded the Israel Prize for lifetime achievement &amp; special contribution to society and the State of Israel.

<text>My Family and Other Animals (1956) is an autobiographical book by British naturalist Gerald Durrell. It tells in an exaggerated and sometimes fictionalised way of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of Corfu between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell&#x27;s Corfu trilogy, which also includes &quot;Birds, Beasts, and Relatives&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Garden of the Gods&quot; (1978).

Durrell had already written several successful books about his trips collecting animals in the wild for zoos when he published &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; in 1956. Its comic exaggeration of the foibles of his family – including his eldest brother Lawrence Durrell, who became a celebrated novelist and poet – and his heartfelt appreciation of the natural world made it very successful. Durrell was able to found the Jersey Zoological Park (now known as the Durrell Wildlife Park) in the Channel Islands. He also became known as a novel-writer and television personality. His books helped stimulate the development of tourism in Corfu.

== Summary ==
The book is an autobiographical account of five years in the childhood of naturalist Gerald Durrell, aged 10 at the start of the saga, of his family, pets and life during a sojourn on Corfu. The book is divided into three sections, marking the three villas where the family lived on the island. Gerald is the youngest in a family consisting of their widowed mother, writer and eldest son Larry, the gun-mad Leslie, and diet-obsessed sister Margo together with Roger the dog. They are fiercely protected by their taxi-driver friend Spiro (Spiro &quot;Americano&quot; Hakiaopulos) and mentored by the polymath Dr. Theodore Stephanides who provides Gerald with his education in natural history. Other human characters, chiefly eccentric, include Gerald&#x27;s private tutors, the artistic and literary visitors Larry invites to stay, and the local people who befriend the family.

== Background ==
The book was written in 1955 in Bournemouth, where Durrell was recuperating from a severe attack of jaundice. Whereas Durrell often claimed to find writing a chore, this book was different: his first wife Jacquie recalled: &quot;Never have I known Gerry work as he did then; it seemed to pour out of him&quot;. Durrell maintained that &quot;he had started off like a good cook with three ingredients which, delicious alone, were even better in combination: namely, the spellbinding landscape of a Greek island before tourism succeeded in spoiling it for tourists; his discovery of and friendship with the wild denizens, both animal and Greek, of that island; and the eccentric conduct of all members of his family.&quot; The book was an instant success.

Although &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; is presented as autobiographical, the events described are not always true. In particular, Larry lived in another part of Corfu with his first wife Nancy Durrell, whom Gerald does not mention at all. The chronology of events as they occur in the book is also inaccurate, and the reason for the Durrells&#x27; departure from Corfu (imminent outbreak of World War II) is not given; instead, it is implied that the family returned to England for the sake of Gerald&#x27;s education.

However, the book does succeed in preserving the impressions of ten- to fourteen-year-old Gerald extremely vividly and with a great deal of light-hearted humour. Despite the omissions and inaccuracies, Lawrence Durrell commented: &quot;This is a very wicked, very funny, and I&#x27;m afraid rather truthful book – the best argument I know for keeping thirteen-year-olds at boarding-schools and not letting them hang about the house listening in to conversations of their elders and betters&quot;.

The book was first published by Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd in 1956, and in paperback by Penguin Books in 1959, and has remained in print ever since.

== Adaptations ==

=== Television and film ===

==== 1987 ====
In 1987, the book was made into a ten-part BBC television series, &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;, written by Charles Wood and directed by Peter Barber-Fleming. It starred Hannah Gordon as Louisa Durrell and Brian Blessed as Spiro Amerikanos, with Darren Redmayne playing the young Gerry. Nigel Marven of the Natural History Unit, Bristol was responsible for the animals side of the production; Denis McKeown, then PhD student in Psychology University of Sussex, did the training of the famous pigeon Quasimodo in the series. The whistling for the theme tune was provided by Ken Barrie, who was the original voice of the children&#x27;s television character Postman Pat.

==== 2005 ====
In 2005, it was adapted by the BBC as a 90-minute film, &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot;, starring Eugene Simon as the young Gerry, Imelda Staunton as Mrs. Durrell and Omid Djalili as Spiro. This adaptation was written by Simon Nye.

==== 2016–2019 ====
On 3 April 2016 ITV began running the six-part series &quot;The Durrells&quot;, also adapted by Simon Nye. Loosely based on the Corfu trilogy, it stars Keeley Hawes as Louisa Durrell and Milo Parker as Gerald Durrell. Three subsequent series of &quot;The Durrells&quot; were broadcast, in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The first series is set in 1935, the second in 1936, the third in 1937, and the fourth in 1938–39.

=== Theatre ===
In 2006, the Jersey Arts Centre&#x27;s Theatre in Education company produced the first stage version, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the book&#x27;s publication in 1956. Adapted and directed by Daniel Austin, the play premiered on 22 February 2007 at Rouge Bouillon School in St Helier.

== Similar titles ==

Several books have alluded to the title of Durrell&#x27;s book, including Josephine Feeney&#x27;s 1995 novel &quot;My Family and Other Natural Disasters&quot;, Simon Doonan&#x27;s 2005 memoir &quot;Nasty: My Family and Other Glamorous Varmints&quot;, Kirin Narayan&#x27;s 2007 memoir &quot;My Family and Other Saints&quot;, and Clare Balding&#x27;s 2014 autobiography, &quot;My Animals and Other Family&quot;.

In &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook&quot; by Terry Pratchett, there is reference to a fictional book titled &quot;My Family and Other Werewolves&quot;.

Martin Clunes hosted a British reality TV show on ITV called &quot;My Travels and Other Animals&quot;.

<text>Jersey Zoo (formerly Durrell Wildlife Park) is a zoological park established in 1959 on the island of Jersey in the English Channel by naturalist and writer Gerald Durrell. It is operated by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. It has approximately 169,000 visitors per year.

Jersey Zoo has always concentrated on rare and endangered species. It has mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, comprising over 130 species.

Since 1964, the zoo has been home to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (formerly the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust).

==Overview==

The park is located at Les Augrès Manor, Trinity, Jersey, north of Saint Helier. It officially opened on 26 March 1959.

The park is situated in of landscaped parkland and water-gardens. The Trust has a commitment to looking after the Island&#x27;s native wildlife, and large areas within the grounds have been designated native habitat areas. The planting of flowering and fruiting trees throughout the grounds also serves to attract wild birds and insects. Included in the former are several species of bird which used to be commonly seen in island gardens but have become increasingly scarce, including the house sparrow and song thrush.

There are over 50 nest-boxes positioned around the grounds, which are used by a variety of birds including barn owls, kestrels, swallows and house martins. Other animals which are commonly seen within the grounds are the red squirrel, bank vole, and the short-toed treecreeper.

==History==
Gerald Durrell began his career capturing animals for other zoos, but thought that the facilities needed to concentrate more on animal conservation rather than mere entertainment. He started the zoo in 1959. Durrell tells the story of starting the zoo in his book &quot;Menagerie Manor&quot; and others.

In January 2008 plans known as &quot;New Vision&quot; were unveiled for the future of the zoo. These plans had an emphasis on the notion of &quot;TopSpots&quot;; places where the greatest diversity of animals are found such as islands and highlands. The plan included projects including African Bai, an environment mirroring the ecology of the African habitat that the western lowland gorillas would need to adapt to if one day it would be safe for them to be left alone in the wild; Mascarenia, to the mammals, birds and terrapins of Madagascar, Mauritius and islands of the western Indian Ocean; and eco-lodge cabins for visitors to stay in.

It was budgeted that the cost of the redevelopment would be in the region of £46 million () over the next five years. All funds needed to be raised through public and private donations. But most of the plan was eventually cancelled due to costs.

In May 2011, a new visitor centre and restaurant was officially opened by Princess Anne. A webcam service has been recently developed at the zoo. Cameras have been installed in the meerkat enclosure, as well as in those of the Telfair&#x27;s skinks, the Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bats and in the Kirindy Forest, the home of a rare and colourful bird collection. The webcam lets viewers to those species at times when they are often inaccessible, including watching the fruit bats during the evening when they are most active. In 2015 an infant silverback gorilla named Indigo who lived at the park was chosen to be the mascot of the 2015 Island Games which were held on the island.

==Exhibits==

===Jewels of the Forest===
Opened in 2004, this exhibit houses various Asian birds such as:

* Palawan peacock-pheasant

===Princess Royal Pavilion===

The Pavilion was opened by Princess Anne in the 1970s, and serves as a conference centre, and classroom. The theatre shows films depicting the work of the trust, and also exhibits artwork. It highlights the work undertaken by the Trust around the world.

===The Gaherty Reptile and Amphibian Centre===

The reptile house is the home of many species of reptiles and amphibians. The Gaherty Reptile and Amphibian Centre was so named because of a gift from Canadian philanthropist Geoff Gaherty. Around sixty percent of the species are not on public display. Those that are include:

;Reptiles

* Ploughshare tortoise
* Madagascan big-headed turtle
* Lesser Antillean iguana

* Radiated tortoise - external paddock (seasonal)
* European adder - outdoor enclosure (seasonal)

;Amphibians

* Mountain chicken
* Strawberry poison-dart frog
* Blue poison dart frog
* Golden poison dart frog
* Mission golden-eyed tree frog
* Amazon poison dart frog

===Discovery Desert===

The Discovery Desert was opened in April 2009, and was designed to give the family of meerkats more room to roam, and prevent them from digging for freedom. Discovery Desert is a mixed-species exhibit featuring other animals which share the meerkat&#x27;s habitat in the wild.

===Gorillas===

The western lowland gorilla family has been represented at Jersey Zoo since it first opened in 1959, when they had only an infant female (thought to be male at first) gorilla named &quot;N&#x27;Pongo&quot;, who was later joined by a younger infant female gorilla named &quot;Nandi&quot;. The current enclosure includes an outdoor play area, and three internal rooms, two large on-show ones and a smaller off-show one. The family of five is led by a silverback called &quot;Badongo&quot;, who was born in La Vallée des Singes, a zoo in France. &quot;Badongo&quot; is the successor of &quot;Ya Kwanza&quot;, and has had two offspring with &quot;Bahasha&quot;, a male named &quot;Indigo&quot; and a female named &quot;Amari&quot;. &quot;Indigo&quot; has since left to start his own family. The remaining members of the troupe are &quot;Kishka&quot; (who died in 2024), and &quot;Hlalli Kahilli&quot; a female descendant of Jambo and &quot;N&#x27;Pongo&quot;.

A expanded and updated gorilla complex is due to be completed in 2024.

;Jambo

Jambo was a gorilla who was born in 1961, in the Zoo Basel, Switzerland. Jambo featured in the news in 31 August 1986, when five-year-old Levan Merritt fell into the gorilla enclosure and lost consciousness. Jambo stood guard over the boy when he was unconscious, placing himself between the boy and other gorillas in what ethnologists analyse as a protective gesture. He later stroked the unconscious boy. When the boy regained consciousness and started to cry, Jambo and the other gorillas retreated, and an ambulance paramedic and two keepers rescued the boy.

===Orangutans and gibbons===

In an enclosure which was revamped in the 1990s the orangutans have a large outdoor play area for them to swing around. The enclosure consists of one large main house, with two extensive external islands surrounded by a moat. The orangutan family have been at Jersey Zoo since 1968, and come from Sumatra. The zoo used to have the Bornean orangutans, until it was decided that it should focus on the rarest when the redevelopment took place. There are currently five orangutans at Jersey Zoo; The dominant male is called Dagu. The adult females are, Annette and Dana. The two offspring are Mawar (who moved to Prague Zoo with her son Gempa in 2011)&#x27;s eldest son Jiwa and Annette&#x27;s son Jantho. Sharing the island play areas is a female lar gibbon named Hazel and a white cheeked gibbon named Genta. 

===Tamarins and marmosets===
The tamarins are kept in two areas of the park, some such as the golden lion and emperor tamarins best kept within their own enclosures. Meanwhile, others such as the pied tamarin and the silvery marmoset are allowed to run free in a small wooded area.

===Central Valley===

The Central Valley, expands across the centre of the park, creating a natural barrier and water resource for local species. £1 million project to redevelop the central valley, completed in 2002, has created an area for kingfishers, bank voles, butterflies, dragonflies, and several species of waterfowl. During the valley restoration two species of locally rare orchid were encouraged, and first flowered in 2005. They are &quot;Anacamptis laxiflora&quot; and Dactylorhiza praetermissa.

Since 1964 Jersey Zoo have been working with the macaque family, in the same location, just to the side of the valley. The family have bred well, though counterbalance the work by the zoo&#x27;s team.

In 2022 the zoo introduced a troupe of 15 gelada to the park. They moved in next door to the Macaque family.

===Aviaries===

Dotted around the Central Valley are a number of aviaries which house a selection of birds from different parts of the world. The aviaries are specialised to reflect habitat the birds should become adapted to should they be released back into the wild. They are large enough for them to fly short distances, or search the ground for food.

* Northern bald ibis
* Edward&#x27;s pheasant
* Bali starling
* Pink pigeon
* Malagasy Black bulbul
* Montserrat oriole
* Wrinkled hornbill
* White-crowned robin-chat
* Javan green magpie
* Sumatran laughingthrush
* Black-winged stilt
* White-winged duck
* White-backed duck
* African pygmy goose
* Madagascar turtle dove

===Lemur Lake and Pontoon===

* Ring-tailed lemur
* Red ruffed lemur
* Alaotran gentle lemur

===Island Bat Roost===

A large polytunnel was built with used tyres in spring 2011. It is the new home of two species of bat. An additional tunnel was completed in summer 2017. It was also built using recycled materials and will provide more room for the bats to fly, in particular creating a circular flying pattern.

* Rodrigues flying fox
* Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bat

===Butterfly Kaleidoscope===
In 2019, a butterfly walkthrough tunnel was built and opened by Princess Anne. It contains Menelaus blue morpho butterflies and some giant tortoises.

===Tortoise Tunnel===
Opened in 2023, this is a new temperature-controlled home for four Aldabra giant tortoises.

===Kirindy Forest===
A major renovation project was to transform the Walled Gardens into an area marked Kirindy Forest. Based on the dry forests of Madagascar, the area is designed to showcase the work being done with the native species. There are homes for lemurs, giant jumping rats, mongooses and a walkthrough aviary.

* Black-and-white ruffed lemur
* Red-fronted brown lemur
* Aye-aye
* Narrow-striped mongoose
* Malagasy giant rat

;Kirindy Walkthrough Aviary
* Hammerkop
* Meller&#x27;s duck
* Madagascar crested ibis
* Red fody
* Namaqua dove

===Conservation successes===
In 1976 there were only four Mauritius kestrel individuals in the wild with one female. Durrell took the risk of taking a recent clutch of eggs and had them hatched successfully – rebuilding the species, almost from scratch. The conservation for the species has moved on to the next stage and its focus has returned to Mauritius, re-establishing the species in the community and ecosystem.

Originally extinct from the wild, the zoo was part of the coalition of zoos which together brought the Przewalski&#x27;s horse species from the brink of extinction.

==Work in Jersey==

Jersey Zoo works with local wildlife groups to help with the declining populations of Jersey&#x27;s sand lizard, the Jersey crapaud / common toad, and Jersey&#x27;s agile frog. It also undertakes efforts to maintain the genetic diversity of locally rare plants. Currently four species are being grown in the propagation unit. &quot;Fragaria vesca&quot; (wild strawberry), &quot;Dianthus gallicus&quot; (Jersey pink), &quot;Anogramma leptophylla&quot; (Jersey fern) and &quot;Linaria vulgaris&quot; (common toadflax).Other plant species will be propagated as seed or cutting material becomes available. As some of these plant species are severely threatened, finding specimens for propagation will be a challenge.

In 2010, Jersey Zoo undertook a project to reintroduce birds that once populated the island&#x27;s clifftops, but have long disappeared. The red-billed chough is the first focus of the programme. There are also plans to do something similar with the yellowhammer should the project prove successful. The red-billed chough became extinct on Jersey in the nineteenth century, but they have once again returned. Jersey Zoo has joined a breeding programme and so a group are being kept there to form a captive colony, with hope to establish a free flying colony on Jersey&#x27;s north coast.
==Operations overseas==
Although no longer located in Jersey, conservation of Pygmy hogs is still monitored by Jersey Zoo in Assam, India and other locations. During 2008 some pygmy hogs were released into the wild in Assam, early reports show good progress with the species.

There has been some success in Grand Cayman with the blue iguana. Working alongside local authorities the iguana is being saved from extinction. It shows what can be done. In 2008 the project suffered a drawback when intruders broke into the complex and killed numerous iguanas, including juveniles and expecting females.

The Madagascar pochard was previously thought extinct, though was rediscovered when looking for something else. Jersey Zoo have recently teamed up with Madagascar to help research and study the species. With scouts unable to locate more individuals, it has become a possibility that experts will have to bring the survivors back to Jersey, using expertise from the Madagascar teal and Meller&#x27;s duck to help the duck get back from the brink.

In 1995 the Antiguan racer was dubbed the world&#x27;s rarest snake. More recently the species have been relocated back to Antigua on some islands where they are free from predators and pests.

==Durrell Wildlife Camp==
Work began on the Durrell Wildlife Camp in early 2012, which will allow the park to sell lodging and services to visitors.

A wooded copse to the west of Les Augrès Manor has been landscaped to provide a nine-metre-square level wooden deck roughly every seven metres. These decks will house twelve geodesic dome-shaped, semi permanent tent structures and a separate shower and toilet cubicle for each. A further two platforms will house a communal structure and a pod for health and beauty treatments.

<doc id="241965" wikidata="Q564407" url="?curid=241965" title="Annals of Improbable Research">
<text>The Annals of Improbable Research (AIR) is a bimonthly magazine devoted to scientific humor, in the form of a satirical take on the standard academic journal. &quot;AIR&quot;, published six times a year since 1995, usually showcases at least one piece of scientific research being done on a strange or unexpected topic, but most of their articles concern real or fictional absurd experiments, such as a comparison of apples and oranges using infrared spectroscopy. Other features include such things as ratings of the cafeterias at scientific institutes, fake classifieds and advertisements for a medical plan called HMO-NO, and a very odd letters page. The magazine is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

&quot;AIR&quot; awards the annual science Ig Nobel Prizes, for ten achievements that &quot;first make people laugh, and then make them think&quot;. &quot;AIR&quot; also runs the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists.

== History ==
&quot;AIR&quot; is not the first science parody magazine. The &quot;Journal of Irreproducible Results&quot; (&quot;JIR&quot;) was founded by Alex Kohn and Harry J. Lipkin in 1955, but its editorial staff, including editor Marc Abrahams, left after the magazine was bought by publisher George Scherr in 1994. Scherr filed a number of court actions against &quot;AIR&quot;, alleging that it was deceptively similar to the &quot;Journal&quot; and that it had stolen the name &quot;Ig Nobel Prize&quot;, but these actions were unsuccessful.

== Profile ==
Occasional &quot;AIR&quot; articles are factual and illuminating, if a bit offbeat. For example, in 2003 researcher-documentary producer Nick T. Spark wrote about the background and history of Murphy&#x27;s Law in a four-part article, &quot;Why Everything You know About Murphy&#x27;s Law is Wrong&quot;. It was revised, expanded and later published in June 2006 as the book &quot;A History of Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;. Another example: it was scientifically proved and waggishly reported that instruments can &quot;distinguish shit from Shinola.&quot;

<text>A caesura (, . caesuras or caesurae; Latin for &quot;cutting&quot;), also written cæsura and cesura, is a metrical pause or break in a verse where one phrase ends and another phrase begins. It may be expressed by a comma (,), a tick (✓), or two lines, either slashed (//) or upright (||). In time value, this break may vary between the slightest perception of silence all the way up to a full pause.

==Poetry==

In classical Greek and Latin poetry a caesura is the juncture where one word ends and the following word begins within a foot. In contrast, a word juncture at the end of a foot is called a diaeresis. Some caesurae are expected and represent a point of articulation between two phrases or clauses. All other caesurae are only potentially places of articulation. The opposite of an obligatory caesura is a bridge where word juncture is not permitted.

In modern European poetry, a caesura is defined as a natural phrase end, especially when occurring in the middle of a line. A follows a stressed syllable while a follows an unstressed syllable. A caesura is also described by its position in a line of poetry: a caesura close to the beginning of a line is called an &quot;initial&quot; caesura, one in the middle of a line is &quot;medial&quot;, and one near the end of a line is &quot;terminal.&quot; Initial and terminal caesurae are rare in formal, Romance, and Neoclassical verse, which prefer medial caesurae.

===Mark===

In verse scansion, the modern caesura mark is a double vertical bar ⟨||⟩ or ⟨formula_1⟩, a variant of the single-bar &quot;&quot; (&quot;twig&quot;) used as a caesura mark in medieval manuscripts. The same mark separately developed as the virgule, the single slash used to mark line breaks in poetry.

===Examples===

====Homer====
Caesurae were widely used in Greek poetry. For example, in the opening line of the &quot;Iliad&quot;:
: || 

:(&quot;Sing the rage, o goddess, || of Achilles, the son of Peleus.&quot;)

This line includes a masculine caesura after θεὰ, a natural break that separates the line into two logical parts. Homeric lines more commonly employ feminine caesurae; this preference is observed to an even higher degree among the Alexandrian poets. An example of a feminine caesura is the opening line of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;:
: || 

:(&quot;Tell me, Muse, of the man || of many wiles, who very much (wandered)&quot;)

Occasionally (about 1 line in 100) the caesura comes in the 4th foot only.

====Latin====
Caesurae were widely used in Latin poetry, for example, in the opening line of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;:

:Arma virumque cano || Troiae qui primus ab oris

:(Of arms and the man, I sing. || Who first from the shores of Troy...)

This line uses caesura in the medial position. In dactylic hexameter, a caesura occurs any time the ending of a word does not coincide with the beginning or the end of a metrical foot; in modern prosody, however, it is only called one when the ending also coincides with an audible pause in the line.

The ancient elegiac couplet form of the Greeks and Romans contained a line of dactylic hexameter followed by a line of pentameter. The pentameter often displayed a clearer caesura, as in this example from Propertius:

:Cynthia prima fuit; || Cynthia finis erit.

:(Cynthia was the first; Cynthia will be the last)

====Old English====
In Old English, the caesura has come to represent a pronounced pause in order to emphasize lines in Old English poetry that would otherwise be considered to be a droning, monotonous line. This makes the caesura arguably more important to the Old English verse than it was to Latin or Greek poetry. In Latin or Greek poetry, the caesura could be suppressed for effect in any line. In the alliterative verse that is shared by most of the oldest Germanic languages, the caesura is an ever-present and necessary part of the verse form itself. The opening line of &quot;Beowulf&quot; reads:

:Hwæt! We Gardena || in gear-dagum,
:þeodcyninga, || þrym gefrunon,
:hu ða æþelingas || ellen fremedon.

:(Behold! The Spear-Danes in days gone by,)
:(and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness,)
:(We have heard of these princes&#x27; heroic campaigns.)

The basic form is accentual verse, with four stresses per line separated by a caesura. Old English poetry added alliteration and other devices to this basic pattern.

====Middle English====
William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Ploughman&quot;:

:I loked on my left half || as þe lady me taughte
:And was war of a woman || worþeli ycloþed.

:(I looked on my left half / as the lady me taught)
:(and was aware of a woman / worthily clothed.)

==== South and Southeast Asia ====
In the Brahmic scripts of South and Southeast Asia (e.g. Devanagari), a punctuation mark called the danda is used to mark subdivisions in text, with single and double variants variously marking phrases, sentences, semi-verses, verses, or larger sections.

An example of the use of danda as caesurae in Indian poetry is in the &quot;dohas&quot; or couplet poems of Sant Kabir Das, a 15th-century poet who was central to the Bhakti movement in Hinduism. Kabir employs the danda to mark semi-verse and verse, as in the following couplet:
: कस्तूरी कुंडल बसे मृग ढूँढत बन माहि । 
: ज्यों घट घट में राम हैं दुनिया देखत नाहि ।।
: Kastūrī kuṃḍala base, mṛga ḍhūm̐ḍhata bana māhi ।
: Jyo ghaṭa ghaṭa rāma hai, duniyā dekhe nāhī ।।
: (Musk lies in the musk deer’s own nave ।)
: (But roam in the forest he does – it to seek ।।)

====Polish====
Caesura is very important in Polish syllabic verse (as in French alexandrine). Every line longer than eight syllables is divided into two half-lines. Lines composed of the same number of syllables with division in different place are considered to be completely different metrical patterns. For example, Polish alexandrine (13) is almost always divided 7+6. It has been very common in Polish poetry for last five centuries. But the metre 13(8+5) occurs only rarely and 13(6+7) can be hardly found. In Polish accentual-syllabic verse caesura is not so important but iambic tetrametre (very popular today) is usually 9(5+4). Caesura in Polish syllabic verse is almost always feminine, while in accentual-syllabic (especially iambic) verse it is often masculine: sSsSsSsS//sSsSsSsSs. There are also metrical patterns with two or three caesuras, for example 18[9(5+4)+9(5+4)].

====Other examples====
Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called ballad meter, or the common meter of the hymnodists (see also hymn), is usually thought of as a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of trimeter, but it can also be considered a line of heptameter with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot.

Considering the break as a caesura in these verse forms, rather than a beginning of a new line, explains how sometimes multiple caesurae can be found in this verse form (from the ballad, Tom o&#x27; Bedlam):

:From the hag and hungry goblin || that into rags would rend ye,
:And the spirits that stand || by the naked man || in the Book of Moons, defend ye!

In later and freer verse forms, the caesura is optional. It can, however, be used for rhetorical effect, as in Alexander Pope&#x27;s line:

:To err is human; || to forgive, divine.

== Music ==
In music, a caesura denotes a brief, silent pause, during which metrical time is not counted. Similar to a silent fermata, caesurae are located between notes or measures (before or over bar lines), rather than on notes or rests (as with a fermata). A fermata may be placed over a caesura to indicate a longer pause.

In musical notation, a caesura is marked by double oblique lines, similar to a pair of slashes . The symbol is popularly called &quot;tram-lines&quot; in the UK and &quot;railroad tracks&quot; or &quot;train tracks&quot; in the US. The symbol is encoded in Unicode as .

The length of a caesura where notated is at the discretion of the musician.

<doc id="241970" wikidata="Q2414772" url="?curid=241970" title="ReBoot">
<text>ReBoot is a Canadian animated television series created by Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell, and John Grace, with the visuals designed by Brendan McCarthy after an initial attempt by Ian Gibson. It was produced by Vancouver-based Mainframe Entertainment, Alliance Distribution and BLT Productions; and originally aired on YTV from 1994 until 2001. It is notable for being one of the first made-for-television CGI series.

==Overview==

The show follows the adventures of a Guardian named Bob and his companions Enzo and Dot Matrix within the computer system world of Mainframe as they work to keep it safe from the viruses known as Megabyte and Hexadecimal, in addition to other threats. Recurring plot threads include the User loading a game into the system, manifesting as an electrical violet cube lowered onto part of the city. Anyone trapped inside become NPCs and have the chance to play against the User. If the User wins, the area is destroyed (a.k.a. nullified) and the residents are reduced to leech-like creatures called Nulls. The setting of the inner world of a computer system, known by its inhabitants as Mainframe, was deliberately chosen due to technological constraints at the time, as the fictional computer world allowed for blocky-looking models and mechanical animation.

== Cast and characters ==

The main characters included:
*Bob – Guardian  452. He acts as the Guardian of Mainframe.
* Phong – The original of Mainframe. Phong serves as a mentor and adviser to its inhabitants and works with Bob in defense of the system.
*Dot Matrix – Initially owns a local diner and many other &quot;businesses&quot; (as seen at the end of the third episode of the first season). She takes over as in the third season.
*Enzo Matrix – Dot&#x27;s younger brother who idolized Bob as a hero. Enzo later grows up to become the renegade simply known as Matrix. Enzo&#x27;s name is not a reference to computer terminology but instead the real-world Italian name &quot;Enzo&quot;, as suggested to the co-creators by Chris Brough.
*Frisket – A red and yellow dog. He is feral, incredibly strong, and only listens to Enzo.
*AndrAIa – A game sprite and friend (and later girlfriend) of Enzo introduced in season 2. She came from a &#x27;Treasure of Atlantis&#x27; game and as such wears many seashells on her outfit. The &quot;AI&quot; in her name refers to artificial intelligence.
*Megabyte (Gigabyte) – A &quot;command and conquer, and infectious&quot; computer virus, and the show&#x27;s main antagonist. Megabyte is an &quot;Order Virus&quot;. He came from the virus known as Kilobyte and when merged with his sister Hexadecimal, they form an even more powerful virus called Gigabyte. Megabyte commands his own army of binomes, and is quite strong, and capable of separating his top half from his lower half whenever he needs to. 
*Hexadecimal – Megabyte&#x27;s sister is a &quot;chaotic&quot; computer virus whose face is represented by a series of masks, each portraying a different emotion. She possesses incredible energy manipulating powers and telekinetic abilities. She is also shown to be able to fly on her own and controls the Nulls of Mainframe.
*Mouse – A freelance hacker who is mentioned briefly before her first appearance. Mouse works for Megabyte in a one-shot early in the season, but switches sides to join Dot and Enzo. Together they defend Mainframe when Bob is trapped in &quot;The Web&quot;.
*Hack &amp; Slash – Comic-relief bumblers, they are two most commonly seen henchmen in Megabyte&#x27;s employ. During the third season, they switch sides and join the side of Mainframe.
*Ray Tracer – A web surfer that helps Matrix and Bob return to Mainframe, and becomes romantically linked to Mouse.
*Mike the TV – A walking television that aids and hinders the heroes. Mike the TV is shown speaking in a commercial narration-like voice.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;ReBoot&quot; was initially conceived in 1984 by the British creative collective The Hub, made up of John Grace, Ian Pearson, Gavin Blair and Phil Mitchell. After about eight years of development, Pearson, Blair and Mitchell moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to produce the series. Pearson and Blair by this time had created some of the first widely seen CGI characters, in the Dire Straits music video for &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;. However, technology was not yet advanced enough to make the show in the desired way. 3D animation tests began in earnest in 1990 and &quot;ReBoot&quot; had achieved its detailed look by 1991. Production continued on future episodes and the show aired in 1994 after enough episodes had been produced. This was a painstaking process, as no other company had at this time worked on a 3D animation project of this scale, and the software used was new to all in the company.

&quot;ReBoot&quot; was created on Silicon Graphics workstations using Softimage Creative Environment software.

=== Network censorship ===
The show&#x27;s early jokes at the expense of Board of Standards and Practices (BS&amp;P) came from frustration encountered by the show&#x27;s makers brought about by an abundance of script and editing changes that were imposed upon Mainframe before episodes were allowed to air. These changes were all aimed at making the show &quot;appropriate&quot; for kids, and to prevent even the slightest appearance of &quot;inappropriate&quot; content, imitable violence or sexuality.

The character Dot was considered too sexualized by the BS&amp;P even though she was &quot;never one to expose much cleavage&quot; so the animators were forced to make her breasts less curvy and form them into a lumpy &quot;monobreast&quot;, as lightly referred to by the staff. However, starting with season three, after severing ties with ABC, the &quot;monobreasts&quot; of all adult female characters were replaced with more anatomically correct versions. In another case, the word &quot;hockey&quot;, as well as the sport itself, was cut in some countries as it was supposedly used as a vulgar slang term there. In the episode &quot;Talent Night&quot;, one scene of Dot giving her brother Enzo &quot;a sisterly kiss on the chin&quot; was cut due to BS&amp;P&#x27;s fear of promoting incest, an insinuation which Pearson described as &quot;one of the sickest things I&#x27;ve heard.&quot;

== Episodes ==
=== Season 1 ===
Each installment of the first season was a self-contained episode except for the two-part finale. When the User loads a game, a game cube drops on a random location in Mainframe, sealing it off from the rest of the system and turning it into a gamescape. Bob frequently enters the games, reboots to become a game character, and fights the User&#x27;s character to save the sector. If the User wins a game, the sector the cube fell in is destroyed, and the sprites and binomes who were caught within are turned into energy-draining, worm-like parasites called nulls. When this happens, they are said to be &quot;nullified&quot;.

In the U.S., the show was aired on the ABC Network and had to comply with Broadcast Standards and Practices. This was lampooned in &quot;Talent Night&quot;, where almost every act for Enzo&#x27;s party is banned by Prog Censor Emma See and the Small Town Binomes sing their hit &quot;BSnP&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s fun to play/In a non-violent way&quot;).

=== Season 2 ===
The second season was initially as episodic as the first but later featured an extended story arc that began with the season&#x27;s fifth episode, &quot;Painted Windows&quot;. The arc revealed that Hexadecimal and Megabyte are siblings, and introduced an external threat to Mainframe: the Web, which was set up in fearful mentions in &quot;High Code&quot; and &quot;Painted Windows&quot;. The sixth episode, &quot;AndrAIa&quot;, also saw a new character in the titular AndrAIa join the cast. Creator Gavin Blair has said the move to a longer arc came from &quot;shrugging off the shackles of ABC and their BS&amp;P&quot; after being cancelled. The last episode would reveal Megabyte&#x27;s ships were called ABCs.
A creature from the Web entered Mainframe from Hexadecimal&#x27;s looking glass (which was shattered by Mike the TV), bonding with her. Mainframe&#x27;s nulls reacted spontaneously and covered her to form a monster named Nullzilla, which was defeated and neutralized by the protectors of Mainframe. The Web creature located Megabyte, took him over and forced him to merge with Hexadecimal, forming a next-gen super-virus called Gigabyte. Gigabyte was eventually neutralized as well, but the Web creature escaped into the bowels of Mainframe, where it began stealing energy to stay alive and grow. Mouse, a mercenary and old friend of Bob&#x27;s, helped to find the Web Creature, but was almost destroyed by a bomb set by her employer, Turbo. The explosion created a &quot;tear&quot; (an unstable energy-based anomaly) which the Web creature used to create a portal to the Web. The protectors of Mainframe had to team up with Megabyte and Hexadecimal to close the portal. An army of CPU police clashed with an invasion of creatures from the Web. In the midst of the chaos, Megabyte betrayed the alliance (with the CPUs calling the ABCs &quot;treacherous dogs!&quot;), crushing Bob&#x27;s keytool, Glitch, and sending him into the Web portal before closing it.

=== Season 3 ===
Initially, Mainframe thought they would follow up the second season with a film. The treatment was called &quot;Terabyte Rising&quot; and was to include flashbacks to the destruction of Mainframe&#x27;s Twin City. This was dropped but much of it would be used for the fourth season.

The show&#x27;s third season exhibited a marked improvement in modeling and animation quality due to the advancement of Mainframe Entertainment&#x27;s software capabilities during the time between seasons. Subtle details, such as eyelashes and shadows, as well as generally more lifelike polygonal characters, were among several visual improvements. The show&#x27;s target audience shifted to children aged 12 and older, resulting in a darker and more mature storyline. After severing ties with ABC following the second season, the show reached a greater number of households through syndication.

Enzo, freshly upgraded into a Guardian candidate by Bob during the Web incursion, defends Mainframe from Megabyte and Hexadecimal, with Dot and AndrAIa at his side. When Enzo entered a game he could not win, he, AndrAIa, and Frisket changed their icons to game sprite mode and rode the game out of Mainframe. The accelerated game time resulted in Enzo and AndrAIa&#x27;s aging. Subsequent episodes follow adult versions of Enzo and AndrAIa, who are now in a romantic relationship, as they travel from system to system in search of Mainframe. The older Enzo adopts the name &quot;Matrix&quot; (his and Dot&#x27;s surname), carrying a weapon named &quot;Gun&quot; and Bob&#x27;s damaged Glitch. The time spent in games and away from Mainframe hardened both Matrix and AndrAIa: Matrix developed a pathological hatred of viruses, and grew into a muscular, shoot-first-ask-questions-later antihero, while AndrAIa turned into a level-headed warrior. As the season progresses, Matrix and AndrAIa are reunited with Bob and the crew of the &quot;Saucy Mare&quot; and return to Mainframe, which has been almost completely destroyed by Megabyte and his forces. The group reunites with Dot and the resistance, then heads to the Principal Office for a final battle with Megabyte. Megabyte is defeated by Matrix, but not before Megabyte&#x27;s handiwork causes the system to crash. All final problems in Mainframe were dealt with by The User restarting the system, setting everything right and restoring everything as it was again for the protagonists, with one major exception: younger and older Enzo now exist simultaneously, as Matrix&#x27;s icon was still set to &quot;Game Sprite&quot; mode and was not recognized properly by the system when it rebooted, so that the system restored a copy of his younger self. The season concludes in a musical production put on by the binomes recapping the past two seasons plot events.

=== Season 4 ===
After the end of the third season, two TV movies were produced in 2001: &quot;&quot;, which addressed the problem the Guardians were facing in season three (and used much of &quot;Terabyte Rising&quot;), and &quot;&quot;, which brings back a corroded and mutated Megabyte in a cliffhanger ending. The two movies, broken up into eight episodes in its U.S. run on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami, revealed much of Mainframe&#x27;s history, including the formation of Lost Angles, Bob&#x27;s arrival in the system, and the origin of Megabyte and Hexadecimal. The films end with Megabyte in control of the Principal Office, and the characters scattered and about to be hunted down. It is revealed that the nulls still possess their old sentience and intelligence: The heroes manage to put the null that was once Dot&#x27;s father into a robot, enabling him to move and speak like he used to.

Initial plans for the fourth season included three films broken into 12 episodes, followed by a 13th musical-special episode. Due to a change in deals and budget, the series was reduced to eight episodes. The following plan was to produce 30-minute episodes. These would be edited down to 21 minutes for broadcast and the extra scenes added to the film versions for DVD release. Against the writer&#x27;s wishes, these scenes were cut from the scripts. After this decision was made, the eighth episode was rewritten to end on a cliffhanger.

Creator Gavin Blair has publicly refused to reveal the plans for the resolution and final episodes, in case he ever got the chance to resolve the cliffhanger.

== In other media ==
=== Video game ===

In 1998, a video game was released based on the TV series, developed and published by EA for the PlayStation video game console. It was rated E for Everyone. It received a positive rating of 69.50% based on six reviews at the aggregator GameRankings.com.

=== Webcomic ===
Following its acquisition by the Rainmaker Income Fund in 2006, Mainframe Entertainment was renamed Rainmaker Animation. In 2007, Rainmaker announced plans to create a trilogy of &quot;ReBoot&quot; films with illustrator/animator Daniel Allen as the lead character designer. In conjunction with the website Zeroes2Heroes, Rainmaker announced an intention to allow fans greater access to the development of the film version&#x27;s plans and also to the development of a &quot;ReBoot&quot; webcomic. Fans were given the chance to submit their own art and designs, with the potential to become an artist on the project, and their feedback helped decide which of five &quot;ReBoot&quot; pitches was developed.

The winning pitch was &quot;ReBoot: Arrival&quot;. Rainmaker said it would monitor feedback for the webcomic but may not use it as the basis for the company&#x27;s movie plans. Four fans were chosen to work as artists on the &quot;Arrival&quot; comic. According to the pitch at the Zeroes2Heroes website, Megabyte&#x27;s Hunt has developed into a Net-wide war so pervasive that even other viruses united against it. The Users have gone, spending their time in an unending massively multiplayer online game. A sentient system named Gnosis is created as a way to stop Megabyte but goes rogue and begins enslaving other systems in its attempt to gain User-like powers. To stop Gnosis and bring back the Users, two teams of heroes are assembled which will include new characters and Lens the Codemaster, who appeared in the season 2 episode &quot;High Code&quot;. Elements of this would be dropped in the comic.

The official &quot;ReBoot&quot; website was updated with a countdown, which ended on May 30, 2008, at 12:00 a.m. EST. Shortly afterwards, the site was updated with information about the first webcomic from the &quot;Arrival&quot; team and ongoing community input. The comic, renamed &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, was viewable after creating an account or using an existing Zeros 2 Heroes account.

A new countdown appeared on the official &quot;ReBoot&quot; website on August 18, 2008 to launch the second installment of the webcomic. Updates to the comic were posted on Mondays, with two pages each update. The comic ended shortly after Christmas, and surveys were added to the site. &quot;The Art of ReBoot&quot;, a 104-page hardcover artbook, was published in February 2007 by Beach Studios; it contained copies of various rare and never-before-seen conceptual artwork, with the work of Brendan McCarthy being a major focus.

On July 24, 2009, the &quot;ReBoot&quot; website was upgraded into the official &quot;ReBoot&quot; fansite, with the webcomic freely available. The website was set to shut down for July 30, 2012 after several years of inactivity; an announcement on July 27, 2012, revealed that the site would remain open.

==== Synopsis ====
The first &quot;Paradigms Lost&quot; issue opens with the aftermath of the Hunt: Mainframe is devastated and overrun with Zombinomes, the User is missing, and the entire population is being evacuated to the Super Computer. Worse still, the weakened Guardian Collective is facing viral attacks and uprisings across the entire Net. Turbo blames Bob for this, saying that his views on viruses became widespread and left them weakened. Enzo Matrix, meanwhile, is a star pupil in the Guardian Academy. The viral threat is ended when the Codemasters pledge their help, offering a firmware named Gnosis. Gnosis is uploaded to every System on the Net, erasing all viruses and ending the crisis. The first issue ends with the Codemasters&#x27; Guildmaster activating a &quot;Phase Two&quot; for the implemented Gnosis.

The second and third issues had the heroes, now joined by Lens, try to stop the Codemasters from using Gnosis to access the Code itself, allowing the Guildmaster total control. However, Gnosis swiftly decides that it can complete its task better with the Guildmaster deleted, and following that it eliminates the Guardians. Mainframe and 36 other systems are enslaved as power sources for its mission. Dot tries to carry out rebel action in Mainframe, Bob and Lens retreat to the bowels of the Super-Computer to hide, and Enzo is captured and discovers Megabyte (his code retained by Gnosis) is a key Gnosis advisor.

Bob is recruited by Exidy, an entity that is the source of the Code and trapped by Gnosis in the Net; intent on restoring balance and stability, she gives Bob the ability to wield the Code. While the main heroes link up and Bob is sent to take on Gnosis directly, Enzo verbally battles with Megabyte for influence over Gnosis, pointing out that it could accomplish its task quicker if it was cooperative and asked for assistance. When Gnosis comes around to this, Bob decides to allow the weapon to live and reprograms it, and has it restore the Net to the way it was. That done, he frees Exidy and returns home.

=== Unmade spin-offs ===
==== Television ====
A spinoff called &quot;Binomes&quot; was planned towards the end of year 2004, featuring a family of Binomes who lived on a &quot;chip farm&quot;. The series would have consisted of 52 11-minute episodes, aimed at a pre-school audience, but nothing of this project came to pass after the initial announcement.

==== Film trilogy ====
In June 2008, Rainmaker Animation announced plans for a trilogy of theatrical &quot;ReBoot&quot; films, with the first to be written by Jon Cooksey. A teaser for the film was released on October 5, 2009, on Rainmaker&#x27;s official site, and in March 2011, Rainmaker said a &quot;ReBoot&quot; film remained in the company&#x27;s plans. In a podcast released April 8, 2013, Rainmaker president and executive producer Michael Hefferon said the film trilogy was no longer being worked on.

=== &quot;ReBoot: The Guardian Code&quot; ===

A reimagined, live-action/CGI-animated series, &quot;&quot;, was announced in 2015, and the first ten episodes premiered on Netflix worldwide (excluding Canada) on March 30, 2018. YTV aired all 20 episodes from June 4 until July 5, 2018.
The series follows four teenaged gamers, who are members of an online game&#x27;s highest-scoring team. Vera is an artificial intelligence who has recruited the team as &quot;Guardians&quot; to physically enter and protect cyberspace. The Guardians battle the Sourcerer, a human hacker. Primary characters from the original series, such as Bob, Dot, and Enzo, are minor characters and only appear in one episode.

=== Documentary ===
An eight part documentary about the show, entitled &quot;ReBoot ReWind&quot;, was launched on September 24, 2024 on Telus Storyhive. The documentarians also collaborated with Mainframe to remaster the series from its original D-1 tapes, with a remastered version of the first episode released on YouTube on September 10, 2024 to mark its thirtieth anniversary.

== Telecast and digital releases ==
=== Television airings ===
&quot;ReBoot&quot; was first aired on Saturday mornings in Canada on YTV and in the U.S. in 1994 by ABC. It was canceled by ABC after The Walt Disney Company purchased the network in 1996. Episodes continued to air in Canada. Some episodes from the first and second seasons could still be seen in the U.S. when Claster Television distributed them during the 1996–97 season as part of &quot;The Power Block&quot;, with different shows airing in one timeslot on different days; &quot;ReBoot&quot; aired on Thursdays. It would be a year until new episodes aired on YTV due to Mainframe&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Beast Wars: Transformers&quot; (known as &quot;Beasties&quot; in Canada) and &quot;Shadow Raiders&quot;, and the third season aired only on YTV at the time. In April 1999, sixteen months after the third season finale on YTV, it debuted in the US market on Cartoon Network (who would also premiere the fourth and final season in 2000), airing in repeats until 2001.

Production on other shows delayed the fourth season of &quot;ReBoot&quot;, the eight episodes of which eventually were aired in the U.S., but were also put together as two 90-minute direct-to-DVD features that ended on a cliffhanger season finale. The show&#x27;s creators Blair and Pearson resigned from Mainframe Entertainment in 2004 to form their own independent studio, The Shop.

The show also aired in the United Kingdom from January 4, 1995 until April 9, 1998, on the ITV network as part of their CITV programming block. When it came to the third season, Meridian only purchased the broadcasting rights for the first 10 episodes of the season and on July 17, 1997, CITV started airing season 3 before anywhere else in the world; however, this run came to a halt in August after the sixth episode, &quot;Where No Sprite Has Gone Before&quot;. On February 12, 1998, CITV reaired the show from the season 2 episode &quot;Trust No One&quot; until going into the episodes that had yet to be aired at that point. When &quot;To Mend and Defend&quot; should have aired, the episode &quot;Firewall&quot; was substituted since &quot;To Mend And Defend&quot; received 19 complaints from viewers who claimed &quot;the violence was unacceptable and the characters were inappropriate in a children&#x27;s programme shown at this time&quot; on its original airing in July 1997. It was not specified, however, why the following episode, &quot;Between a Raccoon and a Hard Place&quot;, was omitted from the run. The run was abruptly stopped without warning after the episode &quot;Return of the Crimson Binome&quot;, and the remainder of the series wasn&#x27;t aired due to ITV deeming the content unsuitable. After the abrupt end of the run, several British fans contacted ITV in order to persuade them to air the remaining episodes, and ITV replied saying that the show&#x27;s low ratings made them wary of acquiring the broadcast rights to the remaining episodes.

The first season was shown in Ireland on RTÉ2 in 1995. In Germany, it premiered on KiKa in 1997.

=== Home media ===
In Canada, four VHS tapes were released in 1995 with individual episodes from the first season through Polygram Video. Each release contained a single episode: &quot;Medusa Bug&quot;, &quot;Wizards, Warriors, and a Word from Our Sponsor&quot;, &quot;The Great Brain Robbery&quot;, and &quot;Talent Night&quot;. In the United Kingdom, receiving two VHS releases, but with two episodes each: Volume 1 contained &quot;The Tearing&quot; and &quot;Racing the Clock&quot;, while Volume 2 had &quot;The Quick and the Fed&quot; and &quot;Medusa Bug&quot;.

The second season was never released, even though Polygram retained the rights to publish the episodes on home video via their deal for the first season. Despite this, in 2000, Mainframe struck a deal with the US A.D. Vision to release the third season on DVD.

Shout! Factory acquired the rights to the show in October 2010 and released seasons 1 and 2 as a standalone title on March 1, 2011. On the same date, the complete series went on sale as a box set (titled &quot;ReBoot: The Definitive Mainframe Collection&quot;) exclusively through Shout&#x27;s official online store months before the set was scheduled to be on retail shelves. Seasons 3 and 4 were released on June 28, 2011, as well as a general retail release of the complete series set.

As of 2023, the show is available to watch on streaming service Pluto TV.

== Awards ==
&quot;ReBoot&quot; has been the recipient of several awards. The show received Gemini Awards for Best Animated Program Series for three straight years between 1995 and 1997, as well as a 1996 Outstanding Technical Achievement Award. Other honors include the 1995 Award of Excellence and Best Animated Program from the Alliance for Children and Television and a Prix Aurora Award in 1996.

Other Gemini Award nominations include &quot;Best Children&#x27;s or Youth Program or Series&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Best Sound – Comedy, Variety, or Performing Arts Program or Series&quot; for &quot;My Two Bobs&quot; and &quot;Best Sound – Dramatic Program&quot; for &quot;Daemon Rising&quot;, both in 2002.

<text>Christian G. Wolff (born March 8, 1934) is an American composer of experimental classical music and classicist.

==Biography==
Wolff was born in Nice, France, to the German literary publishers Helen and Kurt Wolff, who had published works by Franz Kafka, Robert Musil, and Walter Benjamin. After relocating to the U.S. in 1941, they helped to found Pantheon Books with other European intellectuals who had fled Europe during the rise of fascism. The Wolffs published a series of notable English translations of European literature, mostly, as well as an edition of the &quot;I Ching&quot; that came to greatly impress John Cage after Wolff had given him a copy.

Wolff became an American citizen in 1946. When he was sixteen (in 1950) his piano teacher Grete Sultan sent him for lessons in composition to the new music composer John Cage. Wolff soon became a close associate of Cage and his artistic circle which was part of the New York School and included the fellow composers Earle Brown and Morton Feldman, the pianist David Tudor, and the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. Cage relates several anecdotes about Wolff in his one-minute &quot;Indeterminacy&quot; pieces.

Almost completely self-taught as composer, Wolff studied music under Sultan and Cage. Later Wolff studied classics at Harvard University (BA, PhD) and became an expert on Euripides. Wolff taught Classics at Harvard until 1970; thereafter he taught classics, comparative literature, and music at Dartmouth College. After nine years, he became Strauss Professor of Music there. He retired from teaching at Dartmouth in 1999. In 2004, he received an honorary degree from the California Institute of the Arts. He was also awarded the Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (1996).

Wolff is married and has four children.

==Music==

Wolff&#x27;s early compositional work included a lot of silence and was based initially on complicated rhythmic schema, and later on a system of aural cues. He innovated unique notational methods in his early scores and found creative ways of dealing with improvisation in his music. During the 1960s he developed associations with the composers Frederic Rzewski and Cornelius Cardew who spurred each other on in their respective explorations of experimental composition techniques and musical improvisation, and then, from the early 1970s, in their attempts to engage with political matters in their music. For Wolff this often involved the use of music and texts associated with protest and political movements such as the Wobblies. His later pieces, such as the sequence of pieces &quot;Exercises&quot; (1973-), offer some freedom to the performers. Some works, such as &quot;Changing the System&quot; (1973), &quot;Braverman Music&quot; (1978, after Harry Braverman), and the series of pieces &quot;Peace March&quot; (1983–2005) have an explicit political dimension, in that they respond to contemporary world events and express political ideals.

Wolff collaborated with Merce Cunningham for many years and developed a style which is more common now, but was revolutionary when they began working together in the 1950s – a style where music and dance occur simultaneously, yet somewhat independently of one another. Wolff stated, of any influence or affect, the greatest influence on his music over the years was the choreography of Cunningham. Wolff recently said of his work that it is motivated by his desire &quot;to turn the making of music into a collaborative and transforming activity (performer into composer into listener into composer into performer, etc.), the cooperative character of the activity to the exact source of the music. To stir up, through the production of the music, a sense of social conditions in which we live and of how these might be changed.&quot;

Wolff&#x27;s music reached a new audience when Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;SYR4: Goodbye, 20th Century&quot; featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others, as well as Wolff himself.

<text>The State of Jefferson is a proposed U.S. state that would span the contiguous, mostly rural area of southern Oregon and Northern California, where several attempts to separate from Oregon and California, respectively, have taken place. The region encompasses most of Northern California&#x27;s land but does not include San Francisco or other Bay Area counties that account for the majority of Northern California&#x27;s population.

Although it is assumed that the proposed state is named after Thomas Jefferson, who sponsored the Lewis and Clark Expedition into the Pacific Northwest in 1803, the name &quot;Jefferson&quot; is of uncertain origin. Historians and locals cite Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s status as the primary author of the Declaration of Independence as the origin of the name, with the line &quot;governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed&quot; as evidence of a breakdown of the social contract between the state governments and the region&#x27;s population. However, it is also noted that the name might be a nod to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

If the proposal were ever approved, the new state&#x27;s capital city would have to be determined by a constitutional convention; Yreka, California, was named the provisional capital in the original 1941 proposal, although Port Orford, Oregon, had also been up for consideration, being the former jurisdiction of Mayor Gilbert Gable (one of the movement’s greatest leaders). The movement is strongest in the rural parts of Shasta County, with some supporters of the more recent revival calling for Redding, California, as the potential capital, even though Redding is not included in all versions of the proposal and its city council voted in 2013 to reject participation in the movement.

== 19th century ==
The State of Jefferson has its origins in the 19th century. In , gold discovered in the Klamath River Basin of northwest California extended California&#x27;s gold rush further north to the basin and into the Rogue River Valley of southern Oregon. This led to the first large influx of white settlers in the area, causing conflict with local Native populations that eventually culminated in the Rogue River War of 1855–1856.

Furthermore, this influx of American settlers coupled with the wealth they were able to accumulate from the natural resources of the region spurred several political movements that wanted to separate this region from the rest of California and Oregon in the 1850s. Local politicians proposed an independent State of Shasta to the California legislature in 1852, but the bill died in committee. The State of Shasta was revived again in 1855, and various other configurations of an independent state in the same region as the State of Jefferson were proposed throughout the decade (such as the State of Klamath in 1853 and 1854).

The settlers of the region believed that they were distinct from the rest of California and Oregon both culturally and economically, and that because of the large distance separating them from the capitals of California and Oregon, their needs would be better addressed at the local and federal levels by their own State government than by petitioning the California government. In 1860, Congress passed legislation that would allow the region to vote on whether they wanted to be independent from California and Oregon, but the American Civil War interrupted this process and quelled independence movements for the rest of the 19th century.

James Pogue, in an article for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; noted that calls for secession in the north-west intensified when the Knights of the Golden Circle sent operatives into Oregon. In fact, he notes nobody is sure that the name &quot;Jefferson&quot; is a reference to Thomas Jefferson or if it is a nod to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

==20th century==
In October 1941, the Mayor of Port Orford, Oregon, Gilbert Gable, said that the Oregon counties of Curry, Josephine, Jackson, and Klamath should join with the California counties of Del Norte, Siskiyou, and Modoc to form a new state, later named Jefferson.

He was motivated by the belief that these heavily rural areas were underrepresented in state government, which tended to cater to more populous areas. Gilbert Gable was joined in his efforts by Siskiyou State Senator Randolph Collier, whose support led to Yreka being picked as the capital. Gable persuaded a county court to appoint him to a commission investigating the possibility of secession and his supporters drafted a declaration of independence, and the flag of the movement. In 1941, he and &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporter Stanton Delaplane planned a major publicity push after a night of heavy drinking, but Gable died of a heart attack the next day. Gable&#x27;s supporters then appointed local judge John Childs as “governor” on December 4, 1941 although the movement&#x27;s momentum had slowed with Gable&#x27;s passing.

On November 27, 1941, Delaplane interviewed a group of young men brandishing rifles and pistols who stopped traffic on U.S. Route 99 south of Yreka, the county seat of Siskiyou County, and handed out copies of a Proclamation of Independence, stating that the State of Jefferson was in &quot;patriotic rebellion against the States of California and Oregon&quot; and would continue to &quot;secede every Thursday until further notice.&quot; The men would even stop a California State Trooper telling them to turn around and go back to California. Following U.S. entry into World War II, the initial secessionist movement completely fizzled out.

In 1989, KSOR, the National Public Radio member station based at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, near Medford, rebranded itself as Jefferson Public Radio. It had built a massive network of low-powered translators earlier in the 1980s. By the time KSOR began building full-power stations later in the decade, it realized that the combined footprint of its translator network was roughly coextensive with the original State of Jefferson. It thus felt &quot;Jefferson Public Radio&quot; was an appropriate name when it decided to rebrand itself as a network.

In 1992, California State Assemblyman Stan Statham placed an advisory vote in 31 counties asking if the state should be split into two. All of the proposed Jefferson counties voted in favor of the split (except Humboldt County which did not have the issue on the ballot). Based on these results, Statham introduced legislation in California in an attempt to split the state, but the bill died in committee.

In the late 1990s, the movement for statehood was promoted by a group called the State of Jefferson Citizens Committee, which was originally formed in 1941. Two of the members, Brian Helsaple and Brian Petersen, gathered an extensive collection, including both verbal and written accounts mostly surrounding the 1941 movement. In 2000, they published &quot;Jefferson Saga&quot;, a book detailing the lack of representation of the region.

==21st century==
Jefferson is commemorated by the State of Jefferson Scenic Byway between Yreka and O&#x27;Brien, Oregon, which runs along State Route 96 and U.S. Forest Service Primary Route 48. Near the California – Oregon border, a turnout provides scenic views of the Klamath River valley and three informative display signs about the republic. The region retains this identity reinforced by institutions such as Jefferson Public Radio.

The Jefferson secession movement would be revived as a serious movement in 2013 by Mark Baird, a rancher and former sheriff’s deputy in Siskiyou County who was concerned with the regions lack of representation in the state government. He often cited a forestry policy that prevented most of northern California’s federally managed forests from being logged, which had more or less wiped out the region’s economic base. Baird argued that Jefferson&#x27;s statehood would give the region footing to negotiate with the federal government to revise this policy.

As of the 2020 Census, if the Jefferson counties were a state (original 1941 counties), the state&#x27;s population would be 484,727: smaller than any state at the time. Approximately 83% of those residents live in Oregon. Its land area would be – a little smaller than West Virginia. The area was almost evenly divided between Oregon and California. Its population density would be – a little more than Idaho. With the addition of the more modern Jefferson movement (Coos and Douglas and Lake Counties in Oregon, and Humboldt, Trinity, Shasta, Lassen, Mendocino, Lake, Tehama, Plumas, Glenn, Butte, Colusa, Sierra, Sutter, Yuba, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Calaveras, Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and Mariposa Counties in California), the population as of the 2020 Census would be 3,138,324, making it the 33rd most populous state in the United States.

===Counties intending to leave California===
On September 3, 2013, the Siskiyou County, California Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 in favor of withdrawal from California to form a proposed state named Jefferson. The proposal was joined by the Modoc County Board of Supervisors (September 24) and Glenn County Board of Supervisors (January 21, 2014). On April 15, 2014 Yuba County Supervisors joined the State of Jefferson movement to separate from California and create a new U.S. state. On July 15, 2014, the Tehama County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to adopt a resolution supporting the declaration of withdrawal from California based on an advisory vote taken on June 6, 2014, where the public voted 56% to 44% in favor of splitting the state. On July 22, 2014, the Board of Supervisors of Sutter County unanimously adopted a resolution supporting a declaration and petition to the Legislature to withdraw from California to redress a lack of representation. On March 3, 2015, Lake County supervisors voted 3 to 2 to submit the question of secession to voters and on March 17, Lassen County supervisors made a similar declaration that also has the voters deciding in 2016. The Jefferson Declaration Committee is reportedly aiming to get at least 12 counties in support.

On October 24, 2014, Modoc and Siskiyou Counties delivered their declarations for independence from the state of California to the California Secretary of State&#x27;s office. On January 15, 2015, three more counties, Glenn, Tehama, and Yuba, submitted their official declarations as well.

The 2013 revival was based almost entirely in California. It includes all major parts of California north of 39°. Although some individual residents in Oregon have lobbied for the movement, no county government in that state has endorsed the proposal to date. As of January 6, 2016, 21 northern California counties have sent a declaration or have approved to send a declaration to the State of California with their intent of leaving the state and forming the State of Jefferson. The population of the 21 California counties was 1,747,626 as of the 2010 U.S. Census, which would be 39th most populous state in the Union.

In 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper launched Six Californias, a measure to split California into six consecutive parts, including Jefferson. Draper announced that 1.3 million people had signed the petition; however, a third of the signatures were later found to be invalid, thus placing the signature count below the needed threshold to qualify for the 2016 ballot.

===2016 presidential election===
In the 2016 presidential election, most of the rural California counties which would belong to the State of Jefferson were won by Republican nominee Donald Trump, whereas the losing candidate, Democrat Hillary Clinton, enjoyed support in the rest of California, especially among the low income &amp; highly-educated urban area voters. While Clinton beat Trump by almost 80 points in San Francisco, he led her by more than 50 points in Lassen County. The election of Trump led to calls for a secession of California from the Union and a similar proposal in Oregon, where Clinton won the popular vote while Trump captured the majority of counties.

With the election of President Donald Trump, some who are considering joining the modern State of Jefferson or are observing the movement have stated that if California secedes, the movement&#x27;s supporting counties could appeal directly to the United States Congress for statehood, similar to how West Virginia was formed, claiming California would be in insurrection and petitioning to rejoin the Union as an independent state.

On May 8, 2017, the pro-Jefferson group &quot;Citizens for Fair Representation&quot; filed a lawsuit against California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. The suit alleges that California&#x27;s 1862 law limiting Senators to no more than 40, and Assembly Members to no more than 80, creates an unconstitutional imbalance of representation that precludes effective &quot;self-governance&quot; as protected by the 14th Amendment. The desired result of suing California, for lack of representation and dilution of vote, is better representation across all of California, and ultimately an independent State of Jefferson. The case was dismissed by the lower court and appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal.

===COVID-19===

During the COVID-19 pandemic the issue of Jefferson&#x27;s secession flared up again. The Shasta County Board of Supervisors pledged to ignore state public health order with a public hearing claiming that vaccines are a health hazard, masks are a form of government control, the pandemic is a hoax to sway the 2020 election against Donald Trump with activists reading out the home address of health officer’s enforcing lockdowns, calling for their citizen&#x27;s arrest. At the same time a Shasta County militia, calling for secession and armed resistance to COVID-19 regulations saw a massive influx in membership. This would culminate in the election of anti-government leaders in Shasta County in northern California to the Shasta board of supervisors who campaigned on Jefferson secession.

During the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election the counties of a would-be Jefferson overwhelmingly voted in favor of recalling Gavin Newsom with some counties voting 6 to 1 in favor of recall. The week prior to the recall vote the Greater Idaho movement successfully held referendums in five counties in Oregon calling for joining Idaho for much the same reasons as the State of Jefferson&#x27;s pursuit of secession from California. Some of the counties of the Greater Idaho movement and the State of Jefferson overlap, and the Greater Idaho movement stated that the annexation of Northern California into Idaho was &quot;Phase Two&quot; of the movement.

== Flag and seal ==

The field of the flag is green, and the charge is the Seal of the State of Jefferson: a yellow circle representing a gold mining pan, with the words &quot;The Great Seal Of State Of Jefferson&quot; engraved into the lip, and two capital, black Xs askew of each other. The two Xs are known as the &quot;Double Cross&quot; and signify the two regions&#x27; &quot;sense of abandonment&quot; by the central state governments, in both Southern Oregon and Northern California.

The gold pan that was ostensibly the first model for the state&#x27;s seal is on display at the Siskiyou County Museum in Yreka, California.

<doc id="241981" wikidata="Q193257" url="?curid=241981" title="Jean-François Lyotard">
<text>Jean-François Lyotard (; ; 10 August 1924 – 21 April 1998) was a French philosopher, sociologist, and literary theorist. His interdisciplinary discourse spans such topics as epistemology and communication, the human body, modern art and postmodern art, literature and critical theory, music, film, time and memory, space, the city and landscape, the sublime, and the relation between aesthetics and politics. He is best known for his articulation of postmodernism after the late 1970s and the analysis of the impact of postmodernity on the human condition. Lyotard was a key personality in contemporary continental philosophy and authored 26 books and many articles. He was a director of the International College of Philosophy founded by Jacques Derrida, François Châtelet, Jean-Pierre Faye, and Dominique Lecourt.

==Biography==

=== Early life, educational background, and family ===

Jean François Lyotard was born on 10 August 1924, in Versailles, France, to Jean-Pierre Lyotard, a sales representative, and Madeleine Cavalli. He went to school at the Lycée Buffon (1935–42) and Louis-le-Grand, Paris. As a child, Lyotard had many aspirations: to be an artist, a historian, a Dominican friar, and a writer. He later gave up the dream of becoming a writer when he finished writing an unsuccessful fictional novel at the age of 15. Ultimately, Lyotard described the realization that he would not become any of these occupations because of &quot;fate&quot;, as he describes in his intellectual biography called &quot;Peregrinations&quot;, published in 1988.

Lyotard served as a medic during the liberation of Paris in the Second World War, and soon after began studying philosophy at the Sorbonne in the late 1940s, after failing the entrance exam to the more prestigious École normale supérieure twice. His 1947 DES thesis, &quot;Indifference as an Ethical Concept&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;indifférence comme notion éthique&quot;), analyzed forms of indifference and detachment in Zen Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Epicureanism. He studied for the agrégation at the Sorbonne alongside fellow students Gilles Deleuze, Francois Châtelet and Michel Butor; in 1949 whilst waiting to retake the oral examination, he left Paris to teach at l’École militaire préparatoire d’Autun. Having gained the agrégation in 1950, Lyotard took up a position teaching philosophy at the Lycée d&#x27;Aumale (now Lycée Ahmed Reda Houhou) in Constantine in French Algeria but returned to mainland France in 1952 to teach at the Prytanée military academy in La Flèche, where he wrote a short work on Phenomenology, published in 1954. Lyotard moved to Paris in 1959 to teach at the Sorbonne: introductory lectures from this time (1964) have been posthumously published under the title &quot;Why Philosophize?&quot; Having moved to teach at the new campus of Nanterre in 1966, Lyotard participated in the events following March 22 and the tumult of May 1968. In 1971, Lyotard earned a State doctorate with his dissertation &quot;Discours, figure&quot; under Mikel Dufrenne—the work was published the same year. Lyotard joined the Philosophy department of the experimental University at Vincennes, later Paris 8, together with Gilles Deleuze, in the academic year 1970-71; it remained his academic home in France until 1987. He married his first wife, Andrée May, in 1948 with whom he had two children, Corinne and Laurence, and later married for a second time in 1993 to Dolores Djidzek, the mother of his son David (born in 1986).

===Political life===

In 1954, Lyotard became a member of &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; (&quot;Socialism or Barbarism&quot;), a French political organization formed in 1948 around the inadequacy of the Trotskyist analysis to explain the new forms of domination in the Soviet Union. &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; and the publication of the same name had an objective to conduct a critique of Marxism from within the left, including the dominance of bureaucracy within the French Communist Party and its adherence to the dictats of the Soviet Union. His writings in this period are mostly concerned with far-left politics, with a focus on the Algerian situation—which he witnessed first-hand while teaching philosophy in Constantine. As the principal correspondent on Algeria for &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;, during the period of Algeria&#x27;s struggle for independence, Lyotard wrote a dozen essays analyzing the economic and political situation (1956–63), which were later reproduced in &quot;La Guerre des Algeriens&quot; (1989) and translated in &quot;Political Writings&quot; (1993). Lyotard hoped to encourage an Algerian fight for independence from France, and a social revolution, actively supporting the FLN in secret, whilst also being critical of its approach. Following disputes with Cornelius Castoriadis in 1964, Lyotard left &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; for the newly formed splinter group &quot;Pouvoir Ouvrier&quot; (&quot;Worker Power&quot;), from which he resigned in turn in 1966. Although Lyotard played an active part in the May 1968 uprisings, he distanced himself from revolutionary Marxism with his 1974 book &quot;Libidinal Economy&quot;. He distanced himself from Marxism because he felt that Marxism had a rigid structuralist approach and they were imposing &quot;systematization of desires&quot; through a strong emphasis on industrial production as the ground culture.

===Academic career===
Lyotard taught at the , Algeria from 1950 to 1952. In 1952, Lyotard returned to mainland France to teach at the Prytanée military academy, La Flèche, Sarthe. He published the book &quot;La phénoménologie&quot; (&quot;Phenomenology&quot;) in 1954 and began to write for the journal &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot; under the pseudonym François Laborde. Returning to Paris in 1959 Lyotard taught first at the Sorbonne, then moving to its recently created Nanterre campus in 1966. In 1970, Lyotard began teaching in the Philosophy department of the Experimental University Centre, Vincennes, which became the University of Paris VIII in 1971; he taught there until 1987 when he became Professor Emeritus. In 1982-3 Lyotard was involved in the foundation of the Collège International de Philosophie, Paris, serving as its second Director in 1985. Lyotard frequently lectured outside France as visiting professor at universities around the world. From 1974, these included trans-Atlantic visits, including: Johns Hopkins University, University of California, Berkeley, Yale University, Stony Brook University and the University of California, San Diego in the U.S., the Université de Montréal in Quebec (Canada), and the University of São Paulo in Brazil. In 1987 he took a part-time professorship at the University of California, Irvine where he held a joint post with Jacques Derrida and Wolfgang Iser in the Department of Critical Theory. Before his death, he split his time between Paris and Atlanta, where he taught at Emory University as the Woodruff Professor of Philosophy and French from 1995-8. He was also a professor of Media Philosophy at The European Graduate School.

=== Later life and death ===
Later works that Lyotard wrote were about French writer, activist, and politician, André Malraux. One of them was a biography, &quot;Signed, Malraux&quot;, another an essay entitled &quot;Soundproof Room&quot;. Lyotard was interested in the aesthetic views of society that Malraux shared. Another later Lyotard book was &quot;The Confession of Augustine&quot;: a study in the phenomenology of time. This work-in-progress was published posthumously in the same year of Lyotard&#x27;s death. Two of his later essays on art were on the artwork of artist Bracha L. Ettinger: Anima Minima (Diffracted Traces), 1995, and Anamnesis (L&#x27;anamnese), 1997.

Lyotard repeatedly returned to the notion of the Postmodern in essays gathered in English as &quot;The Postmodern Explained to Children&quot;, &quot;Toward the Postmodern&quot;, and &quot;Postmodern Fables&quot;. In 1998, while preparing for a conference on postmodernism and media theory, he died unexpectedly from a case of leukemia that had advanced rapidly. He is buried in Division 6 of Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Work==

Lyotard&#x27;s work is characterized by a persistent opposition to universals, métarécits (meta-narratives), and generality. He is fiercely critical of many of the &quot;universalist&quot; claims of the Enlightenment, and several of his works serve to undermine the fundamental principles that generate these broad claims.

In his writings of the early 1970s, Lyotard rejects what he regards as theological underpinnings of both Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud: &quot;In Freud, it is Judaical, critical sombre (forgetful of the political); in Marx it is catholic. Hegelian, reconciliatory (...) in the one and in the other the relationship of the economic with meaning is blocked in the category of representation (...) Here a politics, there a therapeutics, in both cases a laical theology, on top of the arbitrariness and the roaming of forces&quot;. Consequently, he rejected Theodor W. Adorno&#x27;s negative dialectics because he viewed them as seeking a &quot;therapeutic resolution in the framework of a religion, here the religion of history.&quot; In Lyotard&#x27;s &quot;libidinal economics&quot; he aimed at &quot;discovering and describing different social modes of investment of libidinal intensities&quot;.

=== Academic legacy ===
Throughout his academic career Jean-François Lyotard has contributed to the magazines &quot;L&#x27;Âge nouveau&quot;, &quot;Les Temps modernes&quot;, &quot;Socialisme ou barbarie&quot;, &quot;Cahiers de philosophie&quot;, &quot;Esprit&quot;, &quot;Revue d&#x27;esthétique&quot;, &quot;Musique en jeu&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Art vivant&quot;, &quot;Semiotexte&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, &quot;Art Press International&quot;, &quot;Critique&quot;, &quot;Flash Art&quot;, &quot;Art Forum&quot;, &quot;Po&amp;sie&quot;, among others.

===&quot;Discourse, Figure&quot; (1971)===
Submitted as his &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;Etat&quot; (Higher State Doctorate), this complex work was not available in English until 2011. It is unusual in form and contents, covering aspects of aesthetics (Merleau-Ponty), linguistics (Benveniste, Lacan), psychoanalysis (Freud), poetry (Michel Butor, Stéphane Mallarmé), and painting (Italian Quattrocento; Paul Cézanne, Paul Klee; Jackson Pollock). The focus shifts from phenomenology to an engagement with psychoanalysis, in order to make the form of the book work differently to the usual expectations for an academic text of the time and to disorientate the reader. Its reception has been delayed in the Anglophone world, missing the importance Lyotard attributed to it, considering it one of his three &#x27;real books&#x27; and the principal reference for his discussion of the &#x27;figural&#x27; and its tri-part presentation (figure-image; figure-form; figure-matrix).

==== Aesthetics ====
Lyotard&#x27;s thesis, published under the title &quot;Discours, Figure&quot; (1971), focused on aesthetics. Lyotard devoted himself a lot to aesthetic issues, in a way that sought to break with the Hegelian perspective, in which art had to think of itself as a materialization of the mind. He believed it was &quot;more a tool to expose often unseen tensions, shifts, and complications in philosophical thinking and its relations with society--a way of helping it depart from &quot;doxa&quot; without the assurances of higher knowledge or even a &quot;sensus communis.&quot;&quot; Lyotard&#x27;s thought on modern and contemporary art focused on a few artists who allowed him to emphasize the flagship issues of French thought after the Second World War, particularly those of conceptual mastery of the artist as an author: Paul Cézanne and Wassily Kandinsky as well as Bracha L. Ettinger, Albert Ayme, Daniel Buren, Marcel Duchamp, Valerio Adami, Jacques Monory, Shusaku Arakawa, Ruth Francken, Sam Francis, Barnett Newman, Joseph Kosuth, Karel Appel, René Guiffrey, Manuel Casimiro and Gianfranco Baruchello.

===&quot;Libidinal Economy&quot; (1974)===

In one of Lyotard&#x27;s most famous books, &quot;Libidinal Economy&quot;, he offers a critique of Marx&#x27;s idea of &quot;false consciousness&quot; and claims that the 19th-century working class enjoyed being a part of the industrialization process. Lyotard claims that this was due to libidinal energythe term &quot;libidinal&quot; coming from the term &quot;libido&quot;, used in psychoanalysis to refer to the desires of a deeper consciousness. &quot;Libidinal Economy&quot; has been called an achievement in attempting to live with the rejection of all religious and moral principles through an undermining of the structures associated with it. Structures conceal libidinal intensities while intense feelings and desires stave off set structures. However, there also can be no intensities or desires without structures, because there would be no dream of escaping the repressive structures if they do not exist. &quot;Libidinal energy comes from this disruptive intervention of external events within structures that seek order and self-containment.&quot; This was the first of Lyotard&#x27;s writings that had really criticized a Marxist view. It achieved great success, but was also the last of Lyotard&#x27;s writings on this particular topic where he really opposed the views of Marx.

===&quot;The Postmodern Condition&quot; (1979)===
Lyotard is a skeptic of modern cultural thought. According to his 1979 &quot;The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge&quot;, the impact of the postmodern condition was to provoke skepticism about universalizing theories. Lyotard argues that people have outgrown their needs for metanarratives (), likely due to the advancement of techniques and technologies since World War II and redeployment of advanced liberal capitalism (i.e., neoliberalism). He argues against the possibility of justifying the narratives that bring together disciplines and social practices, such as science and culture; according to James Williams, for Lyotard &quot;the narratives we tell to justify a single set of laws and stakes are inherently unjust.&quot; Lyotard further claims &quot;even under fascism, politics is a matter of opinions and hence values.&quot; A loss of faith in metanarratives has an effect on how people view science, art, and literature. Little narratives have now become the appropriate way for explaining social transformations and political problems. Lyotard argues that this is the driving force behind postmodern science. As metanarratives fade, science suffers a loss of faith in its search for truth, and therefore must find other ways of legitimating its efforts. Connected to this scientific legitimacy is the growing dominance for information machines. Lyotard argues that one day, in order for knowledge to be considered useful, it will have to be converted into computerized data. Years later, this led him into writing his book &quot;The Inhuman&quot;, published in 1988, in which he illustrates a world where technology has taken over.

===The collapse of the &quot;grand narrative&quot; and &quot;language-games&quot;===

Most famously, in &quot;La Condition postmoderne: Rapport sur le savoir (The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge)&quot; (1979), he proposes what he calls an extreme simplification of the &quot;postmodern&quot; as an &#x27;incredulity towards meta-narratives&#x27;. These meta-narratives—sometimes &#x27;grand narratives&#x27;—are grand, large-scale theories and philosophies of the world, such as the progress of history, the knowability of everything by science, and the possibility of absolute freedom. Lyotard argues that people have ceased to believe that narratives of this kind are adequate to represent and contain human multiplicity. He points out that no one seemed to agree on what, if anything, was real and everyone had their own perspective and story. People have become alert to difference, diversity, the incompatibility of human aspirations, beliefs, and desires, and for that reason postmodernity is characterized by an abundance of micronarratives. For this concept, Lyotard draws from the notion of &quot;language-games&quot; found in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Lyotard notes that it is based on the mapping of society according to the concept of the language games.

In Lyotard&#x27;s works, the term &quot;language games&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;phrase regimens&quot;, denotes the multiplicity of communities of meaning, the innumerable and incommensurable separate systems in which meanings are produced and rules for their circulation are created. This involves, for example, an incredulity towards the metanarrative of human emancipation.

That is, the story of how the human race has set itself free. That brings together the language game of science, the language game of human historical conflicts, and the language game of human qualities into the overall justification of the steady development of the human race in terms of wealth and moral well-being.

According to this metanarrative, the justification of science is related to wealth and education. The development of history is seen as steady progress towards civilization or moral well-being. The language game of human passions, qualities and faults (c.f. character flaws (narratives)), is seen as steadily shifting in favor of qualities and away from faults as science and historical developments help to conquer faults in favor of qualities. The point is that any event ought to be able to be understood in terms of the justifications of this metanarrative; anything that happens can be understood and judged according to the discourse of human emancipation. For example, for any new social, political or scientific revolution, people could ask themselves the question, &quot;Is this revolution a step towards the greater well-being of the mass of human beings?&quot; It should always be possible to answer this question in terms of the rules of justification of the metanarrative of human emancipation.

This becomes more crucial in &quot;Au juste: Conversations (Just Gaming)&quot; (1979) and &quot;Le Différend (The Differend)&quot; (1983), which develop a postmodern theory of justice. It might appear that the atomization of human beings implied by the notion of the micronarrative and the language game suggests a collapse of ethics. It has often been thought that universality is a condition for something to be a properly ethical statement: &quot;thou shalt not steal&quot; is an ethical statement in a way that &quot;thou shalt not steal from Margaret&quot; is not. The latter is too particular to be an ethical statement (what&#x27;s so special about Margaret?); it is only ethical if it rests on a universal statement (&quot;thou shalt not steal from anyone&quot;). But universals are impermissible in a world that has lost faith in metanarratives, and so it would seem that ethics is impossible. Justice and injustice can only be terms within language games, and the universality of ethics is out of the window. Lyotard argues that notions of justice and injustice do in fact remain in postmodernism. The new definition of injustice is indeed to use the language rules from one &quot;phrase regimen&quot; and apply them to another. Ethical behavior is about remaining alert precisely to the threat of this injustice, about paying attention to things in their particularity and not enclosing them within abstract conceptuality. One must bear witness to the &quot;differend&quot;. In a differend, there is a conflict between two parties that cannot be solved in a just manner. However, the act of being able to bridge the two and understand the claims of both parties, is the first step towards finding a solution.

&quot;I would like to call a differend the case where the plaintiff is divested of the means to argue and becomes for that reason a victim. If the addressor, the addressee, and the sense of the testimony are neutralized, everything takes place as if there were no damages. A case of differend between two parties takes place when the regulation of the conflict that opposes them is done in the idiom of one of the parties while the wrong suffered by the other is not signified in that idiom.&quot;
In more than one book, Lyotard promoted what he called a new paganism. Plato, in Book II of the &quot;Republic&quot;, condemns pagans for their shape-shifting and deceitful gods, antithetical to universal truth. Lyotard prefers a mirror image of Plato&#x27;s critique, vindicating the pagans as Plato sees them. A new paganism would revolt against a Greek masculinist, such as that of Plato. The revolt would be led by women, for woman is antirational and anti-philosophical (at least as Plato understands what it is to be philosophical). Woman, as &quot;the little girl&quot;, is &quot;the antonym of the adult male questioner&quot; and would serve as a release from the mental illness evident in Platonic philosophy, in Judaism and in the American, French and Russian revolutions.

===&quot;The Differend&quot; (1983)===

In &quot;The Differend&quot;, based on Immanuel Kant&#x27;s views on the separation of Understanding, Judgment, and Reason, Lyotard identifies the moment in which language fails as the differend, and explains it as follows: &quot;...the unstable state and instant of language wherein something which must be able to be put into phrases cannot yet be… the human beings who thought they could use language as an instrument of communication, learn through the feeling of pain which accompanies silence (and of pleasure which accompanies the invention of a new idiom)&quot;. Lyotard undermines the common view that the meanings of phrases can be determined by what they refer to (the referent). The meaning of a phrase—an event (something happens)—cannot be fixed by appealing to reality (what actually happened). Lyotard develops this view of language by defining &quot;reality&quot; in an original way, as a complex of possible senses attached to a referent through a name. The correct sense of a phrase cannot be determined by a reference to reality, since the referent itself does not fix sense, and reality itself is defined as the complex of competing senses attached to a referent. Therefore, the phrase event remains indeterminate.

Lyotard uses the example of Auschwitz and the revisionist historian Robert Faurisson’s demands for proof of the Holocaust to show how the differend operates as a double bind. Faurisson argued that &quot;the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jewish people was a hoax and a swindle, rather than a historical fact&quot; and that &quot;he was one of the courageous few willing to expose this wicked conspiracy&quot;. Faurisson will only accept proof of the existence of gas chambers from eyewitnesses who were themselves victims of the gas chambers. However, any such eyewitnesses are dead and are not able to testify. Either there were no gas chambers, in which case there would be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, or there were gas chambers, in which case there would still be no eyewitnesses to produce evidence, because they would be dead. Since Faurisson will accept no evidence for the existence of gas chambers, except the testimony of actual victims, he will conclude from both possibilities (gas chambers existed and gas chambers did not exist) that gas chambers did not exist. This presents a double bind. There are two alternatives, either there were gas chambers or there were not, which lead to the same conclusion: there were no gas chambers (and no final solution). The case is a differend because the harm done to the victims cannot be presented in the standard of judgment upheld by Faurisson.

===The sublime===
Lyotard was a frequent writer on aesthetic matters. He was, despite his reputation as a postmodernist, a great promoter of modernist art. Lyotard saw postmodernism as a latent tendency within thought throughout time and not a narrowly limited historical period. He favored the startling and perplexing works of the high modernist avant-garde. In them he found a demonstration of the limits of human conceptuality, a valuable lesson for anyone too imbued with Enlightenment confidence. Lyotard has written extensively also on many contemporary artists of his choice: Valerio Adami, Daniel Buren, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Monory, Ruth Francken, Shusaku Arakawa, Bracha Ettinger, Sam Francis, Karel Appel, Barnett Newman, René Guiffrey, Gianfranco Baruchello, and Albert Ayme as well as on earlier artists, notably Paul Cézanne and Paul Klee.

He developed these themes in particular by discussing the sublime. The &quot;sublime&quot; is a term in aesthetics whose fortunes revived under postmodernism after a century or more of neglect. It refers to the experience of pleasurable anxiety that people experience when confronting wild and threatening sights like, for example, a massive craggy mountain, black against the sky, looming terrifyingly. A sublime is the conjunction of two opposed feelings, which makes it harder to see the injustice of it, or a solution to it.

Lyotard found particularly interesting the explanation of the sublime offered by Immanuel Kant in his &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; (&quot;Kritik der Urtheilskraft&quot;, more exactly &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot;). In this book, Kant explains this mixture of anxiety and pleasure in the following terms: there are two kinds of &quot;sublime&quot; experience. In the &quot;mathematically&quot; sublime, an object strikes the mind in such a way that people find themselves unable to take it in as a whole. More precisely, they experience a clash between their reason (which tells them that all objects are finite) and the imagination (the aspect of the mind that governs perception, and which sees an object incalculably larger than themselves, and feels infinite). In the &quot;dynamically&quot; sublime, the mind recoils at an object so immeasurably more powerful than the individual, whose weight, force, scale could crush a person without the remotest hope of being able to resist it. (Kant stresses that if a person is in &quot;actual&quot; danger, their feeling of anxiety is very different from that of a sublime feeling. The sublime is an aesthetic experience, not a practical feeling of personal danger.) This explains the feeling of anxiety.

What is deeply unsettling about the mathematically sublime is that the mental faculties that present visual perceptions to the mind are inadequate to the concept corresponding to it; in other words, what people are able to make themselves see cannot fully match up to what they know is there. They know it is a mountain but they cannot take the whole thing into their perception. Human sensibility is incapable of coping with such sights, but reason can assert the finitude of the presentation. With the dynamically sublime, the sense of physical danger should prompt an awareness that humans are not just physical material beings, but moral and (in Kant&#x27;s terms) noumenal beings as well. The body may be dwarfed by its power but reason need not be. This explains, in both cases, why the sublime is an experience of pleasure as well as pain.

Lyotard is fascinated by this admission, from one of the philosophical architects of the Enlightenment, that the mind cannot always organize the world rationally. Some objects are simply incapable of being brought neatly under concepts. For Lyotard, in &quot;Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime&quot;, but drawing on his argument in &quot;The Differend&quot;, this is a good thing. Such generalities as &quot;concepts&quot; fail to pay proper attention to the particularity of things. What happens in the sublime is a crisis where a person realizes the inadequacy of the imagination and reason to each other. What people are witnessing, says Lyotard, is actually the differend; the straining of the mind at the edges of itself and at the edges of its conceptuality.

===&quot;Les Immatériaux&quot; (1985)===
In 1985, Lyotard co-curated the exhibition &quot;Les Immatériaux&quot; at the Centre de Création Industrielle at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, together with the design theorist and curator Thierry Chaput. At that point, &quot;Les Immatériaux&quot; was the largest exhibition held at the Centre Georges Pompidou. The exhibition was framed in a pre-1989 context that predicted globalization to be a melancholy foreshadowing of contemporary art&#x27;s shifting function in the era of increasing transnational exchange, and as a turning point in a history of exhibits in the aftermath of what was formerly known as aesthetics.

John Rajchman says this about the exhibition: &quot;We might imagine Les Immatériaux as an extravagant staging of a peculiar moment in the role of information in the history of aesthetics after so-called ‘modernism’, yet before the ‘contemporary’ configuration of biennials that was already taking shape in the 1990s, within or against which the question of a new ‘history of exhibition’ now itself arises.&quot; In 2023 a display about the exhibition was held at the Centre Georges Pompidou, including examples of some of the works included, a selection of films shown at the original accompanying ciné immatériaux programme, and a virtual re-creation of the exhibition featuring remastered sound from the original exhibition sound track.

=== &quot;The Inhuman&quot; (1988) ===
In his book, &quot;The Inhuman&quot;, Lyotard explores the philosophy of Kant, Heidegger, Adorno, and Derrida, as well as the works of modernist and postmodernist artists like Cézanne, Debussy, and Boulez, in a wide-ranging debate. Time and memory, the sublime and the avant-garde, and the link between aesthetics and politics are all topics Lyotard addresses in the book. In his study he analyzes the close but problematic ties between modernity, development, and humanity, as well as the shift to postmodernity. The job of literature, philosophy, and the arts, according to Lyotard, is to give witness to and explain this arduous shift.

Lyotard rejected classical humanism mainly because he paradoxically assumes that the humane is something that every person has inherently from birth but can only be realized through education. Lyotard essentially asks if humanity is so inherent to all humans, can it only be gained by undergoing education? By using the concept of the inhuman, Lyotard described all those things that humanism has excluded from its definition of man.

He developed a science-fiction thought experiment that would take place in 4.5 billion years, at the time of the explosion of the sun. Should the human species put itself in the position to live on without Earth, and if so what would then remain of &quot;humanity&quot;? Everything that is of importance for the determination of what is &quot;human&quot; would fall away if the human species began living an extra-planetary existence. Lyotard&#x27;s opinion on this remained divided: on the one hand, he criticized the dehumanizing effects of modern technology that can already be observed today; on the other hand, he saw in them the chance to open up a space of possibilities, since they do not fix the human being to one image.

=== &quot;Readings in Infancy&quot; (1991) ===
First published by Galilée, Paris, in 1991 the volume appeared in full English translation in 2023 (Bloomsbury) edited by Robert Harvey and Kiff Bamford. This is a collection of essays on works by key figures from literature, politics and psychoanalysis: James Joyce; Franz Kafka; Hannah Arendt; Jean-Paul Sartre; Paul Valéry; Sigmund Freud are the vehicles for a meditation on the speechless &quot;infans&quot; of infancy (&quot;enfance&quot;). Read together, these chapters form an investigation into the area of research which preoccupied Lyotard throughout the last two decades of his life, named here as &quot;infantia&quot;, the infancy of thought: that which resists development, whether human, capitalist or technological. As Lyotard writes in the chapter &#x27;Voices: Freud&#x27;: &quot;Writing has a debt of affect which it despairs of ever being able to pay off.&quot;

===&quot;Mainmise&quot;===
Lyotard was impressed by the importance of childhood in human life, which he saw as providing the opportunity of creativity, as opposed to the settled hubris of maturity. In &quot;Mainmise&quot; (1992), however, he also explored the hold of childhood experience on the individual through the (Roman) concept of , an authoritative right of possession. Because parental influences affect the new-born before it has the linguistic skill even to articulate them, let alone oppose them, Lyotard considered that &quot;We are born from others but also to others, given over defenseless to them. Subject to their &quot;mancipium&quot;.&quot; The essay &quot;Mainmise&quot; was collected in the 1993 publication &quot;D&#x27;un trait d&#x27;union&quot; (The Hyphen: Between Judaism and Christianity, 1999) together with &#x27;On a Hyphen&#x27; and responses and correspondence with Eberhard Gruber. In France it was also collected in the posthumously published collection &quot;Misère de la philosophie&quot; (The Poverty of Philosophy, no English translation available) edited by Dolorès Lyotard.

==Criticism==

There are three major criticisms of Lyotard&#x27;s work. Each coincides with a school of thought. Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy have written deconstructions of Lyotard&#x27;s work (Derrida 1992; Nancy 1985). They focus on Lyotard&#x27;s postmodern work and on &quot;The Differend&quot; in particular. A differend depends upon a distinction drawn between groups that itself depends upon the heterogeneity of language games and genres of discourse. Why should these differences be privileged over an endless division and reconstruction of groups? In concentrating on specific differences, Lyotard&#x27;s thought becomes overly dependent on differences; between categories that are given as fixed and well defined. From the point of view of deconstruction, Lyotard&#x27;s philosophy gives too much credit to illegitimate categories and groups. Underlying any differend there is a multiplicity of further differences; some of these will involve crossing the first divide, others will question the integrity of the groups that were originally separated.

Manfred Frank (1988) has put the Frankfurt School criticism best. He attacks Lyotard&#x27;s search for division over consensus on the grounds that it involves a philosophical mistake with serious political and social repercussions. Lyotard has failed to notice that an underlying condition for consensus is also a condition for the successful communication of his own thought. It is a performative contradiction to give an account that appeals to reason on behalf of a difference that is supposed to elude it. So, in putting forward a false argument against a rational consensus, Lyotard plays into the hands of the irrational forces that often give rise to injustice. Worse, he is then only in a position to testify to that injustice, rather than put forward a just and rational resolution. In turn, these criticisms have been met with responses arguing that Frank misreads Lyotard&#x27;s work, for example, failing to recognize the role of the sublime, as well as failing to see that Lyotard wants to go beyond the monopoly of the cognitive, argumentative genre, in order to give other genres a right to exist as well.

From a Nietzschean and Deleuzian point of view (James Williams 2000), Lyotard&#x27;s postmodern philosophy took a turn toward a destructive modern nihilism that his early work avoids.

Charles J. Stivale reviewed Lyotard&#x27;s &quot;The Differend&quot; (in English translation) in 1990, stating:
==Influence==
The collective tribute to Lyotard following his death was organized by the Collège International de Philosophie, and chaired by Dolores Lyotard and Jean-Claude Milner, the College&#x27;s director at that time. The proceedings were published by PUF in 2001 under the general title &quot;Jean-François Lyotard, l&#x27;exercice du différend&quot;.

Lyotard&#x27;s work continues to be important in politics, philosophy, sociology, literature, art, and cultural studies. To mark the tenth anniversary of Lyotard&#x27;s death, an international symposium about Jean-François Lyotard organized by the Collège International de Philosophie (under the direction of Dolores Lyotard, Jean-Claude Milner and Gerald Sfez) was held in Paris from January 25–27 in 2007.

== Miscellaneous ==

* In Pierre Gripari&#x27;s novel &quot;Pierrot la lune&quot;, he writes about a Lyotard, who is given the name &quot;Jef&quot; in the novel, saying that he was the only person with whom he could open up about his homosexuality: &quot;I do not understand Jef, but I need him.&quot;
*In a 1984 interview with Georges Van Den Abbeele, Lyotard discusses how he views all the work he&#x27;s published as rough drafts, noting that, &quot;Even &quot;Le différend&quot; (1984), which I spent nine years elaborating and writing, remains a sketch, whose master I have not been. And in this sense, I can without lying plead limited responsibility. That is to say: a reader cannot incorrectly locate in a piece of writing an aspect which, according to me, is not at all there.&quot;
* Lyotard was quoted as having privately said, in a conversation with David Hawkes, that &quot;capital is the enemy&quot;.
* A short study (176 pp) of Lyotard&#x27;s life and work is published in the series Critical Lives by Reaktion Books, London, it is the only Biography of Lyotard currently available.

<doc id="241982" wikidata="Q1759522" url="?curid=241982" title="Hit-and-run tactics">
<text>Hit-and-run tactics are a tactical doctrine of using short surprise attacks, withdrawing before the enemy can respond in force, and constantly maneuvering to avoid full engagement with the enemy. The purpose is not to decisively defeat the enemy or capture territory but to weaken enemy forces over time through raids, harassment, and skirmishing and limiting risk to friendly forces. Such tactics can also expose enemy defensive weaknesses and achieve a psychological effect on the enemy&#x27;s morale.

Hit-and-run is a favored tactic where the enemy overmatches the attacking force and any sustained combat is to be avoided, such as guerrilla warfare, militant resistance movements, and terrorism. However, 
regular army forces often employ hit-and-run tactics in the short term, usually in preparation for a later full-scale engagement with the enemy when and where conditions are more favorable. Examples of the latter include commando or other special forces attacks, reconnaissance-in-force, or sorties from a fortress, castle, or other strongpoint. Hit-and-run tactics were also used by the lightly-armed horse archers, typical of the Eurasian steppe peoples, who excelled at them. That holds especially true for such troops that were not part of a large army (such as scouting parties), but it was common to see them employed in such a way even as part of a major force.

==Historical use==
Romans first encountered that tactic in the Lusitanian War in which Lusitanians used the tactic called &quot;concursare&quot; (&quot;bustling&quot;). It involved charging forwards against the enemy lines, only to retreat after a brief clash or without clashing, which would be followed by more attacks in a similar cadence. The Lusitanians drove the Roman armies to break formation and chase them, leading them to traps and ambushes.

The Seljuk victory over the Byzantine Empire at the Battle of Manzikert was preceded by hit-and-run attacks of Seljuk cavalry, which threw the Byzantine army into confusion and proved fatal once it started to retreat. Similarly, the earlier Parthian and Sassanid Persian horse archers paved the way for their cataphracts&#x27; attack, which achieved the decisive victories at the Battle of Carrhae and Battle of Edessa. The use of hit-and-run tactics dates back even earlier to the nomadic Scythians of Central Asia, who used them against Darius the Great&#x27;s Persian Achaemenid Empire and later against Alexander the Great&#x27;s Macedonian Empire. The Turkish general Baibars also successfully used hit-and-run during the Battle of Ain Jalut, the first defeat of the quickly expanding Mongol Empire. Vastly outnumbered in North America, the French made effective use of hit-and-run raids during the various French and Indian Wars. In the Turkish War of Independence, the Turks fought against the Greeks by hit-and-run tactics before a regular army was set up.
Marathas under shivaji and his successors also resorted to hit and run tactics against Mughal Empire.

During the Vietnam War, Viet Cong forces used hit-and-run tactics to great effectiveness against U.S. military forces. The tactic was also used in Afghanistan by rebel forces during the Soviet–Afghan War. Various Iraqi insurgent groups have also used hit-and-run tactics against Iraqi Security Forces and American-led coalition forces in Iraq. Improvised fighting vehicles, called &quot;technicals&quot;, are often used in such operations.

== In economics==
The term &quot;hit-and-run&quot; is also used in economics to describe a firm that enters a market to take advantage of abnormal profits and then leave. These tactics can be seen in a contestable market.

<doc id="241983" wikidata="Q7674066" url="?curid=241983" title="Tactical (album)">
<text>Tactical is the debut studio album by American melodic death metal band World Under Blood. Recorded at HIV + Cocksplitter and Keene Machine Studios in Los Angeles, California with Logan Mader and Michael Keene, it was produced by the band&#x27;s frontman Deron Miller and guest musician James Murphy. The album was released on July 26, 2011, by Nuclear Blast Records.

The material for &quot;Tactical&quot; was written by Miller and arranged with drummer Tim Yeung, with the exception of the two cover versions: Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot; and Malevolent Creation&#x27;s &quot;Alliance or War&quot;. Murphy mixed and mastered the album. &quot;Tactical&quot; reached number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, selling around 900 copies in its first week.

==Recording and production==
Deron Miller (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Tim Yeung (drums, keyboards) first began performing together as World Under Blood in October 2006, recording three demo tracks with engineer Logan Mader in Los Angeles, California. The demo recordings, for the songs &quot;Under the Autumn Low&quot;, &quot;God Among the Waste&quot;, and &quot;Dead and Still in Pain&quot;, were eventually released between November 2006 and September 2007.

Recording for &quot;Tactical&quot; took place at Mader&#x27;s HIV + Cocksplitter Studios and second engineer Michael Keene&#x27;s Keene Machine Studios in Los Angeles. Death guitarist James Murphy joined the group as a guest musician, performing guitar solos, bass and keyboards on numerous songs on the album, which he also mixed and mastered.

==Release and reception==
Recording for the album was completed by March 2010, but due to Miller&#x27;s return to working with CKY its release was pushed back from July 2010 to July 2011. Although no singles were released from &quot;Tactical&quot;, a music video (directed by Shan Dan Horan) was produced for the song &quot;Into the Arms of Cruelty&quot;. Upon its release, &quot;Tactical&quot; reached number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, selling approximately 900 copies in the week of release.

==Composition==
Lyrically, &quot;Tactical&quot; deals with a number of complex personal and philosophical concepts, which Miller detailed in a track-by-track feature prior to the album&#x27;s release. Within the feature, the band&#x27;s frontman proclaimed that he was &quot;obsessed with mental illness&quot;, and noted that at least three tracks on the album featured lyrical references to various mental conditions – &quot;Pyro-Compulsive&quot; is based on &quot;the idea of someone lusting over lighting their house on fire while they&#x27;re inside&quot;; &quot;Dead and Still in Pain&quot; is written about depression and anxiety, in particular &quot;not knowing what to do with yourself or where to turn&quot;; and &quot;Under the Autumn Low&quot; references seasonal affective disorder, from which Miller claims he suffers on a regular basis.

&quot;Into the Arms of Cruelty&quot;, which Miller has claimed is one of his favourite songs on the album, is described as the vocalist&#x27;s &quot;unrestrained opinion&quot; on child abuse, which he says makes him &quot;fucking sick&quot;. A number of tracks also deal with viewpoints on political issues – opening track &quot;A God Among the Waste&quot;, for example, is described as a song about &quot;finding a legitimate political leader, and finally cleaning up the U.S.&quot;, while the lyrics of &quot;Purgatory Dormitory&quot; discuss the idea of using torture as a punishment for criminals, with Miller theorising about &quot;numbing every nerve in a criminal’s body, blinding and deafening them, and leaving them with just their brain ... to think and to suffer&quot;.

Organized religion is another subject discussed on &quot;Tactical&quot;, in particular on the track &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand His Name&quot;, which is aimed at no particular faith or religious practice in particular but instead concerns the general power and style of organized religion, including preaching. The final original track on the album, &quot;Revere&#x27;s Tears&quot;, is based on the story of George Revere, who is described by Miller as &quot;a genius doctor&quot; who allegedly discovered a cure for cancer before being murdered; the song is essentially written about the conspiracy theory that &quot;if you do discover a cure for cancer, you will either be privately bought out, or killed&quot;, with the singer making reference to other diseases such as HIV/AIDS and diabetes.
