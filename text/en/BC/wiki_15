<text>The Junkers Ju 52/3m (nicknamed &quot;Tante Ju&quot; (&quot;Aunt Ju&quot;) and &quot;Iron Annie&quot;) is a transport aircraft that was designed and manufactured by German aviation company Junkers. First introduced during 1930 as a civilian airliner, it was adapted into a military transport aircraft by Germany&#x27;s Nazi regime, who exercised power over the company for its war efforts, over the objections of the company&#x27;s founder Hugo Junkers.

Development of the Ju 52 commenced in the late 1920s, headed by German aeronautical engineer Ernst Zindel. The aircraft&#x27;s design incorporated a duralumin metal skin as a strengthening measure, which was a material design pioneered by Junkers and used on many of their aircraft, including the popular Junkers F 13 1920s, the record-setting Junkers W 33, and Junkers W34. The corrugation was both a strength and a weakness; it provided increased structural strength but also increased aerodynamic drag. But more importantly it allowed the practical use of aluminum before newer alloys were developed.

The Ju 52&#x27;s maiden flight was performed on 13 October 1930. It was initially designed with a single-engine version and a trimotor version; the single-engine version was to be the freighter while the trimotor was the passenger airline. In the long run, the trimotor configuration was produced in far greater numbers. The primary early production model, the &quot;Ju 52/3m&quot;, was principally operated as a 17-seat airliner or utility transport aircraft by various civil operators during the 1930s. Starting in 1933, the Nazi regime that had taken power in Germany demanded that Junkers produce military versions of the Ju 52. Despite Hugo Junkers&#x27; resistance, the company was compelled to produce military aircraft; in 1935, Nazi officials visited Hugo Junkers&#x27; house on his birthday, resulting in his death under unclear circumstances and his company having been signed over to the state. Thousands of Ju 52s were procured as a staple military transport of the Luftwaffe. The &quot;Ju 52/3mg7e&quot; was the principal production model.

The Ju 52 was in production between 1931 and 1952. In a civilian role, it flew with over 12 airlines, including Swissair and Deutsche Luft Hansa, as both a passenger carrier and a freight hauler. In a military role, large numbers flew with the Luftwaffe, being deployed on virtually all fronts of the Second World War as a troop and cargo transport; it was also briefly used as a medium bomber. Additionally, the type was deployed by other nations&#x27; militaries in conflicts such as the Spanish Civil War, the Chaco War, the First Indochina War, and the Portuguese Colonial War. During the postwar era, the Ju 52 had a lengthy service life with numerous military and civilian operators; large numbers were still in use by the 1980s. Even in the 21st century, several aircraft have remained operational, typically used for heritage aviation displays and aerial sightseeing.

==Development==
===Origins===
The Ju 52 was designed starting in 1925, in two versions, a single engine version for freight transport (Ju-52/1m) and trimotor passenger version for 17 (Ju 52/3m), both as civilian versions. Both designs were overseen by the German aeronautical engineer Earnst Zindel, the design team being based at the Junkers works at Dessau. A driving force in the project was the commercial prospects presented by the German airline Deutsch Lufthansa. Work on turning the design into a prototype started in 1928. The Ju 52 had numerous similarities to several previous Junkers aircraft, such as the previous Junkers W 33, noted for its crossing of the Atlantic in 1928, and the smaller Junkers W 34. Sharing features included the distinctive corrugated duraluminum exterior. According to aviation author J. Richard Smith, the Ju 52 directly drew upon the company&#x27;s First World War-era Junkers J 1 - the world&#x27;s first all-metal aeroplane.

On 13 October 1930, the first prototype, designated &quot;Ju 52ba&quot;, performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight; it was initially powered by a single Junkers-built liquid-cooled V-12 engine, capable of generating up to . During the aircraft&#x27;s extensive trials, it was reengined with a BMW IV water-cooled inline-6 powerplant. The second prototype, designated &quot;Ju 52de&quot;, featured an increased wing span and was powered by the BMW IV engine at first; it was soon reengined with the 14-cylinder twin-row air-cooled radial Armstrong Siddeley Leopard and re-designated &quot;Ju 52di&quot;. Later on, the Ju 52di was again reengined with the Junkers Jumo 204 air-cooled inverted inline-6, after which it was re-designated &quot;Ju 52do&quot;. The third prototype, designated &quot;Ju 52ce&quot;, had a strengthened structure, a modified leading edge, and was fitted with both a wheeled and float undercarriages.

During May 1931, one of the prototypes, designated &quot;Ju 52cai&quot;, was written off after a crash. While these initial aircraft had been powered by a single engine, Junkers decided to develop the Ju 52 into a trimotor configuration. Accordingly, the &quot;Ju 52/3m&quot; (&quot;drei motoren&quot;—&quot;three engines&quot;) was developed, being powered by an arrangement of three radial engines. According to Smith, the earliest known Ju 52/3m was delivered to Bolivian airline Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano during 1932. During its initial production years, airlines were the type&#x27;s most common customers. By the mid-1930s, the &quot;Ju 52/3mce&quot; and &quot;Ju 52/3fe&quot;, were the two primary production variants, both being powered by the BMW 132 radial engine.

=== Militarized versions ===
Shortly after the Nazis came into power in 1933, Junkers was approached to participate in Germany&#x27;s rearmament. When Junkers declined, the Nazis responded by demanding ownership of all patents and market shares from his remaining companies, under threat of imprisonment on the grounds of High Treason. Despite Hugo Junkers&#x27; objections, his company, designs, and name would be pressed into military service to serve the militaristic regime that had gained power in Germany. Ironically, despite his designs being associated with Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe and the Second World War, Hugo Junkers had opposed Nazism. 
During 1934, work commenced on a militarised model of the Ju 52/3m, designated &quot;Ju 52/3mg3e&quot;, on behalf of the then-secret Luftwaffe. This model could function as a medium bomber, being furnished with a pair of machine gun positions (an open dorsal position and a ventral &quot;dustbin&quot; position lowered by a hand crank), each with single machine guns and operated by a crew of four. Between 1934 and 1935, a total of 450 Ju 52/3mg3e aircraft were delivered to the Luftwaffe.

===Wartime and postwar===
Numerous improved models would be introduced prior to and during the Second World War. The dominant production model was the &quot;Ju 52/3mg7e&quot;, featuring advances such as an autopilot, enlarged doors to the cabin, and other general enhancements. It was configured as a pure transport aircraft, being capable of carrying up to 18 fully-equipped troops. Defensive armaments comprised a dorsal-mounted 13 mm MG 131 machine gun and a pair of beam 7.9mm MG 15 machine guns. Successive models saw other improvements, such as revised glazing, newer engines, undercarriage strengthening, and increased take-off weight. The final wartime model to be developed, designated &quot;Ju 52/3mg14e&quot;, featured improved armour protection for the pilot and a bolstered defensive armament.

From mid-1943 onwards, the Luftwaffe began to make less use of the Ju 52, interest having waned in the type. German officials were interested in procuring a successor to the type; at one stage, the Reich Air Ministry showed enthusiasm for the Junkers Ju 352, a larger transport aircraft somewhat resembling the Ju 52. Actions were taken to convert Junkers&#x27; Ju 52 production lines to instead manufacture Ju 352s; however, the conflict&#x27;s end in May 1945 led to the effort being abandoned in an unfinished state. As such, German production of the Ju 52 was terminated during 1944; Smith claims that a total of 3,234 aircraft of various models were constructed during the conflict.

In the postwar era, manufacture of the Ju 52 resumed, albeit in foreign countries. It was constructed in France by Avions Amiot as the &quot;Amiot AAC.1 Toucan&quot;; it was also produced in Spain by Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) as the &quot;CASA 352&quot;. A handful of captured wartime aircraft were also rebuilt by Short Brothers of Northern Ireland for civilian service.

==Design==
The Ju 52 had a low cantilever wing, the midsection of which was built into the fuselage, forming its underside. It was formed around four pairs of circular cross-section duralumin spars with a corrugated surface that provided torsional stiffening. A narrow control surface, with its outer section functioning as the aileron, and the inner section functioning as a flap, ran along the whole trailing edge of each wing panel, well separated from it. The inner flap section lowered the stalling speed and the arrangement became known as the &quot;Doppelflügel&quot;, or &quot;double wing&quot;. The outer sections of this operated differentially as ailerons, projecting slightly beyond the wingtips with control horns. The strutted horizontal stabilizer carried horn-balanced elevators which again projected and showed a significant gap between them and the stabilizer, which was adjustable in-flight. All stabilizer surfaces were corrugated.

The Ju 52 featured an unusual corrugated duralumin metal skin, which had been pioneered by Junkers during the First World War; the corrugation served to strengthen the whole structure over a smoother approach. The fuselage was of rectangular section with a domed decking, comprising a tubular steel structure that was entirely covered by the corrugated metal skin. A port-side passenger door was placed just aft of the wings; this entrance also acted as a loading hatch for freight, the lower half functioning as a platform to ease cargo movements. The cabin had a dimensional capacity of , and was lined with numerous windows stretching forward to the pilots&#x27; cockpit. The main undercarriage was fixed and divided; some aircraft had wheel fairings, others did not. A fixed tailskid, or a later tailwheel, was used. Some aircraft were fitted with floats or skis instead of the main wheels.

In its original configuration, designated the &quot;Ju 52/1m&quot;, the Ju 52 was a single-engined aircraft, powered by either a BMW IV or Junkers liquid-cooled V-12 engine. However, the single-engined model was deemed to have been underpowered and, after seven prototypes had been completed, all subsequent Ju 52s were built with three radial engines as the &quot;Ju 52/3m&quot; (&quot;drei motoren&quot;—&quot;three engines&quot;). Originally powered by three Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, later production models mainly received 574 kW (770 hp) BMW 132 engines, a licence-built refinement of the Pratt &amp; Whitney design. Export models were also built with 447 kW (600 hp) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp and 578 kW (775 hp) Bristol Pegasus VI engines.

The two wing-mounted radial engines of the Ju 52/3m had half-chord cowlings and in planform view (from above/below) appeared to be splayed outwards, being mounted at an almost perpendicular angle to the tapered wing&#x27;s sweptback leading edge (in a similar fashion to the Mitsubishi G3M bomber and Short Sunderland; the angled engines on the Ju 52 were intended to make maintaining straight flight easier should an engine fail, while the others had different reasons). The three engines had either Townend ring or NACA cowlings to reduce drag from the engine cylinders, although a mixture of the two was most common (as can be seen in many of the accompanying photographs), with deeper-chord NACA cowlings on the wing engines and a narrow Townend ring on the center engine (onto which a deeper NACA cowl was more difficult to fit, due to the widening fuselage behind the engine). Production Ju 52/3m aircraft flown by Deutsche Luft Hansa before the Second World War, as well as Luftwaffe-flown Ju 52s flown during the war, usually used an air-start system to turn over their trio of radial engines, using a common compressed air supply that also operated the main wheels&#x27; brakes.

In a military context, the Ju 52 could carry up to 18 fully-equipped soldiers, or 12 stretchers when used as an air ambulance. Transported material was loaded and unloaded through side doors by means of a ramp. Air-dropped supplies were jettisoned through two double chutes; supply containers were dropped by parachute through the bomb-bay doors, and paratroopers jumped through the side doors. Sd.Kfz. 2 &quot;Kettenkrafträder&quot; (half-track motorcycles) and supply canisters for parachute troops were secured under the fuselage at the bomb bay exits and were dropped with four parachutes. A tow coupling was built into the tail-skid for use in towing freight gliders. The Ju 52 could tow up to two DFS 230 gliders.

==Operational history==



===Prewar civil use===
In late 1931, James A. Richardson&#x27;s Canadian Airways received (Werknummer 4006) &quot;CF-ARM&quot;, the sixth-built Ju 52/1m. The aircraft, first refitted with an Armstrong Siddeley Leopard radial engine and then later with a Rolls-Royce Buzzard and nicknamed the &quot;Flying Boxcar&quot; in Canada, could carry and had a maximum weight of . It was commonly used to supply mining and other operations in remote areas with equipment that was too big and heavy for other aircraft then in use. The Ju 52/1m was able to land on wheels, skis, or floats (as were all Ju 52 variants).

Prior to the Nazi government&#x27;s seizure of control of the Junkers company during 1935, the Ju 52/3m was produced principally as a 17-seat airliner. By 1935, 97 Ju 52s were being operated by numerous airlines; early customers included Finland&#x27;s Aero O/Y, Sweden&#x27;s AB Aerotransport, and Brazil&#x27;s Syndicato Condor.

During May 1932, German flag carrier Luft Hansa took delivery of its first example of the type. The Ju 52 was heavily used by Luft Hansa, it was able to fly from Berlin to Rome in eight hours; both this route and the London-Berlin service was frequently operated by the type. According to Smith, Luft Hansa&#x27;s Ju 52 fleet eventually numbered 231 Ju 52s; during the pre-war era, it was flown on various routes from Germany on routes in Europe, Asia, and South America.

===Military use 1932–1945===
The Colombian Air Force used three Ju 52/3mde bombers equipped as floatplanes during the Colombia-Peru War in 1932–1933. After the war, the air force acquired three other Ju 52mge as transports; the type remained in service until after the end of the Second World War.

Bolivia acquired four Ju 52s in the course of the Chaco War (1932–1935), mainly for medical evacuation and air supply. During the conflict, the Ju 52s alone transported more than 4,400 tons of cargo to the front.

In 1934, Junkers received orders to produce a bomber version of the Ju 52/3m to serve as interim equipment for the bomber units of the still-secret Luftwaffe until it could be replaced by the purpose-designed Dornier Do 11. Two bomb bays were fitted, capable of holding up to of bombs, while defensive armament consisted of two 7.92 mm MG 15 machine guns, one in an open dorsal position, and one in a retractable &quot;dustbin&quot; ventral position, which could be manually winched down from the fuselage to protect the aircraft from attacks from below. The bomber could be easily converted to serve in the transport role. The Dornier Do 11 was a failure, however, and the Junkers ended up being acquired in much larger numbers than at first expected, with the type being the Luftwaffe&#x27;s main bomber until more modern aircraft such as the Heinkel He 111, Junkers Ju 86 and Dornier Do 17 entered into service.

The Ju 52 was used in military service in the Spanish Civil War against the Spanish Republic. It was one of the first aircraft to be delivered to the Nationalist faction in July 1936, with 20 Ju 52/3m g3e bombers being delivered to the Nationalist forces by Germany within a week of the start of the war. Their first use was to help airlift Franco&#x27;s Army of Africa from Morocco to the Spanish mainland, bypassing a Spanish republican naval blockade. Between 20 July and the end of August 1936, Ju 52s carried out 461 transport flights, ferrying 7,350 troops together with weapons and equipment, with 5,455 more troops carried in September and a further 1,157 troops carried by the time the airlift ended early in October. According to Smith, the Ju 52 gained a formidable reputation; the type having been reportedly used in practically every major military engagement in support of Nationalist forces. In the Spanish theatre, the Ju 52 was operated both as a bomber and as a transport. In the former role, it participated in the bombing of Guernica, although it was considered obsolete as a bomber by late 1937, by which point it was in the process of being replaced by more capable bombers such as the Dornier Do 17 and Heinkel He 111. The type&#x27;s final sortie in the theatre was performed on 26 March 1939. By the end of the conflict, Ju 52s had accumulated 13,000 operational hours and had performed 5,400 offensive missions and dropped over 6,000 bombs.

Following the end of the Spanish Civil War, no further aircraft of the bomber variants were built, though the type was again used as a bomber during the bombing of Warsaw during the invasion of Poland in September 1939. The Luftwaffe instead relied on the Ju 52 for transport roles during the Second World War, including paratroop drops.

===Second World War===
During its service with Luft Hansa, the Ju 52 had proved to be an extremely reliable passenger airplane. This positive experience contributed to its adoption by the Luftwaffe as a standard aircraft model. In 1938, the 7th Air Division had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of the Second World War. Though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until around the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, 100 to 200 were still available.

Lightly armed, and with a top speed of only 265 km/h (165 mph) — half that of a contemporary Hurricane — the Ju 52 was very vulnerable to fighter attack, and an escort was always necessary when flying in a combat zone. Many Ju 52&#x27;s were shot down by antiaircraft guns and fighters while transporting supplies, most notably during the desperate attempt to resupply the trapped German Sixth Army during the final stages of the Battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942–1943.

From 24 November 1942 to 31 January 1943, 488 aircraft were recorded as lost (this number included 266 Ju 52, 165 He 111, 42 Ju 86, 9 Fw 200, 5 He 177 and 1 Ju 290) and about 1,000 flight personnel.

====Denmark and Norway campaign====

The first major operation for the aircraft after the bombing of Warsaw was at the start of Operation Weserübung, the attack on Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940. 52 Ju 52s from 1. and 8. Staffel in Kampfgeschwader 1 transported a company of &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratroopers) and a battalion of infantry to Aalborg in northern Jutland. These troops captured the airfield there, vital to support later operations in southern Norway. Several hundred Ju 52s were also used to transport troops to Norway in the first days of that campaign.

During the Norwegian campaign, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Ju 52s performed a total of 3,018 sorties, 1,830 of which carried troops while the remainder transported cargo and various supplies. According to Smith, 29,280 personnel, 2,376 tons of supplies and 259,300 imp. gallons of fuel were airlifted by Ju 52s through the campaign. Around 150 aircraft were recorded as lost by the end of operations.

The seaplane version, equipped with two large floats, served during the Norwegian campaign in 1940, and later in the Mediterranean theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theatre.

Some Ju 52&#x27;s, both floatplanes and land planes, were used as minesweepers, known as &quot;Minensuch&quot; — literally, &quot;mine-search&quot; aircraft in German. These aircraft were fitted with a diameter current-carrying degaussing ring under the airframe to create a magnetic field that triggered submerged naval mines. They were usually designated by an -&quot;MS&quot; suffix, like similarly equipped Bv 138 MS trimotor flying boats.

====Netherlands campaign====
The Ju 52 transport aircraft participated in the attack on the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. It was during this campaign that the Ju 52 performed a crucial role in carrying out the first large-scale air attack with paratroops in history during the Battle for The Hague. According to Smith, 500 Ju 52s had been made ready for the aerial assault on the Low Countries. In addition to the paratroop drops, they also directly landed in hostile territory to deploy assault troops, such as at Ypenburg Airport, on public highways around The Hague, and on the River Meuse (the latter using float-equipped aircraft).

During the opening days of the Netherlands campaign, many German aircraft were shot down by Dutch AA-fire; a total of 125 Ju 52s were lost and 47 damaged; author Hooton considered these losses to have been relatively costly for the Luftwaffe. Although transport operations with the Ju 52 were noticeably curtailed after the initial days of the invasion, the type continued to aerially supply forward ground troops.

During August 1940, Nazi German decided to base large numbers of Ju 52s at airfields in the Lyon, Lille, and Arras areas. Luftwaffe transport units were deliberately held at a state of readiness for Operation Sea Lion, the envisioned invasion of the British Isles; however, this operation was never attempted, in part due to the Luftwaffe being unable to secure aerial supremacy during the Battle of Britain.

====Balkans campaign====
The next major use of the Ju 52 was in the Balkans campaign. The type has been credited with enabling the rapid deployment of German ground forces throughout the theatre. The Ju 52 was also deployed during the Battle of Crete in late May 1941. 493 Ju 52/3m aircraft were used to transport most of the 22,750 troops flown onto Crete for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s largest airborne invasion of the war. While victorious, 170 aircraft were lost along with 4,500 personnel; the high loss rate brought about the end of German paratrooper operations.

====North Africa campaign====

During the North African campaign, the Ju 52 was the mainstay reinforcement and resupply transport for the Germans, starting with 20 to 50 flights a day to Tunisia from Sicily in November 1942, building to 150 landings a day in early April as the Axis situation became more desperate. The Allied air forces developed a counter-air operation over a two-month period and implemented Operation Flax on 5 April 1943, destroying 11 Ju 52s in the air near Cap Bon and many more during bombing attacks on its Sicilian airfields, leaving only 29 flyable. That began two catastrophic weeks in which more than 140 aircraft were lost in air interceptions, culminating on 18 April with the &quot;Palm Sunday Massacre&quot; in which 24 Ju 52s were shot down, and another 35 staggered back to Sicily and crash-landed.

===Hitler&#x27;s personal transport===
Hitler used a Deutsche Luft Hansa Ju 52 for campaigning in the 1932 German election, preferring flying to train travel. After he became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Hans Baur became his personal pilot, and Hitler was provided with a personal Ju 52. Named &quot;Immelmann II&quot; after the First World War ace Max Immelmann, it carried the registration D-2600. As his power and importance grew, Hitler&#x27;s personal air force grew to nearly 50 aircraft, based at Berlin Tempelhof Airport and made up mainly of Ju 52s, which also flew other members of his cabinet and war staff. In September 1939, at Baur&#x27;s suggestion, &quot;Immelmann II&quot; was replaced by a four-engine Focke-Wulf Fw 200 &quot;Condor&quot;, although &quot;Immelman II&quot; remained his backup aircraft for the rest of the Second World War.

===Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s personal transport===

Eurasia was a major Chinese airliner company in the 1930s and operated at least seven Ju 52/3ms. A further example, sent out as a demonstrator to Eurasia, was purchased by the Chinese Nationalist Party government and became Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s personal transport.

===Postwar use===

Various Junkers Ju 52s continued in military and civilian use following World War II. In 1956, the Portuguese Air Force, which was already using the Ju 52s as a transport plane, employed the type as a paratroop drop aircraft for its newly organized elite parachute forces, later known as the &quot;Batalhão de Caçadores Páraquedistas&quot;. The paratroopers used the Ju 52 in several combat operations in Angola and other Portuguese African colonies before gradually phasing it out of service in the 1960s.

The Swiss Air Force also operated the Ju 52 from 1939 to 1982, when three aircraft remained in operation, probably the last and longest service in any air force. Museums hoped to obtain the aircraft, but they were not for sale. They are still in flying condition and together with a CASA 352 can be booked for sightseeing tours with Ju-Air.
During the 1950s, the Ju 52 was also used by the French Air Force during the First Indochina War as a bomber. The use of these Junkers was quite limited.

The Spanish Air Force operated the Ju 52, nicknamed &quot;Pava&quot;, until well into the 1970s. Escuadrón 721, flying the Spanish-built versions, was employed in training parachutists from Alcantarilla Air Base near Murcia.

Some military Ju 52s were converted to civilian use. For example, British European Airways operated 11 ex-Luftwaffe Ju 52/3mg8e machines, taken over by the RAF, between 1946 and retirement in 1947 on intra-U.K. routes before the Douglas DC-3 was introduced to the airline. French airlines such as &quot;Societe de Transports Aeriens&quot; (STA) and Air France flew Toucans in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

In the USSR, captured Ju 52s were allocated to the Civil Air Fleet, being found particularly suitable for transporting sulphur from the Karakum Desert. Various Soviet agencies used the Ju 52 through to 1950.

In Yugoslavia the Ju-52 was in use by Yugoslav Air Force, which also heavily financed flying clubs such as Letalski center Maribor and supported many parachuting sports activities with them. Yugoslav plane number 208 dropped paratroopers for the last time in 1960 at Maribor Airport and today is preserved in the Aeronautical Museum Belgrade.

A Ju 52 and a Douglas DC-3 were the last aircraft to take off from Berlin Tempelhof Airport before all operations ceased there on 30 October 2008.

===Other versions===

Most Ju 52s were destroyed after the war, but 585 were built after 1945. In France, the machine had been manufactured during the war by the Junkers-controlled Avions Amiot company, and production continued afterwards as the Amiot AAC 1 Toucan. In Spain, &quot;Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA&quot; continued production as the CASA 352 and 352L. Four CASA 352s are airworthy and in regular use today.

===New Generation===
In April 2022, 90 years after the first flight of the Ju 52/3m, the Swiss Junkers Flugzeugwerke AG announced the successor model of the Ju 52, the Ju 52 New Generation. The Ju 52 New Generation will be able to carry 14 passengers and will have modern RED A03 engines and modern avionics. The market launch is not expected before 2025.

<text>Yarm-on-Tees, or simply Yarm, is a market town in North Yorkshire, England. It lies on a meander of the River Tees, extending south-east to the River Leven and south to the village of Kirklevington. A civil parish in the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, Yarm is near the towns of Stockton-on-Tees, to its northeast, and Darlington, to its west.

Yarm is known for its high street, voted Britain&#x27;s best in a 2007 BBC Breakfast poll, and the Yarm Viaduct which spans across the town. It is also known locally for its annual funfair.

==History==
The name &quot;Yarm&quot; is thought to be derived from the Old English &quot;gearum&quot;, dative plural of &quot;gear,&quot; &#x27;pool for catching fish&#x27; (source of the modern dialect word &quot;yair&quot; with the same meaning), hence &#x27;at the place of the fish pools&#x27;. Yarm was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, and was originally a chapelry in the Kirklevington parish in the North Riding of Yorkshire; it later became a parish in its own right.

The Yarm helmet is a Viking Age helmet that was found in Yarm. It is the first relatively complete Anglo-Scandinavian helmet found in Britain and only the second Viking helmet discovered in north-west Europe. It is displayed nearby in Preston Park Museum, Preston-on-Tees.

Dominican Friars settled in Yarm about 1286, and maintained a friary and a hospital in the town, until 1583. Their memory is preserved in the names of Friarage and Spital Bank. The Friarage was built on top of the cellars of a Dominican friary in 1770, for the Meynell family. It is now at the centre of Yarm School.

Bishop Skirlaw of Durham built a stone bridge, which still stands, across the Tees in 1400. An iron replacement was built in 1805, but it fell down in 1806. For many years, Yarm was at the tidal limit and head of navigation on the River Tees.

On 1 February 1643, during the First English Civil War, a small Roundhead force attempted to halt the progress of a large waggon-train of arms, landed at Tynemouth and destined to bolster the Royalist war effort in Yorkshire and beyond. Heavily outnumbered and outflanked by Royalist ford crossings, the Parliamentarians were quickly routed and the Royalists gained the bridge, crossing into Yorkshire.

On 12 February 1821, at the &quot;George &amp; Dragon Inn&quot;, the meeting was held that pressed for the third and successful attempt for a Bill to give permission to build the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway, the world&#x27;s first public railway.

In 1890, Bulmer &amp; Co listed twelve inns in Yarm: Black Bull, Cross Keys, Crown Inn, Fleece, George and Dragon, Green Tree, Ketton Ox, Lord Nelson, Red Lion, Three Tuns, Tom Brown, and Union. Also listed was Cross Keys beside the Leven Bridge.

In the 13th century, Yarm was classed as a borough, but this status did not persist. It formed part of the Stokesley Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894, and remained so until 1 April 1974 when, under the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the district of Stockton-on-Tees in the new non-metropolitan county of Cleveland. Cleveland was abolished in 1996 under the Banham Review, with Stockton-on-Tees becoming a unitary authority.

In January 2025, the Town Hall clock-winder, 76-year-old Graham Tebbs, retired after 32 years of manual clock-winding. The clock mechanism was now wound electrically.

==Geography==

Yarm is bordered by two rivers, the River Tees to the north, and the River Leven to the east. The Leven is a tributary of the Tees. Yarm was once the highest port on the Tees.

Two road bridges cross the river, Yarm Bridge crossing from the High Street to Eaglescliffe, which is Grade II* listed, and Leven Bridge crossing the Leven between Yarm and Low Leven, which is Grade II listed. On 26 February 2010, Leven Bridge was closed after cracks appeared in it. Repairs took less time than expected, and the bridge re-opened on 18 June 2010.

Yarm Town Hall in the High Street was built in 1710 by Thomas Belasyse, 3rd Viscount Fauconberg who was Lord of the Manor. In a poll taken for the BBC&#x27;s Breakfast programme on 19 January 2007, Yarm&#x27;s High Street was voted the &#x27;Best High Street&#x27;: the street and its cobbled parking areas is fronted by many Georgian-style old buildings, with their red pantile roofs.

The A67, which runs through High Street was previously classified as the A19 until a dual carriageway was built in the 1970s, about south of the town near the village of Crathorne. When the A19 ran through High Street, it was heavily congested. The road was used by heavy goods traffic as a shortcut to Teesside International Airport. The classification of the road as an &#x27;A&#x27;-road meant that it was difficult to place a ban on heavy goods vehicles; however the town council made efforts to come up with voluntary agreements with many haulage firms until 2012, when all HGV traffic was banned from the route through Yarm and Eaglescliffe.

The Rookery is a public area by the River Tees situated at the bottom of Goose Pasture. The ash, sycamore and lime woodland is about 200 years old and owned by Yarm Town Council. In 2002, a walkway was constructed around the wood to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Within the woodland, close to the river, BMX riders have created numerous dirt ramps which are regularly used during summer months.

Areas of Yarm include the housing estates Levendale in the southeast and Leven Park in the south.

<text>A whip is an official of a political party whose task is to ensure party discipline (that members of the party vote according to the party platform rather than their individual beliefs or that of donors or constituents) in a legislature. 

Whips are the party&#x27;s &quot;enforcers&quot;. They work to ensure that their fellow political party legislators attend voting sessions and vote according to their party&#x27;s official policy. Members who vote against party policy may &quot;lose the whip&quot;, being expelled from the party. 

The term is said to be taken from the &quot;&quot; during a hunt, who tries to prevent hounds from wandering away from a hunting pack. The term may more reasonably have been taken from the practice of &quot;keeping discipline&quot; in slaves by cracking a leather whip over their heads.

Additionally, the term &quot;whip&quot; may mean the voting instructions issued to legislators, or the status of a certain legislator in their party&#x27;s parliamentary grouping.

==Etymology==
The expression &quot;whip&quot; in its parliamentary context, derived from its origins in hunting terminology. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines the term &quot;whipper-in&quot; as, &quot;a huntsman&#x27;s assistant who keeps the hounds from straying by driving them back with the whip into the main body of the pack&quot;. According to that dictionary, the first recorded use of the term &quot;whipper-in&quot; in the parliamentary sense occurs in 1772. However, P.D.G. Thomas in &quot;House of Commons in the Eighteenth Century&quot; cites two examples of the use of the term that pre-date 1772.

==In countries using the Westminster system==

===Australia===
In the Parliament of Australia, as well as in the parliaments of the six states and two self-governing territories, major political parties have whips to ensure party discipline and carry out a variety of other functions on behalf of the party leadership. The most important function of the whip&#x27;s office is to ensure that all members and senators are present to take part in votes in the chamber (maintaining quorum and preventing censure motions). Unlike in the United Kingdom, Australian whips do not hold official office, but they are recognised for parliamentary purposes. In practice, Australian whips play a lesser role than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, as party discipline in Australia tends to be tighter.

Their roles in the chamber include taking divisions, and maintaining a &quot;pairs book&quot; which controls the ability of members and senators to leave the parliament building during sittings, as well as the entitlement to be absent during divisions.

Liberal Party whips are appointed by the leader of the party, while Australian Labor Party whips are elected by the Caucus. For Labor and the Liberals, the chief whip is assisted by two deputy whips.

===Canada===
In Canada the Party Whip is the member of a political party in the Canadian House of Commons, the Canadian Senate or a provincial legislature charged with ensuring party discipline among members of the caucus. In the House of Commons, the whip&#x27;s office prepares and distributes vote sheets identifying the party position on each bill or motion. The whip is also responsible for assigning offices and scheduling speakers from his or her party for various bills, motions and other proceedings in the House.
===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the concept of the whip was inherited from colonial British rule. Chief Whip is a member of the parliament of Bangladesh from the ruling party who is responsible for the maintenance of party discipline inside the parliament.

The work of the whip is to ensure the proper participation (as the party wants) of the party MPs in the activities of the parliament, such as voting, If the leader and deputy leader of parliament are absent, the whip can speak for them.

===India===
In India, Every major political party appoints a whip who is responsible for the party&#x27;s discipline and behaviours on the floor of the house. Usually, they direct the party members to stick to the party&#x27;s stand on certain issues and directs them to vote as per the direction of senior party members. However, there are some cases such as Indian Presidential elections where whips cannot direct a Member of Parliament (MP) or Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) on whom to vote. Should a whip&#x27;s order be violated by a member of the same party, then the whip can recommend immediate dismissal of that member from the house due to indiscipline and the Speaker of the respective house can decide on the matter (without time limit). Should the whip choose not follow up on the violation his/her official whip order by own party member due to any reason, then any member of house can do so to the Speaker. 

===Ireland===
Whips exist for all parliamentary parties in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The government chief whip is normally a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, and attends cabinet meetings. The whips of each house meet weekly to set the agenda for the next week&#x27;s business. The Technical Group in the Dáil and the analogous Independent groups in the Seanad nominate whips to attend these meetings even though there is no party line for their whips to enforce. Whips also coordinate pairing.

The timing of most votes are difficult to predict and TDs are expected to stay within earshot of the division bell at all times. All TDs are expected to vote with their party and to receive permission if they intend to be absent for a vote. Free votes are not a common feature of the Irish parliamentary tradition but they do happen on occasion, and there are calls for them to happen more often. For instance, Fianna Fáil usually allowed a free vote on abortion bills, as in the Protection of Human Life In Pregnancy Act.

From 1998, whips and assistant whips may be entitled to an allowance on top of their base legislator&#x27;s salary. In 2011, these allowances varied proportional to the size of the group, with Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Dáil whip&#x27;s allowance the highest at €19,000.

===Malaysia===
Party whips in Malaysia serve a similar role as in other Westminster system-based parliamentary democracies. However, party discipline tends to be tighter in Malaysia and therefore the role of the whip is generally less important, though its importance is heightened when the government majority is less in the lower house.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, the concept of the whip was inherited from British rule. All political parties that have four or more members in Parliament have at least one party whip, although Green Party whips are called &quot;musterers&quot;. Parties with 25 to 44 members are allowed two whips (one senior and one junior), and parties with 45 or more members are entitled to three whips (one senior and two junior).

Whips act in an administrative role, making sure members of their party are in the debating chamber when required and organising members of their party to speak during debates. Since the introduction of proportional representation in 1996, divisions that require all members in the chamber to vote by taking sides (termed a &quot;personal vote&quot;) are rarely used, except for conscience votes. Instead, one of the party&#x27;s whips votes on behalf of all the members of their party, by declaring how many members are in favour and/or how many members are opposed. They also cast proxy votes for single-member parties whose member is not in the chamber at the time of the vote, and also cast proxy votes during personal votes for absent members of their parties and for absent members of associated single-member parties.

===United Kingdom===
In British politics, the chief whip of the governing party in the House of Commons is customarily appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury so that the incumbent, who represents the whips in general, has a seat and a voice in the Cabinet. By virtue of holding the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, the government chief whip has an official residence at 12 Downing Street, although the chief whip&#x27;s office is currently located at 9 Downing Street. Government whips report to the prime minister on any possible backbench revolts and the general opinion of MPs within the party, and upon the exercise of patronage, which is used to motivate and reward loyalty.

The role of whips is largely to ensure that MPs vote as required by the party leadership, i.e. to secure the government&#x27;s business, and to protect the prime minister. Whips use a combination of threats and promises to secure compliance. A former chief whip said that there was a dividing line between legitimate and illegitimate persuasion: &quot;Yes to threats on preferment (for government positions) and honours. No to abusing public money, such as threatening to withhold money from projects in the MP&#x27;s constituency, and private lives.&quot; Former chief whips disclosed that whips have a notebook documenting MPs&#x27; indiscretions, and that they help MPs in any sort of trouble (&quot;it might be debt, it might be ... a scandal involving small boys ...&quot;) in any way they can to &quot;store up brownie points ... that sounds a pretty, pretty nasty reason, but it&#x27;s one of the reasons because if we could get a chap out of trouble then he will do as we ask forever more.&quot;

==== Having the whip withdrawn ====
Having the whip withdrawn means the MP is effectively expelled from their party. UK parties do not have the power to expel an MP from parliament, but can force the MP to sit as an independent and remove them from ministerial office.

&quot;Losing the whip is seen by many as one of the strongest punishments a political party can dole out to its MPs. The move essentially expels the member from their party, meaning that while they can remain on the green benches, they have to sit as an independent MP.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.sky/12784304&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

&quot;... severe punishment. The most severe is &quot;having the whip withdrawn&quot; - which means you are kicked out of the party within Parliament.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/49578000&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Defying a three-line whip is very serious, and has occasionally resulted in the whip being withdrawn from an MP or Lord. This means that the Member is effectively expelled from their party (but keeps their seat) and must sit as an independent until the whip is restored.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.uk/whips&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other countries==
=== Italy ===
Most parliamentary groups in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic appoint a &#x27; (Secretary) or &#x27; (Floor Secretary), who enforces party discipline in the same way a whip does in English-speaking nations. The Minister for Parliamentary Relations also often acts like a whip, but works for the incumbent governing coalition as a whole rather than for a single specific party or parliamentary group.

===Spain===
In both houses of the , the Spanish legislature, political parties appoint a member to the role of &quot;&quot; (deputy spokesperson), which is the third authority of the parliamentary group after the leader and the spokesperson. The deputy spokesperson enforces party discipline in every vote, being thus the equivalent of a party whip in English-speaking countries.

===South Africa===
Although South Africa uses a proportional representation system, the concept of a political party whip, which was inherited from colonial British rule, has been maintained.

In 2017, African National Congress secretary general Gwede Mantashe said &quot;Voting according to conscience doesn&#x27;t work in a political party system. We all get into the list of things and go to Parliament as parliamentarians of the ANC [...] There will be no voting against the ANC.&quot;

===Taiwan===
Party whips exist in most of the major parties of the Legislative Yuan. For example, in the Democratic Progressive Party the party whip is the Caucus leader. In the Kuomintang the party whip is the executive director of the Policy Committee or the caucus leader.

When voting for critical bills, whips may issue a top-mobilization order asking members to attend the assembly. Party members failing to obey the order are suspended or expelled from the party.

===United States===

In the United States there are legislatures at the local (city councils, town councils, county boards, etc.), state, and federal levels. The federal legislature (Congress), the legislatures in all states except for Nebraska, and many county and city legislative bodies are divided along party lines and have whips, as well as majority and minority leaders. The whip is also the assistant majority or assistant minority leader.

Both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and Senate, have majority and minority whips. They in turn have subordinate &quot;regional&quot; whips. While members of Congress often vote along party lines, the influence of the whip is weaker than in the UK system; American politicians have considerably more freedom to diverge from the party line and vote according to their conscience or their constituents&#x27; preferences. One reason is that a considerable amount of money is raised by individual candidates. Furthermore, nobody, including members of Congress, can be expelled from a political party, which is formed simply by open registration. Because preselection of candidates for office is generally done through a primary election open to a wide number of voters, candidates who support their constituents&#x27; positions rather than those of their party leaders cannot easily be rejected by their party, due to a democratic mandate.

Because, unlike members of a parliament, members of Congress cannot serve simultaneously in Executive Branch positions, a whip in the United States cannot bargain for votes by promising promotion or threatening demotion in a sitting administration. There is, however, a highly structured committee system in both houses of Congress, and a whip may be able to offer promotion or threaten demotion within that system. In the House of Representatives, the influence of a single member individually is relatively small and therefore depends a great deal on the representative&#x27;s seniority (i.e., in most cases, on the length of time they have held office).

In the Senate, the majority whip is the third-highest ranking individual in the majority party (the party with the most seats). The majority whip is outranked by the majority leader and, unofficially, the president pro tempore of the Senate. As the office of president pro tempore is largely honorific and usually given to the longest-serving senator of the majority, the majority whip is in reality the second-ranking senator in the majority conference. Similarly, in the House, the majority whip is outranked by both the majority leader and the speaker. Unlike the Senate&#x27;s presiding officer, the Speaker is the leader of his or her party&#x27;s caucus in the House.

In both the House and the Senate, the minority whip is the second highest-ranking individual in the minority party (the party with the lesser number of legislators in a legislative body), outranked only by the minority leader.

The whip position was created in the House of Representatives in 1897 by Republican Speaker Thomas Reed, who appointed James A. Tawney as the first whip. The first Democratic whip, Oscar Wilder Underwood, was appointed in about 1900. In the Senate, the position was created in 1913 by John W. Kern, chair of the Democratic caucus, when he appointed J. Hamilton Lewis as the first whip, while Republicans later chose James Wadsworth as the party&#x27;s first in 1915.

==In popular culture==
Michael Dobbs, formerly Chief of Staff for British Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wrote a trilogy of books, centred around a fictional party whip named Francis Urquhart, which was dramatised and broadcast by the BBC between 1990 and 1995. The first book in the trilogy, titled &quot;House of Cards&quot;, was adapted into a television series of the same name, and the title was also used for subsequent series based on other countries&#x27; political systems. In &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Francis Urquhart is the chief whip for the UK Conservative Party and the trilogy charts his ambitious rise through his party&#x27;s ranks until he becomes Prime Minister.

In the American remake of &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Frank Underwood is the House Majority Whip for the US Democratic Party. The series charts Underwood&#x27;s ambitious rise through his party&#x27;s ranks until he becomes president. The name &quot;Frank Underwood&quot; was chosen to have the same initials as the original trilogy&#x27;s protagonist Francis Urquhart, and to reference Oscar Underwood, the first party whip for the US Democratic Party.

The song &quot;Demolition Man&quot; by The Police references party whips in the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m a three-line whip, I&#x27;m the sort of thing they ban.&quot;

The &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Scofflaw&quot; features a scene where Kramer explains that the term &quot;whip&quot; originated from the practice of physically whipping party members to force voting compliance.

<text>Carl Edwin Wieman (born March 26, 1951) is an American physicist and educationist at Stanford University, and currently the A. D. White Professor at Large at Cornell University. In 1995, while at the University of Colorado Boulder, he and Eric Allin Cornell produced the first true Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) and, in 2001, they and Wolfgang Ketterle (for further BEC studies) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Wieman currently holds a joint appointment as Professor of Physics and Professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Education, as well as the DRC Professor in the Stanford University School of Engineering. In 2020, Wieman was awarded the Yidan Prize in Education Research for &quot;his contribution in developing new techniques and tools in STEM education&quot;.

==Biography==
Wieman was born in Corvallis, Oregon to N. Orr Wieman and Alison Marjorie Fry in the United States and graduated from Corvallis High School. His paternal grandfather Henry Nelson Wieman was a religious philosopher of German descent and his mother had white Anglo-Saxon Protestant family background. Wieman earned his B.S. in 1973 from MIT and his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1977; he was also awarded a Doctor of Science, &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Chicago in 1997. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1998. In 2001, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Eric Allin Cornell and Wolfgang Ketterle, for fundamental studies of the Bose-Einstein condensate. In 2004, he was named United States Professor of the Year among all doctoral and research universities.

In a 2020 interview given to Federal University of Pará in Brazil, Wieman recalls his youth and his journey as a physicist; the influence of other people, like teachers and his parents, on his trajectory; his path through science education and the foundation of the open educational resource PhET Interactive Simulations.

Wieman joined the University of British Columbia on 1 January 2007 and headed a well-endowed science education initiative there; he retained a twenty percent appointment at the University of Colorado Boulder to head the science education project he founded in Colorado. On 1 September 2013, Wieman joined Stanford University with a joint appointment in the physics department and the Graduate School of Education.

In the past several years, Wieman has been particularly involved with efforts at improving science education and has conducted educational research on science instruction. Wieman served as Chair of the Board on Science Education of the National Academy of Sciences from 2005 to 2009. He has used and promotes Eric Mazur&#x27;s peer instruction, a pedagogical system where teachers repeatedly ask multiple-choice concept questions during class, and students reply on the spot with little wireless &quot;clicker&quot; devices. If a large proportion of the class chooses a wrong answer, students discuss among themselves and reply again. In 2007, Wieman was awarded the Oersted Medal, which recognizes notable contributions to the teaching of physics, by the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT).

Wieman is the founder and chairman of PhET, a web-based directive of University of Colorado Boulder which provides an extensive suite of simulations to improve the way that physics, chemistry, biology, earth science and math are taught and learned. Link

Wieman is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board. Wieman was nominated to be The White House&#x27;s Office of Science and Technology Policy Associate Director of Science on March 24, 2010. His hearing in front of the Commerce committee occurred on May 20, 2010, and he was passed by unanimous consent. On September 16, 2010, Dr. Wieman was confirmed by unanimous consent. He left that post in June 2012 to battle multiple myeloma.

<doc id="242246" wikidata="Q862809" url="?curid=242246" title="Wyvern">
<text>The wyvern ( , sometimes spelled wivern) is a type of mythical dragon with two legs, two wings, and often a pointed tail.

The wyvern in its various forms is important in heraldry, frequently appearing as a mascot of schools and athletic teams (chiefly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada). It is a popular creature in European literature, mythology, and folklore. Today, it is often used in fantasy literature and video games. The wyvern in heraldry and folklore is rarely fire-breathing, unlike other dragons.

== Etymology ==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word is a development of Middle English &quot;wyver&quot; (attested fourteenth century), from Anglo-French (cf. French &quot;guivre&quot; and &quot;vouivre&quot;), which originate from Latin &quot;vīpera&quot;, meaning &quot;viper&quot;, &quot;adder&quot;, or &quot;asp&quot;. The concluding &quot;&quot;–n&quot; had been added by the beginning of the 17th century, when John Guillim in 1610 describes the &quot;wiverne&quot;&quot; as a creature that &quot;partake[s] of a Fowle in the Wings and Legs ... and doth resemble a Serpent in the Taile&quot;. John Gibbon in 1682 emphasises that it &quot;hath but two Legs&quot;.

Conversely, medievalist William Sayers proposes a more complex origin for the term. He notes that the Anglo-French &quot;guivre&quot; and its Middle English derivative ceased to retain the original sense of &quot;venomous snake&quot; after the Latin term was re-introduced into medieval Latin, freeing them up to take an alternative meaning. Adducing another meaning of &quot;wiver&quot; (this time Old English) and &quot;guivre&quot;, &quot;light javelin&quot;, and noting partial resemblances between the size and shape of javelins and snakes, plus the later medieval era&#x27;s increasing use of heavy armor and decreasing use of light javelins, he proposes that the concepts of &quot;venomous snake&quot; and &quot;light javelin&quot; were melded to produce a new term for a previously unimagined concept of flying snake, a kind of dragon.

The concept of winged snakes, mythical creatures similar to wyverns, is common in cultures around the Mediterranean, with a notable example being the Egyptian goddess Wadjet. The oldest creatures outright referred to as &quot;winged dragons&quot; are Helios&#x27;s chariot steeds, which aid Medea.

In British heraldry, the term &quot;wyver&quot; first appears in Great Roll in 1312, and is derived from the Old French &quot;wyvre&quot;, meaning &quot;serpent&quot;. The term &quot;dragon&quot; appears by the following century. Afterwards, four-legged dragons become increasingly popular in heraldry and become distinguished from the two-legged kind during the sixteenth century, at which point the latter kind becomes commonly known as the &quot;wyver&quot; and later &quot;wyvern&quot;.

== Distinction from other dragons ==

Since the sixteenth century, in English, Welsh, Scottish, French and Irish heraldry, heraldic wyverns are defined as distinct entities from heraldic dragons. The key difference has been that a wyvern has two legs, whereas a dragon has four. This distinction is not commonly observed in the heraldry of other European countries, where two-legged dragon creatures are simply called dragons.

== In modern fiction ==

The wyvern frequently features in modern fantasy fiction, such as &quot;Fourth Wing&quot;, though its first literary appearances may have been in medieval bestiaries.

== In heraldry ==
The wyvern is a frequent charge in English heraldry and vexillology, also occasionally appearing as a supporter or crest.

A wyvern is typically depicted resting upon its legs and tail, but may be depicted with its claws in the air and only supported by its tail. On occasion, a wyvern may be depicted as wingless and with its tail nowed.

A silver (argent) wyvern formed the crest of the Borough of Leicester as recorded at the heraldic visitation of Leicestershire in 1619: &quot;A wyvern sans legs argent strewed with wounds gules, wings expanded ermine.&quot; The term &quot;sans legs&quot; may not imply that the wyvern was &quot;without legs&quot;, rather than its legs are not depicted, being hidden or folded under. This was adopted by the Midland Railway in 1845 when it became the crest of its unofficial coat of arms. The company asserted that the &quot;wyvern was the standard of the Kingdom of Mercia&quot;, and that it was &quot;a quartering in the town arms of Leicester&quot;. However, in 1897 the &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; noted that there appeared &quot;to be no foundation that the wyvern was associated with the Kingdom of Mercia&quot;. It has been associated with Leicester since the time of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster and Leicester (c. 1278–1322), the most powerful lord in the Midlands, who used it as his personal crest.

A green wyvern stands in the emblem of the ancient Umbrian city of Terni; the dragon is called by the name Thyrus by the citizens. A sable wyvern on a white background with endorsed wings forms the coat of arms of the Tilley family.

The arms of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries depict a wyvern, symbolising disease, being overcome by Apollo, symbolising medicine.

Wyvern Zilant is depicted on the coat of arms of the city of Kazan, the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan.

== As a logo or mascot ==

The wyvern is a popular commercial logo or mascot, especially in Wales and what was once the West Country Kingdom of Wessex, but also in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, as the rivers Wye and Severn run through Hereford and Worcester respectively. A local radio station was formerly called Wyvern FM. Vauxhall Motors had a model in its range in the 1950s called the Wyvern. The Westland Wyvern was a British single-seat carrier-based multi-role strike aircraft built by Westland Aircraft that served in the 1950s, seeing active service in the 1956 Suez Crisis.

*The wyvern is a frequent mascot of athletic teams, colleges and universities, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States, and was the mascot of the former Korea Baseball Organization team SK Wyverns, established in 2000, King&#x27;s College, within the University of Queensland, and the Japanese basketball team, the Passlab Yamagata Wyverns of the Japanese B.League.
*The wyvern is also the mascot of the 51st Operations Support Squadron at Osan Air Base, with the motto: &quot;breathin&#x27; fire!&quot;
*A wyvern is depicted on the unit crest of the USAF 31st Fighter Wing.
*A wyvern is featured on the club crests of both Leyton Orient F.C. and Carlisle United F.C.
*A wyvern is featured as the team mascot for Woodbridge College in Woodbridge, Ontario, Canada.
*A wyvern is the mascot of Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester, Massachusetts.
*A wyvern is the logo of LLVM, the compiler infrastructure project.
*A wyvern is the logo of the Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt.
*A wyvern is the emblem of East London Rugby Football Club.
*Wyvern is the a nickname of a fictional aircraft in the Ace Combat series: the X-02 Wyvern.

<text>Taxaceae (), commonly called the yew family, is a coniferous family which includes six extant and two extinct genera, and about 30 species of plants, or in older interpretations three genera and 7 to 12 species.

== Description ==
They are many-branched, small trees and shrubs. The leaves are evergreen, spirally arranged, often twisted at the base to appear 2-ranked. They are linear to lanceolate, and have pale green or white stomatal bands on the undersides.

The plants are dioecious, or rarely monoecious. The catkin like male cones are long, and shed pollen in the early spring. They are sometimes externally only slightly differentiated from the branches. The fertile bracts have 2-8 pollen sacs.

The female &#x27;cones&#x27; are highly reduced. Only the upper or uppermost bracts are fertile and bear one or rarely two seeds. The ovule usually exceeds the scale, although ovules are sometimes rarely enclosed by it. They may be found on the ends of branches or on the branches. They may grow singly or in tufts or clumps.

As the seed matures, a fleshy aril partly encloses it. The developmental origin of the aril is unclear, but it may represent a fused pair of swollen leaves. The mature aril is brightly coloured, soft, juicy and sweet, and is eaten by birds which then disperse the hard seed undamaged in their droppings. However, the seeds are highly poisonous to humans, containing the poisons taxine and taxol.

== Distribution ==
Species are mostly found in the tropics and temperate zones in the northern temperate. There are only a few species in the southern hemisphere.

==Classification==
Taxaceae is now generally included with all other conifers in the order Pinales, as DNA analysis has shown that the yews are phylogenetically nested in the Pinales, a conclusion supported by studies. Formerly they were often treated as distinct from other conifers by placing them in a separate order Taxales. Ernest Henry Wilson referred to Taxaceae as &quot;taxads&quot; in his 1916 book. Taxaceae is thought to be the sister group to Cupressaceae, from which it diverged during the early-mid Triassic. The clade comprising both is sister to Sciadopityaceae, which diverged from them during the early-mid Permian. The oldest confirmed member of Taxaceae is &quot;Palaeotaxus rediviva&quot; from the earliest Jurassic (Hettangian) of Sweden. Fossils belonging to the living genus &quot;Amentotaxus&quot; from the Middle Jurassic of China indicate that Taxaceae had already substantially diversified during the Jurassic.

The broadly defined Taxaceae (including &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot;) comprises six extant genera and about 30 species overall. &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot; is now included in Taxaceae, rather than being recognized as the core of its own family, Cephalotaxaceae. Phylogenetic evidence strongly supports a very close relationship between &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot; and other members of Taxaceae, and morphological differences between them are not substantial. Previous recognition of two distinct families, Taxaceae and Cephalotaxaceae (e.g.,), was based on relatively minor morphological details: Taxaceae (excluding &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot;) has smaller mature seeds growing to in 6–8 months, that are not fully enclosed by the aril; in contrast, &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot; seeds have a longer maturation period (from 18–20 months), and larger mature seeds () fully enclosed by the aril. However, there are also very clear morphological connections between &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot; and other members of Taxaceae, and considered in tandem with the phylogenetic evidence, there is no compelling need to recognize &quot;Cephalotaxus&quot; (or other genera in Taxaceae) as a distinct family.

<text>is a district in Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. It is known for the Sensō-ji, a Buddhist temple dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon. There are several other temples in Asakusa, as well as various festivals, such as the .

==History==

The development of Asakusa as an entertainment district during the Edo period came about in part because of the neighboring district, Kuramae. Kuramae was a district of storehouses for rice, which was then used as payment for servants of the feudal government. The keepers () of these storage houses initially stored the rice for a small fee, but over the years began exchanging the rice for money or selling it to local shopkeepers at a margin. Through such trading, many came to have a considerable amount of disposable income and as result theaters and geisha houses began to spring up in nearby Asakusa.

For most of the 20th century, Asakusa remained a major entertainment district in Tokyo. The or &quot;Sixth District&quot; was in particular famous as a theater district, featuring famous cinemas such as the Denkikan. The golden years of Asakusa are vividly portrayed in Yasunari Kawabata&#x27;s novel &quot;The Scarlet Gang of Asakusa&quot; (1930). The area was heavily damaged by US bombing raids during World War II, particularly the 10 March 1945 firebombing of Tokyo. The area was rebuilt after the war, but has now been surpassed by Shinjuku and other colorful areas in the city in its role as a pleasure district.

Asakusa was a ward of Tokyo City. In 1947, when the city was transformed into a metropolis, it was merged with Shitaya to form the modern Taito ward. The former ward encompassed 19 neighborhoods in the eastern half of Taitō.

==Geography==
Asakusa is on the north-east fringe of central Tokyo, at the eastern end of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line subway, approximately one mile east of the major railway/subway interchange. It is central to the area colloquially referred to as Shitamachi, which literally means &quot;low city,&quot; referring to the low elevation of this old part of Tokyo, on the banks of the Sumida River. As the name suggests, the area has a more traditionally Japanese atmosphere than some other neighborhoods in Tokyo do.

==Food and drink==

Asakusa has many restaurants and places to try traditional Japanese foods. One of the most popular treats is , sweet potatoes. Another special treat is , grilled fish cakes. The Suzuhiro store serves local craft beer with traditional . Asakusa is also known for spices such as and .

In a city where there are very few buildings older than 50 years because of the wartime bombing, Asakusa has a greater concentration of buildings from the 1950s and 1960s than most other areas in Tokyo do. There are traditional (guest-houses) and small-scale apartment buildings throughout the district.

In keeping with a peculiarly Tokyo tradition, Asakusa hosts a major cluster of domestic kitchenware stores on , which is visited by many Tokyoites for essential supplies. Next to the Sensō-ji temple grounds is a small amusement park called Hanayashiki, which claims to be the oldest amusement park in Japan. The neighborhood theaters specialize in showing classic Japanese films, as many of the tourists are elderly Japanese.

Cruises down the Sumida River depart from a wharf a five-minute walk from the temple.

Asakusa is Tokyo&#x27;s oldest geisha district, and still has 45 actively working geisha.

Because of its colourful location, downtown credentials, and relaxed atmosphere by Tokyo standards, Asakusa is a popular accommodation choice for budget travelers.

==Carnival==
The neighborhood is famous for its annual Brazilian style carnival. There is a significant Brazilian presence in the local community and the Association of Samba Schools of Asakusa is based there.
Although there are many festivals throughout the year in Asakusa, the most famous of them is the , also known as Sanja Festival, which takes place in May. In this festival, (portable shrines) and floats are pulled through the streets while loud shouts accompany them, and during the festival&#x27;s 3 days, 1.5 million people come out to celebrate.

==Transportation==
The district has two railway stations with the same name:

*Asakusa Station

*Asakusa Station
==Education==

Taitō City Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools.

<text>George Weedon (1734–1793) was an American military officer from Fredericksburg, Colony of Virginia, who served during the Revolutionary War. He held the rank of brigadier general in the Continental Army and later in the Virginia militia. After the Revolutionary War ended, he became an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati (Va.).

== Biography ==
Weedon served as a lieutenant under George Washington in the French and Indian War, primarily assigned to garrison duty in western Virginia. After the war, he moved to Fredericksburg and opened a tavern. It was within Weedon&#x27;s tavern that Thomas Jefferson wrote the Statute of Religious Freedom, in January 1777, the first document of its kind to acknowledge government recognition of religious tolerance. In 1775, he was made a lieutenant colonel and second in command to Hugh Mercer, tasked with creating the 3rd Virginia Regiment, Virginia Line, Continental Army. He was promoted to colonel in 1776 and succeeded Mercer in command of his regiment. Following Mercer&#x27;s death at Princeton, Weedon was promoted to brigadier general in 1777 and again succeeded him. He fought in the Battles of Trenton, Brandywine, and Germantown. At Valley Forge, Weedon commanded a brigade in Nathanael Greene&#x27;s division. His brigade included Stewart&#x27;s 13th Pennsylvania Regiment along with the 2nd, 6th, 10th, and 14th Virginia regiments.

In 1778, he resigned after a dispute with the Congress over seniority. He went home to Virginia to lead a brigade of the state&#x27;s militia at the request of Governor Thomas Jefferson. He led his militia unit in the Yorktown campaign, where his brigade successfully repelled the feared and infamous unit of Colonel Banastre Tarleton, thus closing the one means of British escape at.

Some of his many descendants who are alive today include Paul Ashford Weadon the third, Jared Weadon, Lisa Fell, Zoey Fell, Henry Fell, Blair Fell, Darcy Weadon, Ethan Weadon, and Grant Weadon. George’s last name has evolved over the centuries.

The town is named for Major James Thomas Morisset, who camped there in 1823 while making the overland journey from Sydney to Newcastle. Morisset went on to become Commandant at Norfolk Island prison between 1829 and 1833, where his brutal regime led to a rebellion. Historically there has been considerable confusion over the spelling of the suburb: Morissett, Morriset, Morrissett and Morrisset have been used.

Some sources state that the town was named after Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset, the son of James Morisset. However, a letter from Victor Sellheim, grandson of James Morisset, published in 1914, rejects this theory.

The earliest settlement in the area was at Cooranbong in 1826, about west of the current town and near the foot of the Watagan Mountains. Initially, various kinds of agriculture were conducted, and before long forestry became an important industry. Most of the transport to the area at the time was by river boat on Dora Creek meaning that Cooranbong was the most accessible part of town. The town of Morisset itself was essentially non-existent until 1887, when the Sydney-Newcastle railway was built. Morisset sprang up as a sawmill town clustered around the train station, and the township was proclaimed on 3 December.

In 1908, a psychiatric hospital opened on a large estate along the lake shore. At its height in the 1960s, Morisset Mental Hospital had 1,600 patients. The Hospital continues to dominate Morisset&#x27;s reputation, although it is now only a 130-bed hospital.

The first bus service was started by the Ward family.

In more recent times, the Morisset Peninsula to the east of the town has become the main residential area. It has experienced a high rate of growth since the construction of Eraring Power Station in 1986. Several retirement villages have been built. Subdivision of larger blocks has come close to saturation in many suburbs, with only a few hobby-farms still remaining, although the majority of the Morisset district and peninsula remain bushland and National Park and Aboriginal reserves.

==Heritage listings==
Morisset has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Morisset Park Road: Morisset Hospital

==Education==
Morisset contains a state primary school, a state high school and a Catholic school. Morisset Public School opened in 1891 and started accommodating high school classes in 1951. These classes transferred to a new high school campus, Morisset High School, at the start of the 1965 school year, with the public school returning to purely primary education.

A Catholic primary school, St John Vianney School, opened on 17 January 1962, and was initially administered by the Sisters of St Joseph until becoming part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle in 1966.

==Transport==

Morisset railway station, located on Dora Street, is linked to Sydney and Newcastle by NSW TrainLink services on the Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line, and to Maitland and towns further north by long-distance services.

The train station serves as a terminus for bus services 278 and 279 covering the Morisset Peninsula towns and 280 to Cooranbong. These services are operated by Hunter Valley Buses, which acquired the previous provider Toronto Bus. In July 2009, Rover Coaches commenced a new weekday service, Route 163, to Cessnock and Kurri Kurri.

==Tourism==
Morisset is located along the eastern waterways of Lake Macquarie within proximity to the Watagans National Park at the foot of the Watagan Mountains. The town centre has a range of commercial sites with shops, cafes and restaurants. Morisset is the gateway to the secluded network of trails and paths that connect the Lake Macquarie region.

Dillwynia Bushland Reserve is located directly to the south of Morisset railway station. The land is managed by members of the Biraban Local Aboriginal Land Council.

== Media ==
Christian radio may be heard on 87.8 FM around the town broadcasting 3ABN Australia Radio Network.
3ABN Australia Production Centre is also located in Morisset.

<text>Ginza ( ; ) is a district of Chūō, Tokyo, located south of Yaesu and Kyōbashi, west of Tsukiji, east of Yūrakuchō and Uchisaiwaichō, and north of Shinbashi. It is a popular upscale shopping area of Tokyo, with numerous internationally renowned department stores, boutiques, restaurants and coffeehouses located in its vicinity. It is considered to be one of the most expensive, elegant, and luxurious city districts in the world.

Ginza was a part of the old Kyobashi ward of Tokyo City, which, together with Nihonbashi and Kanda, formed the core of Shitamachi, the original downtown center of Edo (Tokyo).

== History ==
Ginza was built upon a former swamp that was filled in during the 16th century. The name Ginza comes after the establishment of a silver-coin mint established there in 1612, during the Edo period.

After a devastating fire in 1872 burned down most of the area, the Meiji government designated the Ginza area as a &quot;model of modernization.&quot; The government planned the construction of fireproof brick buildings and larger, better streets connecting Shimbashi Station all the way to the foreign concession in Tsukiji.

Soon after the fire, redevelopment schemes were prepared by Colin Alexander McVean a chief surveyor of the Public Works under direction of Yamao Yozo, but execution designs were provided by the Irish-born engineer Thomas Waters; the Bureau of Construction of the Ministry of Finance was in charge of construction. The following year, a Western-style shopping promenade on the street from the Shinbashi bridge to the Kyōbashi bridge in the southwestern part of Chūō with two- and three-story Georgian brick buildings was completed.

These &quot;bricktown&quot; buildings were initially offered for sale and later were leased, but the high rent prevented many of them from being occupied long term. Moreover, the construction was not adapted to the climate, and the bold design conflicted with traditional Japanese architectural styles found at the time. The new Ginza was not popular with visiting foreigners, who were looking for a more Edo-styled city. Isabella Bird visited in 1878 and in 1880 implied that Ginza was less like an Oriental city than like the outskirts of Chicago or Melbourne. Philip Terry, an English writer of tour guides, likened it to Broadway, however not in a positive sense.

Nevertheless, the area flourished as a symbol of &quot;civilization and enlightenment&quot; thanks to the presence of various newspapers and magazine companies, which helped spread the latest trends of the day. The area was also known for its window displays, an example of modern marketing techniques. The area became a popular shopping and meeting destination, with the custom of &quot;killing time in Ginza&quot; developing strongly between the two world wars.

Most of these European-style buildings have disappeared, but some older buildings still remain, most famously the Wakō building with the now-iconic Hattori Clock Tower. The building and the clock tower were originally built by Kintarō Hattori, the founder of Seiko.

Its recent history has seen it as a prominent outpost of Western luxury shops such as Louis Vuitton and Giorgio Armani. Ginza is a popular destination on weekends, as the main north–south artery has been closed to traffic since the 1960s, under governor Ryokichi Minobe.

== Economy ==
Many leading fashion houses&#x27; flagship stores are located here, with the area having the highest concentration of Western shops in Tokyo. It is one of two locations in Tokyo considered by Chevalier and Mazzalovo to be the best locations for a luxury goods store. Prominent high-end retailers include the American company Carolina Herrera New York, French companies Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent, Italian company Gucci and Austrian brands Swarovski and Riedel.

Ginza is also home to many kimono stores, including Ginza Motoji, Echigo-ya, and Erizen. Many people choose to wear their kimono to visit Ginza and window shop.

Flagship electronic retail stores like the Sony showroom (which closed in 2017 and new building would open in 2022) and the first Apple Store outside the United States can be found here (Ginza 2 chome). The electronics company Ricoh is headquartered in the Ricoh Building in Ginza. The neighborhood is a major shopping district. It is home to Wako department store, which is located in a building dating from 1894. The building has a clock tower. There are many department stores in the area, including Hankyu, Seibu, and Matsuya, in which there are many shops: grocery stores, restaurants, women and men clothes, sportswear, and jewellers etc. There are also art galleries.
Kabuki-za is the theater for kabuki, and is located between Ginza and Tsukiji. The building was first opened in 1889 and has been reconstructed several times due to war damage and fire. The present building was built in 2013.

 is a sushi restaurant in Ginza which is owned and operated by sushi master Jiro Ono. It was the first sushi restaurant in the world to receive three stars from the Michelin Guide, although it was removed from the Michelin Guide in November 2019 because it does not accept reservations from the general public.

==Pedestrianization==

Each Saturday and Sunday, from 12:00 p.m. until 5:00 p.m., the main street through Ginza is closed off to road traffic, allowing people to walk freely. This is called or &quot;Hokoten&quot; for short, literally meaning &quot;pedestrian heaven&quot;. There are some people who do street performance such as magic and playing instruments. As a famous photo spot, some cats sleep on signs, where people can put their own cats onto these signs. The location where cats are is different depending on the date.

<doc id="242261" wikidata="Q127838" url="?curid=242261" title="Petting, Bavaria">
<text>Petting is a municipality in the district Traunstein, Bavaria, Germany. It is located on the shore of the Waginger See, a diluvial lake.

The first mention of the municipality was in 1048 with the name &quot;Pettinga&quot;; however, it is possible that the settlement already existed at the time of the Roman Empire. In 1180 it came into the ownership of the monastery St. Zeno.

== History ==
Petting, built on a wash-up from the last Ice age, is said to have once been an island when large areas were still under water. The island was considered safe and secure and was already inhabited at that time.

The place is said to have had a church as early as 800, but it was destroyed by the Hungarians around 900. On the square of the church stood allegedly the castle of the nobles of Pettingen. This noble family dates back to the 6th century. It is assumed that the following lords took the name of the village as their own. It is also assumed that Petting already existed in Roman times and had the same name at that time. 

The village was first mentioned in 1048 as &quot;Pettinga&quot;. In 1335, the parish of Petting was incorporated into the monastery of St. Zeno in Reichenhall. Petting was the seat of a chair of the Archbishopric of Salzburg and fell to Archduke Ferdinand of Tuscany during secularization in 1803, to Austria in 1805, which Petting had to cede to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810. Petting then became an independent political municipality through the municipal edict of 1818.

<text>The plant order Taxales was until recently treated as a distinct order in the division Pinophyta, class Pinopsida, and included only those species in the family Taxaceae, known commonly as yews. Under this interpretation, all other conifers were classified separately in the order Pinales. Recent genetic and studies, however, have shown the Taxaceae are closely related to the other conifers, particularly so to the family Cephalotaxaceae. The order Taxales is therefore no longer recognised as distinct, and the family Taxaceae is now included in the order Cupressales. See Pinophyta for more details.

<doc id="242271" wikidata="Q327510" url="?curid=242271" title="Buriram province">
<text>Buriram province (, , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-seven Provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) and lies in lower northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from south clockwise) Sa Kaeo, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Maha Sarakham, and Surin. The name &quot;Buriram&quot; means &#x27;city of happiness&#x27;.

==Geography==
Buriram is at the south end of the Khorat Plateau, with several extinct volcanoes around the province. The southern limit of the province is a mountainous area at the limit between the Sankamphaeng Range and the Dângrêk Mountains. The total forest area is or 8.8 percent of provincial area.

===National park===
There is one national park, along with three other national parks, make up region 1 (Prachinburi) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Ta Phraya National Park, 

===Wildlife sanctuary===
There is one wildlife sanctuary, along with two other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 7 (Nakhon Ratchasima) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas. 
* Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary, 

==History==
The study of archaeologists has found evidence of human habitation since prehistoric times in Dvaravati period in Buriram including cultural evidence from the ancient Khmer Empire, which has both a brick castle and more than 60 stone castles, and have found important archaeological sites, including kilns, pottery and pottery, earthenware called Khmer wares, which determines the age around the 15th-18th. After the period of ancient Khmer or Khmer culture, the historical evidence of Buriram began to appear again at the end of the Ayutthaya period, which appears to be an old city and later appeared in the Thonburi period to the Rattanakosin period that Buriram was a city.

About a thousand years ago, the area that makes up today&#x27;s Buriram Province was under the Khmer Empire and many ruins remain from that time. The largest, standing on an extinct volcano, is in the Phanom Rung Historical Park. According to an inscription found there, its local ruler recognised the authority of the Khmer king. However, the area was remote and sparsely populated, and little is recorded about it until the Rattanakosin Kingdom. In the early-19th century, Muang Pae, the largest town, acknowledged Thai sovereignty and was renamed Buriram. Following administrative reforms in the late-19th century, Buriram was formally incorporated into Thailand as a province with its own governor.

==Culture ==
===Festivals===
Aside from important religious days, Songkran Day and New Year&#x27;s Day, Buriram also has other local festivals such as the festival of the 5th lunar month when the locals make merit, bathe Buddha images and the aged, play traditional sports such as Saba and tug of war. In some areas like Phutthaisong District, there is the Bang Fai traditional rocket dance, Khao Phansa, at the beginning of Buddhist Lent and Loi Krathong.

==Demographics==
Buriram is one of the northeastern provinces with a sizable Northern Khmer population. The Isan language is spoken by most, but according to the most recent census 27.6% of the population also speak Northern Khmer in everyday life.

== Symbols ==

The provincial seal depicts Phanom Rung temple, a Khmer-style Hindu shrine dedicated to Shiva. It was in use from the 9th through the 12th centuries, when the Khmer Empire&#x27;s control of the region was ended by the Thais of Ayutthaya Kingdom. The ruins are now preserved in a historical park.

The provincial flower is the yellow cotton tree (&quot;Cochlospermum regium&quot;). The provincial tree is the pink shower (&quot;Cassia grandis&quot;). The Asian glass shrimp (&quot;Macrobrachium lanchesteri&quot;) is the provincial aquatic animal.

The province&#x27;s motto is &quot;the city of sandstone sanctuaries, land of volcanoes, beautiful silk, rich culture and the best city of sport&quot;.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 23 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further divided into 189 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 2,212 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

State Railway of Thailand (SRT), the national passenger rail system, provides service to Buriram at the Buriram Railway Station. SRT provides many services such as limited express trains to Bangkok and Ubon Ratchathani, commuter trains to Nakhon Ratchasima and beyond.

The Transport Co., Ltd. operates a bus depot at Buriram Bus Station, and Nakhonchai Air has its bus station adjacent.

===Public transit===
The Buriram Songthaew System (BSS) provides public transportation for the city. BSS was established many years ago. There are two lines: Line 1 (Buriram Municipality Market-Khao Kradong Forest Park Line), and Line 2 (Ban Bua Line). Both lines are colored pink.

== Health ==
Buriram&#x27;s main hospital is Buriram Hospital operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

== Sports ==
Buriram promotes itself as a city of sport. Buriram United is the most successful football team in Thailand after sweeping all before them by winning the league, the FA Cup, the League Cup, and AFC Champions League quarter-finalist. Buriram United play home games at Chang Arena, the largest club-owned football stadium in Thailand.

A FIA Grade 1 and FIM Grade A racing circuit, Chang International Circuit, is near Chang Arena.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>Guy Waldo Dunnington (January 15, 1906, Bowling Green, Missouri – April 10, 1974, Natchitoches, Louisiana) was a writer, historian and professor of German known for his writings on the famous German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Dunnington wrote several articles about Gauss and later a biography entitled &quot;Gauss: Titan of Science&quot; (). He became interested in Gauss through one of his elementary school teachers, Minna Waldeck Gauss Reeves, who was a great-granddaughter of Gauss.

Dunnington was also a translator at the Nuremberg trials. He ended his teaching career at Northwestern State University, which houses his collection of Gauss-related material, believed to be the largest collection of its kind in the world. He became Dean of international students there near the end of his life.

<doc id="242279" wikidata="Q7515014" url="?curid=242279" title="Silicon bandgap temperature sensor">
<text>The silicon bandgap temperature sensor is an extremely common form of temperature sensor (thermometer) used in electronic equipment. Its main advantage is that it can be included in a silicon integrated circuit at very low cost. The principle of the sensor is that the forward voltage of a silicon diode, which may be the base-emitter junction of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), is temperature-dependent, according to the following equation:
:formula_1
where
:&quot;T&quot; = temperature in kelvins,
:&quot;T&quot;0 = reference temperature,
:&quot;V&quot;&quot;G&quot;0 = bandgap voltage at absolute zero,
:&quot;V&quot;&quot;BE&quot;0 = junction voltage at temperature &quot;T&quot;0 and current &quot;I&quot;C0,
:&quot;k&quot; = Boltzmann constant,
:&quot;q&quot; = charge on an electron,
:&quot;n&quot; = a device-dependent constant.
By comparing the voltages of two junctions at the same temperature, but at two different currents, &quot;I&quot;C1 and &quot;I&quot;C2, many of the variables in the above equation can be eliminated, resulting in the relationship:
:formula_2

Note that the junction voltage is a function of current density, i.e. current/junction area, and a similar output voltage can be obtained by operating the two junctions at the same current, if one is of a different area to the other.

A circuit that forces &quot;I&quot;C1 and &quot;I&quot;C2 to have a fixed N:1 ratio,
gives the relationship:
:formula_3
An electronic circuit, such as the Brokaw bandgap reference, that measures Δ&quot;V&quot;&quot;BE&quot; can therefore be used to calculate the temperature of the diode. The result remains valid up to about 200 °C to 250 °C, when leakage currents become large enough to corrupt the measurement. Above these temperatures, materials such as silicon carbide can be used instead of silicon.

The voltage difference between two p-n junctions (e.g. diodes), operated at different current densities, is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT).

PTAT circuits using either BJT or CMOS transistors are widely used in temperature sensors (where we want the output to vary with temperature), and also in bandgap voltage references and other temperature-compensating circuits (where we want the same output at every temperature).

If high precision is not required it is enough to bias a diode with any constant low current and use its −2 mV/˚C thermal coefficient for temperature calculation, however this requires calibration for each diode type. This method is common in monolithic temperature sensors.

<text>The Galactic Republic, commonly known as The Republic, is a fictional political entity in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe that predates the formation of the Galactic Empire. It is prominently featured in the prequel trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, offering a glimpse into its history and functioning. In the original trilogy, which takes place after the events of the prequels, the Republic is referred to as the Old Republic, suggesting its long-established nature. In the prequel era, which takes place during the last years of the Republic, the term &quot;Old Republic&quot; referred to the Galactic Republic of ancient time, which was reorganized into the modern Republic a thousand years before the Battle of Yavin.

The Republic is portrayed as a democratic republic that has sustained itself peacefully for over twenty-five thousand years but was tied up in layers of bureaucracy. It was mainly overseen by the Galactic Senate, the Republic&#x27;s legislative branch. It was protected by the Jedi Order, the Guardians of peace and justice throughout the Star Wars galaxy. After the end of the Galactic Empire, the New Republic was founded. It was enforced by the original Rebel Alliance, eventually known as the New Republic Military. The consolidation of the New Republic is depicted in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; as it sought to wipe out remnants of the Imperial forces and was eventually destroyed by the First Order, under Supreme Leader Snoke&#x27;s direction, in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;.

== Fictional history (canon) ==
=== Fictional timeline (canon) ===

In the Star Wars chronology, the destruction of the first Death Star during the Battle of Yavin serves as a significant event used to establish the calendar era. The battle is depicted in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), the first film released in the franchise. Following this event, the conventional notation for standard years is &quot;BBY&quot; (Before the Battle of Yavin) and &quot;ABY&quot; (After the Battle of Yavin). Alternative notations such as &quot;BSW4&quot; (&quot;Before Star Wars Episode 4&quot;) and &quot;ASW4&quot; (&quot;After Star Wars Episode 4&quot;) may be used.
=== Background ===
In the Star Wars universe, the earliest history of the galaxy before the Republic is not extensively explored. However, it is believed that various species, including humans, evolved in the Core Worlds and eventually became dominant throughout the galaxy. According to the hypothesis, humans are thought to have originated from Coruscant, a central planet in the Star Wars galaxy. From there, they settled in other Core Worlds, such as Alderaan, and eventually expanded their presence to colonize other planets across the galaxy. According to Smith (1996), the origin of hyperdrive technology in the Star Wars galaxy is uncertain. It is speculated that hyperdrive might have been invented by the humans of the Core Worlds, or it could have been introduced to them by alien traders from the Unknown Regions. Regardless of its origin, there is a consensus that hyperspace travel predated the Republic and played a crucial role in enabling the formation of a &quot;galactic civilization.&quot; It allowed for interstellar travel and facilitated the establishment of central governments spanning multiple planetary systems, ultimately leading to the rise of the Galactic Republic.

=== Old Republic ===
According to the large body of films and other fiction that belong to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, the Old Republic was formed 25,000 years before the events of &quot;Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope&quot; (1977) when the first &quot;Galactic Constitution&quot; was signed on Coruscant, after hyperdrive connected many worlds in the Core and enabled the establishment of an interstellar central government. Coruscant became the capital planet of the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the New Republic, and the entire surface evolved into one big city, with skyscrapers reaching more than 5,000 levels. The Republic was made up of several hundred thousand worlds, and each planet or system had representation in the Republic Senate, which comprised most of the Republic&#x27;s Legislative Branch and the government itself. It started merely as an economic and protective alliance, mainly among the Core worlds. It eventually expanded to the Colonies and other outlying worlds and regions, becoming a superpower rather than an alliance, and it became the sole superpower in the galaxy. The Core Worlds, such as Coruscant and Alderaan, were notable for their prosperity, which was later matched by the Colonies, while the Inner Rim and Expansion Region were a bit less secure and wealthy; the Mid Rim was an unsafe region that saw much of the fighting Galactic Civil War on planets such as Naboo and Kashyyyk, as it was far from the Republic&#x27;s military concentrated in the Core. The Outer Rim was the most unsafe place in the galaxy, where neither the Republic nor the Empire ever gained much &quot;de facto&quot; hold, leading to lawlessness, widespread violence, and crime syndicates; many key battles of the Clone Wars took place here. A large part of the Outer Rim, including Tatooine was traditionally ruled by the Hutts and therefore called the Hutt Space.

As the Republic expanded, it came into contact with the slave empire of Zygerria. Because slavery was disallowed in the Republic, it disliked the Zygerrian Empire, as slavery was central to the Empire&#x27;s political and economic system; conversely, the Empire refused to become part of the Republic. The Republic and Jedi declared war on the Empire and won. The Empire was reduced to a small, harmless alliance on Zygerria.

=== Sith Empire and reforms ===
The Sith (which formed in the Republic&#x27;s early years) return to their original strength and invaded Malachor. The first Sith War began, which led to the demise of the first Republic. The power of the new Sith Empire increased as the Republic decreased. The Republic and Jedi forces failed to keep the Empire&#x27;s Forces out of Republic Space. Soon, the Sith became a second superpower. Around this time, an ancestor of Pre Vizsla stole the Darksaber from the Jedi Temple. Around 1000 years prior to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the Dark Age began, and the Old Republic was brought to the brink of collapse, but with the Liberation of Coruscant, the Sith Empire collapsed first. After the Sith Empire was defeated c. 1032 BBY, the Republic (now known as the Galactic Republic) reformed and became a democracy. It demilitarized at the Ruusan Reformation, shortly after the Seventh Battle of Ruusan.

=== High Republic ===
The multimedia project &quot;Star Wars: The High Republic&quot; depicts the galaxy 200 years before &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.

The Republic began to diplomatically influence its neighboring worlds rather than conquer them by force. This meant the Republic expanded slowly. The Republic finally took control of the Mid Rim.
Power blocs formed out of the Republic, but the Jedi kept order. The Republic became peaceful but corrupt, and a Core-Rim distrust formed. After Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum came to power, a standoff between the Trade Federation and the Republic led to the Invasion of Naboo (32 BBY), depicted in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;.

While the Republic flourished, the Empire of Zygerria tried to cause a war, known as the Zygerrian War. However, after a few minor battles, the Zygerrians quickly withdrew their army, since it stood no chance in this war.

=== Separatist Crisis ===
Several trade organizations represented in the Senate, such as the Trade Federation and Commerce Guild, kept armies of droids to protect their profits and occasionally took advantage of this, such as when the Trade Federation invaded and occupied Naboo. Individual sectors also maintained their security forces, such as the Naboo Security Force or the CorSec from Corellia, and these were sometimes used to combat small threats. However, there was no centralized and official military of the Republic. The Trade Federation and other cartels within the Republic desired that the Republic government lack significant central military power so that it could not enforce any legal regulations on their business.

Dissatisfied with several problems in the Republic, such as ineffectual government, heavy taxes, and perceived favoritism of the Core Worlds over the Outer Rim planets, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) was formed in 24 BBY: several systems seceded from the Republic and formed a new state, thus triggering the Separatist Crisis. The CIS was ostensibly headed by former Jedi Master Count Dooku (although Palpatine was actually in command of both sides), who gained much popularity among critics of the Republic after his scathing Raxus Address outlining the problems of the Republic, leading many systems to side with him and form the Confederacy. The Separatists became a huge threat to the Republic after some of the galaxy&#x27;s mega-corporations allied with the CIS, as they possessed vast resources and private armies of battle droids. A Military Creation Act was proposed in the Republic Senate, strongly opposed by many of the Republic&#x27;s pacifist leaders, such as Padmé Amidala, the Queen of Naboo, who feared the possibility of war. But most of the Senate advocated a permanent, official, and central military to oppose the Separatist threat. Supporters of the Act include Orn Free Taa of Ryloth and Ask Aak of Malastare. With the Formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems on Raxus Prime, a galactic wide Cold War between the Confederacy and the Republic had begun.

However, a Clone Army had already been created in secret on the planet Kamino on the edge of the galaxy ten years earlier, commissioned without authorization by Master Sifo-Dyas, a former Jedi perceiving chaos in the galaxy. When it became clear the Confederacy had no intention of negotiating, the Republic quickly accepted the Army made for them, and it was dubbed the Grand Army of the Republic.

=== Clone Wars ===

Despite the high quality of its armaments and cloned troops, the Republic&#x27;s war effort was initially hindered because most of the major industrial companies in the galaxy had, under the aegis of the Techno Union, sided with the Confederacy. Eventually, though, the Republic became a humongous superpower not only economically but also militarily. The rapid militarization of the Republic during the Clone Wars, overseen by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, had far-reaching effects. The Confederacy won most battles in the first year of the Clone Wars. During the second and middle year of the Clone Wars however, the Republic defended itself from Separatist attacks and retaliated with its own assaults, many of which were successful. During the third and final year of the Clone Wars, the Republic won many offensive battles in the Mid Rim and pushed the Separatist forces back to the Outer Rim with its &quot;Outer Rim Sieges&quot; campaign.

=== Fall of the Republic ===
During the Clone Wars, the Senate increasingly granted enormous amounts of power to Palpatine, who was the Commander-in-Chief. Such actions were deemed justified in the name of security and were considered a perfectly reasonable way to increase the wartime government&#x27;s efficiency. Eventually, Palpatine and his office gained enough political power to equal the Senate.

Tension between Palpatine and the Jedi grew as the war progressed. Many members of the Jedi Council remained skeptical of Palpatine&#x27;s growing power. In time, the Jedi believed that Palpatine would not surrender his emergency powers, nor his position (which had long gone over-term) by the end of the war. This suspicion was also shared by some senators, including Padmé Amidala of Naboo, Bail Organa of Alderaan, and Mon Mothma of Chandrila.

After the death of Separatist leaders Count Dooku and General Grievous (the Head of State and Commander of the Separatist Army, respectively), and the discovery that Palpatine was actually Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord behind the war, the Jedi activated their contingency plans.

=== Order 66 ===
A small group of experienced Jedi led by Mace Windu attempted to arrest Palpatine for treason. Palpatine killed all but Windu with minimal effort, and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Windu appeared to have won, but was prevented from executing Palpatine by the intervention of Anakin Skywalker, at which point Palpatine killed Windu. At that moment, Skywalker took the title and name of Darth Vader, pledging himself to the dark side as a Lord of the Sith. 

Shortly afterwards, Palpatine secretly issued &quot;Order 66&quot;, compelling the Clone army to exterminate all Jedi. Because of inhibitor chips implanted inside the clones&#x27; heads, the clones were forced to kill most of the Jedi in what would later become known as the Great Jedi Purge. The Jedi Padawans remaining on Coruscant were eliminated by Darth Vader, formerly known as Anakin Skywalker, and his personal legion.

=== Galactic Empire vs. Rebel Alliance ===

Before the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Palpatine addressed the Senate. He related the story of an unsuccessful &quot;assassination attempt&quot; on his life by the Jedi. Claiming that it was a &quot;rebellion&quot; and that their next move would be to kill all the Senators, he declared the Jedi Order to be enemies of the Republic. Palpatine announced that the Galactic Republic should be reorganized into the Galactic Empire, and he should be the emperor for life. Deluded by Palpatine&#x27;s charisma and skill (and perhaps also by his considerable dark side power), the majority of the Senate cheered him on loudly in approval. The official continuation of the Galactic Republic was the Galactic Empire.

As the Clone Wars entered their final year, Palpatine&#x27;s once near-unanimous support had begun to falter. As depicted in the &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; novelization and deleted scenes from the film itself, a bloc of senators began to emerge, even before the Clone Wars end, who opposed Palpatine&#x27;s authoritarian rule and resented his treatment of the Jedi and other opponents. This bloc, originally led by influential politicians such as Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, and later by Bail&#x27;s adopted daughter Princess Leia Organa, eventually became the political voice of the emerging Rebel Alliance.

During the war, the Empire was supported by the Empire of the Zygerrians, but since they were too weak to make a minor difference, their support to the Galactic Empire is often overseen.

=== New Republic ===

The New Republic was a restoration of the Galactic Republic after the Galactic Empire was crushed following Palpatine&#x27;s death and the destruction of the second Death Star in the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. After the fall of the Emperor, remnants of the Empire were ordered to initiate &quot;Operation: Cinder&quot;, a contingency plan created by Palpatine to annihilate both its organization, its followers and its enemies as an act of punishment for failing to prevent his demise, including the planets they have controlled. The Rebels however prevented the Empire&#x27;s self-destruction in the Battle of Jakku, finally ending Palpatine&#x27;s rule over the galaxy. In 28 ABY, part of the New Republic, concerned about corruption emerging in the Senate and its unwillingness to see the First Order as a major threat, created the Resistance to fight the First Order. The New Republic is first portrayed onscreen in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), where it is depicted as the ruling government of the galaxy and primary target of the First Order, a neo-Imperialist military junta that sought to reclaim the Empire&#x27;s legacy. 30 years after the events portrayed in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the New Republic effectively collapsed when the First Order&#x27;s planet-converted superweapon, Starkiller Base, destroyed Hosnian Prime and the New Republic fleet and Senate with its phantom energy beam. In &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), after the Battle of Exegol, Rey, a reformed Ben Solo and the Resistance have successfully put an end to the First Order, the Sith Eternal, and the resurrected Palpatine, making way for the Republic to be reborn anew.

;&quot;Legends&quot;
The successor government to the Empire was explored as early as Marvel Comics&#x27; self-titled &quot;Star Wars&quot; series, which ran until 1986. The New Republic &quot;per se&quot; debuted in the 1991 &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; novel, &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, by author Timothy Zahn.

== Institutions ==
=== Senate, Chancellor and Jedi Order ===

The Republic begins as a mutual protection and economic alliance among a number of planets in the Core. Each member world or system chooses a Senator to represent them in the Galactic Senate, the main body of the legislative branch of the government. Senators are ambassadors of their homeworlds or systems. Member worlds and systems maintain their governments and societies as long as it does not defy any central and core Republican laws. There are a wide variety of different local governments along the political spectrum: from monarchies to republics to hive-like communes.

When the Republic&#x27;s power and influence expand, many new areas of the galaxy are incorporated into the Republic. The Core and Colonies are the base of the Galactic Republic. A reorganization of senatorial representation occurs 1,000 years prior to &quot;Star Wars&quot; during the Ruusan Reformation. The most common organization for these new territories is to group regions into Sectors of about 50 inhabited worlds. Each sector is represented by a Senatorial Delegation. When the number of sectors becomes too large, sectors are organized into roughly a thousand regions, each represented by one delegation to the Senate.

The Senate serves as the unicameral main body of the legislative branch, but has immense power over the entire Galactic Republic. The capital of the Republic, which contains the most political power and wealth, is Coruscant.

Inside the Senate Building, there is an area in which the Senate debates, casts votes, and makes or passes bills. It contains 1,024 floating platforms, each of which contain a senator and his or her aides. Each platform in the senate represents a &quot;sector&quot; of the galaxy. A few platforms represent individual worlds of high importance, or worlds bringing special pleas to the Senate. Some represent special interest groups such as the Trade Federation, and other companies, corporations, and industries. Each senatorial delegation has one vote.

The members of the Senate elect a Supreme Chancellor from among their ranks who serves as the Senate&#x27;s presiding officer and as the Republic&#x27;s de facto leader. The Chancellor is assisted by the Vice Chair, who is presumably elected in the same manner as the Chancellor; the same Vice Chair is present throughout the entire prequel trilogy. The Senate follows pseudo-parliamentary rules. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum was forced out of office by the Senate in a motion of no confidence, introduced by Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo, for example.

Senators receive one vote in all matters, procedural and substantive. The Chancellor is elected from within the Senate for a set term. The Senate gives the Chancellor emergency powers in times of crisis and removes him from office when necessary. The assembly is in turn divided into individual committees, each specializing in specific fields of government administration, and which were responsible for creating legislation to be reviewed by the full assembly. The Senate has some form of judicial power as well, although the Republic has a judicial branch, in which the Supreme Court was the main body.

The main functions of the Senate are to mediate disputes between members, provide for the common defense, create and pass laws into effect that would benefit most of the Republic, and regulate inter-system trade. The Jedi Order, although technically not officially part of the Republic, are considered the defenders of the general Republic. The Republic often orders the Jedi to specific areas that require assistance. In this way, they are eventually the unofficial police force of the Republic. They become representatives of the Senate as well, to some extent.

Despite the seemingly organized structure of the Republic, the waning years of the Republic are a time of corruption and great social injustice. The Senate becomes divided between those who genuinely wish to uphold the values and ideals of the Republic and those who wish to further their own goals. Following a series of weak and ineffectual Chancellors, there is a crisis involving the invasion of Naboo by the Trade Federation over a tariff passed by the Senate.

After Senator Palpatine of Naboo becomes Chancellor, he increases the power of the office, from acting as commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, or the Republic Military to the institution of his personal bodyguard organization, the Red Guard. The Office of the Supreme Chancellor is given power equaling that of the Senate. The Galactic Senate also meets less often, as the Chancellor is voted more emergency powers to act on his own during the time of crisis.

Eventually, many Outer Rim planets and companies leave the Republic due to the amount of corruption and unfair treatment to Outer Rim worlds. Together, they form a rebellion known as the Confederacy of Independent Systems, almost exclusively referred to in the films as the Separatists. Some large industrial companies, including the Trade Federation, side with the Separatists, providing them with their military and its resources.

===Galactic politicians===
Politicians include Senators, the Supreme Chancellor, the Vice Chair of the Senate, the Administrative Aide, various Representatives from systems, and to an unofficial extent, the members of the Jedi Council. Jedi Council members hold special status as they appear to have the ability to watch Senate meetings and advise such Senators on various matters. The Jedi order protects these people.

=== Military ===
While the Republic had an Army and Navy for thousands of years, after the Rusaan Reformations, the Republic does not maintain a military except for a small force known as the Judicial Forces.

=== Palpatine and the Jedi ===
The Jedi with the most authority served on the Jedi High Council, among whom Yoda and Mace Windu act as leaders at the height of the Republic. Although the Senate holds some degree of political authority over the Jedi, very little pressure was ever put on the council before Palpatine took office and demanded that Anakin Skywalker become a member of the Council in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith&quot;, despite the misgivings of the Jedi. While the Jedi Council allowed Anakin to sit among them, they did not grant him the rank of Master.

== Reception and analysis ==

The story of the Galactic Republic&#x27;s rise, fall and resurrection have been compared to those of the real-world Roman Republic and Weimar Germany. The story of its &quot;fall and redemption&quot; has also been compared to that of Anakin Skywalker.

Brake and Chase (2016) compared the hypothesized colonization of the Core Worlds by Coruscanti humans to the state of the space colonisation by humans from the Earth, which had taken its first step with NASA&#x27;s Apollo program of 1961–1972, just before George Lucas invented &quot;Star Wars&quot;. They argued that Lucas offered a solution to the Fermi paradox: indeed, most of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy was conquered/colonized and submitted to the central government of the Republic rather quickly by the expansionist humans from the Core Worlds soon after they acquired the necessary rocket technology for interstellar travel, but there are still large uncharted Unknown Regions which are simply too far from the fashionable Core Worlds to have been fully explored (as exploration of the Unknown Regions is lethally dangerous), let alone colonized. Thus, it&#x27;s possible that the Solar System is also situated &quot;in the Milky Way&#x27;s version of the Unknown Regions&quot;, and that even if there are other species in the Milky Way, which may even have established a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-like Galactic Republic or Empire, the Earth and its human civilization have so far been in uncharted and dangerous hyperspace-travel territory (from that galactic civilization&#x27;s point of view), and humans themselves are still too technologically limited to make contact with it.

Silvio (2007) posits that &quot;Star Wars&quot; films should be understood as being heavily influenced by the time in which they were created. The prequel trilogy where the Galactic Republic was first depicted was influenced by the presidency of George W. Bush, including the war on terror, the Iraq War, and the increased U.S. security apparatus with the Patriot Act. Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s line &quot;If you&#x27;re not with me, then you&#x27;re my enemy&quot; is an echo of Bush&#x27;s war on terror dichotomy that &quot;Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.&quot; George Lucas even confirmed that Padmé Amidala&#x27;s line &quot;So this is how liberty dies... to thunderous applause&quot; invokes the Bush administration&#x27;s passing of the Patriot Act and Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without public scrutiny.

<text>In prosody, alliterative verse is a form of verse that uses alliteration as the principal device to indicate the underlying metrical structure, as opposed to other devices such as rhyme. The most commonly studied traditions of alliterative verse are those found in the oldest literature of the Germanic languages, where scholars use the term &#x27;alliterative poetry&#x27; rather broadly to indicate a tradition which not only shares alliteration as its primary ornament but also certain metrical characteristics. The Old English epic &quot;Beowulf&quot;, as well as most other Old English poetry, the Old High German &quot;Muspilli&quot;, the Old Saxon &quot;Heliand&quot;, the Old Norse &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, and many Middle English poems such as &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, Layamon&#x27;s Brut and the &quot;Alliterative Morte Arthur&quot; all use alliterative verse.

While alliteration is common in many poetic traditions, it is &#x27;relatively infrequent&#x27; as a structured characteristic of poetic form. However, structural alliteration appears in a variety of poetic traditions, including Old Irish, Welsh, Somali and Mongol poetry. The extensive use of alliteration in the so-called &quot;Kalevala&quot; meter, or runic song, of the Finnic languages provides a close comparison, and may derive directly from Germanic-language alliterative verse.

Unlike in other Germanic languages, where alliterative verse has largely fallen out of use (except for deliberate revivals, like Richard Wagner&#x27;s 19th-century German &quot;Ring&quot; Cycle), alliteration has remained a vital feature of Icelandic poetry. After the 14th Century, Icelandic alliterative poetry mostly consisted of rímur, a verse form which combines alliteration with rhyme. The most common alliterative &quot;ríma&quot; form is &quot;ferskeytt&quot;, a kind of quatrain. Examples of rimur include &quot;Disneyrímur&quot; by Þórarinn Eldjárn, &quot;Unndórs rímur&quot; by an anonymous author, and the rimur transformed to post-rock anthems by Sigur Ros. From 19th century poets like Jonas Halgrimsson to 21st-century poets like Valdimar Tómasson, alliteration has remained a prominent feature of modern Icelandic literature, though contemporary Icelandic poets vary in their adherence to traditional forms.

By the early 19th century, alliterative verse in Finnish was largely restricted to traditional, largely rural folksongs, until Elias Lönnrot and his compatriots collected them and published them as the Kalevala, which rapidly became the national epic of Finland and contributed to the Finnish independence movement. This led to poems in Kalevala meter becoming a significant element in Finnish literature and popular culture.

Alliterative verse has also been revived in Modern English. Many modern authors include alliterative verse among their compositions, including Poul Anderson, W.H. Auden, Fred Chappell, Richard Eberhart, John Heath-Stubbs, C. Day-Lewis, C. S. Lewis, Ezra Pound, John Myers Myers, Patrick Rothfuss, L. Sprague de Camp, J. R. R. Tolkien and Richard Wilbur. Modern English alliterative verse covers a wide range of styles and forms, ranging from poems in strict Old English or Old Norse meters, to highly alliterative free verse that uses strong-stress alliteration to connect adjacent phrases without strictly linking alliteration to line structure. While alliterative verse is relatively popular in the speculative fiction (specifically, the speculative poetry) community, and is regularly featured at events sponsored by the Society for Creative Anachronism, it also appears in poetry collections published by a wide range of practicing poets.

==Common Germanic origins==
The poetic forms found in the various Germanic languages are not identical, but there is still sufficient similarity to make it clear that they are closely related traditions, stemming from a common Germanic source. Knowledge about that common tradition, however, is based almost entirely on inference from later poetry.

Originally all alliterative poetry was composed and transmitted orally, and much went unrecorded. The degree to which writing may have altered this oral art form remains much in dispute. Nevertheless, there is a broad consensus among scholars that the written verse retains many (and some would argue almost all) of the features of the spoken language.

One statement we have about the nature of alliterative verse from a practicing alliterative poet is that of Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. He describes metrical patterns and poetic devices used by skaldic poets around the year 1200. Snorri&#x27;s description has served as the starting point for scholars to reconstruct alliterative meters beyond those of Old Norse.

Alliterative verse has been found in some of the earliest monuments of Germanic literature. The Golden Horns of Gallehus, discovered in Denmark and likely dating to the 4th century, bear this Runic inscription in Proto-Norse:

 x / x x x / x x / x / x x
 ek hlewagastiʀ holtijaʀ || horna tawidō
 (I, Hlewagastiʀ [son?] of Holt, made the horn.)

This inscription contains four strongly stressed syllables, the first three of which alliterate on /x/ and the last of which does not alliterate, essentially the same pattern found in much later verse.

===Formal features===
====Meter and rhythm====
The core metrical features of traditional Germanic alliterative verse are as follows; they can be seen in the Gallehus inscription above:

*A long line is divided into two &quot;half-lines&quot;. Half-lines are also known as &#x27;verses&#x27;, &#x27;hemistiches&#x27;, or &#x27;distiches&#x27;; the first is called the &#x27;a-verse&#x27; (or &#x27;on-verse&#x27;), the second the &#x27;b-verse&#x27; (or &#x27;off-verse&#x27;). The rhythm of the b-verse is generally more regular than that of the a-verse, helping listeners to perceive where the end of the line falls.
*A heavy pause, or &#x27;cæsura&#x27;, separates the verses.
*Each verse usually has two heavily stressed syllables, referred to as &#x27;lifts&#x27; or &#x27;beats&#x27; (other, less heavily stressed syllables, are called &#x27;dips&#x27;).
*The first and/or second lift in the a-verse alliterates with the first lift in the b-verse.
*The second lift in the b-verse does not alliterate with the first lifts.

Some of these fundamental rules varied in certain traditions over time. For example, in Old English alliterative verse, in some lines the second but not the first lift in the a-verse alliterated with the first lift in the b-verse, for instance line 38 of Beowulf &quot;(ne hyrde ic cymlicor ceol gegyrwan&quot;).

Unlike in post-medieval English accentual verse, in which a syllable is either stressed or unstressed, Germanic poets were sensitive to &quot;degrees&quot; of stress. These can be thought of at three levels:

# most stressed (&#x27;stress-words&#x27;): root syllables of nouns, adjectives, participles, infinitives
# less stressed (&#x27;particles&#x27;): root syllables of most finite verbs (i.e. tensed verbs) and adverbs
# even less stressed (&#x27;proclitics&#x27;): most pronouns, weakly stressed adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, parts of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, word-endings

If a half-line contains one or more stress-words, their root syllables will be the lifts. (This is the case in the Gallehus Horn inscription above, where all the lifts are nouns.) If it contains no stress-words, the root syllables of any particles will be the lift. Rarely, even a proclitic can be the lift, either because there are no more heavily stressed syllables or because it is given extra stress for some particular reason.

Lifts also have to meet an additional requirement, involving what linguists term &quot;quantity&quot;, which is related to &quot;vowel length&quot;. A syllable like the &quot;li&quot; in &quot;little&quot;, which ends in a short vowel, takes less time to say than a syllable like the &quot;ow&quot; in &quot;growing&quot;, which ends in a long vowel or a diphthong. A closed syllable, which ends with one or more consonants, like &quot;bird&quot;, takes about the same amount of time as a long vowel. In the older Germanic languages, a syllable ending with a short vowel could not be one of the three potentially alliterating lifts by itself. Instead, if a lift was occupied by word with a short root vowel followed by only one consonant followed by an unstressed vowel (i.e. &#x27;(-)CVCV(-)) these two syllables were in most circumstances counted as only one syllable. This is called resolution.

The patterns of unstressed syllables vary significantly in the alliterative traditions of different Germanic languages. The rules for these patterns remain imperfectly understood and subject to debate.

====Rules for alliteration====
Alliteration fits naturally with the prosodic patterns of early Germanic languages. Alliteration essentially involves matching the left edges of stressed syllables. Early Germanic languages share a left-prominent prosodic pattern. In other words, stress falls on the root syllable of a word, which is normally the initial syllable (except where the root is preceded by an unstressed prefix, as in past participles, for example). This means that the first sound of a word was particularly salient to listeners. Traditional Germanic verse had two particular rules about alliteration:

*All vowels alliterate with each other. The precise reasons for this are debated. The most common, but not uniformly accepted, theory for vowel-alliteration is that words beginning with vowels all actually began with a glottal stop (as is still the case in some modern Germanic languages).
*The consonant clusters &quot;st-&quot;, &quot;sp-&quot; and &quot;sc-&quot; are treated as separate sounds (so &quot;st-&quot; only alliterates with &quot;st-&quot;, not with &quot;s-&quot; or &quot;sp-&quot;).

====Diction====
The need to find an appropriate alliterating word gave certain other distinctive features to alliterative verse as well. Alliterative poets drew on a specialized vocabulary of poetic synonyms rarely used in prose texts and used standard images and metaphors called &quot;kennings&quot;.

Old Saxon and medieval English attest to the word &quot;fitt&quot; with the sense of &#x27;a section in a longer poem&#x27;, and this term is sometimes used today by scholars to refer to sections of alliterative poems.

===Relationship with &quot;Kalevala&quot; meter===
The trochaic tetrametrical meter that characterises the traditional poetry of most Finnic-language cultures, known as &quot;Kalevala&quot; meter, does not deploy alliteration with the structural regularity of Germanic-language alliterative verse, but &quot;Kalevala&quot; meter does have a very strong convention that, in each line, two lexically stressed syllables should alliterate. In view of the profound influence of the Germanic languages on other aspects of the Finnic languages and the unusualness of such regular requirements for alliteration, it has been argued that &quot;Kalevala&quot; meter borrowed both its use of alliteration and possibly other metrical features from Germanic.

===Comparison to other alliterative traditions===
Germanic alliterative verse is not the only alliterative verse tradition. It is thus worthwhile briefly to compare Germanic alliterative verse with other alliterative verse traditions, such as Somali and Mongol poetry. Like German alliterative verse, Somali alliterative verse is built around short lines (phrasal units, roughly equal in size to the Germanic half-line) whose strongest stress must alliterate with the strongest stress in another phrase. However, in traditional Somali alliterative verse, alliterating consonants are always word-initial, and the same alliterating consonant must carry through across multiple successive lines within a poem. In Mongol alliterative verse, individual lines are also phrases, with strongest stress on the first word of the phrase. Lines are grouped into pairs, often parallel in structure, which must alliterate with one another, though alliteration between the head-stress and later words in the line is also allowed, and non-identical alliteration (for example, of voiced and voiceless consonants) is also accepted. Like Germanic alliterative verse, Somali and Mongol verse both emerge from oral traditions. Mongol poetry, but not Somali poetry, resembles Germanic verse in its emphasis on heroic epic.

==Old High German and Old Saxon==
===Available texts===
The Old High German and Old Saxon corpus of &quot;Stabreim&quot; or alliterative verse is small. Fewer than 200 Old High German lines survive, in four works: the &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot;, &quot;Muspilli&quot;, the &quot;Merseburg Charms&quot; and the &quot;Wessobrunn Prayer&quot;. All four are preserved in forms that are clearly to some extent corrupt, suggesting that the scribes may themselves not have been entirely familiar with the poetic tradition.
Two Old Saxon alliterative poems survive. One is the reworking of the four gospels into the epic &quot;Heliand&quot; (nearly 6000 lines), where Jesus and his disciples are portrayed in a Saxon warrior culture. The other is the fragmentary &quot;Genesis&quot; (337 lines in 3 unconnected fragments), created as a reworking of Biblical content based on Latin sources.

In more recent times, Richard Wagner sought to evoke these old German models and what he considered a more natural and less over-civilised style by writing his &quot;Ring&quot; poems in &quot;Stabreim&quot;.

===Formal features===
Both German traditions show one common feature which is much less common elsewhere: a proliferation of unaccented syllables. Generally these are parts of speech which would naturally be unstressed — pronouns, prepositions, articles, modal auxiliaries — but in the Old Saxon works there are also adjectives and lexical verbs. The unaccented syllables typically occur before the first stress in the half-line, and most often in the b-verse.

The &quot;Hildebrandslied&quot;, lines 4–5:
The &quot;Heliand&quot;, line 3062:
&quot;Sâlig bist thu Sîmon, quað he, sunu Ionases; ni mahtes thu that selbo gehuggean&quot;
blessed are you Simon, he said, son of Jonah; for you did not see that yourself (Matthew 16, 17)

This leads to a less dense style, no doubt closer to everyday language, which has been interpreted both as a sign of decadent technique from ill-tutored poets and as an artistic innovation giving scope for additional poetic effects. Either way, it signifies a break with the strict Sievers typology.

Essentially all Old Norse poetry was written in some form of alliterative verse. It falls into two main categories: Eddaic and Skaldic poetry. Eddaic poetry was anonymous, originally orally transmitted, and mostly consisted or legends, mythological stories, wise sayings and proverbs. A majority of the Eddaic poetry appears in the Poetic Edda. Skaldic poetry was associated with individual poets or skalds, typically employed by a king or other ruler, who primarily wrote poems praising their patron or criticizing their patron&#x27;s enemies. It thus tends to be more elaborate and poetically ambitious than Eddaic poetry.

=== Formal features ===
The inherited form of alliterative verse was modified somewhat in Old Norse poetry. In Old Norse, as a result of phonetic changes from the original common Germanic language, many unstressed syllables were lost. This lent Old Norse verse a characteristic terseness; the lifts tended to be crowded together at the expense of the weak syllables. In some lines, the weak syllables have been entirely suppressed. As a result, while we still have the base pattern of paired half-lines joined by alliteration, it is very rare to have multiple-syllable dips. The following example from the &quot;Hávamál&quot; illustrates this basic pattern:
==== Meter and rhythm ====
The terseness of the Norse form may be linked to another feature of Norse poetry that differentiates it from common Germanic patterns: In Old Norse poetry, syllable count sometimes matters, and not just the number of lifts and dips. That depends upon the specific verse form used, of which Old Norse poetry had many. The base, Common Germanic alliterative meter is what Old Norse poets termed &quot;fornyrðislag&quot; (&quot;old story meter&quot;). More complex verse forms imposed an extra layer of structure in which syllable count, stress, alliteration (and sometimes, assonance and rhyme) worked together to define line or stanza structures. For example, in kvi&quot;ðuhattr (&quot;lay form&quot;)&quot;, the first half line had to contain four, and the second half-line, three syllables, while in &quot;ljóðaháttr&quot; (&quot;song&quot; or &quot;ballad&quot; meter), there were no specific syllable counts, but the lines were arranged into four-line stanzas alternating between four- and three-lift lines. More complex stanza forms imposed additional constraints. The various names of the Old Norse verse forms are given in the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson. The &quot;Háttatal&quot;, or &quot;list of verse forms&quot;, contains the names and characteristics of each of the fixed forms of Norse poetry.

==== Rules for alliteration ====
Old Norse followed the general Germanic rules for alliteration, but imposed specific alliteration patterns on specific verse forms, and sometimes rules for assonance and internal rhyme. For example, &quot;drottkvætt&quot; (&quot;courtly meter&quot;) not only required alliteration between adjacent half-lines, but imposed requirements for consonance and internal rhyme at specific points in each stanza.

==== Diction ====
Old Norse was rich in poetic synonyms and kennings, where it closely resembled Old English. Norse poets were sometimes described as creating &quot;riddling&quot; kennings whose meaning was not necessarily self-evident to the audience, perhaps reflecting competition among skalds.

===Example===
The following poem from Egil&#x27;s Saga illustrates the basic principles of Old Norse alliterative verse. For convenience, the &#x27;b&#x27; verses (the lines containing the critical last alliteration in the line, or &quot;headstave&quot;) are indented and alliterating consonants are bolded and underlined.
Further details about Old Norse versification can be found in the companion article, Old Norse Poetry.

===Icelandic===
Icelandic is not only descended from Old Norse, it is so conservative that Old Norse literature is still read in Iceland. Traditional Icelandic poetry, however, follows somewhat different rules than Old Norse, both for rhythm and alliteration. The following brief description captures the basic rules of modern Icelandic alliterative verse, which was the dominant form of Icelandic poetry until recent decades, and is still a living cultural tradition.

==== Formal features ====

==== Meter, rhythm, and alliteration ====
Icelandic alliterative verse contains lines that typically contain eight to ten syllables. They are traditionally analyzed into feet, one per stress, with typically falling rhythm. The first foot in a line is considered a &quot;heavy foot&quot;, the second, a light foot, and so on, with the third and fifth foot counting as heavy, and the second and fourth as light. Icelandic lines are basically Germanic half-lines; they come in pairs. The &quot;head-stave&quot; is the first stressed syllable in the second line in each pair, which must alliterate with at least one stress in the preceding line. The alliterating stresses in the first line in each pair are called props, or &quot;studlar&quot;, following the usual Germanic rules about which consonants alliterate. They are subject to the following rules:

* at least one prop must stand in a heavy foot
* if both props are in heavy feet, no more than one light foot can separate them.
* A prop can only appear in a light foot if it is immediately adjacent to a prop in a heavy foot.
* If the second prop appears in a light foot, only one foot can separate it from the head-stave in the next line
* If the second prop appears in a heavy foot, one or two feet can separate it from the head-stave in the next line.

This system allows considerable rhythmic flexibility.

Icelandic keeps some Old Norse forms, such as &quot;fornyrðislag, ljóðaháttur&quot;, and &quot;dróttkvætt.&quot; It also has a wide variety of stanzaic forms that combine the alliterative structure described above with rhyme (rimur), including quatrain structures like &quot;ferskeytla&quot; that rhyme ABAB, couplet structures (&quot;stafhenduætt&quot;), tercet structures like &quot;baksneidd braghenda&quot;, and longer patterns, in which rhyming and alliteration patterns run either in parallel or in counterpoint.

==== Diction ====
Traditional poetic synonyms and kennings persisted in Icelandic rimur as late as the 18th Century, but were criticized by modernizing poets such as Jonas Hallgrimsson, and dropped out of later usage.

==== Example ====
The following poem in &quot;kviðuhattr&quot; meter by Jónas Hallgrímsson with translation by Dick Ringler illustrates how the rules for Icelandic alliterative verse work. For convenience, lines starting with a head stave are indented and both props and headstave are bolded and underlined.
==== Recent developments ====
Alliterative verse appears to have been the dominant poetic tradition in Iceland until well after World War II. In the last generation, or so, a split appears to have developed between avant garde and traditionalist approaches to Icelandic poetry, with alliteration remaining frequent in all forms of Icelandic poetry, but playing a structural, defining role only in more traditional forms.

== Old English ==
Old English classical poetry, epitomised by &quot;Beowulf&quot;, follows the rules of traditional Germanic poetry outlined above, and is indeed a major source for reconstructing them. J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s essay &quot;On Translating &quot;Beowulf&quot; analyses the rules as used in the poem. Old English poetry, even after the introduction of Christianity, was uniformly written in alliterative verse, and much of the literature written in Old English, such as the Dream of the Rood, is explicitly Christian, though poems like Beowulf demonstrate continuing cultural memory for the pagan past. Alliterative verse was so strongly entrenched in Old English society that English monks, writing in Latin, would sometimes create Latin approximations to alliterative verse.

===Types of Old English alliterative verse===
Old English alliterative verse comes in a variety of forms. It includes heroic poetry like Beowulf, The Battle of Brunanburh, or The Battle of Maldon; elegiac or &quot;wisdom&quot; Poetry like The Ruin or The Wanderer, riddles, translations of classical and Latin poetry, saints&#x27; lives, poetic Biblical paraphrases, original Christian poems, charms, mnemonic poems used to memorize information, and the like.

===Formal features===
====Meter and rhythm====
As described above for the Germanic tradition as a whole, each line of poetry in Old English consists of two half-lines or verses with a pause or &quot;caesura&quot; in the middle of the line. Each half-line usually has two accented syllables, although the first may only have one. The following example from the poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, spoken by the warrior Beorhtwold, shows the usual pattern:

Note the single alliteration per half-line in the third line. Clear indications of Modern English meanings can be heard in the original, using phonetic approximations of the Old English sound-letter system:
:High [courage] shall the harder, heart the keener,
:mood shall the more, as our main [might] littleth
:here lies our elder &quot; all for-heaved&quot;

Single &#x27;half-lines&#x27; are sometimes found in Old English verse; scholars debate how far these were a characteristic of Old English poetic tradition and how far they arise from defective copying of poems by scribes.

====Rules for alliteration====
Old English follows the general rules for Germanic alliteration. The first stressed syllable of the off-verse, or second half-line, usually alliterates with one or both of the stressed syllables of the on-verse, or first half-line. The second stressed syllable of the off-verse does not usually alliterate with the others. Note that Old English only requires one alliteration in each half-line, unlike Middle English, which normally requires both lifts in the on-verse to be alliterated.

====Diction====
Old English was rich in poetic synonyms and kennings. For instance, the Old English poet could deploy a wide array of synonyms and kennings to refer to the sea: &quot;sæ, mere, deop wæter, seat wæter, hæf, geofon, windgeard, yða ful, wæteres hrycg, garsecg, holm, wægholm, brim, sund, floð, ganotes bæð, swanrad, seglrad,&quot; among others. This ranges from synonyms surviving in English, like &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;mere&quot;, to rarer poetic words and compounds, to full-on kennings like &quot;gannet&#x27;s bath&quot;, &quot;whale-road&quot;, or &quot;seal-road&quot;.

Further details about Old English versification can be found in the companion article, Old English metre.

== Middle English &quot;alliterative revival&quot; ==
Just as rhyme was seen in some Anglo-Saxon poems (e.g. &quot;The Rhyming Poem&quot;, and, to some degree, &quot;The Proverbs of Alfred&quot;), the use of alliterative verse continued (or was revived) in Middle English, though which it was—continuation, or revival—is a matter of some debate. Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, written in about 1215, uses what seems like a loose alliterative meter in comparison with pre-Conquest alliterative verse. Starting in the mid-14th century, alliterative verse became popular in the English North, the West Midlands, and a little later in Scotland. The Pearl Poet uses a complex scheme of alliteration, rhyme, and iambic metre in his &quot;Pearl&quot;; a more conventional alliterative metre in &quot;Cleanness&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;, and alliterative verse alternating with rhymed quatrains in &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;. William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; is another important English alliterative poem; it was written between &quot;c&quot;. 1370 and 1390.

=== Historical context ===
The survival—or revival—of alliterative verse in 14th Century England makes it, like Iceland, an outlier in medieval Christian culture, which came to be dominated by Latin and Romance verse forms and literary traditions. Alliterative verse in post-Conquest England had to compete with imported, often French-derived forms in rhyming stanzas, reflecting what must have seemed like the common practice of the rest of Christendom. Despite these disadvantages, alliterative verse became the preferred English meter for historical romances, especially those concerned with the so-called Arthurian &quot;Matter of Britain&quot;, and to be a common mode for political protest, through Piers Plowman and a variety of allegories, satires, and political prophesies. However, as with Icelandic rimur, many 14th-Century poems combine alliteration with rhyming stanzas. Increasingly, however, the alliterative verse tradition was marginalized relative to other English verse traditions, most notably the metrical, rhyming tradition associated with Geoffrey Chaucer.

=== Types of Middle English alliterative verse ===
Middle English (and Scots) alliterative verse fell into several typical categories. There were the Arthurian romances, such as Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, the &quot;Alliterative Morte Arthur&quot;, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, &quot;Awyntyrs off Arthure&quot;, &quot;The Avowing of Arthur&quot;, &quot;Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle&quot;, &quot;The Knightly Tale of Gologras and Gawain&quot;, and &quot;Charlemagne and Ralph the Collier&quot;. There were accounts of warfare, like the &quot;Siege of Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Scotish Feilde&quot;. There were poems devoted to Biblical stories, Christian virtues, and religious allegory, and religious instruction, like &quot;Cleanness&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;The Three Dead Kings&quot;, &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, the York, Chester, and other municipal mystery plays, &quot;St. Erkenwald&quot;, the &quot;Pistil of Swete Susan&quot;, or &quot;Pater Noster&quot;. And there were a variety of poems falling in a space that ranged from allegory to satire to political commentary, including &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, &quot;Winnere and Wastoure&quot;, &quot;Mum and the Sothsegger,&quot; &quot;The Parlement of Three Ages&quot;, &quot;The Buke of the Howlat, Richard the Redeless&quot;, &quot;Jack Upland&quot;, &quot;Friar Daw&#x27;s Reply&quot;, &quot;Jack Uplands Rejoinder, The Blacksmiths, The Tournament of Tottenham, Sum Practysis of Medecyne&quot;, and &quot;The Tretis of the Twa Mariit Women and the Wedo&quot;.

===Formal features===
====Meter and rhythm====
The form of alliterative verse changed gradually over time. Layamon&#x27;s Brut retained many features of Old English verse, along with significant changes in meter. By the 14th Century, the Middle English alliterative long line had emerged, which was rhythmically very different from the Old English meter. In Old English, the first half-line (the on-verse, or a-verse) was not very different rhythmically from the second half-line (the off-verse, or b-verse). In Middle English, the a-verse had great rhythmic flexibility (so long as it contained two clear strong stresses), whereas the b-verse could only contain one &quot;long dip&quot; (sequence of two or more unstressed or weakly stressed syllables). These rules applied to unrhymed alliterative long lines, typical of longer alliterative poems. Rhyming alliterative poems, such as &quot;Pearl&quot; and the densely structured poem &quot;The Three Dead Kings&quot;, were generally built, like later English rhyming verse, on patterns of alternating stresses.

The following lines &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; illustrate the basic rhythmic patterns of the Middle English alliterative long line:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
&quot;A feir feld full of folk fond I þer bitwene,
Of alle maner of men, þe mene and þe riche,
Worchinge and wandringe as þe world askeþ.&quot;

In modern spelling:
&quot;A fair field full of folk found I there between,
Of all manner of men the mean and the rich,
Working and wandering as the world asketh.&quot;

In modern translation:
Among them I found a fair field full of people
All manner of men, the poor and the rich
Working and wandering as the world requires.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The &#x27;a&#x27; verses contain multiple unstressed or weakly stressed syllables before, between, and after the two main stresses. In the &#x27;b&#x27; verses, the long dip falls immediately before or after the first strong stress in that half-line.

==== Rules for alliteration ====
In the Middle-English &#x27;a&#x27;-verse, the two main stresses alliterate with one another and with the first stressed syllable in the &#x27;b&#x27;-verse. There are thus a minimum of three alliterations in the Middle English long line, a fact that is implicitly recognized by the comment made by the parson in the Parson&#x27;s Prologue in the Canterbury Tales that he did not know how to &quot;rum, ram, ruf, by letter&quot;. In the &#x27;a&#x27;-verse, additional, secondary stresses can also alliterate, as seen in the line quoted above from Piers Plowman (&#x27;a fair field full of folk&#x27;, with four alliterations in the &#x27;a&#x27;-verse), or in &quot;Sir Gawain&quot; l.2, &quot;the borgh brittened and brent&quot; with three alliterations in the &#x27;a&#x27;-verse). Only the first stress in the &#x27;b&#x27;-verse normally alliterates,in line with the general Germanic rule that the last stress in the line does not alliterate. However, in Middle English alliterative poems, the final stress occasionally alliterates with other strong stresses in the line (as in the first line of Piers Plowman: &quot;In a somer seson, whan softe was þe sonne,&quot;).

====Diction====
Middle English alliterative verse maintained a stock of poetic synonyms, many of them inherited from Old English, though it was no longer characterized by the rich use of kennings. For example, a Middle English alliterative poem could refer to men by such a variety of terms as &quot;were, churl, shalk, gome, here, rink, segge, freke, man, carman, mother&#x27;s son, heme, hind, piece, buck, bourne, groom, sire, harlot, guest, tailard, tulk, sergeant, fellow,&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;.

===Death of the alliterative tradition===

After the fifteenth century, alliterative verse became fairly uncommon; possibly the last major poem in the tradition is William Dunbar&#x27;s &quot;Tretis of the Tua Marriit Wemen and the Wedo&quot; (c. 1500). By the middle of the sixteenth century, the four-beat alliterative line had completely vanished, at least from the written tradition: the last poem using the form that has survived, &quot;Scotish Feilde&quot;, was written in or soon after 1515 for the circle of Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby in commemoration of the Battle of Flodden.

== Modern revival (alliterative verse in contemporary English) ==
The late 18th and early 19th century rediscovery of the deep past set the stage for the revival of English alliterative verse. In 1786, Sir William, in a speech to the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, demonstrated that Sanskrit, the holy language of India, was related to Latin, Greek, and most of the European languages, which must therefore all be descended from a common ancestor. Between 1780 and 1840, scholars rediscovered long-forgotten manuscripts in monasteries and private libraries, leading to the rediscovery of forgotten literatures and the worlds they were associated with—for example, Beowulf, the Poetic Edda, the Nibelungenlied, and the oral traditions compiled in the Kalevala. These discoveries had a huge impact, not only literary, but political, as the recovery of national literatures helped to support emergent nationalism, in Germany, Finland, and elsewhere. This led, in turn, to the self-conscious revival of ancient forms, most notably in William Morris&#x27; romantic fantasies and Wagner&#x27;s use of &quot;stabreim&quot;, or alliterative verse, in the libretto for his opera series, the &quot;Ring of the Nibelungs&quot;. Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; electrified a generation—including budding scholars like C. S. Lewis The romantic view of the ancient North, expressed not only by Wagner but by Morris and other English romantics, led to an increasing interest in alliterative verse.

=== Alliterative verse in modernist poetics ===
The rediscovery of alliterative verse played a role in the modernist rebellion against traditional poetic forms, most notably in Ezra Pound&#x27;s Cantos (e.g., Canto I). Multiple modernist poets experimented with alliterative verse, including W.H. Auden in &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot;, Richard Eberhart in &quot;Brotherhood of Men&quot;, and later, Richard Wilbur and Ted Hughes. However, these experiments are experiments more with the idea of alliterative verse than with traditional alliterative meters. For instance, many of the following lines from &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot; violate basic principles of alliterative meter, such as placing stress and alliteration on grammatical function words like &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;you&quot;:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Deep in my dark. the dream shines
Yes, of you you dear always;
My cause to cry, cold but my
Story still, still my music.
Mild rose the moon, moving through our
Naked nights: tonight it rains;
Black umbrellas: blossom out;
Gone the gold, my golden ball. 
&lt;/poem&gt;Richard Wilbur&#x27;s &quot;Junk&quot; comes closer to matching alliterative rhythms, but freely alliterates on the fourth stress, sometimes alliterating all four stresses in the same line (which an Old English poet would not, and a Middle English poet only rarely do), as in the poem&#x27;s opening lines:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
An axe angles from my neighbor&#x27;s ashcan;
It is hell&#x27;s handiwork, the wood not hickory.
The flow of the grain not faithfully followed.
The shivered shaft rises from a shellheap
Of plastic playthings, paper plates.
&lt;/poem&gt;In his 1978 article on the potential of alliterative meter as a form in modern English, John D. Niles characterizes these experiments as essentially one-offs, rather than as part of an ongoing tradition.

=== The Inklings as alliterative poets ===
A rather different approach to reviving alliterative verse appears in the work of the so-called Inklings, specifically, J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis. Both were medievalist scholars, and as such, were familiar with alliterative metrics. Both of them made serious attempts to use and advocate the use of traditional alliterative forms in modern English (though many of Tolkien&#x27;s alliterative poems were not published until long after his death).

==== J. R. R. Tolkien ====
J. R. R. Tolkien (1892–1973) was a scholar of Old and Middle English as well as a fantasy author and used alliterative verse extensively in both translations and original poetry; some of his poems are embedded in the text of his fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Most of his alliterative verse is in modern English, in a variety of styles. Tolkien&#x27;s longest modern English works in Old English alliterative meter are an alliterative verse play, &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot; describing the aftermath of the Battle of Maldon, published in 1953, his 2276-line &quot;The Lay of the Children of Húrin&quot; (c. 1918–1925), published in 1985, and his thousand-line fragment on the Matter of Britain, The Fall of Arthur, published in 2013. He also experimented with alliterative verse based on the Poetic Edda (e.g., the &quot;Völsungasaga&quot; and &quot;Atlakviða)&quot; in &quot;The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun&quot; (2009). His Gothic &quot;poem Bagme Bloma&quot; (&quot;Flower of the Trees&quot;) uses a trochaic metre, with irregular end-rhymes and irregular alliteration in each line; it was published in the 1936 &quot;Songs for the Philologists&quot;. He also wrote a variety of alliterative poems in Old English. A version of these appears in &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;. His alliterative verse translations of Old English and Middle English alliterative poems include some 600 lines of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, portions of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and a complete translation of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;.

Tolkien&#x27;s original alliterative verse follows the rules for Old English alliterative verse, as can be seen in the following lines from &quot;The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm&#x27;s Son&quot;:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
 To the left yonder
There&#x27;s a shade creeping, a shadow darker
than the western sky, there walking crouched!
Two now together! Troll-shapes, I guess
or hell-walkers. They&#x27;ve a halting gait,
groping groundwards with grisly arms.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==== C. S. Lewis ====

Like Tolkien, C. S. Lewis (1898–1963) taught at Oxford University, where he was Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College. He was later a full Professor at Cambridge University. He is best known for his work as a literary critic and Christian apologist, but he also wrote a variety of modern English poems in Old English alliterative meter. His alliterative poetry includes &quot;Sweet Desire&quot; and &quot;The Planets&quot; in his collected Poems and the 742-line poem &quot;The Nameless Isle&quot; in his &quot;Narrative Poems&quot;. He also wrote an article on the use of alliterative meter in modern English. Like Tolkien, his poems follow the rules of Old English alliterative verse, while maintaining modern English diction and syntax, as can be seen from lines 562-67 of &quot;The Nameless Isle&quot;:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
The marble maid, under mask of stone
shook and shuddered. As a shadow streams
Over the wheat waving, over the woman&#x27;s face
Life came lingering. Nor was it long after
Down its blue pathways, blood returning
Moved, and mounted to her maiden cheek.
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Alliterative translations of alliterative verse ===
The late twentieth and early 21st century saw multiple serious efforts by renowned poets to render prominent Old and Middle English poems in modern English alliterative verse. These include Allan Sullivan and Timothy Murphy&#x27;s translations of &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Simon Armitage&#x27;s translations of &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot; and &quot;Pear&quot;l, and Tony Harrison&#x27;s translation of the York Mystery Plays. In combination with the posthumous publication of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s alliterative poems, this has resulted in modern alliterative renderings of alliterative verse becoming much more accessible to the general public.

=== Speculative alliterative revival ===
During the latter part of the 20th and early 21st Century, alliterative verse enjoyed a revival in speculative fiction and associated social spaces, including historical reenactment, fan fiction, and related social movements. This revival was associated with the American fantasy and science fiction author Poul Anderson, who embedded alliterative verse in many of his science fiction and fantasy novels, and with younger authors like Paul Edwin Zimmer who belonged to the same social circles. Their work largely circulated in fanzines and small speculative poetry journals like Star*Line, though after the foundation of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA) in the 1960s, it found a new home in occasional verse written for SCA events, where fantasy and science fiction authors and fans were likely to rub shoulders with medievalist scholars and neopagan devotees of the old Germanic gods. Alliterative verse can be found wherever speculative fiction fans gather, including fanfiction sites and even in materials written for roleplaying games (RPGs).

=== Alliterative verse as a modern poetry genre ===
During the 21st century there has also been an increase in the number of original English poems in alliterative verse included in poetry journals and in collections published by practicing poets. This increase included the publication of a number of long poems in alliterative verse, and even children&#x27;s verse, in the form of Zach Weinersmith&#x27;s humorous alliterative epic, &quot;Bea Wolf&quot;. A recent book on the subject by Dennis Wilson Wise, Speculative Poetry and the Modern Alliterative Revival: A Critical Anthology, includes one hundred and fifty poems by fifty-five poets, more original (as opposed to translated) English alliterative verse by more poets between two covers than anything that has been published since before Gutenberg invented the printing press. The index of published authors in a website devoted to tracking modern English alliterative verse, Forgotten Ground Regained, includes more than one hundred forty individual poets, and links to works by more than one hundred and twenty five other individuals posted on blogs, social media posts, fan fiction sites, and other online channels for informal communication.

<text>Nucleocosmochronology, or nuclear cosmochronology, is a technique used to determine timescales for astrophysical objects and events based on observed ratios of radioactive heavy elements and their decay products. It is similar in many respects to radiometric dating, in which trace radioactive impurities were selectively incorporated into materials when they were formed.

To calculate the age of formation of astronomical objects, the observed ratios of abundances of heavy radioactive and stable nuclides are compared to the primordial ratios predicted by nucleosynthesis theory. Both radioactive elements and their decay products matter, and some important elements include the long-lived radioactive nuclei Th-232, U-235, and U-238, all formed by the r-process. The process has been compared to radiocarbon dating. The age of the objects are determined by placing constraints on the duration of nucleosynthesis in the galaxy.

Nucleocosmochronology has been employed to determine the age of the Sun ( billion years) and of the Galactic thin disk ( billion years), among other objects. It has also been used to estimate the age of the Milky Way itself by studying Cayrel&#x27;s Star in the Galactic halo, which due to its low metallicity, is believed to have formed early in the history of the Galaxy.

Limiting factors in its precision are the quality of observations of faint stars and the uncertainty of the primordial abundances of r-process elements.

== History ==
The first use of nuclear cosmochronology was in 1929, by Ernest Rutherford, who, shortly after the discovery that uranium has two naturally occurring radioactive isotopes with different half-lives, attempted to use the ratio to determine when the uranium had been produced. He suggested that both had been produced in equal abundances, assuming they had been produced in a single moment in time, and applied an argument based on incorrect assumptions about astrophysics to derive an incorrect age of about 6 billion years. He pioneered the idea that age could be calculated by the ratio of abundances of radioactive parent elements and their stable decay products.

According to a tribute written by colleagues, a large part of the modern science of nuclear cosmochronology grew out of work by John Reynolds and his students. 

Model-independent techniques were developed in 1970.

== Technique ==
It is necessarily to know the initial ratios by which nucleosynthesis produce radioactive parent elements in comparison to the stable elements they decay to, before decay occurs. These are the abundances which the elements would have if the radioactive parent elements were stable, and not producing daughter nuclei. The ratio of the abundance of radioactive elements to the abundance they would have if they were stable is called the remainder. Measurement of the current abundances of elements in objects, combined with nucleosynthesis theory, determines the remainders.

<text>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), formerly known as Steno-Fallot tetralogy, is a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific cardiac defects. Classically, the four defects are:

*Pulmonary stenosis, which is narrowing of the exit from the right ventricle;
* A ventricular septal defect, which is a hole allowing blood to flow between the two ventricles;
* Right ventricular hypertrophy, which is thickening of the right ventricular muscle; and
* an overriding aorta, which is where the aorta expands to allow blood from both ventricles to enter.

At birth, children may be asymptomatic or present with many severe symptoms. Later in infancy, there are typically episodes of bluish colour to the skin due to a lack of sufficient oxygenation, known as cyanosis. When affected babies cry or have a bowel movement, they may undergo a &quot;tet spell&quot; where they turn cyanotic, have difficulty breathing, become limp, and occasionally lose consciousness. Other symptoms may include a heart murmur, finger clubbing, and easy tiring upon breastfeeding.
The cause of tetralogy of Fallot is typically not known. Maternal risk factors include lifestyle-related habits (alcohol use during pregnancy, smoking, or recreational drugs), medical conditions (diabetes), infections during pregnancy (rubella), and advanced age of mother during pregnancy (35 years and older). Babies with Down syndrome and other chromosomal defects that cause congenital heart defects may also be at risk of teratology of Fallot. 

Teratology of fallot is typically treated by open heart surgery in the first year of life. The timing of surgery depends on the baby&#x27;s symptoms and size. The procedure involves increasing the size of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary arteries and repairing the ventricular septal defect. In babies who are too small, a temporary surgery may be done with plans for a second surgery when the baby is bigger. With proper care, most people who are affected live to be adults. Long-term problems may include an irregular heart rate and pulmonary regurgitation.
The prevalence is estimated to be anywhere from 0.02 to 0.04% in the general population. Though males and females were initially thought to be affected equally, more recent studies have found males to be affected more than females. It is the most common complex congenital heart defect, accounting for about 10 percent of cases. It was initially described in 1671 by Niels Steensen. A further description was published in 1888 by the French physician Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot, after whom it is named. The first total surgical repair was carried out in 1954.
== Signs and symptoms ==

Tetralogy of Fallot results in low oxygenation of blood. This is due to a mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle via the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and preferential flow of the mixed blood from both ventricles through the aorta because of the obstruction to flow through the pulmonary valve. The latter is known as a right-to-left shunt.

Infants with TOF – a cyanotic heart disease – have low blood oxygen saturation. Blood oxygenation varies greatly from one patient to another depending on the severity of the anatomic defects. Typical ranges vary from 60% to around 90%. Depending on the degree of obstruction, symptoms vary from no cyanosis or mild cyanosis to profound cyanosis at birth. If the baby is not cyanotic, then it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;pink tet&quot;. Other symptoms include a heart murmur which may range from almost imperceptible to very loud, difficulty in feeding, failure to gain weight, retarded growth and physical development, labored breathing (dyspnea) on exertion, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and polycythemia. The baby may turn blue with breastfeeding or crying.

Those born with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to experience psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in later life, potentially due to underlying genetic changes that predispose to both conditions.

=== Hypercyanotic &quot;Tet&quot; spells ===
Infants and children with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot may develop hypercyanotic, or &quot;tet,&quot; spells. Patients with prominent subvalvar muscle bundles and/or conal tissue in the right ventricular outflow tract are thought to be at higher risk for hypercyanotic spells. These are acute spells characterized by profound cyanosis, often in the setting of agitation or tachycardia, that may progress to loss of consciousness or cardiac arrest if not aborted. This may be initiated by any event – such as anxiety, pain, dehydration, or fever – that leads to an increase in dynamic muscular obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract. This in turn leads to decreased blood flow through the right ventricular outflow tract to the lungs and increased shunt of deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the left ventricle and, subsequently, to the systemic circulation. The pathophysiology of these episodes is multifactorial; increased sympathetic activation (from pain, agitation, fever, etc.) leads to increased myocardial contractility, which worsens dynamic muscular obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, and increased heart rate (tachycardia), which allows less time for right ventricular diastolic filling. Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is more likely to occur in a relatively underfilled ventricle with increased contractility of the outflow tract myocardium. A relative decrease in systemic vascular resistance, as may be observed in distributive or neurogenic shock, may also precipitate hypercyanotic spells by increasing shunt from the right ventricle to the left ventricle.

Clinically, hypercyanotic spells are characterized by a sudden, marked increase in cyanosis and may progress to syncope.

Older children will often squat instinctively during a hypercyanotic spell. This increases systemic vascular resistance and allows for a temporary reversal of the shunt. It increases pressure on the left side of the heart, decreasing the right to left shunt. The decreased shunt volume results in a decrease in deoxygenated blood flow entering the systemic circulation and an increase in deoxygenated blood flow antegrade through the obstructed right ventricular outflow tract.

== Cause ==
While the specific causes of TOF have not been fully identified, there are various environmental or genetic factors that have been associated with TOF. So far, around 20% of overall congenital heart defect cases have been due to known causes such as genetic defects and teratogens which are various factors causing embryo development abnormalities or birth defects. However, the other 80% of cases have little known about their cause.

Genetic factors linked to TOF include various gene mutations or deletions. Gene deletions associated with TOF include chromosome 22 deletion as well as DiGeorge syndrome.

Specific genes associations with TOF include:

* JAG1 codes for ligands within the Notch family of proteins and is highly expressed in the developing heart. Mutations of the JAG1 gene can lead to abnormal heart development associated with TOF.
* NKX2-5 codes for cardiac morphogenesis regulators to allow for proper heart development. Defects in this gene typically causes septal defects and has been associated with around 4% of all TOF cases.
* ZFPM2 is another cardiac regulator involved in regulation of GATA4. Mutations of the ZFPM2 gene lead to reduced GATA production and have been seen in some TOF cases.
* VEGF a well-known endothelial growth factor involved in the vascularization of the heart. Decreased VEGF expression has been shown to be a modifier of TOF.
* NOTCH1 is involved in the vascularization of tissues and is the most common site of genetic variations involved with TOF, accounting for 7% of all TOF cases.
* TBX1 expresses progenitors involved with the development of the right ventricle. Chromosome 22q11 deletions also deleting TBX1 gene have been seen in 17% TOF cases.
* FLT4 gene expression leads to Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) which helps vascularization. Mutations of this gene have been associated with TOF, accounting for 2.4% of all cases.
* FOXC2 is another gene involved in embryonic development of the cardiac system. Mutations of this gene have been shown to result in dysfunctional lymphatic syndrome and TOF.
* GATA4 aids in cardiac development by helping increase the production of cardiomyocytes. Mutations of this gene have been seen in various familial TOF cases often lasting 2-3 generations.
*FLNA is a protein coded by the gene of the same name that crosslinks actin filaments into networks in cytoplasm and helps anchor membrane proteins for the actin cytoskeleton. Mutations of this gene were seen to cause TOF in some patients.
The Environmental Factors that have been studied to potentially be associated with TOF include:

* Maternal Alcohol consumption: During embryonic development, many of the body’s processing and filtration systems are not fully developed. Fetal body is unable to process alcohol as well as adults which can lead to improper development, including cardiogenesis. While no conclusive evidence has been found between effects of alcohol consumption and TOF, maternal alcohol consumption has been seen in various patients with TOF.
*Maternal smoking: Maternal smoking has been associated with various fetal complications such as premature delivery and low birth weight which can lead to TOF. In the famous Baltimore-Washington Study, it was reported that smoking more than one pack per day while pregnant was associated with two specific cardiac deflects, both part of TOF: pulmonary stenosis and transposition with VSD.
*Maternal diabetes: Maternal diabetes, diabetes Mellitus, and gestational diabetes are well-known risk factors of fetal CHD, including TOF. Maternal diabetes has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular deformations, namely the transposition of great arteries, one of the four deformations in TOF. Studies have also looked at whether diabetes increases the risk of malformation or poor sugar regulation and have found that sugar regulation does not significantly affect cardiac malformations. Retrospective studies have shown that diabetic mothers with good glucose control still retained the elevated CHD risk.
*Rubella: Rubella is characterized as mild, contagious viral disease with often unnoticed consequences. Infection with rubella during the first trimester has been seen to cause various fetal malformations, including TOF.
*Maternal Age: Older maternal age, especially after 35 can have various pregnancy risks due to existing co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and consanguinity. These risk factors can effect fetal development and lead to various fetal conditions such as CHD (including TOF), Down Syndrome and Autism.

Embryology studies show that anterior malalignment of the aorticopulmonary septum results in the clinical combination of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, and an overriding aorta. Right ventricular hypertrophy develops progressively from resistance to blood flow through the right ventricular outflow tract.

== Pathophysiology ==

In healthy individuals, the human heart develops around the 20th day of gestation, when the outer endocardial tubes merge into a single cardiac tube. Thereafter, the cardiac tube begins to fold, developing into the atrium and ventricle. The right ventricle is dominant prior to birth, receiving 65% of the venous return to the heart, and is the main contributor of blood flow to the lower part of the body, the placenta, and the lungs. Though the exact cause of TOF is unknown, an association that has been observed is an anterior deviation of the infundibular septum that results in a misaligned VSD, with an overriding aorta causing a subsequent right ventricular obstruction.

Different factors such as pulmonary stenosis can also contribute with the right ventricular outflow obstruction. During tet spells, a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary resistance would be physiologically observed.

The main anatomic defect in TOF is the anterior deviation of the pulmonary outflow septum. This defect results in narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), override of the aorta, and a VSD.

=== Four malformations ===
&quot;Tetralogy&quot; denotes four parts, here implying the syndrome&#x27;s four anatomic defects. This is not to be confused with the similarly named teratology, a field of medicine concerned with abnormal development and congenital malformations (including tetralogy of Fallot). Below are the four heart malformations that present together in tetralogy of Fallot:



There is anatomic variation between the hearts of individuals with tetralogy of Fallot. Primarily, the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction varies between patients and generally determines clinical symptoms and disease progression.

Presumably, this arises from an unequal growth of the aorticopulmonary septum (aka pulmonary outflow septum). The aorta is too large, thus &quot;overriding,&quot; and this &quot;steals&quot; from the pulmonary artery, which is therefore stenosed. This then prevents ventricular wall closure, therefore VSD, and this increases the pressures on the right side, and so the R ventricle becomes bigger to handle the work.

=== Additional anomalies ===

In addition, tetralogy of Fallot may present with other anatomical anomalies, including:
* stenosis of the left pulmonary artery, in 40%
* a bicuspid pulmonary valve, in 60%
* right-sided aortic arch, in 25%
* coronary artery anomalies, in 10%
* a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect, in which case the syndrome is sometimes called a pentalogy of Fallot
* an atrioventricular septal defect
* partially or totally anomalous pulmonary venous return

Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (&quot;pseudotruncus arteriosus&quot;) is a severe variant in which there is complete obstruction (atresia) of the right ventricular outflow tract, causing an absence of the pulmonary trunk during embryonic development. In these individuals, blood shunts completely from the right ventricle to the left where it is pumped only through the aorta. The lungs are perfused via extensive collaterals from the systemic arteries, and sometimes also via the ductus arteriosus.

== Diagnosis ==

There are three different useful diagnostic tests used for the diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot. These include a chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. The echocardiography determines the final diagnosis and typically offers enough information for surgical treatment planning. About half of all patients are now diagnosed before they are born. Differential diagnosis is when physicians diagnose between two or more conditions for a person&#x27;s symptoms and this can include primary pulmonary causes of cyanosis, cyanotic heart lesions, pulmonary stenosis and transposed arterial trunks.

=== Chest radiograph ===
Before more sophisticated techniques became available, chest X-ray was the definitive method of diagnosis. The abnormal &quot;coeur-en-sabot&quot; (boot-like) appearance of a heart with tetralogy of Fallot is classically visible via chest X-ray, although most infants with tetralogy may not show this finding. The boot like shape is due to the right ventricular hypertrophy present in TOF. Lung fields are often dark (absence of interstitial lung markings) due to decreased pulmonary blood flow.

=== Electrocardiogram ===
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most basic procedures for assessing the heart. Tiny electrodes are applied to specific areas on the body, near the chest, arm, and neck. Lead cables connect the electrodes to an ECG machine. The heart&#x27;s electrical activity is then measured. Natural electrical impulses help maintain blood flowing properly by coordinating contractions in different areas of the heart. These impulses are recorded by an ECG, which shows how fast, the rhythm, intensity and timing of the electrical impulses as they travel through the heart.

Electrocardiography shows right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), along with right axis deviation. RVH is noted on EKG as tall R-waves in lead V1 and deep S-waves in lead V5–V6.

=== Echocardiogram ===
Congenital heart defects are now diagnosed with echocardiography, which is quick, involves no radiation, is very specific, and can be done prenatally.

Echocardiography establishes the presence of TOF by demonstrating a VSD, RVH, and aortic override. Many patients are diagnosed prenatally. Color Doppler (type of echocardiography) measures the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Additionally, close monitoring of the ductus arteriosus is done in the neonatal period to ensure that there is adequate blood flow through the pulmonary valve.

In certain cases, coronary artery anatomy cannot be clearly viewed using echocardiogram. In this case, cardiac catheterization can be done.

=== Genetics ===
From a genetics perspective, it is important to screen for DiGeorge in all babies with TOF.

== Treatment ==

=== Tet spells ===
Tet spells are defined as cyanotic spells occurring due to the obstruction right ventricular outflow. Tet spells can be triggered by various factors such as crying, progressive tachypnea, and deep breathing, with symptoms including but not limited to blue skin, nails and lips, profound crying and difficulty breathing.

Tet spells may be treated with beta-blockers such as propranolol, but acute episodes require rapid intervention with morphine or intranasal fentanyl to reduce ventilatory drive, a vasopressor such as phenylephrine, or norepinephrine to increase systemic vascular resistance, and IV fluids for volume expansion.

Oxygen (100%) may be effective in treating spells because it is a potent pulmonary vasodilator and systemic vasoconstrictor. This allows more blood flow to the lungs by decreasing shunting of deoxygenated blood from the right to left ventricle through the VSD. There are also simple procedures such as squatting and the knee chest position which increase systemic vascular resistance and decrease right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood into the systemic circulation.

If the spells are refractory to the above treatments, people are usually intubated and sedated. The treatment of last resort for tet spells is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) along with consideration of Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (BTT shunt).

=== Total surgical repair ===
Total surgical repair of TOF is a curative surgery. Different techniques can be used in performing TOF repair. One method to permit pulmonary blood flow post-birth is the stenting of the ductus arterious (DA) through the inducement of a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. This surgical approach has an 83% success rate. However, a transatrial, transpulmonary artery approach is used for most cases. The repair consists of two main steps: closure of the VSD with a patch and reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract.

This open-heart surgery is designed to relieve the right ventricular outflow tract stenosis by careful resection of muscle and to repair the VSD.The right ventricle outflow tract can be reconstructed using mainly 2 procedures: a transannular patch (TAP) or a pulmonary valve-sparing procedure (PVS). The decision on the type of the procedure depends on individual anatomy (especially the size of the pulmonary valve). PVS showed better overall survival, event-free survival and less pulmonary regurgitation at 10, 20 and 30 years after the operation.  PVS  can be performed with or without ventriculotomy. A study found similar overall and event-free survival and pulmonary regurgitation rate between patients who underwent PVS with ventriculotomy and the ones who did not.

Additional reparative or reconstructive surgery may be done on patients as required by their particular cardiac anatomy. 

Timing of surgery in asymptomatic patients is usually between the ages of two months to one year. However, in symptomatic patients showing worsening blood oxygen levels, severe tet-spells (cyanotic spells), or dependence on prostaglandins from early neonatal period (to keep the ductus arteriosus open) need to be planned fairly urgently

Potential surgical repair complications include residual ventricular septal defect, residual outflow tract obstruction, complete atrioventricular block, arrhythmias, aneurysm of right ventricular outflow patch, and pulmonary valve insufficiency. Long-term complications most commonly include pulmonary valve regurgitation, and arrhythmias. Adults with repaired TOF require lifelong surveillance to monitor for such complications, with frequency of monitoring varying according to age, diagnostic methods, and the severity of the condition. 

Total repair of tetralogy of Fallot initially carried a high mortality risk, but this risk has gone down steadily over the years. Surgery is now often carried out in infants one year of age or younger with less than 5% perioperative mortality. Post surgery, most patients enjoy an active life free of symptoms. Currently, long-term survival is close to 90%. Today the adult TOF population continues to grow and is one of the most common congenital heart defects seen in adult outpatient clinics. 

=== Palliative surgery ===
Initially surgery involved forming a side to end anastomosis between the subclavian artery and the pulmonary artery -i.e. a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt. This redirected a large portion of the partially oxygenated blood leaving the heart for the body into the lungs, increasing flow through the pulmonary circuit, and relieving symptoms. The first Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt surgery was performed on 15-month-old Eileen Saxon on November 29, 1944 with the surgery ending in momentary success. Months later Saxon experienced more symptoms, and was operated on again, shortly before her 2nd birthday. She soon after died.

The Potts shunt and the Waterston–Cooley shunt are other shunt procedures which were developed for the same purpose. These are no longer used.

Currently, palliative surgery is not normally performed on infants with TOF except for extreme cases. For example, in symptomatic infants, a two-stage repair (initial systemic to arterial shunt placement followed by total surgical repair) may be done. Potential complications include inadequate pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary artery distortion, inadequate growth of the pulmonary arteries, and acquired pulmonary atresia.

=== Approaches to surgical repair ===
After years of tetralogy of Fallot surgical repair expertise, the attention shifted to the emerging evidence that long-term pulmonary insufficiency is detrimental to right ventricular function and clinical prognosis. As a result, the hunt for surgical procedures to relieve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction while minimizing pulmonary regurgitation has intensified.

A constrained right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction with a Dacron patch matched to a nominal pulmonary annulus expansion or an annulus-sparing approach yielded primary complete repair outcomes in 94 TOF infants. The pulmonary annulus size was larger in babies treated with the latter technique, as predicted. After an average follow-up of around eight years, the first group had a higher than moderate PR, yet there was no significant difference in independence from severe PR after ten years.

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in right ventricular dilation between the two techniques. Finally, they found that reconstructing the pulmonary annulus in TOF with only a tiny transannular incision and a stiff Dacron patch to inhibit pulmonary annulus extension throughout the normal growing phase produces the same long-term benefits as preserving the full pulmonary annulus integrity.

== Complications ==

=== Short-term ===
Residual ventricular septal defects and persistent right ventricular outflow blockage are common problems in the immediate postoperative period. Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardia can occur after tetralogy repair. With broad complex tachycardia, the ECG will likely show a right bundle branch block or left bundle branch block patterns. Patients who have had their hearts repaired may experience sudden cardiac death. Risk factors for abnormal heart rhythms include:

* Age (at repair)
* Male gender
* Transient complete heart block beyond post operative day three
* QRS duration greater than 180 milliseconds

=== Long-term ===
Adult patients with congenital cardiac disease are on the rise at a rate of about 5% per year, outpacing the pediatric population. Right ventricular volume overload form pulmonary insufficiency, right ventricular aneurysm from outflow patch or ventriculotomy, distal pulmonary artery obstruction, ventricular hypertrophy, chamber enlargement, biventricular dysfunction, and aortic root dilation and insufficient are all long-term complications seen in these patients. Arrhythmia, heart failure, and complications from reoperations are the three primary causes of death in individuals with corrected tetralogy of Fallot. QRS duration greater than 180 milliseconds, older age at repair (greater than three years), significant pulmonary valve or tricuspid valve regurgitation, history of syncope, multifocal premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia are some of the factors associated with sudden death after 30 years of procedure. Pulmonary insufficiency is the most common reason for reoperation, and pulmonary valve replacement criteria have traditionally been based on the severity of the regurgitant fraction on a magnetic resonance or CT scan. Right and left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices, ejection fractions, and the existence of aneurysm generating obstructive outflow are all parameters seen in this research. Exercise intolerance, heart failure signs and symptoms, syncope, and prolonged ventricular tachycardia are all possible symptoms. A transcatheter pulmonary valve method can also be used to replace a pulmonary valve.

=== Pregnancy ===
In comparison to the general obstetric population, women who had their tetralogy of Fallot repaired completely have similar outcomes. The degree of pulmonary regurgitation with right or left ventricular dysfunction, as well as the level of pulmonary hypertension, are linked to an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Fetal death is more likely in women who have moderate right ventricular hypertension or who have undergone a palliative shunt. In comparison to 0.8% of the general population, offspring of women with tetralogy have a 3–5% chance of developing congenital cardiac disease. If the 22q11 deletion is present, there is a 50% chance of transferring the damaged chromosome, with a high risk of a congenital cardiac abnormality.

== Prognosis ==

Untreated, tetralogy of Fallot rapidly results in progressive right ventricular hypertrophy due to the increased resistance caused by narrowing of the pulmonary trunk. This progresses to heart failure which begins in the right ventricle and often leads to left heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. Mortality rate depends on the severity of the tetralogy of Fallot. If left untreated, TOF carries a 35% mortality rate in the first year of life, and a 50% mortality rate in the first three years of life. Patients with untreated TOF rarely progress to adulthood.

Patients who have undergone total surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot have improved hemodynamics and often have good to excellent cardiac function after the operation with some to no exercise intolerance (New York Heart Association Class I-II). Long-term outcome is usually excellent for most patients, however residual post-surgical defects such as pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary artery stenosis, residual VSD, right ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction may affect life expectancy and increase the need for reoperation.

Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications in patients with repaired CHD such as TOF occur earlier in life compared to healthy subjects. Chronic pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dilation and dysfunction is also common.

Within 30 years after correction, 50% of patients will require reoperation. The most common cause of reoperation is a leaky pulmonary valve (pulmonary valve insufficiency). This is usually corrected with a procedure called pulmonary valve replacement.

One common prognostic factor with TOF is the development of ischemia reperfusion injury. Insufficient myocardial protection is considered one of the main causes of death in the correction of TOF.

== Comorbidities ==

There are many comorbid conditions that can occur with TOF that may exacerbate the condition. Often, TOF can present with low birth weight and prematurity. In both of these cases, mortality and morbidity were both seen to increase. Differences in right atrial and ventricular mechanics and liver stiffness was also observed in adults with repaired TOF, as well as pulmonary atresia and persistent pulmonary stenosis. In patients with pulmonary atresia, there is complete failure of forward flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary arterial vasculature. As such, pulmonary blood flow is entirely dependent on shunting from the systemic circulation, typically through a patent ductus arteriosus. The pathophysiology of TOF together with pulmonary arteriosus is uniquely attributable to defects of the pulmonary arteries. Even after operative care, these patients remain at higher risk for pulmonary arterial stenoses and pulmonary hypertension.

Danon disease, which is a rare genetic disorder, was also observed to complicate TOF. In particular, elongation of the QRS complex and a shortened PR interval. Genetic abnormalities found in TOF may lead to the earlier diagnosis of Danon disease, helping to improve prognostic outcomes.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of tetralogy of Fallot is estimated to be 0.02–0.04%, which corresponds to approximately 200 to 400 cases per million live births. It accounts for 7–10% of all congenital heart abnormalities, making it the most common cyanotic heart defect. Although males and females were initially believed to be affected equally, more recent studies have shown TOF affects males more than females. About 1 in 100 newborns is diagnosed with a congential heart defect, of which 10% are diagnosed with TOF. Genetically, it is most commonly associated with Down syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome. Down syndrome and other chromosomal disorders are known to occur alongside congential heart defects such as TOF.

== History ==
Tetralogy of Fallot was initially described in 1671 by the Danish researcher Niels Steensen. Also referenced as Nicolaus Steno in Latin, Stensen was a pioneer in anatomy and geology, his work making significant specific contribution to the fields of cardiac anatomy and pathology. A further description was published in 1888 by the French physician Étienne-Louis Arthur Fallot, after whom it was ultimately named. In 1924, Maude Elizabeth Seymour Abbott, a pediatric cardiologist from Montreal, Canada, named it tetralogy of Fallot.

The short paper &quot;Dissection of a Monstrous Foetus in Paris&quot; in 1671 first described the conditions that would later together be known as TOF. In particular, it highlighted the unusual formation of arteries, the stenosing of the pulmonary artery, the absence of the ductus arteriosus, an overriding aorta, and fetal cardiac circulation where blood was redirected to the aorta from the pulmonary artery. Over a hundred years later in 1777, Dutch physician Eduard Sandifort reported what he referred to as &quot;the blue boy&quot; patient. This patient, who was 16 months old, was initially thought to have asthma, though an autopsy postmortem revealed a cardiac malformation with no ductus arteriosus or ligamentum arteriosum, indicating that the child may have died from TOF. Another 13-year-old patient was reported by Scottish physician William Hunter in 1782. Hunter described the patient, along with three others, as suffering from cyanosis after a posthumous examination in 1774.

Other cases, such as those presented by Pulteney (1785), Abernethy (1793), Bell (1797), Dorsey (1812), and Farre (1814) also contributed to modern understandings of TOF. The first reported case of TOF was in America at the University of Pennsylvania in 1816, with more cases being reported by Peacock (1858 and 1869), Widman (1881), and finally Fallot (1888), after whom the condition is named. Fallot was the first to elegantly describe the four key features that differentiate it from other cyanotic cardiac conditions, and was prominent in the disqualification of a patent foramen ovale as a fifth feature. Fallot initially referred to it as &quot;La maladie bleue&quot;, which is French for &quot;the blue disease&quot; or &quot;cyanose cardiaque&quot;, translating to &quot;cardiac cyanosis&quot;.

The first surgical palliation was carried out in 1944 at Johns Hopkins. The procedure was conducted by surgeon Alfred Blalock and cardiologist Helen B. Taussig, with Vivien Thomas also providing substantial contributions and listed as an assistant. This first surgery was depicted in the film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;. It was actually Helen Taussig who convinced Alfred Blalock that the shunt was going to work. 15-month-old Eileen Saxon was the first person to receive a Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt. Furthermore, the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig procedure, initially the only surgical treatment available for tetralogy of Fallot, was palliative but not curative. The first total repair of tetralogy of Fallot was done by a team led by C. Walton Lillehei at the University of Minnesota in 1954 on an 11-year-old boy. Total repair on infants has had success from 1981, with research indicating that it has a comparatively low mortality rate. Today the adult TOF population continues to grow and is one of the most common congenital heart defect seen in adult outpatient clinics.

== Related disorders ==
The following illnesses have symptoms that are comparable to tetralogy of Fallot. For a differential diagnosis, comparisons between these disorders provides valuable knowledge.

=== Atrial septal defects ===
Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are a kind of congenital heart abnormality in which a tiny opening exists between the two atria of the heart. The burden on the right side of the heart is increased as a result of these abnormalities, as is the blood flow to the lungs. This leads to excessive blood flow to the lungs and an increased workload on the right side of the heart. Another common finding associated with ASDs is right ventricular hypertrophy, also known as enlargement of the right ventricle.

=== Ventricular septal defects ===
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are a kind of congenital heart abnormality in which one of the ventricles is missing. Two atria and one big ventricle are common in infants with congenital abnormalities. Symptoms of these diseases include an unusually high rate of breathing (tachypnea), a blue hue to the skin (cyanosis), wheezing, a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia), and/or an abnormally enlarged liver, which are similar to those of other congenital heart problems (hepatomegaly). VSDs can also lead to a build-up of fluid around the heart, which can lead to congestive heart failure.

=== Atrioventricular septal defect ===
Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) is an uncommon congenital heart condition characterized by faulty development of the heart&#x27;s septa and valves. Congestive heart failure is common in infants with the entire version of the condition. Fluid builds up in other parts of the body, particularly the lungs. Breathing difficulties may result from pulmonary congestion (dyspnea).

=== Mitral valve stenosis ===
Mitral valve stenosis is an uncommon cardiac abnormality that can occur at birth (congenital) or develop later in life (acquired). The aberrant narrowing of the mitral valve&#x27;s opening characterizes this condition. There are two versions of this condition known as congenital and acquired characterized by different symptoms. Congenital Mitral valve stenosis symptoms include a wide array such as respiratory infections, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations and coughing. Acquired mitral valve stenosis symptoms also include a wide array such as consciousness losses, angina, general weakness and abdominal discomfort.

<text>A person of exceptional merit, a non-United States citizen, may be declared an honorary citizen of the United States by an Act of Congress or by a proclamation issued by the president of the United States, pursuant to authorization granted by Congress.

Eight people have been so honored, six posthumously, and two, Sir Winston Churchill and Saint Teresa of Calcutta, during their lifetimes. For Lafayette and Mother Teresa, the honor was proclaimed directly by an Act of Congress. In the other cases, an Act of Congress was passed authorizing the President to grant honorary citizenship by proclamation.
What rights and privileges honorary citizenship bestows, if any, is unclear. According to State Department documents, it does not grant eligibility for United States passports.

Despite widespread belief that Lafayette received honorary citizenship of the United States before Churchill, he did not receive honorary citizenship until 2002. Lafayette did become a natural-born citizen during his lifetime. On December 28, 1784, the Maryland General Assembly passed a resolution stating that Lafayette and his male heirs &quot;forever shall be...natural born Citizens&quot; of the state. This made him a natural-born citizen of the United States under the Articles of Confederation and as defined in Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution.

Lafayette boasted in 1792 that he had become an American citizen before the French Revolution created the concept of French citizenship. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson wrote that he would have offered to make Lafayette governor of Louisiana, had he been &quot;on the spot&quot;. In 1932, descendant René de Chambrun established his American citizenship based on the Maryland resolution, although he was probably ineligible for the distinction, as the inherited citizenship was likely only intended for direct descendants who were heir to Lafayette&#x27;s estate and title. The Board of Immigration Appeals ruled in 1955 that &quot;it is possible to argue&quot; that Lafayette and living male heirs became American citizens when the Constitution became effective on March 4, 1789, but that heirs born later were not U.S. citizens.

Honorary citizenship should not be confused with citizenship or permanent residency bestowed by a private bill. Private bills are, on rare occasions, used to provide relief to individuals, often in immigration cases, and are also passed by Congress and signed into law by the president. One such statute, granting Elián González U.S. citizenship, was suggested in 1999 but never enacted.

<text>The Symphony No. 3 in E major, Op. 55, (also Italian Sinfonia Eroica, &quot;Heroic Symphony&quot;; , ) is a symphony in four movements by Ludwig van Beethoven.

One of Beethoven&#x27;s most celebrated works, the &quot;Eroica&quot; symphony is a large-scale composition that marked the beginning of the composer&#x27;s innovative &quot;middle period&quot;.

Composed mainly in 1803–1804, the work broke boundaries in symphonic form, length, harmony, emotional and cultural content. It is widely considered a landmark in the transition between the Classical and the Romantic era. It is also often considered to be the first Romantic symphony. Beethoven first conducted a private performance on 9 June 1804, and later the first public performance on 7 April 1805.

== Instrumentation ==
Symphony No. 3 is scored for:
;Woodwinds:
:2 flutes
:2 oboes
:2 soprano clarinets in B
:2 bassoons

;Brass:
:2 trumpets in B
;Percussion

;Strings:
:violins I, II
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
== Form ==

The work is in four movements:
Depending upon the conductor&#x27;s style and observation of the exposition repeat in the first movement, the typical performance time is between 45 and 55 minutes.

=== I. Allegro con brio ===

The first movement, in time, is in sonata form, with typical performances between 12 and 18 minutes long depending on interpretation and whether the exposition repeat is played. Unlike the longer &quot;adagio&quot; introductions in Beethoven&#x27;s first two symphonies, the movement opens with two very loud E major chords, played by the whole orchestra, that establish the tonality of the movement.

The conductor Kenneth Woods has noted that the opening movement of &quot;Eroica&quot; has been inspired by and modeled on Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 39, and shares many attributes of that earlier symphony which precedes this one by a decade and a half.

==== Exposition ====
The exposition has three thematic groups with varying interpretations of functionality.

# First group (measures 3 - 44, E major)
# Second group (measures 45 - 83, B major)
# Third group (measures 84 - 155, B major)

The exposition begins with the cellos introducing the first theme. By the fifth bar of the melody (m. 7), a chromatic note (C) is introduced, thus introducing the harmonic tension of the work. The melody is finished by the first violins, with a syncopated series of Gs (which forms a tritone with C of the cellos and a diminished chord). This resolves to the dominant of the relative minor (G/C minor) before a short cadential codetta in E major. The first theme is then transferred to wind instruments, then fragmented, moving through other keys with the &quot;b&quot; motif in canon and interchanged with a hemiola in the dominant, later moving between dominant and tonic. The main theme is finally restated with full orchestra in &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; before modulating to F major and the dominant B in group 2.

The modulation to the dominant key of B appears at mm. 42–44, although it is not yet fully stabilized and entrenched. Here follows a group of three or two subjects: a lyrical downward motif (mm. 45–56) in canon between oboe, clarinet, flute, and violin; a short upward scale motif (mm. 57–64) in strings with a variation; and a section beginning with rapid downward patterns in the violins (mm. 65–82).

The third theme of the second group eventually leads to a lyrical theme (m. 83), whose second half of the theme eventually builds to a loud melody (m. 109) that draws upon the earlier downward motif (m. 113). The climactic moment of the exposition arrives when the music is interrupted by six consecutive sforzando hemiola chords (mm. 128–131). Later, and following the concluding chords of the exposition (mm. 144–148), the main theme returns in a brief codetta (m. 148) that transitions into the repeat / development.

The status of these groups is debated as to which is more important in the structure. In the traditional analysis, the three early motifs are transitional subjects to arrive at the &quot;unusually late&quot; lyrical theme. An alternative analysis holds that the second theme begins earlier at m. 45 with the downward motif. In this view, the traditional harmonic progression of the exposition ends at m. 82, with the new lyrical theme at m. 83 beginning an extension. This pattern would be consistent with that found later in the development, in which the climactic moment leads to a new lyrical theme that launches an extended section. Moreover, the downward motif theme (m. 45) is developed significantly in the next section while the lyrical theme (m. 83) does not appear. The early modulation to B had been present in early drafts of the symphony, as was the indecisive nature of the second group.

Commenters have also observed that the sonata form and orchestration transitions would be fully preserved by cutting the third group (m. 83–143). However, others have observed that form and orchestration would also be fully preserved if the second and third subjects of the second group were cut instead (mm. 57–82), consistent with the traditional analysis.

==== Development ====
The development section (m. 154), like the rest of the movement, is characterized by harmonic and rhythmic tension from dissonant chords and long passages of syncopated rhythm.

The first section of the development is based around various thematic explorations and counterpoint, including a new scalar figure in bars 165-173 and a fugato derived from the main theme of the second group (mm. 236-246). The music eventually breaks into a 32-bar passage (mm. 248–279) of sforzando chords including both 2-beat and 3-beat downward patterns, culminating in crashing dissonant forte chords (mm. 276–279). Commenters have stated that this &quot;outburst of rage ... forms the kernel of the whole movement&quot;, and Beethoven reportedly got out in his beat when conducting the orchestra in Christmas 1804, forcing the confused players to stop and go back.

Rather than leading to the recapitulation at this point, a new theme in E minor is then introduced instead (m. 284), beginning the second section of the development. This eventually leads to a near-doubling of the development&#x27;s length, in like proportion to the exposition.

At the end of the development, one horn famously appears to come in early with the main theme in E (mm. 394–395), while the strings continue playing the dominant chord. In the 19th century, this was thought to be a mistake; some conductors assumed the horn notes were written in the tenor clef (B–D–B–F) while others altered the second violin harmony to G (chord of the tonic), an error that eventually appeared in an early printed version. However, Beethoven&#x27;s secretary, Ferdinand Ries, shared this anecdote about that horn entrance:
The first rehearsal of the symphony was terrible, but the hornist did, in fact, come in on cue. I was standing next to Beethoven and, believing that he had made a wrong entrance, I said, &quot;That damned hornist! Can&#x27;t he count? It sounds frightfully wrong.&quot; I believe I was in danger of getting my ears boxed. Beethoven did not forgive me for a long time.

==== Recapitulation ====
The recapitulation starts in the tonic E♭ major as expected, but then features a sudden excursion to F major early on before eventually returning to a more typical form in the tonic. The movement concludes in a long coda with that reintroduces the new theme first presented in the development section.

=== II. Marcia funebre. Adagio assai ===
The second movement is a funeral march in the ternary form (A–B–A) that is typical of 18th-century funeral marches, albeit one that is &quot;large and amply developed&quot; and in which the principal theme has the functions of a refrain as in rondo form. However, it can also be analyzed as having five parts, a combination of ternary, rondo, and sonata form:

# Exposition (mm. 1 - 68);
# Trio in major (mm. 69 - 104), False recapitulation of march (mm. 105 - 113);
# Central section or Development (mm. 114 - 172);
# Recapitulation (mm. 173 - 208);
# Coda (mm. 209 - 247).

Musically, the thematic solemnity of the second movement has lent itself for use as a funeral march, proper. The movement is between 14 and 18 minutes long.

The opening A-section in C minor begins with the march theme in the strings, then in the winds. A second theme (m. 17) in the relative major (E) quickly returns to minor tonality, and these materials are developed throughout the rest of the section. This eventually gives way to a brief B-section in C major (m. 69) &quot;for what may be called the Trio of the March&quot;, which Beethoven unusually calls attention to by marking &quot;Maggiore&quot; (major) in the score.

At this point, the traditional &quot;bounds of ceremonial propriety&quot; would normally indicate a da capo return to the A theme. However, the first theme in C minor (m. 105) begins modulating in the sixth bar (m. 110), leading to a fugue in F minor (m. 114) based on an inversion of the original second theme. The first theme reappears briefly in G minor in the strings (m. 154), followed by a stormy development passage (&quot;a shocking fortissimo plunge&quot;). A full re-statement of the first theme in the original key then begins in the oboe (m. 173).

The coda (m. 209) begins with a marching motif in the strings that was earlier heard in the major section (at mm. 78, 100) and eventually ends with a final soft statement of the main theme (m. 238) that &quot;crumbles into short phrases interspersed with silences&quot;.

=== III. Scherzo. Allegro vivace – Trio ===
The third movement is a lively scherzo with trio in rapid time. It is between 5 and 6 minutes long.

The A theme of the outer scherzo section appears pianissimo in the dominant key of B (mm. 7, 21), then piano in the secondary dominant key of F which is when the B part of the outer scherzo is heard (m. 41). This is followed by a pianissimo restart in B (m. 73), which is when the A theme is heard again, leading to a full fortissimo statement in the tonic key of E (m. 93). Later, a downward arpeggio motif with sforzandos on the second beat is played twice in unison, first by the strings (mm. 115–119) and then by the full orchestra (mm. 123–127). This is followed by a syncopated motif characterized by descending fourths (m. 143), leading to the repeat.

The trio section features three horns, the first time this had appeared in the symphonic tradition. The scherzo is then repeated in shortened form, except that very notably the second occurrence of the downward unison motif is changed to duple time (mm. 381–384). The movement ends with a coda (m. 423) – with Beethoven marking the word in the score which was unusual for him – that quickly builds from pianissimo to fortissimo, encapsulating the pattern of the whole movement.

=== IV. Finale. Allegro molto – Poco andante – Presto ===

The fourth movement is a set of variations on a theme. It lasts between 10 and 14 minutes. The theme was previously used by Beethoven in earlier compositions and arguably forms the basis for the first three movements of the symphony as well (see Thematic Origins below), and the movement can be roughly divided into four parts:

# Introduction on bass theme (mm. 1 - 75)
# Theme and variations (mm. 76 - 380)
# Reprise of the theme (mm. 381 - 430)
# Coda (mm. 431 - 475)

While writing, Beethoven found himself having to reconcile the succession of the variations form with the processional sonata form found in the first movement. Thus, the final movement can be analyzed as a double variation form, with two themes (the bass theme and melody theme) being varied alternately with each other. Fabrizio Della Seta lays out the themes as such in the table:

The following table recounts multiple interpretations of the variations, although this list is not exhaustive:

After a short introduction on the tutti that begins with the mediant chord that transitions to the dominant seventh, the quiet theme, in E-flat major, first appears and then is subjected to a series of ten variations:
*Variation 1: The first variation repeats the theme in &quot;arco&quot; while a new accompaniment is introduced. (E-flat major)
*Variation 2: The next variation, containing a new triplet accompaniment, leads to: (E-flat major)
*Variation 3: Where a new melody is introduced while the theme is still played on the bass. A brief transitional passage leads to: (E-flat major)
*Variation 4: In C minor, a fugue that starts quietly and suspensefully on the strings as it builds up to a dramatic and urgent climax. (See Beethoven and C minor.)
*Variation 5: The playful fifth variation is in D major, involving a statement of the theme where the bass instruments play the first clause of the first half in a minor mode, before correcting themselves and moving to the major for the second clause. The variation also includes two virtuosic solo passages for the flute which accompany the melodic line. This directly leads to:
*Variation 6: A stormy and raging variation in G minor, reminiscent of a Romani style dance.
*Variation 7: An incomplete variation, which begins with a simple restatement of the first half of the theme in C major, before an almost immediate switch back to the minor mode in order to bring the piece into:
*Variation 8: Another fugue, now it is bright and energized, as this time it is in the tonic (E-flat major) instead of the submediant. It builds up to a climax again; the orchestra pauses on the dominant of the home key, and the theme is further developed in:
*Variation 9: At this point, the tempo slows down to Poco Andante, and the piece becomes more serene and tranquil. The theme, first stated by an oboe and then by the strings, here is contemplative and wistful, bringing a greater sense of depth to what has been heard before. During the second half, another triplet accompaniment is introduced in the higher strings, while the melodies, played by the woodwinds, are made of syncopated 16th and 8th notes. (E-flat major)
*Variation 10: The final variation, which is when the &quot;full image&quot; of &quot;The Eroica&quot; is heard. Triumphant and heroic plunges are constantly heard on the tutti, with the triplet accompaniment from the previous variation still present, as the melody from the third variation, now victorious and energized, is heard on the brass. (E-flat major)

The symphony ends with a coda, which takes image on all previous sections and variations of the movement. At the end of the coda, there is a &quot;surprise&quot;, which is when the dynamic changes from &#x27; on the flute, bassoon, and strings only to &#x27; all of a sudden by a huge crash on the whole orchestra, as the tempo abruptly changes to Presto. A flurry of sforzandos appear, and the finale ends triumphantly with three large E-flat major chords on the tutti.

== History ==
Beethoven began composing the third symphony soon after Symphony No. 2 in D major, Opus 36 and completed the composition in early 1804. The first public performance of Symphony No. 3 was on 7 April 1805 in Vienna.

There is significant evidence that the &quot;Eroica&quot;, perhaps unlike Beethoven&#x27;s other symphonies, was constructed back-to-front. The theme used in the fourth movement, including its bass line, originate from the seventh of Beethoven&#x27;s 12 Contredanses for Orchestra, WoO 14, and also from the Finale to his ballet &quot;The Creatures of Prometheus&quot;, Op. 43, both of which were composed in the winter of 1800–1801. The next year, Beethoven used the same theme as the basis for his Variations and Fugue for Piano in E♭ Major, Op. 35, now commonly known as the &quot;Eroica&quot; Variations due to the theme&#x27;s re-use in the symphony. It is the only theme that Beethoven used for so many separate works in his lifetime, and each use is in the same key of E major.

The &quot;Wielhorsky Sketchbook&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s principal sketchbook for 1802, contains a two-page movement plan in E major that directly follows the sketches for the Opus 35 Variations, which has been identified as being intended for the Third Symphony. While the movement plan gives no explicit indication regarding the finale, Lewis Lockwood argues that &quot;there cannot be any doubt that Beethoven intended from the start&quot; to use the same theme (and bass of the theme) that he had just fleshed out in the Opus 35 Variations. Thus, it is argued that Beethoven&#x27;s initial conception for a complete symphony in E – including its first three movements – emerged directly from the Op. 35 Variations.

The first movement&#x27;s main theme (mm. 3–6) has thus been traced back to the bass line theme of the Opus 35 variations (E, B↓, B↑, E) by way of intermediate versions found in one of Beethoven&#x27;s sketchbooks. In the second movement, the combined tonality (melody and bass) of the Opus 35 theme&#x27;s first four bars – E, B↓, B7(A)↑, E – appears in slightly altered form as the funeral&#x27;s march&#x27;s second theme (E, B↓, A↑, E) (mvt. II, mm. 17–20), followed by two sudden forte Bs that echo later elements of the theme. That same tonality then appears unaltered as the scherzo&#x27;s main theme (mvt. III, mm. 93–100).

Thus, the first three movements can be viewed as symphonic-length &quot;variations&quot; on the Opus 35 theme, ultimately anticipating the theme&#x27;s appearance in the fourth movement. Moreover, Beethoven&#x27;s choice to begin the symphony with a theme adapted from the bass line is also paralleled in the fourth movement, in which the bass theme is heard as the first variation before the main theme ultimately appears. This again parallels the structure of the Opus 35 variations themselves. Finally, the loud E chord that begins the Opus 35 variations themselves is moved here to the beginning of the first movement, in the form of the two chords that introduce the first movement.

Alternatively, the first movement&#x27;s resemblance to the overture to the comic opera &quot;Bastien und Bastienne&quot; (1768), composed by twelve-year-old W. A. Mozart, has been noted. It was unlikely that Beethoven knew of that unpublished composition. A possible explanation is that Mozart and Beethoven each coincidentally heard and learned the theme from elsewhere.

=== Dedication ===
Beethoven originally dedicated the third symphony to Napoleon Bonaparte, who he believed embodied the democratic and anti-monarchical ideals of the French Revolution. In the autumn of 1804, Beethoven withdrew his dedication of the third symphony to Napoleon, lest it cost him the composer&#x27;s fee paid him by a noble patron; so, Beethoven re-dedicated his third symphony to Prince Joseph Franz Maximilian Lobkowitz – nonetheless, despite such a bread-and-butter consideration, the politically idealistic Beethoven titled the work &quot;Bonaparte&quot;. Later, about the composer&#x27;s response to Napoleon having proclaimed himself Emperor of the French (14 May 1804), Beethoven&#x27;s secretary, Ferdinand Ries said that:

In writing this symphony, Beethoven had been thinking of Bonaparte, but Bonaparte while he was First Consul. At that time Beethoven had the highest esteem for him, and compared him to the greatest consuls of Ancient Rome. Not only I, but many of Beethoven&#x27;s closer friends, saw this symphony on his table, beautifully copied in manuscript, with the word &quot;Bonaparte&quot; inscribed at the very top of the title-page and &quot;Ludwig van Beethoven&quot; at the very bottom ...

I was the first to tell him the news that Bonaparte had declared himself Emperor, whereupon he broke into a rage and exclaimed, &quot;So he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all the rights of Man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men, become a tyrant!&quot; Beethoven went to the table, seized the top of the title-page, tore it in half and threw it on the floor. The page had to be recopied, and it was only now that the symphony received the title &quot;Sinfonia eroica&quot;.

An extant copy of the score bears two scratched-out, hand-written subtitles; initially, the Italian phrase &quot;Intitolata Bonaparte&quot; (&quot;Titled Bonaparte&quot;), secondly, the German phrase &quot;Geschriben auf Bonaparte&quot; (&quot;Written for Bonaparte&quot;), four lines below the Italian subtitle. Three months after retracting his initial Napoleonic dedication of the symphony, Beethoven informed his music publisher that &quot;The title of the symphony is really &quot;Bonaparte&quot;&quot;. In 1806, the score was published under the Italian title &quot;Sinfonia Eroica ... composta per festeggiare il sovvenire di un grande Uomo&quot; (&quot;Heroic Symphony, Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man&quot;).

=== Early performances and reviews ===
Composed from the autumn of 1803 until the spring of 1804, the earliest rehearsals and performances of the third symphony were private, and took place in the Vienna palace of Beethoven&#x27;s noble patron, Prince Lobkowitz. An account record dated 9 June 1804, submitted by the prince&#x27;s Kapellmeister Anton Wranitzky, shows that the prince hired twenty-two extra musicians (including the third horn required for the &quot;Eroica&quot;) for two rehearsals of the work. The fee paid to Beethoven by Prince Lobkowitz would also have secured further private performances of the symphony that summer on his Bohemian estates, Eisenberg (Jezeří) and Raudnitz (Roudnice). The first public performance was on 7 April 1805, at the Theater an der Wien, Vienna; for which concert the announced (theoretical) key for the symphony was Dis (D major, 9 sharps).

Reviews of the work&#x27;s public premiere (on 7 April 1805) were decidedly mixed. The concert also included the premiere of a Symphony in E flat major by Anton Eberl (1765–1807) that received better reviews than Beethoven&#x27;s symphony. One correspondent describes the first reactions to the &quot;Eroica&quot;:

Musical connoisseurs and amateurs were divided into several parties. One group, Beethoven&#x27;s very special friends, maintains that precisely this symphony is a masterpiece... The other group utterly denies this work any artistic value ... [t]hrough strange modulations and violent transitions ... with abundant scratchings in the bass, with three horns and so forth, a true if not desirable originality can indeed be gained without much effort. ...The third, very small group stands in the middle; they admit that the symphony contains many beautiful qualities, but admit that the context often seems completely disjointed, and that the endless duration ... exhausts even connoisseurs, becoming unbearable to the mere amateur. To the public the symphony was too difficult, too long ... Beethoven, on the other hand, did not find the applause to be sufficiently outstanding.

One reviewer at the premiere wrote that &quot;this new work of B. has great and daring ideas, and ... great power in the way it is worked out; but the symphony would improve immeasurably if B. could bring himself to shorten it, and to bring more light, clarity, and unity to the whole.&quot; Another said that the symphony was &quot;for the most part so shrill and complicated that only those who worship the failings and merits of this composer with equal fire, which at times borders on the ridiculous, could find pleasure in it&quot;. But a reviewer just two years later described the &quot;Eroica&quot; simply as &quot;the greatest, most original, most artistic and, at the same time, most interesting of all symphonies&quot;.

The finale in particular came in for criticism that it did not live up to the promise of the earlier movements. An early reviewer found that &quot;[t]he finale has much value, which I am far from denying it; however, it cannot very well escape from the charge of great bizarrerie.&quot; Another agreed that &quot;[t]he finale pleased less, and that &quot;the artist often wanted only to play games with the audience without taking its enjoyment into account simply in order to unloose a strange mood and, at the same time, to let his originality sparkle thereby&quot;. An exhaustive review of the work in a leading music journal made an observation that may still be familiar to first-time listeners: &quot;this finale is long, very long; contrived, very contrived; indeed, several of [its] merits lie somewhat hidden. They presuppose a great deal if they are to be discovered and enjoyed, as they must be, in the very moment of their appearance, and not for the first time on paper afterwards.&quot; A review of an 1827 performance in London wrote that this particular performance &quot;most properly ended with the funeral march, omitting the other parts, which are entirely inconsistent with the avowed design of the composition&quot;.

The symphony premiered in London on 26 March 1807 at the Covent Garden Theatre and in Boston on 17 April 1810 by the newly founded Boston Philharmonic Society, both performances receiving fairly mixed reviews.

=== Manuscripts and editions ===
The original autograph manuscript does not survive. A copy of the score with Beethoven&#x27;s handwritten notes and remarks, including the famous scratched-out dedication to Napoleon on the cover page, is housed in the library of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. A first published edition (1806) of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Eroica&quot; is on display at the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague.

Several modern scholarly editions have appeared in recent decades, including those edited by Jonathan Del Mar (published by Bärenreiter), Peter Hauschild (Breitkopf &amp; Härtel), and Bathia Churgin (Henle).

== Assessment ==
=== Significance ===
The work is a milestone work in classical music; it is twice as long as the symphonies of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart – the first movement is almost as long as a Classical symphony (with repetition of the exposition). Thematically, it covers more emotional ground than Beethoven&#x27;s earlier symphonies, and thus marks a key milestone in the transition between Classicism and Romanticism that would define Western art music in the early decades of the nineteenth century.

The second movement especially displays a great emotional range, from the misery of the funeral march theme, to the relative solace of happier, major-key episodes. The finale displays a similar emotional range, and is given a thematic importance then unheard of. In earlier symphonies, the finale was a quick and breezy conclusion; here, the finale is a lengthy set of variations and a fugue.

=== Critical opinions and phrases ===
* Hector Berlioz discussed Beethoven&#x27;s use of the horn and the oboe, in the &quot;Treatise on Instrumentation and Orchestration&quot; (1844, 1855).
* J. W. N. Sullivan said that the first movement expresses Beethoven&#x27;s courage in confronting deafness; the second movement, slow and dirge-like, communicates his despair; the third movement, the scherzo, is an &quot;indomitable uprising of creative energy&quot;; and the fourth movement is an exuberant outpouring of energy.
* Richard Strauss presents themes similar to the funeral march, in &quot;Metamorphosen, Study for 23 Solo Strings&quot; (1945). Some academics say the &#x27;In Memoriam&#x27; sub-title refers to Beethoven.
* Leonard Bernstein said the first two movements are &quot;perhaps the greatest two movements in all symphonic music&quot;, in the recording &quot;Eroica&quot; (1953) and book &quot;The Infinite Variety of Music&quot; (1966).
* Gareth Jenkins said Beethoven was &quot;doing for music what Napoleon was doing for society – turning tradition upside down&quot; and embodied the &quot;sense of human potential and freedom&quot; of the French Revolution, in &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Cry of Freedom&quot; (2003).
* &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; called it the greatest symphony, based on a survey of 151 conductors in 2016.
* Alex Ross said that this symphony &quot;knows which way you think the music is going and veers triumphantly in the wrong direction.&quot;

== Use as funeral music ==
The symphony&#x27;s second movement has been played as a funeral march at state funerals, memorial services, and commemorations including:

* the funeral of German composer Felix Mendelssohn, in 1847.
* the funeral of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, in 1944.
* to mourn the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1945.
* to mourn U.S. President John F. Kennedy, in 1963.
* the funeral of the 11 Israeli athletes killed at the 1972 Summer Olympics.
* Bruno Walter performed the entire symphony as the memorial concert for conductor Arturo Toscanini, in 1957.

== Cinema ==
&quot;Eroica&quot;, a film based in part on Ferdinand Ries&#x27; recollection of the symphony&#x27;s 1804 premiere, was released in 2003.

<text>Air traffic controllers (ATCs) are people responsible for the coordination of traffic in their assigned airspace. Typically stationed in air traffic control centers or control towers, they monitor the position, speed, and altitude of aircraft and communicate with the pilots via radio. In addition, controllers ensure safe distances between the different aircraft.

The profession is considered to be highly demanding and stressful due to the need for continuous decision-making and adherence to strict safety regulations. Factors such as equipment reliability, traffic volume, weather conditions, the potential consequences of making a mistake, and airspace restrictions can further influence workload and stress levels. Despite these challenges, the role offers competitive salaries and strong job security, which are often cited as key benefits.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Air traffic controlling dates to the early 1920s in the United Kingdom (UK). The first control tower was established in 1920 at Croydon Airport, but it wasn&#x27;t until the 1922 Picardie mid-air collision that air traffic control gained wider attention. Jimmy Jeffs was issued the first Air Traffic Control License. Before 1922 air traffic controllers only provided information to the pilots on the ground. In the United States (US), Archie League is regarded as the first air traffic controller and was hired by the city of St. Louis in 1929 to prevent collisions. The first ATCs used basic visual communication methods such as flags to communicate with pilots.

=== Introduction of radar and radio communication ===

In 1930 Cleveland Airport opened the first tower using two-way radio communication and in 1946 Indianapolis International Airport (then Weir-Cook airport) became the first civilian airport to have radar installed. This allowed controllers to monitor aircraft positions in real-time, even in poor visibility conditions. Together with radio communication with the pilots, this laid the foundation for Ground Control Approaches and later Instrument landing system (ILS). These innovations fundamentally changed the profession of air traffic controllers from guidance and ground controlling to actively guiding planes that are already in the air and making sure they land safely.

=== Developments until today ===
Since the introduction of radar in the 1950s, the field of air traffic control is still undergoing major innovations; Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) technology is being expanded world wide providing even more accurate position information to the controller providing them with more advanced assistance systems.

=== Future prospects ===
With new technologies such as artificial intelligence emerging, efforts to automate certain tasks of ATCs began.

The focus of the industry is on the development of assisting and predicting artificial intelligence tools as well as the automation of repetitive tasks rather than attempts to replace the controllers. There is a consensus among developers and airport operators that, in the foreseeable future, air traffic controllers will tend to be more of a system manager overseeing decisions made by automated systems and intervening to resolve unexpected situations, which is currently one of the most difficult tasks for artificial intelligence, making full replacement unlikely. One challenge with partially automated workflows is the potential for skill and knowledge disintegration due to reduced daily practice. One possible solution is the use of computer-based training or simulation technologies to maintain continuous learning and proficiency.

Another approach to modernization is the construction of fully digital remote and virtual towers that can be accessed from anywhere in the world allowing for controllers to work remotely. Developments are already advanced, with the first remote-controlled tower having opened in Sweden in 2015.

Another concern is the acceptance or willingness by the controllers to use such technology. In a study with 500 air traffic controllers Bekier et al. found that as soon as the focus of decision-making shifts away from the air traffic controller, support for the technology dramatically decreases.

== Roles ==

===Area controllers===
Area controllers (also called &quot;en route&quot; or in the US &quot;center controllers&quot;) oversee aircraft at higher altitudes, in the en-route phase of their flight surrounding busier airports and airspace. In contrast to tower controllers their job is dominated by the discovery of conflicts.Area controllers may also handle aircraft at lower altitudes as well as air traffic around small airports that do not have their own towers or approach controllers. Area controllers are responsible for specific sectors of 3D blocks of airspace with defined dimensions. Each sector is managed by at least one area controller, known as an &quot;R-side&quot; (Radar) controller that handles radio communications. During busier times of traffic, there may also be a second area controller, known as a &quot;D-side&quot; (Data), assigned to the same area in order to assist the R-side Area controller. This can be done with or without the use of radar: radar allows a sector to handle much more traffic; however, procedural control is used in many areas where traffic levels do not justify radar or the installation of radar is not feasible, such as over oceans.

Area controllers operate within area control centers, also known as centers or en-route centers. where they are controlling high-level en-route aircraft. In the United States, these facilities are specifically referred to as Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs). Area controllers can also work in terminal control centers, which control aircraft climbing from or descending to major groups of airports.

=== Aerodrome or tower ===
Aerodrome or Tower controllers control aircraft within the immediate vicinity of the airport and use visual observation from the airport tower. The tower&#x27;s airspace is often a radius around the airport, but can vary greatly in size and shape depending on traffic configuration and volume.

The tower positions are typically split into many different positions such as Flight Data/Clearance Delivery, Ground Control, and Local Control (known as Tower by the pilots); at busier facilities, a limited radar approach control position may be needed.

The roles of the positions are:
* Flight Data/Clearance Delivery: Issues IFR flight plan clearances, obtains squawk codes for VFR aircraft, helps with coordination for GC/LC, and cuts the ATIS (weather). FD/CD is commonly known in the profession as the secretary of the tower.
* Ground: Issues taxi instructions and authorizes aircraft/vehicle movements on the airport except the active runway(s); controllers are not responsible for aircraft movement on ramps or other designated non-movement areas.
* Local (Tower): Issues takeoff and landing instructions/clearances and authorizes aircraft/vehicle movements on or across runways.
* Approach: Issues instructions to aircraft who are intending to land at the airport. This involves vectoring aircraft in a safe, orderly, and expeditious manner and, if needed, stacking the aircraft at different holding altitudes.

===Civilian/military===

Civilian ATCs handle commercial and general aviation such as airliners and private jets while military controllers usually oversee airspace or airports of armed forces. Some civilian airports are part of military airports and therefore serviced by military controllers also known as joint-use. In some countries all air traffic controlling is handled by the military and all controllers are soldiers.

=== Public/private ===
Historically, controllers were civil servants in most countries. While many countries still have public ATC services countries like Canada already have implemented mixed or fully privatized models Globally, the trend toward privatization varies. While some countries have fully privatized their ATC services, others maintain public control or adopt hybrid models.

== Skills and abilities ==
In general air traffic controllers are individuals with advanced situational and spatial awareness, strong organizational and multitasking abilities, and are able to adapt well to rapidly changing conditions. They posses assertive and swift decision-making skills and the ability to maintain their composure under pressure as well as an excellent short-term memory. Communication is also a vital part of the job. Controllers are trained to focus on the exact words that pilots and other controllers speak, as a single misunderstanding can have tragic consequences, they communicate with pilots using a push-to-talk radio communication system.

Although local languages are used in ATC communications, the default language of aviation worldwide is Aviation English. Controllers who do not speak English as a first language are expected to show a certain minimum level of competency.

== Working conditions ==

===Work patterns===
Typically, controllers work for 90 to 120 minutes followed by a 30-minute break. Except at quieter airports, air traffic control operates 24/7, 365 days a year, requiring controllers to work rotating shifts that include nights, weekends, and public holidays. Shift schedules are usually set 28 days in advance. In many countries, the structure of controllers&#x27; shift patterns is regulated to allow for adequate time off. In the UK, the most common pattern is two mornings, two late afternoons, and two evenings/nights followed by a four-day break.

===Stress===
Many countries regulate work hours to ensure that controllers are able to remain focused and effective. Research has shown that after prolonged periods of continuous work for more than two hours without a break, performance can deteriorate rapidly, even at low traffic levels. Many national regulations, therefore, require breaks at least every two hours. Sylvia Noble Tesh documented the stresses and challenges faced by air traffic controllers in her 1984 study &quot;The politics of stress: the case of air traffic control.&quot; published in the International journal of health services. In a study which compared stress in the general population and in this kind of systems markedly showed more stress level for controllers. This variation can be explained, at least in part, by the characteristics of the job.

== Training and qualifications ==
=== Requirements ===
Air traffic controllers are subject to some of the strictest physical and mental health requirements for any profession, reflecting the high responsibility. In Europe and parts of Asia, controllers must hold a Class 3 medical certificate which involves evaluations of vision, hearing, physical and mental health. While in the United States there is no required certificate, candidates undergo similar assessments by the FAA, for example, air traffic controllers are required to pass a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) before being allowed to work in the profession.

Certain health conditions such as diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, and many psychiatric disorders (e.g., clinical depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, personality disorders, a history of drug abuse, etc.) may lead to automatic disqualification or require explicit testing and waivers signed by the overseeing medical authority, demonstrating that the disorder does not impact the individuals ability to do the job. Other conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), while not automatically disqualifying, are taken seriously and must be monitored by certified doctors. Controllers must take precautions to remain healthy. Additionally controllers must report all medications they are taking, even over-the-counter drugs to the responsible medical authority. In the US numerous drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are either banned or require an air traffic controller to apply for a Special Consideration Medical Certificate and undergo continuous monitoring of the underlying medical condition.

In addition effective hearing and communication skills are also required, as controllers must clearly understand and transmit information under high-stress conditions. These rigorous standards are essential to ensure that air traffic controllers can perform their duties safely and effectively.

===Education===
In the United States trainee controllers begin work in their twenties and retire in their fifties almost universally. This is due to an FAA requirement that trainees begin their training at the Academy no later than their 31st birthday, and face mandatory retirement at age 56. However, retired military air traffic controllers may qualify for appointment after reaching 31 years of age. While other countries such as the EU members have different (stricter) regulations, a similar concept is used in many countries.

Civilian Air Traffic Controllers&#x27; licensing is standardized by international agreement through the ICAO. Many countries have Air Traffic Control schools, which are often operated by the provider of air traffic services in that country or sometimes privately. These institutions provide training to individuals without any prior air traffic control experience. At the completion of academic training, the graduating student will be granted an Air Traffic Control license, which will include one or more Ratings. These are sub-qualifications denoting the air traffic control discipline or disciplines in which the person has been trained. The ICAO defines five such ratings:

* Area (procedural)
* Area Radar
* Approach (procedural)
* Approach Radar
* Aerodrome

In the United States, controllers may train in several similar specialties:

* Tower
* Ground-Controlled Approach (GCA)
* Terminal Radar Control
* En route Control (both radar and non-radar)

This phase of training takes about 3–5 months. Whenever an air traffic controller is posted to a new unit or starts work on a new sector within a particular unit, they must undergo a period of training regarding the procedures peculiar to that particular unit and/or sector. The majority of this training is done in a live position controlling real aircraft and is referred to as On the Job Training (OJT). In this phase trainees are always with a fully qualified and trained mentor or an On the Job Training Instructor (OJTI), who will also be &#x27;plugged into&#x27; the position to give guidance and is ready to immediately take over should it become necessary. The length of this phase of training usually varies between one and three years, depending on the complexity of the sector. Only once a person has passed all training stages they will be allowed to control a position alone.

<text>The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi muscle (occasionally shortened alaeque nasi muscle) is, translated from Latin, the &quot;lifter of both the upper lip and of the wing of the nose&quot;. The muscle is attached to the upper frontal process of the maxilla and inserts into the skin of the lateral part of the nostril and upper lip. At 44 characters, its name is longer than that of any other muscle.

==Overview==
Historically known as Vidar&#x27;s muscle, it dilates the nostril and elevates the upper lip, enabling one to snarl. &quot;Snore&quot; is used because it is the labial elevator closest to the nose. The levator labii superioris alaeque nasi is sometimes referred to as the &quot;angular head&quot; of the levator labii superioris muscle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artist/Anatomist1991&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="242299" wikidata="Q182895" url="?curid=242299" title="Maxilla">
<text>In vertebrates, the maxilla (: maxillae ) is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the fusion of two maxillary bones. In humans, the upper jaw includes the hard palate in the front of the mouth. The two maxillary bones are fused at the intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. This is similar to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at the mandibular symphysis. The mandible is the movable part of the jaw.

==Anatomy==

=== Structure ===
The maxilla is a paired bone - the two maxillae unite with each other at the intermaxillary suture. The maxilla consists of:
* The body of the maxilla: pyramid-shaped; has an orbital, a nasal, an infratemporal, and a facial surface; contains the maxillary sinus.
* Four processes:
** the zygomatic process
** the frontal process
** the alveolar process
** the palatine process
It has three surfaces:
* the anterior, posterior, medial
Features of the maxilla include:
* the infraorbital sulcus, canal, and foramen
* the maxillary sinus
* the incisive foramen

===Articulations===
Each maxilla articulates with nine bones: frontal, ethmoid, nasal, zygomatic, lacrimal, and palatine bones, the vomer, the inferior nasal concha, as well as the maxilla of the other side.

Sometimes it articulates with the orbital surface, and sometimes with the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid.

===Development===
The maxilla is ossified in membrane. Mall and Fawcett maintain that it is ossified from &quot;two&quot; centers only, one for the maxilla proper and one for the premaxilla.

These centers appear during the sixth week of prenatal development and unite in the beginning of the third month, but the suture between the two portions persists on the palate until nearly middle life. Mall states that the frontal process is developed from both centers.

The maxillary sinus appears as a shallow groove on the nasal surface of the bone about the fourth month of development, but does not reach its full size until after the second dentition.

The maxilla was formerly described as ossifying from six centers, viz.:
* One, the &quot;orbitonasal,&quot; forms that portion of the body of the bone which lies medial to the infraorbital canal, including the medial part of the floor of the orbit and the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
* A second, the &quot;zygomatic,&quot; gives origin to the portion which lies lateral to the infraorbital canal, including the zygomatic process.
* From a third, the &quot;palatine,&quot; is developed the palatine process posterior to the incisive canal together with the adjoining part of the nasal wall.
* A fourth, the &quot;premaxillary,&quot; forms the incisive bone which carries the incisor teeth and corresponds to the premaxilla of the lower vertebrates.
* A fifth, the &quot;nasal,&quot; gives rise to the frontal process and the portion above the canine tooth.
* And a sixth, the &quot;infravomerine,&quot; lies between the palatine and premaxillary centers and beneath the vomer; this center, together with the corresponding center of the opposite bone, separates the incisive canals from each other.

====Changes by age====
At birth the transverse and antero-posterior diameters of the bone are each greater than the vertical.

The frontal process is well-marked and the body of the bone consists of little more than the alveolar process, the teeth sockets reaching almost to the floor of the orbit.

The maxillary sinus presents the appearance of a furrow on the lateral wall of the nose. In the adult the vertical diameter is the greatest, owing to the development of the alveolar process and the increase in size of the sinus.

==Function==

The alveolar process of the maxillae holds the upper teeth, and is referred to as the maxillary arch. Each maxilla attaches laterally to the zygomatic bones (cheek bones).

Each maxilla assists in forming the boundaries of three cavities:
* the roof of the mouth
* the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity
* the wall of the orbit

Each maxilla also enters into the formation of two fossae: the infratemporal and pterygopalatine, and two fissures, the inferior orbital and pterygomaxillary.
-When the tender bones of the upper jaw and lower nostril are severely or repetitively damaged, at any age the surrounding cartilage can begin to deteriorate just as it does after death.

==Clinical significance==
A maxilla fracture is a form of facial fracture. A maxilla fracture is often the result of facial trauma such as violence, falls or automobile accidents. Maxilla fractures are classified according to the Le Fort classification.

==In other animals==
Sometimes (e.g. in bony fish), the maxilla is called &quot;upper maxilla&quot;, with the mandible being the &quot;lower maxilla&quot;. Conversely, in birds the upper jaw is often called &quot;upper mandible&quot;.

In most vertebrates, the foremost part of the upper jaw, to which the incisors are attached in mammals consists of a separate pair of bones, the premaxillae. These fuse with the maxilla proper to form the bone found in humans, and some other mammals. In bony fish, amphibians, and reptiles, both maxilla and premaxilla are relatively plate-like bones, forming only the sides of the upper jaw, and part of the face, with the premaxilla also forming the lower boundary of the nostrils. However, in mammals, the bones have curved inward, creating the palatine process and thereby also forming part of the roof of the mouth.

Birds do not have a maxilla in the strict sense; the corresponding part of their beaks (mainly consisting of the premaxilla) is called &quot;upper mandible&quot;.

Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, also lack a true maxilla. Their upper jaw is instead formed from a cartilaginous bar that is not homologous with the bone found in other vertebrates.

<doc id="242303" wikidata="Q51801" url="?curid=242303" title="Watto">
<text>Watto is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, featured in the films &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. He is computer-generated and is voiced by voice actor Andy Secombe. He is a mean-tempered, greedy Toydarian, and owner of a second-hand goods store in Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine. Among Watto&#x27;s belongings are the slaves Shmi Skywalker and her son, Anakin. He acquires them after winning a podracing bet with Gardulla the Hutt, and he puts them both to work in his store. Anakin demonstrates an incredible aptitude for equipment repair, and Watto decides to profit from it by having the boy fix various broken equipment in the store. He eventually loses Anakin in a podracing bet with Qui-Gon Jinn when he bets on a competitor, Sebulba, who is defeated by Anakin.

==Concept and creation==
George Lucas was specific with the concept art team about what features he envisioned for Watto. Design director Doug Chiang described the character&#x27;s design as &quot;this conglomeration of odd things that really didn&#x27;t fit, but that in the end gave him a very unique and powerful personality&quot;. Lucas dismissed concepts including a pudgy parrot by Terryl Whitlatch (though Whitlatch recalls one of her designs influencing the direction for the character) and a four-armed beast with a cigar by Iain Craig. Chiang repurposed the head from one of his early Neimoidian designs, featuring a hooked trunk and crooked teeth, and added hummingbird wings, meeting Lucas&#x27;s approval. Additionally, Chiang gave Watto a vest and a tool belt, only asking for webbed feet and pants. Modeling supervisor Geoff Campell was skeptical of having a chubby alien with wings, so it was imagined that the Toydarians are filled with gas, with the wings propelling them instead of supporting their weight. Animation supervisor Rob Coleman realized that the alien&#x27;s teeth would need some modification, as the craggy teeth made lip-syncing difficult. To solve the problem, Coleman broke off one of Watto&#x27;s incisors, giving him a &quot;corner-of-the-mouth&quot; vernacular. His expressions were based on video footage of voice actor Andy Secombe, photographs of Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto&#x27;s lines to a mirror. Alec Guinness performing as Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; was used as an influence in the character&#x27;s demeanor. The sound of his wings flapping is a looped recording of sound designer Ben Burtt opening and closing an umbrella.

==Appearances==
Watto first appears in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, the first title chronologically in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. He has both an ability for haggling and a resistance to the &quot;Jedi mind trick&quot;, a technique used to persuade people. He is both a junk dealer and slave owner on the planet Tatooine, possessing both Shmi Skywalker and her son Anakin. When challenged to a bet for Anakin&#x27;s freedom by Qui-Gon Jinn along with what he needs to repair his damaged ship, Watto agrees due to him refusing to take Republic change. After Anakin beats Sebulba (whom Watto bets on), a competing racer that he challenged throughout the race he participated in, he was let go. However, Watto (who believes Qui-Gon scammed him) at first considers calling off the bet, but gives in when Qui-Gon threatens to tell the Hutts of his double-crossing. Watto makes a final appearance in the sequel &quot;Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, which takes place 10 years after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. The now-adult Anakin returns to Tatooine to find his mother. Searching Mos Espa, he finds Watto sitting outside the shop at a small stall. They reunite on somewhat amicable terms and Watto tells Anakin that he sold Shmi some years ago to a moisture farmer named Cliegg Lars, who freed and married her. Watto then takes Anakin and Padmé to look through his records to find her.

Watto makes multiple further appearances in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe; one such appearance details his time on his home planet before he came to Tatooine during a war. It also tells how he sustained his broken tusk and disabled leg. He later learns his business savvy from the Jawas, native to the planet Tatooine. In the non-canonical &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book &quot;Star Wars: Visionaries&quot;, Watto is shown to have been killed by Darth Maul (whose appearance here predates the canonical revelation of his survival of the events of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;) during Maul&#x27;s process of tracking down his nemesis Obi-Wan Kenobi, to gain vengeance for his defeat during the Battle of Naboo.

His son Blatto makes an appearance in the non-canonical television special &quot;Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars&quot;.

There has been an uncommon amount of Watto merchandise made over the years since 1999. In 2019, the Watto Funko Pop was first realized at the 2019 Galactic Con as an Exclusive. Watto has also been produced as a Lego figure and featured in the Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games, in addition to numerous other appearances in the form of collectibles and other merchandising.

==Reception==
Editors for IGN ranked Watto 78th in their list of Top 100 &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters. They wrote that he was &quot;one of the most confusing scientific anomalies&quot; due to &quot;the idea that a creature so potbellied is able to stay afloat for so long&quot;. They added that he was &quot;no prince&quot; for his unscrupulous deals.
In the book &quot;The Holy Family and Its Legacy&quot;, author Albrecht Koschorke discusses the presence of &quot;The Holy Family&quot; in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, stating that while there was no &quot;solicitous guardian watching over the mother and the holy child,&quot; Watto acts in a similar position as a &quot;man who possesses patriarchal powers without being the father.&quot;

===Allegations of antisemitism and anti-Arab sentiment===
It has been suggested that the character is offensive because of his perceived similarities to a stereotypical Jew, having a large hooked nose, beady eyes, unkempt facial hair, speaking in a gravelly voice, and being portrayed as greedy and covetous. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called him &quot;the most blatant ethnic stereotype&quot; due to his hooked nose. Bruce Gottlieb of Slate magazine criticized him as well, comparing his character to the antisemitic notion that the Jewish race is &quot;behind the slave trade&quot;. Patricia J. Williams of &quot;The Nation&quot; stated that Watto was also described as a stereotype of Arabs, but that he was &quot;more comprehensively anti-Semitic—both anti-Arab and anti-Jew.&quot; She added that Watto reminded her of an &quot;anti-Semitic caricature published in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century.&quot;

Jane Prettyman of &quot;American Review&quot; noted that after leaving the theater, she heard two young boys describe him as &quot;that weird little Jew guy with wings&quot;. Prettyman described his depiction as &quot;not at all subtle&quot;, and said that &quot;it can be counted on to flush out already-formed Jew-haters among young audiences and give them permission to continue their hatred out loud.&quot; 

Others have disagreed with this interpretation. Andrew Howe states that Watto&#x27;s &quot;nose seems less a cultural referent to Shylock or Fagin than to an elephant&#x27;s trunk&quot;. Others have described Watto&#x27;s accent as Italian, and not Jewish. Andy Secombe himself, who provided the voice of Watto, when asked about the similarities between the character and Fagin, stated that Watto is not Jewish, and the accent he used for voicing the character is Italian. He also cited Michael Ripper&#x27;s performance in Hammer films as inspiration.

===Appearances in other media===
&quot;Crazy Watto&quot; is a two-minute-long fan film that made its debut on the Internet in 2000. The film is a spoof of used car deal ads shown on television, featuring Watto. He offers up for sale familiar objects such as an X-wing. The film played at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, and is a popular fan film at many science fiction conventions. The film was originally hosted by TheForce.Net, but is now part of The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards on AtomFilms.

Actor Griffin Newman portrays a version of the character as the co-host on &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show&quot;, where he is the cantankerous, somewhat prankish sidekick to Connor Ratliff’s George Lucas. Newman has performed the character onstage and over numerous streaming performances, often clad in a tight blue spandex costume.

<text>[[Mian (surname)|Mian]] Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo (; born 14 August 1939) is a Pakistani politician. Wattoo was first elected, in 1985, the Speaker of Provincial Assembly of the Punjab. Thrice elected to the same office, he secured the office of the Chief Minister of Punjab, Pakistan in 1993 on the ticket of Pakistan Muslim League (J), after a series of tug of war between the federal and provincial government Wattoo twice had to leave office between his term only to leave office permanently on 16 November 1996.

Wattoo formed the Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah) in 1995 when he parted away with his prior party (then PML), but the party-PML (Jinnah), was unable to hold significant influence in national politics.

In May 2008, Wattoo along with his associates left Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) and joined Pakistan Peoples Party and served as the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions, he also led Pakistan Peoples Party&#x27;s provisional chapter of Punjab only to witness a complete failure in Punjab in the 2013 elections. In that election cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan&#x27;s PTI had challenged Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) winning a few dozen seats.

He tendered his resignation soon after the elections, but he was asked to continue by PPP&#x27;s Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari upon recommendation of PPP&#x27;s Punjab Executive Committee.

==Political career==

Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo was first elected as Chairman District Council Okara in 1983 during the non-party elections of the Zia era with the guidance and support of late Abdul Shakoor Khan, a prolific and respectable personality of Haveli Lakha. Then in 1985, he secured the office of the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan on Pakistan Muslim League ticket. Thrice elected for the same office, he secured the office.

After a tug-of-war between Wattoo and Nawaz Sharif, the then restored (by Supreme Court) Prime Minister of Pakistan and head of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)), all assemblies were dissolved and only after a fresh election, Wattoo was elected the Chief Minister of Punjab again on PML (Junejo) ticket, ruling a coalition consisting chiefly of Pakistan People&#x27;s Party (PPP), PML (Junejo), minorities, and some independents.

It was in 1995 that Wattoo formed his own PML (Jinnah), when he parted ways with Hamid Nasir Chattha who wanted to be the president of PML (Junejo), which Wattoo was previously a part of. The differences cropped up in the same year when Wattoo was removed as the Punjab Chief Minister in the power struggle between the province (headed by PML (Junejo) and the center (headed by rival PPP), leading Arif Nakai another PML (Junejo) candidate to be the new Chief Minister.

In Summer of 1995, Wattoo&#x27;s father Mian Jahangir Ahmed Khan Wattoo died. Wattoo did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral owing to the difference in religious ideology between a father and a son. Mian Jahangir Ahmed Khan Wattoo converted to the Ahmedi sect under the influence and training of the school headmaster of their native village, Muazzam, in Fazilka, India. Wattoo, on the other hand, took his mother&#x27;s and forefather&#x27;s (except father&#x27;s) religion and is a Muslim.

Painted corrupt by the PPP and the PML-N, he was removed from the office of Chief Minister only to be restored to office a year later in 1996 by the High Court. Corruption allegations and court proceedings were started against Wattoo by arch rival and then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of the PML-N. Mian Manzoor Wattoo was sentenced by an accountability court to more than 10 years in prison besides being fined 10 million rupees, only later to be set aside in the appeals.
His daughter Rubina Shaheen Wattoo served as a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for the PML(Q). He actively began taking part in politics and soon became a close ally of Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. Having merged his political party, Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah), into the ruling PML (Q) on presidential advice, he was made the Senior Vice President of the ruling party. His relations with the party&#x27;s leadership remained sour from the beginning, who tried at marginalizing Wattoo and anyone associated with him.
Wattoo remained part of the part despite differences with the party leaders Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and the Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi who had previously suffered heavily under Wattoo&#x27;s reign in Punjab (1993–95).

Wattoo announced to join forces with the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party on 29 May 2008 along with party members in Islamabad soon after winning a decisive victory in February 2008 elections in which he won from two constituencies NA-146 and NA-147 as an independent and his daughter Rubina Shaheen Wattoo won PP-188.
Wattoo served as Federal Minister for Industries and Production in the PPP government of Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani his portfolio was changed and he became Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas.

His son, Khurram Jahangir Wattoo, who won NA-147, after his father left his home constituency, was made the Parliamentary Secretary for Establishment and Cabinet Divisions by the PPP leadership.

<text>Kogarkoite is a sodium sulfate fluoride mineral with formula Na3(SO4)F. It has a pale blue color, a specific gravity of about 2.67 and a hardness of 3.5. The crystal is monoclinic and is a type of naturally occurring antiperovskite. Kogarkoite is named after the Russian petrologist Lia Nikolaevna Kogarko (born 1936) who discovered the mineral.

==Discovery and occurrence==
Kogarkoite was first described in 1973 for an occurrence on Alluaiv Mountain, Lovozero Massif, Kola Peninsula, Russia. On Alluaiv it occurs in pegmatitic veins in nepheline syenite. It occurs with sodalite in syenite xenoliths in an alkali intrusive complex at Mont Saint-Hilaire, Canada. In Hortense Hot Spring, Chaffee County, Colorado, it occurs as a sublimate. It occurs at Lake Natron near Ol Doinyo Lengai, Tanzania and Suswa Volcano, Lake Magadi, Kenya.

<doc id="242313" wikidata="Q6232906" url="?curid=242313" title="John Fell (bishop)">
<text>John Fell (23 June 1625 – 10 July 1686) was an English churchman and influential academic. He served as Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and later concomitantly as Bishop of Oxford.

==Education==
Fell was born at Longworth, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), the eldest son of Samuel Fell and his wife, Margaret (née Wylde). Samuel Fell was also Dean of Christ Church, from 1638 until 1648. John Fell received his early education at Lord Williams&#x27;s School at Thame in Oxfordshire. In 1637 at age 11 he became a student at Christ Church, and in 1640 because of his &quot;known desert&quot;, he was specially allowed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, to proceed to his degree of BA when lacking one term&#x27;s residence. He obtained his MA in 1643 and took Holy Orders (deacon 1647, priest 1649).

==English Civil War==
During the Civil War he bore arms for King Charles I of England and held a commission as ensign. In 1648 he was deprived of his studentship by the parliamentary visitors, and during the next few years he resided chiefly at Oxford with his brother-in-law, Thomas Willis, at whose house opposite Merton College he and his friends Richard Allestree and John Dolben maintained an Anglican presence in Oxford throughout the Commonwealth.

==Career==

After the Restoration, Fell was made prebendary of Chichester, canon of Christ Church (27 July 1660), dean (30 November), master of St Oswald&#x27;s hospital, Worcester, chaplain to the king, and D.D. He filled the office of Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1666 to 1669, and was consecrated Bishop of Oxford, in 1676, retaining his deanery &quot;in commendam&quot;. Some years later, he declined the Primacy of Ireland.

Fell showed himself a capable administrator. He restored good order in the university by the archbishop, which during the Commonwealth had given place to a general disregard of authority. He ejected the intruders from his college or else &quot;fixed them in loyal principles.&quot; &quot;He was the most zealous man of his time for the Church of England,&quot; says Anthony Wood, &quot;and none that I yet know of did go beyond him in the performance of the rules belonging thereunto.&quot; He attended chapel four times a day, restored to the services, not without some opposition, the organ and surplice, and insisted on the proper academic dress which had fallen into disuse. He was active in recovering church property, and by his directions a children&#x27;s catechism was drawn up by Thomas Marshall for use in his diocese. &quot;As he was among the first of our clergy,&quot; says Thomas Burnet, &quot;that apprehended the design of bringing in popery, so he was one of the most zealous against it.&quot;

He made many converts from the Roman Catholics and Nonconformists. On the other hand, he successfully opposed the incorporation of Titus Oates as D.D. in the university in October 1679; and according to the testimony of William Nichols, his secretary, he disapproved of the Exclusion Bill. He excluded the undergraduates, whose presence had been irregularly permitted, from convocation. He obliged students to attend lectures, instituted reforms in the performances of the public exercises in the schools, kept the examiners up to their duties, was present in person at examinations. He encouraged the students to act plays. He entirely suppressed &quot;coursing,&quot; i.e. disputations in which the rival parties &quot;ran down opponents in arguments,&quot; and which commonly ended in blows and disturbances.

===Discipline===
He was a disciplinarian, and possessed a talent for the education of young men, many of whom he received into his own family. Tom Brown, author of &quot;The Dialogues of the Dead&quot;, about to be expelled from Oxford for some offence, was pardoned by Fell on the condition of his translating &quot;ex tempore&quot; the 32nd epigram of Martial:

To which he immediately replied with the well-known lines:
&lt;poem&gt;
I do not like thee, Doctor Fell,
The reason why I cannot tell;
But this I know, and know full well,
I do not like thee, Dr Fell.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Delinquents were not always treated thus mildly by Fell, and Acton Cremer, for the crime of courting a wife while only a bachelor of arts, was punished by having to translate into English the whole of Scheffer&#x27;s history of Lapland. As Vice-Chancellor, Fell personally visited the drinking taverns and ordered out the students. In the university elections he showed great energy in suppressing corruption.

===Building operations===
Fell&#x27;s building operations were ambitious. In his own college he completed in 1665 the north side of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s great quadrangle, already begun by his father but abandoned during the Commonwealth; in 1672, he rebuilt the east side of the Chaplain&#x27;s quadrangle &quot;with a straight passage under it leading from the cloister into the field,&quot; occupied now by the new Meadow Buildings; the lodgings of the canon of the third stall in the passage uniting the Tom Quad and Peckwater Quadrangle (c.1674); a long building joining the Chaplain&#x27;s quadrangle on the east side in 1677–1678; and lastly the great Tom Tower gate, begun in June 1681 on the foundation laid by Wolsey and finished in November 1682, to which the bell &quot;great Tom,&quot; after being recast, was transferred from the cathedral in 1683. In 1670 he planted and laid out the Broad Walk.

He spent large sums of his own on these works, gave £500 for the restoration of Banbury church, erected a church at St Oswald&#x27;s, Worcester, and the parsonage house at Woodstock at his own expense, and rebuilt Cuddesdon Palace. Fell disapproved of the use of the University Church of St Mary the Virgin for secular purposes, and promoted the building of the Sheldonian Theatre by Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon. He was treasurer during its construction, presided at the formal opening on 9 July 1669, and was nominated curator, along with Christopher Wren, in July 1670.

===Oxford University Press===
In the theatre was placed the Oxford University Press, the establishment of which had been a favourite project of Laud and now engaged a large share of Fell&#x27;s energy and attention, and which as curator he practically controlled. &quot;Were it not you ken Mr Dean extraordinarily well,&quot; wrote Sir Leoline Jenkins to John Williamson in 1672, &quot;it were impossible to imagine how assiduous and drudging he is about his press.&quot; He sent for type and printers from Holland, declaring that &quot;the foundation of all success must be laid in doing things well, which l am sure will not be done with English letters.&quot;

===Writings===
Many works, including a Bible, editions of the classics and of the early fathers, were produced under Fell&#x27;s direction and editing. He published annually one work, generally a classical author annotated by himself, which he distributed to all the students of his college on New Year&#x27;s Day. On one occasion he surprised the Press in surreptitiously printing Pietro Aretino&#x27;s &quot;Postures&quot;, and he seized and destroyed the plates and impressions. Ever &quot;an eager defender and maintainer of the university and its privileges,&quot; he was hostile to the Royal Society, which he regarded as a possible rival, and in 1686 he gave an absolute refusal to Obadiah Walker, afterwards the Roman Catholic master of University College, though licensed by James II, to print books, declaring he would as soon &quot;part with his bed from under him&quot; as his press. He conducted it on strict business principles, and to the criticism that more great works were not produced replied that they would not sell. He was, however, not free from fads, and his new spelling (of which one feature was the substitution of i for y in such words as &quot;eies&quot;, &quot;daies&quot;, &quot;maiest&quot;) met with great disapproval.

Fell also wrote lives of his friends Henry Hammond (1661), Richard Allestree, prefixed to his edition of the latter&#x27;s sermons (1684), and Thomas Willis, in Latin. His seasonable advice to Protestants showing the necessity of maintaining the Established Religion in opposition to Popery was published in 1688. Some of his sermons, which John Evelyn found dull, were printed, including &quot;Character of the Last Daies&quot;, preached before the king, 1675, and a sermon preached before the House of Peers on 22 December 1680. &quot;The Interest of England stated&quot; (1659), advocating the restoration of the king, and &quot;The Vanity of Scoffing&quot; (1674), are also attributed to him. Fell probably had some share in the composition of &quot;The Whole Duty of Man&quot;, and in the subsequent works published under the name of the author of &quot;The Whole Duty&quot;, which included &quot;Reasons of the Decay of Christian Piety&quot;, &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Calling&quot;, &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Calling&quot;, &quot;The Government of the Tongue&quot;, &quot;The Art of Contentment&quot;, and &quot;The Lively Oracles&quot; given us, all of which were published in one volume with notes and a preface by Fell in 1684.

===Linguist and translator===
He had a high reputation as a Grecian, a Latinist and a philologist, and he brought out with the collaboration of others his edition of St Cyprian in 1682, an English translation of &quot;The Unity of the Church&quot; in 1681, editions of Nemesius of Emesa (1671), of Aratus and of Eratosthenes (1672), Theocritus (1676), Alcinous on Plato (1677), St Clement&#x27;s &quot;Epistles to the Corinthians&quot; (1677), Athenagoras (1682), Clemens Alexandrinus (1683), Theophilus of Antioch (1684), &quot;Grammatica rationis sive institutiones logicae&quot; (1673 and 1685), and a critical edition of the New Testament in 1675. The first volumes of &quot;Rerum Anglicarum scriptores&quot; and of &quot;Historiae Britannicae&quot;, etc. were compiled under his patronage in 1684. Manuscripts of Saint Augustine were placed in the Bodleian at his behest; while other libraries at Oxford generously collated a catalogue for the use of the Benedictines at Paris, who were then preparing a new edition of the father.

===Mission to India===
Occasionally imprudent in his schemes, he was the originator of a mission to India which was taken up by the British East India Company. He undertook to train as missionaries four scholars at Oxford, procured a set of Arabic types, and issued from these the Gospels and Acts in the Malay language in 1677. This was unsuccessful, and the mission collapsed.

===Controversy===
Having undertaken at his own charge to publish a Latin version of Wood&#x27;s &quot;History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford&quot;, with the object of presenting the history of the university in a manner worthy of the great subject to European readers, and of extending its fame abroad, he arrogated to himself the right of editing the work. &quot;He would correct, alter, dash out what he pleased... He was a great man and carried all things at his pleasure.&quot; In particular he struck out all the passages which Wood had inserted in praise of Thomas Hobbes, and substituted some disparaging epithets. He called &quot;Leviathan&quot; &quot;monstrosissimus&quot; and &quot;publico damno notissimus.&quot; To the printed remonstrance of Hobbes, Fell inserted an insulting reply in the History to &quot;irritabile illud et vanissimum Malmesburiense animal,&quot; and to the complaint of Wood at this usage answered only that Hobbes &quot;was an old man, had one foot in the grave; that he should mind his latter end, and not trouble the world any more with his papers.&quot; In small things as in great he loved to rule and direct. &quot;Let not Fell,&quot; writes R. South to Ralph Bathurst, &quot;have the fingering and altering of them, for I think that, barring the want of siquidems and quinetiams, they are as good as his Worship can make.&quot; Wood styled him &quot;a valde vult person.&quot;

Not content with ruling his own college, he desired to govern the whole university. He prevented Gilbert Ironside, who &quot;was not pliable to his humour,&quot; from holding the office of Vice-Chancellor. He &quot;endeavoured to carry all things by a high hand; scorn&#x27;d in the least to court the Masters when he had to have anything pass&#x27;d the convocation. Severe to other colleges, blind as to his own, very partiall and with good words, and flatterers and tell-tales could get anything out of him.&quot; According to Bishop Gilbert Burnet, who praises his character and administration, Fell was &quot;a little too much heated in the matter of our disputes with the dissenters...He had much zeal for reforming abuses, and managed it perhaps with too much heat and in too peremptory a way...But we have so little of that among us that no wonder if such men are censured by those who love not such patterns nor such severe task-masters.&quot; And Anthony Wood, after declaring that Fell &quot;was exceeding partial in his government even to corruption; went thro&#x27; thick and thin; grasped at all yet did nothing perfect or effectually; cared not what people said of him, was in many things very rude and in most pedantic and pedagogical,&quot; concluded that he &quot;yet still aimed at the public good.&quot; Roger North, who paid Fell a visit at Oxford, wrote of him in terms of enthusiasm: &quot;The great Dr Fell, who was truly great in all his circumstances, capacities, undertakings and learning, and above all for his superabundant public spirit and goodwill ... O the felicity of that age and place when his authority swayed!&quot;

In November 1684, at the command of King Charles II, Fell deprived John Locke, who had incurred the royal displeasure by his friendship with Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, and was suspected as the author of certain seditious pamphlets, of his studentship at Christ Church, summarily and without hearing his defence. Fell had in former years cultivated Locke&#x27;s friendship, had kept up a correspondence with him, and in 1663 had written a testimonial in his favour; and the ready compliance of one who could on occasion offer a stout resistance to any invasion of the privileges of the university has been severely criticised. It must, however, be remembered in extenuation that the legal status of a person on the foundation of a collegiate body had not then been decided in the law-courts. He afterwards expressed his regret.

==Death==
Fell, who had never married, died &quot;worn out&quot;, according to Wood, at the age of 61. He was buried in the divinity chapel in the cathedral, below the seat which he had so often occupied when living, where a monument and an epitaph, now moved elsewhere, were placed to his memory. &quot;His death,&quot; writes John Evelyn, &quot;was an extraordinary losse to the poore church at this time&quot;. With all his faults Fell was a great man, &quot;the greatest governor,&quot; estimated Speaker Onslow, &quot;that has ever been since his time in either of the universities,&quot; and of his own college, to which he left several exhibitions for the maintenance of poor scholars, he was a second founder.

A sum of money was left by John Cross to perpetuate Fell&#x27;s memory by an annual speech in his praise, but the &quot;Felii laudes&quot; were discontinued in 1866. There are two interesting pictures of Fell at Christ Church, one where he is represented with his two friends Allestree and Dolben, and another by Anthony van Dyck. The statue placed on the northeast angle of the Great Quadrangle bears no likeness to the bishop, who is described by Hearne as a &quot;thin grave man.&quot;

<text>Carlos &quot;Panama&quot; Lewis (November 4, 1945 – September 19, 2020) was an American boxing trainer. He was convicted of tampering with the gloves of Luis Resto for his fight against Billy Collins Jr. in 1983, which subsequently led to the end of Collins&#x27; boxing career. Collins suffered from depression and possibly committed suicide following the assault.

==Early career==
Lewis was a disciple of trainer Chickie Ferrara. He was Roberto Durán&#x27;s cornerman when Duran lost a unanimous decision against Wilfred Benítez in 1982.

During the early 1980s, he was considered one of the best trainers of his time, compared with Emanuel Steward and Lou Duva. The most noted boxer in his stable was light-welterweight champion Aaron Pryor. In 1982, Pryor fought Alexis Argüello. Before the fourteenth round, a cornerman held up a plastic water bottle, but HBO cameras caught Lewis yelling, &quot;Not that bottle, the one I mixed.&quot; Pryor knocked out Arguello, but Lewis&#x27; comments fueled rumors that the bottle contained stimulants. Lewis said he &quot;mixed some peppermint liquor with water because Pryor was suffering from stomach problems.&quot;. Although Lewis was never formally sanctioned, the incident sullied his reputation, which was confirmed by his cheating discovered in subsequent fights.

It was later alleged in an interview with former Lewis-trained boxer Luis Resto in the Showtime documentary film &quot;Assault in the Ring&quot;, that Lewis would break apart pills used to treat asthma and pour the medicine into the water, giving Resto greater lung capacity in the later rounds of a fight.

==Resto–Collins controversy==

The most notorious incident in Lewis&#x27;s career took place on June 16, 1983. A fighter he was training, Luis Resto, was fighting undefeated prospect Billy Collins Jr. in a bout televised by &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;. The fight was the undercard for a fight between Roberto Durán and Davey Moore.

Resto won in a 10-round unanimous decision over a bloody Collins. After the fight, Resto came to Collins&#x27; corner to shake hands with Collins&#x27; father and trainer, Billy Sr. When Billy Sr. grabbed Resto&#x27;s hand, he discovered Resto&#x27;s gloves were thinner than normal. Screaming that he thought the gloves had no padding, Collins Sr. demanded that the New York State Boxing Commission impound the gloves. An investigation found that each glove was missing an ounce of padding. There was also a 0.75-inch hole in the palm of each glove. Collins suffered a torn iris and permanently blurred vision, ending his boxing career.

After an investigation, the New York State Boxing Commission determined Lewis had tampered with the gloves. On July 1, 1983, it permanently revoked Lewis&#x27; state boxing license. Since most state boxing commissions honor sanctions imposed by other states, this action had the effect of banning Lewis from ever having another official role in an American bout. Resto&#x27;s win was subsequently changed to a no contest.

In October 1986, Lewis and Resto were both put on trial and found guilty of assault, criminal possession of a weapon (Resto&#x27;s hands) and conspiracy. Lewis was also found guilty of tampering with a sports contest. Prosecutors charged that since Lewis had deliberately removed the padding from Resto&#x27;s gloves, the bout with Collins amounted to an illegal assault. Lewis was sentenced to six years in prison, Resto to three years. Lewis was released from prison in 1990.

Collins died on March 6, 1984, when he crashed his car into a culvert near his home in Antioch, Tennessee. Many think he may have committed suicide because he was unable to continue boxing as a result of the actions of Lewis and Resto.

Years later, during the filming of the 2008 documentary &quot;Assault in the Ring&quot;, Resto admitted that he knew Lewis had not only tampered with the gloves, but Lewis had also wrapped Resto&#x27;s hands with modern medical plaster. Lewis wet the plaster material and used it as a layer in Resto&#x27;s hand wraps, illegally increasing his punching power. He also said that Lewis had taken the padding out of his gloves on at least two other occasions. Resto also alleged that the plot centered around a large amount of money bet on himself, the underdog, by a third party who had met with Lewis prior to the fight.

Lewis maintained his innocence till his death and many of his defenders allege that someone instead removed the padding from Resto&#x27;s gloves after the bout. For instance, an official with the New York State Boxing Commission left the gloves in his car after receiving them from the state boxing commission. However, this is belied by pictures of Collins&#x27; face after the bout; it was badly swollen, and many felt it was improbable a light puncher like Resto could have inflicted such damage on his own.

When confronted by Resto and &quot;Assault in the Ring&quot; director and producer Eric Drath, Lewis again denied any wrongdoing and said that it was cornerman Artie Curley who had wrapped Resto&#x27;s hands. An agitated Lewis said that if Curley were alive today, &quot;none of this would have happened to him.&quot;

<text>Thomas Klestil (; 4 November 1932 – 6 July 2004) was an Austrian diplomat and politician who served as the president of Austria from 1992 until his death in 2004. He was elected in 1992 and re-elected in 1998.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Vienna to a working class family — his father was a tramway employee — Klestil went to school in Landstraße where he made friends with Joe Zawinul. He studied at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration and received his doctorate in 1957. After entering the civil service he worked in Austria as well as abroad, e.g. for OECD. In 1969, he established the Austrian consulate-general in Los Angeles, where he befriended Arnold Schwarzenegger. Fluent in English, Klestil served as the Permanent Representative of Austria to the United Nations (1978–1982) and Ambassador to the United States (1982–1987) prior to his election as president.

== Presidency ==
After being nominated by the conservative Austrian People&#x27;s Party to run for president, he succeeded Kurt Waldheim on 8 July 1992. However, in the course of his two terms of office, Klestil&#x27;s alienation from his own party became increasingly obvious, so much so that there was open antagonism between Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel and Klestil when, in 2000, the latter had to swear in the newly formed coalition government with Jörg Haider&#x27;s Austrian Freedom Party. Klestil, who during his election campaign had vowed to be an &quot;active&quot; president, repeatedly criticized the Austrian government and, in an interview with a Swiss daily given in 2003, stated that, theoretically speaking, it was in his power to dismiss the government any time he found it necessary to do so. As a matter of fact, the Austrian constitution gives far-reaching powers to the president, but these had never been exercised by any of Klestil&#x27;s predecessors.

=== Support of Kiryat Mattersdorf ===
Klestil gave his support to the development of Kiryat Mattersdorf, a Haredi Jewish neighborhood in northern Jerusalem founded by the Mattersdorfer Rav, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, in 1959 in memory of the Siebengemeinden (Seven Communities) of Burgenland that were destroyed in the Holocaust, Mattersdorf being one of them. Ehrenfeld&#x27;s son, Rabbi Akiva Ehrenfeld, who served as president of the neighborhood, established close ties with the Austrian government to obtain funding for several institutions, including a kindergarten and the Neveh Simcha nursing home. Following Klestil&#x27;s official state visit to Israel in 1994, which included a side tour of Kiryat Mattersdorf, Klestil hosted Ehrenfeld at an official reception at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on 24 January 1995.

== Personal life==
Klestil met his future wife Edith Wielander (1932–2011) at the age of 17 in 1949. The marriage took place in 1957 and until the election as Austrian president in 1992, the couple had three children together. The couple separated in 1994, when Klestil made public that he had a love affair with diplomat Margot Löffler. The couple divorced in September 1998, and Klestil married Löffler three months later. When Klestil died in 2004, Wielander attended the funeral service.

Klestil suffered from health issues related to his lungs, including a serious illness in 1996.

== Death and burial ==
On 5 July 2004, three days before he was to leave office, he suffered a heart attack or heart failure, probably caused by his long-term lung problems, and was left in critical condition. He died on 6 July at 23:33 local time at the AKH (&quot;Allgemeines Krankenhaus&quot; – General Hospital) in Vienna from multiple organ failure.

On 10 July 2004, his state funeral service was held in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna, and he was interred in the presidential crypt at Vienna&#x27;s Central Cemetery (Zentralfriedhof). Among the notable dignitaries who attended his funeral were Russian president Vladimir Putin, former Austrian president and UN secretary-general Kurt Waldheim, and Austrian-born Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Klestil was the fifth president of Austria to die in office since 1950.

<text>Rebecca Alie O&#x27;Connell ( , ; later Romijn-Stamos; born November 6, 1972) is an American actress and former model. She is known for her role as Mystique in the original trilogy (2000–2006) of the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series, as Joan from &quot;The Punisher&quot; (2004) (both based on Marvel Comics), the dual roles of Laure Ash and Lily Watts in &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002), and Una Chin-Riley on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (2019) and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022present). She has also had a recurring role as Alexis Meade on the ABC television series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. Her other major roles include Eve Baird on the TNT series &quot;The Librarians&quot;, voicing Lois Lane in the DC Animated Movie Universe, and as the host of the reality competition show &quot;Skin Wars&quot;.

==Early life==
Romijn was born in Berkeley, California. Her mother, Elizabeth Romijn (née Kuizenga), is a community college instructor of English as a Second Language (ESL) and textbook author. Rebecca&#x27;s father, Jaap Romijn, is a custom furniture maker. Her father is a native of Barneveld, the Netherlands, while her mother is an American of Dutch descent. Her mother met Rebecca&#x27;s father as a teenager while living in the Netherlands on a student exchange program. Romijn&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Henry Bernard Kuizenga, was a Presbyterian minister and seminary professor.

On &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, when questioned about always being glamorous and beautiful, Romijn revealed that in her early teens she was an insecure &quot;drama geek&quot; and that, as a result of her growth spurt, she suffered from scoliosis and was in constant pain. Many sources say that she was once nicknamed the &quot;Jolly Blonde Giant&quot; because of her height, but she has admitted to making that up &quot;for a laugh&quot;. While studying music (voice) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she became involved with fashion modeling and eventually moved to Paris, where she lived for more than three years.

==Career==
Among other jobs, Romijn started her modeling career in 1991. She has appeared on the covers of American, French, Spanish, Russian and Swedish editions of &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, American, Italian, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Greek, and Mexican editions of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, Allure&quot;, Glamour&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

She has appeared in advertising campaigns for Escada, Christian Dior, La Perla, Tommy Hilfiger, Furla, Liz Claiborne, J. Crew, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, bebe, La Senza, Dillard&#x27;s, Pantene, Got Milk?, Miller Lite, and Maybelline. She has walked for Giorgio Armani, Sonia Rykiel, and Anna Molinari along with the likes of Claudia Schiffer, Stephanie Seymour, Karen Mulder, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Christy Turlington. She was also the host of MTV&#x27;s &quot;House of Style&quot; from 1998 to 2000. Romijn has been featured numerous times in annual lists of the world&#x27;s most beautiful women by publications such as &quot;Maxim&quot; (2003–2007), AskMen.com (2001–2003, 2005–2006), and &quot;FHM&quot; (2000–2005). She appeared as a guest in the animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; episode &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

In 2000&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot;, Romijn had her first major film role as Mystique; she returned to the role in 2003&#x27;s sequel &quot;X2&quot; and for &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006). In these films, her costume consisted of blue makeup and strategically placed prosthetics on her otherwise nude body. In &quot;X2&quot; she shows up in a bar in one scene in her &quot;normal&quot; look and in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, as a dark-haired &quot;de-powered&quot; Mystique. The role has since been recast with Jennifer Lawrence playing the younger version of the character. She had her first leading role in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002). She also has starred in films such as &quot;Rollerball&quot;, &quot;The Punisher&quot;, and &quot;Godsend&quot;. She played the leading role in &quot;Pepper Dennis&quot;, a short-lived TV series on The WB.

In January 2007, Romijn made her first appearance on the ABC series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; as a full-time regular cast member. She played Alexis Meade, a transgender woman and the sister of lead character Daniel Meade. In April 2008, it was reported that Romijn would only be appearing as a recurring character in Season 3 due to a change in direction by the writing staff (aligning with Romijn&#x27;s pregnancy, which would have been inconsistent with her character&#x27;s storyline). In November 2007, Romijn made a guest appearance on the ABC series &quot;Carpoolers&quot;, where she played the ex-wife of the character Laird, played by her real-life husband Jerry O&#x27;Connell.

Romijn starred in the ABC series &quot;Eastwick&quot;, reuniting her with her former &quot;Pepper Dennis&quot; co-star, Lindsay Price, before ABC canceled the show on November 9, 2009. She appears in an uncredited cameo in the 2011 feature film &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, appearing as an older version of the character played by Jennifer Lawrence. Romijn appeared as lab worker Jessie on the Adult Swim live-action show &quot;&quot; for two seasons.
Between June and September 2013, she starred in TNT&#x27;s series &quot;King &amp; Maxwell&quot; as Michelle Maxwell, a former Secret Service agent who works as a private investigator.

In addition to her film ventures, Romijn has also recorded music, performing a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; for the 2005 album &quot;Electro Goth Tribute to Prince&quot;. She was also featured on the song &quot;Color Me Love&quot; for RuPaul&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Realness&quot; in 2015.
She starred as Eve Baird, the guardian of the eponymous group in &quot;The Librarians&quot;, a direct spin-off of &quot;The Librarian&quot; film series. She also hosted GSN&#x27;s original series and reality show &quot;Skin Wars&quot;. In 2018 she voiced Lois Lane in the DC Animated Movie Universe. In 2019, she was a recurring guest in the second season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, playing the character of Una Chin-Riley, first officer of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. She reprised the role in the spin-off series &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, which was released in 2022. She and husband O’Connell are currently the hosts of &quot;The Real Love Boat&quot;, which premiered October 5, 2022 on CBS.

==Personal life==
Romijn began dating actor John Stamos in 1994 after they met at a Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show where she was modeling. They became engaged on Christmas Eve 1997, and married on September 19, 1998, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. During the marriage, she used the name Rebecca Romijn-Stamos personally and professionally. They announced their separation in April 2004. Stamos filed for divorce in August 2004, and it became final on March 1, 2005.

Romijn resumed using her maiden name, but revealed in an August 2013 interview on &quot;Conan&quot;—after a &quot; Conan&quot; staff member noticed &quot;Romijn-Stamos&quot; on her driver&#x27;s license—that she had never legally changed her name back from Romijn-Stamos.

In 2004, Romijn started dating actor Jerry O&#x27;Connell. They became engaged in September 2005, and married at their home in Calabasas, California, on July 14, 2007. They have twin daughters, born on December 28, 2008.

<text>John Dolben (1625-1686) was an English priest and Church of England bishop and archbishop.

==Life==

===Early life===

He was the son of William Dolben (died 1631), prebendary of Lincoln and bishop-designate of Gloucester, and Elizabeth Williams, niece of John Williams, Archbishop of York. The leading judge Sir William Dolben was his brother.

He was educated at Westminster School under Richard Busby and at Christ Church, Oxford. He fought on the Royalist side at the Battle of Marston Moor, in 1644, and in the defence of York, and was wounded twice. By 1646, like most of the Royalists, he had abandoned all hope of victory and resumed his studies. In 1648 he was removed from the Christ Church by the Parliamentary Visitations.

Subsequently, he took orders and maintained in private the proscribed Anglican service; during these years he lived at St Aldates, Oxford, home of his wife&#x27;s father Ralph (or Richard) Sheldon, brother of the future Archbishop Sheldon.

===Bishop===

At the Restoration, he became canon of Christ Church (1660) and prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s, London (1661), no doubt partly due to the influence of Sheldon, now Bishop of London. As Dean of Westminster (1662-1683), he opposed an attempt to bring the abbey under diocesan rule. His charm, eloquence, generosity and frankness gained him enormous popularity. In 1664 he was appointed Clerk of the Closet (until 1668) and in 1666 was made Bishop of Rochester. The fall of his friend Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon the next year is said to have caused him to be in temporary disgrace, but he was quickly restored to favour. In 1675 he was appointed Lord High Almoner and in 1683 he was made Archbishop of York; he distinguished himself by reforming the discipline of the cathedrals in these dioceses. He was the first president of the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy when it received its Royal Charter in 1678.

===Death and family===
At Easter 1686, returning to York from London, he came into contact with a smallpox victim, caught the infection and died a few days later. His last months are said to have been greatly troubled by King James II&#x27;s attempts to re-establish the Roman Catholic faith.

He married Catherine Sheldon, a niece of Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury; her father was Ralph Sheldon of Stanton, Staffordshire. He had two sons, Gilbert, judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) and first of the Dolben baronets, and John Dolben, a well-known politician. A daughter named Catherine died in infancy. From a letter Gilbert wrote in 1691 it seems that the Archbishop was much troubled in his last years by John&#x27;s profligate behaviour: he was a confirmed gambler who went through all his money, and then lost the fortune he had gained by marriage to the heiress Elizabeth Mulso. His uncle the judge disinherited him, and by 1691 his wife and children were living on the charity of friends. According to Gilbert, his father&#x27;s enemies happily seized on this family tragedy as evidence that the Archbishop was a bad or neglectful parent.

The Archbishop Dolben cup presented at the York International 9s rugby league festival is named after John Dolben.

==In literature==

John Dryden, in his poem &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;, mentions Dolben, describing him as:

&quot;Him of the Western dome, whose weighty sense&lt;br&gt;Flows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.&quot;

<doc id="242325" wikidata="Q2646" url="?curid=242325" title="Friedrich Ebert">
<text>Friedrich Ebert (; 4 February 187128 February 1925) was a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) who served as the first president of Germany from 1919 until his death in 1925.

Ebert was elected leader of the SPD on the death in 1913 of August Bebel. In 1914, shortly after he assumed leadership, the party became deeply divided over Ebert&#x27;s support of war loans to finance the German war effort in World War I. A moderate social democrat, Ebert was in favour of the &quot;Burgfrieden&quot;, a political policy that sought to suppress discord over domestic issues among political parties in order to concentrate all forces in society on the conclusion of the war effort. He tried to isolate those in the party opposed to war and advocated a split.

Ebert was a pivotal figure in the German revolution of 1918–1919. When Germany became a republic at the end of World War I, he became its first chancellor. His policies at that time were primarily aimed at restoring order in Germany and suppressing the left. To accomplish these goals, he allied himself with conservative and nationalistic political forces, in particular the leadership of the military under General Wilhelm Groener and the right-wing &quot;Freikorps&quot;. With their help, the Reich government which Ebert headed crushed a number of communist and anarchist uprisings as well as those from the right, including the Kapp Putsch, a legacy that has made him a controversial historical figure.

==Early life==

Ebert was born in Heidelberg in the Grand Duchy of Baden, on 4 February 1871, shortly after the creation of the German Empire, the seventh of nine children of the tailor Karl Ebert (1834–1892) and his wife Katharina (&quot;née&quot; Hinkel; 1834–1897). Three of his siblings died at a young age. Although he wanted to attend university, this proved impossible due to his family&#x27;s lack of funds. Instead, he trained as a saddle-maker from 1885 to 1888. After he became a journeyman in 1889 he travelled, according to the German custom, from place to place in Germany, seeing the country and learning fresh details of his trade. In Mannheim, he was introduced by an uncle to the Social Democratic Party, joining it in 1889. Although Ebert studied the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, he was less interested in ideology than in practical and organisational issues that would improve the lot of the workers then and there. Ebert was placed on a police &quot;black list&quot; due to his political activities, so he kept changing his place of residence. Between 1889 and 1891, he lived in Kassel, Braunschweig, Elberfeld-Barmen, Remscheid, Quakenbrück and Bremen, where he founded and chaired local chapters of the Association of Saddlers.

After settling in Bremen in 1891, Ebert made a living doing odd jobs. In 1893, he obtained an editorial post on the socialist &quot;Bremer Bürgerzeitung&quot;. In May 1894, he married Louise Rump (1873–1955), daughter of a manual labourer, who had been employed as a housemaid and in labelling boxes and who was active in union work. He then became a pub owner that became a centre of socialist and union activity and was elected party chairman of the Bremen SPD. In 1900, Ebert was appointed a union secretary and elected a member of the &quot;Bremer Bürgerschaft&quot; (city and state assembly) as the representative of the Social Democratic Party. In 1904, Ebert presided over the national convention of the party in Bremen and became better known to a wider public. He became a leader of the &quot;moderate&quot; wing of the Social Democratic Party and in 1905 Secretary-General of the SPD, at which point he moved to Berlin. At the time, he was the youngest member of the party executive.
Meanwhile, Ebert had run for a seat in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; (parliament of Germany) several times in constituencies where the SPD had no chance of winning: 1898 Vechta (Oldenburg), 1903 and 1906 Stade (Province of Hanover). However, in 1912, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for the constituency of Elberfeld-Barmen (today part of Wuppertal). This was the election that also made the SPD the strongest party in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; with 110 out of a total of 397 members, surpassing the Centre Party. On the death of August Bebel on 13 August 1913, Ebert was elected as joint party chairman at the convention in Jena on 20 September with 433 out of 473 votes. His co-chairman was Hugo Haase.

==World War I==
When the July Crisis of 1914 erupted, Ebert was on vacation. After war was declared in early August, Ebert travelled to Zurich with party treasurer Otto Braun and the SPD&#x27;s money to be in a position to build up a foreign organisation if the SPD should be outlawed in the German Empire. He returned on 6 August and led the SPD &quot;Reichstag&quot; members to vote almost unanimously in favour of war loans, accepting that the war was a necessary patriotic, defensive measure, especially against the autocratic regime of the Tsar in Russia. In January 1916, Haase resigned. Under the leadership of Ebert and other &quot;moderates&quot; such as Philipp Scheidemann, the SPD party participated in the &quot;Burgfrieden&quot;, an agreement among the political parties in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; to suppress domestic policy differences for the duration of the war in order to concentrate the energies of the country solely on bringing the conflict to a successful conclusion for Germany. This positioned the party in favour of the war with the aim of a compromise peace, a stance that eventually led to a split in the SPD, with those radically opposed to the war leaving the SPD in early 1917 to form the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany, or USPD. Similar policy disputes caused Ebert to end his parliamentary alliance with several left-wing members of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; and start to work closely with the Centre Party and the Progress Party in 1916. Later those kicked out by Ebert called themselves &quot;Spartacists&quot;. Beginning in 1916, Ebert shared the leadership of his &quot;Reichstag&quot; delegates with Scheidemann. Although he opposed a policy of territorial gains secured through military conquest on the western front (aside from Luxembourg which was German speaking and could be easily incorporated), Ebert supported the war effort overall as a defensive struggle. Ebert experienced the traumatic loss of having two of his four sons killed in the war: Heinrich died in February 1917 in Macedonia, whereas Georg was killed in action in May 1917 in France. In June 1917, a delegation of social democrats led by Ebert travelled to Stockholm for talks with socialists from other countries about a conference that would have sought to end the war without any annexations of territory on the western front except for Luxembourg and giving back most of Alsace and Loraine with blessings from the German government. The initiative failed, however.

In January 1918, when the workers in munition factories in Berlin went on strike, Ebert joined the strike leadership but worked hard to get the strikers back to work. He was pilloried by some from the left as a &quot;traitor to the working class&quot; and by others from the right as a &quot;traitor to the fatherland&quot;.

==Revolution of 1918–19==
===Parliamentarisation===
When it became clear that the war was lost in late summer and fall of 1918, First Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff of the military Supreme Command (OHL),pushed for the &quot;parliamentarisation&quot; of the German Empire, i.e. a transfer of power to those parties that held the majority in the Reichstag (SPD, Centre Party and Progress Party). The goal was to shift the blame for the military defeat from the OHL to the politicians of the majority parties.
On 29 September 1918, Ludendorff suddenly informed Paul von Hintze, the German Foreign Minister, that the Western Front could collapse at any moment and that a ceasefire had to be negotiated without delay. However, he suggested that the request for the ceasefire should come from a new government sanctioned by the Reichstag majority. In his view, a &quot;revolution from above&quot; was needed. Chancellor Georg von Hertling and Emperor Wilhelm II agreed, although the former resigned. Scheidemann and a majority of SPD deputies were opposed to joining &quot;a bankrupt enterprise&quot;, but Ebert convinced his party, arguing that &quot;we must throw ourselves into the breach&quot; and &quot;it is our damned duty to do it&quot;. In early October, the Emperor appointed a liberal, Prince Maximilian of Baden, as chancellor to lead peace negotiations with the Allies. The new government for the first time included ministers from the SPD: Philipp Scheidemann and Gustav Bauer. The request for a ceasefire went out on 4 October. On 5 October, the government informed the German public about these events. However, there was then a delay, as the American President Wilson initially refused to agree to the ceasefire. His diplomatic notes seemed to indicate that the changes to the German government were insufficient and the fact that Wilhelm II remained head of state was a particular obstacle. Ebert did not favour exchanging the monarchy for a republic, but like many others, he was worried about the danger of a socialist revolution, which seemed more likely with every day that passed. On 28 October, the constitution was changed to make the chancellor dependent on the confidence of the Reichstag rather than the emperor. At that point, the majority parties of the Reichstag, including Ebert&#x27;s SPD, were quite satisfied with the state of affairs; what they wanted was a period of calm to deal with the issue of negotiating an armistice and a peace treaty.

===November Revolution===
The plans of the new German government were thrown into disarray when a confrontation between officers and crews on board the German fleet at Wilhelmshaven on 30 October set in motion a train of events that would result in the German Revolution of 1918–1919 that spread over a substantial part of the country over the next week. Against that backdrop, the SPD led by Ebert on 7 November demanded a more powerful voice in the cabinet, an extension of parliamentarism to Prussia and the renunciation of the throne by both the Emperor and his oldest son, Crown Prince Wilhelm. Ebert had favoured retaining the monarchy under a different ruler, but told Prince Max von Baden, &quot;If the Emperor does not abdicate, the social revolution is inevitable. But I do not want it, I even hate it like sin.&quot; On the left, the Spartacists (numbering around 100 in Berlin) and a group of around 80 to 100 popular labour leaders from Berlin known as Revolutionary Stewards prepared for a communist revolution in the capital.

On 9 November, the revolution reached Berlin as the larger companies were hit by a general strike called by the Spartacists and the Revolutionary Stewards, but also supported by the SPD and the mainstream unions. Workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were created, and important buildings occupied. As the striking masses marched on the centre of Berlin, the SPD, afraid of losing its influence on the revolution, announced that it was resigning from the government of Prince Max.

Meanwhile, Prince Max had failed to convince Emperor Wilhelm II, who was at the army headquarters at Spa, Belgium, of the need to abdicate. Wilhelm had resigned himself to the loss of the imperial crown, but still thought he could remain king of Prussia. However, under the imperial constitution, the imperial crown was tied to the Prussian crown. When Max failed to convince him of the unreality of giving up one crown and not the other, he unilaterally and untruthfully announced that Wilhelm had in fact abdicated both titles and that the Crown Prince had agreed to relinquish his right of succession. The following morning Wilhelm went into exile the Netherlands, where he signed a formal abdication statement on 28 November.

Shortly after Prince Max&#x27;s announcement, the SPD leadership arrived at the chancellery and Ebert asked the chancellor to hand over the government to him. After a short meeting of the cabinet, Prince Max resigned and, in a move that was unconstitutional because only the emperor could appoint a chancellor, handed his office over to Ebert, who thus became chancellor of Germany and minister president of Prussia. He was the first socialist, the second politician and the second commoner to hold either office. Ebert left the government of Prince Max mostly unchanged but appointed SPD members as Prussian Minister of War and military commander of the Berlin area.

Ebert&#x27;s first action as chancellor was to issue a series of proclamations asking the people to remain calm, stay out of the streets and to restore peace and order. It failed to work. Ebert then had lunch with Scheidemann at the Reichstag and, when given the opportunity to do so, refused to speak to the masses gathered outside. Scheidemann however seized upon the opportunity, and in hopes of forestalling whatever the Communist leader Karl Liebknecht planned to tell his followers at the former royal palace, proclaimed Germany a republic. A furious Ebert promptly reproached him: &quot;You have no right to proclaim the Republic!&quot; By this he meant that the decision on the form of government was to be left to an elected national assembly. Later that day, Ebert asked Prince Max to stay on as regent, but was refused.
An entirely socialist provisional government based on workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils was about to take power under Ebert&#x27;s leadership. It was called the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies. Ebert found himself in a quandary. He had succeeded in bringing the SPD to power, and he was in a position to put into law social reforms and improve the lot of the working class. Yet as a result of the revolution, he and his party were forced to share power with those on the left with whom he fundamentally disagreed: the Spartacists and the Independent Social Democrats (USPD). In the afternoon of 9 November, he grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. That evening a group of several hundred followers of the Revolutionary Stewards occupied the Reichstag building and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils the next day with an eye to naming a provisional government. In order to keep control of events and against his own anti-revolutionary convictions, Ebert decided that he needed to control the workers&#x27; councils and thus become the leader of the revolution while at the same time serving as the formal head of the German government.

On 10 November, the SPD, led by Ebert, managed to ensure that a majority of the newly elected workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils came from among their own supporters. Meanwhile, the USPD agreed to work with him and share power in the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, the new revolutionary government. Ebert announced the pact between the two socialist parties to the assembled councils who were eager for a unified socialist front and approved the parity of three members each coming from SPD and USPD. Ebert and Haase (USPD) were to be the joint chairmen. The same day, Ebert received a telephone call from OHL chief of staff Wilhelm Groener, who offered to cooperate with him. According to Groener, he promised Ebert the loyalty of the military in exchange for some demands: that Ebert fight Bolshevism, end the system of workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils, call a national assembly and return the country to a state of law and order. In return Ebert promised that command of the troops would stay with the officer corps. Hindenburg remained head of the OHL to ensure and orderly return of the army. This initiated a regular communication between the two that involved daily telephone conversations over a secret line, according to Groener. The agreement between the two became known as the Ebert–Groener pact.

In domestic policy, a number of social reforms were quickly introduced by the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies under Ebert&#x27;s leadership, including unemployment benefits, the eight-hour workday, universal suffrage for everyone over the age of 20, the right of farmhands to organise, and increases in workers&#x27; old-age, sick and unemployment benefits.
===Violence in Berlin===
In the turbulent early weeks of the revolution, Ebert and the leadership of the SPD sided with the conservative and nationalistic elements in German society (civil servants, armed forces, police, judiciary) against the forces that wanted a more radical revolution. The majority of the members of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils also viewed themselves as supporters of the government rather than of the Spartacists, the only group that wanted a dictatorship of the workers. Ebert and Groener worked out a plan to restore order in Berlin by having army units returning from the Western Front move in and disarm all paramilitary forces from 10 to 15 December. In a speech to the returning troops, Ebert told them in words that &quot;appeared to justify the stab-in-the-back myth&quot;:No enemy has overcome you. It was only when the superior numbers of our opponents in men and material became increasingly oppressive that we gave up the fight. And it was precisely in view of your heroic courage that it was our duty not to call for further futile sacrifices from you. ... You will not find our state as you left it. Something new has emerged: German freedom has arisen. The old rule, which lay like a curse on our actions, has been shaken off by the German people. They have made themselves masters of their own destiny. Above all, the hopes of German freedom rest on you. ... No one suffered more than you from the injustice of the old regime. We thought of you when we did away with a disastrous system; we fought for freedom for you; we won the right to work for you.After the ten divisions had arrived, however, rather than remaining as a cohesive force, they dispersed to their homes. 

On 16 December, the Reich Congress of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils met in Berlin and set the date for elections to the National Assembly for 19 January 1919. It also passed a resolution that was aimed at ensuring that the military would be under the strict control of the civilian government and called for a powerful position of the soldiers&#x27; councils vis-à-vis the professional officer corps. This was unacceptable to the leaders of the military, and the OHL began to establish volunteer regiments in the Berlin area.
Fighting erupted on 24 December in central Berlin. Today this episode is known as the 1918 Christmas crisis. On 23 December, dissatisfied members of the revolutionary People&#x27;s Navy Division occupied the chancellery and put the Peoples&#x27; Deputies under house arrest. Ebert asked the OHL for help over the phone, and troops assembled on the outskirts of the capital. During the night, Ebert ordered the troops to attack, which they did in the morning of 24 December. When the fighting stopped in the afternoon, the People&#x27;s Navy forces held the field, and they returned to their barracks, ending the crisis. As a result of the event, which Karl Liebknecht called &quot;Ebert&#x27;s Bloody Christmas&quot; because it had cost 67 lives, the USPD members left the Council of the Peoples&#x27; Deputies on 29 December. The next day, SPD members Gustav Noske and Rudolf Wissell took their place, and from that point on, government communiques were signed (i.e. federal government) instead of &quot;Council of the Peoples&#x27; Deputies&quot;. At the same time, the Spartacists severed their remaining links with the USPD and set themselves up as the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

On 5 January 1919, the USPD and KPD called for demonstrations to protest the dismissal of the head of the Berlin police, who was a USPD member, for supporting the revolutionary sailors during the Christmas uprising. The demonstration grew into the Spartacist uprising, which had the goal of replacing the national government with a council republic. After Ebert&#x27;s negotiations with the insurgents broke down, his major concern was with maintaining internal peace. He ordered the rebellion to be quashed, and Gustav Noske, who was in charge of the Army and Navy, used both regular forces and Freikorps units to bring the uprising to an end. Around 170 people lost their lives, including KPD leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, who were murdered extrajudicially by the Freikorps. 

==President of Germany==

In the first German presidential election, held on 11 February 1919, five days after the National Assembly convened in Weimar, Ebert was elected provisional president of the German Republic by the members of the assembly. He remained in the position after the new constitution came into force and was sworn in as president of Germany on 21 August 1919. He was Germany&#x27;s first-ever democratically elected head of state, and was also the first commoner, the first social democrat, the first civilian, and the first person from a proletarian background to hold the position. In the life of the unified German Reich from 1871 to 1945, he was also the only head of state who was unequivocally committed to democracy.
One of Ebert&#x27;s first tasks as president was to deal with the Treaty of Versailles. When the treaty&#x27;s terms became public on 7 May 1919, it was cursed by Germans of all political shades as an onerous &quot;dictated peace&quot;, particularly because Germany had essentially been handed the treaty and told to sign without any negotiations. Ebert himself denounced the treaty as &quot;unrealizable and unbearable&quot;. However, Ebert was well aware of the possibility that Germany would not be in a position to reject the treaty. He believed that the Allies would invade Germany from the west if Germany refused to sign. To appease public opinion, he asked Hindenburg if the army was capable of holding out if the Allies renewed hostilities. He promised to urge rejection of the treaty if there was even the remote possibility that the army could make a stand. Hindenburg, with some prodding from Groener, concluded that the army was not capable of resuming the war even on a limited scale. Rather than tell Ebert himself, he dispatched Groener to telephone the Army&#x27;s conclusion to the president. The National Assembly approved the treaty by a large majority on 24 June.
The government&#x27;s fight against communist forces and recalcitrant socialists went on after Ebert became president. From January to May 1919, in some areas through the summer, violence continued. Since the 19 January elections had returned a solid majority for the democratic parties (SPD, Centre, and DDP), Ebert felt that the revolutionary forces had no legitimacy left. The individual workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils across Germany had dissolved by late in the autumn of 1919.

In March 1920, during the right-wing Kapp Putsch instigated by parts of the Reichswehr, some Freikorps units plus nationalist and monarchist elements, the government, including Ebert, had to flee Berlin. However, a refusal by civil servants to accept the self-declared government and a general strike called by the legitimate cabinet led to the collapse of the putsch. After it ended, striking workers in the Ruhr region refused to return to work. Led by members of the USPD and KPD, they presented an armed challenge to the authority of the government. It then sent Reichswehr and Freikorps troops to quell the Ruhr uprising by force.

To avoid an election campaign at a critical time, the Reichstag extended Ebert&#x27;s term of office on 24 October 1922 until 30 June 1925, with a majority vote that was sufficient for a change to the constitution.

As president, Ebert appointed centre-right figures like Wilhelm Cuno and Hans Luther chancellor and made rigorous use of his wide-ranging powers under Article 48 of the Weimar constitution. For instance, he used it to deal with the Kapp Putsch and the Beer Hall Putsch. Through 1924, he used the presidency&#x27;s emergency powers a total of 134 times.

==Death and funeral==

Ebert suffered from gallstones and frequent bouts of cholecystitis. Vicious attacks by Ebert&#x27;s right-wing adversaries, including slander and ridicule, were often condoned or even supported by the judiciary when Ebert sought redress through the court system. The constant necessity to defend himself against those attacks also undermined his health. In December 1924, a court in Magdeburg fined a journalist who had called Ebert a &quot;traitor to his country&quot; for his role in the January 1918 strike, but the court also said that, in terms of strict legalism, Ebert had in fact committed treason. These proceedings prevented him from seeking medical help for a while, as he wanted to be available to give evidence.

Ebert became acutely ill in mid-February 1925 from what was first believed to be influenza. His condition deteriorated over the following two weeks, and at that time he was thought to be suffering from another episode of gallbladder disease. He became acutely septic on the night of 23 February and underwent an emergency appendectomy (which was performed by August Bier) in the early hours of the following day for what turned out to be appendicitis. Four days later, he died of septic shock, aged 54.

Ebert was buried in Heidelberg. Several high-ranking politicians and a trade union leader made speeches at his funeral, as did a Protestant minister, Hermann Maas, pastor at the Church of the Holy Spirit in Heidelberg (which until the 1930s was used by both Lutheran and Catholic congregations). By thus taking part in the obsequies, Maas caused something of a scandal in his church and among political conservatives, because Ebert had been an outspoken atheist (although he was baptised a Catholic, he had officially abandoned Christian observance many years before his last illness).

== Historical evaluation ==

Some historians have defended Ebert&#x27;s actions as unfortunate but inevitable if the creation of a socialist state on the model that had been promoted by Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht and the communist Spartacus League was to be prevented. German historians who had lived through the Weimar Republic, including Sebastian Haffner, later argued that organized communism was not politically relevant in Germany at the time. The tolerance of Ebert and his minister of Defence Gustav Noske with regards to violence on German streets, so long as the pro-government &quot;Freikorps&quot; were involved, has been detailed by historians in the context of increasing support for fascist ideas.

Friedrich Ebert is credited with founding the &quot;German Republic&quot; between February and August 1919 in Weimar quite deliberately so that the other nation states knew, there was a Germany not devoted to militarism. As historians have stressed, Weimar in Thuringia, did provide parliamentarians with security assurance Berlin could not provide. Friedrich Ebert linked the &quot;spririt of Weimar&quot; with building &quot;the new Germany&quot;. Ebert&#x27;s social democrat comrade Philipp Scheidemann agreed, pointing out that Weimar was the &quot;city of Goethe&quot;. Ebert formed the Weimar Republic government with three SPD and three USPD ministers. Shop stewards reconvened the workers&#x27; councils (Räte) at a congress in Berlin and declared that Ebert&#x27;s government was merely a &quot;Council of People&#x27;s Commissionars&quot; answerable to the workers&#x27; councils. Historians emphasize, that Ebert was only able to end the state of emergency in Germany by granting all political offenders an amnesty.

In Ebert&#x27;s opinion only &#x27;reforms&#x27;, not a revolution, could advance the causes of democracy and socialism. He therefore has been called a traitor by leftists, who argue that he paved the way for the ascendancy of the far right and even of Adolf Hitler. Conservatives, who think his policies were justified, claim that he saved Germany from soviet excesses.

<text>Henry Hammond (18 August 1605 – 25 April 1660) was an English churchman, church historian and theologian, who supported the Royalist cause during the English Civil War.

==Early life==

He was born at Chertsey in Surrey on 18 August 1605, the youngest son of John Hammond (c. 1555–1617), physician to the royal household under King James I, who purchased the site of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey in 1602. His brother was Judge Thomas Hammond, a regicide of King Charles I. He was educated at Eton College, and from age 13 at Magdalen College, Oxford, becoming demy or scholar in 1619. On 11 December 1622 he graduated B.A. (M.A. 30 June 1625, B.D. 28 January 1634, and D.D. in March 1639), and in 1625 was elected a fellow of the college. He took Holy Orders in 1629, and in 1633 in preaching before the court, standing in for Accepted Frewen, he won the approval of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and was presented with the living of Penshurst in Kent. His mother kept house for him, and aided him in parochial work. He undertook the education of William Temple, and supported the education of the antiquary William Fulman.

==Royalist cleric==
In 1640 he became a member of convocation, and was present at the passing of Laud&#x27;s new canons. Soon after the meeting of the Long parliament, the committee for depriving scandalous ministers summoned Hammond, but he declined to leave Penshurst. He was nominated one of the Westminster Assembly, by Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton. In 1643 he was made Archdeacon of Chichester, recommended by Brian Duppa. Instead of sitting in the Assembly, he took part in the unsuccessful rising at Tonbridge in favour of King Charles I: Hammond helped to raise a troop of horse in his neighbourhood for the King&#x27;s service, and was obliged to flee in disguise for Oxford, then the royal headquarters. He left Penshurst by night in July for the house of a friend, Thomas Buckner, who had been his tutor at Magdalen. Here he was joined by an old friend, John Oliver. When they had to move on, the two set off for Winchester, then held by the Royalists. On their journey a messenger announced to Oliver that he had been chosen President of Magdalen, and Hammond accompanied him to Oxford. Hammond procured rooms in his own college, and devoted himself to study and writing. In 1644 he published anonymously his popular &quot;Practical Catechism&quot;. One of Charles I&#x27;s last acts at Carisbrooke Castle was to entrust to Sir Thomas Herbert a copy of the book, to give to his son Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester.

Hammond was chaplain to the royal commissioners at the Treaty of Uxbridge (30 January 1645), where he disputed with Richard Vines, one of the parliamentary envoys. He returned to Oxford, and about 17 March 1645 Charles I bestowed upon him a canonry at Christ Church; the university chose him to be public orator at the same time, and he was made one of the royal chaplains. On 26 April 1646 the King fled from Oxford, and Oxford surrendered (24 June 1646). Charles I, on 31 January 1647, the day after his arrival at Holmby House, requested Parliament to allow Hammond and another chaplain to attend him. This was refused on the ground that neither of them had taken the Solemn League and Covenant. When Charles I was removed by the army to Childersley (5 June 1647), Thomas Fairfax and his officers agreed that Charles I&#x27;s request for his chaplains should be complied with. About a fortnight later Hammond and Gilbert Sheldon, another royal chaplain, in company with James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, joined the king. Parliament sent an order for their removal, but the army, now independent in its power, paid no attention. The chaplains were summoned to the bar of the house, but disregarded the summons. Fairfax wrote deprecating the notion that they would prejudice the peace of the state. At Woburn, Caversham, and Hampton Court, Hammond was constantly with the king.

At Hampton Court Hammond introduced to him his nephew, Colonel Robert Hammond, soon to be governor of the Isle of Wight. Charles I, thinking he might trust his chaplain&#x27;s nephew, escaped towards the Isle of Wight (12 November 1647), and was placed by the governor in Carisbrooke Castle, where Sheldon and Hammond again joined him. At Christmas 1647 they were removed from their attendance. Hammond returned to Oxford, where parliamentary visitors had been at work. Samuel Fell, dean of Christ Church, was in prison. Hammond, appointed sub-dean of Christ Church, took on the management of the college. He was soon summoned before the visitors at Merton College, and refused to submit to their authority, and was deprived and imprisoned, together with Sheldon, by an order of Parliament. Edward Corbet, a member of the Westminster Assembly, who succeeded to Hammond&#x27;s canonry at Christ Church in January 1648, resigned it in August, after persuading himself (it is said) that Hammond had acted on principle. Colonel Evelyn, the puritan governor of Wallingford Castle, to whom Parliament sent an order for the custody of Sheldon and Hammond, declined to act as their gaoler, and said that he would only receive them as friends.

At Westwood Hammond settled for the remainder of his life. In August 1651 he attended Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet to the royal camp at Worcester, and had an interview with King Charles II. Pakington was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester, 3 September but soon returned home uninjured. In 1655 an ordinance was issued forbidding the ejected clergy to act as schoolmasters or private chaplains, or perform any clerical functions, thus depriving them of all means of subsistence. Hammond and others were much involved in supporting clergy in this position. In the last six years of his life his health began to fail.

==Death and reputation==
Hammond died of an attack of stone on 25 April 1660, the day that Parliament voted that the king should be brought back; had he lived he would have been made bishop of Worcester.

He was buried in the family vault of the Pakingtons, in the chancel of Hampton Lovett Church. The monument was sculpted by Joshua Marshall. There is a Latin inscription on his monument by Humphrey Henchman, bishop of Salisbury, and afterwards of London. Hammond left his books to his friend Richard Allestree.

Hammond was held in high esteem even by his opponents. He was an excellent preacher; Charles I pronounced him the most natural orator he had ever heard.

==Works==

His writings, published in four folio volumes (1674–1684), consist mostly of controversial sermons and tracts; he produced more than 50 separate works.

The &quot;Anglo-Catholic Library&quot; contains four volumes of his &quot;Miscellaneous Theological Works&quot; (1847–1850). The best of them are his Practical Catechism, first published in 1644; his &quot;Paraphrase and Annotations on the New Testament&quot; (1653); and an incomplete work of a similar nature on the Old Testament. His &quot;Life&quot; by John Fell, prefixed to the collected Works, was reprinted in vol. iv. of Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical Biography&quot;.

Hammond was a pioneer Anglican theologian, much influenced by Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes, but also by Arminianism in the form it took in Hugo Grotius, whom he defended in his writings. Some of Hammond&#x27;s views were highly idiosyncratic: for example, &quot;Paraphrase and Annotations on the New Testament&quot; emphasized the (supposed) role of Gnosticism as a clandestine &quot;enemy&quot; of ancient Christianity, claiming Gnostics were exceedingly similar to the contemporary Enthusiasts of his own period (who were typically anti-royalist). Yet Hammond was also the first English scholar to compare manuscripts of the &quot;New Testament&quot;. He relied heavily on his readings in patristics, and with James Ussher and Isaak Voss argued in favour of the authenticity of the Ignatian Epistles, which could be read as supporting episcopacy. He was attacked by Salmasius and David Blondel, and defended himself. His defence and celebration of episcopacy as traditional was then followed by many English high church theologians: Miles Barne, Henry Dodwell, Fell, Peter Heylyn, Benjamin Lany, Thomas Long, Simon Lowth, John Pearson, Herbert Thorndike, and Francis Turner.

He read widely, and was a diligent scholar. He translated Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; in 1657, under the title of &quot;Les Provinciales, or the Mystery of Jesuitisme, discovered in certain letters written upon occasion of the present differences at Sorbonne between the jansenists and the molinists&quot;, London, Royston, 1657).

<text>The Panasonic CD interface, also known as the MKE CD interface (for Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics), SLCD or simply Panasonic, is a proprietary computer interface for connecting a CD-ROM drive to an IBM PC compatible computer. It was used briefly in the early 1990s, and is no longer in production.

The interface is similar in physical format to an IDE, and an IDE cable may be used; however, the CD-ROM drive cannot be connected to the IDE bus and must have an interface card. Some SoundBlaster cards were manufactured with a port to connect to the CD-ROM drive with this interface.

FreeBSD supports this interface with &quot;matcd&quot; driver. Linux supports these drives via the &quot;sbcd&quot;, &quot;sbpcd&quot; or &quot;pcd&quot; drivers.

<doc id="242333" wikidata="Q376961" url="?curid=242333" title="Glory (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Glory is a fictional character in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; portrayed by Clare Kramer. Glory was a god from a hell dimension and was the major antagonist of the fifth season. She appeared first in episode 5 and made appearances in 12 other episodes throughout the season. She made a further brief appearance in the first episode of season 7. 

==Character biography==

===History===
Glorificus (also known as &quot;Glory&quot;) is a god from a hell dimension ruled by three hell gods. Fearful that Glorificus would seize total control of the dimension for herself, the two other gods aligned and banished her into the earthly dimension, where her essence is imprisoned in a human child named Ben, portrayed by Charlie Weber.

Glory&#x27;s strength is greater than that of any Slayer, vampire, or antagonist previously shown as a season villain of &quot;Buffy&quot;, but her powers are weak when compared to those she had in her home dimension. Dark magicks prevent humans in the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe from learning that Glory and Ben are the same; even if she transforms right in front of someone, they have no memory of the incident. The spell does not affect supernatural characters like vampires and demons. This flaw becomes a recurring joke in the penultimate episode of season 5, where Spike finds himself repeatedly having to explain that Ben and Glory are the same person, only for people to either misunderstand him or forget about it instantly. As Ben and Glory&#x27;s personalities begin to merge more, the magic weakens until, in the finale, the whole gang sees through it. This human form is Glory&#x27;s only weakness; if the human vessel containing her is killed, then Glory perishes with him.

Glory&#x27;s goal through her time onscreen is to find the Key, a &quot;mystical energy nexus,&quot; which is the only way for her to return to her original dimension. Using the Key will break down the barriers between all dimensions, causing all worlds to bleed into each other and allowing &quot;Hell to reign on Earth&quot;. The Key was safeguarded by an ancient group of monks known as The Order of Dagon. When they discovered that &quot;The Beast&quot; (Glory) was searching for the Key, they chose to hide it by transforming the Key into a human girl. They placed her under the protection of the Slayer Buffy, altering the memories of the Slayer and anyone connected to her into believing the girl was Buffy&#x27;s younger sister Dawn. Glory eventually destroys the Order of Dagon and interrogates the last monk until he reveals to Glory (under torture) that the Key has been transformed, but not what the Key has become. After being rescued by Buffy, the monk reveals to Buffy that Dawn is the Key, something she already suspected.

Glory is also opposed by a military order known as the &quot;Knights of Byzantium,&quot; composed of knights and clerics, who appear in episode 12 of season 5. They swear to prevent Glory from using the Key, and they attempt to kill Dawn before she can be found by Glory. In the 20th episode of the season, &quot;Spiral,&quot; a large group of knights besieges Buffy and Dawn, but Glory arrives and slaughters nearly all of them, taking the Key with her. This episode marks the last appearance of the Knights of Byzantium.

===The Key===
The Key is an ancient power, described as &quot;an ancient green mystical energy&quot; that, according to Glory, &quot;is almost as old as she is.&quot; Who or what created the Key or how is unknown; even its true purpose is never fully revealed. The Key seems to work by destroying the barriers that separate one dimension from another. The longer the Key is in use, the more the walls of reality begin to break down. When the Key is activated in the last episode of season 5, a small portal opens and begins to grow, in which demons, creatures, and entire dimensions begin to immediately bleed through.

Buffy&#x27;s first confrontation with Glory comes shortly after she discovers there is something not right about Dawn. Glory beats Buffy severely, destroying an entire building in the process. Buffy manages to escape during an outburst by Glory, which caused the building to collapse. She escapes with the last surviving monk who quickly reveals the truth about Dawn being the Key and Buffy her protector.

===Sunnydale===

Although Glory enters early on in season 5, the Scooby Gang knows very little about her, only discovering her name from one of Glory&#x27;s minions. Glory&#x27;s god-like status, extreme power level, origins, and the Key&#x27;s true nature and history are not known until later episodes. Glory comes to Sunnydale looking for &quot;The Key,&quot; which will allow her to return to her own dimension. 

She begins the quest to locate the Key, aided by a race of pale, black-eyed demons who are loyal to her almost to a fault, though she does not care for them and viciously abuses them. Glory quickly establishes herself as one of Buffy&#x27;s most dangerous and determined enemies. At one point, she confronts Buffy in her own home, openly threatening to kill Buffy&#x27;s friends and family and force Buffy to watch her do so.

Glory is a god in a human body; the human mind can not control such power, which gradually turns Glory insane. To maintain her sanity and power, Glory feeds off humans&#x27; mental energies through a process that Buffy and her friends refer to as &quot;brain-sucking&quot;. She inserts her fingers into the victim&#x27;s head, absorbing the energies that bind the victim&#x27;s mind. The humans that she &quot;devours&quot; in this way become incoherent and mentally unstable and can also see Dawn in her true form. One of her unfortunate victims is Willow&#x27;s girlfriend, Tara, who later inadvertently betrays Dawn to Glory. The Scoobies (Buffy and her friends) try to run, but Glory still manages to kidnap Dawn shortly afterward.

The Key can only be used at a certain time, and as that time draws near, the power that separates Glory from Ben dissolves. Both characters still inhabit Ben&#x27;s body separately, but their memories and personalities begin to blur together.

After recovering from a mental breakdown caused by Glory&#x27;s kidnapping of Dawn, Buffy decides to attack Glory with everything she has: Willow&#x27;s magic spell to restore Tara&#x27;s sanity, at the same time weakening Glory&#x27;s mind; the Dagon Sphere (a weapon created by the monks that cause physical pain to Glory); Buffy&#x27;s robot double (the &quot;Buffybot&quot;), originally Spike&#x27;s sex toy; Olaf, The Troll God&#x27;s Hammer (with which Buffy can beat Glory in battle and severely weaken her albeit temporarily, due to the hammer being a weapon of the gods); and eventually a wrecking ball, commandeered by Xander. Glory is left defeated and significantly weakened, losing her hold on this reality and returning to the form and mind of Ben. Buffy then tells Ben to tell Glory to leave Sunnydale and never return. As Buffy walks off, Giles knows that Glory will eventually regain her power and return to get her revenge on Buffy unless Ben is killed, so he smothers Ben to death with his bare hands, ensuring that Glory can never return.

After Glory&#x27;s defeat, her final appearance in the series is at the end of the episode &quot;Lessons,&quot; as an avatar of the First Evil along with most of the other major villains from the series.

==Name==
&quot;That Which Cannot Be Named&quot; came into existence before written word, and therefore (as its title implies) has no name. When the hell-god came to this dimension, she was dubbed &quot;Glorificus&quot; or sometimes &quot;Glorifius&quot; by her demon minions and in most textual references, is shortened to &quot;Glory.&quot; She was also known by her minions as &quot;the Glorious One&quot; (among many other amusing, groveling titles such as &quot;Her Splendiferousness,&quot; &quot;Her Sparkling Luminescence&quot; and &quot;Oh Sweaty-Naughty-Feelings-Causing One&quot;), and as &quot;the Beast&quot; or &quot;the Abomination&quot; by the human priesthood and the Knights of Byzantium. (She has nothing to do with The Beast who appeared in &quot;Angel&quot;, the spin-off series of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;). The Scooby Gang and Ben often refer to her by the insulting name of &quot;Hell-Bitch.&quot;

According to &quot;Buffy&quot; writer Jane Espenson, Glory was originally named Cherry.

==Powers and abilities==
In season 5, episode 13, &quot;Blood Ties,&quot; the gang begins discussing the Watcher Council&#x27;s research on Glory. Buffy asks whether or not Glory, as a god, can summon elements like lightning. Giles responds, &quot;Normally, yes, but since she is in human form, her powers are severely limited.&quot; During season 5 the following were demonstrated:
* Near-invulnerability: Only a Troll God&#x27;s hammer was able to do any lasting damage to Glory when used repeatedly. In &quot;Tough Love,&quot; Willow&#x27;s lightning bolts caused her pain, but caused no visible damage, though she comments that Willow&#x27;s assault &quot;slowed her down&quot;. By the time of the season finale, Buffy mentions that Willow was the only one ever successful in actually hurting Glory up to that point. When a building collapses on top of her (see below), she was slowed down but was unharmed. Similarly, she was unharmed after being hit by a truck. 
* Superhuman strength: Glory possesses enormous physical strength far beyond that of most, if not all, vampires, demons, or Slayers. She is considered to be the most physically powerful Big Bad in the series, shown to be able to inflict massive damage on her opponents through pure brute force and physical strength alone. In &quot;Intervention&quot;, she kicked Spike clear across her living room, through a solid wooden door, and to the other end of the room after losing her patience with him. In &quot;Tough Love&quot;, she squeezes Tara&#x27;s hand to the point where it oozes blood, right before Glory feeds off of her brain. In &quot;Spiral&quot;, she punches a hole through the barrier that Willow generated. Even Buffy, with her slayer strength, could barely stand toe-to-toe in a fight of brawn.
* Superspeed: Glory&#x27;s super-speed is depicted as a fast-moving blur that is apparently invisible to the naked eye in the &quot;Buffy&quot; universe. This is seen when she pursues Buffy and Dawn immediately after Tara, in her insane state, accidentally reveals that Dawn is the Key.
* Brain sucking: The ability to drain the mental energy of humans. This is primarily to maintain her own mental strength, but would also prevent Ben&#x27;s form from resuming control. Not only does the drain draw out all energy leaving the victims in an insane state, they are also able to visually see the Key&#x27;s true energy and ultimately become psychically linked to Glory and the Key.
* Shroud of illusion: A mystical shroud cast to prevent people from learning that she and Ben are the same person, the origins of which are unclear. It only works on humans; vampires, demons, and other non-humans characters are immune. She loses this capability in the penultimate episode of season 5.
* Creature identification: The ability to differentiate between vampires, humans and any other creature from the Key, as seen in &quot;Intervention&quot;, when her minions capture Spike under the mistaken impression that he is the Key. 
* Omnilingualism: The ability to speak and understand any human or demon language. This power is shown when humans and demons talk to her in other languages and she understands.
* Magic: In &quot;Shadow&quot;, Glory casts an ancient spell that causes an ordinary snake to grow to a massive size and grants it the ability to see the true form of the Key, in addition to making it completely loyal to her. According to Giles, a spell such as that would need enormous levels of magic to perform, and Glory cast it easily.

The extent of Glory&#x27;s true powers as a hell-god were never revealed or used, though according to Gregor in &quot;Spiral&quot;, they were beyond what even her compatriot hell-gods could conceive. She later secures Ben&#x27;s aid in recapturing Dawn by promising him immortality.

==Personality==
Clare Kramer, the actress who played Glory, said the character&#x27;s best strength was her lack of self-doubt: &quot;She was completely secure in herself, focused on what she wanted and dedicated to her cause.&quot; Her strength was also her downfall; Kramer notes that Glory was unable &quot;to look at more than just herself.&quot;

According to Doug Petrie, &quot;Joss very much wanted someone who was like the Joker to Batman. Someone who was just dynamic, charismatic and psychotic and we have all that. And Glory looks a lot better in a hot little red dress than the Joker ever did! We&#x27;ve got it all in Glory.&quot;

==Servants==
* Dreg
* Jinx
* Murk
* Slook
* Gronx
* The High Priest Minion
* Doc

==Art and legacy==
The picture in the living room of Glory&#x27;s mansion is a copy of Tamara de Lempicka&#x27;s &quot;Group of Four Nudes&quot;. The Polish art déco/futurist artist is renowned for being strongly feminist and openly bisexual/lesbian.

In the &quot;Buffy &amp; Angel: Official Yearbook&quot; 2006, Glory was voted number one by fans as &quot;Best Buffyverse Villain&quot;, followed by Angelus and the Mayor respectively.

==Appearances==

===Canonical appearances===
Glory appeared in 13 canonical episodes:

* Season 5: &quot;No Place Like Home&quot; (first appearance); &quot;Family&quot;; &quot;Shadow&quot;; &quot;Checkpoint&quot;; &quot;Blood Ties&quot;; &quot;I Was Made to Love You&quot;; &quot;Forever&quot;; &quot;Intervention&quot;; &quot;Tough Love&quot;; &quot;Spiral; &quot;The Weight of the World&quot;; &quot;The Gift&quot; (killed)
* Season 7: &quot;Lessons&quot; (as an incarnation of The First Evil)

==Merchandise==
The character&#x27;s popularity prompted Diamond Select Toys to release two unique Glory action figures in 2006 and 2007: one figure is modeled on the character wearing her trademark red dress, and the other features the character dressed in black, as seen in &quot;The Gift.&quot; The latter action figure was released as part of a set, with the other figure being Dawn from the same episode.

A maquette of Glory was released as part of Electric Tiki&#x27;s &quot;Tooned-Up Television&quot; line.

<text>The Entwicklungsring Nord (Northern development circle) - abbreviated ERNO - was a 1961 joint venture of Bremen-based Weserflug and Focke-Wulf with Hamburger Flugzeugbau to develop parts for rockets and get involved in space activities.

==Jet-powered aircraft VFW 614==
In 1961 work began on a small, jet-powered aircraft initially styled Erno-61-4. After Weserflug and Focke Wulf formally merged into Vereinigte Flugtechnische Werke (VFW) in 1964, the machine was redesignated VFW 614. The draft design was amended to a STOL 40-44 passenger jet with overwing engines, for easier operation from unprepared runways. German government subsidies enabled development to start in earnest in 1966. The first prototype started in August 1968, but then VFW and Fokker of the Netherlands formed a joint transnational holding company.

The prototype flew on 14 July 1971 but crashed next February. Two more prototypes flew in 1972. German, FAA, and French DGA certifications completed in 1974, 1975, &amp; 1976 respectively. The collaborative production arrangements involved Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) in Germany, Fokker VFW in the Netherlands and SABCA and Avions Fairey in Belgium. The first sale was to Cimber Air, which started commercial flights in November 1975.

The VFW-Fokker alliance affected the VFW 614 negatively, as Fokker needed to sell its competing F27 and F28. National subsidies were diverted to the Airbus program, and the end came for the VFW 614. On 19 August 1977 the nineteenth (including prototypes) and last machine was completed.

Few VFW 614 aircraft remained in use: The German Luftwaffe (Koln/Bonn Flugbereitschaft) continued flying VFW 614 until they finally ceased in 1998. The Luftwaffe machines went on to serve EADS/Airbus at Bremen (one aircraft for fly-by-wire development for the A380), and DLR in Braunschweig for development and research duties – the final flight of the last airworthy VFW 614 was on 7 December 2012.

==Space activities==

===Helios, TD ===
ERNO participated in several satellite programs mostly being responsible for structure and thermal control, propulsion. A mechanically very challenging item (i.e. the antenna of the German satellite HELIOS) was manufactured by ERNO.

===Spacelab===
The European Space Agency ESA in June 1974 named a consortium headed by ERNO-VFW Fokker (Zentralgesellschaft VFW-Fokker GmbH) to build pressurized modules called Spacelab. British Aerospace, under contract to ERNO-VFW Fokker, built five -long, unpressurized, U-shaped pallet segments.

West Germany provided 53.3% of Spacelab&#x27;s cost and fulfilled 52.6% of all Spacelab work contracts. ERNO VFW Fokker, in competition with MBB, submitted the winning design, and became the prime contractor for Spacelab. MBB in 1981 took over VFW Fokker. The ERNO plant in Bremen continued as the headquarters for Spacelab design, production management, component testing, and assembly.

===COLUMBUS===
The Bremen team of the new MBB-ERNO prepared the first COLUMBUS proposal as Prime Contractor based on the experiences gained on Spacelab. As next step MBB-ERNO became a section of Daimler-Benz called DASA (Daimler-Benz Aerospace). Following it became a part of EADS Astrium Space Transportation, then Airbus Defence and Space. The engineering team for crewed space developments is responsible for Columbus operations and maintenance and involved in the development of NASA&#x27;s Orion program.

The Bremen launcher team was split off and integrated in Airbus Safran Launchers part of ArianeGroup.

<doc id="242343" wikidata="Q314553" url="?curid=242343" title="Robert Silverberg">
<text>Robert Silverberg (born January 15, 1935) is a prolific American science fiction author and editor. He is a multiple winner of both Hugo and Nebula Awards, a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, and a Grand Master of SF since 2004. 

Especially noted Silverberg works include the novella &quot;Nightwings&quot; (1969) and the novels &quot;Downward to the Earth&quot; (1970), &quot;The World Inside&quot; (1971), &quot;Dying Inside&quot; (1972), and &quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1980; the first of the Majipoor series).

Silverberg has attended every Hugo Award ceremony since the inaugural event in 1953.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Silverberg was born on January 15, 1935, to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York. A voracious reader since childhood, he began submitting stories to science fiction magazines during his early teenage years. He received a BA in English Literature from Columbia University, in 1956. While at Columbia he wrote the juvenile novel &quot;Revolt on Alpha C&quot; (1955), published by Thomas Y. Crowell with the cover notice: &quot;A gripping story of outer space&quot;. He won his first Hugo in 1956 as the &quot;best new writer&quot;.

===Career===
In that year Silverberg was the author or co-author of four of the six stories in the August issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot;, breaking his record set in the previous issue. For the next four years, by his own count, he wrote a million words a year, mostly for magazines and Ace Doubles. He used his own name as well as a range of pseudonyms during this era, and often worked in collaboration with Randall Garrett, who was a neighbor at the time. (The Silverberg/Garrett collaborations too were published under a variety of pseudonyms, the best-known being Robert Randall.) From 1956 to 1959, Silverberg routinely averaged five published stories a month, and he had over 80 stories published in 1958 alone.

In 1959, the market for science fiction slumped due in part to changing tastes among readers, and also due to the bankruptcy of several leading magazines of the era. Silverberg adapted by writing copiously in other fields, from historical non-fiction to crime fiction and softcore pornography. &quot;Bob Silverberg, a giant of science fiction... was doing two [books] a month for one publisher, another for a second publisher, and the equivalent of another book for a magazine... He was writing a quarter of a million words a month&quot; under many different pseudonyms including about 200 erotic novels published as Don Elliott. In a 2000 interview, Silverberg explained that the erotic fiction &quot;... was undertaken at a time when I was saddled with a huge debt, at the age of 26, for a splendid house that I had bought. There would have been no way to pay the house off by writing science fiction ... so I turned out a slew of quick sex novels. I never concealed the fact that I was doing them; it made no difference at all to me whether people knew or not. It was just a job. And it was, incidentally, a job that I did very well. I think they were outstanding erotic novels.&quot;

===Literary growth===
In the mid-1960s, many writers in science fiction were moving away from the adventure, hard science fiction and space opera themes that often characterized the early years of the genre, and writing stories with greater literary ambitions, psychological sophistication and experimental methods (see New Wave science fiction). Frederik Pohl, then editing three science fiction magazines, offered Silverberg creative freedom in writing for them. Thus inspired, Silverberg returned to the field that gave him his start, paying far more attention to depth of character development and social background than he had in the past and mixing in elements of the modernist literature he had studied at Columbia.

Silverberg continued to write rapidly—Algis Budrys reported in 1965 that he wrote and sold at least 50,000 words (&quot;call it the equivalent of a commercial novel&quot;) weekly—but the novels he wrote in this period are considered superior to his earlier work; Budrys in 1968 wrote of his surprise that &quot;Silverberg is now writing deeply detailed, highly educated, beautifully figured books&quot; like &quot;Thorns&quot; and &quot;The Masks of Time&quot;. Perhaps the first book to indicate the new Silverberg was &quot;To Open the Sky&quot;, a fixup of stories published by Pohl in &quot;Galaxy Magazine&quot;, in which a new religion helps people reach the stars. That was followed by &quot;Downward to the Earth&quot;, a story containing echoes of material from Joseph Conrad&#x27;s work, in which the human former administrator of an alien world returns after the planet&#x27;s inhabitants have been set free. Other acclaimed works of that time include &quot;To Live Again&quot;, in which the memories and personalities of the deceased can be transferred to other people; &quot;The World Inside&quot;, a look at an overpopulated future; and &quot;Dying Inside&quot;, a tale of a telepath losing his powers.

In the August 1967 issue of &quot;Galaxy&quot;, Silverberg published a 20,000-word novelette called &quot;Hawksbill Station&quot;. This story earned Silverberg his first Hugo and Nebula story award nominations. An expanded novel form of &quot;Hawksbill Station&quot; was published the following year. In 1969 &quot;Nightwings&quot; was awarded the Hugo for best novella. Silverberg won a Nebula award in 1970 for the short story &quot;Passengers&quot;, two the following year for his novel &quot;A Time of Changes&quot; and the short story &quot;Good News from the Vatican&quot;, and yet another in 1975 for his novella &quot;Born with the Dead&quot;.

===Later developments===
After suffering through the stresses of a major house fire and a thyroid malfunction, Silverberg moved from his native New York City to the West Coast in 1972, and he announced his retirement from writing in 1975. In 1980 he returned, however, with &quot;Lord Valentine&#x27;s Castle&quot;, a panoramic adventure set on an alien planet, which has become the basis of the Majipoor series—a cycle of stories and novels set on the vast planet Majipoor, a world much larger than Earth and inhabited by no fewer than seven different species of settlers. In a 2015 interview Silverberg said that he did not intend to write any more fiction.

Silverberg received a Nebula award in 1986 for the novella &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;, which takes its name from the poem by William Butler Yeats; a Hugo in 1987 for the novella &quot;Gilgamesh in the Outback&quot;, set in the &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot; universe of Bangsian Fantasy; a Hugo in 1990 for &quot;Enter a Soldier. Later: Enter Another&quot;. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Silverberg in 1999, its fourth class of two deceased and two living writers, and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made him its 21st SFWA Grand Master in 2005.

==Personal life==
Silverberg has been married twice. He and Barbara Brown married in 1956, separated in 1976 and divorced a decade later. Silverberg and science fiction writer Karen Haber married in 1987. They live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Before the age of 30, Silverberg was independently wealthy through his investments, and once owned the former mansion of New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.

<text>Kayseri () is a large city in Central Anatolia, Turkey, and the capital of Kayseri province. Historically known as Caesarea, it has been the historical capital of Cappadocia since ancient times. The Kayseri Metropolitan Municipality area is composed of five districts: the two central districts of Kocasinan and Melikgazi, and since 2004, also outlying Hacılar, İncesu, and Talas.

As of 31 December 2021, the province had a population of 1,434,357 of whom 1,175,886 live in the four urban districts, excluding İncesu which is not conurbated, meaning it is not contiguous and has a largely non-protected buffer zone.

Kayseri sits at the foot of Mount Erciyes (Turkish: &quot;Erciyes Dağı&quot;), a dormant volcano that reaches an altitude of , more than 1,500 metres above the city&#x27;s mean altitude. It contains a number of historic monuments, particularly from the Seljuk period. Tourists often pass through Kayseri en route to the attractions of Cappadocia to the west.

Kayseri is served by Erkilet International Airport and is home to Erciyes University.

== Etymology ==
Kayseri has been equated with the early Hittite kingdom of Kussara, referenced sporadically in early Assyrian trading records. It was called &quot;Mazaka&quot; or &quot;Mazaca&quot; (; according to Armenian tradition, it was founded by and named after Mishak) and was known as such to the geographer Strabo, during whose time it was the capital of the Roman province of Cappadocia, known also as &quot;Eusebia at the Argaeus&quot; ( in Greek), after Ariarathes V Eusebes, King of Cappadocia (r. 163–130 BC).

In 14 AD its name was changed by Archelaus (d. 17 AD), the last King of Cappadocia (r. 36 BC–14 AD) and a Roman vassal, to &quot;Caesarea in Cappadocia&quot; (to distinguish it from other cities with the name &quot;Caesarea&quot; in the Roman Empire) in honour of Caesar Augustus upon his death. This name was rendered as (&quot;Kaisáreia&quot;) in Koine Greek, the dialect of the later Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and it remained in use by the natives (nowadays known as Cappadocian Greeks, due to their spoken language, but then referred to as Rum due to their previous Roman citizenship) until their expulsion from Turkey in 1924. (Note that letter &quot;C&quot; in classical Latin was pronounced &quot;K.&quot; This pronunciation was adapted by the Arabs, who called the city &quot;Kaisariyah&quot; (), and the Turks, who gave the city its current name &quot;Kayseri&quot; ()).

==History==
Kayseri experienced three golden ages. The first, dating to 2000 BC, was when the city formed a trade post between the Assyrians and the Hittites. The second came under Roman rule from the 1st to the 11th centuries. The third golden age was during the reign of the Seljuks (1178–1243), when the city was the second capital of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum.

===Ancient history===

As Mazaca (), the city served as the residence of the kings of Cappadocia. In ancient times, it was on the crossroads of the trade routes from Sinope to the Euphrates and from the Persian Royal Road that extended from Sardis to Susa during the 200+ years of Achaemenid Persian rule. In Roman times, a similar route from Ephesus to the East also crossed the city.

In Late Antiquity, the city may have contained a population of around 50,000 inhabitants and it was the highest ranked diocese up to the council of Chalcedon. Nothing remains of it today. 
Basil of Caesarea, one of the Cappadocian Fathers, established a large complex containing charitable institutions, a monastery and churches, the Basiliad, in Caesarea Mazaca in the fourth century. Nothing remains of it today.

The city was also situated on the main pilgrimage route from Constantinople to the Holy Land and had several shrines dedicated to local saints, such as St Mamas, St Merkourious and Basil of Caesarea, which continued to be venerated by the local population into the 17th century. The city was occupied by the Sassanids in 611/12 in the last war between the Byzantines and the Sassanids and became the headquarter of emperor Heraclius.

The city stood on a low spur on the north side of Mount Erciyes (&quot;Mount Argaeus&quot; in antiquity). Very few traces of the ancient site now survive.

===Medieval history===
From the mid-seventh century onwards, Arab attacks on Cappadocia and Caesarea became common and the city was besieged several times, diminishing in population and resources consequently. The Arab general, and later the first Umayyad Caliph, Muawiyah invaded Cappadocia and took Caesarea from the Byzantines temporarily in 647. By the mid-eight century, the area between Caesarea and Melitene was a no-mans land.

Though the city lost most of its importance by the tenth century, is housed probably still around 50,000 people. Alp Arslan&#x27;s forces demolished the city and massacred its population in 1067. The shrine of Saint Basil was also sacked after the fall of the city. As a result, the city remained uninhabited for the next half century.

From 1074 to 1178 the area was under the control of the Danishmendids who rebuilt the city in 1134. The Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate controlled the city from 1178 to 1243 and it was one of their most important centres until it fell to the Mongols in 1243. The relatively short Seljuk period left a large number of historic landmarks including the Hunat Hatun Complex, the Kiliç Arslan Mosque, the &quot;Ulu Camii&quot; (Grand Mosque) and the &quot;Gevher Nesibe Hastanesi&quot; (Hospital). Within the walls lies the greater part of Kayseri, rebuilt between the 13th and 16th centuries. The city then fell to the Eretnids before finally becoming Ottoman in 1515. It was the centre of a sanjak called initially the Rum Eyalet (1515–1521) and then the Angora vilayet (founded as Bozok Eyalet, 1839–1923).

===Modern era===

The Grand Bazaar dates from the latter part of the 1800s, but the adjacent caravanserai, where merchant traders gathered before forming a caravan, dates from around 1500. The town&#x27;s older districts which were filled with ornate mansion-houses mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries were subjected to wholesale demolition starting in the 1970s.

The building that hosted the Kayseri Lyceum was rearranged to host the Turkish Grand National Assembly during the Turkish War of Independence when the Greek army was advancing on Ankara, the base of the Turkish National Movement.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Kayseri has a continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;). It experiences cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers with cool nights. Precipitation occurs throughout the year, albeit with a marked decrease in late summer and early fall.

==Political structure==
The city of Kayseri consists of sixteen metropolitan districts: Akkışla, Bünyan, Develi, Felâhiye, Hacılar, İncesu, Kocasinan, Melikgâzi, Özvatan, Pınarbaşı, Sarıoğlan, Sarız, Talas, Tomarza, Yahyâlı, and Yeşilhisar.

== Local attractions ==

=== In Kayseri ===
Kayseri features a range of historical and cultural attractions that reflect the city&#x27;s heritage. Cumhuriyet Square is a central public space in Kayseri, surrounded by notable buildings. Inside the centre of Kayseri the most unmissable reminder of the past are the huge basalt walls that once enclosed the old city. Dating back to the sixth century and the reign of the Emperor Justinian, they have been repeatedly repaired, by the Seljuks, by the Ottomans and more recently by the current Turkish government. In 2019 Kayseri Archaeology Museum moved from an outlying location to a new site inside the walls. Kayseri Clock Tower, built in the early 20th century by Abdülhamid II, is located in the city center and remains a recognizable landmark. Bürüngüz Mosque, constructed in the 13th century, is an example of Seljuk architecture and is still in use today.

Surp Asdvadzadzin Virgin Mary Church Research Library, located within the Surp Asdvadzadzin Church. The Atatürk House Museum is located in a house where Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stayed, providing historical context about the early years of the Turkish Republic. The National Struggle Museum focuses on the history of the Turkish War of Independence and the role of Kayseri in the formation of the modern Turkish state.

The Grand Mosque (Turkish: &quot;Ulu Cami&quot;) was started by the Danişmend emir Melik Mehmed Gazi who is buried beside it although it was only completed by the Seljuks after his death. There are many magnificent reminders of the Seljuk supremacy in and around the walls as well as many much smaller &quot;kümbets&quot; (domed tombs) of which the most impressive is the Döner Kümbet (&quot;lit.&quot; Revolving Tomb). The oldest surviving Seljuk place of worship – and the oldest Seljuk mosque built in Turkey – is the Hunat Hatun Mosque Complex which still includes a functioning hamam with separate sections for men and women dating back to 1238.

Near the mosque is the Sahabiye Medresesi, a theological school dating back to 1267 with a magnificent portal typical of Seljuk architecture. Very similar is the Avgunlu Medresesi which now serves as a large bookshop-cum-cafe in a park. In Mimar Sinan Park stands the Çifte Medresesi, a pair of Seljuk-era theological schools that eventually served as a hospital for those with psychiatric disorders. They were commissioned by the Seljuk sultan Giyasettin I Keyhüsrev and his sister, Gevher Nesibe Sultan, who is buried inside. Today the buildings house the Museum of Seljuk Civilisations.

Another Seljuk survivor is the grand Halikılıç Mosque complex which has two spectacular entrance portals. It dates back to 1249 but was extensively restored three centuries later. Post-dating the Seljuks is the Güpgüpoğlu Mansion which dates back to the early 15th century but is open to the public with the furnishings it would have had in the late 19th century when it was home to the poet and politician Ahmed Midhad Güpgüpoğlu.

Close to the walls is Kayseri&#x27;s own Kapalı Çarşı (Turkish: &quot;Kapalı Çarşı&quot;), still a bustling commercial centre selling cheap clothes, shoes and much else. Deep inside it is the older and very atmospheric Vezir Han which was commissioned in the early 18th century by Nevşehir-born Damad İbrahim Paşa who became a grand vizier to Sultan Ahmed III before being assassinated in 1730.

=== Around Kayseri ===
The Kayseri suburb of Talas was the ancestral home of Calouste Gulbenkian, Aristotle Onassis and Elia Kazan. Once ruinous following the expulsion of its Armenian population in 1915 and then of its Greek population in 1923, it was largely reconstructed in the early 21st century. The Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Mary, built in 1888, has been converted into the Yaman Dede Mosque. Similarly attractive is the suburb of Germir, home to three 19th-century churches and many fine old stone houses.

Mount Erciyes (Turkish: &quot;Erciyes Dağı&quot;) looms over Kayseri and serves as a trekking and alpinism centre. During the 2010s an erstwhile small, local ski resort was developed into more of an international attraction with big-name hotels and facilities suitable for all sorts of winter pastimes.

The archaeological site of Kanesh-Kültepe, one of the oldest cities in Asia Minor, is 20 km northeast of Kayseri.

Ağırnas, a small town with many lovely old houses, was the birthplace in 1490 of the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, and a house traditionally associated with him is open to the public as a museum. Beneath it there is one of the &#x27;underground cities&#x27; so typical of Cappadocia. The restored Church of Saint Procopius dates back to 1857 and serves as a cultural centre.

The small town of Develi also contains some attractive old houses. The 19th-century Armenian Church of Saint Mary has been turned into the Lower Everek Mosque (Turkish: &quot;Aşağı Everek Cami&quot;).

==Economy==
Kayseri received notable public investments in the 1920s and 1930s. Sümer Fabric Factory and &quot;Kayseri Tayyare Fabrikası&quot; (English: Kayseri Aeroplane Factory) were set up here in the Republican Era with the help of German and particularly Russian experts. The latter manufactured the first aircraft &quot;made in Turkey&quot; in the 1940s. After the 1950s, the city suffered from a decrease in the amount of public investment. It was, however, during the same years that Kayseri businessmen and merchants transformed themselves into rural capitalists. Members of Turkish business families such as Sabancı, Has, Dedeman, Hattat, Kurmel, Özyeğin, Karamanlargil and Özilhan started out as small-scale merchants in Kayseri before becoming prominent actors in the Turkish economy. Despite setting up their headquarters in cities such as Istanbul and Adana, they often returned to Kayseri to invest.

Thanks to the economic liberalisation policies introduced in the 1980s, a new wave of merchants and industrialists from Kayseri joined their predecessors. Most of these new industrialists choose Kayseri as a base of their operations. As a consequence of better infrastructure, the city has achieved remarkable industrial growth since 2000, causing it to be described as one of Turkey&#x27;s Anatolian Tigers.

The pace of growth of the city was so fast that in 2004 the city applied to the Guinness Book of World Records for the most new manufacturing industries started in a single day: 139 factories. Kayseri also has emerged as one of the most successful furniture-making hub in Turkey earned more than a billion dollars in export revenues in 2007. Its environment is regarded as especially favourable for small and medium enterprises.

Kayseri Free Zone established in 1998 now has more than 43 companies with an investment of 140 million dollars. The Zone&#x27;s main business activities include production, trading, warehouse management, mounting and demounting, assembly-disassembly, merchandising, maintenance and repair, engineering workshops, office and workplace rental, packing-repacking, banking and insurance, leasing, labelling and exhibition facilities. Kayseri FTZ is one of the cheapest land free zones in the world.

A group of social scientists have traced the economic success of Kayseri, a city in central Turkey, to a modernist Islamic outlook referred to as &quot;Islamic Calvinism.&quot; This concept is drawn from Max Weber&#x27;s influential 1905 essay, &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;, which argued that the &quot;this-worldly asceticism&quot; of Calvinism was the driving force behind the development of modern capitalism. In a similar vein, these scholars suggest that the religious and cultural practices in Kayseri, rooted in a modern interpretation of Islam, fostered values such as hard work, thrift, and entrepreneurial spirit, which contributed to the city&#x27;s economic growth. In Kayseri, a notable characteristic of the local culture is a form of austerity, which can be observed alongside a strong work ethic. According to an op-ed in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;The city&#x27;s streets are not crowded with luxury cars, and the homes in its wealthiest neighborhoods are relatively modest compared to European standards. Rather than conspicuous consumption, wealth is often reinvested into the community.&quot; Philanthropy plays an important role in the city, aligning with the Islamic emphasis on charity. Kayseri is known for its privately funded institutions, including schools, clinics, sports facilities, and community centers, reflecting a focus on communal support and development.

==Transport==
The city is served by Erkilet International Airport (ASR) which is a short distance from the centre of Kayseri. It offers several flights a day to Istanbul.

Kayseri is connected to the rest of country by rail services. There are four trains a day to Ankara. To the east there are two train routes, one to Kars and the other to Tatvan at the western end of Lake Van.

As the city is located in central Turkey, road transportation is very efficient. It takes approximately three hours to reach Ankara, the same to the Mediterranean coast and 45 minutes to Cappadocia. A notable ski resort in winter and accessible for trekking in summer, Mt Erciyes is 30 minutes from the city centre.

Within the city transportation largely relies on buses and private vehicles although there is also a light rail transit (LRT) system called Kayseray which runs to the inter-city bus terminal and to Talas.

==Sports==
The city had two professional football teams competing in top-flight Turkish football. Kayserispor and Kayseri Erciyesspor simultaneously play in the Süper Lig, making Kayseri one of only two cities having more than one team in Spor Toto Süper Lig 2013–14 (the other being Istanbul).

==Cuisine==
Kayseri&#x27;s cuisine includes several traditional dishes that are characteristic of the region. Mantı, a small dumpling filled with minced meat and commonly served with yogurt and spiced butter, is one of the city&#x27;s signature dishes. Known for its fine preparation, Kayseri-style mantı is distinguished by the small size of the dumplings. Pastırma is a type of air-dried, cured beef, seasoned with a paste made from garlic, fenugreek, and spices. It is often thinly sliced and served as an appetizer or used in other dishes. Sucuk, a dry, fermented sausage made from ground beef and seasoned with garlic and red pepper, is another popular specialty in the region and is commonly included in breakfasts or cooked with eggs.

Stuffed zucchini flowers are a seasonal dish prepared with a filling of minced meat, garlic, and spices. The flowers are carefully stuffed and then baked or steamed. This dish highlights the use of locally sourced ingredients in Kayseri&#x27;s cuisine. Nevzine is a traditional dessert made from tahini, molasses, and walnuts, soaked in syrup. This dessert is typically prepared for special occasions and is notable for its dense texture and flavor profile.

<text>MLDonkey is an open-source, multi-protocol, peer-to-peer file sharing application that runs as a back-end server application on many platforms. It can be controlled through a user interface provided by one of many separate front-ends, including a Web interface, telnet interface and over a dozen native client programs.

Originally a Linux client for the eDonkey protocol, it now runs on many flavors of Unix-like, OS X, Microsoft Windows and MorphOS and supports numerous peer-to-peer protocols.

It is written in OCaml, with some C and some assembly.

== History ==
Development of the software began in late 2001. The original developer of MLDonkey is Fabrice Le Fessant from INRIA. It was originally conceived as an effort to spread the use of OCaml in the open source community.

In January 2003, Slyck.com reported brief friction between MLDonkey developers and the official Overnet MetaMachine developers, which denounced MLDonkey as a &quot;rogue client&quot;, allegedly for incorrect behavior on the network.

Versions before 3.0 have a known security vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the web interface to read any file on the file system.

== Features ==
Features of MLdonkey core:
* Peer to peer (p2p) program that supports the following network protocols, either partially or completely:
** FastTrack (Kazaa)
** eDonkey network (with Overnet and Kad network)
** BitTorrent (with Mainline DHT)
** Direct Connect
** HTTP/FTP
* Multiple control interfaces: telnet, web interface, third party GUIs.

Written in the OCaml programming language and licensed under the GPL-2.0-or-later license, the application separates the user interface (which can be a web browser, telnet, or a third-party GUI application) and the code that interacts with the peer-to-peer networks.

MLDonkey is able to connect simultaneously to different peers using different network protocols. In addition it can download and merge parts of one file from different network protocols although this feature is currently documented as experimental. MLDonkey runs in a terminal session and does not require a GUI environment, saving memory and processing resources. Behavior is controlled by editable configuration files, or—in a more user friendly fashion—from a separate user interface.

From release 2.9.0 (2007) on, support for gnutella and G2 are no longer compiled in by default as both plugins are buggy and currently unmaintained; however, it is still possible to compile them in by making the appropriate setting in the configuration file.
