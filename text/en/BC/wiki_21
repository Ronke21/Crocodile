<text>The music of Guadeloupe encompasses a large popular music industry, which gained in international renown after the success of zouk music in the later 20th century. Zouk&#x27;s popularity was particularly intense in France, where the genre became an important symbol of identity for Guadeloupe and Martinique. Zouk&#x27;s origins are in the folk music of Guadeloupe and Martinique, especially Guadeloupan gwo ka and Martinican chouval bwa, and the pan-Caribbean calypso tradition.

==Folk music==
Carnival is a very important festival in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Music plays a vital role, with Guadeloupean gwo ka ensembles, zouk music and guadeloupean big bands marching across the island, and travelling and performing music known as C (or just &quot;videé&quot;) in a manner akin to Brazilian samba schools. Carnival in both islands declined following World War II, bouncing back with new band formats and new traditions only in the 1980s. Both islands feature participatory, call-and-response style songs during their Carnival celebrations.

===Biguine vidé===
Biguine vidé is an up tempo version of the biguine rhythm, combining other carnival elements. It is participatory music, with the bandleader singing a verse and the audience responding. It allows one to grab an improvised percussion instrument and join in. Traditionally, Carnival includes dances of African origin, including laghia, haut-taille, grage, calinda and bel-air. Traditional instruments include the chacha, tibwa, maké, boula, tanbou chan and tanbou bas drums. Aside from the biguine vidé bands, Vaval includes song and costume contests, masquerading and zouk parties.

===Gwo ka===
Gwo ka is a family of hand drums used to create a form of folk music from Guadeloupe. There are seven basic rhythms in gwo ka, and multiple variations on each. Different sizes of drums establish the foundation and its flourishes, with the largest, the &quot;boula&quot;, playing the central rhythm and the smaller, &quot;markeur&quot; (or &quot;maké&quot;) drums embellishes upon it and interplays with the dancers, audience or singer. Gwo ka singing is usually guttural, nasal and rough, though it can also be bright and smooth, and is accompanied by uplifting and complex harmonies and melodies.

Rural Guadeloupans still use gwo ka drums in communal experiences called lewozes; this is the most traditional manifestation of gwo ka in modern Guadeloupe. Gwo ka is also played at Carnival and other celebrations. A modernized and popularized form of gwo ka is well known on the islands; it is known as &quot;gwo ka moderne&quot;.

===Balakadri===

Guadeloupean balakadri persisted into the 20th century and, despite disruption after World War II, made a comeback in the 1980s. The Guadeloupean-administered island of Marie-Galante has also had a vital and well-documented balakadri tradition. As in Martinique (and the Creole-speaking islands of Saint Lucia and Dominica), kwadril dances are in sets consisting of proper quadrilles, plus creolized versions of 19th-century couple dances: biguines, mazouks and valses Créoles.

== Popular music ==

Though Guadeloupe and Martinique are most frequently known only for the internationally renowned zouk style, the islands have also produced popular musicians in various updated styles of traditional biguine, chouval bwa and gwo ka. The world-famous zouk band Kassav&#x27; remains easily the most famous performers from the island, while the Guadeloupan Carnival band Akiyo has become the only group in that style to record commercially.

===Cadence (Kadans)/Compas===

In the 1970s, a wave of Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (Guadeloupe and Martinique) brought with them the kadans, a sophisticated form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de Guadeloupe.

Later in the decade and into the 1980s, the French Antilles became home to a style of cadence music called cadence-lypso. Gordon Henderson&#x27;s Exile One innovated this style, as well as turned the mini-jazz combos into guitar-dominated big bands with a full-horn section and the newly arrived synthesizers, paving the way for the success of large groups like Grammacks, Experience 7, among others. Drawing on these influences, the supergroup Kassav&#x27; invented zouk and popularized it with hit songs like &quot;Zouk-La-Se Sel Medikaman Nou Ni&quot;. Kassav&#x27; formed from Paris in 1978.

===Mini-jazz===
Mini-jazz was formed in the mid-60s characterized by the rock bands formula of two guitars, one bass, drum-conga-cowbell, some use an alto sax or a full horn section, others use a keyboard, accordion or lead guitar. However, all these small jazz or bands had their guitars with sophisticated styles. The 1970s were dominated by mini-jazz, which still used a variant of the méringue style. One of the mini-jazz groups, Tabou Combo, became the most popular ensemble of Haiti. From Haiti the mini-jazz formula replicated in the French Antilles in the 1970s.

===Cadence-lypso===

The most influential figure in the promotion of Cadence-lypso was the Dominican group Exile One (based on the island of Guadeloupe) that featured mostly the cadence rampa of Haiti and calypso music from the English speaking caribbean. It was pushed in the 1970s by groups from Dominica, and was the first style of Dominican music to find international acclaim.

Dominica cadence music has evolved under the influence of Dominican and Caribbean/Latin rhythms, as well as rock and roll, soul, and funk music from the United States.
By the end of the 1970s, Gordon Henderson defined Cadence-lypso as &quot;a synthesis of Caribbean and African musical patterns fusing the traditional with the contemporary&quot;.

Aside from Exile One, other bands included the Grammacks, Black Roots, Black Machine, Naked Feet, Belles Combo, Mantra, Black Affairs, Liquid Ice, Wafrikai, Midnighte Groovers and Milestone, while the most famous singers included Bill Thomas, Chubby Marc, Gordon Henderson, Linford John, Janet Azouz, Sinky Rabess, Tony Valmond, Jeff Joseph, Mike Moreau, Anthony Gussie and Ophelia Marie.

===Zouk===
The inspiration for Zouk&#x27;s style of rhythmic music comes from the Haitian compas, as well as music called cadence-lypso - Dominica cadence popularized by Grammacks and Exile One. Elements of gwo ka, tambour, ti bwa and biguine vidé are prominent in zouk. Though there are many diverse styles of zouk, some commonalities exist. The French Creole tongue of Martinique and Guadeloupe is an important element, and are a distinctive part of the music. Generally, zouk is based around star singers, with little attention given to instrumentalists, and is based almost entirely around studio recordings.

Music authors Charles De Ledesma and Gene Scaramuzzo trace zouk&#x27;s development to the Guadeloupean gwo ka and Martinican bèlè (&quot;tambour&quot; and &quot;ti bwa&quot;)
folk traditions. Ethnomusicologist Jocelyne Guilbault, however, describes zouk as a synthesis of Caribbean popular styles, especially Dominica cadence-lypso, Haitian cadence, Guadeloupean &quot;biguine&quot;. Zouk arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s, using elements of previous styles of Antillean music, as well as imported genres.

===Zouk-love===
Zouk Love is the French Antilles cadence or compas, characterized by a slow, soft and sexual rhythm. The lyrics of the songs often speak of love and sentimental problems.

The music kizomba from Angola and cabo-love from Cape Verde are also derivatives of this French Antillean compas style, which sounds basically the same, although there are notable differences once you become more familiar with these genres. A main exponent of this subgenre is Ophelia Marie. Other Zouk Love artists come from the French West Indies, the Netherlands, and Africa.
Popular artists include French West Indian artists Edith Lefel and Nichols, or like Netherlands based Suzanna Lubrano and Gil Semedo, the African artist Kaysha.

=== Gwo ka moderne ===
A more modernized version of gwo ka is &quot;gwo ka moderne&quot;, which adds new instruments ranging from conga or djembe drums and chimes to electric bass guitar. At root, however, these styles all use the same fundamental seven rhythms as folk gwo ka. Zouk legends Kassav&#x27; played an important role in the modernization of gwo ka, giving urban credibility to a style that was seen as backward and unsophisticated; they initially played in a gro ka format, using songs from the gwo ka Carnival tradition of &quot;mas a St. Jean&quot; and even placing an homage to traditionalist drumming legend Velo on their earlier albums.

Gwo ka moderne artists include Pakala Percussion, Van Lévé and Poukoutan&#x27;n, alongside more pop-influenced musicians like Marcel Magnat and Ti Celeste, while Gerard Hubert and others have fused gwo ka with zouk. The most famous modern gwo ka performer, however, is William Flessel, whose &quot;Message Ka&quot; in 1994 became an international hit.

===Bouyon gwada===

Bouyon (Boo-Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988 by experimenting with a fusion of cadence-lypso, jing ping and other traditional dances.

Due to the popularity of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles, a popular offshoot of bouyon from Guadeloupe is called bouyon gwada.
The jump up had its heyday from the 90s with songs such as Met Veye WCK, but remained stamped background music or carnival. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and &quot;Big Ting Poppin &#x27;Daly alone.

A popular offshoot within the bouyon gwada is called bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc.

===French Antilles hip hop===

The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France.&#x27;

Sidney Duteil (born Patrick Duteil in 1955 in Argenteuil, Val-d&#x27;Oise), better known as Sidney, is a French musician, rapper, DJ, television and radio host, and occasional actor of Guadeloupean origin. He is well known in France for his connection with the beginnings of the French hip hop scene.

<text>John Paul Corigliano (born February 16, 1938) is an American composer of contemporary classical music. With over 100 compositions, he has won accolades including a Pulitzer Prize, five Grammy Awards, Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, and an Academy Award.

He is a former distinguished professor of music at Lehman College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and part of the composition faculty at the Juilliard School. Corigliano is best known for his Symphony No. 1, a response to the AIDS epidemic, and his film score for François Girard&#x27;s &quot;The Red Violin&quot; (1997), which he subsequently adapted as the 2003 Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (&quot;The Red Violin&quot;) for Joshua Bell.

==Biography==

===Before 1964===
Corigliano was born in New York City to a musical family. His Italian-American father, John Paul Corigliano Sr., was concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic for 23 years. Corigliano&#x27;s mother, Rose Buzen, an educator and pianist, was Jewish.

He attended P.S. 241 and Midwood High School in Brooklyn. He studied composition at Columbia University (BA 1959) and at the Manhattan School of Music. He studied with Otto Luening, Vittorio Giannini, and Paul Creston. Before achieving success as a composer, Corigliano worked as assistant to the producer on the Leonard Bernstein &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot; and as a session producer for classical artists such as André Watts. He was also music director for New York&#x27;s listener-sponsored radio station WBAI.

===1964–1987===
Corigliano first came to prominence in 1964 at the age of 26 when his Sonata for Violin and Piano (1963) was the only winner of the chamber-music competition of the Spoleto Festival in Italy. In 1970, Corigliano teamed up with David Hess to create &quot;The Naked Carmen&quot;. In a recent communication with David Hess, Hess acknowledged that &quot;The Naked Carmen&quot; was originally conceived by Corigliano and himself as a way to update the most popular opera of our time (&quot;Carmen&quot;). Mercury Records wanted the classical and popular divisions to work together and after a meeting with Joe Bott, Scott Mampe and Bob Reno, it was decided to proceed with the project. In Hess&#x27;s own words, the project was &quot;a collective decision&quot;.

After he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, Corigliano began teaching at the Manhattan School of Music and became a music faculty member at Lehman College. He credits his first two concerti for solo wind for both changing his art and his career. It was during the composition of his Oboe Concerto (1975) and especially his Clarinet Concerto (1977) that he first used an &quot;architectural&quot; method of composing.

In 1974, he wrote his first film score for the documentary &quot;A Williamsburg Sampler&quot;. He later wrote the score for &quot;Altered States&quot; (1980) for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The award-winning score for &quot;Revolution&quot; (1985), his third film, is one of Corigliano&#x27;s most impressive creations, although it is less known, as it was never released in any recorded format; it has existed in a bootleg form until Varèse Sarabande officially released the score for a limited time in December 2009 through their CD club, and then as a regular release in 2010. Corigliano later used portions of the score in his first symphony.

He composed for flutist James Galway his third wind concerto, titled &quot;Pied Piper Fantasy&quot;, which premiered with the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1982). In 1984, he became distinguished professor of music at Lehman College and left his position at Manhattan School of Music in 1986.

===1987–present===
In 1987, Corigliano was the first composer to serve as composer-in-residence for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. During his residency, he composed his first symphony, which was inspired by the AIDS epidemic and to honor the friends he lost. His first symphony won him the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1991 and his first Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 1992.

Corigliano&#x27;s first opera, &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot;, was the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s first commission in nearly three decades, celebrating the company&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The opera was a huge success at the premiere and received the International Classical Music Awards Composition of the Year award in 1992. In 1991, Corigliano became faculty member at the Juilliard School. In 1995, he was commissioned by Lincoln Center to write a string quartet for the Cleveland Quartet, which won him his second Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Classical Composition. Corigliano&#x27;s fourth film score was for François Girard&#x27;s &quot;The Red Violin&quot; (1997) which won him his second Academy Award nomination and the 1999 Oscar for best film score. Portions of the score were used in his violin concerto (2003), written for Joshua Bell, who premiered it on September 19, 2003, with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. In 2001, he received the Pulitzer Prize for his Symphony No. 2 (2001).

In 2011, Corigliano&#x27;s song cycle &quot;One Sweet Morning&quot; premiered at Avery Fisher Hall by mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe and the New York Philharmonic, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Other important commissions have been &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot; (1997) for two pianos tuned a quarter tone apart for The Dranoff International Two Piano Foundation, &quot;Vocalise&quot; (1999) for the New York Philharmonic, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan&quot; (2003) which earned him his third Grammy Award, Symphony No. 3 &quot;Circus Maximus&quot; (2004) for the University of Texas Wind Ensemble, &quot;STOMP&quot; (2011) written for the 2011 Tchaikovsky Competition in Russia, and &quot;Conjurer&quot; (2008) commissioned by an international consortium of six orchestras for percussionist Evelyn Glennie and winning him his fifth Grammy Award.

Among Corigliano&#x27;s students are David Sampson, Eric Whitacre, Elliot Goldenthal, Edward Knight, Nico Muhly, Roger Bergs, Michael Gilbertson, Gary Kulesha, Scott Glasgow, John Mackey, Michael Bacon, Avner Dorman, Mason Bates, Steven Bryant, Jefferson Friedman, Jamie Howarth, Dinuk Wijeratne and David Ludwig. In 1996, The Corigliano Quartet was founded, taking his name in tribute.

==Music==
Most of Corigliano&#x27;s work has been for symphony orchestra. He employs a wide variety of styles, sometimes even within the same work, but aims to make his work accessible to a large audience. Many of his works have been performed and recorded by some of the most prominent orchestras, soloists, and chamber musicians in the world. He has written symphonies, as well as works for string orchestra, wind band, concerti, chamber and solo pieces, opera, as well as for film.

Corigliano&#x27;s most distinguished works include his Clarinet Concerto (1977), Symphony No. 1 (1988), &quot;The Ghosts of Versailles&quot; (1991), Symphony No. 2 for string orchestra (2000), &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man: Seven Poems of Bob Dylan&quot; (2000), and his score for the film &quot;The Red Violin&quot; (1998). His clarinet concerto is the first by an American composer to have entered the standard repertoire since Aaron Copland&#x27;s clarinet concerto.

<doc id="242964" wikidata="Q3868888" url="?curid=242964" title="My Old Kentucky Home (1926 film)">
<text>My Old Kentucky Home is a short animation film originally released in June 1926, by Max and Dave Fleischer of Fleischer Studios as one of the Song Car-Tunes series. The series, between May 1924 and September 1926, eventually totaled 36 films, of which 19 were made with sound. This cartoon features the original lyrics of &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; (1853) by Stephen Foster, and was recorded in the Lee de Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system.

&quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; appears to be the first attempt at animated dialogue in cartoon history, as an unnamed dog, an early prototype of future studio mascot Bimbo, in the film mouths the words &quot;Follow the ball, and join in, everybody&quot; in remarkable synchronization though the animation was somewhat limited, making sure that lip-synch was synchronized perfectly. The Fleischers had previously started the follow the bouncing ball gimmick in their Song Car-Tune &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean&quot; (released on September 15, 1925).

This film came two years after the Fleischers started the Song Car-Tune series in May 1924.

==Reception==
&quot;Motion Picture News&quot; (March 23, 1926): &quot;The old familiar favorite &#x27;My Old Kentucky Home&#x27; furnishes the subject for this Max Fleischer Song Car-Tune. The verses are shown in the usual manner and the comedy handling of the chorus shows a darky girl leaping from word to word doing stunts... This should prove one of the most popular of the series&quot;.

&quot;The Film Daily&quot; (March 28, 1926): &quot;Ko-Ko and his quartet render this time the old southern classic &#x27;My Old Kentucky Home&#x27;, with the help of the audience of course. Fleischer has a new instruction for the opening, showing the quartet as a band marching and playing, and winding up on the stage of the theatre. There is always a humorous touch added to the chorus of the song. This time in the shape of a little pickaninny who dances along on top of the words&quot;.

==In popular culture==
A clip from the film is used in the opening credits of the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?&quot;

<text>Radcliffe College was a women&#x27;s liberal arts college in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that was founded in 1879. In 1999, it was fully incorporated into Harvard College. The college was named for the early Harvard benefactor Anne Mowlson (née Radcliffe) and was one of the Seven Sisters colleges.

For the first 70 years of its existence, Radcliffe conferred undergraduate and graduate degrees. Beginning in 1963, it awarded joint Harvard-Radcliffe diplomas to undergraduates. In 1977, Radcliffe signed a formal &quot;non-merger merger&quot; agreement with Harvard, and completed a full integration with Harvard in 1999. 

Within Harvard University, Radcliffe&#x27;s former administrative campus, Radcliffe Yard, is home to the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Former Radcliffe housing at the Radcliffe Quadrangle, including Pforzheimer House, Cabot House, and Currier House, has been incorporated into Harvard College&#x27;s house system. Under the terms of the 1999 consolidation, Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle retain the &quot;Radcliffe&quot; designation in perpetuity.

==History==
===19th century===

The &quot;Harvard Annex,&quot; a private program for the instruction of women by Harvard faculty, was founded in 1879 after prolonged efforts by women to gain access to Harvard College. Arthur Gilman, a Cambridge resident, banker, philanthropist and writer, was the founder of what became The Annex/Radcliffe. At a time when higher education for women was a sharply controversial topic, Gilman hoped to establish a higher educational opportunity for his daughter that exceeded what was generally available in female seminaries and the new women&#x27;s colleges such as Vassar and Wellesley. These schools were in their early years and had substantial numbers of faculty who were not university trained. 

In conversations with the chair of Harvard College&#x27;s classics department, Gilman outlined a plan to have Harvard faculty deliver instruction to a small group of Cambridge and Boston women. He approached Harvard President Charles William Eliot with the idea, and Eliot approved. Gilman and Eliot recruited a group of prominent and well-connected Cambridge women to manage the plan. These women were Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, Mary H. Cooke, Stella Scott Gilman, Mary B. Greenough, Ellen Hooper Gurney, Alice Mary Longfellow, and Lillian Horsford.

Building upon Gilman&#x27;s premise, the committee convinced 44 members of the Harvard faculty to consider giving lectures to female students in exchange for extra income paid by the committee. The program came to be known informally as &quot;The Harvard Annex.&quot; The course of study for the first year included 51 courses in 13 subject areas, an &quot;impressive curriculum with greater diversity than that of any other women&#x27;s college at its inception. Courses were offered in Greek, Latin, English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish; philosophy, political economy, history, music, mathematics, physics, and natural history.&quot; The first graduation ceremonies took place in the library of Longfellow House on Brattle Street, just above where George Washington&#x27;s generals had slept a century earlier.

The committee members hoped that by raising an endowment for The Annex, they could persuade Harvard to admit women directly into Harvard College, but the university resisted. In his 1869 inaugural address as president of Harvard, Charles Eliot summed up the official Harvard position toward female students when he said, 
&quot;The world knows next to nothing about the capacities of the female sex. Only after generations of civil freedom and social equality will it be possible to obtain the data necessary for an adequate discussion of woman&#x27;s natural tendencies, tastes, and capabilities...It is not the business of the University to decide this mooted point.&quot; 

====Harvard Examinations for Women====
From 1874 to 1881, Harvard administered the Harvard Examinations for Women to increase women&#x27;s educational opportunities, after being pressured by the Women&#x27;s Education Association of Boston. During these seven years, 107 women participated; 36 received certificates. The low number of certificates received by women led Harvard to change the exam in 1881. At the time, women could also be admitted into the &quot;Harvard Annex&quot;, the women&#x27;s version of a college education. The &quot;Harvard Examinations for Women&quot; included subjects such as history; literature of Shakespeare and Chaucer; languages such as Latin, French, and German; botany; and mathematics. These tests were similar to the admittance exam given to men applying to Harvard College. When a woman passed a subject, she would receive a signed certificate from Harvard&#x27;s president acknowledging her passing mark.

The Harvard Examinations for Women were ended two years after &quot;Harvard Annex&quot; officially became Radcliffe College, the women&#x27;s equivalent to Harvard College.

When confronted in 1883 with the notion of females receiving Harvard degrees, the university&#x27;s treasurer stated, &quot;I have no prejudice in the matter of education of women and am quite willing to see Yale or Columbia take any risks they like, but I feel bound to protect Harvard College from what seems to me a risky experiment.&quot;

In 1888, Harvard President Eliot in 1888 communicated to a faculty member he intended to hire that &quot;There is no obligation to teach at The Annex. Those professors who on general grounds take an interest in the education of women...feel some obligation but there are many professors who think it their duty NOT to teach there, in which opinion some of the Corporation and Overseers agree.&quot; 

Eliot was strongly against co-education, saying, &quot;The difficulties involved in a common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age are very grave. The necessary police regulations are exceedingly burdensome.&quot;

In December 1893, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported, &quot;President of Harvard To Sign Parchments of the Fair Graduates&quot;. Students seeking admission to the new women&#x27;s college were required to sit for the same entrance examinations required of Harvard College students.

The committee persevered despite Eliot&#x27;s skepticism. The project proved to be a success, attracting a growing number of students. As a result, the Annex was incorporated in 1882 as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, with Elizabeth Cary Agassiz, widow of Harvard professor Louis Agassiz, as president. This society awarded certificates to students but did not have the power to confer academic degrees. 

In subsequent years, ongoing discussions with Harvard about admitting women directly into the university still came to a dead end. Instead, Harvard and the Annex negotiated the creation of a degree-granting institution, with Harvard professors serving as its faculty and visiting body. This modification of the Annex was chartered by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Radcliffe College in 1894. 

By 1896, the Globe could headline a story: &quot;Sweet Girls. They Graduate in Shoals at Radcliffe. Commencement Exercises at Sanders Theatre. Galleries Filled with Fair Friends and Students. Handsome Mrs. Agassiz Made Fine Address. Pres Eliot Commends the Work of the New Institution.&quot; The Globe said, &quot;Eliot stated that the percentage of graduates with distinction is much higher at Radcliffe than at Harvard&quot; and that although &quot;[i]t is to yet to be seen whether the women have the originality and pioneering spirit which will fit them to be leaders, perhaps they will when they have had as many generations of thorough education as men.&quot;

===20th century===
In 1904, a historian Mary Caroline Crawford wrote the following about the genesis of Radcliffe College: 
&quot;...it set up housekeeping in two unpretending rooms in the Appian Way, Cambridge...Probably in all the history of colleges in America there could not be found a story so full of color and interest as that of the beginning of this woman&#x27;s college. The bathroom of the little house was pressed into service as a laboratory for physics, students and instructors alike making the best of all inconveniences. Because the institution was housed with a private family, generous mothering was given to the girls when they needed it.&quot;

In the first two decades of the 20th century, Radcliffe championed the beginnings of its own campus, consisting of the Radcliffe Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle in Cambridge, Massachusetts, not far from Harvard University. The original Radcliffe gymnasium and library, and the Bertram, Whitman, Eliot, and Barnard dormitories were constructed during this period. With the 1920s and 1930s, dormitories Briggs Hall (1924) and Cabot Hall (1937) were built on the Quadrangle, and in the Radcliffe Yard, the administrative building Byerly Hall (1932) and the classroom building Longfellow Hall (1930). Mary Almy was the architect.

English professor Barrett Wendell warned his colleagues about continued cooperation with Radcliffe, saying that Harvard could &quot;suddenly find itself committed to coeducation somewhat as unwary men lay themselves open to actions for breach of promise.&quot; In Wendell&#x27;s view, Harvard needed to remain &quot;purely virile.&quot; 

In 1923, Ada Comstock, a leader in the movement to provide women with higher education, who hailed from the University of Minnesota and Smith College, became the college&#x27;s third president. She was a key figure in the college&#x27;s early 20th-century development. Speaking of her, one alumna remembers that &quot;we were in awe of &#x27;Miss Comstock... and knew even then that we had been touched by a vanishing breed of female educator. Ada Comstock had an extraordinary presence—she radiated dignity, strength, and decisiveness.&quot; In the early 1940s, she negotiated a new relationship with Harvard that vastly expanded women&#x27;s access to the full Harvard course catalog.

====Growth====
David McCord set the college apart from the other Seven Sister institutions, saying &quot;there is one respect in which Radcliffe differs from her sisters, and this should be made clear. Although she divides with Barnard, Bryn Mawr, and Wellesley all advantages of a large city, and enjoys the further privilege of being front-fence neighbor to Harvard University, Radcliffe alone has had from the first the strength of a university faculty...Thus, from the beginning, Radcliffe has been a woman&#x27;s Harvard. It is still a separate institution, with its own corporation, receiving from Harvard no financial aid.&quot; Because it had a university – as opposed to &quot;collegiate&quot; – faculty, Radcliffe was unique among the Seven Sisters in being able to provide a graduate program with a wide number of opportunities for students to pursue advanced studies. 

M. Carey Thomas, the second president and chief visionary of Bryn Mawr College, lobbied against the conversion of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women into Radcliffe College precisely because the Cambridge rival&#x27;s access to a university faculty competed with Bryn Mawr&#x27;s own academic ambitions. Between 1890 and 1963, Radcliffe awarded more than 750 PhDs and more than 3000 masters degrees to women. During the 1950s, the school conferred more PhDs to women than any schools other than Columbia and the University of Chicago. In 1955–56, the college produced more female PhDs than any other institution in the United States.

Because Radcliffe&#x27;s faculty was Harvard&#x27;s, in the college&#x27;s first 50 years, professors from Harvard, each under individual contracts with the Radcliffe administration – duplicated lectures, providing them first for men in the Harvard Yard and then crossing the Cambridge Common to provide the same lectures to women in the Radcliffe Yard. Professor Elwood Byerly wrote that he &quot;always found the spirit, industry, and ability of the girls admirable—indeed, the average has been higher in my mathematics classes in the Annex than in my classes at the college. 

In March 1915, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 1915 that all of the prizes offered in a playwriting competition at Harvard and Radcliffe that year were won by Radcliffe students. One of the Harvard contributions received honorable mention.

In the early 1960s, the newspaper also reported that &quot;taking the same courses and exams as Harvard, 60 percent of Radcliffe&#x27;s girls [sic] were on the Dean&#x27;s List as compared with 42 percent of Harvard men [sic].&quot;

Dorothy Howells noted that, &quot;Allegations were made that Radcliffe was a &quot;vampire&quot; and a &quot;temptress&quot; enticing the teacher from his career-advancing research and publication with the lure of additional income.&quot; 

Ruth Hubbard, a member of the Harvard faculty from 1974 to 1990 and a member of the Radcliffe class of 1944, noted that &quot;the senior (Harvard) professors were less than thrilled to have to repeat their lectures at Radcliffe. The lower rank faculty members, who were sometimes detailed off to teach the introductory science courses at Radcliffe instead of teaching Harvard students, felt even more declasse.&quot; 

Marion Cannon Schlesinger, Radcliffe Class of 1934, noted that &quot;there were, to be sure, certain professors who looked with horror at the incursions of women into the sacred precincts of Harvard College, even at the safe distance of the Radcliffe Yard, and would have nothing to do with the academic arrangements by which their colleagues taught the Radcliffe girls. Professor Roger Merriman, for example, the first master of Eliot House and a professor of history, would not have been caught dead teaching a Radcliffe class.&quot;.

During World War II, declines in male enrollment at Harvard and heightened sensitivity about the use of resources called for a new, more efficient arrangement concerning faculty time. Under the leadership of President Comstock, Radcliffe and Harvard signed an agreement that for the first time allowed Radcliffe and Harvard students to attend the same classes in the Harvard Yard, officially beginning joint instruction in 1943. Equally significant, the agreement ended the era in which individual faculty members at Harvard could choose whether to enter contracts with Radcliffe. 

The agreement instead opened the entire Harvard catalogue to Radcliffe students, in exchange for which Radcliffe made a payment to Harvard of a fixed portion of Radcliffe tuitions. President Comstock noted that the agreement was &quot;the most significant event since our charter was granted in 1894.&quot; All Harvard faculty, whether interested or not, had a legal obligation to teach Radcliffe students. In practice a few holdouts on the Harvard faculty maneuvered around this obligation by announcing that their classes had &quot;limited enrollment&quot; and then limiting enrollment solely to male students. At the time, both Harvard and Radcliffe were adamant in telling the press that this arrangement was &quot;joint instruction&quot; but not &quot;coeducation.&quot; Reacting to the agreement, Harvard President James Bryant Conant said, &quot;Harvard was not coeducational in theory, only in practice.&quot; Indeed, Radcliffe continued to maintain a separate admissions office which, by general acknowledgment, was more stringent in its academic requirements of applicants than Harvard&#x27;s. Most extra-curricular activities at the two colleges remained separate.

Following World War II, Radcliffe negotiated a higher ceiling on its student enrollment. This success was orchestrated in tandem with additional housing construction. Moors Hall was completed in 1949, Holmes Hall in 1952, the Cronkhite Graduate Center in 1956, and Comstock Hall in 1958. The added dormitory space and national recruiting campaigns led to an increasingly national and international student body. 

In 1961, the Jordan Cooperative Houses, an option for students to engage in more communal living, with student responsibility for shopping for food, preparing meals and housekeeping, were built, and the college purchased Wolbach Hall, an apartment building also known as 124 Walker Street, in 1964. Radcliffe constructed Hilles Library in 1966 and the Radcliffe Quadrangle Athletic Center in 1982.

Also in 1961, then President Mary Bunting reorganized the autonomous Radcliffe dormitories into &quot;houses,&quot; mirroring Harvard&#x27;s houses and Yale University&#x27;s residential colleges. 

The three houses (North, South, and East) were eventually consolidated into two (North and South). In 1970, the college completed construction of Currier House, the first Radcliffe House designed with the &quot;House Plan&quot; in mind. South House eventually was renamed Cabot House in 1984 while North House became Pforzheimer House in 1995.

Bunting felt that the house system would give Radcliffe students an intellectual community comparable to what Harvard students were getting, bringing together faculty and students in a way the free-standing Radcliffe dormitories did not, and allowing all to see with greater clarity the aspirations, capabilities, and interests of undergraduate women. Speaking generally about her philosophy for Radcliffe, President Bunting noted that &quot;part of our special purpose is to convey to our students and through them to others that there is no basic conflict between being intellectual and being feminine.&quot;

Bunting also established the Radcliffe Institute in 1961. The institute – a precursor to the current Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study – gave financial support, access to research libraries and facilities, and recognition to scholarly women who had taken time away from intellectual pursuits to focus on home and family. In providing women with a venue to return to academe, Bunting was recognizing that traditional academic institutions were premised on a male life trajectory where a scholar&#x27;s domestic concerns were taken care of by someone else (usually a wife). 

The Radcliffe Institute, later renamed the Bunting Institute, was an institution premised on the needs of a female life trajectory, providing opportunities that might otherwise have been truncated by women&#x27;s decisions during early adulthood to leave academia to raise children.

In the 1930s, Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell took a dim view of Radcliffe, maintaining that the time Harvard professors spent providing lectures to women distracted the faculty from their scholarship, and providing Radcliffe women access to research facilities and Harvard museums was – in his view – an unnecessary burden on the university&#x27;s resources. He threatened to scuttle the relationship between the two institutions. Radcliffe was forced to agree to a limitation on the size of its student body, with 750 spaces for undergraduates and 250 for graduate students. 

A ceiling on enrollment of women when compared to the enrollment of men was renegotiated upward at various points throughout the relationship with Harvard and remained constant in Radcliffe&#x27;s operations until it began its ultimate incorporation into Harvard University in 1977.

== Presidents of Radcliffe College ==
The office of the president was created with the incorporation of the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in 1882. The society became Radcliffe College in 1894.

== Graduate and post-graduate opportunities ==

Radcliffe staff were invested in assisting women graduates with career planning and placement, as well as providing a number of different programs to provide post-graduate study for women. The Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration was begun as career training for alums interested in business. It grew to become a vehicle for women to pursue study at Harvard&#x27;s Business School.

Other post-graduate courses of study at Radcliffe grew as the undergraduate women students became more a part of Harvard University. The Radcliffe Publishing Course offered students experience in editing and other skills needed to enter the field of publishing. The Radcliffe Seminars Program in Landscape Design gave students a chance to study landscape design before it was a course of study at the Harvard Design School, and in a less formal environment.

Radcliffe first granted PhDs starting in 1902. Between 1894 and 1902, multiple students completed all course and thesis requirements for a PhD degree in the department of zoology, working in the Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory, without receiving the title.

== Student life and notable extracurricular activities ==

Beyond the life of the mind, another appeal of Radcliffe was the comparative freedom that its undergraduates enjoyed compared to students at other women&#x27;s colleges. Cambridge and Boston provided diversions that were denied to women at more geographically isolated institutions. In his history of the college, David McCord noted that &quot;the music, theaters and museums were surprisingly close.&quot; While students at many women&#x27;s colleges only had social interactions with men on weekends, Radcliffe students saw men in town and, after 1943, in classes and laboratories on a daily basis while still having their own institution, student organizations and activities, and space. In the 1950s, an era of &quot;in loco parentis&quot; at many postsecondary institutions, it was common at women&#x27;s colleges for housemothers to keep diligent watch of the time when women returned to their dorms, locking the doors when check-in hour had arrived and punishing women who missed their check-in times. Radcliffe students, by contrast, had their own dormitory keys and filled out sign-in sheets when they arrived in the evening. Their lives were not as cloistered as those of some of their counterparts at the sister schools, and according to an article in &quot;Mademoiselle Magazine&quot;, &quot;it was the richness and freedom of life at Radcliffe&quot; which left its mark on the student body. One graduate of the class of 1934 noted, &quot;We were getting the best education in the country, and besides, we weren&#x27;t banished to the sticks to rusticate. Weekends at Yale and Princeton may have been the answer to a maiden&#x27;s prayer at Vassar, but we did not have to wait for ceremonial weekends for our entertainment: there were those among the Harvard population who recognized our &quot;merits.&quot; A student from the early 1960s picked up on this theme, contrasting the Radcliffe experience with that of Smith. &quot;There are smart girls at Smith, all right,&quot; she said. &quot;But they don&#x27;t seem to get much out of them there. Four years later they don&#x27;t seem to be any brighter. And they have this crazy week-end system. You spend all week in Bermuda shorts, with your hair in curlers, worrying over who&#x27;s going to take you to Amherst or New Haven Friday night. It seems to me that sort of thing actually retards you in the long run.&quot; (Conversely, the greater seclusion of places such as Smith, Vassar and Mt. Holyoke sometimes made these latter institutions more attractive to socially conservative families.)

Reflecting on her time at Radcliffe, writer Alison Lurie stated that &quot;most of the time we were in a mild state of euphoria...our lives were luxurious by modern undergraduate standards...We had private rooms, cleaned and tidied by tolerant Irish maids; a laundry called for our dirty clothes every week and returned them carefully washed and ironed; we ate off of china in our own dining room and sat in drawing rooms that resembled those of a good women&#x27;s club.&quot;

&quot;Pluck&quot; was a quality attributed to some Radcliffe students. Beth Gutcheon of the class of 1967 wrote in a reminiscence that &quot;One night a classmate of mine was leaving the library alone at eleven when somebody jumped her from behind and knocked her to the ground. She yelled, &#x27;Oh, Christ, I don&#x27;t have time for this. I have an exam tomorrow!&#x27; and after a disappointed pause, her attacker got up and went away.&quot;

Throughout most of the college&#x27;s history, residential life and student activities at Radcliffe remained separate from those at Harvard, with separate dormitories and dining facilities (located on the Radcliffe Quadrangle), newspapers (&quot;The Radcliffe News&quot;, &quot;Percussion&quot;), radio stations (WRRB and WRAD, a.k.a. Radio Radcliffe), drama society (The Idler), student government (Radcliffe Student Government Association and later, The Radcliffe Union of Students), yearbooks, athletic programs, choral associations (The Radcliffe Choral Society, the Cliffe Clefs, and later the Radcliffe Pitches), etc. (located in the Radcliffe Yard). Radcliffe had greater diversity in housing options than Harvard, with college-owned frame houses, an apartment building, and co-operative housing for students who were not interested in immersion in dormitory life or life within the House System.

Dances were popular features of undergraduate life. &quot;At different times there were class dances, club dances, junior and senior proms, sophomore tea dances, Christmas dances, and spring formals. Dormitory-based dances were known as &#x27;jolly-ups.&#x27;&quot; One particularly popular event during the 1950s was the Radcliffe Grant in Aid show, which was sponsored by the student government. The show raised money for scholarships and always ended with a student kick-line in red shorts. Perhaps because of the shorts, Harvard students were particularly drawn to the event.

The Radcliffe Choral Society was a popular and influential student group. Started in 1899 and conducted by Marie Gillison, a German-born singing teacher, the group cultivated an interest in sophisticated classical music at a time when many collegiate choral groups were devoted to college songs and more popular ditties. Archibald Davidson, who took up the reins of conducting the Choral Society after Gillison (he also conducted the Harvard Glee Club), stated, &quot;I sometimes wonder how much, if anything, Harvard realizes that it owes to Radcliffe... Harvard...should not forget that while its Glee Club was slowly progressing toward enlightenment, Radcliffe, just across the Common, had for a long time under Mrs. Gillison&#x27;s direction set an example of devotion to the best music.&quot; Davidson added that &quot;without the early and enthusiastic cooperation of &#x27;the young ladies of Radcliffe&#x27; the impressive tradition of college choral singing, which is now nationwide and which is always associated first with Cambridge, would almost certainly have been established much later here or would have originated elsewhere.&quot; Arranged by Mrs. Gillison, the 1917 Choral Society concert with the Harvard Glee Club and the Boston Symphony Orchestra was a footnote in music history, the first time a university chorus sang with a major orchestra. The concert became an annual tradition for many years.

The Radcliffe Crew is the oldest women&#x27;s rowing program in the Ivy League. Even after the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe, the team maintains the Radcliffe name and Radcliffe colors as a sign of respect for the tradition of Radcliffe and the women who fought to establish the rowing program. The crew has a distinguished history. The team won the national championship in 1973 and thus got to represent the United States at the Eastern European Championships in Moscow. In 1974, the Eastern Association of Women&#x27;s Rowing Colleges (EAWRC) was formed. In both 1974 and 1975, Radcliffe won consecutive Eastern Sprints titles. In 1987, Radcliffe&#x27;s heavyweight varsity eight completed an undefeated season with a victory at Eastern Sprints and an Ivy championship title. Six of the crew&#x27;s eight rowers went on to compete in the Olympic Games. In 1989, Radcliffe was also undefeated with a Sprints championship and Ivy title. The season finale was a victory in the Open Eight at the Henley Women&#x27;s Regatta in England.

== Growing consolidation with Harvard ==

The parallel Radcliffe and Harvard student universes—with formal intersections only in the classroom—continued until the 1960s. At this point, awareness of the comparative benefits of Radcliffe vis-a-vis the other Seven Sisters was increasingly eclipsed by growing sensitivity to the disadvantages that Radcliffe students had vis-a-vis Harvard students. Harvard students lived closer to the Harvard Yard, while Radcliffe students had a longer walk to Yard-based classes from the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Harvard housing was more luxurious than Radcliffe dormitories, and much more of the schools&#x27; shared intellectual life took place on the Harvard campus. Financial aid and student prizes at Harvard were larger than those at Radcliffe, even though students from the two schools were enrolled in the same courses. By the late 1950s, the terms of the &quot;joint instruction&quot; agreement still imposed a ceiling on the enrollment of Radcliffe students, with Harvard males getting four times the number of spots in a freshman class that Radcliffe students got. And at the end of four years of study, students at Harvard received a diploma from Harvard while Radcliffe students taking the same courses received a diploma from Radcliffe.

These asymmetries did not bother all students, as some viewed the differences as a matter of course between two different institutions. This perspective was particularly strong with Radcliffe students who graduated before the turbulent 1960s. One alumna from the 1940s mused that at Radcliffe &quot;we were supremely happy in our own environment. For us, Harvard remained &#x27;the other.&#x27; Most of us felt no connection to it;...instead, we enjoyed our own collegiate activities and traditions. Another graduate from the class of 1949 noted that she was &quot;having my cake and eating it, too. In addition to my Harvard education, I was enjoying the benefits of a small women&#x27;s college. The Radcliffe Quadrangle was quiet and peaceful, life in the dormitories was friendly and gracious. ... The women who had chosen to come to Radcliffe all were intelligent, quite independent, and concerned with the world around them.&quot; Additionally, Radcliffe offered a cultural advantage over Harvard: even when enrolled in the same courses, Harvard and Radcliffe student took exams separately, as Radcliffe College&#x27;s honor code necessitated a vastly different exam-taking environment: &quot;Where the men&#x27;s exam rituals included proctors, dress codes, and a strict requirement of silence, the Radcliffe women took un-proctored exams, relished the chance to wear informal pants instead of skirts, and could enter and exit the building as they wished so long as they did not cheat.&quot; Similarly, the Radcliffe honor code provided for more generous library and campus space privileges (for student groups) than the more bureaucratic Harvard systems allowed.

However, some people within the Radcliffe community were less sanguine about the differences between the two schools, seeing the relationship with Harvard as an institutionalized separate but unequal experience for women. Writer Alison Lurie reflected that &quot;for Radcliffe students of my time the salient fact about Harvard was that it so evidently was not ours. Our position was like that of poor relations living just outside the walls of a great estate: patronized by some of our grand relatives, tolerated by others, and snubbed or avoided by the rest.&quot;

Famed poet Adrienne Rich, class of 1951, described receiving an &quot;insidious double message&quot; when she was at Radcliffe. Radcliffe students &quot;were told that we were the most privileged college women in America,&quot; but &quot;while intellectual and emotional life went on with intensity in all-female dorms, and we had our own newspaper, our own literary magazine, clubs, and student government, we knew that the real power (and money) were invested in Harvard&#x27;s institutions, from which we were excluded.&quot;

Acceptance of the 19th-century rationales for this exclusion was fading, particularly as during the 1960s, a nationwide movement for co-education grew. Reflecting this movement, many Radcliffe students began to insist upon receiving Harvard diplomas for their academic work and upon merging Radcliffe and Harvard extra-curricular activities. Growing budgetary problems at Radcliffe encouraged this insistence. The Radcliffe Graduate School merged with Harvard&#x27;s in 1963, and from that year onward Radcliffe undergraduates received Harvard University diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard. (Harvard students&#x27; diplomas were signed only by the president of Harvard.) Radcliffe students were fully and permanently admitted to Harvard&#x27;s Lamont Library in 1967.
Many Radcliffe and Harvard student groups combined during the 1960s and joint commencement exercises between the two institutions began in 1970. In 1971, largely in response to gains made by newly co-ed Princeton and Yale in their respective yields of students admitted to Harvard, Yale and Princeton, and to comparable admissions competition posed by the increasing national popularity of co-ed Stanford, Harvard president Derek Bok reduced the admissions ratio of Harvard students to Radcliffe students from 4:1 to 5:2. That same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students through an experimental program, and in 1972 full co-residence between the two colleges was instituted. The schools&#x27; departments of athletics merged shortly thereafter.

By the late 1960s there were open discussions between Radcliffe and Harvard about complete merger of the two institutions—which in truth meant abolition of Radcliffe. However, a merger study committee of the Radcliffe Alumnae Association recommended caution. In a prepared statement, the committee reported that &quot;it would be a mistake to dissolve Radcliffe at this time. Women&#x27;s self-awareness is increasing as the &#x27;women&#x27;s liberation movement develops and as moderate groups call attention to the life styles and problems particular to women. This is precisely the wrong time to abolish a prestigious women&#x27;s college which should be giving leadership to women as they seek to define and enlarge their role in society.&quot;

Instead of a complete merger, in 1977 Radcliffe president Matina Horner and Harvard president Derek Bok signed an agreement that, through their admission to Radcliffe, put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. The so-called &quot;non-merger merger&quot; combined the Radcliffe and Harvard admissions offices and ended the forced ceiling on female enrollment. In practice most of the energies of Radcliffe (which remained an autonomous institution) were then devoted to the institution&#x27;s research initiatives and fellowships, rather than to female undergraduates. The Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduate communities and classes came to be known officially as &quot;Harvard and Radcliffe&quot; or &quot;Harvard-Radcliffe&quot;, and female students continued to be awarded degrees signed by both presidents. Radcliffe continued to own its campus and provided financial aid, undergraduate prizes, and externship and fellowship opportunities to Radcliffe students, and the college continued to sponsor academic access programs for high school girls and continuing education opportunities for people outside the traditional college age. The college also continued to support programs and workshops targeting female undergraduates.

In practice, though, Radcliffe at this point had minimal impact on the average undergraduate&#x27;s day to day experiences at the university. This minimal role fueled still more talk about a full merger of the two schools. Conversely, supporters of the &quot;non-merger merger&quot; maintained that the agreement gave Radcliffe students the full benefits of Harvard citizenship while allowing maintenance of the proud Radcliffe identity, an institution with its own mission, programs, financial resources and alumnae network. 

On October 1, 1999, Radcliffe College was fully absorbed into Harvard University; female undergraduates were henceforward members only of Harvard College while Radcliffe College evolved into the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.

==Radcliffe after the merger==

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, now a division of Harvard University, carries on many of the research and professional development programs that Radcliffe College pioneered and has introduced other programs to the worldwide community of scholars. The end of Radcliffe&#x27;s role as an undergraduate institution, however, still has its detractors. &quot;Although I realize the merger was inevitable,&quot; a member of the class of 1959 commented, &quot;...I nevertheless regret the loss of my college, which gave me so much. Another noted that she &quot;feels sad that Radcliffe College no longer exists. It, far more than Harvard, defined my college experience. I can&#x27;t remember a single Harvard classmate, but two of my best friends are fellow Cliffies and I exchange correspondence with about a dozen more.&quot; Indeed, many Radcliffe alumnae feel their institution has relinquished its distinguished identity in favor of a male-oriented one that remains steadfastly dismissive of women&#x27;s concerns. This latter perspective gained some traction when, in a voice reminiscent of Presidents Eliot and Lowell, Harvard&#x27;s early 21st-century president Lawrence Summers publicly stated that women were not as capable in the sciences as men. Additionally, shortly after full merger of the two schools, Harvard undergraduate women feeling a void in Harvard&#x27;s support for women&#x27;s intellectual and personal development started to lobby Harvard to create a women&#x27;s center. Perhaps not surprisingly, memories of Harvard&#x27;s historical indifference to women have led many Radcliffe alumnae to maintain primary ties to Radcliffe College and not to Harvard University. &quot;Womenless history has been a Harvard specialty,&quot; Laurel Thatcher Ulrich noted. The Annex gained some vindication against Presidents Eliot, Lowell, and Summers when Drew Gilpin Faust, Dean of the Radcliffe Institute, replaced Summers and became Harvard&#x27;s first female president.

Radcliffe College alumnae continue to press Harvard on the question of the university&#x27;s commitment to women, and increasing the number of female faculty members at Harvard is a particular alumnae interest. Former Radcliffe president Matina Horner once told the New York Times of her surprise when she first delivered a lecture at Harvard in 1969 and four male students approached her. One of these students told her that they &quot;just wanted to see what it felt like to be lectured by a woman and if a woman could be articulate.&quot; Picking up on the perceived common Harvard blind-eye to women&#x27;s intellectual competence and reflecting on the fact that while at Radcliffe they had had very few female faculty members, in the late 1990s a group of Radcliffe alumnae established the Committee for The Equality of Women at Harvard. The group chose to boycott Harvard&#x27;s fundraising campaigns and sent letters to all 27,000 Radcliffe alumnae and to 13,000 Harvard alumni asking them to shift their donations to an escrow account until the university stepped up its efforts to add women to its tenured faculty. The group has not established quotas that it wants Harvard to meet. Rather, it has stated that individual Harvard departments should measure their percentage of tenured women faculty against a &quot;realistically available pool&quot; and create a plan to increase the number of women if that percentage falls short. The group also said that when departments do so, the escrow account (now called the Harvard Women&#x27;s Faculty Fund) will be turned over to Harvard.

In the meantime, enriched by hundreds of millions of dollars that Harvard conferred unto Radcliffe at the time of the full merger, the Radcliffe Institute today awards dozens of annual fellowships to prominent academics. Although it does not focus solely on women returning to academe, it is a major research center within Harvard University. Its Schlesinger Library is one of America&#x27;s largest repositories of manuscripts and archives relating to the history of women.

Several undergraduate student organizations in Harvard College still refer to Radcliffe in their names, (for example the Radcliffe Union of Students, Harvard&#x27;s feminist organization; the Radcliffe Choral Society, Harvard&#x27;s female choir (now one of the Holden Choirs), which has alumnae from both Radcliffe and Harvard and maintains a repertoire of Radcliffiana; the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra; the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players; the Radcliffe Pitches, a female a cappella singing group; and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club). Two athletic teams still compete under the Radcliffe name: varsity crew, which still rows with Radcliffe&#x27;s black-and-white oarblades and uniforms instead of Harvard&#x27;s crimson-and-white (in 1973 the team had been the only varsity team which voted not to adopt the Harvard name); and club rugby union. In addition, the Harvard University Band still plays a Radcliffe fight song.

<text>Lieutenant General John Randolph Vines (born June 2, 1949 in Alabama) is the former commander of the U.S. Army&#x27;s XVIII Airborne Corps and Multi-National Corps – Iraq.

Vines previously commanded the 82nd Airborne Division during the U.S. deployment to Afghanistan. He was responsible for tactical combat missions. Subsequently, Vines replaced Lt. Gen. Dan K. McNeill as the commanding general of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.

==Career==
Vines received his BS Degree in Chemistry from the University of Alabama and his MA Degree in National Security and Strategy from the Naval War College.

He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of Infantry in 1971 through the ROTC program at the University of Alabama.

His previous assignments include the 3rd Infantry Division; U.S. Army Europe and Seventh U.S. Army; Ranger Department, US Army Infantry Center; Company Commander and S3 in the 1st Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment; and the original Executive Officer of the 3rd Ranger Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment at its activation from 1984 until 1987.

As Lieutenant General, Vines has served in several command and staff assignments within the XVIII Airborne Corps to include joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command. He served as Commander, 4th Battalion, 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment, during its combat parachute assault in Operation Just Cause and later when the unit was deployed as the first ground combat unit in Operation Desert Shield.

His second tour of joint duty with the Joint Special Operations Command included operations in Somalia; Commander, 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault); Assistant Division Commander for Operations, 82d Airborne Division; Chief of Staff, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg; Chief of Office of Military Cooperation, Cairo, Egypt; Commander, 82d Airborne Division from August 2000 until October 2002; Commander, Coalition Task Force 82, in Afghanistan from 1 September 2002 until 1 May 2003; and then Commander, Combined Joint Task Force 180, Bagram, Afghanistan, until October 2003; Commander, Multi-National Corps – Iraq in Baghdad from January 2005 until January 2006.

After retirement, Vines spent a few months on the board of USFalcon, an information technology and systems engineering firm specializing in defense. He had consulted for the Department of Defense, but does not now have any industry ties. &quot;One of the reasons I chose not to do that is that I felt like I would be taking advantage of a revolving door,&quot; he said. &quot;There is a lot of hypocrisy there.&quot;

<doc id="242984" wikidata="Q427183" url="?curid=242984" title="Music of Puerto Rico">
<text>The Music of [[Puerto Rico]] has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources of Puerto Rico have primarily included African, Taino Indigenous, and European influences. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from essentially native genres such as bomba, jíbaro, seis, danza, and plena to more recent hybrid genres such as salsa, Latin trap and reggaeton. Broadly conceived, the realm of &quot;Puerto Rican music&quot; should naturally comprise the music culture of the millions of people of Puerto Rican descent who have lived in the United States, especially in New York City. Their music, from salsa to the boleros of Rafael Hernández, cannot be separated from the music culture of Puerto Rico itself.

==Traditional, folk, and popular music==
===Early music===
The music culture in Puerto Rico during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries is poorly documented. Certainly, it included Spanish troubadour, church music, military band music, and diverse genres of dance music cultivated by the jíbaros and enslaved Africans and their descendants. While these later never constituted more than 11% of the island&#x27;s population, they contributed to some of the island&#x27;s most dynamic musical features becoming unforgettable and distinct indeed.

In the 19th century Puerto Rican music begins to emerge into historical daylight, with notated genres like danza being naturally better documented than folk genres like jíbaro music and bomba y plena and seis. However, in the early 20th century “musica Jíbara” gained recording momentum, and poet or troubadour-jíbaro artists were recording music in Puerto Rico as well as New York. Names such as Florencio Morales Ramos (&quot;Ramito&quot;) (1915 – 1989), Johnny Albino (1919 – 2011), Odilio Gonzalez (&quot;El Jibarito de Lares&quot;) (born 1937), Alfonso Vélez (&quot;Jíbaro de Añasco&quot;) (born 1939), and Nito Mendez (1941 – 2011), saw lots of studio time, influencing new sounds in the Caribbean.

The African people of the island used drums made of carved hardwood covered with untreated rawhide on one side, commonly made from goatskin. A popular word derived from creole to describe this drum was &quot;shukbwa&quot;, which translates to &#x27;trunk of tree&#x27;. After the arrival of African slaves, Bomba became the music of the people.

(Unfinished)

===Folk music===
If the term &quot;folk music&quot; is taken to mean music genres that have flourished without elite support, and have evolved independently of the commercial mass media, the realm of Puerto Rican folk music would comprise the primarily Hispanic-derived jíbaro music, the Afro-Puerto Rican bomba, and the essentially &quot;creole&quot; plena. As these three genres evolved in Puerto Rico and are unique to that island, they occupy a respected place in island culture, even if they are not currently as popular as contemporary music such as salsa or reggaeton.

====Jíbaro music====
Jíbaros are small farmers of mixed descent who constituted the overwhelming majority of the Puerto Rican population until the mid-twentieth century. They are traditionally recognized as romantic icons of land cultivation, hard-working, self-sufficient, hospitable, and with an innate love of song and dance. Their instruments were relatives of the Spanish vihuela, especially the cuatro — which evolved from four single strings to five pairs of double strings — and the lesser known tiple. A typical jíbaro group nowadays might feature a cuatro, guitar, and percussion instrument such as the güiro scraper and/or bongo. Lyrics to jíbaro music are generally in the décima form, consisting of ten octosyllabic lines in the rhyme scheme ABBA ACCDDC. Décima form derives from 16th century Spain. Although it has largely died out in that country (except the Canaries), it took root in various places in Latin America—especially Cuba and Puerto Rico—where it is sung in diverse styles. A sung décima might be pre-composed, derived from a publication by some literati, or ideally, improvised on the spot, especially in the form of a “controversia” in which two singer-poets trade witty insults or argue on some topic. In between the décimas, lively improvisations can be played on the cuatro. This music form is also known as &quot;típica&quot; as well as &quot;trópica&quot;.

The décimas are sung to stock melodies, with standardized cuatro accompaniment patterns. About twenty such song types are in common use. These are grouped into two broad categories, viz., seis (e.g., seis fajardeño, seis chorreao) and aguinaldo (e.g., aguinaldo orocoveño, aguinaldo cayeyano). Traditionally, the seis could accompany dancing, but this tradition has largely died out except in tourist shows and festivals. The aguinaldo is most characteristically sung during the Christmas season, when groups of revelers (parrandas) go from house to house, singing jíbaro songs and partying. The aguinaldo texts are generally not about Christmas, and also unlike Anglo-American Christmas carols, they are generally sung by a solo with the other revelers singing the chorus. In general, the Christmas season is a time when traditional music—both seis and aguinaldo—is most likely to be heard. Fortunately, many groups of Puerto Ricans are dedicated to preserving traditional music through continued practice.
Jíbaro music came to be marketed on commercial recordings in the twentieth century, and singer-poets like Ramito (Flor Morales Ramos, 1915–90) are well documented. However, jíbaros themselves were becoming an endangered species, as agribusiness and urbanization have drastically reduced the numbers of small farmers on the island. Many jíbaro songs dealt accordingly with the vicissitudes of migration to New York. Jíbaro music has in general declined accordingly, although it retains its place in local culture, especially around Christmas time and special social gatherings, and there are many cuatro players, some of whom have cultivated prodigious virtuosity.

====Bomba====

Historical references indicate that by the decades around 1800 plantation slaves were cultivating a music and dance genre called bomba. By the mid-twentieth century, when it started to be recorded and filmed, bomba was performed in regional variants in various parts of the island, especially Loíza, Ponce, San Juan, and Mayagüez. It is not possible to reconstruct the history of bomba; various aspects reflect Congolese derivation, though some elements (as suggested by subgenre names like &quot;holandés&quot;) have come from elsewhere in the Caribbean. French Caribbean elements are particularly evident in the bomba style of Mayagüez, and striking choreographic parallels can be seen with the bélé of Martinique. All of these sources were blended into a unique sound that reflects the life of the Jibaro, the slaves, and the culture of Puerto Rico.

In its call-and-response singing set to ostinato-based rhythms played on two or three squat drums (&quot;barriles&quot;), bomba resembles other neo-African genres in the Caribbean. Of clear African provenance is its format in which a single person emerges from an informal circle of singers to dance in front of the drummers, engaging the lead drummer in a sort of playful duel; after dancing for a while, that person is then replaced by another. While various such elements can be traced to origins in Africa or elsewhere, bomba must be regarded as a local Afro-Puerto Rican creation. Its rhythms (e.g. &quot;seis corrido, yubá, leró&quot;, etc.), dance moves, and song lyrics that sometimes mimic farm animals (in Spanish, with some French creole words in eastern Puerto Rico) collectively constitute a unique Puerto Rican genre.

In the 1950s, the dance-band ensemble of Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera performed several songs in they had labeled as &quot;bombas&quot;; although these bore some similarities to the &quot;sicá&quot; style of bomba, in their rhythms and horn arrangements they also borrowed noticeably from the Cuban dance music which had long been popular in the island. Giving rise to Charanga music. As of the 1980s, bomba had declined, although it was taught, in a somewhat formalized fashion, by the Cepeda family in Santurce, San Juan, and was still actively performed informally, though with much vigor, in the Loíza towns, home to the then Ayala family dynasty of bomberos. Bomba continues to survive there and has also experienced something of a revival, being cultivated by folkloric groups such as Son Del Batey, Los Rebuleadores de San Juan, Bomba Evolución, Abrane y La Tribu, and many more elsewhere on the island. In New York City with groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, members of La Casita de Chema, and Alma Moyo. In Chicago Buya, and Afro-Caribe have kept the tradition alive and evolving. In California Bomba Liberte, Grupo Aguacero, Bombalele, La Mixta Criolla, Herencia de los Carrillo, and Los Bomberas de la Bahia are all groups that have promoted and preserved the culture. Women have also played a role in its revival, as in the case of the all-female group Yaya, Legacy Woman, Los Bomberas de la Bahia, Grupo Bambula (Originally female group), and Ausuba in Puerto Rico.

There has also been a strong commitment towards Bomba Fusion. Groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21, and Viento De Agua have contributed greatly towards fusing Bomba and Plena with Jazz and other Genres. Yerbabuena has brought a popular cross-over appeal. Abrante y La Tribu have made fusions with Hip Hop. Tambores Calientes, Machete Movement, and Ceiba have fused the genres with various forms of Rock and Roll.

The Afro-Puerto Rican &quot;bombas&quot;, developed in the sugarcane haciendas of Loíza, the northeastern coastal areas, in Guayama and southern Puerto Rico, utilize barrel drums and tambourines, while the rural version uses stringed instruments to produce music, relating to the bongos. (1) “The bomba is danced in pairs, but there is no contact. The dancers each challenge the drums and musicians with their movements by approaching them and performing a series of fast steps called floretea piquetes, creating a rhythmic discourse. Unlike normal dance routines, the drummers are the ones who follow the performers and create a beat or rhythm based on their movements. Women who dance bomba often use dresses or scarves to enhance bodily movements. Unlike normal dance terms, the instruments follow the performer.

Like other such traditions, bomba is now well documented on sites like YouTube, and a few ethnographic documentary films.

====Plena====

Around 1900 plena emerged as a humble proletarian folk genre in the lower-class, largely Afro-Puerto Rican urban neighborhoods in San Juan, Ponce, and elsewhere. Plena subsequently came to occupy its niche in island music culture. In its quintessential form, plena is an informal, unpretentious, simple folk-song genre, in which alternating verses and refrains are sung to the accompaniment of round, often homemade frame drums called &quot;panderetas&quot; (like tambourines without jingles), perhaps supplemented by accordion, guitar, or whatever other instruments might be handy. An advantage of the percussion arrangement is its portability, contributing to the plena&#x27;s spontaneous appearance at social gatherings. Other instruments commonly heard in plena music are the cuatro, the maracas, and accordions.

The plena rhythm is a simple duple pattern, although a lead pandereta player might add lively syncopations. Plena melodies tend to have an unpretentious, &quot;folksy&quot; simplicity. Some early plena verses commented on barrio anecdotes, such as &quot;Cortarón Elena&quot; (They stabbed Elena) or &quot;Allí vienen las maquinas&quot; (Here come the firetrucks). Many had a decidedly irreverent and satirical flavor, such as &quot;Llegó el obispo&quot; mocking a visiting bishop. Some plenas, such as &quot;Cuando las mujeres quieren a los hombres&quot; and &quot;Santa María,&quot; are familiar throughout the island. In 1935 the essayist Tomás Blanco celebrated plena—rather than the outdated and elitist danza—as an expression of the island&#x27;s fundamentally creole, Taino or mulatto racial and cultural character. Plenas are still commonly performed in various contexts; a group of friends attending a parade or festival may bring a few panderetas and burst into song, or new words will be fitted to the familiar tunes by protesting students or striking workers which have long been a regular form of protest from occupation and slavery. While enthusiasts might on occasion dance to a plena, plena is not characteristically oriented toward dance.
In the 1920s–30s plenas came to be commercially recorded, especially by Manuel &quot;El Canario&quot; Jimenez, who performed old and new songs, supplementing the traditional instruments with piano and horn arrangements. In the 1940s Cesar Concepción popularized a big-band version of plena, lending the genre a new prestige, to some extent at the expense of its proletarian vigor and sauciness. In the 1950s a newly invigorated plena emerged as performed by the smaller band of Rafael Cortijo and vocalist Ismael &quot;Maelo&quot; Rivera, attaining unprecedented popularity and modernizing the plena while recapturing its earthy vitality. Many of Cortijo&#x27;s plenas present colorful and evocative vignettes of barrio life and lent a new sort of recognition to the dynamic contribution of Afro-Puerto Ricans to the island&#x27;s culture (and especially music). This period represented the apogee of plena&#x27;s popularity as a commercial popular music. Unfortunately, Rivera spent much of the 1960s in prison, and the group never regained its former vigor. Nevertheless, the extraordinarily massive turnout for Cortijo&#x27;s funeral in 1981 reflected the beloved singer&#x27;s enduring popularity. By then, however, plena&#x27;s popularity had been replaced by that of salsa, although some revivalist groups, such as Plena Libre, continue to perform in their lively fashion, while &quot;street&quot; plena is also heard on various occasions.

===Danza===


By the late 1700s, the country dance (French contredanse, Spanish contradanza) had come to thrive as a popular recreational dance, both in courtly and festive vernacular forms, throughout much of Europe, replacing dances such as the minuet. By 1800 a creolized form of the genre, called contradanza, was thriving in Cuba, and the genre also appears to have been extant, in similar vernacular forms, in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and elsewhere, although documentation is scanty. By the 1850s, the Cuban contradanza—increasingly referred to as danza—was flourishing both as a salon piano piece, or as a dance-band item to accompany social dancing, in a style evolving from collective figure dancing (like a square dance) to independent couples dancing ballroom-style (like a waltz, but in duple rather than ternary rhythm). According to local chroniclers, in 1845 a ship arrived from Havana, bearing, among other things, a party of youths who popularized a new style of contradanza/danza, confusingly called &quot;merengue.&quot; This style subsequently became wildly popular in Puerto Rico, to the extent that in 1848 it was banned by the priggish Spanish governor Juan de la Pezuela y Cevallos. This prohibition, however, does not seem to have had much lasting effect, and the newly invigorated genre—now more commonly referred to as &quot;danza&quot;—went on to flourish in distinctly local forms. As in Cuba, these forms included the pieces of music played by dance ensembles as well as sophisticated light-classical items for solo piano (some of which could subsequently be interpreted by dance bands). The danza as a solo piano idiom reached its greatest heights in the music of Manuel Gregorio Tavárez (1843–83), whose compositions have a grace and grandeur closely resembling the music of Chopin, his model. Achieving greater popularity were the numerous danzas of his follower, Juan Morel Campos (1857–96), a bandleader and extraordinarily prolific composer who, like Tavárez, died in his youthful prime (but not before having composed over 300 danzas). By Morel Campos&#x27; time, the Puerto Rican Danza had evolved into a form quite distinct from that of its Cuban (not to mention European) counterparts. Particularly distinctive was its form consisting of an initial &quot;paseo&quot;, followed by two or three sections (sometimes called &quot;merengues&quot;), which might feature an arpeggio-laden &quot;obbligato&quot; melody played on the tuba-like &quot;bombardino&quot; (euphonium). Many danzas achieved island-wide popularity, including the piece &quot;La Borinqueña&quot;, which is the national anthem of Puerto Rico. Like other Caribbean creole genres such as the Cuban danzón, the danzas featured the insistent ostinato called &quot;cinquillo&quot; (roughly, ONE-two-THREE-FOUR-five-SIX-SEVEN-eight, repeated).

The danza remained vital until the 1920s, but after that decade its appeal came to be limited to the Hispanophilic elite. The danzas of Morel Campos, Tavárez, José Quintón, and a few others are still performed and heard on various occasions, and a few more recent composers have penned their idiosyncratic forms of danzas, but the genre is no longer a popular social dance idiom. During the first part of the dancing danza, to the steady tempo of the music, the couples promenade around the room; during the second, with a lively rhythm, they dance in a closed ballroom position and the orchestra would begin by leading dancers in a &quot;paseo,&quot; an elegant walk around the ballroom, allowing gentlemen to show off their lady&#x27;s grace and beauty. This romantic introduction ended with a salute by the gentlemen and a curtsey from the ladies in reply. Then, the orchestra would strike up and the couples would dance freely around the ballroom to the rhythm of the music.

===Puerto Rican Pop and New Wave===
Much music in Puerto Rico falls outside the standard categories of &quot;Latin music&quot; and is better regarded as constituting varieties of &quot;Latin world pop.&quot; This category includes, for example, Ricky Martin (who had a #1 Hot 100 hit in the U.S. with &quot;Livin&#x27; La Vida Loca&quot; in 1999), the boy-band Menudo (with its changing personnel of which Martin was once a member of), Los Chicos, Las Cheris, Salsa Kids and Chayanne. Famous singers include the Despacito singer Luis Fonsi. Also, singer and virtuoso guitarist Jose Feliciano born in Lares, Puerto Rico, became a world pop star in 1968 when his Latin-soul version of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and the LP &quot;Feliciano!&quot; became great successes in the American and international rankings and allowed Feliciano to be the first Puerto Rican to win Grammy awards, during that year. Feliciano&#x27;s &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot; remains one of the most popular Christmas songs.

===Reggaetón and Dembow===

The roots of reggaetón lie in the 1980s by Puerto Rican rapper Vico C. In the early 1990s reggaeton coalesced as a more definitive genre, using the &quot;Dem Bow&quot; riddim derived from a Shabba Ranks song by that name, and further resembling Jamaican dancehall in its verses sung in simple tunes and stentorian style, and its emphasis—via lyrics, videos, and artist personas—on partying, dancing, boasting, &quot;bling,&quot; and sexuality rather than weighty social commentary. While reggaeton may have commenced as a Spanish-language version of Jamaican dancehall, in the hands of performers like Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar, and others, it soon acquired its distinctive flavor and today might be considered the most popular dance music in the Spanish Caribbean, surpassing even salsa.

Reggaetón is a genre of music, significantly blown up in Puerto Rico and across the world, that combines Latin rhythms, dancehall, and hip-hop and rap music. Reggaetón is frequently affiliated with “machismo” characteristics, strong or aggressive masculine pride. Since women have joined this genre of music they have been underrepresented and have been fighting to change its image. This inevitably is causing controversy between what the genre was and what it is now. Reggaetón has transformed from being a musical expression with Jamaican and Panamanian roots to being “dembow” a newer style that has changed the game, which is listened to mainly in the Dominican Republic. Despite its success, its constant reputation highlights sexuality in the dancing, its explicit lyrics that have women screaming sexualized phrases in the background, and the clothing women are presented in. In the &#x27;90s and early 2000s, Reggaetón had been targeted and censored in many Latin American countries for its vulgar and course nature. Censorship can be seen as the government&#x27;s way of suppressing the people and ensuring that communication is not strong amongst the community. Since then, many women have joined Reggaetón in hopes of changing preconceptions. Many of them have paved the way and have successful careers such as the female trailblazer herself Ivy Queen, as well as Karol G, Becky G, and Rosalia among others. With strong influences from Puerto Rico and Jamaica, dembow originates from the Dominican Republic. When Shabba Ranks released the track &quot;Dem Bow&quot; in 1990, the name stuck and it did not take long for the dembow genre to form. The main elements of dembow music are its repetitive rhythm, which is somewhat reminiscent of reggaeton and dancehall music, but faster. Riddims were built from the song and the sound became a popular part of reggaeton. The rhythm and melodies in dembow music tends to be simple and repetitive.
Ivy Queen was born as Martha Ivelisse Pesante on March 4, 1972, in Añasco, Puerto Rico. After writing raps during her youth and competing in the 90’s at an underground nightclub called The Noise, this led to the beginning of her musical career. She is considered as the “Queen of Reggaeton.” In the beginning of her career, it was very difficult for her to be taken seriously in the reggaeton industry because the genre is seen as misogynistic. After being the first woman to produce hits such as “Quiero Bailar”, “Yo Perreo Sola”, “Pa’ La Cama Voy”, “Te He Querido, Te He Llorado” Ivy Queen gained the respect of women and men alike solidifying her spot as “Queen of Reggaeton”. However, in the past, there had been controversy between herself and reggaetonero/rapper Anuel AA regarding her status as “Queen of Reggaeton” being she had not had a hit in years. He also insinuated that his girlfriend, Karol G, should be the queen of reggaeton. Ivy Queen responded saying her career paved the way for female artists to thrive in this genre. In reaction to the comments made by her boyfriend Anuel AA, Karol G responded with a video, saying “For Becky G, Natti Natasha, Anitta, Ivy Queen and all the women who have shown me respect in all my social networks and interviews: I have had the honor of telling them in person how much I admire their work and careers, but we are all worthy of what we have because nobody has given anything to anyone.” She went on to say, “This is a crown, and nobody is not going to give it to them, for what they have done. I am not looking for a degree, I am only looking for the success of my career, as everyone is doing every day. Getting up for the dream. To my boyfriend, I just want to say thank you, because I know what you wanted to say. I am your queen and I am very happy that you see me that big because you do motivate me. All of us are going to do what we like and work for it.” Ultimately, Anuel AA would make amends with Ivy Queen, and after meeting Ivy Queen, Karol would have Ivy featured on her successful 2021 album “KG0516” on the multi-artist track “Leyendas” (‘Legends’). The track, also featuring Zion, Nicky Jam, and Wisin y Yandel, opens with Ivy Queen singing memorable parts of her biggest song to date, “Yo Quiero Bailar” (‘I want to dance’) before Karol joins in.

Ivy Queen has been an influence on other women like Cardi B and Farina. Even men, such as Bad Bunny, have listed her as an influence for their lyrics. Her ability to compete amongst men who dominated Reggaetón gave hope to other women who had similar interests in the music industry. Her influence and dominance in the genre led the way for women to easier break onto the reggaetón scene. She sparked a place for women&#x27;s empowerment, not just for Puerto Rican women, but for all women who are new to the game.

Karol G is a Colombian reggaeton singer who has done collaborations with artists such as Bad Bunny, Anuel AA and Colombian reggaeton artists J Balvin, and Maluma. Throughout her career, Karol G has had troubles in the industry because reggaeton is a genre that is dominated by males. She recounts how when starting her career she noticed that there were not many opportunities for her in the genre because reggaeton was dominated by male artists. In 2018, Karol G&#x27;s single &quot;Mi Cama&quot; became very popular and she made a remix with J Balvin and Nicky Jam. The Mi cama remix appeared in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs and number 1 in Latin Airplay charts. This year she has collaborated with Maluma on her song &quot;Creeme&quot;, and with her love interest, Anuel AA, in the song &quot;Culpables&quot;. The single, &quot;Culpables&quot; has been in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs for 2 consecutive weeks. On May 3, 2019, Karol G was able to release her new album called “Ocean”.

Natti Natasha is a Dominican reggaeton singer who has also joined the reggaeton industry and has listed Ivy Queen as one of her influences for her music. In 2017 she made a single called &quot;Criminal&quot; that features reggaeton artist, Ozuna. Her single &quot;Criminal&quot; became very popular on YouTube with more than has 1.5 billion views. In 2018 Natti Natasha collaborated with Puerto Rican duo, RKM and Ken Y in their single &quot;Tonta&quot;. She also later collaborated with Mexican reggaeton artist, Becky G in “Sin Pijama” which made it to the top 10 in Hot Latin songs, Latin Airplay, and Latin Pop Airplay charts. After all the collaborations that Natti Natasha has done she was able to release her album called illumiNatti on February 15, 2019. In 2021, she became engaged and pregnant to her longtime manager, Raphy Pina, the Puerto Rican founder of Pina Records who also manages Daddy Yankee. On May 22, 2021, she gave birth to their daughter. Her fiancé is currently serving a three year, five month sentence for illegal possessions of a firearm.

==Caribbean influences==

===Bachata and Bachatón===

Bachata originating in the Dominican Republic, has received notable recognition in Puerto Rico due to its strong cultural ties with the Dominican Republic allowing for a fusion of musical genres. One of the primary influences of early bachata includes Cuban bolero, Cuban Son, American Rock, Blues, Mexican Ranchera, Corrido and merengue. The appearance of Dominican styles of music such as bachata and merengue in reggaetón coincided with the arrival in Puerto Rico of the Dominican-born production team of Luny Tunes—although they are not solely credited for this development. In 2000, they received an opportunity to work in the reggaeton studio of DJ Nelson. They began to produce a string of successful releases for reggaeton artists including Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón and Daddy Yankee. &quot;Pa&#x27; Que Retozen&quot;, one of the first songs to combine bachata and reggaeton appeared on Tego Calderón&#x27;s highly acclaimed &quot;El Abayarde&quot; (2002). It features the unmistakable guitar sounds of Dominican bachata—although, it was not produced by Luny Tunes by DJ Joe. Luny Tunes, however, on their debut studio album, &quot;Mas Flow&quot; (2003) included a hit by Calderón, &quot;Métele Sazón&quot;. It exhibited bachata&#x27;s signature guitar arpeggios as well as merengue&#x27;s characteristic piano riffs. After the initial success of these songs, other artists began to incorporate bachata with reggaeton. Artists such as Ivy Queen began releasing singles that featured bachata&#x27;s signature guitar sound, slower romantic rhythm, and exaggerated emotional singing style. This is reflected in the hits &quot;Te He Querido, Te He Llorado&quot; and &quot;La Mala&quot;. Daddy Yankee&#x27;s &quot;Lo Que Paso, Paso&quot; and Don Omar&#x27;s &quot;Dile&quot; also reflect this. A further use of bachata occurred in 2005 when producers began remixing existing reggaeton with bachata&#x27;s characteristic guitar sounds marketing it as &quot;bachatón&quot; defining it as &quot;bachata, but Puerto Rican style&quot;.

Artists from Puerto Rico and/or of Puerto Rican descent that have been known to experiment with bachata and/or bachatón includes Trébol Clan, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Don Omar, Ozuna, Nicky Jam, Myke Towers, Bad Bunny, Romeo Santos, Toby Love, Alejandra Feliz, Yolandita Monge, Sonya Cortés, Domenic Marte, Tego Calderón, Héctor el Father, Tito El Bambino, Wisin &amp; Yandel, Angel &amp; Khriz, Chayanne, Ricky Martin, amongst many others.

===Bolero===

Although bolero has its origins in Cuba, it had already reached Puerto Rico in the 20th century where it was popularized on the island through the first radio stations in 1915 and was being both enjoyed as well as composed and performed by Puerto Ricans, including such outstanding figures as Rafael Hernández, Daniel Santos, Pedro Flores, Johnny Albino, Odilio González, Noel Estrada, José Feliciano, Trio Vegabajeño, and Tito Rodríguez, amongst many others. Similar to the bolero genre in Cuba, the bolero in Puerto Rico is usually combined with other genres of Cuban and Puerto Rican origin, such as bomba, danza, plena, jíbaro, guaracha, mambo, rumba, cha-cha-cha, and salsa.

===Merengue===

Although merengue is a type of music and dance that has its origins and also carries a very strong association with the Dominican Republic, it became widespread throughout Latin America and the United States, including Puerto Rico. The choreography of the ballroom merengue is a basic side two-step, but with a difficult twist of the hip to the right, which makes it somewhat hard to perform. The two dance partners get into a vals, or waltz-like position. The couple then side steps, known as a Paso de la empalizada or &quot;stick-fence step,&quot; followed by either a clockwise or counter-clockwise turn. During all of the dance steps of the ballroom merengue, the couple never separates. The second kind of merengue is called the Figure Meringue or Merengue de Figura. The performing couple makes individual turns without releasing the hands of the partner and still keeping the rhythm of the beat. Popular merengue performers from Puerto Rico include Elvis Crespo, Olga Tañón, Gisselle, Manny Manuel, Grupo Mania, Limi-T 21, amongst many others. Merenhouse, which is a subgenre of merengue that is formed by rapping and includes influences of hip-hop, dancehall, and latin house was formed in New York City in the late 1980s. Lisa M, who was the first major female Latin rapper that was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico is often credited for making the first song in the merenhouse genre. Mostly credited on her second album No Lo Derrumbes, which was released in 1990.

===Guaracha and Salsa===

Salsa is another genre whose form derived from the Cuban/Puerto Rican melding of the genre, especially Cuban dance music of the 1950s—but which in the 1960s–70s became an international genre, cultivated with special zeal and excellence in Puerto Rico and by Puerto Ricans in New York City. Forms such as the Charanga were hugely popular with Puerto Ricans and Nuyoricans who, in effect, rescued this genre which had been stagnating and limited to only Cuba in the 1960s, giving it new life, new social significance, and many new stylistic innovations. Salsa is the name acquired by the modernized form of Cuban/Puerto Rican-style dance music that was cultivated and rearticulated starting in the late 1960s by Puerto Ricans in New York City and, subsequently, in Puerto Rico and elsewhere. While salsa soon became an international phenomenon, thriving in Colombia, Venezuela, and elsewhere, New York and Puerto Rico remained its two epicenters. Particularly prominent on the island were El Gran Combo, Sonora Ponceña, and Willie Rosario, as well as the more pop-oriented &quot;salsa romántica&quot; stars of the 1980s–90s. (For further information see the entry on &quot;salsa music.&quot;)

Other popular Nuyorican and Puerto Rican exposers of these genres have been Tito Puente, Tito Rodríguez (guaracha and bolero singer), pianists Eddie Palmieri, Richie Ray and Papo Lucca, conguero Ray Barreto, trombonist and singer Willie Colón, and singers La India, Andy Montañez, Bobby Cruz, Cheo Feliciano, Héctor Lavoe, Ismael Miranda, Ismael Rivera, Tito Nieves, Pete &quot;El Conde&quot; Rodríguez and Gilberto Santa Rosa.

===Reggae and Dancehall===

Puerto Rico has had its music scene for both reggae and dancehall artists, in addition to the local reggaetón genre, which had evolved in Puerto Rico primarily through reggae and dancehall influences from Panama and Jamaica. Local artists and bands such as Cultura Profética, Millo Torres y El Tercer Planeta, and Gomba Jahbari have received notable recognition on the island, as well as other reggae and dancehall acts in Puerto Rico. Reggae in Puerto Rico uses elements such as intricate horn arrangements and chord progressions to distinguish it from other styles of reggae, most notably Jamaican reggae. It is also sung primarily in Spanish and/or English, although Puerto Rican reggae can also be sung in other languages as well. Their variation of reggae has also been influenced by other music genres such as salsa, which originated in Puerto Rico, and jazz music which came from the United States, as their local reggae and dancehall musicians like to experiment with other genres and combine them with their style of reggae.

==Classical music==
The island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, attracting classical musicians from around the world. Since the nineteenth century there have been diverse Puerto Rican composers, including Felipe Gutierrez Espinosa, Manuel Gregorio Tavárez, Juan Morel Campos, Aristides Chavier, Julio C. Arteaga, and Braulio Dueño Colón. At the beginning of the 20th century, we find José Ignacio Quintón, Monsita Ferrer, and José Enrique Pedreira. Moving to the mid-20th century a new wave of composers appeared, some of them with a significant degree of nationalism. In this group are Amaury Veray, Héctor Campos Parsi, Jack Delano and Luis Antonio Ramírez. With more contemporary languages comes the musical scene of Rafael Aponte-Ledée and Luis Manuel Álvarez. From the 1970s on, a fair number of musicians add to the list, and, though, with different styles, they all had an imposing international flavor. Ernesto Cordero, Carlos Alberto Vázquez, Alfonso Fuentes, Raymond Torres-Santos, Alberto Rodríguez, William Ortiz-Alvarado, José Javier Peña Aguayo, Carlos Carrillo and Roberto Sierra belong to this group.

==Hip-Hop and Rap music==
As social conditions and urban decay took their toll on the projects in New York City during the 1970s, blacks, and Puerto Ricans were equally affected. As a way of coping with the disarray that was taking place in New York, both Puerto Ricans and blacks worked together to collaborate on rap music that would help express their creative art. As Deborah Pacini Hernandez wrote in her article, &quot;Oye Como Va! Hybridity and Identity in Latino Popular Music,&quot; many of the ways that blacks and Puerto Ricans coped with their struggles was through, &quot;graffiti, DJing, emceeing, break dancing, and fashion—the cultural elements comprising hip-hop.&quot; (56) As hip-hop music rose to prominence, it was clear that Puerto Ricans had an influence on the hip-hop industry, from the break dancing to the sound of the music.&quot;To speak of Puerto Ricans in rap means to defy the sense of instant amnesia that engulfs popular cultural expression once it is caught up in the logic of commercial representation. It involves sketching in historical contexts and sequences, tracing traditions and antecedents, and recognizing hip-hop to be more and different than the simulated images, poses, and formulas the public discourse of media entertainment tends to reduce it to. The decade and more of hindsight provided by the Puerto Rican involvement shows that, rather than a new musical genre and its accompanying stylistic trappings, rap constitutes a space for the articulation of social experience. From this perspective, what has emerged as “Latin rap” first took shape as an expression of the cultural turf shared, and contended for, by African Americans and Puerto Ricans over their decades as neighbors, coworkers, and “homies” in the inner-city communities.&quot; – Juan Flores, Puerto Rocks: Rap, Roots and AmnesiaDespite the fact that Puerto Ricans had a huge impact on the rise of hip-hop during the late 1970s, they struggled to receive credit as hip-hop was portrayed through the media as a genre that was predominantly black. Instead of switching genres, they had to find other ways to mask their cultural identities. For example, DJ Charlie Chase was one of the first Puerto Rican artists to burst onto the scene with his group, the Cold Crush Brothers, but was the only person in the original group who was not black. He said that he knew he had to change his name because if he went out to perform as Carlos Mendes, he might not have gotten the credit or attention that he deserved.

However, rappers such as DJ Charlie Chase set the scene for more mainstream success in the future. Because of the development of Puerto Ricans in hip-hop, artists like Big Pun, Daddy Yankee, Fat Joe, Swizz Beats, Young MA, Calle 13 (band) have become more successful. Lin-Manuel Miranda achieved universal acclaim with his opera-musical Hamilton (musical), which blends rap and classical influences.

==Dance==
Dance is a performing art related to expressing one&#x27;s ideas and values. The activity is associated with exercise because of the required movements required to execute specific dance patterns. In Puerto Rico, dance is considered to be a part of the culture that is passed on from generation to generation and practiced at family and community parties and celebrations.

===Historical influences===

Dance has been influenced by the different cultures of the Taíno natives, the Spaniards, and the African slaves. Since pre-Columbian times, dance has always been part of the culture of Puerto Rico and has evolved according to social and demographic changes. The earliest dances documented by the early historians were the Taíno &quot;areyto&quot; dances that were chanted by a chorus, set to music, and led by a guide. They practiced storytelling while the guide indicated the steps and songs that were to be repeated until the story was finished. Dances of European origin also became popular among the country folk and the settlers of the central part of the island and rapidly acquired unique features of rhythm, instrumentation, interpretation, and even fashion.

As the population of the Taíno dwindled, Spanish, African, and, from 1898 on, North American dances appeared on the island and took root and developed in the mountains, on the coast, and in the cities.

After the island was taken over by Spain, the music and the dance of Puerto Rico consisted of a combination of harmonious musical styles that are borrowed from Spanish, African, and other European cultures, creating Puerto Rico&#x27;s signature style of Latin dance.

===Salsa===
It refers to the mixture of different rhythms composed of different Latin, African, and Caribbean dances. Salsa is said to be first created around the 1960s and became popular in the non-Latino world drastically. The salsa dance is similar to the mambo dance.

Salsa dancing is structured in six-step patterns phrased on 8 counts of the music. The 8 different steps include 6 moves with 2 pauses. The pattern of the dance is 1,2,3 and pause for 4, move for 5,6,7, and pause for 8. The basic steps are (1) the forward and backward: this step consists of two rock steps going in and out of the moves. The second step is known as the basic side dance step, it is similar to the first step except for this step, the moves are towards the side. The side-to-side feels and turns are significant aspects of the salsa dance.

===Cha Cha Chá===
The Cha Cha Chá dance originated in Cuba. The dance revolves around a common time rhythm, typically transcribed as &quot;rock step, triple step, and then rock step&quot; or &quot;1,2,3 Cha Cha Chá.&quot; The second category is known as the Cha Cha Chá side basic, the most often used basic move of the dance. It is similar to the previous one except for the triple step to the side rather than in place. The third step is known as the &quot;underarm in Cha Cha Chá&quot; and shows how to do the lady&#x27;s underarm steps to the right. Based on the previous step, men might not struggle, but women must know the exact turning spot. The dance is named after the scraping sounds that are produced by the feet of the dancers.

<doc id="242989" wikidata="Q16931684" url="?curid=242989" title="Music of the Bahamas">
<text>The music of the Bahamas is associated primarily with Junkanoo, a celebration which occurs on Boxing Day and again on New Year&#x27;s Day. Parades and other celebrations mark the ceremony. Groups like The Baha Men, Ronnie Butler,Kirkland Bodie and Twindem have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and other places. Other popular Bahamian artists include Stileet and Stevie S.

== Calypso ==
Calypso is a style of Afro-Caribbean music which originated in Trinidad and Tobago. This form of music has spread through many parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas.

== Soca ==
Soca is a form of dance music which originated from many calypso music in Trinidad and Tobago. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from various Anglophone Caribbean countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, United States Virgin Islands, the Bahamas, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Belize.

== Junkanoo ==

The word &quot;Junkanoo&quot; is said to be derived from a Ghanaian leader, John Connu, or from the Qujo supreme deity (Canno) and ancestral spirits (jannanin). The junkanoo is still practiced in North Carolina and remnants still exist in Belize. It is most well known, though, from Nassau and Freeport. Since the 1950s the influence of American culture has increased, mainly through TV and radio broadcasts from Florida stations, and other Caribbean styles have made inroads: calypso, reggae and soca, from Jamaica, Cuba, Trinidad, and other islands. Tourism has also had an impact, bringing in Japanese, European and North Americans with their attendant forms of cultural expression. In this milieu more traditional Bahamas performers such as Joseph Spence, have still enjoyed successful careers playing junkanoo, Christian hymns and the &quot;ant&#x27;ems&quot; of the local sponge fishermen, which include &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, later made famous by The Beach Boys.

In 1973, the year the Bahamas achieved independence from the United Kingdom, black professionals of the middle and upper classes began to dominate junkanoo celebrations. Costuming and competitions became more complex and commonplace, and soon became a tourist draw.

Aside from being a type of drum, goombay is also a percussion music made famous by Alphonso &#x27;Blind Blake&#x27; Higgs, who played to tourists arriving at Nassau International Airport for several years. Rake-and-scrape music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a screwdriver; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like polka and waltz. Rake-and-scrape&#x27;s popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like Lassie Do and the Boys continue to keep the tradition alive. Christian rhyming spirituals and the &quot;ant&#x27;ems&quot; of sponge fishermen are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a 1930s sponge blight and other causes.

E. Clement Bethel&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter, Nicolette Bethel and Philip A. Burrows. &quot;Music of The Bahamas&quot; was first performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences. A recording of that show is available for sale from Ringplay Productions.

==Rake and scrape==

Rake and scrape music is played traditionally with concertinas, Goombay drums, and a handsaw. Rake and scrape is believed to have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.

==Organology of instruments==

Membranophones: The Goombay drum is the main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape. It is also referred to a goatskin drum, as the skin of a goat was stretched over a wooden barrel. It is decorated by simple or complex geometric designs in bright colors. The drum is always heated over fire to retain its tone. In 1971, when manufacturers started shipping products in metal barrels, Bahamians switched the drum to metal, slightly changing the tone of the drum.

Idiophones: The main component that makes Rake-N-Scrape unique is the use of the Carpenter&#x27;s Saw. This instrument is scraped with a nail or butter knife. Bent against the body of the player and flexed, various timbral effects are obtained. In more modern music, the saw is replaced with maracas or a guiro.

Aerophones: The accordion is the component that adds the round form which enables dancers to dance the ring dance. This is of European descent. In more modern bands, it is replaced by an electric guitar or electronic keyboard.

<doc id="243003" wikidata="Q3328766" url="?curid=243003" title="Music of Slovenia">
<text>In the minds of many foreigners, Slovenian folk music means a form of polka that is still popular today, especially among expatriates and their descendants. However, there are many styles of Slovenian folk music beyond polka and waltz. , , , and are a few of the traditional music styles and dances.

==Prehistory==
The Divje Babe flute, a perforated bone found in a cave at the Divje Babe site Cerkno, Slovenia. It is controversially believed to be a flute, which makes it possibly the oldest known musical instrument ever. Its age is estimated at approximately 55,000 years.

The history of modern Slovenian music can be traced back to the 5th century, when Christianity spread in Carantania. Liturgical hymns (&quot;kyrie Eleison&quot;) were introduced, and became the first plainchant to make a connection to the peoples&#x27; language.

== Classical music ==

===Medieval===
During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering minnesingers. 

George Slatkonia, a Carniolan conductor and composer from Novo Mesto, became the director of the Vienna Boys&#x27; Choir in 1498. 

=== Renaissance ===
By the time of Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize in Carniola. The first Slovenian hymnal, &quot;Eni Psalmi&quot;, was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of Renaissance musicians like Jacobus Gallus. Italy was an important musical influence of the period, especially in sacred music, such as that of Antonio Tarsia (composer) of Koper, in oratorio and opera. A &quot;Commedia&quot; was performed in Ljubljana in 1660, and an opera in 1700 in the family palace of the Auersperg family.

===Enlightenment===
In 1701, Johann Berthold von Höffer (1667–1718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis based on Italian models. and the Ljubljana branch of the Roman Academy of Arcadia was founded a few years later in 1709. Apart from Höffer, the Cathedral provost Michael Omerza was also noted for his oratorios. The first major Slovenian opera was performed in 1732, &quot;Il Tamerlano&quot; by &quot;abbate&quot; Giuseppe Clemente de Bonomi, maestro di Capella, in the palace of the Carniolan vice-regent, the duke Francesco Antonio Sigifrid Della Torre e Valassina.
Beginning in 1768, German theatre companies arrived and became very popular. The 1794 formation of the Philharmonische Gesellschaft was important because it was one of the first such orchestras in Central Europe.

===19th century===
The 19th century saw the growth of a distinctively Slovenian classical music sound based on romanticism, while the German minority continued to push for a stronger Germanic identity. The Ljubljana opera house (1892) was shared by Slovene and German opera companies.

Composers of Slovenian Lieder and art songs include Emil Adamič (1877–1936), Fran Gerbič (1840–1917), Alojz Geržinič (1915–2008), Benjamin Ipavec (1829–1908), Davorin Jenko (1835–1914), Anton Lajovic (1878–1960), Kamilo Mašek (1831–1859), Josip Pavčič (1870–1949), Zorko Prelovec (1887–1939), and Lucijan Marija Škerjanc (1900–1973).

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, impressionism was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers Marij Kogoj and Slavko Osterc.

Avant-garde classical music arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of Uroš Krek, Dane Škerl, Primož Ramovš and Ivo Petrić, who also conducted the Slavko Osterc Ensemble. Jakob Jež, Darijan Božič, Lojze Lebič and Vinko Globokar have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Armonia&quot;, an opera. In the 1950s, Božidar Kantušer was the most progressive of all, by dint of his atonality.

===Contemporary===
Contemporary classic music composers include Uroš Rojko, Tomaž Svete, Brina Jež-Brezavšček and Aldo Kumar.

==Opera==

The Slovenian National Theatres in Maribor and Ljubljana serve as the national opera and ballet houses. Mezzo-soprano Marjana Lipovšek was born in Ljubljana.

==Film music==

The composer of film scores for 170 films was Bojan Adamič (1912–1995).

== Folk music ==

===Vocal===
Rural harmony singing is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor.

===Instrumental===
Typical Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, zithers, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In eastern Slovenia, fiddle and cimbalon bands are called velike goslarije. Traditional Slovenian music include various kinds of musical instruments such as:
*Steirische Harmonika
*Kontra
*Hammered dulcimer
*Cimbalon grande
*Drone zither
*Violin zither
*Zither
*Tamburica
*Fiddle
*Carnian fiddle
*Cello
*Brunkula cello
*Gaida
*Brass instruments, such as baritone horn
*Clarinet
*Jaw harp
*Clay pot bass
*Okarina
*Akelêmb
*Klopotec
*Panpipes
*Wooden cross flutes of various sizes
*Psaltery
*Tambourine

Folk music revivalists include Volk Volk, Kurja Koža, Marko Banda, Katice, Bogdana Herman, Ljoba Jenče, Vruja, Trinajsto praše, Šavrinske pupe en ragacone, Musicante Istriani, and Tolovaj Mataj.

One of the best Slovenian diatonic accordionists is Nejc Pačnik who won the accordion world-championship twice, in 2009 and 2015.

===Slovenian pop-folk music===

From 1952 on, the Slavko Avsenik&#x27;s band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the West Germany, inventing the original &quot;Oberkrainer&quot; sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and in the Benelux, spawning hundreds of Alpine orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the Slovenian-style polka legacy. Avsenik&#x27;s most popular &quot;instrumental&quot; composition is the polka that is titled &quot;Na Golici&quot; (in Slovene), or &quot;Trompetenecho&quot; (in German), and &quot;Trumpet Echoes&quot; (in English). Oberkrainer music, which the Avsenik Ensemble popularized, is always a strong candidate for pop-folk music awards in Slovenia and Austria. Slavko and his brother, Vilko, are usually credited as the pioneers of Slovenian folk music, having solidified its style in the 1950s.

Many musicians followed Avsenik&#x27;s steps, one of the most famous being Lojze Slak.

==Slovenian song festival==
A similarly high standing in Slovene culture, like the Sanremo Music Festival has had in Italian culture, was attributed to the coastal Melodies of Sea and Sun (In Slovene: ) and Slovenian song festival (In Slovene: ), dedicated to a specific genre of popular Slovene music.

== Popular music ==

=== Contemporary music ===

Among pop, rock, industrial, and indie musicians the most popular in Slovenia include Laibach, an early 1980s industrial music group, and most recently the Slovenian pop a cappella band Perpetuum Jazzile.

====Pop, rock, metal, and indie music====
Other popular bands, most largely unknown outside the country, include Tabu, ManuElla, Društvo Mrtvih Pesnikov (pop-rock), Siddharta, Rok &#x27;n&#x27; Band, Pop Design, Fredi Miler, Terrafolk, Leaf Fat (screamo), Amaya, Šank Rock, Big Foot Mama, Yogurt, Dan D, Zablujena generacija, Katalena, Devil Doll (experimental rock), Negligence (band), Chateau, Čuki, Zaklonišče Prepeva, Psycho-Path, Dekadent (black metal), Buldožer (progressive rock) and Joker Out. The deathcore band Within Destruction have released two-full-length albums and have partaken in several European tours; the band is based in Jesenice.

====Singer-songwriters====
Slovenian post-WWII singer-songwriters include Frane Milčinski (1914–1988), Tomaž Pengov whose 1973 album &quot;Odpotovanja&quot; is considered to be the first singer-songwriter album in former Yugoslavia, Tomaž Domicelj, Marko Brecelj, Andrej Šifrer, Eva Sršen, Neca Falk, and Jani Kovačič. After 1990, Adi Smolar, Iztok Mlakar, Vita Mavrič, Vlado Kreslin, Zoran Predin, Peter Lovšin, and Magnifico have been popular in Slovenia, as well.

====World music====
The 1970s Bratko Bibič&#x27;s band Begnagrad is considered one of the direct influences on modern world music. Bibič&#x27;s unique accordion style, often solo, with no accompaniment, has also made him a solo star.

====Punk rock====
Slovenia was the center for punk rock in the Titoist Yugoslavia. The most famous representatives of this genre were Pankrti, Niet, Lublanski Psi, Kuzle, Čao Pičke, Via Ofenziva, Tožibabe, and Otroci Socializma.

====Techno and tech-house====
Slovenia has also produced two renowned DJs: DJ Umek and Valentino Kanzyani. Specialising in a frantic brand of party techno and tech-house, the pair co-founded the label Recycled Loops as well as having many releases on labels such as Novamute, Primate, Intec and Bassethound Records.

====Neue Slowenische Kunst====

Neue Slowenische Kunst (a German phrase meaning &quot;New Slovenian Art&quot;), aka NSK, is a controversial political art collective that announced itself in Slovenia in 1984, when Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia. NSK&#x27;s name, being German, is compatible with a theme in NSK works: the complicated relationship Slovenes have had with Germans. The name of NSK&#x27;s music wing, Laibach, is also the German name of the Slovene capital Ljubljana, creating controversy through evoking memories of the Nazi occupation of Slovenia during the Second World War.

=====Composition=====

NSK&#x27;s best-known member is the musical group Laibach. Other NSK member groups include IRWIN (visual art), Noordung (theater; originally named Scipion Nasice Sisters Theatre, also known as Red Pilot), New Collective Studio (graphics; also known as New Collectivism), Retrovision (film and video), and the Department of Pure and Applied Philosophy (theory). The founding groups of the NSK were Laibach, IRWIN, and Scipion Našice Sisters Theater.

=====Characteristics=====
NSK art often draws on symbols drawn from totalitarian or extreme nationalist movements, often reappropriating totalitarian kitsch in a visual style reminiscent of Dada. NSK artists often symbols from different (and often incompatible) political ideologies. For example, a 1987 NSK-designed poster caused a scandal by winning a competition for the Yugoslavian Youth Day Celebration. The poster appropriated a painting by Nazi artist Richard Klein, replacing the flag of Nazi Germany with the Yugoslav flag and the German eagle with a dove.

Both IRWIN and Laibach are emphatic about their work being collective rather than individual. Laibach&#x27;s original songs and arrangements are always credited to the group collectively; the individual artists are not named on their album covers; at one point, there were even two separate Laibach groups touring at the same time, both with members of the original group. Similarly, the IRWIN artists never sign their work individually; instead, they are &quot;signed&quot; with a stamp or indicating approval as a work from the IRWIN collective.

The NSK were the subject of a 1996 documentary film written and directed by Michael Benson, entitled &quot;Prerokbe Ognja&quot; in Slovenian, or &quot;Predictions of Fire&quot; in English. Among those interviewed in the film is Slovenian intellectual Slavoj Žižek.

=====NSK State=====
Since 1991, NSK has claimed to constitute a state, a claim similar to that of micronations. They issue passports, have presented shows of their work in the guise of an embassy or even as a territory of their supposed state, and maintain consulates in several cities including Umag, Croatia. NSK have also issued postage stamps. Laibach, in 2006, recorded (some may say &#x27;remixed&#x27;) the NSK State National Anthem on the LP &quot;Volk.&quot; The &quot;anthem&quot; adopts its melody from another Laibach song, &quot;The Great Seal.&quot; Laibach&#x27;s version of the NSK anthem includes a computer voice reciting an excerpt from Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous &quot;We shall fight them on the beaches/We shall never surrender&quot; speech. The computer voice is clearly recognisable as the voice synthesiser Macintalk, built into classic Mac OS, and uses the preset voice Ralph.

The NSK passports are an art project and as such are not valid for travel. However, many desperate people have fallen for a scam in which they are issued a NSK passport. Most of these scams originate in Nigeria and Egypt.

=====Laibach=====
Laibach is a Slovenian avant-garde music group strongly associated with martial, and neo-classical musical styles. Laibach formed 1 June 1980 in Trbovlje, Slovenia (then Yugoslavia). Laibach represents the music wing of the &quot;Neue Slowenische Kunst&quot; (NSK) art collective, of which it was a founding member in 1984. The name &quot;Laibach&quot; is the German name for Slovenia&#x27;s capital city, Ljubljana.

<doc id="243011" wikidata="Q1236268" url="?curid=243011" title="Music of Croatia">
<text>The music of [[Croatia]], like the divisions of the country itself, has two major influences: Central European, present in central and northern parts of the country including Slavonia, and Mediterranean, present in coastal regions of Dalmatia and Istria.

In Croatia both pop and rock are popular, as well as pop music influenced by Dalmatian or Slavonian folk elements.

Since the mid-20th century, schlager and chanson-inspired music have formed the backbone of the Croatian popular music.

==History of music in Croatia==
===Medieval===
The oldest preserved relics of musical culture in Croatia are sacral in nature and represented by &quot;Latin medieval liturgical chant manuscripts&quot; (approximately one hundred musical codices and fragments dating from the 11th to the 15th centuries have been preserved to date). They reveal a wealth of various influences and liturgical traditions that converged in this region (Dalmatian liturgy in &quot;Benevento script&quot;, Northern Gregorian chant, and original &quot;Glagolitic chant&quot;).

===Renaissance and baroque===

Early in the 15th century, the ideas of Humanism in Croatia brought about changes to the world of music. Interest in music began to spread outside of monastic and church walls with growing influence of new spiritual tendencies from Central European and particularly Italian cities. Humanists and philosophers promulgated new musical theories and aesthetic ideas: Federik Grisogono, Pavao Skalić, Frane Petrić. The writing down of folk and popular music began in mid-sixteenth century: in the poem &quot;Fishing and Fishermen&#x27;s Talk&quot; from 1558, Petar Hektorović ingrained Neoplatonic ideals in popular music; and transcripts of Croatian musical folklore were printed in Venetian anthologies (&quot;Giulio Cesare Barbetta&quot; 1569, Marco Facoli 1588). &quot;Julije Skjavetić&quot; from Šibenik published his madrigals (&quot;Li madrigali a quattro, et a cinque voci&quot; 1562), while his &quot;Motetti a cinque et a sei voci&quot;, (1564) are characterised by a lavish polyphonic structure under the influence of the Dutch school. Music and dance were a component part of theatrical expression (Mavro Vetranović, &quot;Nikola Nalješković&quot;, Marin Držić, &quot;Marin Benetović&quot;), while the function of music and sound effects was under the influence of &quot;Italian pastorals&quot;.

The most prominent Croatian composers of this period include Ivan Lukačić, Vinko Jelić and Atanazije Jurjević.

New tendencies of early Baroque monody soon found their way into the domestic musical tradition, both sacral and secular. &quot;Tomaso Cecchini&quot;, from Verona, who spent his entire working life (1603–44) as a choirmaster, organist and composer in Split and Hvar, published his madrigals &quot;Armonici concetti, libro primo&quot; (1612) as the oldest Baroque collection written for the Croatian milieu. The collection &quot;Sacrae cantiones&quot; (Venice 1620) by Ivan Lukačić from Šibenik is valuable testimony of sacral music that was performed in Split, and is generally speaking, one of the most significant monuments of old Croatian music altogether. The Franciscans and Paulists cultivated sacral chants, mostly monophonic and without organ accompaniment (the manuscript cantos of Frane Divnić, Bone Razmilović, Filip Vlahović-Kapušvarac, Franjo Vukovarac and Petar Knežević). Also, worth mentioning is Ragusino Vincenzo Comnen, the only representative of the music of the Dubrovnik nobility.

The tradition of the Baroque was more lasting in church/sacral music, which was the musical form that was systematically nurtured in numerous monasteries (especially Franciscan ones) as well as in parish and cathedral churches. The preservation of music manuscripts and prints became a widespread practice in the mid-18th century. Simple vocal-instrumental music for two voices with organ continuo was the form most frequently performed in churches; more prominent individuals active in the sphere of music could be found only in larger urban centres. They were mostly organists and &quot;maestri di cappella&quot;, skilful composers who had small vocal and/or instrumental ensembles and who frequently acted as music teachers (private or in church schools). The gradual development of the middle class had as one of its consequences the corresponding secular organisation of musical life, particularly in the first decades of the 19th century, a period that saw the establishment of music ensembles, music societies (1827 in Zagreb, then in Varaždin, Rijeka, Osijek etc.) and music schools.

In addition, public balls and other events were organised (music academies, theatre performances) with the participation of local and foreign musicians (from Italy, Austria, Bohemia etc.) including the private collection of music materials for playing music at home. Music became a component part of various festivities, such as the arrival of important political personalities (the new governor or the Habsburg king Frances I, etc.), the feasts of patron saints (&quot;St. Blaise&quot; in Dubrovnik, &quot;St. Domnius&quot; in Split, &quot;St. Stephen&quot; in Hvar and Zagreb etc.), for which so called art music was specifically composed, with the inclusion of popular elements (bourgeois dances, folk music of the peasantry).

===Romanticism===
Many Italian and domestic musicians worked in Dubrovnik: in the cathedral choir and orchestra, in the Duke&#x27;s orchestra, at private and public festivities. An excellent early example of pre-classical symphony and chamber music was given by Luka Sorkočević, a nobleman educated in Rome, as well as his son Antun, a historian and diplomat.

Ferdo Livadić (1799–1879) wrote &quot;Notturno in F-sharp minor&quot; for piano as early as 1822, which is, along with John Field&#x27;s compositions under the same name, one of the earliest examples of that type of piano miniatures in general.

In the course of the 1830s, as a reflection of such tendencies in Europe, the Illyrian Movement emerged in Croatia which assigned not only to literature but to music as well a particular socio-political role: the forming and guarding of national awareness including the struggle against Hungarization and Germanization. Accordingly, in 1846 Josip Runjanin (1821–1878) put to music Antun Mihanović&#x27;s 1835 poem &quot;Horvatska domovina&quot; (Croatian Homeland), which later became the Croatian national anthem. In such a setting Vatroslav Lisinski (1819–1854) composed the first Croatian national opera &quot;Ljubav i zloba&quot; (Love and Malice), which premièred in Zagreb in 1846.

Taking into consideration the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians went far beyond the results achieved, something that is also continued in the work of Ivan Zajc (1832–1914) in the second half of the century. His masterpiece, the opera Nikola Šubić Zrinjski, ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia&#x27;s victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno-musicology and musical historiography, Franjo Kuhač (1834–1911), the systematic research of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc&#x27;s endeavours. In Zajc&#x27;s and Kuhač&#x27;s era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the &quot;Croatian Music Institute&quot; (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the Croatian National Theatre (1895), including the theatre buildings in Rijeka (1885), Split (1893) and Osijek (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today.

During the 19th century, other instrumentalists and singers won international recognition, for example, the violinist Franjo Krežma (1862–1881), singers, among which Ilma Murska (1834–1889), Matilda Mallinger (1847–1920) who sang at the opening night of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; in 1868, Milka Trnina (1863–1941) and Josip Kašman (1850–1925), the first Croatian singer to appear at the New York Metropolitan Opera.

==Folk music==

The traditional folk music of Croatia is mostly associated with the following:

===Ganga===
Ganga is a type of singing which is characterized by a lone singer singing one line of lyrics and then others joining in for what can be best described as a wail. It is a very passionate form of singing, which is one of the reasons it has been limited in popularity to small towns. Even though it is a unique and autochthonous form of singing by Croats, it is very rare to hear this music on Croatian airwaves. However, several popular Croatian musicians have incorporated some ganga into their work. It can also be heard in concert music: the American composer Craig Walsh incorporates a ganga-inspired wailing, sighing, pitch-bending, micro-tonal vocal style in his &#x27;String Quartet No. 1&#x27; (2010), a work commissioned for the Sarajevo Chamber Music Festival and the Manhattan String Quartet, the second movement of which is clearly paying homage to ganga style.

Only recently has ganga begun to address political issues, frequently adopting overtly nationalistic overtones and incorporating themes from the Croatian Homeland War. Although both men and women regularly perform ganga, it is extremely unusual for them to perform songs together. It is not unusual at all for both Catholic and Muslim men to perform ganga together.

===Klapa===

The klapa music is a form of a cappella singing that first appeared in littoral Croatia during the middle of the 19th century. The word &quot;klapa&quot; is derived from a word in slang Italian spoken in Trieste at the time. It refers to &quot;a group of people&quot; and the singing style traces its roots to liturgical church singing. The motifs, in general, celebrate love, wine (grapes), country (homeland) and sea. The main elements of the music are harmony and melody, with rhythm very rarely being very important.

A klapa group consists of a first tenor, a second tenor, a baritone, and a bass. It is possible to double all the voices apart from the first tenor. Although klapa is a cappella music, on occasion, it is possible to add a gentle guitar and a mandolin.

Klapa singing has become increasingly popular in littoral Croatia. Many young people from Dalmatia treasure klapa and sing it regularly when going out eating/drinking. This music has gained popularity among mainstream audiences in coastal regions of Croatia, with newer klapa formed by younger generations fusing klapa vocals with other music styles, such as klapa Libar&#x27;s metal cover of &quot;Pusti da ti leut svira&quot; and the pop/klapa song &quot;Kako ću joj reć&#x27; da varin&quot; by klapa DVD-a Žrnovnica Sv. Florijan, which won the Split Song Festival in 2010.

===Tamburica===

Tamburica (diminutive of tambura) music is a form of folk music that involves these and related string instruments. It became increasingly popular in the 1800s, and small bands began to form, paralleling similar developments in Russia, Italy and Ukraine.

The main themes of tamburitza songs are the common themes of love and happy village life. Tamburitza music is primarily associated with the northern, Pannonian part of the country. It is sometimes said that the first sextet of tambura players was formed by Pajo Kolarić of Osijek in 1847. In 1971 one of the most famous and long lasting tamburitza ensembles Slavonski Bećari was formed led by the legend of tamburitza music Antun Nikolić Tuca.

Traditional tamburitza ensembles are still commonplace, but more professional groups have formed in the last few decades. These include Zlatni dukati and Ex Panonia, the first such groups, Zdenac, Slavonske Lole, Berde Band and the modernized rock and roll-influenced Gazde.

The style of Tambura music played most often in the United States during the latter half of the 20th century was not significantly different from the style played at the turn of the 19th century. Free of the influences of pop music in Jugoslavia and the nascent, independent republics, and without large quantities of immigrants bringing new methods and styles, American-style Tambura music, and to a lesser extent, Canadian-style Tambura music stayed true to its roots.

Today, the most prevalent forms of Tambura music are folk-pop combinations.

===Gusle===

The gusle music is played on this traditional string instrument. It is primarily rooted in epic poetry with emphasis on important historical or patriotic events. It is the traditional instrument of inland Dalmatia and of Herzegovina, the part of Bosnia and Herzegovina with predominant Croatian population.

Gusle players are known for glorifying outlaws such as hajduks or uskoks of the long gone Turkish reign or exalting the recent heroes of the Croatian War of Independence. Andrija Kačić Miošić, a famous 18th-century author, had also composed verses in form of the traditional folk poetry (&quot;deseterac&quot;, ten verses). His book &quot;Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog&quot; became Croatian folk Bible which inspired numerous gusle players ever since.

As for contemporary gusle players in Croatia, one person that particularly stands out is Mile Krajina. Krajina is a prolific folk poet and gusle player who gained cult status among some conservative groups. There are also several other prominent Croatian gusle players who often perform at various folk-festivals throughout Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

===Diple===

Diple is a traditional woodwind musical instrument in Croatian music. Sometimes called &quot;Mih&quot;, &quot;mjeh&quot;, &quot;mjesina&quot; or only &quot;diple&quot;, it is played from Istria, Lika, over Dalmatia Islands and Coast to Herzegovina. &quot;Mih&quot; is made of tanned goat or sheep skin and consists of a &quot;dulac&quot; or &quot;kanela&quot; through which the air is blown and &quot;diple&quot; (chanter) on which it is played. Inside the &quot;mih&quot; on the chanter, two single-blade reeds are situated. Unlike bagpipes, &quot;Mih&quot; doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;trubanj&quot; or &quot;bordun&quot; (drone). Although they are very similar, the &quot;mih&quot; from different parts of Croatia still differ in type of chanter, in the position of holes or in some tiny details (for example ornaments).

===Other folk traditions===

The folk music of Zagorje, an area north of Zagreb, is known for small orchestras consisting of Violins, Cimbule, Tamburice and Harmonike. The Tamburica (also known as tambura) is the Croatian national string instrument. Although there is a rich pool of folk songs in this region, traditions are not being cherished and most Zagorian folk music available is performed by amateur groups. This is also reflected in the quality of the music, which is mostly reduced to happy upbeat songs.

The folk music of Međimurje, a small but distinct region in northernmost Croatia, with its melancholic and soothing tunes became the most popular form of folk to be used in the modern &quot;ethno&quot; pop-rock songs. Beside Cimbule and Violins, there is also a tradition of Brass orchestras which used to play an important role in cultural everyday life. On one hand, they were the foundation of every regional celebration or wedding but on the other hand they were also known for playing at funerals or funeral feasts.

In Istria and Kvarner, native instruments like sopila, curla and diple make a distinctive regional sound. It is partially diatonic in nature following the unique Istrian scale.

===Events===

The Slavonian town Požega hosts a known folk music festival, Zlatne žice Slavonije (&quot;Golden strings of Slavonia&quot;), which has prompted musicians to compose new songs with far-reaching influences, recently including American bluegrass.

The towns of Vinkovci and Đakovo, also in Slavonia, host yearly folklore festivals (&quot;Vinkovačke jeseni&quot; and &quot;Đakovački vezovi&quot;) where folk music is also listened to as part of the tradition.

The town of Slavonski Brod holds an annual festival called Brodfest, where many of the great tamburica bands come together to play.

The Dubrovnik Summer Festival puts on dramatic music and ballet. It was founded in 1950.

The Osor Musical Evenings was founded in 1976 and takes place in July and August. It plays classical Croatian masters.

The Musical Evenings in Donat takes place during the summer in Zadar. It was founded in 1961, and plays old music.

==Popular music==
===Pop===
The pop music of Croatia generally resembles the &quot;canzone&quot; music of Italy, while including elements of the native traditional music. Croatian record companies produce much material each year, if only to populate the numerous music festivals. Of special note is the Split Festival which usually produces the most popular summer hits.

Seasoned pop singers in Croatia include: Meri Cetinić, Mišo Kovač, Ivo Robić, Vice Vukov, Krunoslav Slabinac, Zlatko Pejaković, Arsen Dedić, Vinko Coce, Zdenka Vučković, Darko Domjan, Tereza Kesovija, Gabi Novak, Ivica Šerfezi, Oliver Dragojević, Tomislav Ivčić, Doris Dragović, Radojka Šverko, Maja Blagdan, Jacques Houdek and many others. Also, the groups Magazin, Novi fosili and Grupa 777 have had sustained careers.

In more recent times, younger performers such as Nina Badrić, Severina, Gibonni, Toni Cetinski, Jelena Rozga, Danijela, Lidija Bačić, Antonija Šola, Lana Jurčević and many others have captured the attention of the pop audience. Each of them have successfully blended various influences into their distinct music style. For example, Thompson&#x27;s songs include traditional epic themes from the Dinaric regions; Severina threads between Croatian pop and a folk sound.

Croatian pop music is fairly often listened to in Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia due to the union of Yugoslavia that existed until the 1990s. Conversely, Bosnian singers like Dino Merlin and Serbian Đorđe Balašević have an audience in Croatia, as well as some others. More recently the Turbo folk – frowned upon by the establishment some music critics and social commentators – has been popular amongst some sections of Croatian youth. A general resentment to Turbo folk remains as it is not broadcast on state radio and TV. Where on private outlets it may be transmitted, it normally triggers a strong negative reaction from those not liking it. Croatian singers that are using elements of Turbo folk are Severina and Jelena Rozga.

Croatia is a regular contestant on the Eurovision Song Contest. Back in Yugoslavia, Croatian pop group Riva won the contest in 1989. Since independence, Croatia&#x27;s best finish was in 2024 with the song &quot;Rim Tim Tagi Dim&quot; by Baby Lasagna, finishing second and the song later going on to chart across Europe. Some of the other Croatians who performed on the ESC include Danijel Popović, Put, Boris Novković and Claudia Beni.

===Rock===
The most popular rock bands active during the former Yugoslavia included Haustor, Psihomodo Pop, Azra, Prljavo Kazalište and Parni Valjak.

There are several rather popular and long-lasting mainstream rock acts like Parni Valjak, Prljavo Kazalište, Crvena Jabuka, Atomsko Sklonište, Aerodrom, Tutti Frutti Band, Daleka Obala, Đavoli, Stijene, More, Osmi putnik, Metak, etc. They originated in the 1970s and 1980s, and for the better part of their career resorted to a more mellow, mainstream pop-rock sound. Of some note is also the Sarajevo school of pop rock which influenced many of these bands, and which also included singers like Željko Bebek who later worked in Croatia.

However, Croatian new wave (&quot;Novi val&quot;) movement, which exploded in 1979/80 and lasted throughout the 1980s, is considered by many to be the high-water mark of Croatian rock music, both in terms of quality and commercial success. The most influential and popular bands of &quot;Novi val&quot; were Azra, Haustor, Film, even early Prljavo Kazalište. Other notable acts were Animatori, Buldožer, Paraf, Patrola etc.

In the late 1980s, the region of Istria became home to a kind of called Ča-val, which often used the Čakavian dialect and elements of traditional music from the regions of Istria and Kvarner.

The new wave scene has collapsed by the end of the eighties, to be replaced by the newcomers like; Tutti Frutti band, Daleka Obala, Majke and Laufer. While Daleka Obala sported a pop-rock sound influenced by Novi val, Croatian pop and even Dalmatian folk, Majke were a back-to-basics, garage-rock act stylistically influenced by bands like the Black Crowes, Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, as well as their Serbian counterparts Partibrejkers. Laufer, led by Damir Urban (who later went on to form Urban &amp; 4), were an early nineties alternative rock band taking their cue from the grunge movement.

Let 3 and KUD Idijoti are also prominent rock acts, popular both for their music and their interesting, often controversial, performances and stunts.

Beginning in the late 1980s, folk-rock groups also sprouted across Croatia. The first is said to be Vještice, who combined Međimurje folk music with rock and set the stage for artists like Legen, Lidija Bajuk and Dunja Knebl. At the same time on the other side of Croatia, in Istria, a band called Gustafi started playing their own strange amalgamate of rock and Istrian folk, but it took them more than a decade to reach the nationwide audience.

The Split metal band Osmi Putnik has also been a success in Croatia and still are today and are also popular in other ex-Yugoslav republics

The Sisak surf rock band The Bambi Molesters has in the past years gained sizeable international fame and are often touted as one of the best surf-rock acts in the world today.

Alternative rock/metal band Father have had success with their first album inspirita in countries like the UK, and have toured with bands like Korn, Anthrax and Apocalyptica.

There is also a number of Croatian bands who play modern music in English, most prominent being My Buddy Moose, The orange strips, In-the-go, Kimiko, Cold Snap and Snovi

===Dance===

Dance music in Croatia was an offspring of the local pop music and more Western influences. It developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s, picking up on the trends such as euro disco and eurodance. It also spawned a wave of electronic music artists, mostly house, techno and trance.

Dino Dvornik is one of the pioneers of electronic music in Croatian.

The singer Vanna rose to prominence through the dance trio &quot;E.T.&quot;, and the music of Vesna Pisarović has a fair bit of dance beat.

Although E.T. still operates, they&#x27;ve changed singers several times and lost in popularity. The band Colonia is perhaps the only one that rode the dance wave of the &#x27;90s and today is one of the most popular performers in Croatia.

===Rap===

The 1990s were marked by the emergence of Croatian rap music. The Ugly Leaders released the first ever Croatian Hip-Hop album, and gained a strong following in and around Rijeka. In 1991, the Croatian Liberation Front released two widely popular protest singles. The first rap band to gain widespread and lasting acclaim was The Beat Fleet (TBF) from Split, whose members took inspiration from harsh economic and social conditions of war-torn Dalmatia, not that different from American inner cities. Their act was followed by a multitude of artists and groups in Zagreb, taking inspiration from American gangsta rap. The Zagreb rappers Bolesna Braća (also called &quot;Sick Rhyme Sayazz&quot;) and Tram 11 became particularly popular, and to an extent also the duo Nered &amp; Stoka.

The Croatian rap gained much from the fact Edo Maajka, a Bosnian rapper, signed on to a label in Zagreb. Recently a rapper known as Shorty gained much popularity by having songs with a strong regional flavour of his native Vinkovci. The Zagreb band Elemental also entered the scene featuring one of the few Croatian female rappers.

===Other===

The tendency to combine different elements also has a long presence in more classical music: the opera Ero s onoga svijeta, written by Jakov Gotovac in the 1930s, blended the traditional music of the Dinaric peoples into a scholarly form and achieved great success.

==Classical==

Classical musicians and compositions by Croatian composers are generally not well known worldwide despite having produced a huge and interesting contribution over many centuries. Influences of style were often taken from neighbouring influences (Italy, Austria) or settlers (in the Mediterranean Croatia from Italy, and in Panonia (north Croatia) from Germany and Bohemia).

Croatian composers by current relevance in a global framework: (Maybe the order will change in the future, given that 95% of the composition exists as a single copy – the original manuscript, and yet need to be saved from oblivion, and then be performed and recorded on CD, and then presented to the international public)

* Vatroslav Lisinski (born as Ignaz Fuchs) considered as the founder of the Croatian nationalist music composed the first Croatian national opera &quot;Ljubav i Zloba&quot; (&quot;Love and Malice&quot;) and national opera &quot;Porin&quot;. Was a composer of great potential, but lived in a wrong time in a wrong place, and was a victim of politically based intrigues.
* Ivan Zajc (born as Giovanni von Zaytz) composed a series of operas in Italian, German and Croatian language. The music bears the features of authentic Italian melodics, since he grew up in a Croatian-Italian town Fiume (present-day Rijeka). His many instrumental compositions are unknown to the public, and yet need to be explored by musicologists and then published.
* Josip Hatze is the author of the first Croatian mass (ca. 1895) and the first Croatian cantata (&quot;Night on Una&quot;, 1902).
* Dora Pejačević (born as Theodora Pejacsevich) – one of the composers to introduce the orchestral song to Croatian music. Her Symphony in F-sharp minor is considered by scholars to be the first modern symphony in Croatian Music. 
* Blagoje Bersa (born as Benito Bersa) is a typical figure of late Romantic stylistic crisis, the author of &#x27;futuristic&#x27; opera Der Eisenhammer / Oganj (Zagreb, 1911).
* Fran Lhotka (alternative spelling: Franz Lhotka) – ballet The Devil in the Village; Violin Concerto; 
* Rudolf Matz (alternative spelling: Rudolph Matz) – School for the Violoncello; Concerto for Flute and Strings; Concertino in Modo Antico for Violoncello and Strings; 
* Božidar Kunc – Piano Concerto; piano sonatas; songs for voice and piano; 
* Franjo Dugan – works for organ; Violin Sonata; 
* dr. Božidar Širola – wrote numerous high-quality compositions, some of which were performed just once and then fell into oblivion, probably because of political reasons. The majority – if not all of them – were never given a modern-day performance 
* Boris Papandopulo
* Stjepan Šulek – the symphonies; Sonata for Trombone and Piano &#x27;Vox Gabrieli&#x27;; 
* Josip Štolcer Slavenski Sonata for Violin and Piano; Slavonic Dances for Piano; 
* Drago Kocakov – composed the only Croatian sonata for a classy ensemble made up of two violins – the violin duo 
* Julije Bajamonti 
* Julije Skjavetić 
* Ivan Lukačić 
* Luka Sorkočević

Modern composers: 
* Ivo Josipović 
* Milko Kelemen 
* Pavel Dešpalj 
* Ivo Malec 
* Stanko Horvat 
* Marko Ruždjak 
* Dubravko Detoni 
* Igor Kuljerić
* Darko Hajsek

Croatian society of composers (Hrvatsko drustvo skladatelja – HDS) is the main organization promoting modern classical music in Croatia.

== Jazz ==

Jazz appeared in Croatia in the 1920s, and flourished in Zagreb by the late 2000s, making it a regional center for jazz. In 1947, the jazz orchestra of Radio Zagreb was founded, which lives on today as the &quot;HRT Big Band.&quot; In 1959, vibraphone player Boško Petrović, who was likely the most famous Croatian jazz musician, founded the &quot;Zagreb Jazz Quartet&quot;. Today, there is a fair number of active jazz groups in Croatia, and various cities host jazz festivals. Jazz has left its mark on the Croatian pop scene throughout the years, most notably in the works of Drago Diklić and occasionally Josipa Lisac.

== Christian music ==
Croatian Catholic priests of Dalmatia, Istria and Kotor sang in Church Slavonic language during the 9th and 10th centuries, from which formed different forms of individual or choral spiritual music. The first inscription about that kind of singing dates from 1177, when it was sung laudibus and canticis &quot;in eorum sclavica lingua&quot; to Pope Alexander II during his visit in Zadar.

Very famous is repertory of church verses &quot;Cithara octochorda&quot;, which was published three times (Vienna: 1701, 1723 and Zagreb: 1757). It contains Christian music inheritance of Croats, both Kajkavian and Latin verses. Those verses set to music and adapted to organs famous Croatian church music composers Albe Vidaković, Anđelko Klobučar and others. That arrangement is part of Catholic liturgy in Croatia today. Croatian church composers (Peran, Vidaković, Klobučar) composed so-called &quot;Croatian Masses&quot;, which also become regular part of liturgy.

EffaTha is the first Croatian Christian metal band. Christian pop is very popular among Croatian Catholic youth, especially bands such as Emmanuel, Božja pobjeda (&quot;God&#x27;s Victory&quot;) and Srce Isusovo (&quot;Heart of Jesus&quot;).

The most famous contemporary Christian music singers and composers are Dragutin Hrastović, Čedo Antolić, Alen Hržica, Nika Vlahović, Husar and Palić sisters. Some pop singers like Nina Badrić and Tajči were also affiliated with Christian music, as much as Meri Cetinić who composed spiritual songs.

<doc id="243020" wikidata="Q1370756" url="?curid=243020" title="Louis A. Johnson">
<text>Louis Arthur Johnson (January 10, 1891April 24, 1966) was an American politician and attorney who served as the second United States secretary of defense from 1949 to 1950. He was the assistant secretary of war from 1937 to 1940 and the 15th national commander of the American Legion from 1932 to 1933.

== Early life ==
Johnson was born on January 10, 1891, in Roanoke, Virginia, to Marcellus and Catherine (née Arthur) Johnson. He earned a law degree from the University of Virginia. After graduation, he practiced law in Clarksburg, West Virginia; his firm, Steptoe &amp; Johnson eventually opened offices in Charleston, West Virginia, and Washington, DC Elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1916, he served as majority floor leader and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. During World War I, Johnson saw action as an Army captain in France, where he compiled a long report to the War Department on Army management and materiel requisition practices. After the war, he resumed his law practice, was active in veterans&#x27; affairs, and served as National Commander of the American Legion.

== Assistant Secretary of War, 1937–40 ==
As Assistant Secretary of War from 1937 to 1940, Johnson advocated universal military education and training, rearmament, and expansion of military aviation. He feuded with the isolationist Secretary of War Harry Hines Woodring over military aid to Britain. In mid-1940, after Woodring had resigned and the fall of France had revealed the precarious state of the nation&#x27;s defenses, Franklin D. Roosevelt bypassed Johnson for the position of Secretary of War but instead choosing Henry Stimson.

Having aspired to the position of Secretary, which he felt he had earned, Johnson felt betrayed by Roosevelt. During the war, Johnson had no major responsibilities within the government involving military matters, but he agreed to participate in the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s war mobilization of US industry. Later, he served as Alien Property custodian for the American operations of the German chemical giant I. G. Farben. In 1942, Johnson briefly served as the president&#x27;s personal representative in India, until an intestinal illness caused him to resign his post and return to the United States.

== Secretary of Defense ==

In the 1948 presidential campaign, Johnson was chief fundraiser for President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s election campaign; the money raised by Johnson proved crucial to Truman&#x27;s come-from-behind victory in the November elections. As a regular visitor to the White House, Johnson not only continued to express an interest in defense matters, but actively campaigned for the post of secretary of defense. He was also a staunch supporter of Truman&#x27;s desire to &#x27;hold the line&#x27; on defense spending. After a series of conflicts with Defense Secretary James V. Forrestal over defense budget cutbacks, Truman asked for Forrestal&#x27;s resignation, replacing him with Johnson early in 1949.

=== Defense budget reductions ===
Secretary Johnson entered office sharing the president&#x27;s commitment to achieve further military unification and to drastically reduce budget expenditures on defense in favor of other government programs. As one of Truman&#x27;s staunchest political supporters, Johnson was viewed by Truman as the ideal candidate to push Truman&#x27;s defense budget economization policy in the face of continued resistance by the Department of Defense and the armed forces.

According to historian Walter LaFeber, Truman was known to approach defense budgetary requests in the abstract, without regard to defense response requirements in the event of conflicts with potential enemies. Truman would begin by subtracting from total receipts the amount needed for domestic needs and recurrent operating costs, with any surplus going to the defense budget for that year. From the beginning, Johnson and Truman assumed that the United States&#x27; monopoly on the atomic bomb was adequate protection against any and all external threats. Johnson&#x27;s unwillingness to budget conventional readiness needs for the Army, Navy or Marine Corps soon caused fierce controversies within the upper ranks of the armed forces. From fiscal year 1948 onwards, the defense department budget was capped at the amount set in FY 1947 ($14.4 billion), and was progressively reduced in succeeding fiscal years until January 1950, when it was reduced yet again to $13.5 billion. 
Johnson was also an advocate of defense unification, which he saw as a means to further reduce defense spending requirements. At a press conference the day after he took office, Johnson promised a drastic cut in the number of National Military Establishment boards, committees, and commissions, and added, &quot;To the limit the present law allows, I promise you there will be unification as rapidly as the efficiency of the service permits it.&quot; Later, in one of his frequent speeches on unification, Johnson stated that &quot;this nation can no longer tolerate the autonomous conduct of any single service ... a waste of the resources of America in spendthrift defense is an invitation to disaster for America.&quot;

To ensure congressional approval of proposed DOD budget requests, both Truman and Johnson demanded public acquiescence, if not outright support, from the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and other military department commanders when making public statements or testifying before Congress. In 1948, JCS Chief of Staff General Omar Bradley stated that &quot;the Army of 1948 could not fight its way out of a paper bag.&quot; Yet the following year, after becoming Chairman of the JCS under Johnson, Bradley reversed course and publicly supported Johnson&#x27;s decisions, telling Congress that he would be doing a &quot;disservice to the nation&quot; if he asked for a larger military force. General J. Lawton Collins went even further when testifying before a House Appropriations committee, stating that Truman administration reductions in Army force levels made it &quot;more&quot; effective. 
Johnson promptly began proposing mothballing or scrapping much of the Navy&#x27;s conventional surface fleet and amphibious forces. Shortly after his appointment, Johnson had a conversation with Admiral Richard L. Conolly that revealed his attitudes towards the US Navy and US Marine Corps and any need for non-nuclear forces:

Admiral, the Navy is on its way out. There&#x27;s no reason for having a Navy and a Marine Corps. General Bradley tells me amphibious operations are a thing of the past. We&#x27;ll never have any more amphibious operations. That does away with the Marine Corps. And the Air Force can do anything the Navy can do, so that does away with the Navy.

Both Truman and Johnson extended their opposition to the Navy in their treatment of the US Marine Corps. Truman had a well-known dislike of the Marines from his Army service in World War I and would say in August 1950, &quot;The Marine Corps is the Navy&#x27;s police force and as long as I am President that is what it will remain. They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin&#x27;s.&quot; Johnson exploited this ill feeling of Truman&#x27;s to reduce or eliminate many Marine Corps&#x27; budget requests. Johnson attempted to eliminate Marine Corps aviation by transferring its air assets to other services and proposed to progressively eliminate the Marine Corps altogether in a series of budget cutbacks and decommissioning of forces. Johnson ordered that the highest-ranking Marine officer, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, be deleted from the official roll of chiefs of service branches authorized a driver and limousine, and for whom a special gun salute was prescribed on ceremonial occasions. He further specified that there would be no future official recognition or celebration of the Marine Corps birthday. More ominously, Johnson barred the Commandant of the Marine Corps from attending JCS meetings in his role of chief of service (including meetings involving Marine readiness or deployments).
Johnson welcomed the passage of the 1949 amendments to the National Security Act of 1947, telling an American Legion convention that he was &quot;happy to report ... that 80 percent of the problems that beset unification immediately disappeared when the President signed the bill increasing the authority and the responsibility of the Secretary of Defense.&quot; Believing that the amendments would help him achieve additional budget cuts, Johnson estimated that one year after their passage the Defense Department would be achieving savings at the rate of $1 billion per year (he later claimed that he had attained this goal). One of his slogans was that the taxpayer was going to get &quot;a dollar&#x27;s worth of defense for every dollar spent&quot; by the Pentagon, an approach that Truman approved.

Johnson did not limit his budget-cutting campaign to the Navy or Marine Corps. Johnson ordered nearly all of the Army inventories of surplus World War II tanks, communications equipment, personnel carriers and small arms be scrapped or sold off to other countries instead of being shipped to ordnance and storage depots for reconditioning and storage. Johnson even resisted budget requests for reserve stockpiles of small arms and anti-tank ammunition, anti-tank weapons, or amphibious infantry training for the Army&#x27;s newly acquired ex-Navy landing craft, which promptly began to deteriorate from lack of proper maintenance. Though the United States Air Force (USAF) faced fewer program cancellations and cuts, Johnson refused USAF requests for a doubling of active air groups until the invasion of Korea and favored reduction of tactical air force readiness in favor of the strategic nuclear bomber forces.

=== Revolt of the Admirals ===

Johnson&#x27;s defense cuts, which began on April 23, 1949, were accelerated after he announced the cancellation of the 65,000-ton flushdeck aircraft carrier . The Navy had been planning the ship for several years and construction had already begun. Johnson, supported by a slim majority of the JCS and by Truman, stressed the need to cut costs. At least by implication, Johnson had scuttled the Navy&#x27;s hope to participate in strategic nuclear air operations through use of the carrier. Neither the Department of the Navy nor Congress had been consulted in the termination of &quot;United States&quot;. Abruptly resigning, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan expressed concern about the future of the US Marine Corps and both Marine and Navy aviation and Johnson&#x27;s determination to eliminate those services through progressive program cuts.

Faced with such large-scale budgetary reductions, competition between the service branches for remaining defense funds grew increasingly acrimonious. The cancelation of the supercarrier precipitated a bitter controversy between the Navy and the USAF, the so-called &quot;Revolt of the Admirals.&quot; In congressional hearings and other public arenas, the Navy reacted angrily to Johnson&#x27;s action by openly questioning the ability of the Air Force&#x27;s latest strategic bomber, the Convair B-36, to penetrate Soviet airspace. The USAF countered with data supporting the B-36 and minimized the importance of a naval role for surface ships in future major conflicts.

Subsequently, declassified material proved the USAF to be technically correct in its immediate assessment of the capabilities of the B-36 at the time of the Revolt of the Admirals. At the time, it was indeed virtually invulnerable to interception due to the great height at which it flew. However, the B-36 was a pre-World War II design and by the time it was actually operational and fully deployed to Air Force active duty bombardment wings and bombardment squadrons, the B-36 was hopelessly vulnerable to modern Soviet MiG-15 jet interceptors, aircraft that would greatly surprise US officials when they later appeared over North Korea. Once engaged in the conflict in Korea that would evolve into the Korean War, the role of USAF heavy bombers evolved into an extension of their role during World War II, support of in-theater tactical ground forces. The USAF heavy bomber aircraft employed was the B-29 Superfortress of the Second World War, and the B-36 would see no combat in Korea.

In the long run, Navy arguments for the supercarrier prevailed, though not for the reasons originally cited. A relative failure as a strategic nuclear deterrent, the large aircraft carrier would prove invaluable as an element of conventional rapid deployment tactical air forces, requiring neither overflight permissions or overseas basing rights with host nations. The successors to the canceled supercarrier, the new s, and later designs, continue in service with the US Navy into the 21st century, forming the core of its offensive striking power.

However, a more ominous (if less publicized) development than the supercarrier debate was Johnson&#x27;s steady reduction of force in Navy ships, landing craft, and equipment needed for conventional force readiness. Ship after ship was mothballed from the fleet for lack of operating funds. The US Navy and Marine Corps, which had been the world&#x27;s preeminent amphibious force just a few years earlier, lost most of its amphibious capabilities and landing craft which were scrapped or sold as surplus (the remaining craft were reserved solely for Army use in amphibious operations exercises, which did not utilize them in that role). To cheaply rectify the issue, Johnson oversaw the unpopular seizure of the ocean liner SS &quot;United States&quot; to convert her to a troop transport. The move further alienated naval-related elements of the US Government, including the shipyard, naval designers, Maritime Commission, and the press. This was the second time Johnson intervened with the shipyard, as the cancelation of the aircraft carrier &quot;United States&quot; allowed the ocean liner of the same name to begin construction in the same drydock.

=== House investigation ===
In June 1949, the House Committee on Armed Services launched an investigation into charges, emanating unofficially from Navy sources, of malfeasance in office against Johnson and Secretary of the Air Force W. Stuart Symington. The hearings also looked into the capability of the B-36, the cancellation of the supercarrier &quot;United States&quot; and JCS procedures on weapons development, and ultimately examined the whole course of unification. In addition to disparaging the B-36, Navy representatives questioned the current US military plan for immediate use of atomic weapons against large urban areas when a war started. The Navy argued that such an approach would not harm military targets, and that tactical air power, ground troops and sea power were the elements necessary to defend the United States and Europe against attack. The USAF countered that atomic weapons and long-range strategic bombers would deter war, but that if war nevertheless broke out, an immediate atomic offensive against the enemy would contribute to the success of surface actions and reduce US casualties. Strategic bombing, the USAF contended, provided the major counterbalance to the Soviet Union&#x27;s vastly superior ground forces.

In its final report, the House Armed Services Committee found no substance to the charges relating to Johnson&#x27;s and Symington&#x27;s roles in aircraft procurement. It held that evaluation of the B-36&#x27;s worth was the responsibility of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group and that the services jointly should not pass judgment on weapons proposed by one service. On the cancelation of the supercarrier, the committee questioned the qualifications of the Army and Air Force chiefs of staff, who had testified in support of Johnson&#x27;s decision, to determine vessels appropriate for the Navy. The committee, disapproving of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;summary manner&quot; of terminating the carrier and failure to consult congressional committees before acting, stated that &quot;national defense is not strictly an executive department undertaking; it involves not only the Congress but the American people as a whole speaking through their Congress. The committee can in no way condone this manner of deciding public questions.&quot;

The committee expressed solid support for effective unification, but stated that &quot;there is such a thing as seeking too much unification too fast&quot; and observed that &quot;there has been a Navy reluctance in the interservice marriage, an over-ardent Army, a somewhat exuberant Air Force... It may well be stated that the committee finds no unification Puritans in the Pentagon.&quot;

Finally, the committee condemned the dismissal of Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, the Chief of Naval Operations, who accepted cancellation of the supercarrier but testified critically on defense planning and administration of unification. Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews fired Denfeld on October 27, 1949, explaining that he and Denfeld disagreed widely on strategic policy and unification. The House Armed Services Committee concluded that Denfeld&#x27;s removal by Matthews was a reprisal because of Denfield&#x27;s testimony and a challenge to effective representative government. Matthews&#x27;s perceived vindictiveness towards much of the Navy&#x27;s uniformed senior leadership during his tenure led to a perception by both the public and the Congress of the Navy&#x27;s civilian leadership woes, a perception that also did not go totally unnoticed by the news media of the period. As &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; reported at the time, &quot;Secretary of the Navy Matthews does not have the confidence of the Navy and can not win it... Moreover, Mr. Matthews has forfeited the confidence of Congress by firing Admiral Denfeld.&quot; Matthews resigned as Secretary of the Navy in July 1951 to become Ambassador to Ireland.

Although Johnson emerged from the Revolt of the Admirals with his reputation intact, the controversy weakened his position with the services and probably with the President. Notwithstanding Johnson&#x27;s emphasis on unification, it was debatable how far it had really progressed, given the bitter recriminations exchanged by the Air Force and the Navy during the controversy, which went far beyond the initial question of the supercarrier to more fundamental issues of strategic doctrine, service roles and missions, and the authority of the secretary of defense. Moreover, Johnson&#x27;s ill-conceived budget cutbacks on force readiness would soon bear bitter fruit with the coming of the Korean War. Most historians attribute Johnson&#x27;s efforts to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, US naval aviation in both the Navy and Marine Corps as one of the important factors in bringing about the invasion of South Korea, supported by both China and the Soviet Union. After the initial onslaught on to the Korean peninsula by North Korean forces, no air bases on the Korean peninsula were available for the USAF to fight back from. As a result, all air support during those disastrous months came from , the only aircraft carrier left in the Western Pacific when South Korea was invaded. &quot;Valley Forge&quot; was soon joined by the other two aircraft carriers remaining in the Pacific.

=== Cold War ===
Momentous international events that demanded difficult national security decisions also marked Johnson&#x27;s term. The Berlin Crisis ended in May 1949, when the Soviets lifted the blockade. Johnson pointed to the Berlin Airlift as a technological triumph important to the future of air cargo transportation and as an example of the fruits of unification. A week after Johnson took office, the United States and 11 other nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty, creating a regional organization that became the heart of a comprehensive collective security system. After initial reservations, Johnson supported the new alliance and the program of military assistance for NATO and other US allies, which was instituted by the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949).

=== NSC 68 ===
In August 1949, earlier than US intelligence analysts had expected, the Soviet Union tested its first atomic device. That event and the almost-concurrent retreat of the Kuomintang regime from Mainland China hastened debate within the administration as to whether the United States should develop a hydrogen bomb. Initially, Johnson suspected, despite confirming air sample, that the Soviets had not really tested an atomic device at all. He theorized that perhaps an accidental laboratory explosion had occurred and that no reassessments of US defense capabilities were needed.

Concluding that the hydrogen bomb was now required as deterrent as well as an offensive weapon, on January 31, 1950, Truman decided to proceed with development, which was supported by Johnson. Meanwhile, Truman directed the Secretaries of State and Defense to review and to reassess US national security policy in the light of the Soviet atomic explosion, the Chinese Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, and the acquisition of the hydrogen bomb and to produce a paper based on their new analysis. Johnson went about that task reluctantly, as he had promised Truman that he would hold the line on increased defense spending. Johnson was also upset that the State Department had first taken the lead on the policy assessment and had heavily influenced the contents of the resultant report NSC 68.

Truman was less than enthusiastic about the large defense cost projections for NSC 68 and its implications for existing domestic budgetary spending priorities, and initially sent it back without comment to its authors for further analysis. Although Truman took no immediate formal action on NSC 68, the paper gained considerable support when North Korea invaded South Korea. Johnson&#x27;s obstinate attitude toward the State Department&#x27;s role in the preparation of the paper adversely affected his relations with both Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Truman. Johnson publicly professed belief that &quot;the advance guard in the campaign for peace that America wages today must be the State Department,&quot; but his disagreements with Acheson and his restrictions on Defense Department contacts with the State Department persisted until the realities of the Korean War caused his fall from favor with the White House.

=== Failure in Korea ===
By 1950, Johnson had established a policy of faithfully following Truman&#x27;s defense economization policy and had aggressively attempted to implement it even in the face of steadily increasing external threats posed by the Soviet Union and its allied Communist regimes. He consequently received much of the blame for the initial setbacks in Korea and the widespread reports of ill-equipped and inadequately trained US military forces. Johnson&#x27;s failure to plan adequately for US conventional force commitments, to train and equip current forces adequately, or even to budget funds for storage of surplus Army and Navy war materiel for future use in the event of conflict would prove fateful after the Korean War had started.

Ironically, only the US Marine Corps, whose commanders had stored and maintained their World War II surplus inventories of equipment and weapons, proved ready for deployment though they still were woefully under-strength and in need of suitable landing craft to practice amphibious operations (Johnson had transferred most of the remaining craft from the Navy and reserved them for use in training Army units). As US and South Korean forces lacked sufficient armor and artillery to repel the North Korean forces, Army and Marine Corps ground troops were instead committed to a series of costly rearguard actions as the enemy steadily progressed down the Korean Peninsula and eventually encircled Busan.

The impact of the Korean War on Johnson&#x27;s defense planning was glaringly evident in the Defense Department&#x27;s original and supplemental budgetary requests for fiscal year 1951 in which Johnson had at first supported Truman&#x27;s recommendation of a $13.3 billion defense budget. However, a month after the Korean War had started, the secretary hastily proposed a supplemental appropriation request of $10.5 billion (an increase of 79%), which brought the total requested to $23.8 billion. In making the additional request, Johnson informed a House appropriations subcommittee that &quot;in light of the actual fighting that is now in progress, we have reached the point where the military considerations clearly outweigh the fiscal considerations.&quot;

The US reverses in Korea and the continued priority accorded to European security resulted in rapid, substantive changes in US defense policies, including a long-term expansion of the armed forces and increased emphasis on military assistance to US allies. In addition, Truman recoiled from Johnson&#x27;s &quot;inordinate egotistical desire to run the whole government.&quot; Truman later noted how Johnson had &quot;offended every member of the cabinet... He never missed an opportunity to say mean things about my personal staff.&quot; Finally, concerned about public criticism of his handling of the Korean War, Truman decided to ask for Johnson&#x27;s resignation. On September 19, 1950, Johnson resigned as Secretary of Defense, and Truman quickly replaced him with General of the Army George C. Marshall.

== Later years ==
His political career at an end, Johnson returned to his law practice, which he pursued until his death from a stroke in 1966 in Washington, DC, at the age of 75. He is buried at the Elkview Masonic Cemetery in Clarksburg, West Virginia. He was survived by his wife, Ruth Frances Maxwell Johnson and daughters Lillian and Katherine.

In his last speech as Secretary of Defense, the day before he left office, Johnson made a reference to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;: &quot;When the hurly burly&#x27;s done and the battle is won, I trust the historian will find my record of performance creditable, my services honest and faithful commensurate with the trust that was placed in me and in the best interests of peace and our national defense.&quot;

On December 7, 1950, The Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center was dedicated in honor of Johnson. The medical center rests on a 16-acre site adjacent to the Veterans Memorial Park and the West Virginia State Nursing Home in the city of Clarksburg, West Virginia. This medical center has been an active teaching facility since 1960 by participating in residency and academic affiliations with West Virginia University, Fairmont State University, Alderson-Broaddus College, and other nearby institutions of higher education.

<doc id="243022" wikidata="Q3328583" url="?curid=243022" title="Music of Algeria">
<text>Algerian music is virtually synonymous with Raï among foreigners; the musical genre has achieved great popularity in France, Spain and other parts of Europe. For several centuries, Algerian music was dominated by styles inherited from Al-Andalus, eventually forming a unique North African twist on these poetic forms. Algerian music came to include suites called nuubaat (singular &quot;nuuba&quot;). Later derivatives include rabaab and hawzii.

==Genres==

Music in Algeria offers a rich diversity of genre: popular music (Chaabi), various genres of Andalusian classical music such as Sana&#x27;a, Gharnati music, Ma&#x27;luf, as well as classical Arabic, Bedouin, Berber music (Staifi, Raï, Kabyle, Shawi, Tuareg, Gnawa, etc.),

Andalusian music is particularly well developed in Algeria, and is considered the most sophisticated by musical scholars - there exist three schools, the greatest number in the Maghreb region, and the performers invited to festivals across the Maghreb are usually of Algerian origin. 
Famous performers include Beihdja Rahal, Brahim Hadj Kacem, Nouri Koufi and Leila Borsali. 

Haouzi music is another style of Algerian music. It took the melodies of Andalusian music and modernized them. Haouzi music is most often played at weddings and ceremonies. 

Khaled known as Cheb Khaled, is considered as the King of Rai music, has achieved international fame, 
as Rai music is very popular in Algeria, Morocco France, Tunisia, Turkey, Libya, and 
Egypt.
Staifi is a genre of music which began in Eu-eulma City, and is mostly played at weddings and celebrations, primarily featuring lyrics which symbolize purity and love.

Chaabi refers to a style of recent urban popular music, inherited from the older Andalusian repertoire, of which the best known performer was El Hajj Muhammad El Anka, considered to be the Grand Master of Andalusian classical music. True styles of folk music include hofii, a form of female vocal music, and zindalii, from Constantine.

Raï is a creative outlet to express love and romance; a mix between Western music and Bedouin music.

Ma&#x27;luf is a genre of Andalusian classical music from Constantine which has survived because of the efforts of the Tunisian government and a few private individuals. Malouf is still performed in public, especially at weddings and circumcision ceremonies, though recordings are relatively rare.

<doc id="243023" wikidata="Q676755" url="?curid=243023" title="London Palladium">
<text>The London Palladium () is a Grade II* West End theatre located on Argyll Street, London, in Soho. The theatre was designed by Frank Matcham and opened in 1910. The auditorium holds 2,286 people. Hundreds of stars have played there, many with televised performances. Between 1955 and 1969 &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; was staged at the venue, produced for the ITV network. The show included a performance by the Beatles on 13 October 1963; one newspaper&#x27;s headlines in the following days coined the term &quot;Beatlemania&quot; to describe the hysterical interest in the band.

While the theatre hosts resident shows, it is also able to host one-off performances, such as concerts, TV specials and Christmas pantomimes. It has hosted the Royal Variety Performance 43 times, most recently in 2019.

==Architecture==
Walter Gibbons, an early moving-pictures manager, intended for the Palladium, in 1910, to compete with Sir Edward Moss&#x27;s London Hippodrome and Sir Oswald Stoll&#x27;s London Coliseum. The facade (on the site of Argyll House, demolished in the 1860s, from which the pub opposite took the name &quot;The Argyll Arms&quot;), dates back to the 19th century. Formerly it was a temporary wooden building called &quot;Corinthian Bazaar&quot;, which featured an aviary and aimed to attract customers from the recently closed Pantheon Bazaar (now the site of Marks &amp; Spencers) in Oxford Street. The theatre was rebuilt a year later by Fredrick Hengler, the son of a tightrope walker, as a circus arena for entertainments that included promenade concerts, pantomimes and an aquatic display in a flooded ring. It then became the &quot;National Skating Palace&quot; – a skating rink with real ice. However, the rink failed and the Palladium was redesigned by Frank Matcham, a famous theatrical architect who also designed the Coliseum, on the site that had previously housed Hengler&#x27;s Circus.

The theatre retains many of its original features and was Grade II* listed in September 1960. The building now carries Heritage Foundation commemorative plaques honouring Lew Grade and Frankie Vaughan.

The Palladium had its own telephone system so the occupants of boxes could call one another. It also had a revolving stage.

==History==
===1910 to 1928===
The theatre started out as &quot;The Palladium&quot;, a premier venue for variety performances. Pantomimes were also featured there. In 1926, the pantomime starred Lennie Dean as Cinderella, of which footage has survived. The theatre is especially linked to the Royal Variety Performances, where many were, and still are, held. In 1928, for three months the Palladium also ran as a cinema. Following this &#x27;cine-variety&#x27; episode the theatre fell dark for a short period in the autumn of 1928.

===The George Black era===
From 3 September 1928, the Palladium reopened under the directorship of the impresario/producer George Black as part of the General Theatre Corporation (GTC). When Black took control the theatre was close to bankruptcy. He revived its fortunes by returning to the original ethos of the Palladium by staging large variety shows, with a capital &#x27;V&#x27; – and as well as headlining Britain&#x27;s homegrown acts he brought over big American stars such as Duke Ellington and his Orchestra (on 12 June 1933, his first ever concert hall performance), Adelaide Hall, Louis Armstrong and Ethel Waters for two-week engagements. Before too long, under Black&#x27;s management the Palladium was soon gaining praise again as &#x27;The World&#x27;s Leading Variety Theatre&#x27;. In 1935, Black initiated the Crazy Gang revues at the Palladium (for which he is chiefly remembered) with &quot;Life Begins at Oxford Circus&quot;. The revues continued at the Palladium as an annual event until they transferred to the Victoria Palace theatre in 1940. Black managed the Palladium until his death in 1945.

The climax of the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock spy thriller &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; was filmed at the Palladium.

====Second World War====
The theatre was hit by an unexploded German parachute mine on 11 May 1941. The device had fallen through the roof, becoming lodged over the stage. A Royal Navy bomb disposal team was sent to deal with it. After the mine was located, the fuse locking ring had to be turned to allow access to the fuse itself. Rather disconcertingly, the fuse began ticking as soon as it was touched. This caused a rapid evacuation of the immediate area, but the mine did not detonate. The two team members cautiously returned, extracted the fuse and removed other hazardous components, rendering the mine &#x27;safe&#x27;. It was then lowered to the stage and disposed of. The George Medal for gallantry and undaunted devotion to duty was given to Sub Lieutenant Graham Maurice Wright for his action in the Palladium on that night. He was later killed, on 19 August 1941, while en route for Gibraltar on board the torpedoed troopship SS Aguila.

===The Val Parnell era===
Val Parnell took over as managing director after George Black&#x27;s death in 1945. He adopted a controversial, but very successful, policy of presenting high-priced, big-name American acts at the top of the bill. Among many, the list included Carmen Miranda, Judy Garland, Sophie Tucker, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Channing Pollock, the Andrews Sisters with Vic Schoen and his orchestra, Bob Hope, Liza Minnelli, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, freezing out many British stars of the day, who were relegated to second-billing.

From 1955 to 1967, the theatre was the setting for the top-rated ITV Network variety show &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; hosted first by Tommy Trinder, followed by Bruce Forsyth, Norman Vaughan, and Jimmy Tarbuck. The programme was broadcast live every week by ATV, which was owned by the famous theatrical impresario Lew Grade. Production was by Val Parnell. Six programmes aired as special episodes in the United States between May and August 1966 on NBC. British stars on the show included Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Petula Clark, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles&#x27; publicist, Tony Barrow, said that after the band&#x27;s first appearance on the show on 13 October 1963, Beatlemania took off in the UK. Their performance was watched by 15 million viewers. One national paper&#x27;s headlines in the following days coined the term &quot;Beatlemania&quot; to describe the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical interest in the Beatles – and it stuck.

Parnell became associated with a property development company and began to sell Moss Empires&#x27; theatres for redevelopment. When it became known in 1966 that this fate awaited the London Palladium, The Victoria Palace and even the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, Prince Littler organised a take-over to save the theatres and Val Parnell retired to live in France. The new managing director of Stoll-Moss was Louis Benjamin, who took on the role while continuing as MD of Pye Records within the ATV Group.

By 1965, the Wine Society was operating out of a cellar under the Palladium. Additionally, it was also using one at Joiner Street under London Bridge Station and one at St James&#x27;s Bond in Rotherhithe (which flooded at high tide). In 1968, Sammy Davis Jr. starred in &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, the first book musical to be produced in the venue. A Johnny Cash album was recorded there in 1968, but Columbia Records never released it. Bootlegs of the performance are in circulation. Jose Feliciano also recorded a hit USA gold status double LP for RCA records called &quot;Alive Alive O!&quot; in April 1969

===Post-Parnell===
 On 6 December 1970 Dorothy Squires gave a concert at the Palladium, recorded for an LP release the following year.

In January 1973, glam rock band Slade played a gig in the theatre which resulted in the venue&#x27;s balcony nearly collapsing. 

In July 1974, singer Cass Elliott performed for two weeks. 48 hours after her final performance she died in her sleep in her rented flat in Mayfair. Also in 1974, Josephine Baker performed in the Royal Variety Performance. The 1991 film &quot;The Josephine Baker Story&quot; implied that, like Cass Elliott, she died after a show there, but this is not true. She actually died in Paris four days after a show there.

Bing Crosby performed for two weeks at the Palladium starting on 21 June 1976. The resulting live album Bing Crosby Live at the London Palladium reached No. 9 in the UK album charts in November 1977.&lt;br&gt;

In October 1976, Marvin Gaye recorded a live concert at the venue. The performance documented on the resulting double LP, entitled &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot; and released in 1977. 

In 1981, the cellars of the Palladium housed a waxworks museum, aptly called &quot;The Palladium Cellars&quot;, headlined by a Yul Bryner live projection automaton, as the cowboy Gunslinger from &quot;Westworld&quot;.

In the late 1980s, the Palladium was once again the setting for the popular ITV variety show, &quot;Live From the Palladium&quot;, compered by Jimmy Tarbuck. During this time, the theatre was under the ownership of the Stoll Moss Theatres Group, and the management of Margaret and David Locke, who were both major shareholders of Stoll Moss at the time.

In 1988, the Edinburgh Gang Show appeared as part of the British Musical Hall Society&#x27;s Silver Jubilee.

In 1991, a new production of the Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; opened starring Jason Donovan in the title role with Linzi Hateley as the Narrator. Phillip Schofield later replaced Donovan in the title role.

In 1994, Cameron Mackintosh produced a new revival of Lionel Bart&#x27;s musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;, directed by Sam Mendes. It starred Jonathan Pryce as Fagin and Sally Dexter as Nancy.

In 1998, Arlene Phillips directed and choreographed a stage musical adaptation of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; starring Adam Garcia and Ben Richards.

===The 21st Century &amp; the Really Useful Group ===

In 2000, ownership of the theatre changed once again when Stoll Moss was acquired by Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group. From 3 May 2000 to 5 January 2002, the Palladium played &quot;The King and I&quot; starring Elaine Paige and Jason Scott Lee. This production was a West End transfer of the hugely successful 1996 Broadway production. Before the opening, the box office had already taken in excess of £7 million in ticket sales. This version of the show was a lavish affair, with new dialogue and music added, while the original material was updated. During the run, Josie Lawrence played the role of Anna and Paul Nakauchi and Keo Woolford played the role of the King, respectively. After the production closed, the famous (but outdated) revolving stage was removed to make way for more modern technology.

From April 2002 to 4 September 2005, the Palladium hosted a theatrical version of &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; with songscore by the Sherman Brothers as a successor to &quot;The King &amp; I,&quot; directed by Adrian Noble and choreographed by Gillian Lynne. The original cast included Michael Ball, Emma Williams, Anton Rodgers, Nichola McAuliffe, Brian Blessed and Richard O&#x27;Brien. Throughout its three-and-a-half-year run at the venue, the production starred many celebrities. This show proved to be the most successful in the theatre&#x27;s long history and reunited, 50 years later, the show&#x27;s choreographer Gillian Lynne, with the theatre in which she had appeared as the Palladium&#x27;s Star Dancer during the early 50s. 

On 1 November 2004 and 22 November singer-songwriter Jackson Browne performed two concerts during his solo acoustic tour. For Christmas 2005–06, the venue staged Bill Kenwright&#x27;s production of &quot;Scrooge – The Musical&quot; which closed on 14 January 2006. The show starred Tommy Steele, making a return to the Palladium. From February 2006, the theatre played host to a new musical production entitled &quot;Sinatra At The London Palladium&quot;, which featured a live band, large screen projections and dancers performing Frank Sinatra&#x27;s greatest hits.

Lloyd Webber and David Ian&#x27;s production of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; opened at the Palladium in November 2006. The production ran for just over two years, before closing on 21 February 2009. It starred Connie Fisher and Summer Strallen as Maria, Simon Shepherd, Alexander Hanson and Simon MacCorkindale as Captain Von Trapp and Lesley Garrett and Margaret Preece as the Mother Abbess. A production of &quot;Sister Act the Musical&quot; opened on 2 June 2009, starring Patina Miller as Deloris, Sheila Hancock as Mother Superior, Ian Lavender as Monsignor Howard, Chris Jarman as Shank, Ako Mitchell as Eddie, Katie Rowley Jones as Sister Mary Robert, Claire Greenway as Sister Mary Patrick and Julia Sutton as Sister Mary Lazarus.

Rufus Wainwright held two sold out Judy Garland tribute concerts at the theatre on 18 and 25 February 2007. On 20 May 2007 the London Palladium hosted the 2007 BAFTA awards, which were broadcast on BBC television, and in 2010 the BAFTA Television Awards returned to the Palladium. While the Theatre has a resident show, it is still able to have one-off performances; this is enabled by the scenery of the resident show being designed to be easily removed. For example, the set of &quot;Sister Act&quot; was able to be hoisted completely above the stage out of view in an area called the Fly Loft.

The London Palladium turned 100 years old on Boxing Day 2010, and a one-hour television special entitled &#x27;100 Years of the Palladium&#x27; aired on BBC Two on 31 December 2010. Sir Elton John performed at the venue in September 2013 in a special show where he was presented with the Brit Awards Icon, subsequently broadcast on ITV1. Robbie Williams promoted his new album &quot;Swings Both Ways&quot;, the UK&#x27;s 1000th No. 1 album, with a one-night performance on 8 November 2013 that was filmed for television broadcast (BBC One). He was joined by members of the cast of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Statler and Waldorf), Lily Allen, Rufus Wainwright, his father, a children&#x27;s choir and a 30-piece orchestra. Invited guests included Adele and One Direction.

From 2011 to 2012, the Palladium became home to Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s new production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; which featured new songs by Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice and starred Michael Crawford, Danielle Hope, Hannah Waddingham, Russell Grant, Sophie Evans and Des O&#x27;Connor. This was followed by a return season of &quot;&quot; starring Tommy Steele. In 2013 it became home to a revival of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; starring John Partridge, Scarlett Strallen and Leigh Zimmerman. 
Since 2013, excluding 2014, 2015 and 2016, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; have held Judges&#x27; auditions at the Palladium as one part of their audition tour which usually lasts from mid-January to late-February.

In 2014, Really Useful Group split in two, and the entity owning the theatre became the Really Useful Theatres Group. A revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Cats&quot; played for a season in late 2014 starring Nicole Scherzinger as Grizabella (later Kerry Ellis). It returned for another season in late 2015 starring Beverley Knight.

In December 2016, the annual Christmas pantomime returned for the first time in 29 years with &quot;Cinderella&quot;, produced and directed by Michael Harrison for Crossroads Pantomimes (previously Qdos Entertainment). The pantomimes have returned every year since welcoming star casting including Julian Clary, Nigel Havers, Gary Wilmot, Paul Zerdin, Paul O&#x27;Grady, Dawn French, Ashley Banjo and Diversity, Elaine Paige, Charlie Stemp, Amanda Holden, Lee Mead, Count Arthur Strong, Emma Williams, Danielle Hope, Flavia Cacace and Vincent Simone, Matt Baker, Sophie Isaacs, Janine Duvitski, Beverley Knight, Donny Osmond, The Tiller Girls, Alexandra Burke, Rob Madge, Natalie McQueen, Jennifer Saunders and Frances Mayli McCann. The 2017 pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Family Show.

In 2017, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; with songs by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe ran for a summer season starring Rufus Hound, Simon Lipkin, Neil McDermott, Gary Wilmot and Denise Welch.

In 2018, on the first anniversary of his death, Sir Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s ashes were laid to rest under the Palladium&#x27;s stage, with a blue plaque commemorating him on a nearby wall, featuring the description &quot;Without question the UK&#x27;s greatest entertainer, he rests in peace within the sound of music, laughter and dancing… exactly where he would want to be.&quot;
 For the 2018 summer season Bartlett Sher&#x27;s Tony Award-winning revival of &quot;The King and I&quot; ran direct from Broadway starring Kelli O&#x27;Hara and Ken Watanabe reprising their roles as Anna and the King.
In summer 2019, the Palladium staged the 50th Anniversary production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s and Tim Rice’ &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. The production starred Sheridan Smith as the Narrator, Jason Donovan as the Pharaoh (having previously played the title role in the 1991 Palladium revival) and Jac Yarrow in the title role. The production was due to return in summer 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was postponed to summer 2021. Donovan and Yarrow reprised their roles with Alexandra Burke as the Narrator with Linzi Hateley playing the Narrator at certain performances (reprising her role from the 1991 Palladium revival).

In 2022, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; ran for a limited summer season following its UK and Ireland tour starring Courtney Stapleton, Martin Ball, Gavin Lee, and Sam Bailey.

In summer 2023, a new production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was revived at the Palladium for a limited season starring Gary Wilmot, Ashley Banjo, Jason Manford, Dianne Pilkington, and Christina Bianco.

In summer 2024, a revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; directed by Dominic Cooke, starring Imelda Staunton, Jenna Russell, Andy Nyman and Tyrone Huntley ran for a limited season. As well as this, in July 2024 a concert by StarKid Productions: &quot;It&#x27;s StarKid, Innit&quot; will be performed. Tickets for the concert sold out rapidly causing the concert to be the fastest-selling musical concert in the history of the venue.

The 2019 Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre production of &quot;Evita&quot; is scheduled to transfer to the Palladium for a limited season in the summer of 2025.

<text>A Moveable Feast is a memoir by Ernest Hemingway about his years as a struggling expatriate journalist and writer in Paris during the 1920s. It was published posthumously in 1964. The book chronicles Hemingway&#x27;s first marriage to Hadley Richardson and his relationships with other cultural figures of the Lost Generation in interwar France.

Hemingway&#x27;s memoir references many notable figures of the time including Sylvia Beach, Hilaire Belloc, Bror von Blixen-Finecke, Aleister Crowley, John Dos Passos, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Pascin, Ezra Pound, Evan Shipman, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Hermann von Wedderkop. The work mentions many bars, cafes, and hotels that still exist in Paris today.

Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s suicide in July 1961 delayed the publication of the book, but the memoir was published posthumously in 1964 by his fourth wife and widow, Mary Hemingway, from the original manuscripts and notes. Another edition, with revisions by his grandson Seán Hemingway, was published in 2009.

==Background==
In November 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks containing his notebooks from the 1920s that he had stored in the basement of the Hôtel Ritz Paris in March 1928. Hemingway&#x27;s friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who was with him in Paris in 1956, recalled the event:

In 1956, Ernest and I were having lunch at the Hôtel Ritz Paris with Charles Ritz, the hotel’s chairman, when Charley asked if Ernest was aware that a trunk of his was in the basement storage room, left there in 1930. Ernest did not remember storing the trunk but he did recall that in the 1920s Louis Vuitton had made a special trunk for him. Ernest had wondered what had become of it. Charley had the trunk brought up to his office, and after lunch Ernest opened it. It was filled with a ragtag collection of clothes, menus, receipts, memos, hunting and fishing paraphernalia, skiing equipment, racing forms, correspondence and, on the bottom, something that elicited a joyful reaction from Ernest: &#x27;The notebooks! So that’s where they were! Enfin!&#x27; There were two stacks of lined notebooks like the ones used by schoolchildren in Paris when he lived there in the ’20s. Ernest had filled them with his careful handwriting while sitting in his favorite café, nursing a café crème. The notebooks described the places, the people, the events of his penurious life.

Hemingway had the notebooks transcribed and began to turn them into the memoir that would eventually become &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;. After Hemingway&#x27;s death in 1961, his widow Mary Hemingway made final copy-edits to the manuscript before its publication in 1964. In a &quot;note&quot; in the 1964 edition of the work, she wrote:

Ernest started writing this book in Cuba in the autumn of 1957, worked on it in Ketchum, Idaho, in the winter of 1958-59, took it with him to Spain ... in April, 1959, and brought it back with him to Cuba and then to Ketchum late that fall. He finished the book in the spring of 1960 in Cuba... He made some revisions ... in the fall of 1960 in Ketchum. It concerns the years 1921 to 1926 in Paris. - M.H.
Researchers, including literary scholar Gerry Brenner from the University of Montana, examined Hemingway&#x27;s notes and initial drafts of &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; in the collection the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts. In a 1982 paper titled &quot;Are We Going to Hemingway&#x27;s Feast?&quot;, Brenner documented Mary Hemingway&#x27;s editing process and questioned its validity. He concluded that some of her changes were misguided and that others had questionable motives. Brenner suggested that the changes contradicted Mary&#x27;s &quot;hands off&quot; policy as executor. Brenner stated that Mary had changed the order of the chapters in Hemingway&#x27;s final draft to &quot;preserve chronology&quot; and disrupted the juxtaposition of character sketches of individuals like Sylvia Beach, owner of the bookstore Shakespeare and Company, and Gertrude Stein. Mary reinserted a chapter titled &quot;Birth of a New School&quot;, which Hemingway had dropped from his draft. Brenner&#x27;s most serious change was that the 1964 book deleted Hemingway&#x27;s lengthy apology to Hadley, his first wife, which had appeared in various forms in every draft of the book. Brenner suggested that Mary deleted it because it impugned her role as wife.

Biographer Hotchner said that he had received a near final draft of &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; in 1959, and that the version Mary Hemingway published was essentially the draft he had read then. In Hotchner&#x27;s view, the original 1964 publication was the version that Hemingway intended and Mary Hemingway carried out Ernest&#x27;s intentions. Hotchner described Hemingway&#x27;s memoir as &quot;a serious work&quot;, which Hemingway &quot;certainly intended it for publication&quot;, and contended: &quot;Because Mary was busy with matters relating to Ernest’s estate, she had little involvement with the book... What I read on the plane coming back from Cuba [in 1959] was essentially what was published. There was no extra chapter created by Mary.

==Title==

The title, &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; (a play on words for the term used for a holy day for which the date is not fixed), was suggested by Hemingway&#x27;s friend and biographer A. E. Hotchner, who remembered Hemingway using the term in 1950. Hotchner&#x27;s recollection of Hemingway&#x27;s words became the source of the epigraph on the title page for the 1964 edition.

The phrase appears in a 1946 English translation of &quot;The Stranger&quot; by Albert Camus: &quot;Masson remarked that we’d had a very early lunch, but really lunch was a movable feast, you had it when you felt like it.&quot;

==Chapters==
The 1964 edition of Hemingway&#x27;s memoir consists of a preface by Hemingway (pg. ix), a &quot;note&quot; by his widow (pg. xi), and 20 independent chapters or sections. Each one can be read as a stand-alone piece or entity, not dependent upon the context of the whole work, nor necessarily arranged in any chronological order:

::* &quot;A Good Café on the Place St.-Michel&quot;
::* &quot;Miss Stein Instructs&quot;
::* &quot;Une Génération Perdue&quot;
::* &quot;Shakespeare and Company&quot;
::* &quot;People of the Seine&quot;
::* &quot;A False Spring&quot;
::* &quot;The End of an Avocation&quot;
::* &quot;Hunger Was Good Discipline&quot;
::* &quot;Ford Madox Ford and the Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;
::* &quot;Birth of a New School&quot;
::* &quot;With Pascin at the Dôme&quot;
::* &quot;Ezra Pound and His &quot;Bel Esprit&quot;&quot;
::* &quot;A Strange Enough Ending&quot;
::* &quot;The Man Who Was Marked for Death&quot;
::* &quot;Evan Shipman at the Lilas&quot;
::* &quot;An Agent of Evil&quot;
::* &quot;Scott Fitzgerald&quot;
::* &quot;Hawks Do Not Share&quot;
::* &quot;A Matter of Measurements&quot;
::* &quot;There Is Never Any End to Paris&quot;

==Publishing history==
The first edition was edited from Hemingway&#x27;s manuscripts and notes by Mary Hemingway, his fourth wife and widow, and published posthumously in 1964, three years after Hemingway&#x27;s death.

In 2009, another edition, titled the &quot;Restored Edition&quot;, was published by Hemingway&#x27;s grandson Seán Hemingway, curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Pauline Pfeiffer. The 2009 edition made numerous changes:
* The introductory letter by Hemingway, pieced together from various fragments by Mary Hemingway, was removed.
* The chapter called &quot;Birth of a New School&quot; and sections of &quot;Ezra Pound and the Measuring Worm&quot; and &quot;There Is Never Any End to Paris&quot; (which has been renamed as &quot;Winter in Schruns&quot; and moved to chapter 16) included earlier omissions. The unpublished &quot;The Pilot Fish and the Rich&quot; was added.
* Chapter 7 (&quot;Shakespeare and Company&quot;) became chapter 3; chapter 16 (&quot;Nada y Pues Nada&quot;) moved to the end of the book as an &quot;Additional Paris Sketch&quot;.
* Hemingway&#x27;s use of the second person was restored in many places, a change that Seán said &quot;brings the reader into the story&quot;.

From the new foreword by Patrick Hemingway:

&quot;[H]ere is the last bit of professional writing by my father, the true foreword to &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;: &#x27;This book contains material from the &quot;remises&quot; of my memory and of my heart. Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist&#x27;.&quot;

== Reception ==

=== Reactions to the 2009 edition ===
A.E. Hotchner alleged, among his other criticisms of the 2009 edition, that Seán Hemingway had edited it, in part, to exclude references to his grandmother (Hemingway&#x27;s second wife Pauline Pfeiffer) that he found less than flattering. On the 2009 edition, Hotchner said: &quot;Ernest was very protective of the words he wrote, words that gave the literary world a new style of writing. Surely he has the right to have these words protected against frivolous incursion, like this reworked volume that should be called “A Moveable Book”.

Other critics have found fault with some of Seán Hemingway&#x27;s editorial changes. Irene Gammel wrote about the new edition: &quot;Ethically and pragmatically, restoring an author&#x27;s original intent is a slippery slope when the published text has stood the test of time and when edits have been approved by authors or their legal representatives.&quot; Pointing to the complexity of authorship, she concluded that “Mary&#x27;s version should be considered the definitive one, while the &#x27;restored&#x27; version provides access to important unpublished contextual sources that illuminate the evolution of the 1964 edition.”

== Legacy ==

===Adaptations===
On September 15, 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Mariel Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway and his first wife, had acquired the film and television rights to the memoir with American film producer John Goldstone. In 2019, it was reported that a television series was being developed through Village Roadshow Entertainment Group, but there was no planned release date.

===Cultural references===

====In films====
* The comedy film &quot;The Moderns&quot; (1988) brings the characters of &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; to life while spoofing the pretense of the Lost Generation.
* The book is featured in the movie &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1998) during an exchange between Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.
* Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; is set in the Paris of the 1920s as portrayed in Hemingway&#x27;s book, and the movie features the Owen Wilson character interacting with Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and uses the phrase &quot;a moveable feast&quot; in two instances.
* &quot;The Words&quot; (2012) uses an excerpt from &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; to represent a book manuscript found in an old messenger bag.
* In the American movie &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014), one of the books on the shelf in the character Steve Rogers&#x27; apartment is Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.
* In the American film &quot;French Postcards&quot; (1979), a character quotes the epigraph from the book in order to convince a fellow American student who is studying in France with him to not only study, but enjoy life in Paris.
* In the American comedy film &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay&quot; (2008), a stripper named Tits Hemingway says she got the latter part of her name because her favorite novel is &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.

====In literature====
* The writer Enrique Vila-Matas named his book &quot;Never Any End to Paris&quot; (2003) after the final chapter of Hemingway&#x27;s work.

====In stage performances====
* In his stand-up performances in the late 1960s, Woody Allen performed a routine that referenced the recently published book and described imaginary times spent with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and Gertrude Stein with the recurring punch line: &quot;And Hemingway punched me in the mouth.&quot;

===Revival in France===
&quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; became a bestseller in France following the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. In the context of the attacks, the book&#x27;s French-language title, &quot;Paris est une fête&quot;, was seen as a symbol of defiance and celebration. Bookstore sales of the volume surged and copies of the book appeared in makeshift memorials across the city in honor of victims of the attacks.

=== Hemingway&#x27;s wine ===
In &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Hemingway described what life was like for aspiring writers in 1920s Paris. In addition to writing about his friendships, marriage, and writing routine in Parisian cafes, Hemingway also discussed his love of good wine, noting the different wines he and his friends enjoyed with their meals.

* Sancerre: &quot;A False Spring&quot;, &quot;Another day later that year when we had come back from one of our voyages and had good luck at some track again we stopped at Prunier&#x27;s on the way home, going in to sit at the bar after looking at the clearly priced wonders in the window. We had oysters and crab mexicane with glasses of Sancerre.&quot;
* Mâcon: &quot;Scott Fitzgerald&quot;, &quot;We had a marvellous lunch from the hotel at Lyon, an excellent truffled roast chicken, delicious bread and white Mâcon wine and Scott was very happy when we drank the white Maconnais at each of our stops. At Mâcon I had bought four more bottles of excellent wine which I uncorked as we needed them.&quot;
*Corsican: &quot;With Pascin at the Dôme&quot;, &quot;At home, over the sawmill, we had a Corsican wine that had a great authority and a low price. It was a very Corsican wine and you could dilute it by half with water and still receive its message.&quot;
* Cahors: &quot;With Pascin at the Dôme, &quot;&quot;At the Negre de Toulouse we drank the good Cahors wine from the quarter, the half or the full carafe, usually diluting it about one-third with water...In Paris, then, you could live very well on almost nothing and by skipping meals occasionally and never buying any new clothes, you could save and have luxuries.&quot;

In September 2020, Chiswick Book Festival featured a wine and literature event celebrating Hemingway&#x27;s wine in &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; presented by Victoria Daskal.

<doc id="243040" wikidata="Q6942029" url="?curid=243040" title="Music of California">
<text>In the United States, California is commonly associated with the film, music, and arts industries; there are numerous world-famous Californian musicians. New genres of music, such as surf rock and third wave ska, have their origins in California.

==Official state symbols==
The official state song of California is &quot;I Love You, California&quot;, written by F. B. Silverwood and composed by Alfred F. Frankenstein of the Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra. It was designated the state song in 1951. Other songs, including &quot;California, Here I Come&quot;, have also been candidates for additional state songs since 1951, but in 1988 the official standing of &quot;I Love You, California&quot; was confirmed.

California also has an official fife and drum band, the California Consolidated Drum Band, which was so designated in 1997.

The state&#x27;s official folk dance is the square dance, which has been found in California since at least the Gold Rush.

==Indigenous music==

Many groups of Indigenous peoples of California lived and continue to live within the current geographic boundaries of California, before and since colonization by Europe.

In the late 19th century, American Indian music began to be incorporated by classical composers throughout the country, known as the Indianist movement. In San Francisco, Carlos Troyer published compositions like Apache Chief Geronimo&#x27;s Own Medicine song, with a piano accompaniment by Troyer.

==Early foreign influences==
The earliest Spanish and English explorers in California encountered Native Americans and established missions to convert them to Christianity. Chanted prayers and hymns were often used, and choirs were eventually formed; many missions formed Native American choirs among recent converts.

As California&#x27;s European, Asian, and African population increased in the 19th century, the state became the earliest West Coast territory admitted to the United States. As on the East Coast, music at the time was dominated by popular minstrel shows and the sale of sheet music. Performers included the Sacramento-born Hyers Sisters and Black Patti.

Chinese immigrants came to California to work on the transcontinental railroad and soon became a large minority in the state; the San Francisco Chinese Opera House was built in 1880. However, two years later the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in order to prevent more immigration. The visit of King Kalakaua of Hawaii in 1874 saw the Hawaiian national anthem, &quot;Hawaii Ponoi&quot; (written by the king) set to music by Henri Berger. In the 1880s, Carlos Troyer became a prominent composer, incorporating Spanish and Zuni influences. Polish composer Anton de Kontski&#x27;s &quot;Polish Patrol&quot; and &quot;Awakening the Lion&quot; were also quite popular.

===Spanish and Mexican influence===

The state&#x27;s large Mexican population brought traditional folk guitar to California, including virtuoso Luis T. Romero. The Spanish missions in California brought European music to the area. From the late 18th century to the late 19th century, many visitors to California remarked on the uniqueness of the Spanish language music in California. This music was distinctively Californian, different from both Mexican and Spanish music of the time (though many elements are found throughout these traditions).

With the arrival of many Americans from the East Coast, as well as immigrants from as far away as China, however, Spanish folk music began to dwindle in popularity in California. Charles Fletcher Lummis, himself an immigrant to California, recorded many kinds of Spanish and Native American folk music for the Southwest Society of the Archaeological Institute of America. Later in the 20th century, other revivalists like Gabriel Eulogius Ruiz and Al Pill helped keep Spanish-California traditions alive.

==Mexican and Latin American music in California today==
Because of its historical and cultural connections to Mexico and strong Hispanic influences, California hosts numerous Spanish language radio stations, variety music shows and local based Mariachi and Mexican folk music bands. Popular music such as Ranchera, Norteño, son music can be heard on many radio stations across the state from the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento to the southern end of the Central Valley and down to San Diego.

Southern California has been home to Spanish language singers and musicians for over 100 years. La Pena Cultural Center in Berkeley has worked promote Salsa and traditional Latin American music to encourage a strong cultural connection between Californians and Latin Americans.

Mexican American musical artists from California vary widely in musical genre, from traditional Mexican music to Alternative Metal; among the most celebrated are Zack de la Rocha (of Rage Against the Machine), Chris Montez, Chino Moreno (of the Deftones), Ozomatli, Jenni Rivera, Los Tigres del Norte, Robert Trujillo (of Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, and Infectious Grooves), La Santa Cecilia, Carlos Santana, and Ritchie Valens.

==1930s and 1940s==
Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnographer from San Francisco, collected a trove of American folk songs for the WPA Northern California Folk Music Project (1938–1940), which she initiated.

===West Coast blues===
===Western swing===
==1950s and 1960s==

===Bakersfield sound===

In the 1950s and early 1960s, country music was dominated by the slick Nashville sound that stripped the genre of its gritty roots. The town of Bakersfield saw the rise of the Bakersfield sound as a reaction against Nashville, led by people such as Buck Owens and future star Merle Haggard.

===Folk===

California was an important part of the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and early 1960s, led by the San Francisco Bay Area group the Kingston Trio. Their first hit, the 1958 single &quot;Tom Dooley&quot; (a Billboard #1 Hot 100 hit), sold more than 3 million copies and inspired the addition of a &quot;folk&quot; category to the Grammy awards the following year. The Trio&#x27;s success inspired many pop-folk groups (recognizable by the performance of traditional or traditional-sounding music and use of acoustic rather than electric guitars), including California-based The Limeliters. California venues like the Hungry i promoted the genre and several major albums were recorded there. Folk music faded in popularity after the mid-1960s British Invasion, but merged with the British sound to create folk rock, pioneered by the Los Angeles band the Byrds.

===R&amp;B===
R&amp;B group the Robins formed in San Francisco and helped establish the doo-wop sound. Members of the Robins went on to form the Coasters in Los Angeles, alongside the Platters, the Penguins, the Flairs, the Cadets, the Hollywood Flames, and the Blossoms. Johnny Otis was born in Vallejo. Etta James was born in Los Angeles.

===Chicano rock===

Chicano artists Ritchie Valens, the Champs, Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters, thee Midniters, the Premiers, the Blendells, and El Chicano emerged from southern California in this period.

===Pop===
Vocal group the Lennon Sisters formed in Venice.

The Walker Brothers, formed in Los Angeles in 1964, achieved success in the United Kingdom during the British Invasion.

===Surf rock, sunshine pop, and the California Sound===

In the early 1960s, youth in southern California became enamored with surf rock groups, many instrumental, like the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, the Chantays, Royale Monarchs, the Honeys, the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and the Surfaris. Surf rock is said to have been invented by Dick Dale with his 1961 (see 1961 in music) album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&#x27;&quot;. Surf rock&#x27;s popularity ended in the mid-1960s with the coming of psychedelic music, however bands like Papa Doo Run Run have continued to perform and tour for the last 40 years.

===Garage rock===

The Standells, the Seeds, the Leaves, and the Music Machine formed in the Los Angeles area. Count Five, Syndicate of Sound, and the Chocolate Watchband formed in San Jose.

===Psychedelic rock===

The late 1960s saw San Francisco rise as the center for psychedelic rock and a mecca for hippies. Haight-Ashbury became a countercultural capital, and bands like Jefferson Airplane, Loading Zone, Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Ace of Cups, Country Joe and the Fish, Santana, the Charlatans, Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company, and the Grateful Dead helped to launch the blues- and folk-rock scene; other bands, like Moby Grape and the Flamin&#x27; Groovies used a more country-influenced sound, while Cold Blood and Sons of Champlin incorporated R&amp;B and Orkustra played a sort of free-form psychedelia. Of all these bands, the Grateful Dead were undoubtedly the longest-lasting of all. They continued recording and performing for several decades under the leadership of Jerry Garcia, experimenting with a wide variety of folk, country, and bluegrass, and becoming a part of the jam band phenomenon.

Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Strip area produced bands like the Byrds, the Doors, Love, Buffalo Springfield, Strawberry Alarm Clock, and the Seeds. The Byrds went on to become a major folk-rock act, helping to popularize some of Bob Dylan&#x27;s compositions and eventually launching the careers of folk-rockers like David Crosby and country-rock fusionist Gram Parsons.

Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, both from Antelope Valley, started their aggressively experimental music careers during the late 1960s.

The band Iron Butterfly is another noted California psychedelic band, coming out of San Diego.

====San Francisco psychedelic scene====

This era began in about 1965, when The Matrix, the first folk club in San Francisco, opened; Jefferson Airplane, then a newly formed and unknown band, performed that night. Later that year, a band known as the Warlocks became the Grateful Dead, performing at The Fillmore, which was to become a major musical venue in the area. Jefferson Airplane became the first San Francisco psychedelic band signed to a major label, followed soon after by Sopwith Camel. In 1966, the first acid test was held, and the use of the drug LSD became a more prominent part of psychedelic rock, and music in general. One of the first albums from the scene was Country Joe and the Fish&#x27;s &quot;Electric Music for the Mind and Body&quot; (1967). A year later, the band Blue Cheer released &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot;, which launched a national hit with a cover of Eddie Cochran&#x27;s &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;; Blue Cheer is now regarded as a progenitor of heavy metal.

===Experimental===

The San Francisco Tape Music Center was founded in 1962 by composers Morton Subotnick, born in Los Angeles, and Ramon Sender. Under a commission, synthesizer pioneer Don Buchla, born in South Gate, created his first modular synthesizer in 1963 and started Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments.

The Mothers of Invention was formed in 1964 in Pomona, California, originally known as the Soul Giants, the band&#x27;s first lineup included Ray Collins, David Coronado, Ray Hunt, Roy Estrada, and Jimmy Carl Black. Frank Zappa was asked to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and Coronado, the band&#x27;s original saxophonist/leader. Zappa insisted that they perform his original material, and on Mother&#x27;s Day in 1965, changed their name to the Mothers. Record executives demanded that the name be changed, and so &quot;out of necessity,&quot; Zappa later said, &quot;we became the Mothers of Invention.&quot;

==1970s and 1980s==
The early part of this era was dominated by country rock acts such as the Eagles and Poco, and singer-songwriters such as Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell. There were also funk acts that were prominent such as War from the South Central (now South) district of Los Angeles, Sly and the Family Stone and Tower of Power from Oakland. Santana blended rock, jazz, funk, and Latin music. Latin R&amp;B band Tierra formed in Los Angeles in this period. This period also saw a number of difficult-to-classify acts arising who did not sell many records, but proved to be very influential on things to come, such as Kim Fowley, Captain Beefheart, Sparks, and Fanny, all from Los Angeles, who had been active in the 1960s but reached their artistic peaks during this era. Fowley would go on to manage and produce the all-female punk-metal group, the Runaways. The Los Angeles scene of this period also produced the Go-Go&#x27;s and the Motels. Boundary-stretching singer-songwriters such as Rickie Lee Jones and Warren Zevon (both originally from Chicago but whose careers developed in California) emerged to great critical acclaim.

The Tubes, who mixed progressive rock with wild theatricality, and Journey, formed from among some of Carlos Santana&#x27;s sidemen and eventually experiencing a peak as one of the most popular AOR acts in the United States, were virtually the only acts from San Francisco to gain any sort of fame in the mid-1970s. During the 1980s, Journey found further success, as did Huey Lewis and the News who combined elements of pub rock with doo-wop and soul, and Starship which formed from its earlier incarnation of Jefferson Starship.

Californians Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined Fleetwood Mac in the 1970s and were a key part of the band&#x27;s multi-platinum success.

===Punk rock in California===

====Los Angeles====
Los Angeles&#x27; original late 1970s punk scene received less press attention than their counterparts in New York or London, but it included cult bands the Screamers, the Germs, the Weirdos, the Dils, the Bags, 45 Grave (founded by Paul B. Cutler), Nervous Gender, and X.

Other Los Angeles-area punk and hardcore groups of the era include Wasted Youth, T.S.O.L., L7, Los Illegals, the Plugz, Cruzados, the Brat, the Controllers, the Hollywood Squares, Super Heroines, the Pandoras, the Droogs, Catholic Discipline, the Mau-Mau&#x27;s, VOM, Dr. Know (featuring former child star Brandon Cruz), Legal Weapon, Claw Hammer, the Mentors (originally from Seattle), along with future underground stars NOFX.

====South Bay====
In the Los Angeles South Bay, American hardcore punk was born with bands like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Minutemen and Youth Brigade, who formed in the mid-1970s to early 1980s. SST Records was started by Greg Ginn of Black Flag in Long Beach in 1978. San Pedro, Hermosa Beach, Wilmington, Manhattan Beach, and Hawthorne spawned more locally famous acts like Red Cross (who would later incorporate garage rock, power pop, and glam influences into their sound and change their name to Redd Kross), the Last, Circle Jerks, Saint Vitus, the Descendents, and Saccharine Trust. The famous movie about the hardcore scene, &quot;The Decline of Western Civilization&quot;, was shot in this area, largely in an abandoned church in Hermosa called the Creative Craft Center. The movement fell out of popularity around the mid-1980s. The late 1980s/early 1990s saw a revival in the South Bay punk scene with punk bands like Bad Religion, Down by Law, NOFX, the Offspring, Pennywise, and Ten Foot Pole under the Epitaph Records label.

====San Fernando Valley====
Youth Brigade founded BYO Records in 1982 in Sun Valley. Also of note is the band Bad Religion, who hailed from the western San Fernando Valley and were only marginally associated with hardcore punk rock from the South Bay area. The punk scene in the eastern San Fernando Valley was closely tied in with that of nearby Hollywood and produced bands such as the Dickies, Fear, and the Angry Samoans. The bands Iconoclast and Public Nuisance also hailed from this area. Numerous punks shows in the 1980s, including shows by Circle Jerks and Black Flag, took place in a warehouse on the old site of Devonshire Downs in Northridge.

====Orange County====

In Orange County, the band Middle Class, from Santa Ana, was probably the most influential; their &quot;Out of Vogue&quot; is sometimes considered the first hardcore recording. The original hardcore bands in Orange County came from the Fullerton area, where the Adolescents, Agent Orange, Social Distortion, and D.I. formed. Social Distortion would later incorporate blues, country, and early rock influences into their sound and become one of America&#x27;s premier roots rock bands. Farther south, Huntington Beach was also an influential center of hardcore, and is known as the origin of slam dancing, credited to Jimmy Trash the singer of The Crowd who created The Slam Dance at the Cuckoos Nest. Huntington band T.S.O.L. had a reputation for being aggressive and sometimes violent, while Uniform Choice became known as a prominent straight edge band from the West Coast, Love Canal from Huntington Beach was the complete opposite bringing a more humorous version of hardcore punk to the scene. Another Orange County band of note is the U.S. Bombs fronted by Duane Peters. True Sounds of Liberty (TSOL) was perhaps the most infamous for violence, and for an abrupt and unpopular change towards proto-Gothic rock and, much later, Aerosmith-style heavy metal as the scene developed; future underground stars the Vandals evolved from TSOL&#x27;s eventual breakdown. Other Orange County bands included Channel 3 (CH3), White Mice, the Offspring, Big Drill Car, Guttermouth, Suicidal Tendencies (who were from Venice but were associated with Orange County hardcore), China White and Shattered Faith.

The area had a big hand in the third wave ska scene with this region giving rise to Save Ferris, Reel Big Fish, and the scenes&#x27; most well-known act the Gwen Stefani-fronted No Doubt who would go on to pop super-stardom.

====San Diego====
The Zeros formed in Chula Vista in 1976. The Neutrons gained limited success, eventually changing their name to Battalion of Saints. The Donkey Show was a ska band that saw some notoriety during the late 1980s, helping to establish the genre known as third wave ska. The Dils were originally from Carlsbad, a San Diego suburb, later moving to San Francisco.

====San Francisco====
Outside of New York, London, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston, San Francisco probably had the earliest punk scene, at least as far back as 1976. The scene was aided by San Francisco&#x27;s famously laid back attitude towards alternative lifestyles, and the legendary record label Alternative Tentacles. Crime and the Nuns were first, followed by Chrome, the Mutants, the Units, the Contractions, Angst, the Sleepers, Pop-O-Pies, Frightwig, Crucifix, Negative Trend, the Avengers, Toiling Midgets, Flipper and Romeo Void. The most influential San Francisco hardcore band was Dead Kennedys, whose frontman, Jello Biafra, became a noted social activist. Many hardcore bands moved to San Francisco, including legends MDC, as well as D.R.I., Tales of Terror (from Sacramento, who made Kurt Cobain&#x27;s Top 50 list of favorite bands and essential listening), the Dicks, and Rhythm Pigs (all from Texas).

====Berkeley====
Berkeley experienced a hardcore boom led by Fang. Berkeley also saw hardcore fusing with heavy metal to form thrash metal and bands like Possessed, Faith No More, Metallica, and Exodus.

Also in the mid-late 1980s hardcore, pop punk, and ska punk bands gained a following with bands such as Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, The Mr. T Experience, the Lookouts, Isocracy, Green Day, Blatz, and Plaid Retina. These bands played at the infamous Gilman Street Project and released records on Lookout! Records.

====San Jose====
San Jose&#x27;s most famous hardcore band was the Faction, who played with local bands such as Los Olvidados. It is also from where some members of Rancid hailed. Punk rock band No Use for a Name is also from San Jose.
As the punk rock drought in San Jose left the area thirsty, 2005 spawned from its sewers the gutter punk outfit Medicated Motherfuckers. Quenching the thirst of those in the Bay Area with shameless intoxicated tales of debauchery.

===Heavy metal===

====Glam metal====
Glam metal arose along the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles in the 1980s with bands like Quiet Riot, Mötley Crüe, and later Pennsylvania immigrants Poison and quickly became known for anthemic hard rock and power ballads, as well as band members&#x27; distinctively feminine make-up, hair, and clothing in spite of the scene&#x27;s macho posturing. This scene would die out in the 1990s due to grunge.

====Thrash metal====

The Bay Area thrash scene was centered around Los Angeles and San Francisco in the 1980s and 1990s. Bands associated with this scene include Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Exodus, Vio-lence, Suicidal Tendencies, Dark Angel, Death Angel, D.R.I., Testament, Forbidden, Defiance, and Evildead.

===Alternative rock===
Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth grew up in Los Angeles, where she attended Otis Art Institute, before moving to New York.

Wall of Voodoo multiple-drum-machine and Farfisa organ laden recordings with wild guitars and clever and desert wise road lyrics out of central Hollywood Boulevard and Selma Avenue wild life started the New wave trend in Southern California late 1970s early 1980s.

The Cretones added power pop guitar riffs and thoughtful lyrics with a touch of humor and sarcasm in the late 1970s early 1980s. They attracted the attention of Linda Ronstadt, who recorded three of their songs on her new wave album &quot;Mad Love&quot;, titled after the Cretones&#x27; song.

At the same time that gothic rock began in the United Kingdom, a parallel death rock scene evolved in Los Angeles out of the punk scene, with bands like 45 Grave and Christian Death.

Inspired by bands like the Gun Club and Ohio transplants the Cramps, cowpunk bands such as Tex &amp; the Horseheads, and Blood on the Saddle arose from Los Angeles in the 1980s.

The Paisley Underground scene would arise out of Los Angeles in the mid-1980s around Redd Kross, The Three O&#x27;Clock (originally The Salvation Army), the Bangles, the Dream Syndicate, the Long Ryders, Rain Parade, Opal, Mazzy Star, and others.

Faith No More and Primus formed in San Francisco in the 80s. Los Angeles&#x27; Red Hot Chili Peppers steadily built up media attention with their first recordings in the mid-to-late-1980s, and went on to become one of the world&#x27;s premier rock bands in the following decade. Santa Cruz spawned Camper Van Beethoven in the mid-1980s. Jane&#x27;s Addiction would arise out of Venice in the late 1980s.

===Experimental===

The Los Angeles Free Music Society was formed in 1973 and produced the group Smegma.

The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo was an American surrealist street theatre troupe, formed by performer and director Richard Elfman in 1972. The group was led by Richard until 1976, when his brother Danny Elfman took over. The group evolved into an experimental musical theatre group, performing songs from the 1930s-40s and original material. In 1979, Danny Elfman wished to pursue a new direction as a dedicated rock band and the group reformed as Oingo Boingo. Several Mystic Knights band members continued with the new band including Steve Bartek, Leon Schneiderman, Dale Turner, and Sam &#x27;Sluggo&#x27; Phipps.

Mr. Bungle is an experimental band formed in Eureka, California, in 1985. Having gone through many incarnations throughout their career, the band is best known for music created during their most experimental era. During this time, they developed a highly eclectic style, cycling through several musical genres, often within the course of a single song, including heavy metal, avant-garde jazz, ska, disco, and funk, which is further enhanced by lead vocalist Mike Patton&#x27;s versatile singing style. This period also saw the band utilizing unconventional song structures and samples; playing a wide array of instruments; dressing up in masks, jumpsuits, and other costumes; and performing a diverse selection of cover songs during live performances.

===Hip hop===

During the 1980s, hip hop music flourished in Los Angeles and surrounding areas, especially Watts and Compton. Derived from New York City, hip hop drew upon primarily East Coast influences, though early 1970s black nationalist poets the Watts Prophets were also notable. The earliest forms of Los Angeles hip hop were hardcore hip hop artists like Ice-T (whose mid-80s &quot;6 in the Mornin&#x27;&quot; is arguably the first West Coast gangsta rap track). Among the most popular electro hop groups was the World Class Wrecking Cru, which included future star Dr. Dre, DJ Yela, and others and also featured singer Michel&#x27;le, an early pioneer in combining soulful R&amp;B singing with hip-hop beats. In 1988, Dr. Dre, along with Eazy-E and Ice Cube, released &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot; under the name N.W.A The album took many hip hop fans by surprise, as it single-handedly placed West Coast hip hop on the map and quickly moved gangsta rap into the mainstream. The main gangsta rap and west coast hip hop cities were Long Beach, San Francisco, Oakland, Vallejo, Pittsburg Sacramento, Richmond, East Palo Alto, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Fresno, Compton, and Inglewood.

==1990s and 2000s==

===Hip hop===
Called &quot;The Golden Age of Hip hop&quot;, the 1990s saw the rise of such legendary rappers as 2Pac, Cypress Hill, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Kid Frost, Snoop Dogg, Yo-Yo.

In the 1990s Ice Cube released six albums and the first five albums all went platinum, and the last one, &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot;, went gold. Cube became an icon for West Coast hip hop for his songs about social and political issues. In 1992, Dr. Dre&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;The Chronic&quot;, made West Coast hip hop and Death Row Records the dominant sound in hip hop, drawing primarily upon George Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk for samples and the general, slow, lazy funk, which G-funk music was founded in Los Angeles and Long Beach. Death Row Records soon acquired Tupac Shakur, Warren G and Snoop Doggy Dogg as a feud developed between the East and West Coasts. In the mid-90s, Shakur and his rival Notorious B.I.G. were both shot and killed. Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight was imprisoned, and most of the label&#x27;s acts tried to leave. The lack of leadership helped put New York, Atlanta, and New Orleans on the top of the hip hop charts, leaving local would-be legends and underground MC&#x27;s (emcees) to work under self-financed productions.

In the 1990s, underground hip hop flourished in the San Francisco Bay Area. Early pioneers included Too Short and E-40; their success helped pave the way for new performers like RBL Posse, whose 1992 &quot;Don&#x27;t Gimme No Bammer&quot; achieved some crossover success. The Bay Area&#x27;s thriving underground rap scene has produced literally hundreds of artists, some of the better known being Andre Nickatina, the Coup, Michael Franti, the Conscious Daughters, Paris, Blackalicious, Ya Boy, and San Quinn. The Bay Area is also home to the relatively new &quot;Hyphy&quot; subgenre. Mac Dre was one of the notable innovators. San Francisco was very impressive in hip hop, boasting west coast legends Rappin&#x27; 4-Tay, RBL Posse, Andre Nickatina, JT The Bigga Figga, Cougnut, and more. San Francisco and Oakland were some of the homes of the late global rapping legend Tupac Shakur. The inner-city of San Francisco&#x27;s neighborhoods&#x27; crime inspired the rap scene of San Francisco.

Madlib and brother Oh No were born in Oxnard. Dilated Peoples, Jurassic 5, and Flying Lotus are from Los Angeles. The Alchemist is from Beverly Hills.

===Indie rock===

The early 1990s saw the emergence of Pavement, an influential indie rock band from Stockton. In the mid-1990s, Beck came out of the Silver Lake (a neighborhood in Los Angeles) indie rock scene. Queercore bands Tribe 8, Pansy Division, Cypher in the Snow, the Little Deaths, and Sta-Prest formed in San Francisco in the 1990s and recorded for local label Outpunk among others. San Francisco also produced the Trashwomen and Fabulous Disaster. Los Angeles and southern California also produced Longstocking, Best Revenge, Red Aunts, Quetzal, the Muffs, and Emily&#x27;s Sassy Lime in the 1990s.

The 2000s brought the emergence of Ariel Pink, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Or, the Whale, the Aislers Set, the Botticellis, Scissors for Lefty, Deerhoof, Icebird, The Dodos, the Quails, the Curtains, I the Mighty, La Plebe, Erase Errata, the Phantom Limbs, the Donnas, Hunx and His Punx, Shannon and the Clams, Sic Alps, and the Union Trade from the San Francisco Bay Area and the Quarter After, Scarling., Best Coast, Warpaint, Autolux, Two Tears, Giant Drag, Brian Jonestown Massacre, HEALTH, Fool&#x27;s Gold, No Age, Foot Village, the Warlocks, Silver Daggers, Tearist, Mika Miko, and Ty Segall from Los Angeles. She Wants Revenge formed in the San Fernando Valley. Groups from San Diego include the Album Leaf, Three Mile Pilot, Pinback, Thingy, the Soft Pack, and the Black Heart Procession.

===Hardcore punk and metalcore===

The early-to-mid 1990s would see the birth of several bands in the San Diego, California music scene, some of which would lead a post-hardcore movement associated with the independent label Gravity Records. This movement would eventually become known as the &quot;San Diego sound&quot;. Gravity was founded in 1991 by Matt Anderson, member of the band Heroin, as a means to release the music of his band and of other related San Diego groups, which also included Antioch Arrow and Clikatat Ikatowi. The label&#x27;s earlier releases are known for the definition of &quot;a new sound in hardcore rooted in tradition but boasting a chaotic sound that showcased a new approach&quot; to the genre. Heroin were known for being innovators of early 1990s hardcore and for making dynamic landscapes &quot;out of one minute blasts of noisy vitriol&quot;. These bands were influenced by acts like Fugazi and The Nation of Ulysses, while also helping propagate an offshoot of hardcore that &quot;grafted spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics&quot;. This movement has been associated to the development of the subgenre of screamo, while it also should be noticed that this term has been, as with the case of emo, the subject of controversy. The label also featured releases by non-San Diego bands that included Mohinder (from Cupertino, California), Angel Hair and its subsequent related project The VSS (from Boulder, Colorado), groups that have also been associated with this sound. The VSS was known for their use of synthesizers &quot;vying with post-hardcore&#x27;s rabid atonality&quot;.

Outside the Gravity roster, another band that played an important role in the development of the &quot;San Diego sound&quot; was Drive Like Jehu. This group, founded by former members of Pitchfork, was known, according to Steve Huey, for their lengthy and multisectioned compositions based on the innovations brought by the releases on Dischord, incorporating elements such as &quot;odd time signatures played an important role on its development in spite of the band&#x27;s music not resembling the sound such term would later signify. In a similar manner, Swing Kids, composed of former members of hardcore bands from the San Diego scene such as Unbroken, Struggle and Spanakorzo, have been described by journalist Zach Baron as the moment in which the &quot;hardcore&quot; sound of bands like Unbroken effectively became &quot;post-hardcore&quot;, known for &quot;covering Joy Division songs&quot; and for its sonic &quot;jazz-quoting&quot; and &quot;guitar feedback&quot; experimentation features. They were also one of the first bands released under the independent label Three One G, founded by the band&#x27;s vocalist Justin Pearson and later known for releasing the works of several other post-hardcore, noise rock, mathcore and grindcore groups.

As metalcore became the popular subgenre of hardcore in the late 1990s to early 2000s, bands such as Avenged Sevenfold, As I Lay Dying, Atreyu, Confide, Dayseeker, Deadseraphim, Death By Stereo, Bleeding Through, Eighteen Visions, In Fear and Faith, In This Moment, Of Mice &amp; Men, Phinehas, Stick to Your Guns, and Throwdown made their mark in Southern California. A Skylit Drive and Jamie&#x27;s Elsewhere made their mark in Northern California.

Highly influential Post-hardcore luminaries, Drive Like Jehu (and the subsequent band, Hot Snakes) hail from San Diego. Rocket from the Crypt gained notoriety in the 1990s with vocalist and taste-maker John Reis&#x27; Swami Records and Swami Sound System radio show being very influential in the area. Hardcore bands Unbroken, Swing Kids, Some Girls, and Over My Dead Body also formed in San Diego during this period.

===Desert rock===

Desert Rock was formed by a group of closely related bands and musicians from Palm Desert in Southern California, including San Bernardino, Redlands, Palm Springs, and Indio. Their hard rock sound – which was often described as desert rock – contains elements of psychedelia, blues, heavy metal and other genres, such as hardcore, as well as distinctive repetitive drum beats; typically performed with electric guitar, bass guitar, and a drum kit. The musicians often play in multiple bands simultaneously, and there is a high rate of collaboration between bands. The Palm Desert Scene is also notable for producing stoner rock pioneers Kyuss. The term &quot;stoner rock&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;desert rock.&quot; However, not all Desert Rock bands are &quot;stoner rock.&quot; Notable Desert Rock style acts include Queens of the Stone Age, Kyuss, Sleep, Truckfighters, Eagles of Death Metal, Fatso Jetson, and Fu Manchu.

===Nu metal and alternative metal===

California was at the forefront for the emergence of these two genres in the 1990s with nu metal bands such as Korn, Linkin Park, Papa Roach and P.O.D all coming from California along with alternative metal bands such as A Perfect Circle, Audioslave, Deftones, Faith No More, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, and Tool.

The Monterey Pop Festival, held in 1967, is perhaps the most famous concert in California&#x27;s history; the show launched the international careers of performers like Jimi Hendrix, the Who, Otis Redding, and Janis Joplin.

Music organizations in the state include the Community Arts Music Association. There is also an organization that gives out California Music Awards.

<text>El Camino Real (The Royal Road) is the name (rough English translation: The King&#x27;s Highway) that the Spanish gave to a trail they cleared in the 1680s, mostly over the traditional trails of Native Americans, from St. Augustine westward to the Spanish missions in north Florida. Before this time, transpeninsular traffic in &quot;La Florida&quot; between the western mission settlements and the capital depended on water routes from Apalachee to St. Augustine. Agricultural commodities produced in Apalachee were carried by canoes to the Gulf of Mexico and southward on the coast to the mouth of the Suwanee River, then upriver to a location on the Santa Fe River. There they were loaded onto pack animals or the backs of Indian burderners (porters) for the remainder of the overland trip. Provisions and funds from the &quot;real situado&quot; were sent on the same route in reverse.
In 1673, the Franciscan Friar Juan Moreno suggested to the Queen Regent Mariana of Spain that the &quot;situado&quot;, or annual subsidy transferred from the royal treasury of New Spain, should be transported overland from Vera Cruz in Mexico to Apalachee, and from there to St. Augustine. His suggestion was disregarded, since the route he proposed went through the territories of unchristianized Indians who were not always on friendly terms with the Spanish, while the &quot;situado&quot;, in the form of silver coins, would have to be carried by burderners across the swamps, forests, and sizable bays and rivers of the Gulf of Mexico coast, which barred the passage of wagons or royal mule trains.

According to &quot;El Camino Real&quot;, published by the Florida Division of Historical Resources: &quot;In the 1680s, Florida Governor Diego de Quiroga y Losada contracted the services of military engineer Enrique Primo de Rivera to build a formal road across north Florida that was suitable for oxcarts. Although the project was never finished, people and goods continued to flow to and from the capital at St. Augustine, along the main corridor known as the Camino Real.&quot;

It could be said that the Spanish had an incomplete &quot;trail&quot; that very loosely connected the province of &quot;La Florida&quot; in the east to the Spanish settlements in &quot;Alta California&quot; in the west, through what historians call the Spanish borderlands, but it is a gross exaggeration to describe such a discontinuous pathway, the part on the Gulf of Mexico being merely Indian foot trails running along ridges, interrupted by large bodies of water and unbridged rivers with no ferries, as a &quot;highway&quot;.

The Spanish never built an actual road south of St. Augustine. Some unreliable sources claim that they built a road to New Smyrna in 1632, but the place did not exist in 1632. The area at the time was a wilderness uninhabited by Europeans, while the colony of New Smyrna begun and named by the Scottish Dr. Andrew Turnbull was not founded until 1768. The British built the King&#x27;s Road from Colerain, Georgia to New Smyrna, and the Spanish did use it when they reacquired Florida in 1783, but afterward they were rather lax in maintaining it.

<text>Jody David Scheckter (; born 29 January 1950) is a South African former racing driver and businessman, who competed in Formula One from to . Scheckter won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Ferrari, and remains the only African driver to have won either a Formula One Grand Prix or the World Drivers&#x27; Championship; he won 10 Grands Prix across nine seasons.

Born and raised in East London, Cape Province, Scheckter rapidly ascended through the ranks of motor racing upon moving to the United Kingdom in 1970. His Formula One debut came two years later at the 1972 United States Grand Prix, driving for McLaren, whom he had raced for that year in British and European Formula Two. Amongst winning the SCCA Continental Championship in Formula 5000, Scheckter entered a further five Grands Prix in with McLaren. Scheckter earned a full-time drive with Tyrrell the following season, taking his maiden win at the and finishing third in the championship. Scheckter won his home Grand Prix in South Africa in and placed third in the standings again in , driving the six-wheeled P34; he remains the only driver to win a Grand Prix on six wheels.

Moving to Wolf in , Scheckter took several race wins—including the —as he finished runner-up to Niki Lauda in the standings. After a winless season for Wolf in , Scheckter moved to Ferrari to partner Gilles Villeneuve. Winning three Grands Prix in his first season for Ferrari, Scheckter clinched the title with his victory at the , becoming the first World Drivers&#x27; Champion from Africa. He was unable to defend his title in as Ferrari struggled with the 312T5, retiring at the end of the season having achieved 10 race wins, three pole positions, five fastest laps and 33 podiums in Formula One.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Scheckter worked as a broadcaster for CBS, ABC and ITV. He founded a weapons simulation business in 1984 called &quot;Firearms Training Systems&quot;, whose revenue eclipsed £100 million by the early 1990s. Scheckter then moved into organic farming, owning Laverstoke Park Farm in England. His sons Toby and Tomas are both racing drivers.

==Career==

Jody David Scheckter was born on 29 January 1950 in East London, Cape Province, Union of South Africa, and educated at Vincent Primary School (East London) and Selborne College.

===Formula One===

He rapidly ascended to the ranks of Formula One after moving to Britain in 1970. His Formula 1 debut occurred at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen in 1972 with McLaren, where he ran as high as third place before spinning and finishing ninth. Immediately becoming a name to watch, he continued his development the following year, winning the 1973 SCCA L&amp;M Championship and racing five times in F1. In France, he almost won in only his third start in F1 before crashing into Emerson Fittipaldi, the reigning World Champion, who said after the crash about Scheckter: &quot;This madman is a menace to himself and everybody else and does not belong in Formula 1.&quot; In his next start, the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Scheckter&#x27;s spin triggered a major accident which took nearly a dozen cars out of the race. The Grand Prix Drivers Association demanded his immediate banishment, which was only put off when McLaren agreed to rest their driver for four races. Scheckter&#x27;s McLaren M23 bore the number zero during the Canadian and American Grands Prix of 1973. Scheckter is one of only two F1 drivers to compete under this number, the other being Damon Hill. During the practice for the American event at the Watkins Glen circuit, Frenchman François Cevert, who was due to be Scheckter&#x27;s Tyrrell teammate for 1974, was killed in an appalling accident at the fast uphill Esses corners. Scheckter was behind Cevert when he crashed, and he stopped his McLaren, got out of his car and attempted to help Cevert out of his destroyed Tyrrell, but the 29-year-old Frenchman had been cut in half by the circuit&#x27;s poorly installed Armco barriers and was already dead. Witnessing Cevert&#x27;s dreadful accident left an indelible mark on the South African and caused him to abandon his reckless ways, becoming a more mature and calculating driver as a result.
Tyrrell in 1974 gave Scheckter his first full-time drive in F1 and he rewarded them with a third-place finish in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and a pair of wins in Sweden and Britain. During the year, he scored points in eight consecutive races, one of the longer scoring streaks of the time. A slight off-year followed, although he did become the only South African to win the South African Grand Prix, but his third year with the team in 1976 gave him another third-place finish in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. In that season, Tyrrell introduced the most radical car in F1 history, the innovative six-wheeled Tyrrell P34. Although he later went on record as saying the car was &quot;a piece of junk&quot;, Scheckter gave the six-wheeler its only win on Sweden&#x27;s Anderstorp circuit and in his twelve races with the car, he scored points ten times. This included a thrilling race-long battle for the lead in the American Grand Prix between himself and his great friend James Hunt.
Scheckter left for Walter Wolf&#x27;s new team in 1977 and Scheckter gave the team a win in its maiden race. He won twice more with the team and was often on the podium, but finished second on points behind a more dominant Niki Lauda. A seventh-place finish with the team in 1978 followed and he left the team after the season to join Ferrari to partner Gilles Villeneuve in the team&#x27;s ground effect 312T4 car.Critics felt he would not get along well with the domineering management at Ferrari, but he far surpassed expectations and helped give F1&#x27;s most recognisable team another Constructors&#x27; Championship, while Scheckter&#x27;s consistent finishes, with three wins among them, gave him the Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1979. However, he struggled badly in his 1980 title defence, even failing to qualify for the Canadian Grand Prix. After managing only two points, Scheckter announced his retirement from the team and the sport. Scheckter was the last driver to win a Drivers&#x27; Championship for Ferrari until Michael Schumacher twenty-one years later in .

==Other ventures==
===Broadcasting===

In 1981, CBS Sports hired Scheckter as a Pit reporter for its F1 coverage. Scheckter was brought in by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; as a Pit reporter for the 1983 Monaco Grand Prix. Scheckter was a guest commentator for ITV during the 1999 San Marino Grand Prix, replacing Martin Brundle.

Scheckter won the World Superstars competition in 1981, taking place in Key Biscayne, Florida. He defeated athletes such as Russ Francis, Renaldo Nehemiah, Peter Müller, Rick Barry, Gaétan Boucher and Andy Ripley.

===Business===

After his retirement, Scheckter founded a weapons simulation business in 1984 called Firearms Training Systems (FATS), whose revenue eclipsed £100 million by the early 1990s. The company which built firearms training simulators for military, law enforcement and security organisations.

===Farming===
Scheckter spent his time as a biodynamic farmer, having bought the Laverstoke Park Farm, near Overton, Hampshire, south west of London. As an organic farming expert, Scheckter was featured in 2005 on the Visionhealth DVD and TV documentaries &quot;Asthma: An Integrated Approach&quot;, &quot;Arthritis: An Integrated Approach&quot; and &quot;Diabetes: An Integrated Approach&quot;. On 20 November 2011, he also appeared on the &quot;Countryfile&quot; television show to make a case for organic food. Laverstoke Park Farm was also featured on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Escape To the Country&quot; where Scheckter showed viewers how Buffalo Mozzarella was made. In December 2009, Scheckter announced his intention to produce a biodynamic sparkling wine by 2012. In 2015, the farm was the setting for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Free Farm&quot; where a group of celebrities had to go sugar free for two weeks whilst working on the farm.
In 2024, the farm ceased dairy production and buffalo farming with operations at the compost plant not affected and the farm would continue to host carfest.

===Charity===
In 2004, Scheckter was reunited with his championship-winning Ferrari at the South African two-seater F1x2 Charity Grand Prix at Kyalami in South Africa.

==Personal life==

Scheckter is married and has had six children: two, Toby and Tomas, from his previous wife Pamela; and four, Hugo, Freddie, Ila and Poppy, from his current marriage to Clare.

His daughter Ila died on 17 October 2019, at age 21. The sale of his firearms simulation company provided funds to allow Scheckter to help the racing careers of his sons Tomas and Toby. Tomas raced in the Indy Racing League where he won two races. Scheckter&#x27;s elder brother Ian also raced in Formula One.

==Awards and honours==
In 1983, he was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>Moshe Katsav (; born Musa Qassab; 5 December 1945) is an Israeli former politician and a convicted felon who was the eighth President of Israel from 2000 to 2007. He was also a leading Likud member of the Israeli Knesset and a minister in its cabinet. He was the first Mizrahi Jew to be elected to the presidency, and second non-Ashkenazi president after Yitzhak Navon.

The end of his presidency was marked by controversy, stemming from allegations of rape of one female subordinate and sexual harassment of others. Katsav resigned from the presidency in 2007 as part of a plea bargain. Katsav later rejected the deal with prosecutors and vowed he would prove his innocence in court. In an unprecedented case, on 30 December 2010, Katsav was convicted of two counts of rape, obstruction of justice, and other charges. On 22 March 2011, in a landmark ruling, Katsav was sentenced to seven years in prison. Katsav appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Israel. On 10 November 2011, the Supreme Court affirmed Katsav&#x27;s conviction and punishment.

On 7 December 2011, Katsav arrived at Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla to begin serving his seven-year sentence. He was released under restrictive conditions on 21 December 2016, having served five years of his sentence.

==Early life==
Moshe Katsav was born Musa Qassab () in Yazd, Iran, to Persian Jewish parents, Shmuel and Gohar Qassab. His family moved to Tehran when he was a baby, and they emigrated to Israel in 1951. They lived in a tent camp for recent immigrants for several years before the area was developed into the city of Kiryat Malakhi.

After finishing high school, Katsav was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1964, serving in the C4I Corps. He then studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and history in 1971. He married Gila Katsav in 1969. They have five children and two grandchildren.

==Political career==
Katsav joined the Likud Party and was elected mayor of his hometown of Kiryat Malakhi in 1969. He was elected to the Knesset in 1977.

===Cabinet minister===
Katsav was deputy Minister of Construction and Housing from 1981 to 1983 and Minister of Labor and Welfare from 1984 to 1988. He was Transportation Minister from 1988 to 1992 and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism from 1996 to 1999.

Katsav was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1993 Likud leadership election.

The public positions filled by Katsav include the following: Chairman of the Iranian Immigrants Organization; Chairman of the commission to determine higher education tuition; and Member of Ben-Gurion University Board of Trustees.

===Presidency===
After serving as Deputy Prime Minister in Netanyahu&#x27;s government, Katsav vied for the position of President, running as the opposition candidate against Shimon Peres. In a surprising upset, he defeated Peres to become the president of Israel, being elected by the Knesset on 31 July 2000. He took 63 votes (over 57 for Peres), two more than the required majority of 61, and was sworn in on 1 August. He was the first President of Israel to have been sworn in for a seven-year term and the first Likud member to win the office. Katsav&#x27;s victory was attributed in part to evidence that Peres planned to use the position to support the increasingly unpopular peace processes of the government of Ehud Barak.

The office of the Israeli President is largely ceremonial, with no executive powers save pardoning prisoners and commuting sentences. Nevertheless, each president emphasizes different aspects of their role during his tenure. In 2003, on a visit to Italy, he demanded that the Vatican restore treasures allegedly brought to Rome after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD.

On 8 April 2005, the alphabetic ordering of leaders during the funeral of Pope John Paul II resulted in Katsav sitting near Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who, like Katsav, was born in the Iranian province of Yazd. Katsav told the press that he shook Khatami&#x27;s hand and spoke to him in Persian. Khatami later denied this.

==Rape and sexual harassment case==
In July 2006, Katsav complained to the Attorney General of Israel, Menachem Mazuz, that a female employee was blackmailing him. The investigation quickly turned against Katsav as the employee, referred to as &quot;A.&quot; (later identified as Orly Revivo), alleged sexual offenses. A, who worked with Katsav when he was Minister of Tourism, claimed that Katsav raped her twice and sexually harassed her in various other ways. Katsav was accused of raping and sexually harassing up to ten women. Police raided his house and seized computers and documents on 22 August. There were calls for him to resign or suspend himself from the presidency. Katsav was questioned under caution on 23 August.

On 7 September, receiving complaints from at least four different women (according to IBA&#x27;s correspondent for police affairs), the Israel Police determined that they had enough evidence for an indictment. Katsav did not attend the ceremony, swearing-in Dorit Beinisch as President of the Israeli Supreme Court. On 13 September, the Knesset House Committee approved Katsav&#x27;s request for leave of absence. The ceremony, normally held at the president&#x27;s house, was moved to the Knesset.

Police said that seven women had testified against Katsav and the allegations included &quot;breach of trust, fraud, and involvement in illegal wiretapping.&quot; On 18 September, Attorney-General Mazuz stated that the likelihood of Katsav being the victim of a plot was &quot;fairly slim.&quot; By 21 September, the number of complaints rose to eight.

On 15 October 2006, police said the complaints of five of the women would not be pursued because the statute of limitations had run out. On 29 October, Attorney-General Menachem Mazuz advised Katsav to step down. While denying the allegations, he said he would resign if indicted.

===Suspension and resignation===
On 23 January 2007, Attorney-General Mazuz announced that he would consider charging Katsav with rape, sexual harassment, breach of trust, obstruction of justice, harassment of a witness and fraud. The president is immune from prosecution while in office and could only be tried after the end of his term in August 2007 or after his resignation. The final decision on indictment would be made after a hearing where Katsav could present his case.

On 24 January 2007, Katsav held a press conference where he accused journalists of persecuting and judging him before all the evidence was in. He claimed that the media were hostile to his presidency from the start. He accused Channel 2 of conducting a witch-hunt. Katsav declared his intention to suspend himself temporarily but refused to step down unless indicted. The speech drew shock and condemnation from journalists, politicians, and legal figures. In a talk scheduled minutes after Katsav&#x27;s speech, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert called on him to resign from the presidency.

Katsav took a three-month leave of absence approved by the Knesset on 25 January. Knesset Speaker Dalia Itzik assumed the office of president in the interim in a &quot;caretaker&quot; capacity.

On 7 March 2007, an attempt to impeach Katsav failed. By a plea bargain, Katsav resigned effective on 1 July 2007 (his seven-year term was scheduled to run out constitutionally on 15 July 2007).

In March 2009, Katsav&#x27;s brother Lior said the decision to indict Katsav was tantamount to a &quot;blood libel&quot;.

===Plea bargaining and indictment===
On 28 June 2007, Katsav&#x27;s lawyers reached a plea bargain in which Katsav would plead guilty to several counts of sexual harassment and indecent acts and receive a suspended jail sentence. He would pay compensation to two of the victims. The rape charges brought by A. would be dropped, as well as Katsav&#x27;s charges of blackmail. This led to a public outcry, particularly from women&#x27;s rights organizations. Opinion polls showed that 70 percent of the public objected to the deal. A protest at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv drew a large crowd. The Attorney-General claimed the agreement would spare the humiliation of the presidency. Katsav&#x27;s attorneys said they agreed to avoid an arduous trial.

On 30 October 2007, the state prosecutor told the High Court of Justice that it had changed its mind about the indictment based on evidence from the two key complainants. The prosecution cited a meeting with Katsav&#x27;s attorneys that highlighted contradictions in their testimony, including an affectionate letter from one of the complainants after the two rapes allegedly occurred. The move garnered harsh criticism from the complainants&#x27; attorneys. Katsav called off the plea bargain in April 2008. According to one of his lawyers, Avigdor Feldman, he believed the prosecution did not have enough evidence to convict him.

=== Trial ===
In March 2009, Katsav was formally indicted for rape and other sexual offenses in the Tel Aviv District Court. His trial took place between August 2009 and June 2010 before a panel of three judges, consisting of Presiding Judge George Karra and Justices Miriam Sokolov and Yehudit Shevach. Katsav&#x27;s testimony began in January 2010. The prosecutors were Ronit Amiel and Nissim Merom, of the State Prosecutor&#x27;s Office Central District Office. Katsav&#x27;s defense team consisted of attorneys Zion Amir, Avigdor Feldman, and Avraham Lavi. The trial was held behind closed doors (as is customary in trials of sexual offenses) and a media ban was imposed on the details of the trial, witnesses and testimony. The ban was lifted in August 2010 when trial protocols were released.

Without forensic evidence, prosecutors built their case almost entirely on witness testimony. According to legal experts, the similarities in the testimonies of the victims, who could not have known one another, would be instrumental in his conviction.

=== Conviction ===
On 30 December 2010, the three judges unanimously found Katsav guilty of &quot;rape, sexual harassment, committing an indecent act while using force, harassing a witness and obstruction of justice&quot;. Presiding Judge Karra read the verdict which stated that Katsav &quot;engaged in a campaign of vilification against the plaintiffs.&quot; Katsav faced a maximum sentence of 49 years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was &quot;a sad day for Israel&quot;, but that the verdict shows that in Israel &quot;all are equal before the law, and that every woman has exclusive rights to her body.&quot; The conviction was described as &quot;landmark&quot; and &quot;unprecedented&quot;, and the story featured prominently in the international media. The sentencing phase began on 22 February 2011.

On 22 March 2011, Moshe Katsav was sentenced to seven years in prison and two years&#x27; probation for rape, indecent acts, sexual harassment and obstruction of justice, becoming the first former President of Israel to be sentenced to prison. In addition, he was ordered to pay one of the women compensation totaling 100,000 NIS and another a sum of 25,000 NIS. Katsav&#x27;s lawyer Zion Amir told reporters that the sentence would be appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel.

In July 2011, it was cleared for publication that Katsav was under police investigation on suspicion of using private investigators to harass witnesses and a complainant. Police suspected the investigators were trying to obtain new evidence to undermine their credibility. It was thought that Katsav hired the investigators after he was found guilty and before the Supreme Court appeal was filed. Katsav, his brothers Lior and Yoram, and his son Noam were questioned for an hour by National Fraud Investigations Unit officers on suspicion of witness harassment, tampering, and invasion of privacy.

In May 2011, Supreme Court Justice Yoram Danziger granted Katsav&#x27;s motion to delay his entrance to prison until the Supreme Court heard his appeal. Deliberations on the appeal began on 7 August 2011 and were conducted by a three-judge panel consisting of Justices Edna Arbel, Miriam Naor, and Salim Joubran. Katsav&#x27;s attorney suggested that his client was sexually involved with one of the alleged victims, but no rape occurred. He also suggested that the plaintiffs&#x27; testimonies were filled with contradictions. When deliberations resumed on 10 August, Katsav&#x27;s attorney suggested that his client&#x27;s actions did not constitute anything beyond &quot;an ordinary hug&quot;. Deliberations on the appeal adjourned on 11 August. The court delivered its opinion on 10 November, unanimously upholding Katsav&#x27;s conviction and sentence. The three-judge panel stated that they refrained from assessing the truth of the statements made by the accusers and otherwise rejected possibly exculpatory evidence. Justice Salim Joubran stated that Katsav &quot;fell from the loftiest heights to the deepest depths. Such a senior official should be a role model to his subordinates. Every woman has a right to her own body. A right to dignity. A right to freedom. No one has the liberty to take any of those from her&quot;. Katsav was given until 7 December to put his affairs in order.

=== Prison ===

Following the decision, Katsav&#x27;s family turned to several politicians, asking that Katsav&#x27;s home, already surrounded by stone walls put up by Shin Bet&#x27;s Protective Security Department, be declared a &quot;temporary prison&quot;, and that he be allowed to serve his sentence there. In a letter to Public Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovich, Katsav&#x27;s brother Lior wrote that while in prison, his brother could be exposed to convicts whose presidential pardon requests he had rejected and claimed that he knew state secrets that could be compromised in prison. Aharonovich rejected that request, with sources close to him stating that prisoners were only permitted to serve their sentences at home in extremely rare cases.

Katsav arrived at Maasiyahu Prison in Ramla at 10:08 a.m. on 7 December 2011 to begin serving his sentence. Before departing for prison, he addressed journalists outside his home and maintained his innocence. Dozens of police officers were deployed to the prison to maintain order, and there was a large domestic and foreign media presence. Prison authorities determined that Katsav did not pose a suicide risk, and it was decided that the cameras in his cell would only be activated when his cellmate was absent.

Katsav was Israel Prison Service inmate #1418989. His cell was in the prison&#x27;s Torani cellblock, a special block for religious prisoners. Though considered less harsh than other blocs, inmates in the Torani bloc have no access to television or newspapers. Prisoners are woken at 4:30 a.m. for morning prayers, pray three times a day, and spend most of the day in two seminaries studying Torah and other sacred Jewish texts. Shlomo Benizri, another former politician in prison for corruption, was Katsav&#x27;s cellmate until his 2012 release. During his sentence, Katsav was bullied and harassed by convicted mass murderer Ami Popper, who Katsav had refused to pardon during his term in office. Popper&#x27;s behavior resulted in his being transferred to another prison.

It was announced on 15 October 2012 that Israel&#x27;s President Shimon Peres received a formal request to pardon Katsav. The request came from Katsav&#x27;s wife, Gila.

The prison parole board rejected a request by Moshe Katsav for a conditional early release from prison on 6 April 2016. It is allowed by Israeli law to release a prisoner after serving two-thirds of a term. The parole board decided that Katsav, who always maintained he was innocent and never expressed any regret for his actions and also refused to take part in rehabilitation programs, could continue to harass the victims and still posed a risk to women.

===Release===
On 18 December 2016, the parole board granted Katsav early release, announcing that he had expressed regret for his actions before it, even though he had failed to do so publicly. The parole board delayed his release for a week, allowing prosecutors to consider whether to appeal. On 21 December 2016, Katsav was released from prison after the State Attorney decided not to appeal the Parole Board&#x27;s decision for early release.

Katsav served a total of 5 years and 15 days of his 7-year sentence. The Prisoner Rehabilitation Authority imposed parole restrictions to be followed for the remainder of his 7-year sentence. Under the terms of his parole, he was prohibited from making any statements to the media or leaving the country. He was required to attend rehabilitation and visit a psychologist once a week, attend daily Torah study sessions, and remain at his home under a curfew from 10 PM to 6 AM. He was also forbidden from discussing or defaming his victims or holding any position where women are his subordinates.

In August 2017, President Reuven Rivlin rejected an appeal from Katsav to cancel the conditions of his parole. A parole board rejected a request to lift his nighttime curfew in November 2017. In April 2018, the Lod District Court rejected an appeal to cancel his nighttime curfew.

<text>Nivkh ( ; occasionally also Nivkhic; self-designation: Нивхгу диф, &quot;Nivhgu dif&quot;, ), or Gilyak ( ), or Amuric, is a small language family, often portrayed as a language isolate, of two or three mutually unintelligible languages spoken by the Nivkh people in Outer Manchuria, in the basin of the Amgun (a tributary of the Amur), along the lower reaches of the Amur itself, and on the northern half of Sakhalin. &quot;Gilyak&quot; is the Russian rendering of terms derived from the Tungusic &quot;Gileke&quot; and Manchu-Chinese &quot;Gilemi&quot; (Gilimi, Gilyami) for culturally similar peoples of the Amur River region, and was applied principally to the Nivkh in Western literature.

The population of ethnic Nivkhs has been reasonably stable over the past century, with 4,549 Nivkhs counted in 1897 and 4,673 in 1989. However, the number of native speakers of the Nivkh language among these dropped from 100% to 23.3% in the same period, so by the 1989 census there were only 1,079 first-language speakers left. That may have been an overcount, however, as the 2010 census recorded only 198 native speakers, less than 4% of the ethnic population.

Proto-Nivkh(ic), the proto-language ancestral to the modern-day languages, has been reconstructed by Fortescue (2016).

==Languages==
Nivkh is a dialect continuum. There is a high degree of variability of usage among Nivkhs depending on village, clan, and even the individual speaker. Varieties are traditionally grouped into four geographic clusters. These are the lower-Amur variety, the North Sakhalin variety (spoken on the coasts around the Amur Liman, including the mainland and west Sakhalin), the East Sakhalin variety (including populations around the Tymy River), and the South Sakhalin variety (spoken around the Poronay River). The lexical and phonological differences across these varieties is great enough that specialists describe them as falling into two or three languages, though for purposes of language revival among a small and already divided population, Nivkh is generally presented as a single language, due to fears of the consequences of further division.

Gruzdeva (1998) notes that speakers of East Sakhalin and the lower Amur cannot understand each other, and divides the varieties into two languages, Nivkh proper (including the lower Amur, Northern Sakhalin / Straits and Western Sakhalin varieties) and Nighvng (the East and South Sakhalin varieties). Fortescue (2016) notes that the Amur, East Sakhalin and South Sakhalin varieties have low intelligibility with each other, and considers each of them to constitute a separate language.

==Classification==
Nivkh is not known to be related to any other language, making it a language isolate. For convenience, it may be included in the geographical group of Paleosiberian languages. Many words in the Nivkh languages bear a certain resemblance to words of similar meaning in other Paleosiberian languages, Ainu, Korean, or Tungusic languages, but no regular sound correspondences have been discovered to systematically account for the vocabularies of these various families, so any lexical similarities are considered to be due to chance or to borrowing.

Michael Fortescue suggested in 1998 that Nivkh might be related to the Mosan languages of North America. Later, in 2011, he argued that Nivkh, which he referred to as an &quot;isolated Amuric language&quot;, was related to the Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages, forming a Chukotko-Kamchatkan–Amuric language family. However, &quot;Glottolog&quot; considers the evidence to be &quot;insufficient&quot;.

In 2015, Sergei Nikolaev argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between Nivkh and the Algic languages of North America, and a more distant relationship between these two together and the Wakashan languages of coastal British Columbia.

The Nivkh languages are included in the widely rejected Eurasiatic languages hypothesis by Joseph Greenberg.

An automated computational analysis (ASJP 4) by Müller et al. (2013) found lexical similarities among Nivkh, Mongolic, and Tungusic, likely due to lexical borrowings.

Hudson &amp; Robbeets (2020) presumed that a Nivkh-like language was once distributed in Korea and became the substratum of Koreanic languages. Kim Bang-han proposed that placename glosses in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; reflect the original language of the Korean peninsula and a component in the formation of both Korean and Japanese. He proposed that this language was related to Nivkh. Juha Janhunen suggests the possibility that similar consonant stop systems in Koreanic and Nivkh may be due to ancient contact.

== History ==
The Nivkh people have lived, by many accounts for thousands of years, on the island of Sakhalin and the Amur River. They maintained trade with the neighboring Ainu, Japanese, and Chinese, until Russian contact, which began in the 17th century. The 19th century shows the first recorded decline of Nivkh numbers, with official estimates dropping from 1856 to 1889. This coincided with smallpox epidemics and the expansion of Sakhalin&#x27;s prisoner population, as Russia began sending groups of its convicts to Sakhalin in 1873. At this time, reportedly few Nivkh spoke Russian.

The official Russian census reported similar numbers of ethnic Nivkhs in 1897 (4,500) and in 2002 (5,200). However, the number of native speakers among the ethnic Nivkhs dropped from 100% to 23.3% in the same period. All recorded native Nivkh speakers were bilingual in Russian, most of them were born in 1920-1940s, when a significant decline in the number of native Nivkh speakers occurred, due to Joseph Stalin&#x27;s policy of collectivization imposed on indigenous economies, and in many cases, driving Nivkh individuals to hired labor, marking a departure from traditional means of subsistence. Many Nivkh were forcibly displaced from their more widely spread settlements to Nogliki, a small city, in the process of centralization. The traditional Nivkh way of life was gradually and sometimes forcibly converted to a Soviet way of life, as changes in subsistence, diet, dwellings, and education have resulted. As of the 2010s, the Nivkh language was taught in grades 1–3 in several schools in both Sakhalin and Khabarovsk Krai. A monthly newspaper &quot;Nivkh dif&quot; (Nivkh language) is published in Sakhalin. Nivkh language books are also regularly published in Russia.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The labial fricatives are weakly articulated, and have been described as both bilabial and labiodental . The palatal stops may have some degree of affrication, as . After nasals or , the unaspirated stops become voiced . Unlike consonant alternation, this can occur within a morpheme. The Amur dialect deletes some word-final nasals, which leads to word-initial voiced stops, allophonic in other dialects, being phonemic in Amur. The voiceless trill is realized as in East Sakhalin dialect (and presumably also in Amur dialect, where it is written ) and as an untrilled in North Sakhalin dialect. 

Consonants are palatalized in some contexts, most commonly in younger speakers, where all consonants are palatalized before and . Additionally, there is another context in which consonants are always palatalised, viz. before when it precedes a uvular consonant , e.g. &gt; ‘chicken’.

Nivkh features a process of consonant alternation like in Celtic languages, in which morpheme-initial stops alternate with fricatives and trills:

This occurs when a morpheme is preceded by another morpheme within the same phrase (e.g. a prefix or an adjunct), unless the preceding morpheme ends itself in a fricative or trill, or in a nasal or .
* &#x27;soup&#x27;
* &#x27;duck soup&#x27;
* &#x27;kind of seal soup&#x27;
* but: &#x27;bear soup&#x27;

Only the morpheme-initial position is affected: other clusters ending in a stop are possible within a morpheme (e.g. &quot;man&quot;).

In some transitive verbs, the process has been noted to apparently run in reverse (fricatives/trills fortiting to stops, with the same distribution). This has been taken a distinct process, but has also been explained to be fundamentally the same, with the citation form of these verbs containing an underlying stop, lenited due to the presence of a former &quot;i-&quot; prefix (which still survives in the citation form of other verbs, where it causes regular consonant alternation). Initial fricatives in nouns never change.

===Vowels===
There are these six vowels in Nivkh:

Long vowels are not a phonemic feature of Nivkh but can arise due to sentence prosody, or compensatory lengthening when fricatives are deleted after the vowel.

===Stress===
Stress can fall on any syllable, but tends to be on the first; there is dialectal variation, and minimal pairs distinguished by stress seem to be rare.

==Alphabet==
The Nivkh language uses a Cyrillic alphabet. 

Other letters of the Russian alphabet are only used for Russian loan words. Various allographs of the letters with descenders are found, and &quot;er&quot; may take either a breve or a caron. The allographs listed first in the table above are the choice of &quot;Нивх диф&quot;, the only Nivkh newspaper. 

The letters Д, Н and Т stands for two sounds each. When they are followed by a iotized vowel letter, or at the end of a syllable followed by ь, they stand for the affricate or palatal consonants ; otherwise they stand for the alveolar consonants . At the beginning of a syllable, the letters Е, Ё, Ю, Я stands for .

The letter Ӷ is not used in Amur dialect, while is spelled РШ.

==Grammar==
Nivkh is an agglutinating synthetic language. It has a developed case system, as well as other grammatical markers, but no grammatical gender. The basic word order of Nivkh is subject–object–verb, the subject being frequently omitted in speech. Nivkh is notable for the high degree of incorporation between words. For example, morphemes that express spatial relationships (prepositions or postpositions in many other languages) are incorporated into the noun to which they relate. Words consist of easily definable roots and productive grammatical morphemes, most of which are suffixes. Nivkh has no adjectives, but rather verbs that describe a state of being. There are two verb tenses: non-future and future. The non-future form may combine with adverbials, as well as context, to indicate a time frame.

As Russian has become the dominant language in all spheres of life, Nivkh grammar has changed in the last century. For example, Nivkh has recently begun to mark plurals on counting nouns and pairs, a change that originated from the grammar rules of Russian. However, it has been postulated that due to the vastly differing grammatical structures of the two tongues, grammatical interference has not been extensive. Simplification has occurred past borrowed Russian structure, though; due to disuse of the language and a changing culture, many of the complex morphological aspects of Nivkh have been simplified or fallen out of use. In a process referred to as obsolescence, things like the distinction between the morpheme for counting sledges and the morpheme for counting fishnets has disappeared, with speakers opting to use more general categories of counting numbers or other descriptors.

==Language contact with the Ainu people==
The Ainu appear to have experienced intensive contact with the Nivkhs during the course of their history. It is not known to what extent this has affected the language. Linguists believe the vocabulary shared between the Ainu language and Nivkh (historically spoken in the northern half of Sakhalin and on the Asian mainland facing it) is due to borrowing.

<text>The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is a United States–based international nonprofit with the stated mission of promoting cooperation among scientists, defending scientific freedom, encouraging scientific responsibility, and supporting scientific education and science outreach for the betterment of all humanity. AAAS was the first permanent organization established to promote science and engineering nationally and to represent the interests of American researchers from across all scientific fields. It is the world&#x27;s largest general scientific society, with over 120,000 members, and is the publisher of the well-known scientific journal &quot;Science&quot;.

==History==
===Creation===
The American Association for the Advancement of Science was created on September 20, 1848, at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was a reformation of the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists with the broadened mission to be the first permanent organization to promote science and engineering nationally and to represent the interests of American researchers from across all scientific fields The society chose William Charles Redfield as their first president because he had proposed the most comprehensive plans for the organization. According to the first constitution which was agreed to at the September 20 meeting, the goal of the society was to promote scientific dialogue in order to allow for greater scientific collaboration. By doing so, the association aimed to use resources to conduct science with increased efficiency and allow for scientific progress at a greater rate. The association also sought to increase the resources available to the scientific community through active advocacy of science. There were only 78 members when the AAAS was formed. As a member of the new scientific body, Matthew Fontaine Maury, USN was one of those who attended the first 1848 meeting.

At a meeting held on Friday afternoon, September 22, 1848, Redfield presided, and Matthew Fontaine Maury gave a full scientific report on his &quot;Wind and Current Charts&quot;. Maury stated that hundreds of ship navigators were now sending abstract logs of their voyages to the United States Naval Observatory. He added, &quot;Never before was such a corps of observers known.&quot; 

William Barton Rogers, professor at the University of Virginia and later founder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered a resolution: &quot;Resolved that a Committee of five be appointed to address a memorial to the Secretary of the Navy, requesting his further aid in procuring for Matthew Maury the use of the observations of European and other foreign navigators, for the extension and perfecting of his charts of winds and currents.&quot; The resolution was adopted and, in addition to Rogers, the following members of the association were appointed to the committee: Professor Joseph Henry of Washington; Professor Benjamin Peirce of Cambridge, Massachusetts; Professor James H. Coffin of Easton, Pennsylvania, and Professor Stephen Alexander of Princeton, New Jersey. This was scientific cooperation, and Maury went back to Washington with great hopes for the future.

In 1850, the first female members were accepted: astronomer Maria Mitchell and entomologist Margaretta Morris. Science educator Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps was elected in 1859.

===Early growth and post-Civil War dormancy===
By 1860, membership increased to over 2,000. Although the AAAS became dormant during the American Civil War (their August 1861 meeting in Nashville, Tennessee, was postponed indefinitely after the outbreak of the first major engagement of the war at Bull Run), the association recovered after the end of the hostilities.

In 1866, Frederick Barnard presided over the first meeting of the resurrected AAAS at a meeting in New York City. Following the revival of the AAAS, the group had considerable growth. The AAAS permitted all people, regardless of scientific credentials, to join. The AAAS did, however, institute a policy of granting the title of &quot;Fellow of the AAAS&quot; to well-respected scientists within the organization. 

At the same time, the recovered AAAS faced competition from several newly established learned societies, such as National Academy of Sciences (founded in 1863), the American Chemical Society (1876), Archaeological Institute of America (1879), Modern Language Association (1883), American Historical Association(1884), Geological Society of America (1888), National Geographic Society (1888), American Physical Society (1899), which drew away some of AAAS members. Also, the reputation of the AAAS was somewhat tarnished, because its 3rd president Alexander Dallas Bache used the Society as a lobbying tool for his agency, the US Coast Survey. Several prominent scientists lost interest in the AAAS, and the society&#x27;s influence declined.

===Twentieth century===

The next turning point in the AAS history was the partnership with journal &quot;Science&quot;, which became the society&#x27;s official publication in 1900, and provided the AAAS with some revenue through subscription and advertising. The AAAS become the sole owner of &quot;Science&quot; in 1946. The post–World War II big science, driven by major scientific and technical breakthroughs (such as space flight, nuclear power and the discovery of DNA) brought in an increased public interest in science in the USA, and thus growing sales of the journal, which were further multiplied by shrewd businesses decisions by its editors Dael Wolfle (1954-1970) and William D. Carey (1974-1985). Another important event for the society was the establishment of its Congressional Fellowship program in 1973, which was kick-started by a US$10,000 donation from William T. Golden.

===Advocacy===
Alan I. Leshner, AAAS CEO from 2001 until 2015, published many op-ed articles discussing how many people integrate science and religion in their lives. He has opposed the insertion of non-scientific content, such as creationism or intelligent design, into the scientific curriculum of schools.

In December 2006, the AAAS adopted an official statement on climate change, in which they stated, &quot;The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society...The pace of change and the evidence of harm have increased markedly over the last five years. The time to control greenhouse gas emissions is now.&quot;

In February 2007, the AAAS used satellite images to document human rights abuses in Burma. The next year, AAAS launched the Center for Science Diplomacy to advance both science and the broader relationships among partner countries, by promoting science diplomacy and international scientific cooperation.

In 2012, AAAS published op-eds, held events on Capitol Hill and released analyses of the U.S. federal research-and-development budget, to warn that a budget sequestration would have severe consequences for scientific progress.

==Governance==

The most recent Constitution of the AAAS, enacted on January 1, 1973, establishes that the governance of the AAAS is accomplished through four entities: a President, a group of administrative officers, a Council, and a board of directors.

===Presidents===

Individuals elected to the presidency of the AAAS hold a three-year term in a unique way. The first year is spent as president-elect, the second as president and the third as chairperson of the board of directors. In accordance with the convention followed by the AAAS, presidents are referenced by the year in which they left office.

Geraldine Richmond is the president of AAAS for 2015–16; Phillip Sharp is the board chair; and Barbara A. Schaal is the president-elect. Each took office on the last day of the 2015 AAAS Annual Meeting in February 2015. On the last day of the 2016 AAAS Annual Meeting, February 15, 2016, Richmond will become the chair, Schaal will become the president, and a new president-elect will take office.

Past presidents of AAAS have included some of the most important scientific figures of their time. Among them: explorer and geologist John Wesley Powell (1888); astronomer and physicist Edward Charles Pickering (1912); anthropologist Margaret Mead (1975); and biologist Stephen Jay Gould (2000).

These are the executive officer, the treasurer and then each of the AAAS&#x27;s section secretaries. The current CEO of AAAS and executive publisher of &quot;Science&quot; magazine is Sudip Parikh. The current Editor in Chief of Science magazine is Holden Thorp.

====Sections of the AAAS====
The AAAS has 24 &quot;sections&quot; with each section being responsible for a particular concern of the AAAS. There are sections for agriculture, anthropology, astronomy, atmospheric science, biological science, chemistry, dentistry, education, engineering, general interest in science and engineering, geology and geography, the history and philosophy of science, technology, computer science, linguistics, mathematics, medical science, neuroscience, pharmaceutical science, physics, psychology, science and human rights, social and political science, the social impact of science and engineering, and statistics.

====Affiliates====
AAAS affiliates include 262 societies and academies of science, serving more than 10 million members, from the Acoustical Society of America to the Wildlife Society, as well as non-mainstream groups like the Parapsychological Association.

===The Council===

The council is composed of the members of the Board of Directors, the retiring section chairmen, elected delegates and affiliated foreign council members. Among the elected delegates there are always at least two members from the National Academy of Sciences and one from each region of the country. The President of the AAAS serves as the Chairperson of the council. Members serve the council for a term of three years.

The council meets annually to discuss matters of importance to the AAAS. They have the power to review all activities of the Association, elect new fellows, adopt resolutions, propose amendments to the Association&#x27;s constitution and bylaws, create new scientific sections, and organize and aid local chapters of the AAAS. The Council recently has new additions to it from different sections which include many youngsters as well. John Kerry of Chicago is the youngest American in the council and Akhil Ennamsetty of India is the youngest foreign council member.

===Board of directors===
The board of directors is composed of a chairperson, the president, and the president-elect along with eight elected directors, the executive officer of the association and up to two additional directors appointed by elected officers. Members serve a four-year term except for directors appointed by elected officers, who serve three-year terms.

The current chairman is Gerald Fink, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor at Whitehead Institute, MIT. Fink will serve in the post until the end of the 2016 AAAS Annual Meeting, 15 February 2016. (The chairperson is always the immediate past-president of AAAS.)

The board of directors has a variety of powers and responsibilities. It is charged with the administration of all association funds, publication of a budget, appointment of administrators, proposition of amendments, and determining the time and place of meetings of the national association. The board may also speak publicly on behalf of the association. The board must also regularly correspond with the council to discuss their actions.

==AAAS Fellows==

The AAAS council elects every year, its members who are distinguished scientifically, to the grade of fellow (FAAAS). Election to AAAS is an honor bestowed by their peers and elected fellows are presented with a certificate and rosette pin. To limit the effects and tolerance of sexual harassment in the sciences, starting 15 October 2018, a Fellow&#x27;s status can be revoked &quot;in cases of proven scientific misconduct, serious breaches of professional ethics, or when the Fellow in the view of the AAAS otherwise no longer merits the status of Fellow.&quot;

==Meetings==
Formal meetings of the AAAS are numbered consecutively, starting with the first meeting in 1848. Meetings were not held 1861–1865 during the American Civil War, and also 1942–1943 during World War II. Since 1946, one meeting has occurred annually, now customarily in February.

== Awards and Policy Fellowships ==
Each year, the AAAS gives out a number of honorary awards, most of which focus on science communication, journalism, and outreach – sometimes in partnership with other organizations. The awards recognize &quot;scientists, journalists, and public servants for significant contributions to science and to the public&#x27;s understanding of science&quot;. The awards are presented each year at the association&#x27;s annual meeting.

In addition to the aforementioned Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science program, AAAS offers a similarly-sounding but completely unrelated AAAS Policy Fellowship Programs, which provide Ph.D. scientists and M.S. engineers with opportunities to serve in the federal government. These policy fellows spend one or two years working for the executive (130 positions), legislative (5 positions) or judicial (1 position) branches.

They also publish the non-peer-reviewed &quot;Science &amp; Diplomacy&quot;. 
The society previously published the review journal &quot;Science Books &amp; Films&quot; (SB&amp;F).
AAAS also publishes on behalf of other organizations through the Science Partner Journals (SPJ) program, with a focus on online-only open access journals.

==SciLine==
SciLine is a philanthropically funded and editorially independent service for journalists and scientists. Its launch was announced in an October 27, 2017 article in Science by founding director Rick Weiss, former communications chief at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and science reporter at the Washington Post. Its stated mission is to increase the amount and quality of research-backed evidence in news stories by connecting U.S. journalists to scientists and to validated scientific information.

Reporters in the United States can access SciLine&#x27;s services, which include expert-matching, general media briefings, expert quote sheets, and quick fact sheets. As of July 2021, SciLine had fulfilled approximately 2,000 requests from 650 journalists through its expert-matching service.

SciLine&#x27;s financial supporters include the Quadrivium Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Rita Allen Foundation, and the Heinz Endowments. AAAS provides in-kind support.

==EurekAlert!==
In 1996, AAAS launched the EurekAlert! website, an editorially independent nonprofit news release distribution service covering all areas of science, medicine and technology. EurekAlert! provides news in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, and, from 2007, in Chinese.

Working staff journalists and freelancers who meet eligibility guidelines can access the latest studies before publication and obtain embargoed information in compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s Regulation Fair Disclosure policy. By early 2018, more than 14,000 reporters from more than 90 countries have registered for free access to embargoed materials. More than 5,000 active public information officers from 2,300 universities, academic journals, government agencies, and medical centers are credentialed to provide new releases to reporters and the public through the system.

In 1998, European science organizations countered Eurekalert! with a press release distribution service AlphaGalileo.

EurekAlert! has fallen under criticism for lack of press release standards and for generating churnalism.

<text>John Fitzwilliam Stairs, also known as John Fitz William Stairs (January 19, 1848 – September 26, 1904) was an entrepreneur and statesman, born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a member of the prominent Stairs family of merchants and shippers founded by William Machin Stairs (1789–1865) that included the Victorian era explorer, William Grant Stairs.

Known as &quot;John F.&quot;, he studied at Dalhousie University and then entered the management of the family&#x27;s vast business empire. He was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1879, resigning in 1882 to successfully run for election to the House of Commons of Canada in Ottawa where he served as a Conservative Party member until 1896.

Stairs was president of many companies, including Nova Scotia Steel, Eastern Trust, Trinidad Electric (B.W.I.) and Royal Securities Corporation. He served as director of the Dartmouth and Halifax Steamboat Company, Nova Scotia Sugar Refining, the Union Bank of Halifax, Consumer Cordage, and during his lifetime, came to dominate the financial elite of the Maritime provinces.

He also employed Max Aitken (later, Lord Beaverbrook) at the beginning of Aitken&#x27;s business career, hiring him in 1902 when he set up Royal Securities, the first investment firm in Eastern Canada. Max Aitken was at Stairs&#x27; bedside when he died in Toronto, Ontario. His remains were sent to Halifax where he was buried in the Fairview Cemetery.

<doc id="243066" wikidata="Q166315" url="?curid=243066" title="Sanctuary (band)">
<text>Sanctuary is an American heavy metal band, formed in 1985 in Seattle, Washington. They were broken up from 1992 to 2010. The band consists of Lenny Rutledge (guitar), Joseph Michael (vocals), George Hernandez (bass), and Dave Budbill (drums). The lead vocalist position was held by Warrel Dane until his death in 2017. They have released four studio albums and one live EP.

Despite never reaching mainstream success, Sanctuary is often credited for popularizing the 1980s and early 1990s Seattle hard rock and heavy metal scene, which spawned bands such as Mother Love Bone, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Queensrÿche, Metal Church, Fifth Angel, TKO, Culprit, Rail, Forced Entry and Q5.

== History ==
=== Initial career (1985–1992) ===
Sanctuary was founded by cousins and guitarists Lenny Rutledge and Sean Blosl. The band started with playing covers and original songs until their line-up was complete. After singer Warrel Dane had joined, Sanctuary played only original songs and recorded their first demo, which received prominent airplay for a year on college radion station KCMU. When singer and guitarist Dave Mustaine played a concert with his band Megadeth in Seattle, the band were able to present the demo to Mustaine after the show in his hotel room. Mustaine liked it and promised to produce the band.

Afterwards, Sanctuary played a few support shows for Megadeth and then recorded &quot;Refuge Denied&quot; with Mustaine as producer. Keith Rawls, Megadeth&#x27;s then-manager, who would become Sanctuary&#x27;s manager as well, contacted record companies and finally secured a deal with Epic Records. The label remixed the debut album and released it in 1988. Sanctuary subsequently toured worldwide in support of the album, playing with bands such as Megadeth, Warlock, Savatage, Testament, Nuclear Assault, Flotsam and Jetsam, Vio-lence, Fates Warning, Meliah Rage and Forced Entry.

In 1989, after the &quot;Refuge Denied&quot; tour ended, Sanctuary entered the studio to record their second studio album, &quot;Into the Mirror Black&quot;, which was released in 1990. A video clip for the song &quot;Future Tense&quot; was made and received some airplay on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. While touring in support of the album (with bands such as Fates Warning, Morbid Angel, Forbidden, Death Angel, Forced Entry and Blitzspeer), guitarist Sean Blosl left the band and was replaced by Jeff Loomis.

Shortly after, pressure from Epic Records to fit in with the flourishing Seattle grunge scene caused disagreements between band members regarding the band&#x27;s musical direction. In 1992, Sanctuary officially disbanded.

Epic Records was to release a full-length live recording from this final tour, but only a limited number of copies of a promotional live EP ever saw the light of day. It was named &quot;Into the Mirror Live&quot;.

&quot;Refuge Denied&quot; and &quot;Into the Mirror Black&quot; were re-released as a double CD set by IronBird Records on February 22, 2010.

=== Post-breakup (1992–2010) ===
After disbanding, Warrel Dane, Jim Sheppard and Jeff Loomis formed the band Nevermore in 1992. Lenny Rutledge became a musical producer, and has his own studio. Additionally, he helped Nevermore on the demo sessions of their 1998 album, &quot;Dreaming Neon Black&quot;. Nevermore eventually went on hiatus in April 2011 after 19 years and 7 studio albums.

=== Reunion and &quot;The Year the Sun Died&quot; (2010–2015) ===

In 2010, four of the founding Sanctuary members — Warrel Dane, Jim Sheppard, Lenny Rutledge and Dave Budbill — came together for a few select reunion performances. At first, it was just going to be a handful of shows, but the response and chemistry on stage was so overwhelming that they decided to reunite permanently. The band&#x27;s first shows after included Jeff Loomis as a second guitarist, though he departed simultaneously to his departure from Nevermore. Former Forced Entry guitarist Brad Hull, who had earlier touring experience with the band, became a permanent member shortly after.

A US appearance in 2011 took take place at ProgPower USA in Atlanta on Friday, September 16, 2011. The band also played on the 70000 Tons of Metal festival on board Royal Caribbeans&#x27; Majesty of the Seas in January 2011 on the same date as Nevermore. In January 2013 Sanctuary got a deal with Century Media.

Regarding how the reunion came about, Dane told Rock My Monkey TV, &quot;[Sanctuary guitarist Lenny Rutledge and I] always talked to each other, but never really been friends again. And when the whole thing came about, that we were actually friends again, that&#x27;s when we started talking more about doing it. And it definitely wasn&#x27;t because Nevermore was imploding ... which it was, at that point ... We all just started talking with each other again. That was kind of the groundwork for it. And then we started saying, &#x27;Well, gosh, let&#x27;s make music again.&#x27; And my god! Lenny is writing some stuff that is so friggin great! Obviously, he&#x27;s been bottling this up for years, because he really hasn&#x27;t been doing anything ... Well, he&#x27;s had bands here and there. But he&#x27;s really writing some great stuff that&#x27;s really inspiring me, and making me fall in love with music again, with the creative process ... everything that revolves around that. Really inspiring me to write really evil lyrics.&quot;

On the topic of the sound of the comeback album, Dane said, &quot;This record is not going to sound like the other two. It might sound very similar to the second one (&#x27;Into The Mirror Black&#x27;). It&#x27;s definitely not going to sound like the first one, because we&#x27;re all a little bit older and I can&#x27;t come up with a c-clamp for a scrotum and a helium tank ... It&#x27;s not going to sound like the old ones ... it&#x27;s 2011. It&#x27;s still gonna be that good, I think, and there&#x27;s gonna be high-pitched screaming. I&#x27;m making sure of that. With Nevermore, high-pitched screaming was never really called for. You know, with Sanctuary ... of course it is.&quot;

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;The Year the Sun Died&quot;, was finished in June 2014 and released on October 14 in North America and October 6 in Europe via Century Media. It was produced by Zeuss. The track listing was revealed in August 2014, artwork and the song &quot;Arise and Purify&quot; made available. A lyric video for &quot;Exitium (Anthem of the Living)&quot; was released shortly thereafter, with the video for single &quot;Frozen&quot; debuting on October 7. Ultimately, three songs on the album did feature Dane&#x27;s trademark high-pitched vocals, though the majority of the singing was more in line with the baritone and bass vocals that were featured prominently in Nevermore.

In February 2015, Brad Hull&#x27;s departure was announced, with guitarist Nick Cordle, formerly of Arsis and Arch Enemy, filling in for March and April tour dates. His future status with the band is currently unclear. Warrel Dane said the split with Brad Hull was due to &quot;personal things that happened&quot;, that are better not to discuss in public, but said they are still friends. Zeuss [a.k.a. Chris Harris], their producer for &quot;The Year the Sun Died&quot;, recruited Nick Cordle for the band when they found out Brad Hull would not be doing the European tour, since canceling the tour was not an option.

=== &quot;Dead Again&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot; (2015–2017) ===

Asked in October 2015 if Sanctuary had been writing new material for a fourth album, frontman Warrel Dane replied, 

Pictures posted on the band&#x27;s Facebook page on April 22, 2016, included a reference to ex-Panic bassist George Hernandez, who had filled in for Sheppard on tour the previous year, as the band&#x27;s new permanent bassist.

In another interview by September 2016 Dane revealed &quot;Dead Again&quot; as a tentative title for the new album. He said that it would come &quot;next year, but late next year&quot;. Dane described the material as &quot;way faster and more like old-school thrash metal, but sounding a bit modern and it&#x27;s f ... cking heavy.&quot; He also announced the compilation of old demos and songs named &quot;Inception&quot;, that could arrive &quot;in a few months&quot;.

=== Death of Warrel Dane and the future of the band (2017–present) ===
On December 13, 2017, it was reported that Dane had died of a heart attack in São Paulo, Brazil, where he was recording his second solo album.

The band toured North America with Iced Earth in February and March 2018 for the tribute to Dane tour with Witherfall vocalist Joseph Michael filling in on vocals. Current Armageddon guitarist Joey Concepcion of Milford, Connecticut has joined the tour on guitar. The tour was well-received, prompting Rutledge and Michael to begin working on demos to potentially continue the band.

Former guitarist Sean Blosl died in a traffic collision in Seattle, on August 26, 2024, at the age of 58.

<doc id="243068" wikidata="Q1068011" url="?curid=243068" title="Chase Field">
<text>Chase Field, formerly Bank One Ballpark, is a retractable-roof stadium in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. It is the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Arizona Diamondbacks. It opened in 1998, the year the Diamondbacks debuted as an expansion team. Chase Field was the first stadium built in the United States with a retractable roof over a natural grass playing surface, although it has used artificial turf since 2019.

==History==
The park was built during a wave of new, baseball-only parks in the 1990s. Although nearly all of those parks were open-air, it was taken for granted that a domed stadium was a must for a major-league team to be viable in the Phoenix area. Phoenix is by far the hottest major city in North America; the average high temperature during baseball&#x27;s regular season is , and game-time temperatures well above are common during the summer.

===Stadium funding===
In the spring of 1994, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors approved a 0.25 percent increase in the county sales tax to pay for their portion of the stadium funding. That happened during a huge county budget deficit and lack of funding for other services. The sales tax was very unpopular with local citizens, who were not permitted to vote on funding a baseball stadium with general sales tax revenue (use of public subsidies for stadium projects was prohibited by a 1989 referendum). The issue was so controversial and divisive that, in August 1997, Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox was shot and injured while leaving a county board meeting by Larry Naman, a homeless man, who attempted to argue in court that her support for the tax justified his attack. In May 1998, Naman was found guilty of attempted first-degree murder.

The cost of the stadium was estimated at $279 million in 1995, but cost overruns, in part because of rising prices for steel and other materials, pushed the cost to $364 million. As part of the stadium deal, the Diamondbacks were responsible for all construction costs over $253 million. The extra expenses, combined with the Diamondbacks and the other expansion franchise, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, not being allowed to share in national MLB revenue for their first five years of operations, left the Diamondbacks in a less-than-desirable financial situation, which came back to haunt team founder and managing partner Jerry Colangelo and his group.

===Since 1996===
Construction on the park began in 1996, and was finished just before the Diamondbacks&#x27; first season, in 1998. It was the third MLB stadium to have a retractable roof and the first in the United States (at the time, only Toronto&#x27;s SkyDome (Rogers Centre) and Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium had them; others since are Daikin Park in Houston, American Family Field in Milwaukee, Globe Life Field in Arlington, T-Mobile Park in Seattle, and LoanDepot Park in Miami). It was also the first ballpark to feature natural grass in a retractable roof stadium.

The stadium hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 of the 2001 World Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees. The Diamondbacks won all four home games, winning the title in seven games, and thus denying the Yankees a fourth consecutive championship. It was only the third time that the home team won all games of a World Series, with the other two instances occurring in and , both by the Minnesota Twins.

In March 2006, Chase Field played host to three first-round games of the World Baseball Classic.

Chase Field hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2011.

Chase Field hosted the 2017 National League Wild Card Game between the Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies. This was the D-Backs&#x27; first appearance in the postseason as a Wild Card team. The D-Backs won 11–8 and advanced to the 2017 NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers but were swept in three games. Game 3 was held at Chase Field, when the D-Backs lost 3–1.
Chase Field has a swimming pool located in right-center field, which is rented to patrons as a suite holding 35 guests for $3,500 per game during the 2011 season. Mark Grace was the first player to hit a home run into the pool. Besides baseball, the pool has been used by Monster Jam&#x27;s Jim Koehler to continue his tradition of swimming after Freestyle. The pool which opened with the stadium in 1998, was redesigned in the offseason leading up to the 2005 season. 

The ballpark featured a dirt strip between home plate and the pitcher&#x27;s mound until 2019. This dirt strip, sometimes known as the &quot;keyhole&quot;, was very common in old-time ballparks up to 1938. The dirt strip was removed when synthetic turf was installed and since then, Comerica Park is the only park to have one.

The park&#x27;s foul territory is somewhat larger than that for most ballparks built in the 1990s. With 80% of the seats in foul territory, the upper deck is one of the highest in the majors. The park&#x27;s suites are tucked far under the third deck, which keeps the upper deck closer to the action, with the exception of the Dugout Suites which sit next to the home and visitor&#x27;s dugouts.

Before the 2008 season began, an HD scoreboard was installed beyond center field, replacing the original. The new scoreboard is high and wide and cost $14 million. It is the fifth-largest HD screen in Major League Baseball behind Kauffman Stadium. The screen at Kauffman is larger in area and is square but Chase Field&#x27;s screen is wider and rectangular.

Premium seating includes 4,400 club seats, 57 suites, 6 party suites, Executive suite, batters box suite, two dugout suites, and a swimming pool.

The Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals game on September 24, 2019, was the longest game in Chase Field&#x27;s history. It lasted six hours and 53 minutes, involving 19 innings.

On October 12, 2018, the Diamondbacks announced that they would replace their natural grass surface with a synthetic surface from Shaw Sports Turf for the 2019 season. In 2019, leaked images of a potential new stadium by architectural firm MEIS Architects were briefly online before being removed by the firm.

The stadium hosted the third, fourth and fifth games of the 2023 World Series between the Diamondbacks and the Texas Rangers.

===Naming rights===
The stadium was called Bank One Ballpark when Bank One of Chicago, Illinois (who had acquired locally based Valley National Bank of Arizona in 1992), purchased naming rights for $100 million over 30 years. After Bank One merged with New York-based JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. in 2005, Chase assumed the naming rights and the stadium&#x27;s name was changed to Chase Field.

==Other events==
The stadium hosts occasional concerts and international soccer games. For football and soccer, the field is set up with the end lines perpendicular to the third-base line and temporary bleachers added on the east side.

===International baseball tournaments===
Chase Field has hosted first-round games in the 2006 and 2013 World Baseball Classic tournaments, and hosted first round games in the 2023 tournament, from March 11, 2023, to March 15, 2023, which was postponed from 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===College sports===
The organizers of the Insight.com Bowl moved the game from Arizona Stadium in Tucson to Phoenix beginning in December 2000, and Chase Field became the game&#x27;s host. After hosting six editions of the game, the bowl game moved to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, to replace the Fiesta Bowl, which had moved to State Farm Stadium in Glendale. The bowl, which has undergone several naming changes, remained in Tempe for nine playings, then returned to Chase Field starting with the January 2016 edition. In October 2024, the game was renamed as the Rate Bowl due to a rebranding of the corporate sponsor.

Chase Field has staged nine women&#x27;s college basketball games. The second game, played on December 18, 2006, was shortened by rain with four minutes and 18 seconds remaining and Arizona State leading Texas Tech 61–45. Venue staff closed the roof in an effort to finish the game, but officials deemed the court unsafe. In 2000, ASU played the Tennessee Volunteers at the same facility.

In 2006, Chase Field was the site of an annual &quot;Challenge at Chase&quot;, a college baseball game between Arizona State and University of Arizona that lasted two years. The Arizona Wildcats won both contests in 2006 and 2007.

===Concerts===
===Bull riding===
In February 2006, the Professional Bull Riders hosted a Built Ford Tough Series bull riding event at this venue. Chris Shivers won this event with a total score of 181.5 points (out of a possible 200) on two bulls, including an impressive 93.75 (out of 100) points on Taylor Made bucking bull, Smokeless Wardance, in the short-go round. During the long-go round, the roof was closed, but during the short-go, the roof was opened.

===Supercross===
The stadium has hosted Monster Energy Supercross rounds from 1999 to 2015. Monster Jam came to Chase Field every year in late January about two weeks after Monster Energy Supercross. Both events moved to the University of Phoenix Stadium in 2016.

===Wrestling===
WWE hosted the Royal Rumble at Chase Field on January 27, 2019, marking nearly 16 years that a WWE event was held at a baseball stadium since WrestleMania XIX at Safeco Field in Seattle and the first Royal Rumble to be held outdoors.

===International women&#x27;s soccer===


==Roof and cooling system==

Chase Field&#x27;s roof is opened or closed depending on the game-time temperature. Even with the roof closed, the park&#x27;s windows allow enough sunlight to play in daylight without overheating the stadium. The roof takes about 4½ minutes to open or close at a cost of $2–$3.

While the ballpark had a grass surface, the roof would be kept open to expose the turf to sunlight. When necessary, it would be closed three hours before game time using two 200-horsepower motors triggered from a control room in the upper deck above left-center field. A massive HVAC system then dropped the temperature inside the park to about 78 °F (25.5 °C) by the time the gates opened. The chilled-water system, which has cooling power sufficient for 2,500 homes of , also serves more than 30 buildings in downtown Phoenix. The cooling plant, located in a separate building next to the ballpark, freezes water overnight to reduce daytime electricity demand. Originally, the HVAC system did not cool above row 25 of the upper level, exposing fans in the higher rows to the brunt of Phoenix&#x27; oppressive summer heat. Subsequent improvements kept virtually all of the facility in air-conditioned comfort.
 Following the introduction of a synthetic playing surface, the roof is kept mostly closed and is opened only on game days when weather permits, greatly reducing the facility&#x27;s demand on the HVAC system.

==Transportation==
Chase Field is served by westbound Valley Metro Light Rail&#x27;s Washington at 3rd Street station and eastbound Jefferson at 3rd Street station.

<text>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a detective novel by the British writer Agatha Christie, her third to feature Hercule Poirot as the lead detective. The novel was published in the UK in June 1926 by William Collins, Sons, having previously been serialised as &quot;Who Killed Ackroyd?&quot; between July and September 1925 in the &quot;London Evening News&quot;. An American edition by Dodd, Mead and Company followed in 1926.

The novel was well received from its first publication, and has been called Christie&#x27;s masterpiece. In 2013, the British Crime Writers&#x27; Association voted it the best crime novel ever. It is one of Christie&#x27;s best-known and most controversial novels, its innovative twist ending having a significant impact on the genre. Howard Haycraft included it in his list of the most influential crime novels ever written.

==Plot==
Dr James Sheppard, the story&#x27;s narrator, lives with his unmarried sister, Caroline, in the English country village of King’s Abbot. Telling the story in his own words, Dr Sheppard recounts being called to certify the death of a wealthy widow, Mrs Ferrars, who has committed suicide a year after her abusive husband&#x27;s demise. Caroline speculates that Mrs Ferrars had poisoned her husband and has committed suicide out of remorse.

Roger Ackroyd, wealthy widower and owner of Fernly Park, tells Dr Sheppard that he needs to talk to him urgently and invites him to dinner that evening. In addition to Dr Sheppard, the dinner guests include Major Blunt, Ackroyd&#x27;s sister-in-law Mrs Cecil Ackroyd, her daughter Flora, and Ackroyd&#x27;s personal secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. Flora tells the doctor that she is engaged to Ralph Paton, Ackroyd&#x27;s stepson, though the engagement is being kept confidential.

In his study after dinner, Ackroyd tells Dr Sheppard that he had been engaged to Mrs Ferrars for several months, and that she had admitted the day before that she had indeed poisoned her husband. She was being blackmailed, and promised to reveal the blackmailer&#x27;s name within 24 hours. At this point Ackroyd&#x27;s butler, Parker, enters with a letter that Mrs Ferrars had posted just before she killed herself. Ackroyd apologetically asks Dr Sheppard to leave so that he can read it alone.

Shortly after arriving back home, the doctor receives a phone call. Dr Sheppard tells Caroline that Ackroyd has been found dead and then returns to Fernly Park. Parker professes to know nothing about the phone call. Unable to get a response at the study door, Sheppard and Parker break it down and find Ackroyd dead in his chair, killed with his own dagger. The letter is missing and footprints are found leading in and out of the study through an open window.

Ralph disappears and becomes the primary suspect when the footprints are found to match shoes that he owns. Flora, convinced that Ralph is innocent, asks the recently retired detective Hercule Poirot to investigate. He agrees and visits the scene of the crime, asking Dr Sheppard to accompany him.

Parker notes to Poirot that a chair in Ackroyd&#x27;s study has been moved. Poirot questions the guests and staff, including Ursula Bourne, the parlourmaid, who has no alibi. The window of opportunity for the murderer after Dr Sheppard&#x27;s departure appears to have been quite short since Raymond and Blunt later heard Ackroyd talking in his study, and Flora says she saw him just before going up to bed.

Poirot unravels a complex web of intrigue, and presents the missing Ralph Paton – who was, it transpires, already secretly married to Ursula when Ackroyd had decided that he should marry Flora. The pair had arranged a clandestine meeting in the garden. Flora is forced to admit she never in fact saw her uncle after dinner, leaving Raymond and Blunt as the last people to hear Ackroyd alive. Blunt confesses his love for Flora.

Alone with Dr Sheppard, Poirot reveals he knows that Dr Sheppard himself is both Ferrars&#x27; blackmailer and Ackroyd&#x27;s killer. Realising that Mrs Ferrars&#x27;s letter would implicate him, Sheppard had stabbed Ackroyd before leaving the study. He left publicly through the front door, then put Ralph&#x27;s shoes on, ran round to the study window and climbed back in. Locking the door from the inside, he set a desk dictaphone going, playing a recording of Ackroyd&#x27;s voice, and pulled out a chair to hide it from the sightline of anyone standing in the doorway. To provide the excuse for returning to Fernly Park, he had asked a patient to call him at home. While Sheppard had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered, he slipped the dictaphone into his medical bag, and put the chair back in place. These details were concealed from his narrative, which has also now been given to Poirot.

Poirot tells Dr Sheppard the matter will be reported to the police in the morning and suggests he spare his sister Caroline by taking his own life. Sheppard completes his account of Poirot&#x27;s investigation – the novel itself – with the final chapter, &quot;Apologia&quot;, serving as his suicide note.

==Narrative voice and structure==

The novel is narrated by Dr James Sheppard, who becomes Poirot&#x27;s assistant, in place of Captain Hastings who has married and settled in the Argentine. It includes an unexpected plot twist towards the end, when Dr Sheppard reveals he has throughout been an unreliable narrator, using literary techniques to conceal his guilt without writing anything untrue (e.g., &quot;I did what little had to be done&quot; at the point where he slipped the dictaphone into his bag and moved the chair).

==Literary significance and reception==
The review in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; began, &quot;This is a well-written detective story of which the only criticism might perhaps be that there are too many curious incidents not really connected with the crime which have to be elucidated before the true criminal can be discovered&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;It is all very puzzling, but the great Hercule Poirot, a retired Belgian detective, solves the mystery. It may safely be asserted that very few readers will do so.&quot;

A long review in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, read in part:
&quot;The Observer&quot; had high praise for the novel, especially the character Caroline:
No one is more adroit than Miss Christie in the manipulation of false clues and irrelevances and red herrings; and &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; makes breathless reading from first to the unexpected last. It is unfortunate that in two important points – the nature of the solution and the use of the telephone – Miss Christie has been anticipated by another recent novel: the truth is that this particular field is getting so well ploughed that it is hard to find a virgin patch anywhere. But Miss Christie&#x27;s story is distinguished from most of its class by its coherence, its reasonableness, and the fact that the characters live and move and have their being: the gossip-loving Caroline would be an acquisition to any novel.

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; found the plot to be clever and original:
When in the last dozen pages of Miss Christie&#x27;s detective novel, the answer comes to the question, &quot;Who killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot; the reader will feel that he has been fairly, or unfairly, sold up. Up till then he has been kept balancing in his mind from chapter to chapter the probabilities for or against the eight or nine persons at whom suspicion points... Everybody in the story appears to have a secret of his or her own hidden up the sleeve, the production of which is imperative in fitting into place the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle; and in the end it turns out that the Doctor himself is responsible for the largest bit of reticence. The tale may be recommended as one of the cleverest and most original of its kind.

Howard Haycraft, in his 1941 work, &quot;Murder for Pleasure&quot;, included the novel in his &quot;cornerstones&quot; list of the most influential crime novels ever written.

The English crime writer and critic Robert Barnard, in &quot;A Talent to Deceive: An appreciation of Agatha Christie&quot;, wrote that this novel is &quot;Apart—and it is an enormous &#x27;apart&#x27;—from the sensational solution, this is a fairly conventional Christie.&quot; He concluded that this is &quot;A classic, but there are some better [novels by] Christie.&quot;

John Goddard wrote an analysis of whether Christie &#x27;cheats&#x27; with her sensational solution and concluded that the charge of cheating fails.

In a biography of Christie, Laura Thompson wrote that this is the ultimate detective novel:
&quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; is the supreme, the ultimate detective novel. It rests upon the most elegant of all twists, the narrator who is revealed to be the murderer. This twist is not merely a function of plot: it puts the whole concept of detective fiction on an armature and sculpts it into a dazzling new shape. It was not an entirely new idea ... nor was it entirely her own idea ... but here, she realised, was an idea worth having. And only she could have pulled it off so completely. Only she had the requisite control, the willingness to absent herself from the authorial scene and let her plot shine clear.

In 1944–1946, the American literary critic Edmund Wilson attacked the entire mystery genre in a set of three columns in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The second, in the 20 January 1945 issue, was titled &quot;Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;, though he does no analysis of the novel. He dislikes mystery stories altogether, and chose the famous novel as the title of his piece.

In 1990, &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; came in at fifth place in The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time, a ranking by the members (all crime writers) of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association in Britain. A similar ranking was made in 1995 by the Mystery Writers of America, putting this novel in twelfth place.

Literature professor and author Pierre Bayard, in the 1998 work &quot;Qui a tué Roger Ackroyd?&quot; (&quot;Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?&quot;), re-investigates Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Ackroyd&quot;, proposing an alternative solution in another crime novel. He argues in favour of a different murderer – Sheppard&#x27;s sister, Caroline – and says Christie subconsciously knew who the real culprit is.

In 1999 the novel was included in Le Monde&#x27;s 100 Books of the Century published in the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;, chosen by readers from a list of 200.

In 2013, the Crime Writers&#x27; Association voted this novel as CWA Best Ever Novel. The 600 members of CWA said it was &quot;the finest example of the genre ever penned.&quot; It is a cornerstone of crime fiction, which &quot;contains one of the most celebrated plot twists in crime writing history.&quot; The poll taken on the 60th anniversary of CWA also honoured Agatha Christie as the best crime novel author ever.

In the &quot;Binge!&quot; article of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Issue #1343–44 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers picked &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; as an &quot;EW and Christie favorite&quot; on the list of the &quot;Nine Great Christie Novels&quot;.

The character of Caroline Sheppard was later acknowledged by Christie as a possible precursor to her famous detective Miss Marple.

==Development==

Christie revealed in her 1977 autobiography that the basic idea of the novel was given to her by her brother-in-law, James Watts of Abney Hall, who suggested a novel in which the criminal would be a Dr Watson character, which Christie considered to be a &quot;remarkably original thought&quot;.

In March 1924 Christie also received an unsolicited letter from Lord Louis Mountbatten. He had been impressed with her previous works and wrote, courtesy of &quot;The Sketch&quot; magazine (publishers of many of her short stories at that time) with an idea and notes for a story whose basic premise mirrored the Watts suggestion. Christie acknowledged the letter and after some thought, began to write the book but to a plot line of her invention. She also acknowledged taking inspiration from the infamous case of the unsolved death of Charles Bravo, who she thought had been murdered by Dr James Manby Gully.

In December 1969 Mountbatten wrote to Christie again after having seen a performance of &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. He mentioned his letter of the 1920s, and Christie replied, acknowledging the part he played in the conception of the book.

==Publication history==

The story first appeared as a fifty-four part serialisation in the &quot;London Evening News&quot; from Thursday, 16 July, to Wednesday, 16 September 1925 under the title &quot;Who Killed Ackroyd?&quot; In the United States, the story was serialised in four parts in &quot;Flynn&#x27;s Detective Weekly&quot; from 19 June (Volume 16, Number 2) to 10 July 1926 (Volume 16, Number 5). The text was heavily abridged and each instalment carried an uncredited illustration.

The Collins first edition of June 1926 (retailing for seven shillings and sixpence) was Christie&#x27;s first work placed with that publisher. &quot;The first book that Agatha wrote for Collins was the one that changed her reputation forever; no doubt she knew, as through 1925 she turned the idea over in her mind, that here she had a winner.&quot; The first United States publisher was The Dodd Mead and Company (New York), 19 June 1926 (retailing at $2.00).

By 1928, &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; was available in braille through the UK&#x27;s Royal National Institute for the Blind and was among the first works to be chosen for transfer to Gramophone record for their Books for the Blind library in the autumn of 1935. By 1936 it was listed as one of only eight books available in this form.

===Book dedication===

Christie&#x27;s dedication in the book reads &quot;To Punkie, who likes an orthodox detective story, murder, inquest, and suspicion falling on every one in turn!&quot;

&quot;Punkie&quot; was the family nickname of Christie&#x27;s sister and eldest sibling, Margaret (&quot;Madge&quot;) Frary Watts (1879–1950). Despite their eleven-year age gap, the sisters remained close throughout their lives. Christie&#x27;s mother first suggested to her that she should alleviate the boredom of an illness by writing a story. But soon after, when the sisters had been discussing the recently published classic detective story by Gaston Leroux, &quot;The Mystery of the Yellow Room&quot; (1908), Christie said she would like to try writing such a story. Margaret challenged her, saying that she would not be able to do it. In 1916, eight years later, Christie remembered this conversation and was inspired to write her first novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;.

Margaret Watts wrote a play, &quot;The Claimant&quot;, based on the Tichborne Case, which enjoyed a short run in the West End at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre from 11 September to 18 October 1924, two years before the book publication of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;.

===Dustjacket blurb===
The dustjacket blurb read as follows:
M. Poirot, the hero of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Stiles&quot; and other brilliant pieces of detective deduction, comes out of his temporary retirement like a giant refreshed, to undertake the investigation of a peculiarly brutal and mysterious murder. Geniuses like Sherlock Holmes often find a use for faithful mediocrities like Dr Watson, and by a coincidence it is the local doctor who follows Poirot round, and himself tells the story. Furthermore, as seldom happens in these cases, he is instrumental in giving Poirot one of the most valuable clues to the mystery.

==In popular culture==
*Gilbert Adair&#x27;s 2006 locked-room mystery &quot;The Act of Roger Murgatroyd&quot; was written as &quot;a celebration-cum-critique-cum-parody&quot; of &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;.

==Adaptations==

===Stage play===
====&quot;Alibi&quot;====

The book formed the basis of the earliest adaptation of any work of Christie&#x27;s when the play, &quot;Alibi&quot;, adapted by Michael Morton, opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London on 15 May 1928. It ran for 250 performances with Charles Laughton as Poirot. Laughton also starred in the Broadway run of the play, retitled &quot;The Fatal Alibi,&quot; which opened at the Booth Theatre on 8 February 1932. The American production was not as successful and closed after just 24 performances. 
&quot;Alibi&quot; inspired Christie to write her first stage play, &quot;Black Coffee&quot;. Christie, with her dog Peter, attended the rehearsals of &quot;Alibi&quot; and found its &quot;novelty&quot; enjoyable. However, &quot;she was sufficiently irritated by the changes to the original to want to write a play of her own.&quot;

====&quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;====

In 2023, the novel was adapted for the stage by Edgar award nominated playwright Mark Shanahan in partnership with Agatha Christie, Ltd. The play received its first public reading at the Westport Country Playhouse in June 2023 with Santino Fontana as Dr. Sheppard and Arnie Burton as Poirot. Shortly thereafter, the world premiere production directed by Mark Shanahan opened at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas and featured the Alley&#x27;s resident company of actors with David Sinaiko as Poirot. The Houston Chronicle reviewed the play, calling it &quot;a whodunnit done right. This world premiere adaptation elegantly transfers Christie’s rich mystery from the page to the stage...&quot;
The play opened on 21 July and ran through 27 August in a limited run as part of the Alley Theatre&#x27;s Summer Chills series and was subsequently published by Concord Theatricals before receiving numerous productions. The adaptation remains mostly faithful to the book, with Shanahan stating that crafting the adaptation was a &quot;labour of love.&quot;

===Film===

The play was turned into the first sound film based on a Christie work. Running 75 minutes, it was released on 28 April 1931, by Twickenham Film Studios and produced by Julius S. Hagan. Austin Trevor played Poirot, a role he reprised later that year in the film adaptation of Christie&#x27;s 1930 play, &quot;Black Coffee&quot;. &quot;Alibi&quot; is considered to be a lost film.

===Radio ===

Orson Welles adapted the novel as a one-hour radio play for the 12 November 1939 episode of &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. Welles played both Dr Sheppard and Hercule Poirot. The play was adapted by Herman J. Mankiewicz, produced by Welles and John Houseman, and directed by Welles.

<doc id="243074" wikidata="Q190143" url="?curid=243074" title="Malic acid">
<text>Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula . It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (- and -enantiomers), though only the -isomer exists naturally. The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is a metabolic intermediate in the citric acid cycle.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;malic&#x27; is derived from Latin , meaning &#x27;apple&#x27;. The related Latin word , meaning &#x27;apple tree&#x27;, is used as the name of the genus &quot;Malus&quot;, which includes all apples and crabapples; and is the origin of other taxonomic classifications such as Maloideae, Malinae, and Maleae.

==Biochemistry==
-Malic acid is the naturally occurring form, whereas a mixture of - and -malic acid is produced synthetically.

Malate plays an important role in biochemistry. In the C4 carbon fixation process, malate is a source of CO2 in the Calvin cycle. In the citric acid cycle, (&quot;S&quot;)-malate is an intermediate, formed by the addition of an -OH group on the &quot;si&quot; face of fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate via anaplerotic reactions.

Malate is also synthesized by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in the guard cells of plant leaves. Malate, as a double anion, often accompanies potassium cations during the uptake of solutes into the guard cells in order to maintain electrical balance in the cell. The accumulation of these solutes within the guard cell decreases the solute potential, allowing water to enter the cell and promote aperture of the stomata.

==In food==
Malic acid was first isolated from apple juice by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1785. Antoine Lavoisier in 1787 proposed the name &quot;&quot;, which is derived from the Latin word for apple, &quot;&quot;—as is its genus name &quot;Malus&quot;.
In German it is named &quot;Äpfelsäure&quot; (or &quot;Apfelsäure&quot;) after plural or singular of a sour thing from the apple fruit, but the salt(s) are called &quot;Malat(e)&quot;.
Malic acid is the main acid in many fruits, including apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, mirabelles, peaches, pears, plums, and quince, and is present in lower concentrations in other fruits, such as citrus. It contributes to the sourness of unripe apples. Sour apples contain high proportions of the acid. It is present in grapes and in most wines with concentrations sometimes as high as 5 g/L. It confers a tart taste to wine; the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. The taste of malic acid is very clear and pure in rhubarb, a plant for which it is the primary flavor. It is also the compound responsible for the tart flavor of sumac spice. It is also a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as &quot;salt and vinegar&quot; flavored potato chips.

The process of malolactic fermentation converts malic acid to much milder lactic acid. Malic acid occurs naturally in all fruits and many vegetables, and is generated in fruit metabolism.

Malic acid, when added to food products, is denoted by E number E296. It is sometimes used with or in place of the less sour citric acid in sour sweets. These sweets are sometimes labeled with a warning stating that excessive consumption can cause irritation of the mouth. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed by its INS number 296).

Malic acid contains 10 kJ (2.39 kilocalories) of energy per gram.

==Production and main reactions==
Racemic malic acid is produced industrially by the double hydration of maleic anhydride. In 2000, American production capacity was 5,000 tons per year. The enantiomers may be separated by chiral resolution of the racemic mixture. &quot;S&quot;-Malic acid is obtained by fermentation of fumaric acid.

Self-condensation of malic acid in the presence of fuming sulfuric acid gives the pyrone coumalic acid:
Carbon monoxide and water are liberated during this reaction.

Malic acid was important in the discovery of the Walden inversion and the Walden cycle, in which (−)-malic acid first is converted into (+)-chlorosuccinic acid by action of phosphorus pentachloride. Wet silver oxide then converts the chlorine compound to (+)-malic acid, which then reacts with PCl5 to the (−)-chlorosuccinic acid. The cycle is completed when silver oxide takes this compound back to (−)-malic acid.

-malic acid is used to resolve α-phenylethylamine, a versatile resolving agent in its own right.

==Plant defense==
Soil supplementation with molasses increases microbial synthesis of malic acid. This is thought to occur naturally as part of soil microbe suppression of disease, so soil amendment with molasses can be used as a crop treatment in horticulture.

<doc id="243087" wikidata="Q727861" url="?curid=243087" title="The A.B.C. Murders">
<text>The A.B.C. Murders is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, featuring her characters Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp, as they contend with a series of killings by a mysterious murderer known only as &quot;A.B.C.&quot;. The book was first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 6 January 1936, sold for seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) while a US edition, published by Dodd, Mead and Company on 14 February of the same year, was priced $2.00.

The form of the novel is unusual, combining first-person narrative and third-person narrative. This approach was previously used by Agatha Christie in &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot;. In &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; the third-person narrative is supposedly reconstructed by the first-person narrator of the story, Arthur Hastings.

The initial premise is that a serial killer is murdering people with alliterative names. The murders follow an alphabetical order, starting with a victim whose initials were A. A., and appear to lack a motive.

The novel was well received in the UK and the US when it was published. One reviewer said it was &quot;a baffler of the first water&quot;, while another remarked on Christie&#x27;s ingenuity in the plot. A reviewer in 1990 said it was &quot;a classic, still fresh story, beautifully worked out&quot;.

==Plot==
Returning from South America, Arthur Hastings meets with his old friend, Hercule Poirot, at his new flat in London. Poirot shows him a mysterious letter he has received, signed &quot;A.B.C.&quot;, that details a crime that is to be committed very soon, which he suspects will be a murder. Two more letters of the same nature soon arrive at his flat, each before a murder being carried out by A.B.C., and committed in alphabetical order: Alice Ascher, killed in her tobacco shop in Andover; Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Barnard, a flirty waitress killed on the beach at Bexhill; and Sir Carmichael Clarke, a wealthy man, killed at his home in Churston. In each murder, an &quot;ABC Rail Guide&quot; is left beside the victim.

The police team for the investigation, led by Chief Inspector Japp, includes Inspector Crome, who doubts Poirot&#x27;s detective abilities, and Dr. Thompson, who tries to profile the killer. Poirot forms a &quot;Legion&quot; of relatives of the deceased to uncover new information: Franklin Clarke, Sir Carmichael&#x27;s brother; Mary Drower, Ascher&#x27;s niece; Donald Fraser, Betty&#x27;s fiancé; Megan Barnard, Betty&#x27;s elder sister, and Thora Grey, Sir Carmichael&#x27;s young assistant. Following a meeting with the third victim&#x27;s widow, Lady Clarke, one key similarity between the murders is established – on the day of each murder, a man selling silk stockings has appeared at or near each crime scene. Despite this information, Poirot wonders why the letters were sent to him, rather than the police or the newspapers, and why the third letter misspelled Poirot&#x27;s address, causing a delay in his receipt of it. Soon, A.B.C. sends his next letter, directing everybody to Doncaster, where it is suspected that the next murder will occur at the St. Leger Stakes race meeting that day. However, the murderer strikes at a cinema instead, and the victim&#x27;s name does not match the alphabetical pattern of the other killings.

The police soon get a tip-off about the man linked to the murders – Alexander Bonaparte Cust, an epileptic travelling salesman, who suffers from memory blackouts and constant agonising headaches as the result of a head injury during the First World War. Cust flees his apartment but collapses upon arriving at the Andover police station, where he is taken into custody. Apart from claiming that a stocking firm hired him, he lacks any memory of committing the murders but believes he must be guilty of them – he had been at the cinema when the last murder occurred and found blood on his sleeve and a knife in his pocket after he had left. The police learn that the firm in question never hired Cust. Their search of his room turns up an unopened box of ABC railway guides and the typewriter and fine paper used in A.B.C.&#x27;s letters, while the knife is discovered in the hallway outside his room where he dropped it. Poirot doubts Cust&#x27;s guilt because of his memory blackouts, and especially because he had a solid alibi for the Bexhill murder.

Calling a Legion meeting, Poirot proclaims Cust&#x27;s innocence, and exposes Franklin Clarke as the A.B.C. murderer. His motive was simple: Lady Clarke is slowly dying from cancer, and upon her death, Carmichael would probably marry his assistant. Franklin feared a possible second marriage, as he wants all of his brother&#x27;s wealth, so he chose to murder his brother while Lady Clarke was still alive. A chance encounter with Cust at a pub gave Franklin the idea for the murder plot – he would disguise his crime as part of a serial killing. Having created the letters Poirot would receive, Franklin set up Cust with his job, giving him the typewriter and other items Franklin would use to frame him for the murders. A suggestion by Hastings makes clear that the third letter was misaddressed intentionally because Franklin wanted no chance of the police interrupting that murder. Franklin then followed Cust to the cinema, committed the last murder, and planted the knife on him as he left.

Franklin laughs off Poirot&#x27;s theory but panics when he is told that his fingerprint has been found on Cust&#x27;s typewriter key and that Milly Higley, a co-worker of Betty Barnard, saw him in her company. Franklin attempts to end his life with his own gun, only to find that Poirot has emptied it with the help of a pickpocket. With the case solved, Poirot pairs off Donald with Megan. Later, Cust tells Poirot that the press has made him an offer for his story; Poirot suggests that he demand a higher price for it and that his headaches may have arisen from his poorly fitted spectacles. Once alone, Poirot tells Hastings that the claim of the fingerprint on the typewriter was a bluff but is pleased that the pair &quot;went hunting once more&quot;.

==Characters==
* Hercule Poirot – Renowned Belgian detective, involved in investigating the serial killings by A.B.C., due to letters received from him.
* Captain Arthur Hastings – Poirot&#x27;s old friend and companion on the case. He is also the narrator of the novel.
* Inspector Japp – Poirot&#x27;s old friend in Scotland Yard, and the chief investigating officer into the serial killings.
* Inspector Crome – Part of Japp&#x27;s police team investigating the murders. Initially in charge of the Bexhill murder, and maintains a low opinion of Poirot.
* Dr Thompson – Forensic psychologist, assigned to Japp&#x27;s police team. Focuses on making a profile of the killer.
* A.B.C. – The unknown, cold-blooded serial killer of the case. His pattern of murders is done in alphabetical order, with his calling card being an ABC railway guide left at each crime scene.
* Alice Ascher – A.B.C.&#x27;s first victim. An elderly woman with no children, and the owner of a tobacco shop in Andover.
* Betty Barnard – A.B.C.&#x27;s second victim. A young, flirtatious part-time waitress in Bexhill.

==Literary significance and reception==
The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; on 11 January 1936 concluded, with a note of admiration for the plot that, &quot;If Mrs Christie ever deserts fiction for crime, she will be very dangerous: no one but Poirot will catch her.&quot;

Isaac Anderson in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; of 16 February 1936 finished his review by writing, &quot;This story is a baffler of the first water, written in Agatha Christie&#x27;s best manner. It seems to us the very best thing she has done, not even excepting &quot;Roger Ackroyd&quot;.&quot;

In &quot;The Observer&quot;″s issue of 5 January 1936, &quot;Torquemada&quot; (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote, &quot;Ingenuity ... is a mild term for Mrs Christie&#x27;s gift. In &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;, rightly chosen by the [crime] club as its book of the month, she has quite altered her method of attack upon the reader, and yet the truth behind this fantastic series of killings is as fairly elusive as any previous truth which Poirot has had to capture for us. The reader adopts two quite different mental attitudes as he reads. At first, and for a great many pages, he is asking himself: &quot;Is Agatha Christie going to let me down? Does she think she can give us this kind of tale as a detective story and get away with it?&quot; Then the conviction comes to him that he has been wronging the authoress, and that he alone is beginning to see through her artifice. In the last chapter he finds, because brilliant circus work with a troop of red horses and one dark herring has diverted his attention from a calm consideration of motive, he has not been wronging, but merely wrong. It is noticeable, by the way, that characters break off at intervals to tell us that we have to do with &quot;a homicidal murderer&quot;. We are ready to take this for granted until Mrs Christie (I wouldn&#x27;t put it past her) gives us one who isn&#x27;t.&quot;

E R Punshon reviewed the novel in 1936, writing that &quot;Some readers are drawn to the detective novel by the sheer interest of watching and perhaps anticipating the logical development of a given theme, others take their pleasure in following the swift succession of events in an exciting story, and yet others find themselves chiefly interested in the psychological reactions caused by crime impinging upon the routine of ordinary life. Skilful and happy is that author who can weave into a unity this triple thread. In Mrs Agatha Christie&#x27;s new book...the task is attempted with success.&quot; He added, &quot;In the second chapter, Mrs Christie shows us what seems to be the maniac himself. But the wise reader, remembering other tales of Mrs Christie&#x27;s, will murmur to himself &#x27;I trust her not; odds on she is fooling me,&#x27; and so will continue to a climax it is not &#x27;odds on&#x27; but a dead cert he will not have guessed. To an easy and attractive style and an adequate if not very profound sense of character Mrs Christie adds an extreme and astonishing ingenuity, nor does it very greatly matter that it is quite impossible to accept the groundwork of her tale or to suppose that any stalking-horse would behave so invariably so exactly as required. As at Bexhill, a hitch would always occur. In the smooth and apparently effortless perfection with which she achieves her ends Mrs. Christie reminds one of Noël Coward; she might, indeed, in that respect be called the Noël Coward of the detective novel.&quot;

An unnamed reviewer in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of 16 January 1936 said, &quot;I&#x27;m thanking heaven I&#x27;ve got a name that begins with a letter near the end of the alphabet! That&#x27;s just in case some imitative soul uses this book as a text book for some nice little series of murders.&quot; They summed up, &quot;It&#x27;s Agatha Christie at her best.&quot;

Robert Barnard reviewed this novel favorably, calling it &quot;A classic, still fresh story, beautifully worked out.&quot; He noted that the plot &quot;differs from the usual pattern in that we &quot;seem&quot; to be involved in a chase: the series of murders &quot;appears&quot; to be the work of a maniac. In fact the solution reasserts the classic pattern of a closed circle of suspects, with a logical, well-motivated murder plan. The English detective story cannot embrace the irrational, it seems.&quot; His final judgment on this novel is that it was &quot;a total success – but thank God she didn&#x27;t try taking it through to Z&quot;.

In the &quot;Binge!&quot; article of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; issue #1343–44 (26 December 2014 – 3 January 2015), the writers picked &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; as an &quot;EW favorite&quot; on the list of the &quot;Nine Great Christie Novels&quot;.

==References to other works==
In Chapter 1, Poirot alludes to a situation in the 1935 novel, &quot;Three Act Tragedy&quot;. In the same chapter, Poirot mentions his failed attempt at retirement to grow vegetable marrows as depicted in &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;.

In Chapter 3, an exchange between Japp and Poirot shows that, in 1935, Christie was already thinking about Poirot&#x27;s death as later narrated in &quot;Curtain&quot;: &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t wonder if you ended by detecting your own death,&quot; said Japp, laughing heartily. &quot;That&#x27;s an idea, that is. Ought to be put in a book.&quot; &quot;It will be Hastings who will have to do that,&quot; said Poirot, twinkling at me. &quot;Ha ha! That would be a joke, that would,&quot; laughed Japp.&quot;

Still in Chapter 3, Poirot lays out the plot of what he considers a perfect crime, a crime so challenging that &quot;even he&quot; would find it hard to solve. This exact murder – where someone is murdered by one of four people playing bridge in the same room with him – is the subject of Christie&#x27;s &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;, which was published later in the same year and which, in turn, features Hercule Poirot and has another character refer to him as the man who solved the ABC murders.

In Chapter 19, Poirot reflects over his first case in England, where he &quot;brought together two people who loved one another by the simple method of having one of them arrested for murder&quot;. This is a reference to the novel &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;, and the lovers mentioned are John and Mary Cavendish.

==References in other works==
The plot of &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; is mentioned by Detective Inspector John Appleby in Michael Innes′ novel &quot;Appleby&#x27;s End&quot; (1945).

Chapters 393–397 of Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s manga &quot;Detective Conan&quot; feature a case with some similarities as the criminal was inspired by the plot of &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;. Episodes 325–327 of its anime adaptation also featured the incident. The 1998 anime film &quot;Case Closed: The Fourteenth Target&quot; is a combination of this story, with a murderer killing based on numbers in names as a ruse to confuse detectives, while also incorporating Christie&#x27;s &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;.

A Bengali detective novel of Narayan Sanyal &#x27;&quot;O Aa Ka Khuner Kanta&quot;&#x27; was based on &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;. Sanyal admitted the inspiration from Christie&#x27;s novel in the introduction to the book. Here the character P. K. Basu, Bar-at-law, has the role of main protagonist, similar to Poirot.

==Film, TV and other adaptations==

===Film===
The first adaptation of the novel was the 1965 film &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot; with Tony Randall as Hercule Poirot, a version far more comic than mysterious.

The story of the 2012 Malayalam film &quot;Grandmaster&quot; written by director B. Unnikrishnan draws inspirations from &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;. The characterisation of Chandrasekhar in the movie as played by the Indian movie veteran Mohanlal, while inspired by that of the legendary Hercule Poirot, has more to do with the popular established screen persona of Mohanlal in Malayalam.

In fact, B. Unnikrishnan himself had penned a more fleshed-out script themed on the ABC murders for an investigative television series named &quot;Black and White (Season 2)&quot;, starring actor Siddique in the role of the investigator, which aired around 2004 on Asianet.

===Radio===
The BBC Radio adaptation &quot;Poirot – The ABC Murders&quot; starring John Moffatt and Simon Williams was first broadcast in 2000. The show is periodically rebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

The 18 May 1943 episode of &quot;Suspense&quot; was an adaptation of The ABC Murders, starring Charles Laughton.

===Television===
;&quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; (1992)
In 1992, the novel was adapted for television as part of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, and was first aired in the UK on 5 January 1992. It stars David Suchet as Hercule Poirot, Hugh Fraser as Captain Hastings, and Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector Japp, with its guest stars including Donald Sumpter as Alexander Bonaparte Cust, Donald Douglas as Franklin Clarke, Nicholas Farrell as Donald Fraser, and Pippa Guard as Megan Barnard.

The adaptation, while mostly faithful to the novel&#x27;s plot, has a number of minor changes:

* The characters of Inspector Crome, Dr Thompson, Lily Marbury and Tom Hartigan are omitted.
* Police are alerted to Cust&#x27;s suspected involvement with the murders through his landlady, while the knife used in the fourth murder is found in his room.
* Franklin Clarke attempts to escape when he is exposed by Poirot as the killer.

;&quot;Meitantei Akafuji Takashi&quot; (2005)
This Japanese adaptation aired as the first night of a two-night release in December 2005. The second night was an adaptation of &quot;The Murder on the Links&quot;. The show stars Shirō Itō as Takashi Akafuji, who represents the character of Poirot.

;&quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot; (2009)
The first aired episode of the French television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot; was an adaptation of &quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;. The episode aired in January 2009.

;BBC&#x27;s &quot;The ABC Murders&quot; (2018)

In 2018, an adaptation of the novel, written by Sarah Phelps, was filmed for the BBC. It was aired as a three-part miniseries over three consecutive days from 26 December that year. It stars John Malkovich as Hercule Poirot and Rupert Grint as Inspector Crome, with guest stars including Eamon Farren as Alexander Bonaparte Cust, Jack Farthing as Donald Fraser, Freya Mavor as Thora Grey, Kevin McNally as Inspector Japp, and Anya Chalotra as Lily Marbury.

This adaptation only loosely follows the novel&#x27;s plot, and features considerable changes to both story and character:

* Captain Hastings is omitted from the plot.
* Japp dies from a heart attack at the start, leaving the investigation to be solely conducted by Inspector Crome.
* Poirot&#x27;s background is explored prior to the outbreak of the First World War; in this adaptation, he was a priest before the conflict rather than a detective in the Belgian police force.
* The first three murders are committed in locations that have some relevance to Poirot; he helped deliver a baby when on a refugee train that stopped in Andover, visited the café where Betty Barnard would later work on a visit to Bexhill, and attended a party at the Clarke house. 
* More care is taken in planning the D murder; rather than just stabbing a person in a cinema, reasoning that someone with a suitable name would be nearby, the killer intends to murder a ventriloquist at a theatre, but kills another performer on the theatre bill.
* A fifth murder is conducted pertaining to the letter E and Cust is present at the scene. The killer is surprised by this and takes this opportunity to implicate Cust by planting the weapon when Cust has a fit.
* Cust is pursued by police shortly after murder E. He is caught after he injures himself, rather than passing out at a police station.
* There is no reference to Mary Drower, Alice Ascher&#x27;s niece, within the plot. Thora Grey&#x27;s character is changed to being manipulated into being Franklin&#x27;s accomplice by establishing an alibi for him in one of the murders. 
* Franklin claims, prior to his execution, that he committed the crimes to give Poirot a new cause to live for, considering them friends, although Poirot has nothing but disdain for the man&#x27;s methods.

===Anime===
A four-part episode of the anime &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Great Detectives: Poirot and Marple&quot; is based on the book.

&quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot; are also an arc of the anime &quot;Hyouka&quot;, or episode 15 &quot;The Jūmonji Case&quot; of the Hyouka video series.

===Manga===
&#x27;ABC Satsujin Jiken&#x27; (ABC殺人事件, The ABC Murders) is a two-volume manga by Yasushi Hoshino, set in Japan, loosely based on a mixture of the original novel and &quot;Murder in the Mews&quot;. Poirot retains his iconic appearance, though is renamed Eikubo, while Hastings is renamed Asakura.

===Video games===
In 2009, DreamCatcher Interactive released a video game version of the novel for the Nintendo DS titled &quot;Agatha Christie: The ABC Murders&quot;. The game has players control Captain Hastings and must solve the mystery by inspecting crime scenes and questioning suspects. To appeal to players familiar with the original story, the game also offers the option to play with a different murderer, which results in different clues and testimony throughout the entire game. The game received mediocre reviews, but was commended for its faithful recreation of the source material.

In 2016, a game titled &quot;Agatha Christie: The ABC Murders&quot; was released by Microids for PC, PS4 and Xbox One.

The UK serialisation was in 16 parts in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; from Monday 28 November to Thursday 12 December 1935. All the instalments carried an illustration by Steven Spurrier. This version did not contain any chapter divisions and totally omitted the foreword as well as chapters 26, 32 and 35; in addition, most of chapters seven and 20 were missing. Combined with other abridgements, this serialisation omitted almost 40% of the text of the published novel.

<text>In computer science, a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This property is used to determine the usefulness of greedy algorithms for a problem. 

Typically, a greedy algorithm is used to solve a problem with optimal substructure if it can be proven by induction that this is optimal at each step. Otherwise, provided the problem exhibits overlapping subproblems as well, divide-and-conquer methods or dynamic programming may be used. If there are no appropriate greedy algorithms and the problem fails to exhibit overlapping subproblems, often a lengthy but straightforward search of the solution space is the best alternative.

In the application of dynamic programming to mathematical optimization, Richard Bellman&#x27;s Principle of Optimality is based on the idea that in order to solve a dynamic optimization problem from some starting period &quot;t&quot; to some ending period &quot;T&quot;, one implicitly has to solve subproblems starting from later dates &quot;s&quot;, where &quot;t</text><links>

<doc id="243110" wikidata="Q2308831" url="?curid=243110" title="Spectral method">
<text>Spectral methods are a class of techniques used in applied mathematics and scientific computing to numerically solve certain differential equations. The idea is to write the solution of the differential equation as a sum of certain &quot;basis functions&quot; (for example, as a Fourier series which is a sum of sinusoids) and then to choose the coefficients in the sum in order to satisfy the differential equation as well as possible.

Spectral methods and finite-element methods are closely related and built on the same ideas; the main difference between them is that spectral methods use basis functions that are generally nonzero over the whole domain, while finite element methods use basis functions that are nonzero only on small subdomains (compact support). Consequently, spectral methods connect variables &quot;globally&quot; while finite elements do so &quot;locally&quot;. Partially for this reason, spectral methods have excellent error properties, with the so-called &quot;exponential convergence&quot; being the fastest possible, when the solution is smooth. However, there are no known three-dimensional single-domain spectral shock capturing results (shock waves are not smooth). In the finite-element community, a method where the degree of the elements is very high or increases as the grid parameter &quot;h&quot; increases is sometimes called a spectral-element method.

Spectral methods can be used to solve differential equations (PDEs, ODEs, eigenvalue, etc) and optimization problems. When applying spectral methods to time-dependent PDEs, the solution is typically written as a sum of basis functions with time-dependent coefficients; substituting this in the PDE yields a system of ODEs in the coefficients which can be solved using any numerical method for ODEs. Eigenvalue problems for ODEs are similarly converted to matrix eigenvalue problems .

Spectral methods were developed in a long series of papers by Steven Orszag starting in 1969 including, but not limited to, Fourier series methods for periodic geometry problems, polynomial spectral methods for finite and unbounded geometry problems, pseudospectral methods for highly nonlinear problems, and spectral iteration methods for fast solution of steady-state problems. The implementation of the spectral method is normally accomplished either with collocation or a Galerkin or a Tau approach . For very small problems, the spectral method is unique in that solutions may be written out symbolically, yielding a practical alternative to series solutions for differential equations.

Spectral methods can be computationally less expensive and easier to implement than finite element methods; they shine best when high accuracy is sought in simple domains with smooth solutions. However, because of their global nature, the matrices associated with step computation are dense and computational efficiency will quickly suffer when there are many degrees of freedom (with some exceptions, for example if matrix applications can be written as Fourier transforms). For larger problems and nonsmooth solutions, finite elements will generally work better due to sparse matrices and better modelling of discontinuities and sharp bends.

==Examples of spectral methods==

===A concrete, linear example===

Here we presume an understanding of basic multivariate calculus and Fourier series. If formula_1 is a known, complex-valued function of two real variables, and g is periodic in x and y (that is, formula_2) then we are interested in finding a function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) so that

:formula_3
where the expression on the left denotes the second partial derivatives of &quot;f&quot; in &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, respectively. This is the Poisson equation, and can be physically interpreted as some sort of heat conduction problem, or a problem in potential theory, among other possibilities.

If we write &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; in Fourier series:

:formula_4

and substitute into the differential equation, we obtain this equation:

:formula_5

We have exchanged partial differentiation with an infinite sum, which is legitimate if we assume for instance that &quot;f&quot; has a continuous second derivative. By the uniqueness theorem for Fourier expansions, we must then equate the Fourier coefficients term by term, giving

{j^2+k^2}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

which is an explicit formula for the Fourier coefficients &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot;.

With periodic boundary conditions, the Poisson equation possesses a solution only if &quot;b&quot;0,0 = 0. Therefore, we can freely choose &quot;a&quot;0,0 which will be equal to the mean of the resolution. This corresponds to choosing the integration constant.

To turn this into an algorithm, only finitely many frequencies are solved for. This introduces an error which can be shown to be proportional to formula_6, where formula_7 and formula_8 is the highest frequency treated.

==== Algorithm ====

# Compute the Fourier transform (&quot;bj,k&quot;) of &quot;g&quot;.
# Compute the Fourier transform (&quot;aj,k&quot;) of &quot;f&quot; via the formula ().
# Compute &quot;f&quot; by taking an inverse Fourier transform of (&quot;aj,k&quot;).

Since we&#x27;re only interested in a finite window of frequencies (of size &quot;n&quot;, say) this can be done using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Therefore, globally the algorithm runs in 

===Nonlinear example===

We wish to solve the forced, transient, nonlinear Burgers&#x27; equation using a spectral approach.

Given formula_9 on the periodic domain
formula_10, find formula_11 such that
:formula_12
where ρ is the viscosity coefficient. In weak conservative form this becomes
:formula_13
where following inner product notation. Integrating by parts and using periodicity grants
:formula_14

To apply the Fourier–Galerkin method, choose both
:formula_15
and
:formula_16
where formula_17. This reduces the problem to finding formula_18 such that
:formula_19

Using the orthogonality relation formula_20 where formula_21 is the Kronecker delta, we simplify the above three terms for each formula_22 to see
:formula_23

Assemble the three terms for each formula_22 to obtain
:formula_25
Dividing through by formula_26, we finally arrive at
:formula_27
With Fourier transformed initial conditions formula_28 and forcing formula_29, this coupled system of ordinary differential equations may be integrated in time (using, e.g., a Runge Kutta technique) to find a solution. The nonlinear term is a convolution, and there are several transform-based techniques for evaluating it efficiently. See the references by Boyd and Canuto et al. for more details.

== A relationship with the spectral element method ==

One can show that if formula_30 is infinitely differentiable, then the numerical algorithm using Fast Fourier Transforms will converge faster than any polynomial in the grid size h. That is, for any n&gt;0, there is a formula_31 such that the error is less than formula_32 for all sufficiently small values of formula_33. We say that the spectral method is of order formula_8, for every n&gt;0.

Because a spectral element method is a finite element method of very high order, there is a similarity in the convergence properties. However, whereas the spectral method is based on the eigendecomposition of the particular boundary value problem, the finite element method does not use that information and works for arbitrary elliptic boundary value problems.

<text>Johann Georg Hamann (; ; 27 August 1730 – 21 June 1788) was a German Lutheran philosopher from Königsberg known as &quot;the Wizard of the North&quot; who was one of the leading figures of post-Kantian philosophy. His work was used by his student J. G. Herder as the main support of the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement, and is associated with the Counter-Enlightenment and Romanticism.

He introduced Kant, also from Königsberg, to the works of both Hume – waking him from his &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot; – and Rousseau. Hamann was influenced by Hume, but he used his views to argue for rather than against Christianity.

Goethe and Kierkegaard were among those who considered him to be the finest mind of his time. He was also a key influence on Hegel and Jacobi. Long before the linguistic turn, Hamann believed epistemology should be replaced by the philosophy of language.

==Early life==

Hamann was born on 27 August 1730 in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia). Initially he studied theology at the University of Königsberg, but became a clerk in a mercantile house and afterward held many small public offices, devoting his leisure to reading philosophy. His first publication was a study in political economy about a dispute on nobility and trade. He wrote under the pen name of &quot;the Magus of the North&quot; (). Hamann was a believer in the Enlightenment until a mystical experience in London in 1758. There, he underwent a profound Christian conversion, reorienting his whole life and philosophy around the prophetic illuminating power of the Bible. This shift influenced all his subsequent work, shaping his views of nature, reason, and human identity.

His translation of David Hume into German is considered by most scholars to be the one that Hamann&#x27;s friend Immanuel Kant, also from Königsberg, credited with awakening him from his &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot;. Hamann and Kant held each other in mutual respect, although Hamann once declined an invitation by Kant to co-write a physics textbook for children. Hamann also introduced Kant to the work of Rousseau.

=== Music ===
Hamann was a lutenist, having studied this instrument with Timofiy Bilohradsky (a student of Sylvius Leopold Weiss), a Ukrainian virtuoso then living in Königsberg.

==Philosophical views==
His distrust of autonomous, disembodied reason and the Enlightenment (&quot;I look upon logical proofs the way a well-bred girl looks upon a love letter&quot; was one of his many witticisms) led him to conclude that faith in God was the only solution to the vexing problems of philosophy.

One of Kant&#x27;s biographers compared him with Hamann: 

In Hamann&#x27;s own terms Kant was a &quot;Platonist&quot; about reason, believing it disembodied, and Hamann an &quot;Aristotelian&quot; who believed it was embodied. Hamann was greatly influenced by Hume. This is most evident in Hamann&#x27;s conviction that faith and belief, rather than knowledge, determine human actions. Also, Hamann asserted that the efficacy of a concept arises from the habits it reflects rather than any inherent quality it possesses.

=== Works ===
Hamann&#x27;s writings consist of small essays. They display two striking tendencies. The first is their brevity, in comparison with works by his contemporaries. The second is their breadth of allusion and delight in extended analogies. His work was also significantly reactive; rather than advance a &quot;position&quot; of his own, his principal mode of thinking was to respond to others&#x27; work. For example, his work &quot;Golgotha and Scheblimini! By a Preacher in the Wilderness&quot; (1784) was directed against Moses Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalem, or on Religious Might and Judaism&quot; (1782).

Hamann famously used the image of Socrates, who often proclaimed to know nothing, in his &quot;Socratic Memorabilia&quot;, an essay in which Hamann critiques the Enlightenment&#x27;s dependence on reason. In &quot;Aesthetica in nuce&quot;, Hamann counters the Enlightenment by emphasizing the importance of aesthetic experience and the role of genius in intuiting nature.

====Editions====
Fragments of his writings were published by Cramer, under the title of &quot;Sibyllinische Blätter des Magus aus Norden&quot; (1819), and a complete edition by Roth (7 vols., 1821–25, with a volume of additions and explanations by Wiener, 1843). &quot;Hamann&#x27;s des Magus in Norden Leben und Schriften&quot;, edited by Gildemeister, was published in 5 vols., 1857–68, and a new edition of his &quot;Schriften und Briefen&quot;, edited by Petri, in 4 vols., 1872–74.

===God===
Hamann argued that the communicatio idiomatum, namely, the communication of divine messages through material embodiments, applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: &quot;This communicatio of divine and human idiomatum is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.&quot;
Hamann believed all of creation were signs from God for us to interpret.

===Reason is language===
His most notable contributions to philosophy were his thoughts on language, which have often been considered as a forerunner to the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy such as Wittgenstein&#x27;s. He famously said that &quot;Reason is language&quot; (&quot;Vernunft ist Sprache&quot;). Hamann thought the bridge between Kant&#x27;s noumenal and phenomenal realms was language, with its noumenal meaning and phenomenal letters.

==Legacy==
Hamann was one of the precipitating forces for the Counter-Enlightenment. He was, moreover, a mentor to Herder and an admired influence on Goethe, Jacobi, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Lessing, and Mendelssohn. Roman Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar devoted a chapter to Hamann in his volume, &quot;Studies in Theological Styles: Lay Styles&quot; (Volume III in the English language translation of &quot;The Glory of the Lord&quot; series). Most recently, Hamann&#x27;s influence can be found in the work of the theologians Oswald Bayer (Lutheran), John Milbank (Anglican), and David Bentley Hart (Eastern Orthodox). Finally, in Charles Taylor&#x27;s important summative work, &quot;The Language Animal: The Full Shape of the Human Linguistic Capacity&quot; (Taylor, 2016), Hamann is given credit, along with Wilhelm von Humboldt and Herder, for inspiring Taylor&#x27;s &quot;HHH&quot; approach to the philosophy of language, emphasizing the creative power and cultural specificity of language.

However, recent scholarship, such as that by Bayer, contradicts the usual interpretation by people such as historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin, and describes Hamann as a &quot;radical Enlightener&quot; who vigorously opposed dogmatic rationalism in matters of philosophy and faith. Bayer views him as less the proto-Romantic that Herder presented, and more a premodern-postmodern thinker who brought the consequences of Lutheran theology to bear upon the burgeoning Enlightenment and especially in reaction to Kant.

<doc id="243134" wikidata="Q220060" url="?curid=243134" title="Hess's law">
<text>Hess&#x27;s law of constant heat summation, also known simply as Hess&#x27;s law, is a relationship in physical chemistry and thermodynamics named after Germain Hess, a Swiss-born Russian chemist and physician who published it in 1840. The law states that the total enthalpy change during the complete course of a chemical reaction is independent of the sequence of steps taken.

Hess&#x27;s law is now understood as an expression of the fact that the enthalpy of a chemical process is independent of the path taken from the initial to the final state (i.e. enthalpy is a state function). According to the first law of thermodynamics, the enthalpy change in a system due to a reaction at constant pressure is equal to the heat absorbed (or the negative of the heat released), which can be determined by calorimetry for many reactions. The values are usually stated for reactions with the same initial and final temperatures and pressures (while conditions are allowed to vary during the course of the reactions). Hess&#x27;s law can be used to determine the overall energy required for a chemical reaction that can be divided into synthetic steps that are individually easier to characterize. This affords the compilation of standard enthalpies of formation, which may be used to predict the enthalpy change in complex synthesis.

==Theory==
Hess&#x27;s law states that the change of enthalpy in a chemical reaction is the same regardless of whether the reaction takes place in one step or several steps, provided the initial and final states of the reactants and products are the same. Enthalpy is an extensive property, meaning that its value is proportional to the system size. Because of this, the enthalpy change is proportional to the number of moles participating in a given reaction.

In other words, if a chemical change takes place by several different routes, the overall enthalpy change is the same, regardless of the route by which the chemical change occurs (provided the initial and final condition are the same). If this were not true, then one could violate the first law of thermodynamics.

Hess&#x27;s law allows the enthalpy change (Δ&quot;H&quot;) for a reaction to be calculated even when it cannot be measured directly. This is accomplished by performing basic algebraic operations based on the chemical equations of reactions using previously determined values for the enthalpies of formation.

Combination of chemical equations leads to a net or overall equation. If the enthalpy changes are known for all the equations in the sequence, their sum will be the enthalpy change for the net equation. If the net enthalpy change is negative (formula_1), the reaction is exothermic and is more likely to be spontaneous; positive Δ&quot;H&quot; values correspond to endothermic reactions. (Entropy also plays an important role in determining spontaneity, as some reactions with a positive enthalpy change are nevertheless spontaneous due to an entropy increase in the reaction system.)

==Use of enthalpies of formation==
Hess&#x27;s law states that enthalpy changes are additive. Thus the value of the standard enthalpy of reaction can be calculated from standard enthalpies of formation of products and reactants as follows: 
:formula_2
Here, the first sum is over all products and the second over all reactants, formula_3 and formula_4 are the stoichiometric coefficients of products and reactants respectively, formula_5 andformula_6 are the standard enthalpies of formation of products and reactants respectively, and the o superscript indicates standard state values. This may be considered as the sum of two (real or fictitious) reactions:
:Reactants → Elements (in their standard states)
:formula_7
and Elements → Products &lt;br&gt;
:formula_8

==Examples==
==Extension to free energy and entropy==
The concepts of Hess&#x27;s law can be expanded to include changes in entropy and in Gibbs free energy, since these are also state functions. The Bordwell thermodynamic cycle is an example of such an extension that takes advantage of easily measured equilibria and redox potentials to determine experimentally inaccessible Gibbs free energy values. Combining Δ&quot;G&quot;o values from Bordwell thermodynamic cycles and Δ&quot;H&quot;o values found with Hess&#x27;s law can be helpful in determining entropy values that have not been measured directly and therefore need to be calculated through alternative paths.

For the free energy:
:formula_9

For entropy, the situation is a little different. Because entropy can be measured as an absolute value, not relative to those of the elements in their reference states (as with Δ&quot;H&quot;o and Δ&quot;G&quot;o), there is no need to use the entropy of formation; one simply uses the absolute entropies for products and reactants:
:formula_10

==Applications==
Hess&#x27;s law is useful in the determination of enthalpies of the following:
#Heats of formation of unstable intermediates like CO(g) and NO(g).
#Heat changes in phase transitions and allotropic transitions.
#Lattice energies of ionic substances by constructing Born–Haber cycles if the electron affinity to form the anion is known, or
#Electron affinities using a Born–Haber cycle with a theoretical lattice energy.

<doc id="243145" wikidata="Q1725855" url="?curid=243145" title="Samuel Roxy Rothafel">
<text>Samuel Lionel &quot;Roxy&quot; Rothafel (July 9, 1882 – January 13, 1936) was an American theatrical impresario and entrepreneur. He is noted for developing the lavish presentation of silent films in the deluxe movie palace theaters of the 1910s and 1920s.

==Life and career==
Samuel Rothafel (originally Rothapfel, meaning ‘‘Red Apple’’, the modern German spelling is: Rotapfel) was born in Bromberg, Province of Posen, Prussia, Germany, (now Bydgoszcz, Poland), and was the son of Cecelia (née Schwerzens) and Gustav Rothapfel. In 1886, at the age of three, he and his mother boarded the S/S Rugia, sailing from Hamburg to the Port of New York on May 24, 1886. In that same year, Rothafel and his parents moved to Stillwater, Minnesota. In 1895 at the age of thirteen, Rothafel moved to New York with his family. He became estranged from his father when he lost interest in his studies and nearly two years after his mother’s death in 1897, he was forced out of his father’s house. Before setting out to create and establish notable movie theaters in New York City, Rothafel pursued any job he could get to make ends meet. He served seven years in the U.S Marine Corps where he saw action in China’s Boxer Rebellion. After being discharged Rothafel moved back to Philadelphia as a decorated marine. Samuel Rothafel is best known by his nickname, &quot;Roxy.&quot; He was the impresario who brought the great New York City movie palaces that he managed to fame and popular success.

In 1908 he first began his show business career in Forest City, Pennsylvania, where he created the &quot;Family Theater&quot;, a combination cinema and skating rink in the backroom of a local saloon. In 1912 he came to New York City, where he would achieve his greatest successes. In New York at different times he managed and produced shows at the Regent, Strand, Rialto, Rivoli, and Capitol theaters.

Often considered his greatest achievement was his eponymous Roxy Theatre at Times Square which opened March 11, 1927. He later opened the Radio City Music Hall and the RKO Roxy (later the Center Theatre) in 1932, his last theatrical project. The Music Hall featured the precision dance troupe the Roxyettes (later renamed The Rockettes), which Rothafel brought with him from the Roxy Theatre.

Rothafel has been credited with many movie presentation innovations, including synchronizing orchestral music to movies (in the silent film era) and having multiple projectors to effect seamless reel changes. The book &quot;The Best Remaining Seats&quot; by Ben M. Hall (1961), gives a good overview of the movie palaces of the 1920s and, specifically, of Roxy himself.

Roxy grew up with a Jewish background that continued to influence him throughout his life. In 1923 a journalist noted that Rothafel’s the Regent Roxy theater attempted to appeal to Jewish audiences with its spectacular music capabilities. Roxy also hired Hungarian Jewish violinist Eugene Ormandy to play and conduct in his theaters, which boosted Ormandy’s career. Roxy was also the target of anti-semitism, as seen in the diary of American author Theodore Dreiser who wrote: “clever Jew who has become managing director of three great movie houses in New York,&quot; as well as other racial slurs after Dreiser made a 1916 visit to one of Roxy’s theaters.

Rothafel had health issues in his later life, mainly angina pectoris. He died of a heart attack in his sleep on January 13, 1936, in New York City aged 53. He is buried in Linden Hill Jewish cemetery in Queens, New York.

His wife was Rosa Freedman. His son was Arthur Ingram Rothafel, journalist, writer and ski reporter. His daughter, Beta Rothafel, married Lawrence Harold Levy, the son of Samuel Levy, a New York City lawyer, businessman, and public official, who served as Manhattan borough president. Through Rothafel&#x27;s granddaughter, Penny (Levy), he is the great-grandfather of actress Amanda Peet.

===Radio===
Roxy also made a name for himself on network radio, where he began broadcasting in mid-November 1922. Through 1925, live broadcasts of his weekly variety show, &quot;Roxy and His Gang&quot; from the Capitol Theatre (New York City), became increasingly popular. One estimate from 1924 placed his typical radio audience at about five million listeners, and he was said to receive thousands of pieces of fan mail weekly. After Rothafel left the Capitol, his radio show, now known as &quot;The Roxy Hour,&quot; was broadcast from the new Roxy Theatre on NBC&#x27;s Blue Network from 1927 to 1932.

<doc id="243204" wikidata="Q217685" url="?curid=243204" title="Caligula (film)">
<text>Caligula () is a 1979 erotic historical drama film about the rise and fall of Roman Emperor Caligula. The film stars Malcolm McDowell in the title role, alongside Teresa Ann Savoy, Helen Mirren, Peter O&#x27;Toole, John Steiner, and John Gielgud.

Original screenwriter Gore Vidal and film director Tinto Brass both disavowed the extensive changes to their contributions, with Brass dismissed prior to editing. Financier producer Bob Guccione, founder of &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine, engaged Giancarlo Lui to film post-production scenes featuring hardcore sex, significantly altering the film&#x27;s tone and style.

Initially released to Italian cinemas in 1979, then screened in America the following year, &quot;Caligula&quot; was met with legal issues and controversies over its violent and sexual content. Different abridged versions were released worldwide, while its uncut form remains banned in several countries. Despite a generally negative reception, the film has gained notoriety as a cult classic with significant merit for its political content and historical portrayal.

A 178-minute &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot;, approved by McDowell and consisting entirely of new archival footage not used for the previous theatrical release, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2023, receiving more favorable reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Caligula is the young heir to the throne of his great-uncle, Emperor Tiberius. One morning, a blackbird flies into his room; Caligula considers this a bad omen. Shortly afterward, one of the heads of the Praetorian Guard, Naevius Sutorius Macro, tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at Capri, where the Emperor lives with his close friend Nerva, Caligula&#x27;s dim-witted uncle Claudius, and Caligula&#x27;s cousin (Tiberius&#x27;s grandson) Gemellus. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave, but his sister and lover Drusilla persuades him to go.

At Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading sex shows that include deformed people and animals; Caligula observes with fascination and horror. Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus. Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve. Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.

After Tiberius&#x27;s death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Drusilla, fearful of Macro&#x27;s influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula sets up a mock trial in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro&#x27;s wife Ennia banished from Rome. After Macro is executed in a gruesome public game, Caligula appoints Tiberius&#x27;s former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator Chaerea as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.

Drusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the cult they secretly practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries Caesonia, a priestess and notorious courtesan, after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula&#x27;s popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula&#x27;s personality emerge when he brutally rapes a virgin bride and her husband on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus&#x27;s execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.

After discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula develops a severe fever. Drusilla nurses him back to health. Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, Julia Drusilla. During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he had had. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird. Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever. Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula has a nervous breakdown and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla&#x27;s body.

Now in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla. After a brief stay in a city gaol, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe. The new reign he leads becomes a series of humiliations against the foundations of Romesenators&#x27; wives are forced to work in the service of the state as prostitutes, estates are confiscated, the old religion is desecrated, and the army is made to embark on a mock invasion of Britain. Unable to further tolerate his actions, Longinus conspires with Chaerea to assassinate Caligula.

Caligula enters his bedroom where a nervous Caesonia awaits him. Another blackbird appears but only Caesonia is frightened of it. The next morning, the two rehearse an Egyptian play, Claudius becomes suspicious of Chaerea and follows him to the event. Shortly, Caligula and his family are attacked in a coup headed by Chaerea. Caesonia and Julia are murdered, and Chaerea stabs Caligula in the stomach. With his final breath, the Emperor defiantly whimpers &quot;I live!&quot; as Caligula and his family&#x27;s bodies are thrown down the stadium&#x27;s stairs. Claudius witnesses the entire ordeal and is horrified even after being proclaimed Emperor by the Praetorian Guard. The people of Rome, having grown accustomed to the overall chaos, clean the blood off the marble floors.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
The men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Penthouse&quot; had long been involved in film funding, helping invest in films made by other studios, including &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, but it had never produced a film on its own. The magazine&#x27;s founder Bob Guccione wanted to produce an explicit adult film within a feature film narrative that had high production values; he decided to produce a film about the rise and fall of the Roman emperor Caligula. Development began under producer Franco Rossellini, the nephew of filmmaker Roberto Rossellini. A screenplay was written by Lina Wertmüller, but Guccione rejected Wertmüller&#x27;s script and paid Gore Vidal to write a new screenplay. Vidal&#x27;s script had a strong focus on homosexuality, leading Guccione to demand rewrites which toned down the gay content for wider audience appeal. Guccione was concerned that Vidal&#x27;s script contained several gay sex scenes and only one scene of heterosexual sex, which was between Caligula and his sister Drusilla. Vidal was paid for his screenplay, titled &quot;Gore Vidal&#x27;s Caligula&quot;.

Elaborate sets were built by production designer Danilo Donati, who also designed the film&#x27;s costumes, jewelry, hairstyles, wigs, and makeup. Several mainstream actors were cast, Guccione intending to make a film that he felt, like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, would be a landmark in cinematic history. Guccione offered directing duties to John Huston and Lina Wertmüller, both of whom rejected the film. After viewing scenes from the film &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;, Guccione agreed to have lunch with that film&#x27;s director, Tinto Brass, believing Brass would be the ideal person to direct &quot;Caligula&quot;. Brass had a reputation for being difficult to deal with on film sets but Guccione thought the film&#x27;s epic scope would &quot;keep [Brass] in line&quot; and that Brass understood the concept of the film enough to direct it. Brass described Vidal&#x27;s screenplay as &quot;the work of an aging arteriosclerotic&quot; and agreed to direct only if he was allowed to rewrite Vidal&#x27;s screenplay. Brass&#x27;s screenplay expanded the sexual content to include orgies, decorative phalluses, and much female nudity. Guccione said Brass&#x27;s rewrites were done out of necessity to the film&#x27;s visual narrative and did not alter the dialogue or content.

In an interview for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Vidal said that in film production, directors were &quot;parasites&quot; and a film&#x27;s author was its screenwriter; in response, Brass demanded Vidal&#x27;s removal from the set and Guccione agreed. Guccione considered the film to be a &quot;collective effort, involving the input of a great number of artists and craftsmen&quot;, and the director to be the leader of a &quot;team effort&quot;. Vidal filed a contractual dispute over the film because of Brass&#x27;s rewrites; Guccione said Vidal had demanded 10% of the film&#x27;s profits, which Vidal said was not the case. Vidal distanced himself from the production, calling Brass a &quot;megalomaniac&quot;. Brass publicly stated, &quot;If I ever really get mad at Gore Vidal, I&#x27;ll publish his script&quot;. Vidal&#x27;s name was removed from the film&#x27;s title; the credits were changed to state that the film was &quot;adapted from a screenplay by Gore Vidal&quot;, crediting no official screenwriter. Guccione said, &quot;Gore&#x27;s work was basically done and Tinto&#x27;s work was about to begin&quot;.

===Themes===
The film&#x27;s primary theme is &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;. Vidal&#x27;s script presented Caligula as a good man driven to madness by absolute power; Brass&#x27;s screenplay envisioned Caligula as a &quot;born monster&quot;. In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Epic Films&quot;, author Djoymi Baker describes Brass&#x27;s screenplay as &quot;an antiepic with an antihero, on a path of self-inflicted, antisocial descent&quot;. Guccione said this final draft was more violent than sexual, stating, &quot;I maintain the film is actually anti-erotic ... in every one of its scenes you&#x27;ll find a mixture of gore or violence or some other rather ugly things&quot;.

===Casting===
Orson Welles was initially offered $1 million to star as Tiberius, a figure which would have been his highest ever salary, but he refused on moral grounds when he read the script. Gore Vidal expressed disbelief that this could have ever been the case as he felt that Welles could not have portrayed Tiberius, but then recalled Kenneth Tynan remarking to him at the time that Welles was &quot;upset&quot; by the script. Renowned actors who did accept roles in the film included Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O&#x27;Toole and Sir John Gielgud, with Maria Schneider cast as Caligula&#x27;s doomed sister Drusilla. Schneider became uncomfortable with appearing nude and in sexual scenes, and left the production, to be replaced by Teresa Ann Savoy, with whom Brass had previously worked on &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;. Schneider had also apparently angered Brass by sewing up the open tunics she was supposed to wear on camera. Gielgud was also offered the role of Tiberius, which he declined, as he felt Vidal&#x27;s script was &quot;pornographic&quot;, but he later accepted the shorter role of Nerva. Director Tinto Brass cast his own acquaintances as senators and noblemen, including ex-convicts, thieves and anarchists. Guccione cast Penthouse Pets as female extras in sexual scenes.

=== Filming ===

Principal photography began in 1976 in Rome. McDowell got along well with Tinto Brass, while Peter O&#x27;Toole immediately disliked the director. John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were indifferent to Brass; they ultimately trusted his direction and focused on their own performances. O&#x27;Toole had stopped drinking alcohol before filming, but Guccione described O&#x27;Toole as being &quot;strung out on something&quot; and said the actor was not sober during the entire filming schedule.

Guccione later complained about McDowell&#x27;s behavior, calling the actor &quot;shallow&quot; and &quot;stingy&quot;. According to Guccione, during the film&#x27;s production, McDowell took members of the production to dinner at an expensive restaurant to celebrate England&#x27;s win in a football match against the Italian team, and left the choreographer to pay for the meal, saying he had forgotten to bring enough money. Also according to Guccione, at the end of the production, McDowell gave his dresser a pendant bearing her name, but it was misspelled and she gave it back to him. McDowell offered her a signet ring, a prop from the film. She refused because it belonged to the production company.

Brass decided not to focus much on Danilo Donati&#x27;s elaborate sets, and intentionally kept the Penthouse Pets in the background during sex scenes, sometimes not filming them at all. Guccione later said that Brass, apparently as a joke, would focus on &quot;fat, ugly and wrinkled old women&quot; and have them play the &quot;sensual parts&quot; intended for the Penthouse Pets. Brass and Guccione disagreed about the film&#x27;s approach to sexual content; Guccione preferred unsimulated sexual content that Brass did not want to film.

===Post-production===
Filming concluded on 24 December 1976. Guccione said Brass shot enough film to &quot;make the original version of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; about 50 times over&quot;. Brass started editing the film but was not allowed to continue after he had edited approximately the first hour of it. His rough cut was disassembled, and the film was edited by several editors, changing its tone and structure significantly by removing and re-arranging many scenes, using different takes, a slower editing style, and music other than Brass intended.

A few weeks after filming had concluded, Guccione and Giancarlo Lui returned to Rome along with several Penthouse Pets. Guccione and Lui &quot;hired a skeleton crew, snuck back into the studios at night, raided the prop room&quot; and shot a number of hardcore sex scenes to be edited into the film. The new unsimulated sex scenes included Penthouse pets Anneka Di Lorenzo and Lori Wagner, who appeared as supporting characters in Brass&#x27;s original footage. Both performed a lesbian scene together. Brass ultimately disowned the film as a result, and the credits only list &quot;principal photography by Tinto Brass&quot;.

Although there were a number of editors on the film, their names were not credited. Instead, the credit &quot;Editing by the Production&quot; is given during the opening credits.
As it was intended for an international release, the film was shot entirely in English. It was shot with sound, but there was so much noise at the studios that the main English-speaking actors had to re-record many of their lines later. However, as many of the supporting actors/actresses were Italian, their lines needed to be dubbed in English by other performers.

Peter O&#x27;Toole was reluctant to re-record his English dialogue; he avoided the film&#x27;s producers, though they eventually tracked him down to Canada where they &quot;dragged him in front of a mike&quot; to record his dialogue. After production ended, O&#x27;Toole expressed his dislike of the film (although, according to Guccione, he had not even seen the rushes) and doubted that it would ever be released.

&quot;Caligula&quot; spent so much time in post-production that the film&#x27;s co-producer Franco Rossellini feared that it would never be released. Rossellini then decided to make &quot;Caligula&quot; expensive sets and costumes profitable by using them in &quot;Messalina, Messalina!&quot;, a sex comedy directed by Bruno Corbucci. That film was released in Italy in 1977, two years before &quot;Caligula&quot; could be shown to the public. In some territories, it was released after &quot;Caligula&quot; and falsely marketed as its sequel. Anneka Di Lorenzo (as the title character) and Lori Wagner both reprised their roles from &quot;Caligula&quot; in Corbucci&#x27;s film. Danilo Donati&#x27;s sets and costumes were reused without his permission.

==Soundtrack==

The film was scored by Bruno Nicolai under the name Paul Clemente. According to Kristopher Spencer, the score &quot;is gloriously dramatic, capturing both the decadent atmosphere of ancient Rome and the twisted tragedy of its true story&quot;. The score also featured music by Aram Khachaturian (from &quot;Spartacus&quot;) and Sergei Prokofiev (from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;). In November 1980, Guccione formed Penthouse Records to release a double album soundtrack to &quot;Caligula&quot;. The album featured Nicolai&#x27;s score and two versions—one in a disco style—of the love theme &quot;We Are One&quot;, which did not appear in the film.

==Release==

An edited version of the film had a limited run in a small town near Forlì, Italy before opening in Rome on Sunday, November 11, 1979. In Rome, it was the highest-grossing film of the weekend, with a gross of $59,950 () from 6 theaters. The film was confiscated by Italian police on November 15 with the Pubblico Ministero calling many scenes in the film &quot;flagrantly obscene&quot;.

In the United States, Guccione refused to submit &quot;Caligula&quot; to the MPAA because he did not want the film to receive a ratingeven Xwhich he considered to be &quot;demeaning&quot;. Instead, Guccione applied his own &quot;Mature Audiences&quot; rating to the film, instructing theater owners not to admit anyone under the age of 18. The film premiered in the United States on 1 February 1980, at the Trans Lux East Theatre, which Guccione had rented exclusively to screen the film; he changed the theater&#x27;s name to Penthouse East.

Rather than leasing prints to exhibitors, the distributor rented theaters that specialized in foreign and art films for the purpose of screening &quot;Caligula&quot; exclusively in order to keep the film out of theaters that showed pornographic films. In 1981, the Brazilian Board of Censors approved the establishment of special theaters to screen &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; and &quot;Caligula&quot; because they were international box office hits.

&quot;Caligula&quot; grossed (equivalent to $ million in ) at the box office. The film was a financial success in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan. A 105-minute R-rated version without the explicit sexual material was released in 1981.

The script was adapted as a novelisation by William Johnston using the pseudonym William Howard.

===Legal problems===
In 1979, when Guccione tried to import the film&#x27;s footage into the U.S., customs officials seized it. Federal officials did not declare the film to be obscene. When the film was released in New York City, the anti-pornography organization Morality in Media unsuccessfully filed a lawsuit against these federal officials.

In Boston, authorities seized the film. &quot;Penthouse&quot; took legal action, partly because Guccione thought the legal challenges and moral controversies would provide &quot;the kind of [marketing] coverage money can never buy&quot;. &quot;Penthouse&quot; won the case when a Boston Municipal Court ruled that &quot;Caligula&quot; had passed the Miller test and was not obscene. While the Boston judge said the film &quot;lacked artistic and scientific value&quot; because of its depiction of sex and considered it to &quot;[appeal] to prurient interests&quot;, he said the film&#x27;s depiction of ancient Rome contained political values which enabled it to pass the Miller test in its depiction of corruption in ancient Rome, which dramatized the political theme that &quot;absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;. A Madison, Wisconsin, district attorney declined an anti-pornography crusader&#x27;s request to prevent the release of &quot;Caligula&quot; on the basis that &quot;the most offensive portions of the film are those explicitly depicting violent, and not sexual conduct, which is not in any way prohibited by the criminal law&quot;.

Atlanta prosecutors threatened legal action if the film was to be screened in the city, but experts testified in court on behalf of the film, and Atlanta, too, declared that the film was not obscene. Citizens for Decency through Law, a private watchdog group that protested against films that it deemed immoral, sought to prevent the film&#x27;s exhibition in Fairlawn, Ohio, on the grounds that it would be a &quot;public nuisance&quot;, leading &quot;Penthouse&quot; to withdraw the film from exhibition there to avoid another trial. CDL&#x27;s lawyer advised against attempting to prosecute &quot;Penthouse&quot; for obscenity and instead recommended a civil proceeding, because the film would not be placed against the Miller test. The &quot;Penthouse&quot; attorney described the Fairlawn events as being driven by conservative morality reinforced by Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidential victory, stating: &quot;Apparently, these extremists have interpreted a change by the administration to mean a clarion call for a mandate to shackle the public&#x27;s mind again.&quot; The uncut film was granted a certificate by the British Board of Film Classification in 2008. The film was banned in Australia, where it continued to be banned in its uncut form until 2021.

In 1981, Anneka Di Lorenzo, who played Messalina, sued Guccione, claiming sexual harassment. In 1990, after protracted litigation, a New York state court awarded her $60,000 in compensatory damages and $4 million in punitive damages. On appeal, the court vacated the award, ruling that punitive damages were not allowed by the law governing the case.

===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Caligula&quot; received generally negative reviews. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, calling it &quot;sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash&quot;. Ebert wrote: &quot;In the two hours of this film that I saw, there were no scenes of joy, natural pleasure, or good sensual cheer. There was, instead, a nauseating excursion into base and sad fantasies.&quot; It was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out of—he walked out 2 hours into its 170-minute length after feeling &quot;disgusted and unspeakably depressed&quot;. He and Gene Siskel selected the film as one of their &quot;dogs of the year&quot; in a 1980 episode of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. Hank Werba of &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as a &quot;moral holocaust&quot; in his review. Rex Reed called &quot;Caligula&quot; &quot;a trough of rotten swill&quot;. Jay Scott, reviewing &quot;Caligula&quot; for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, said, &quot;&quot;Caligula&quot; doesn&#x27;t really work on any level&quot;. Scott unfavourably compared &quot;Caligula&quot; with &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;, describing the latter film as a better treatment of extreme sexuality. Scott&#x27;s review went on to say &quot;Rome would seem to be at least as fecund a territory for the cinematic exploration of sex, death and money, as pre-war Japan ... but what&#x27;s missing from &quot;Caligula&quot;, which is rife with all three, is any connective tissue (also any point of view, any thought, any meaning)&quot;. Scott concluded his review by claiming the whole film&#x27;s production was &quot;a boondoggle of landmark proportions&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; critic David Denby described the film as &quot;an infinitely degraded version of &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot;&quot;. Tom Milne (&quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;) stated that the film was &quot;by no means so awesomely bad as most critics have been pleased to report—but pretty bad all the same&quot; and found the film to be &quot;notable chiefly for the accuracy with which it reflects [Caligula&#x27;s] anonymity&quot;.

==Legacy==
Several films were released in the following years as attempts to cash in on &quot;Caligula&quot; reputation, including &quot;Caligula and Messalina&quot; (1981), directed by Bruno Mattei and &quot;Caligula... The Untold Story&quot; (1982), directed by Joe D&#x27;Amato. Like &quot;Caligula&quot;, D&#x27;Amato&#x27;s film exists in several softcore and hardcore versions.

In 1985, the hardcore version of &quot;Caligula&quot; was broadcast in France on Canal+, making it the first film with unsimulated sex scenes ever shown on French television. The film, which had been broadcast as a test, became the starting point of Canal+&#x27;s tradition of showing one pornographic film at midnight every month.

&quot;Caligula&quot; continued to garner negative reception long after its release. Writers for &quot;The Hamilton Spectator&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; said &quot;Caligula&quot; was one of the worst films they&#x27;d seen. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Keith Phipps said, &quot;As a one-of-a-kind marriage of the historical epic and the porn film ... &quot;Caligula&quot; deserves a look. But it might be better to let Guccione&#x27;s savagely unpleasant folly fade into the century that spawned it&quot;.

Leslie Halliwell said &quot;Caligula&quot; was &quot;a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sado-masochists&quot;. &quot;Time Out London&quot; called it &quot;a dreary shambles&quot;. Positive criticism of the film came from Moviehole reviewer Clint Morris, who awarded it 3 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;[a] classic in the coolest sense of the word&quot;. &quot;New Times&quot; critic Gregory Weinkauf gave the film 3 out of 5, calling it &quot;Kinda dumb and tacky, but at least it&#x27;s a real movie&quot;. &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; reviewer Philip Martin also gave the film 3 out of 5.

===Retrospective recognition===
&quot;Caligula&quot; has been described as a &quot;cult classic&quot; by William Hawes in a book about the film. Helen Mirren has defended her involvement in the making of &quot;Caligula&quot; and even described the final product of the film as &quot;an irresistible mix of art and genitals&quot;.

In 2005, artist Francesco Vezzoli produced a fake trailer for an alleged remake called &quot;Gore Vidal&#x27;s Caligula&quot; as a promotion for Versace&#x27;s new line of accessories; the fake trailer featured Mirren as &quot;the Empress Tiberius&quot;, Gerard Butler as Chaerea, Milla Jovovich as Drusilla, Courtney Love as Caligula and Karen Black as Agrippina the Elder, and an introduction by Gore Vidal. It was screened worldwide, including New York City&#x27;s Whitney Museum of American Art&#x27;s 2006 Whitney Biennial.

Leonardo DiCaprio has cited &quot;Caligula&quot; as an influence on his performance as Jordan Belfort in &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;. Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Megalopolis&quot; has been compared to &quot;Caligula&quot;.

===Reconstruction===
==== 2024: &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; ====

Producer Thomas Negovan announced a reconstruction of the film in 2020, seeking to follow Gore Vidal&#x27;s original screenplay (rather than the visions of either Brass or Guccione). Consisting of previously unreleased material, this 178-minute &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. Brass responded by taking legal action against Penthouse Films, saying: &quot;After numerous and fruitless negotiations that have followed over the years, first with the Penthouse and then with other unclear individuals, to edit the material that I shot and which had been found in the Penthouse archives, a version has been created on which I did not take part and which I am convinced will not reflect my artistic vision. [...] The Cannes audience will therefore be misled by the arbitrary use of my name.&quot; McDowell responded positively to this version, writing on Instagram: &quot;Because of the brilliant work of Thomas Negovan – one of my best performances has finally come to light after 47 years!&quot;

In April 2024, Drafthouse Films acquired the &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; for North American distribution, and released it theatrically in August 2024, followed by a streaming and 4K UHD Blu-ray release, the latter of which featured new interviews with McDowell and Negovan.

The &quot;Ultimate Cut&quot; received moderately positive reviews from critics.

<doc id="243227" wikidata="Q4919359" url="?curid=243227" title="Tarjan's off-line lowest common ancestors algorithm">
<text>In computer science, Tarjan&#x27;s off-line lowest common ancestors algorithm is an algorithm for computing lowest common ancestors for pairs of nodes in a tree, based on the union-find data structure. The lowest common ancestor of two nodes &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; in a rooted tree &quot;T&quot; is the node &quot;g&quot; that is an ancestor of both &quot;d&quot; and &quot;e&quot; and that has the greatest depth in &quot;T&quot;. It is named after Robert Tarjan, who discovered the technique in 1979. Tarjan&#x27;s algorithm is an offline algorithm; that is, unlike other lowest common ancestor algorithms, it requires that all pairs of nodes for which the lowest common ancestor is desired must be specified in advance. The simplest version of the algorithm uses the union-find data structure, which unlike other lowest common ancestor data structures can take more than constant time per operation when the number of pairs of nodes is similar in magnitude to the number of nodes. A later refinement by speeds the algorithm up to linear time.

== Pseudocode ==

The pseudocode below determines the lowest common ancestor of each pair in &quot;P&quot;, given the root &quot;r&quot; of a tree in which the children of node &quot;n&quot; are in the set &quot;n.children&quot;. For this offline algorithm, the set &quot;P&quot; must be specified in advance. It uses the &quot;MakeSet&quot;, &quot;Find&quot;, and &quot;Union&quot; functions of a disjoint-set data structure. &quot;MakeSet(u)&quot; removes &quot;u&quot; to a singleton set, &quot;Find(u)&quot; returns the standard representative of the set containing &quot;u&quot;, and &quot;Union(u,v)&quot; merges the set containing &quot;u&quot; with the set containing &quot;v&quot;.
TarjanOLCA(&quot;r&quot;) is first called on the root &quot;r&quot;.

 function TarjanOLCA(u) is
 MakeSet(u)
 u.ancestor := u
 for each v in u.children do
 TarjanOLCA(v)
 Union(u, v)
 Find(u).ancestor := u
 u.color := black
 for each v such that {u, v} in P do
 if v.color == black then
 print &quot;Tarjan&#x27;s Lowest Common Ancestor of &quot; + u +
 &quot; and &quot; + v + &quot; is &quot; + Find(v).ancestor + &quot;.&quot;

Each node is initially white, and is colored black after it and all its children have been visited.

For each node pair &quot;{u,v}&quot; to be investigated:
* When &quot;v&quot; is already black (viz. when &quot;v&quot; comes before &quot;u&quot; in a post-order traversal of the tree): After &quot;u&quot; is colored black, the lowest common ancestor of this pair is available as &quot;Find(v).ancestor&quot;, but only while the LCA of &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; is not colored black.
* Otherwise: Once &quot;v&quot; is colored black, the LCA will be available as &quot;Find(u).ancestor&quot;, while the LCA is not colored black.

For reference, here are optimized versions of &quot;MakeSet&quot;, &quot;Find&quot;, and &quot;Union&quot; for a disjoint-set forest:

 function MakeSet(x) is
 x.parent := x
 x.rank := 1
 function Union(x, y) is
 xRoot := Find(x)
 yRoot := Find(y)

<text>Lucius Valerius Poplicola Potitus ( 450–446 BC) was a patrician who, together with Marcus Horatius Barbatus, opposed the second decemvirate in 449 BC when that body showed despotic tendencies. In honor of their efforts, the pair were elected consuls for the remainder of that year.

== Potitus and the Decemvirate ==
The two men were patricians who stood up when a plebeian was being abused by the despotic second decemvirate, spoke critically of the decemviri and showed sympathy towards the plebeians. When the plebeians rebelled in the second plebeian secession they were chosen as negotiators because their previous actions had put them in a favourable light in the eyes of the plebeians, who felt that they were trustworthy. When the demands of the plebeians were met and the secession was called off, both men were elected as consuls. They passed the Valerio-Horatian Laws (&quot;Leges Veleriae-Horatiae&quot;). The first law established that the resolutions (plebiscites) of the Plebeian Council were binding on whole people, including the patricians. The second law restored the right of appeal to the people which had been suspended during the two decemvirates and added the provision that no official exempt from the right of appeal was to be appointed and in the case of such an appointment anyone could lawfully kill him. The third law put the principle of the inviolability (sacrosanctity) of the plebeian tribunes (the representatives of the plebeians) into the statutes. Previously, this principle was only enshrined in the religious sanction of the &quot;lex sacrata&quot;.

Both the story of the first and the second decemvirates have been questioned by some modern historians who think that the second decemvirate was a fiction. This would put into question the historicity of the second plebeian secession, the consulship of Lucius Valerius and his colleague and the Valerio-Horatian Laws. Mommsen and Cornell are among the historians who defend the historicity of at least the core of the story. The Valerio-Horatian Laws have also been questioned. Regarding the law on the right of appeal, there were two other such laws by consuls from the Valeria family (dated 509 BC and 300 BC) and the argument is that only the last one is historical. Regarding the law of the resolution of the Plebeian Council, there were two other laws with the same provision, the &quot;Lex Publilia&quot; of 339 BC and the &quot;Lex Hortensia&quot; of 287 BC. Again, it is argued that only the last law is historical. Other historians have defended the historicity of these laws.

== Quaestorship ==
Three years after his consulship, in 446 BC, Valerius was elected Quaestor together with Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus. They were, according to Tacitus, the first elected quaestors of the Republic.

<doc id="243274" wikidata="Q453874" url="?curid=243274" title="Marcus Valerius Corvus">
<text>Marcus Valerius Corvus (c. 370–270 BC), also sometimes known as Corvinus, was a military commander and politician who served in the early-to-middle period of the Roman Republic. During his career he was elected consul six times, beginning at the age of twenty-three. He was appointed dictator twice and led the armies of the Republic in the First Samnite War. He occupied the curule chair twenty-one times throughout his career. According to legend, he lived to the age of one hundred.

==Early career==
A member of the patrician Valeria, Valerius first came to prominence in 349 BC when he served as a military tribune under the consul Lucius Furius Camillus, who was on campaign against the Gauls of northern Italy. According to tradition, prior to one battle a huge Gallic warrior challenged any Roman to single combat. Valerius, who asked for and gained the consul&#x27;s permission, accepted. As the two approached each other, a raven settled on Valerius&#x27;s helmet and distracted the enemy by flying at his face, allowing Valerius to kill his enemy. The two armies then fought, resulting in a rout of the Gallic forces and a victory for the Romans. As a reward for his courage, Valerius received a gift of ten oxen and a golden crown, as well as the agnomen (the Latin word for &quot;raven&quot;).

Regardless of the story&#x27;s veracity, after this victory Corvus&#x27; popularity soared. He was elected consul &quot;in absentia&quot; in 348 BC at the unusually young age of 22. During his tenure, a treaty was made between Rome and Carthage. In the subsequent year Corvus was likely elected to the office of praetor, followed by his second consulship in 346 BC. On campaign he defeated the Antiates and the Volsci, sacking and destroying the town of Satricum apart from the temple of Mater Matuta. For these victories, the Senate awarded Corvus his first triumph.

==First and Second Samnite Wars==
Corvus served as curule aedile in 345 BC before his military abilities saw his election to the consulship for the third time in 343 BC. That year saw the outbreak of the First Samnite War, in which Corvus won victories at the Battle of Mount Gaurus and the Battle of Suessula. After the latter victory, Corvus had some 40,000 shields and 170 enemy standards piled before him on the battlefield. Corvus then returned to Rome to celebrate his second triumph. He then returned to the southern war front in wintertime to protect Campania from Samnite incursions.

The year 342 BC was one of crisis for the Roman state, with the Roman legions stationed around Capua, as well as the surrounding Campanian towns, rebelling and marching on Rome. In response, Corvus was appointed dictator to deal with the mutineers. Meeting them at the head of an army some eight miles outside of Rome, he negotiated instead of fighting a battle. Using his past association with the army to gain their trust, he reached an agreement. Corvus pushed through laws (the ) which granted the mutinous soldiers immunity from prosecution, prevented the removal of a soldier&#x27;s name from the roll of service without his consent, and prohibited any military tribune being demoted to the rank of centurion. He however refused to agree to the lowering of the rate of pay for the cavalrymen, and to the immediate execution of the decemviri. It was also alleged that, during the troubles that brought about the passage of the , Corvus suggested that the Senate agree to the plebeian demands for the abolition of all debts; this was rejected out of hand. Historians such as Gary Forsythe and S. P. Oakley consider the alleged events of the mutiny to be later literary inventions, although the laws passed in that year are accurate.

Corvus was elected consul for a fourth time in 335 BC, once again in response to an escalating military situation in Italy. The Sidicini had formed an alliance with the Ausones of Cales, and the Senate intended to send someone with a proven military record. In a break with tradition, the consuls did not cast lots for their provinces; the Senate instead assigned the area around Cales directly to Corvus. He successfully besieged and stormed the town; after its capture, the Romans established a colony of 2,500 men. For this victory, Corvus was granted a third triumph, and the honor of carrying the agnomen &quot;Calenus&quot;.

In 332 BC, Corvus was appointed as interrex, a function he again fulfilled in 320 BC. He may also have served as legate under the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor in 325 BC during the Second Samnite War. In 313 BC he was appointed as one of the , who were given the authority to establish a Latin colony at Saticula. In 312 BC he or his son served as consul with Publius Decius Mus as his colleague. Then in 310 BC he was again named a legate under Lucius Papirius Cursor, and fought in a major battle at Longulae against the Samnites. In 308 BC he was elected praetor for the fourth time as a reward for his services at Longulae.

==Later career==
Corvus was appointed dictator for the second time in 302 BC, in response to the revolt of the Marsi at Arretium and Carseoli. Corvus not only defeated the Marsi in battle, but also took the fortified towns of Milionia, Plestina and Fresilia. The Marsi sued for peace, and for his victories over them Corvus was awarded his fourth triumph. He was again appointed dictator in 301 BC, this time to engage in operations against the Etruscans. While Corvus was in Rome taking the auspices, his (probably Marcus Aemilius Paullus) was ambushed by the enemy and forced to retreat to his camp, losing a portion of his army. Corvus, quickly coming to his rescue, engaged and defeated the Etruscans in battle, earning an additional triumph.

300 BC saw Corvus elected consul for the fifth time. During his year in office he defeated some rebel Aequians and was involved in the passage of two laws. The first was the Lex Ogulnia, which resulted in the opening of the College of Pontifices and the College of Augurs to the plebeians. The second, which he legislated himself, was the expansion of the , or right of appeal to the people, which now made illegal the use of severe force (specifically killing or lashing by the higher magistrates) within the city of Rome. Then in the following year (299 BC), after the Senate considered appointing him dictator for the fourth time, Corvus was elected suffect consul after the death of Titus Manlius Torquatus, who was in command of the war with the Etruscans. With Corvus&#x27; arrival, the Etruscans refused to give battle, but remained within their fortified towns. Although Corvus set entire villages on fire to draw them out, the Etruscans refused to engage him.

After his sixth consulship Corvus retired from public life. He died at the age of 100, around the year 270 BC.

==Character and reputation==
A man with considerable military talents, Corvus also possessed a kind and amicable nature. Very popular with the soldiers he led into battle and with whom he shared camps, he reportedly competed with them in the athletic games which they played during their leisure time. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of reform, siding with the plebeians during the ongoing Conflict of the Orders. He held that the changing needs of an expanding state required a readjustment of the opportunities provided to plebeians, for the good of Rome.

To later Roman writers, he served as a memorable example of the favors bestowed by Fortuna. A statue of Corvus stood in the Forum of Augustus alongside the statues of other Roman heroes. Nevertheless, annalist Valerius Antias may have exaggerated his list of accomplishments.
