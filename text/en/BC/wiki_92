<text>The &quot;R&quot;-value is a measure of how well a two-dimensional barrier, such as a layer of insulation, a window or a complete wall or ceiling, resists the conductive flow of heat, in the context of construction. R-value is the temperature difference per unit of heat flux needed to sustain one unit of heat flux between the warmer surface and colder surface of a barrier under steady-state conditions. The measure is therefore equally relevant for lowering energy bills for heating in the winter, for cooling in the summer, and for general comfort.

The &quot;R-value&quot; is the building industry term for thermal resistance &quot;per unit area.&quot; It is sometimes denoted RSI-value if the SI units are used. An R-value can be given for a material (e.g., for polyethylene foam), or for an assembly of materials (e.g., a wall or a window). In the case of materials, it is often expressed in terms of R-value per metre. R-values are additive for layers of materials, and the higher the R-value the better the performance.

The U-factor or U-value is the overall heat transfer coefficient and can be found by taking the inverse of the R-value. It is a property that describes how well building elements conduct heat per unit area across a temperature gradient. The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of materials, such as those that make up the building envelope. It is expressed in watts per square metre kelvin. The higher the U-value, the lower the ability of the building envelope to resist heat transfer. A low U-value, or conversely a high R-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as it is a way of predicting the composite behaviour of an entire building element rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.

==R-value definition==
This relates to the technical/constructional value.
formula_1

where:
* formula_2 (K⋅m2/W) is the R-value, 
* formula_3 (K) is the temperature difference between the warmer surface and colder surface of a barrier, 
* formula_4 (W/m2) is the heat flux through the barrier.

The R-value per unit of a barrier&#x27;s exposed surface area measures the absolute thermal resistance of the barrier.
formula_5

where:
* formula_2 is the R-value (m2⋅K⋅W−1)
* formula_7 is the barrier&#x27;s exposed surface area (m2)
* formula_8 is the absolute thermal resistance (K⋅W−1)

Absolute thermal resistance, formula_8, quantifies the temperature difference per unit of heat flow rate needed to sustain one unit of heat flow rate. Confusion sometimes arises because some publications use the term &quot;thermal resistance&quot; for the temperature difference per unit of heat flux, but other publications use the term &quot;thermal resistance&quot; for the temperature difference per unit of heat flow rate. Further confusion arises because some publications use the character &quot;R&quot; to denote the temperature difference per unit of heat flux, but other publications use the character &quot;R&quot; to denote the temperature difference per unit of heat flow rate. This article uses the term &quot;absolute thermal resistance&quot; for the temperature difference per unit of heat flow rate and uses the term &quot;R-value&quot; for the temperature difference per unit of heat flux.

In any event, the greater the R-value, the greater the resistance, and so the better the thermal insulating properties of the barrier. R-values are used in describing the effectiveness of insulating material and in analysis of heat flow across assemblies (such as walls, roofs, and windows) under steady-state conditions. Heat flow through a barrier is driven by temperature difference between two sides of the barrier, and the R-value quantifies how effectively the object resists this drive: The temperature difference divided by the R-value and then multiplied by the exposed surface area of the barrier gives the &quot;total rate of heat flow through the barrier,&quot; as measured in watts or in BTUs per hour. 
formula_10

where:
* formula_2 is the R-value (K⋅m2/W), 
* formula_3 is the temperature difference (K) between the warmer surface and colder surface of the barrier, 
* formula_7 is the exposed surface area (m2) of the barrier, 
* formula_14 is the heat flow rate (W) through the barrier.
As long as the materials involved are dense solids in direct mutual contact, R-values are additive; for example, the total R-value of a barrier composed of several layers of material is the sum of the R-values of the individual 

For example, in winter it might be 2 °C outside and 20 °C inside, making a temperature difference of 18 °C or 18 K. If the material has an R-value of 4, it will lose 0.25 W/(°C⋅m2). With an area of 100 m2, the heat energy being lost is There will be other losses through the floor, windows, ventilation slots, etc. But for that material alone, 450 W is going out, and can be replaced with a 450 W heater inside, to maintain the inside temperature.

==Usage, units==
Note that the R-value is the building industry term for what is in other contexts called &quot;thermal resistance&quot; &quot;for a unit It is sometimes denoted RSI-value if the SI (metric) units are used.

An R-value can be given for a material (e.g., for polyethylene foam), or for an assembly of materials (e.g., a wall or a window). In the case of materials, it is often expressed in terms of R-value per unit length (e.g., per inch of thickness). The latter can be misleading in the case of low-density building thermal insulations, for which R-values are not additive: their R-value per inch is not constant as the material gets thicker, but rather usually decreases.

The units of an R-value (see below) are usually not explicitly stated, and so it is important to determine from context which units are being used: an R-value expressed in I-P (inch-pound) units is about 5.68 times larger than when expressed in SI units, so that, for example, a window that is R-2 in I-P units has an RSI of 0.35 (since 2/5.68 = 0.35). For R-values there is no difference between US customary units and imperial units.

All of the following mean the same thing: &quot;this is an R-2 window&quot;; &quot;this is an R2 &quot;this window has an R-value of 2&quot;; &quot;this is a window with R = 2&quot; (and similarly with RSI-values, which also include the possibility &quot;this window provides RSI 0.35 of resistance to heat flow&quot;).

==Apparent R-value==
The more a material is intrinsically able to conduct heat, as given by its thermal conductivity, the lower its R-value. On the other hand, the thicker the material, the higher its R-value. Sometimes heat transfer processes &quot;other&quot; than conduction (namely, convection and radiation) significantly contribute to heat transfer within the material. In such cases, it is useful to introduce an &quot;apparent thermal conductivity&quot;, which captures the effects of all three kinds of processes, and to define the R-value more generally as the thickness of a sample divided by its apparent thermal conductivity. Some equations relating this generalized R-value, also known as the apparent R-value, to other quantities are:
formula_15

where:
* formula_16 is the apparent R-value (K/W) across the thickness of the sample,
* formula_17 is the thickness (m) of the sample (measured on a path parallel to the heat flow), 
* formula_18 is the apparent thermal conductivity of the material (W/(K⋅m)),
* formula_19 is the thermal transmittance or &quot;U-value&quot; of the material (W/K),
* formula_20 is the apparent thermal resistivity of the material (K⋅m/W).

An apparent R-value quantifies the physical quantity called thermal insulance.

However, this generalization comes at a price because R-values that include non-conductive processes may no longer be additive and may have significant temperature dependence. In particular, for a loose or porous material, the R-value per inch generally depends on the thickness, almost always so that it decreases with increasing thickness (polyisocyanurate (colloquially, &quot;polyiso&quot;) being an exception; its R-value/inch &quot;increases&quot; with thickness). For similar reasons, the R-value per inch also depends on the temperature of the material, usually increasing with decreasing temperature (polyisocyanurate again being an exception); a nominally R-13 fiberglass batt may be R-14 at and R-12 at . Nevertheless, in construction it is common to treat R-values as independent of temperature. Note that an R-value may not account for radiative or convective processes at the material&#x27;s &quot;surface&quot;, which may be an important factor for some applications.

The R-value is the reciprocal of the thermal transmittance (U-factor) of a material or assembly. The U.S. construction industry prefers to use R-values, however, because they are additive and because bigger values mean better insulation, neither of which is true for U-factors.

==U-factor/U-value==

The &quot;U-factor&quot; or &quot;U-value&quot; is the overall heat transfer coefficient that describes how well a building element conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin W/(m2⋅K). This means that the higher the U-value the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope. A low U-value usually indicates high levels of insulation. They are useful as it is a way of predicting the composite behavior of an entire building element rather than relying on the properties of individual materials.

In most countries the properties of specific materials (such as insulation) are indicated by the thermal conductivity, sometimes called a k-value or lambda-value (lowercase λ). The thermal conductivity (k-value) is the ability of a material to conduct heat; hence, the lower the k-value, the better the material is for insulation. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) has a k-value of around 0.033 W/(m⋅K). For comparison, phenolic foam insulation has a k-value of around 0.018 W/(m⋅K), while wood varies anywhere from 0.15 to 0.75 W/(m⋅K), and steel has a k-value of approximately 50.0 W/(m⋅K). These figures vary from product to product, so the UK and EU have established a 90/90 standard which means that 90% of the product will conform to the stated k-value with a 90% confidence level so long as the figure quoted is stated as the 90/90 lambda-value.

&quot;U&quot; is the inverse of &quot;R&quot; with SI units of W/(m2⋅K) and U.S. units of BTU/(h⋅°F⋅ft2) 
formula_21

where formula_22 is the heat flux, formula_3 is the temperature difference across the material, &quot;k&quot; is the material&#x27;s coefficient of thermal conductivity and &quot;L&quot; is its thickness. In some contexts, &quot;U&quot; is referred to as unit surface conductance.

The term &quot;U-factor&quot; is usually used in the U.S. and Canada to express the heat flow through entire assemblies (such as roofs, walls, and windows). For example, energy codes such as ASHRAE 90.1 and the IECC prescribe U-values. However, R-value is widely used in practice to describe the thermal resistance of insulation products, layers, and most other parts of the building enclosure (walls, floors, roofs). Other areas of the world more commonly use U-value/U-factor for elements of the entire building enclosure including windows, doors, walls, roof, and ground slabs.

==Units: metric (SI) vs. inch-pound (I-P)==

The SI (metric) unit of R-value is 
 kelvin square-metre per watt (K⋅m2/W or, equally, °C⋅m2/W),

whereas the I-P (inch-pound) unit is 
 degree Fahrenheit square-foot hour per British thermal unit (°F⋅ft2⋅h/BTU).

For R-values there is no difference between U.S. and Imperial units, so the same I-P unit is used in both.

Some sources use &quot;RSI&quot; when referring to R-values in SI units.

R-values expressed in I-P units are approximately 5.68 times as large as R-values expressed in SI units. For example, a window that is R-2 in the I-P system is about RSI 0.35, since 2/5.68 ≈ 0.35.

In countries where the SI system is generally in use, the R-values will also normally be given in SI units. This includes the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

I-P values are commonly given in the United States and Canada, though in Canada normally both I-P and RSI values are listed.

Because the units are usually not explicitly stated, one must decide from context which units are being used. In this regard, it helps to keep in mind that I-P R-values are 5.68 times larger than the corresponding SI R-values.

More precisely,

 R-value (in I-P) ≈ RSI-value (in SI) × 5.678263
 RSI-value (in SI) ≈ R-value (in I-P) × 0.1761102

==Different insulation types==
The Australian Government explains that the required total R-values for the building fabric vary depending on climate zone. &quot;Such materials include aerated concrete blocks, hollow expanded polystyrene blocks, straw bales and rendered extruded polystyrene sheets.&quot;

In Germany, after the law Energieeinsparverordnung (EnEv) introduced in 2009 (October 10) regarding energy savings, all new buildings must demonstrate an ability to remain within certain boundaries of the U-value for each particular building material. Further, the EnEv describes the maximum coefficient for each new material if parts are replaced or added to standing structures.

The U.S. Department of Energy has recommended R-values for given areas of the USA based on the general local energy costs for heating and cooling, as well as the climate of an area. There are four types of insulation: rolls and batts, loose-fill, rigid foam, and foam-in-place. Rolls and batts are typically flexible insulators that come in fibers, like fiberglass. Loose-fill insulation comes in loose fibers or pellets and should be blown into a space. Rigid foam is more expensive than fiber, but generally has a higher R-value per unit of thickness. Foam-in-place insulation can be blown into small areas to control air leaks, like those around windows, or can be used to insulate an entire house.

==Thickness==
Increasing the thickness of an insulating layer increases the thermal resistance. For example, doubling the thickness of fiberglass batting will double its R-value, perhaps from 2.0 m2⋅K/W for 110 mm of thickness, up to 4.0 m2⋅K/W for 220 mm of thickness. Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to adding resistance to a series circuit with a fixed voltage. However, this holds only approximately because the effective thermal conductivity of some insulating materials depends on thickness. The addition of materials to enclose the insulation such as drywall and siding provides additional but typically much smaller R-value.

==Factors==
There are many factors that come into play when using R-values to compute heat loss for a particular wall. Manufacturer R-values apply only to properly installed insulation. Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a fiberglass batt decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat conduction path that is unaffected by the insulation&#x27;s R-value. The practical implication of this is that one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50 percent reduction in heat loss. When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the conductive heat loss through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, heat losses due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.

==Primary role==
The R-value is a measure of an insulation sample&#x27;s ability to reduce the rate of heat flow under specified test conditions. The primary mode of heat transfer impeded by insulation is conduction, but insulation also reduces heat loss by all three heat transfer modes: conduction, convection, and radiation. The primary heat loss across an uninsulated air-filled space is natural convection, which occurs because of changes in air density with temperature. Insulation greatly retards natural convection making conduction the primary mode of heat transfer. Porous insulations accomplish this by trapping air so that significant convective heat loss is eliminated, leaving only conduction and minor radiation transfer. The primary role of such insulation is to make the thermal conductivity of the insulation that of trapped, stagnant air. However this cannot be realized fully because the glass wool or foam needed to prevent convection increases the heat conduction compared to that of still air. The minor radiative heat transfer is obtained by having many surfaces interrupting a &quot;clear view&quot; between the inner and outer surfaces of the insulation such as visible light is interrupted from passing through porous materials. Such multiple surfaces are abundant in batting and porous foam. Radiation is also minimized by low emissivity (highly reflective) exterior surfaces such as aluminum foil. Lower thermal conductivity, or higher R-values, can be achieved by replacing air with argon when practical such as within special closed-pore foam insulation because argon has a lower thermal conductivity than air.

== General ==
Heat transfer through an insulating layer is analogous to electrical resistance. The heat transfers can be worked out by thinking of resistance in series with a fixed potential, except the resistances are thermal resistances and the potential is the difference in temperature from one side of the material to the other. The resistance of each material to heat transfer depends on the specific thermal resistance [R-value]/[unit thickness], which is a property of the material (see table below) and the thickness of that layer. A thermal barrier that is composed of several layers will have several thermal resistors in the analogous with circuits, each in series. Analogous to a set of resistors in parallel, a well insulated wall with a poorly insulated window will allow proportionally more of the heat to go through the (low-R) window, and additional insulation in the wall will only minimally improve the overall R-value. As such, the least well insulated section of a wall will play the largest role in heat transfer relative to its size, similar to the way most current flows through the lowest resistance resistor in a parallel array. Hence ensuring that windows, service breaks (around wires/pipes), doors, and other breaks in a wall are well sealed and insulated is often the most cost effective way to improve the insulation of a structure, once the walls are sufficiently insulated.

Like resistance in electrical circuits, increasing the physical length (for insulation, thickness) of a resistive element, such as graphite for example, increases the resistance linearly; double the thickness of a layer means double the R-value and half the heat transfer; quadruple, quarters; etc. In practice, this linear relationship does not always hold for compressible materials such as glass wool and cotton batting whose thermal properties change when compressed. So, for example, if one layer of fiberglass insulation in an attic provides R-20 thermal resistance, adding on a second layer will not necessarily double the thermal resistance because the first layer will be compressed by the weight of the second.

== Calculating heat loss ==
To find the average heat loss per unit area, simply divide the temperature difference by the R-value for the layer.

If the interior of a home is at 20 °C and the roof cavity is at 10 °C then the temperature difference is 10 °C (or 10 K). Assuming a ceiling insulated to RSI 2.0 (R = 2 m2⋅K/W), energy will be lost at a rate of 10 K / (2 K⋅m2/W) = 5 watts for every square meter (W/m) of ceiling. The RSI-value used here is for the actual insulating layer (and not per unit thickness of insulation).

==Relationships==

===Thickness===
R-value should not be confused with the intrinsic property of thermal resistivity and its inverse, thermal conductivity. The SI unit of thermal resistivity is K⋅m/W. Thermal conductivity assumes that the heat transfer of the material is linearly related to its thickness.

===Multiple layers===
In calculating the R-value of a multi-layered installation, the R-values of the individual layers are added:

 R-value(outside air film) + R-value(brick) + R-value(sheathing) + R-value(insulation) + R-value(plasterboard) + R-value(inside air film) = R-value(total).

To account for other components in a wall such as framing, first calculate the U-value (= 1/R-value) of each component, then the area-weighted average U-value. An average R-value is 1/(average U-value). For example, if 10% of the area is 4 inches of softwood (R-value 5.6) and 90% is 2 inches of silica aerogel (R-value 20), the area-weighted U-value is 0.1/5.6 + 0.9/20 ≈ 0.0629 and the weighted R-value is 1/0.0629 ≈ 15.9.

== Controversy ==
=== Thermal conductivity versus apparent thermal conductivity ===
Thermal conductivity is conventionally defined as the rate of thermal conduction through a material per unit area per unit thickness per unit temperature differential (Δ&quot;T&quot;). The inverse of conductivity is resistivity (or R per unit thickness). Thermal conductance is the rate of heat flux through a unit area at the installed thickness and any given Δ&quot;T&quot;.

Experimentally, thermal conduction is measured by placing the material in contact between two conducting plates and measuring the energy flux required to maintain a certain temperature gradient.

For the most part, testing the R-value of insulation is done at a steady temperature, usually about with no surrounding air movement. Since these are ideal conditions, the listed R-value for insulation will almost certainly be higher than it would be in actual use, because most situations with insulation are under different conditions

A definition of R-value based on apparent thermal conductivity has been proposed in document C168 published by the American Society for Testing and Materials. This describes heat being transferred by all three mechanisms—conduction, radiation, and convection.

Debate remains among representatives from different segments of the U.S. insulation industry during revision of the U.S. FTC&#x27;s regulations about advertising R-values illustrating the complexity of the issues.

=== Surface temperature in relationship to mode of heat transfer ===
There are weaknesses to using a single laboratory model to simultaneously assess the properties of a material to resist conducted, radiated, and convective heating. Surface temperature varies depending on the mode of heat transfer.

If we assume idealized heat transfer between the air on each side and the surface of the insulation, the surface temperature of the insulator would equal the air temperature on each side.

In response to thermal radiation, surface temperature depends on the thermal emissivity of the material. Low-emissivity surfaces such as shiny metal foil will reduce heat transfer by radiation.

Convection will alter the rate of heat transfer between the air and the surface of the insulator, depending on the flow characteristics of the air (or other fluid) in contact with it.

With multiple modes of heat transfer, the final surface temperature (and hence the observed energy flux and calculated R-value) will be dependent on the relative contributions of radiation, conduction, and convection, even though the total energy contribution remains the same.

This is an important consideration in building construction because heat energy arrives in different forms and proportions. The contribution of radiative and conductive heat sources also varies throughout the year and both are important contributors to thermal comfort

In the hot season, solar radiation predominates as the source of heat gain. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, radiative heat transfer is related to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (measured in kelvins: &quot;T&quot; [K] = &quot;T&quot; [°C] + 273.16). Therefore, such transfer is at its most significant when the objective is to cool (i.e. when solar radiation has produced very warm surfaces). On the other hand, the conductive and convective heat loss modes play a more significant role during the cooler months. At such lower ambient temperatures the traditional fibrous, plastic and cellulose insulations play by far the major role: the radiative heat transfer component is of far less importance, and the main contribution of the radiation barrier is in its superior air-tightness contribution.
In summary: claims for radiant barrier insulation are justifiable at high temperatures, typically when minimizing summer heat transfer; but these claims are not justifiable in traditional winter (keeping-warm) conditions.

===The limitations of R-values in evaluating radiant barriers===

Unlike bulk insulators, radiant barriers resist conducted heat poorly. Materials such as reflective foil have a high thermal conductivity and would function poorly as a conductive insulator. Radiant barriers retard heat transfer by two means: by reflecting radiant energy away from its irradiated surface and by reducing the emission of radiation from its opposite side.

The question of how to quantify performance of other systems such as radiant barriers has resulted in controversy and confusion in the building industry with the use of R-values or &#x27;equivalent R-values&#x27; for products which have entirely different systems of inhibiting heat transfer. (In the U.S., the federal government&#x27;s R-value rule establishes a legal definition for the R-value of a building material; the term &#x27;equivalent R-value&#x27; has no legal definition and is therefore meaningless.) According to current standards, R-values are most reliably stated for bulk insulation materials. All of the products quoted at the end are examples of these.

Calculating the performance of radiant barriers is more complex. With a good radiant barrier in place, most heat flow is by convection, which depends on many factors other than the radiant barrier itself. Although radiant barriers have high reflectivity (and low emissivity) over a range of electromagnetic spectra (including visible and UV light), their thermal advantages are mainly related to their emissivity in the infra-red range. Emissivity values are the appropriate metric for radiant barriers. Their effectiveness when employed to resist heat gain in limited applications is established,
even though R-value does not adequately describe them.

==Deterioration==

===Insulation aging===
While research is lacking on the long-term degradation of R-value in insulation, recent research indicates that the R-values of products may deteriorate over time. For instance, the compaction of loose-fill cellulose creates voids that reduce overall performance; this may be avoided by densely packing at initial installation. Some types of foam insulation, such as polyurethane and polyisocyanurate are blown into form with heavy gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HFCs). However, over time these gases diffuse out of the foam and are replaced by air, thus reducing the effective R-value of the product. There are other foams which do not change significantly with aging because they are blown with water or are open-cell and contain no trapped CFCs or HFCs (e.g., half-pound low-density foams). On certain brands, twenty-year tests have shown no shrinkage or reduction in insulating value.

This has led to controversy as how to rate the insulation of these products. Many manufacturers will rate the R-value at the time of manufacture; critics argue that a more fair assessment would be its settled value. The foam industry adopted the long-term thermal resistance (LTTR) method, which rates the R-value based on a 15-year weighted average. However, the LTTR effectively provides only an eight-year aged R-value, short in the scale of a building that may have a lifespan of 50 to 100 years.

Research has been conducted by the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center on the long-term degradation of insulating materials. Values on the degradation were obtained from short-term laboratory testing on materials exposed to various temperature and humidity conditions. Results indicate that moisture absorption and loss of blowing agent (in closed-cell spray polyurethane foam) were major causes of R-value loss. Fiberglass and extruded polystyrene retained over 97% of their initial R-values while, aerogels and closed-cell polyurethane saw a reduction of 15% and 27.5%, respectively. Results suggest an exponential decay law over time applies to R-values for closed-cell polyurethanes and aerogel blankets.

===Infiltration===
Correct attention to air sealing measures and consideration of vapor transfer mechanisms are important for the optimal function of bulk insulators. Air infiltration can allow convective heat transfer or condensation formation, both of which may degrade the performance of an insulation.

One of the primary values of spray-foam insulation is its ability to create an airtight (and in some cases, watertight) seal directly against the substrate to reduce the undesirable effects of air leakage. Other construction technologies are also used to reduce or eliminate infiltration such as air sealing techniques.

==R-value in-situ measurements==
The deterioration of R-values is especially a problem when defining the energy efficiency of an existing building. Especially in older or historic buildings the R-values defined before construction might be very different from the actual values. This greatly affects energy efficiency analysis. To obtain reliable data, R-values are therefore often determined via U-value measurements at the specific location (in situ). There are several potential methods to this, each with their specific trade-offs: thermography, multiple temperature measurements, and the heat flux method.

===Thermography===
Thermography is applied in the building sector to assess the quality of the thermal insulation of a room or building. By means of a thermographic camera thermal bridges and inhomogeneous insulation parts can be identified. However, it does not produce any quantitative data. This method can only be used to approximate the U-value or the inverse R-value.

===Multiple temperature measurements===
This approach is based on three or more temperature measurements inside and outside of a building element. By synchronizing these measurements and making some basic assumptions, it is possible to calculate the heat flux indirectly, and thus deriving the U-value of a building element. The following requirements have to be fulfilled for reliable results:

* Difference between inside and outside temperature, ideal &gt; 15 K
* Constant conditions
* No solar radiation
* No radiation heat nearby measurements

===Heat flux method===
The R-value of a building element can be determined by using a heat flux sensor in combination with two temperature sensors. By measuring the heat that is flowing through a building element and combining this with the inside and outside temperature, it is possible to define the R-value precisely. A measurement that lasts at least 72 hours with a temperature difference of at least 5 °C is required for a reliable result according to ISO 9869 norms, but shorter measurement durations give a reliable indication of the R-value as well. The progress of the measurement can be viewed on the laptop via corresponding software and obtained data can be used for further calculations. Measuring devices for such heat flux measurements are offered by companies like FluxTeq, Ahlborn, greenTEG and Hukseflux.

Placing the heat flux sensor on either the inside or outside surface of the building element allows one to determine the heat flux through the heat flux sensor as a representative value for the heat flux through the building element. The heat flux through the heat flux sensor is the rate of heat flow through the heat flux sensor divided by the surface area of the heat flux sensor. Placing the temperature sensors on the inside and outside surfaces of the building element allows one to determine the inside surface temperature, outside surface temperature, and the temperature difference between them. In some cases the heat flux sensor itself can serve as one of the temperature sensors. The R-value for the building element is the temperature difference between the two temperature sensors divided by the heat flux through the heat flux sensor. The mathematical formula is:
formula_24

where:
* formula_2 is the R-value (K⋅W−1⋅m2),
* formula_4 is the heat flux (W⋅m−2),
* formula_7 is the surface area of the heat flux sensor (m2),
* formula_28 is the rate of heat flow (W),
* formula_29 is the inside surface temperature (K),
* formula_30 is the outside surface temperature (K), and 
* formula_3 is the temperature difference (K) between the inside and outside surfaces.

The U-value can be calculated as well by taking the reciprocal of the R-value. That is,
formula_32

where formula_19 is the U-value (W⋅m−2⋅K−1).

The derived R-value and U-value may be accurate to the extent that the heat flux through the heat flux sensor equals the heat flux through the building element. Recording all of the available data allows one to study the dependence of the R-value and U-value on factors like the inside temperature, outside temperature, or position of the heat flux sensor. To the extent that all heat transfer processes (conduction, convection, and radiation) contribute to the measurements, the derived R-value represents an apparent R-value.

==Sample values==

Vacuum insulated panels have the highest R-value, approximately R-45 (in U.S. units) per inch; aerogel has the next highest R-value (about R-10 to R-30 per inch), followed by polyurethane (PUR) and phenolic foam insulations with R-7 per inch. They are followed closely by polyisocyanurate (PIR) at R-5.8, graphite impregnated expanded polystyrene at R-5, and expanded polystyrene (EPS) at R-4 per inch. Loose cellulose, fibreglass (both blown and in batts), and rock wool (both blown and in batts) all possess an R-value of roughly R-2.5 to R-4 per inch.

Straw bales perform at about R-2.38 to 2.68 per inch, depending on orientation of the bales. However, typical straw bale houses have very thick walls and thus are well insulated. Snow is roughly R-1 per inch. Brick has a very poor insulating ability at a mere R-0.2 per inch; however it does have a relatively good thermal mass.

Note that the above examples all use the U.S. (non-SI) definition for R-value.

=== Typical R-values ===
=== Typical R-values for surfaces ===

==== Non-reflective surface R-values for air films ====
When determining the overall thermal resistance of a building assembly such as a wall or roof, the insulating effect of the surface air film is added to the thermal resistance of the other materials.
In practice the above surface values are used for floors, ceilings, and walls in a building, but are not accurate for enclosed air cavities, such as between panes of glass. The effective thermal resistance of an enclosed air cavity is strongly influenced by radiative heat transfer and distance between the two surfaces. See insulated glazing for a comparison of R-values for windows, with some effective R-values that include an air cavity.

==== Radiant barriers ====
=== &quot;R-value rule&quot; in the U.S. ===
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) governs claims about R-values to protect consumers against deceptive and misleading advertising claims. It issued the R-value rule.

The primary purpose of the rule is to ensure that the home insulation marketplace provides this essential pre-purchase information to the consumer. The information gives consumers an opportunity to compare relative insulating efficiencies, to select the product with the greatest efficiency and potential for energy savings, to make a cost-effective purchase and to consider the main variables limiting insulation effectiveness and realization of claimed energy savings.

The rule mandates that specific R-value information for home insulation products be disclosed in certain ads and at the point of sale. The purpose of the R-value disclosure requirement for advertising is to prevent consumers from being misled by certain claims which have a bearing on insulating value. At the point of transaction, some consumers will be able to get the requisite R-value information from the label on the insulation package. However, since the evidence shows that packages are often unavailable for inspection prior to purchase, no labeled information would be available to consumers in many instances. As a result, the Rule requires that a fact sheet be available to consumers for inspection before they make their purchase.

<text>The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a 22-story, steel-framed triangular building at 175 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Designed by Daniel Burnham and Frederick P. Dinkelberg, and sometimes called, in its early days, &quot;Burnham&#x27;s Folly&quot;, it was opened in 1902. The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street—where the building&#x27;s back end is located—with East 23rd Street grazing the triangle&#x27;s northern (uptown) peak. The name &quot;Flatiron&quot; derives from its triangular shape, which recalls that of a cast-iron clothes iron.

The Flatiron Building was developed as the headquarters of construction firm Fuller Company, which acquired the site from the Newhouse family in May 1901. Construction proceeded rapidly, and the building opened on October 1, 1902. Originally 20 floors, a &quot;cowcatcher&quot; retail space (a low attached building so called for its resemblance to the device on rail locomotives) and penthouse were added shortly after the building&#x27;s opening. The Fuller Company sold the building in 1925 to an investment syndicate. The Equitable Life Assurance Society took over the building after a foreclosure auction in 1933 and sold it to another syndicate in 1945. Helmsley-Spear managed the building for much of the late 20th century, renovating it several times. The Newmark Group started managing the building in 1997. Ownership was divided among several companies, which started renovating the building again in 2019. Jacob Garlick agreed to acquire the Flatiron Building at an auction in early 2023, but failed to pay the required deposit, and three of the four existing ownership groups took over the building. In October 2023, the building&#x27;s owners announced that it would be converted to residential condominiums; the project is planned to be complete by 2026.

The Flatiron Building&#x27;s facade is divided vertically into three sections, similarly to the components of a classical column. The three-story base is clad with limestone, while the upper stories are clad with glazed terracotta. The building&#x27;s steel frame, designed by structural engineering firm Purdy and Henderson, was intended to withstand four times the maximum wind force of the area. Called &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most iconic skyscrapers and a quintessential symbol of New York City&quot;, the building anchors the south (downtown) end of Madison Square and the north (uptown) end of the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District. The neighborhood around it is called the Flatiron District after its signature, iconic building. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989. A survey in 2023 found that the Flatiron Building was the fourth-most-loved building in the United States.

== Site ==
The Flatiron Building occupies a triangular city block bounded by Fifth Avenue to the west, Broadway to the east, and 22nd Street to the south. The western and eastern facades converge, forming a &quot;peak&quot; at its northern corner where Fifth Avenue and Broadway intersect with East 23rd Street. The shape of the site arises from Broadway&#x27;s diagonal alignment relative to the Manhattan street grid. The site measures on Fifth Avenue, on Broadway, and on 22nd Street. Above the ground level, all three corners of the triangle are rounded. Despite the building&#x27;s name, the site is shaped like a scalene right triangle, rather than an isosceles triangle (as flatirons are shaped).

Adjacent buildings include the Toy Center to the north, the Sohmer Piano Building to the southwest, the Scribner Building to the south, and Madison Green to the southeast. Entrances to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 23rd Street station, served by the , are adjacent to the building. The Flatiron Building is at the northern end of the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District, which extends between 15th Street to the south and 24th Street to the north. By the 1990s, the blocks south of the building had also become known as the Flatiron District.

=== Previous structures ===
The St. Germain Hotel (alternatively spelled St. Germaine) was built by 1855 on the south end of the lot. It was one of several hotels built in the neighborhood during the mid-19th century. Amos Eno purchased the entire block in 1857 for $32,000, and he shortly built the Fifth Avenue Hotel on a site diagonally across from it. At some point after 1880, Eno tore down the St. Germain Hotel and replaced it with a seven-story apartment building, the Cumberland. On the remainder of the lot, he built four three-story buildings for commercial use. This left four stories of the Cumberland&#x27;s northern face exposed, which Eno rented out to advertisers, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which installed a sign made up of electric lights. The sign, the first of its kind in New York City, was a precursor to the Great White Way near Times Square. Eno later put a canvas screen on the wall, projecting images from a magic lantern atop one of his smaller buildings, where he alternately presented advertisements and interesting pictures. Both the &quot;Times&quot; and the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; began using the screen for news bulletins, and on election nights tens of thousands of people would gather in Madison Square, waiting for the latest results.

The site came to be known by many names, including &quot;Eno&#x27;s flatiron&quot;, &quot;Eno&#x27;s corner&quot;, and &quot;the cow catcher&quot;. By the 1890s, the Eno family earned $42,000 a year from the site. Although Eno was one of the largest landowners in New York City by 1894, he rejected all offers to purchase the flatiron site during his lifetime. After his death in 1899, his assets were liquidated, and the lot went up for sale. The New York State Assembly appropriated $3 million for the city to buy it, but this fell through when a newspaper reporter discovered that the plan was a graft scheme by Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker. Instead, the lot was bought at auction by William Eno, one of Amos&#x27;s sons, for $690,000 in April 1899. This was more than 20 times what the elder Eno had paid for the property four decades earlier.

In May 1899, just three weeks after William had acquired the flatiron lot, he resold it to Samuel and Mott Newhouse for $750,000 or around $801,000. At the time, the Newhouse family did not consider a skyscraper on the flatiron site to be feasible because of engineering and architectural constraints. The Newhouses intended to erect a 12-story building with retail shops at street level and bachelor apartments above. They announced plans for the building in November 1900, but the plans were not executed, even though the value of land lots in the city was increasing. At the time, eight- to ten-story office and commercial buildings were being developed in the neighborhood, replacing older, shorter commercial structures.

== History ==
At the beginning of March 1901, media outlets reported that the Newhouse family was planning to sell &quot;Eno&#x27;s flatiron&quot; for about $2 million to Cumberland Realty Company, an investment partnership created by Harry S. Black, CEO of the Fuller Company. The Fuller Company was the first true general contractor that dealt with all aspects of buildings&#x27; construction (except for design), and they specialized in erecting skyscrapers. They were particularly experienced in designing towers on small sites, such as the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings in Lower Manhattan. Black intended to construct a new headquarters building on the site, despite the recent deterioration of the surrounding neighborhood. At the end of that March, the Fuller Company organized a subsidiary to develop a building on the site. The sale was finalized in May 1901.

=== Development ===
==== Plans and site-clearing ====
Black hired Daniel Burnham&#x27;s architectural firm to design a 21-story building on the site in February 1901. It would be Burnham&#x27;s first in New York City, the tallest building in Manhattan north of the Financial District, and the first skyscraper north of Union Square (at 14th Street). The Northwestern Salvage and Wrecking Company began razing the site in May 1901, after the majority of existing tenants&#x27; leases had expired. Most of the Cumberland&#x27;s remaining tenants readily vacated the building in exchange for monetary compensation. The sole holdout was Winfield Scott Proskey, a retired colonel who refused to move out until his lease expired later that year. Cumberland Realty unsuccessfully attempted to deactivate Proskey&#x27;s water and gas supply, and Proskey continued to live in the Cumberland while contractors demolished all of the surrounding apartments. By the end of May 1901, Cumberland Realty discovered that Proskey was bankrupt, and his creditors took over the lease and razed the rest of the Cumberland that June.

The &quot;New York Herald&quot; published an image of the site on June 2, 1901, with the caption &quot;Flatiron Building&quot;. The project&#x27;s structural engineer, Corydon Purdy, filed plans for a 20-story building on the site that August. The Flatiron Building was not the first building of its triangular ground-plan, although it was the largest at the time of its completion. Earlier buildings with a similar shape include a triangular Roman temple built on a similarly constricted site in the city of Verulamium, Britannia; Bridge House, Leeds, England (1875); the I.O.O.F. Centennial Building (1876) in Alpena, Michigan; and the English-American Building in Atlanta (1897). The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; published a drawing of the building in October 1901; though the drawing was captioned &quot;The Cumberland&quot;, it was very similar to the Flatiron Building&#x27;s final design.

==== Construction ====
The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company began producing architectural terracotta pieces for the building in August 1901. Around the same time, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) indicated that it would refuse to approve Purdy&#x27;s initial plans unless the engineers submitted detailed information about the framework, fireproofing, and wind-bracing systems. Purdy complied with most of the DOB&#x27;s requests, submitting detailed drawings and documents, but he balked at the department&#x27;s requirement that the design include fire escapes. For reasons that are unclear, the DOB dropped its requirement that the building contain fire escapes. In addition, the building was originally legally required to contain metal-framed windows, although this would have increased the cost of construction. The city&#x27;s Board of Building Commissioners had granted an exemption to Black&#x27;s syndicate, prompting allegations of favoritism. A new Buildings Department commissioner was appointed at the beginning of 1902, promising to enforce city building codes; this prompted general contractor Thompson–Starrett Co. to announce that the building&#x27;s window frames would be made of fireproof wood with a copper coating.

The building&#x27;s steel frame was manufactured by the American Bridge Company in Pennsylvania. The frame had risen above street level by January 1902. Construction was then halted for several weeks, first because of a delay in steel shipments, then because of a blizzard that occurred in February. Further delays were caused by a strike at the factory of Hecla Iron Works, which was manufacturing elevators and handrails for the building. The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the steel pieces could be connected &quot;without so much as the alteration of a bored hole, or the exchange of a tiny rivet&quot;. Workers used air-powered tools to rivet the steel beams together, since such equipment was more efficient than steam-powered tools at conducting power over long distances. The frame was complete by February 1902, and workers began installing the terracotta tiles as the framework of the top stories was being finished. By mid-May, the building was half-covered by terracotta tiling. The terracotta work was completed the next month, and the scaffolding in front of the building was removed. The Fifth Avenue Building Company had invested $1.5 million in the project.

Officials of the Fuller Company announced in August 1902 that the structure would be officially named after George A. Fuller, founder of the Fuller Company and &quot;father of the skyscraper&quot;, who had died two years earlier. By then, the site had been known as the &quot;flatiron&quot; for several years; according to Christopher Gray of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Burnham&#x27;s and Fuller&#x27;s architectural drawings even labeled the structure as the &quot;Flatiron Building&quot;. Although the Fuller name was used for some time after the building&#x27;s completion, locals persisted in calling it the Flatiron, to the displeasure of Harry Black and the building&#x27;s contractors. In subsequent years, the edifice officially came to be known as the Flatiron Building, and the Fuller name was transferred to a newer 40-story structure at 597 Madison Avenue.

=== Fuller Company ownership ===
In the weeks before the official opening, the Fuller Company distributed six-page brochures to potential tenants and real-estate brokers. The brochures advertised the building as being &quot;ready for occupancy&quot; on October 1, 1902. The Fuller Company took the 19th floor for its headquarters. When completed, the Flatiron Building was much taller than others in the neighborhood; when New York City Fire Department officials tested the building&#x27;s standpipes in November 1902, they found that &quot;the &#x27;flat-iron&#x27; building would be of great aid in fighting the fire&quot; in any surrounding buildings. It was the seventh-tallest building in Manhattan, behind the Park Row Building, Manhattan Life Insurance Building, St. Paul Building, American Surety Building, American Tract Building, and Empire Building. Following the building&#x27;s completion, the surrounding neighborhood evolved from an entertainment district to a commercial hub. Initially, the building was topped by a flagpole, which was maintained by one man, &quot;Steeplejack&quot; Kay, for four decades. Henry Clay Frick expressed interest in purchasing the structure in 1904 for $5 million, but he ultimately withdrew his offer.

==== Modifications ====
During the building&#x27;s construction, Black had suggested that the &quot;cowcatcher&quot; retail space be installed at the northern tip of the building, occupying of unused space at the extreme northern end of the lot. This would maximize use of the building&#x27;s lot and produce some retail income. Burnham initially refused to consider Black&#x27;s suggestion, and, in April 1902, Black asked a draftsman at the Fuller Company to draw up plans for the retail space. Black submitted plans for the annex to the DOB in May 1902. The DOB rejected the initial plans because the walls were too thin, but the department approved a revised proposal that June, to Burnham&#x27;s disapproval. The retail space in the &quot;cowcatcher&quot; was leased by United Cigar Stores.

Another addition to the building not in the original plan was the penthouse, which was constructed after the rest of the building had been completed. By 1905, the Fuller Company needed to expand its technical drawing facilities. As a result, the company filed plans for a penthouse with the New York City Department of Buildings that March. The penthouse would cost $10,000 and would include fireproof partitions and a staircase from the existing 20th floor. The penthouse, intended for use as artists&#x27; studios, was quickly rented out to artists such as Louis Fancher, many of whom contributed to the pulp magazines which were produced in the offices below.

==== Early tenants ====
Besides the Fuller Company, the Flatiron&#x27;s other original tenants included publishers such as magazine publishing pioneer Frank Munsey, &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot;, and a vanity publisher. An insurance company, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, leased nearly the entire third floor. Small businesses also occupied the Flatiron, including a patent medicine company; the Western Specialty Manufacturing Company; and Whitehead &amp; Hoag, which made celluloid novelties. Other tenants included an overflow of music publishers from &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; on 28th Street; a landscape architect; the Imperial Russian Consulate, which took up three floors; the New York State Athletic Commission; the Bohemian Guides Society; the Roebling Construction Company, owned by the sons of Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker; and the crime syndicate Murder, Inc. The puppeteer Tony Sarg had a studio in the Flatiron Building during the 1910s. Harry Black moved the Fuller Company&#x27;s offices in 1911 to the Trinity Building at 111 Broadway, where its parent company, U.S. Realty, had its offices. U.S. Realty moved its offices back to the Flatiron in 1916.

The building&#x27;s vast cellar extended into the vaults that went more than under the surrounding streets. Initial plans called for a ratskeller to be opened within the vaults, but Manhattan borough president Jacob A. Cantor had objected to the plans. Ultimately, part of the basement was occupied by the Flatiron Restaurant, which could seat 1,500 patrons and was open from breakfast through late supper for those taking in a performance at one of the many theatres which lined Broadway between 14th and 23rd Streets. In the building&#x27;s early years, sightseeing buses would bring visitors to the Flatiron Restaurant and to the 21st-story observation deck. In 1911, the building introduced a restaurant/club in the basement. It was among the first of its kind that allowed a black jazz band to perform, thus introducing ragtime to affluent New Yorkers.

Even before construction on the Flatiron Building had begun, the area around Madison Square had started to deteriorate somewhat. After U.S. Realty constructed the New York Hippodrome, Madison Square Garden was no longer the venue of choice, and survived largely by staging boxing matches. The base of the Flatiron became a cruising spot for gay men, including some male prostitutes. Nonetheless, in 1911 the Flatiron Restaurant was bought by Louis Bustanoby, of the well-known Café des Beaux-Arts, and converted into a trendy 400-seat French restaurant, Taverne Louis. As an innovation to attract customers from another restaurant opened by his brothers, Bustanoby hired a black musical group, Louis Mitchell and his Southern Symphony Quintette, to play dance tunes at the Taverne and the Café. Irving Berlin heard the group at the Taverne and suggested that they should try to get work in London, which they did. The Taverne also welcomed a gay clientele, which then was unusual for a restaurant of its type. The Taverne was forced to close after Prohibition negatively impacted restaurant business.

When the U.S. entered World War I, the Federal government instituted a &quot;Wake Up America!&quot; campaign, and the United Cigar store in the Flatiron&#x27;s cowcatcher donated its space to the U.S. Navy for use as a recruiting center. Liberty Bonds were sold outside on sidewalk stands.

===Rosenbaum and Equitable ownership===

In March 1925, Black agreed to sell the Flatiron Building to a syndicate led by Lewis Rosenbaum, which also owned numerous other notable buildings around the U.S. Although the sale price was not revealed, the building was valued at $2 million, about the same as what Black had paid to buy the lot and erecting the Flatiron. The syndicate paid $500,000 in cash and covered the remainder of the purchase price with a long-term mortgage; the transaction provided cash for the financially struggling U.S. Realty Company. Many pottery, glassware, and china firms leased space for display firms within the Flatiron Building through the late 1920s. Additionally, drug-store chain Walgreens opened a store within the &quot;cowcatcher&quot; space in 1927, replacing the United Cigar store. By then, many businesses were moving farther northward, including the Fuller Company, which left permanently for the Fuller Building on Madison Avenue in 1929. The Flatiron&#x27;s operating costs were increasing, and its income decreased greatly with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. The Flatiron had long since been surpassed in height by other structures, and its roof was &quot;of interest chiefly for its historic associations&quot;.

The Equitable Life Assurance Society sued to foreclose upon the building&#x27;s mortgage in March 1933 after the owners defaulted on mortgage payments. The mortgage had an unpaid principal of more than $1 million, and the owners had not paid interest in more than a year. The building was placed for sale at a foreclosure auction, and Equitable acquired the building on June 30 for $100,000, submitting the only bid at the auction. To attract tenants, Equitable upgraded some parts of the building in 1941. The original cast-iron birdcage elevators, which consisted of rubber-tiled cabs built by Hecla Iron Works, were replaced with enclosed cabs; however, the hydraulic power system remained in place. In addition, the lobby&#x27;s open grillwork partitions were replaced with marble partitions. The building&#x27;s heat, light, and elevators were maintained by a team of eight engineers, who sometimes went on strike.

By the mid-1940s, the building was fully rented, and clothing and toy companies took up much of the space. In addition, the building was occupied by firms such as a paper company, an advertiser, and &quot;Baseball Magazine&quot;.

=== Helmsley-Spear management ===
Equitable sold the building in October 1945 to an investment syndicate led by lawyer Max Silverstein; at the time, the structure was valued at $1.05 million. Harry Helmsley&#x27;s firm Dwight-Helmsley (later Helmsley-Spear) brokered the sale and continued to manage the property. By 1946, the partnership of Flatiron Associates owned the building, and Dwight-Helmsley owned a minority stake in the partnership. The new owners made some superficial changes in the early 1950s, such as adding a dropped ceiling to the lobby and replacing the original mahogany-paneled entrances with revolving doors. After architect George C. Rudolph remodeled the main entrance, the 23rd Street Association gave Dwight-Helmsley an award in 1953, recognizing the firm&#x27;s &quot;contribution to the development of the Twenty-third Street area&quot;. By then, the surrounding area had become largely industrial, with many companies in the publishing, clothing, toy, and manufacturing industries.

In 1959, St. Martin&#x27;s Press moved into the building, and gradually its parent company, Macmillan, rented other offices as they became available. During its tenancy, Macmillan renovated some of the Flatiron Building&#x27;s floors for its imprints such as Tor/Forge, Picador and Henry Holt and Company. St. Martin&#x27;s Press president Thomas McCormack had an office within the building&#x27;s prow. According to McCormack, the company&#x27;s authors were &quot;fascinated&quot; by the building; he said it was &quot;the only office I know of where you can stand in one place and see the East River, the Hudson and Central Park without moving&quot;. Macmillan wrote about the building:

The Flatiron&#x27;s interior is known for having its strangely-shaped offices with walls that cut through at an angle on their way to the skyscraper&#x27;s famous point. These &quot;point&quot; offices are the most coveted and feature amazing northern views that look directly upon another famous Manhattan landmark, the Empire State Building.

The Helmsley/Flatiron Associates ownership structure was a tenancy-in-common, in which all co-owners had to agree on any action, as opposed to a straightforward partnership, in which only a majority of co-owners needed to agree. Hence, it was difficult to get permission for necessary repairs and improvements, and the building declined during the Helmsley/Flatiron Associates era. The surrounding neighborhood declined for several decades, and many of the area&#x27;s longtime commercial tenants had started to move out. An &quot;anonymous-looking importing firm&quot; occupied the &quot;cowcatcher&quot; retail space, for which there was relatively little demand. The 21st floor and several stories below it were slightly damaged during a fire in 1972. By the late 1980s, one broker said that &quot;the elevators are bad and the facade is dirty&quot; at the Flatiron Building; in particular, there was graffiti across the base, while the rest of the facade was covered in soot. Several of Helmsley&#x27;s other buildings were similarly rundown.

The facade of the Flatiron Building was restored in 1991 by the firm of Hurley &amp; Farinella. As part of the project, the lobby was renovated, and the terracotta details were also repaired. In addition, C.P. Company leased the ground floor and renovated the space into a clothing store, which opened in February 1991. Bentley LaRosa Salasky designed the store&#x27;s facade, while Cordero Progetti redesigned the interior, exposing the columns at the building&#x27;s prow. The surrounding neighborhood&#x27;s reputation had started to improve, and all of the Flatiron Building&#x27;s space was under lease. Numerous publishing firms relocated to the area in the late 20th century, and, by the early 1990s, the building&#x27;s two largest tenants were publishing firms. St. Martin&#x27;s Press renewed its lease for ten stories of the building in 1993, with an option to expand into smaller tenants&#x27; space when their leases expired. Simultaneously, Springer–Verlag renewed its lease for six stories and secured an option for four additional stories. The C.P. Company store only operated until 1996.

=== Newmark management and split ownership ===
By 1995, some of the partners at Flatiron Associates wanted to hire real-estate firm Newmark &amp; Company to replace Helmsley-Spear as the property&#x27;s managing agent. The dissenting co-owners claimed that Helmsley-Spear was overpaying for elevator maintenance and cleaning. However, the Helmsley family owned a stake in the building, and, because of the tenancy-in-common ownership structure, could block the other owners&#x27; attempts to hire Newmark. In 1997, some of the investors sold their 52 percent stake in the building to Newmark, which replaced Helmsley-Spear as the building&#x27;s managing agent. Shortly after Helmsley&#x27;s death in January 1997, Helmsley&#x27;s widow, Leona Helmsley, also sold her ownership stake in the building. Newmark made significant improvements to the property, including installing new electric elevators, replacing the antiquated cabs, which were the last hydraulic elevators in New York City.

==== Macmillan expansion and conversion proposals ====
The Flatiron Building was popular among service companies in the early 2000s, causing rental rates at surrounding buildings to increase. The rent increases occurred amid the gentrification of the surrounding area. By then, St. Martin&#x27;s Press and Springer–Verlag collectively occupied 90 percent of the space; some of the remaining small tenants had moved away because rents at the Flatiron were too expensive. Macmillan&#x27;s parent company Holtzbrinck Publishing Group leased additional space in the building in 2004, expanding its presence from 12 to 18 floors. In addition, Holtzbrinck bought an option to lease the two remaining office stories. The building&#x27;s owners had contemplated converting the building into apartments, but, after Holtzbrinck leased most of the space, the owners instead decided to restore the building&#x27;s historical details. A 15-story vertical advertising banner covered the facade of the building in 2005, during the renovation, but it was removed after protests from many New York City residents.

Italian real estate investment firm The Sorgente Group bought a majority stake in the Flatiron Building in June 2008; it had previously owned less than 20 percent of the building. The following January, Sorgente announced plans to turn it into a luxury hotel. The value of the Flatiron Building, whose zoning allowed a hotel conversion, was estimated to be $190 million. Jeffrey Gural, chairman of Newmark, sold a stake in the building to the Sorgente Group in November 2009 for $51.8 million, although Gural and several partners still owned part of the building. Afterward, Sorgente owned a 52 percent stake in the building, while various real estate families owned the remaining stake. By 2010, Macmillan occupied all of the building&#x27;s space, except for the ground floor.

The hotel conversion plans were hampered by the fact that Macmillan&#x27;s existing lease did not expire until 2018. In a 2010 interview, Veronica Mainetti, who led the Sorgente Group&#x27;s United States division, did not indicate whether Sorgente still planned to convert the building into a hotel. Mainetti subsequently said in 2015 that, when Macmillan&#x27;s lease expired, &quot;There possibly is going to be an upgrade and the building could make also a good potential hotel conversion, which we&#x27;re not completely taking off the table.&quot; Due to high demand for office space, the building&#x27;s value increased 30 percent from 2009 to 2013, when it was worth between $250 million and $300 million. In July 2017, Macmillan announced it was consolidating its New York offices to the Equitable Building at 120 Broadway. Knotel, an operator of coworking spaces, subsequently announced in January 2019 that it wanted to lease all of the building&#x27;s office space. The Knotel agreement was never finalized.

====2010s and 2020s renovation====
By June 2019, Macmillan had left the building, and all 21 office floors were vacant. GFP Real Estate announced that it would upgrade the building&#x27;s interior, since the structure would be almost completely vacant, except for a T-Mobile store at the base. GFP planned to install a central air and heating system, strip away all interior partitions, put in a new sprinkler system and a second staircase, upgrade the elevators, and renovate the lobby for $60–80 million. The project was estimated to take a year. The owners were interested in renting the entire building to a single tenant, hiring a high-profile real estate agency to find a suitable tenant. The executive director of the ownership company said: &quot;The building was born as a commercial property, and we want to keep it as such.&quot; The building was empty by November 2020, and the full renovation was expected to last for at least two more years.

The full renovation was delayed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. By 2021, four of the building&#x27;s five co-owners wished to sell off their combined ownership stakes due to disputes over the renovation. A New York state judge ruled in June 2022 that the four co-owners could buy out the stake of the fifth co-owner, Nathan Royce Silverstein, who owned a 25 percent stake in the building and was in disagreement with the other co-owners. According to Jeffrey Gural, Silverstein had first wanted to find a new tenant without renovating the building. Silverstein then suggested dividing the Flatiron Building into five physically separate properties, which according to Gural was infeasible for several reasons, including the fact that it was landmarked. Silverstein, by contrast, claimed that the building&#x27;s renovation costs were being inflated.

===Sale and conversion===

==== First auction ====
In March 2023, a New York Supreme Court judge ordered that the Flatiron Building be put up for sale at a public auction. The sale was announced after the owners had failed to settle their differences regarding the building&#x27;s renovation. An opening bid of $40,000 was announced; the auction, which took place on March 22, 2023, was open for anyone to bid. It was reported that the majority owners – GFP Real Estate, Newmark, and ABS Real Estate, which collectively own 75% of the building – wished to hold on to the building. The building was ultimately sold for $190 million to a 31-year-old man, Jacob Garlick, who beat out the previous owners. After the auction, Garlick – who owned a venture-capital firm, Abraham Trust, for which there was no contact information available – said that owning the Flatiron Building had been &quot;a lifelong dream of mine since I&#x27;m 14 years old ... I&#x27;ve worked every day of my life to be in this position&quot;.

For the sale to be finalized, Garlick had to make a 10 percent down payment of $19 million by the close of day on March 24, but Garlick failed to do so, causing some confusion about what would happen next. According to Jeffrey Gural, who came in second in the bidding, immediately after the auction on the steps of the New York County Courthouse, Garlick asked him if he wanted to partner in the building, later offering a 10% stake in return for putting up the $19 million down payment. After Garlick missed the deadline for the down payment, the building was offered to Gural at $189.5 million, $500,000 less than Garlick&#x27;s bid (bidding at the end of the auction was made in half-million dollar increments). Three of the building&#x27;s current owners passed on their option to buy the building for that amount. A bankruptcy expert noted that bidders at the auction were not required to provide a deposit before bidding, which they said was &quot;highly unorthodox&quot; at such events. Because the runner-up passed on the option to buy the building, a new auction was required, though Garlick was still responsible for the missed $19 million down payment.

Real-estate publications noted in mid-April that Garlick is a &quot;distant relative&quot; of current co-owner Nathan Silverstein and that Garlick&#x27;s purpose in bidding may have been to push up the purchase price so that Silverstein would receive a larger payout from the auction, though &quot;The Real Deal&quot; found no evidence of collusion. Garlick still maintained that he wanted to buy the building, both the auctioneer and the court-appointed referee denied any awareness of Garlick&#x27;s intent, and the court-appointed referee for the auction said that Garlick had defaulted and could no longer purchase the building. On May 5, the majority owners, led by Gural, sued Garlick and his investment firm, Abraham Trust, claiming that his bid was fraudulent. Also in May 2023, city officials approached the building&#x27;s owners amid the New York City migrant housing crisis, seeking to use the building as shelter space. Since the building had been gutted, and there were no bathrooms, Gural rejected the request.

==== Second auction and residential conversion ====
A second auction was scheduled for May 23, 2023, after Gural and his partners declined to exercise their option to buy the building for $189.5 million. It was reported that prospective bidders would be required to have a check for $100,000 on hand in order to participate. In the second auction on May 23, the majority owners group, composed of Gural, Newmark, Sorgente Group, and ABS Partners, purchased full control of the building with a winning bid of $161 million. Garlick was not a bidder. Gural and his partners announced plans to convert all or part of the building to residences; they needed a permit from the city to proceed with the conversion. Daniel Brodsky&#x27;s Brodsky Organization bought a stake in the building in October 2023 and announced that, in partnership with GFP and Sorgente, he would convert the structure to residential condominiums. 

In August 2024, the building&#x27;s developers filed plans to convert the stories above the ground floor into 60 condos; the conversion was planned to be completed in 2026. The next month, Brodsky applied for a zoning variance from the city government, which would allow the building to be converted to residences. Under the existing zoning, no more than half of the building could be used for residential purposes. That October, Brodsky and his partners received a $357 million loan for the building&#x27;s renovation from Tyko Capital.

==Architecture==
The Flatiron Building was designed by Chicago architect Daniel Burnham as a vertical Renaissance palazzo with Beaux-Arts styling. Unlike New York&#x27;s early skyscrapers, which took the form of towers arising from a lower, blockier mass, such as the contemporary Singer Building (completed in 1908), the Flatiron Building was designed in the style of the Chicago school. The palazzo-style design was intended to reassure passersby by giving an appearance of strength. Filling its entire land lot, the building was constructed as a slab without any setbacks. Originally, the structure was tall, with 20 stories and an attic. After an expansion in 1905, the building stood tall, with 22 stories; if the attic is excluded, the expanded building only contains 21 stories. Some sources mistakenly describe the building as one of the world&#x27;s first skyscrapers or steel-framed buildings.

Though Burnham maintained overall control of the design process, he was not directly connected with the details of the structure as built. That task was performed by his designer Frederick P. Dinkelberg, a Pennsylvania-born architect in Burnham&#x27;s office. The men had worked together since the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. It is unknown where the working drawings for the Flatiron Building are stored, though renderings were published at the time of construction in &quot;The American Architect&quot; and &quot;Architectural Record&quot;.

=== Facade ===
Similar to the parts of a classical Greek column, the Flatiron Building&#x27;s facade is divided into a base, shaft, and capital. The Fifth Avenue and Broadway elevations of the facade are both eighteen bays wide, while the 22nd Street elevation is eight bays wide; the bays are arranged in pairs. The southwest and southeast corners are curved, with one rounded window on each story above the base. In addition, each story of the curved prow on 23rd Street contains three sash windows; the central window is wider than the other two. Many of the Flatiron Building&#x27;s tenants referred to the prow as &quot;the Point&quot;.

The facade of the three-story base is made of limestone. Each of the openings at the base is two bays wide. There are entrances on either end of the 22nd Street elevation, as well as at the centers of the Fifth Avenue and Broadway elevations. Above the base, the facade is made of glazed terracotta from the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company in Tottenville, Staten Island. The building also contains decorative details such as cornices, moldings, and oriel windows. These materials were intended to give the impression of &quot;general unity in treatment&quot;, while also giving the facade a textured appearance. Early sketches by Daniel Burnham show an unexecuted clock face and a far more elaborate crown than was ultimately built.

==== Base ====
At ground level, the entrances on Fifth Avenue and Broadway are each flanked by four storefront windows to the north and south. The storefront windows are separated from each other by vertical piers with horizontal bands of smooth-faced and vermiculated limestone. There are revolving doors at the southwestern and southeastern corners of the building. The entrances on Fifth Avenue and Broadway are flanked by a pair of engaged columns, which are vertically fluted and are overlaid by smooth and vermiculated bands of limestone. The columns support an entablature decorated with alternating roundels and triglyphs; immediately above the entablature, on the second story, are oculus windows with console brackets on either side. The entablatures above both entrances are connected by a projecting cornice that wraps around the ground floor. On the second and third stories, each opening generally contains two sash windows. A frieze with dentils runs above the third story.

The prow of the building, facing 23rd Street, includes a pair of two-story-high Classical columns. These were echoed at the top of the building by two columns that supported the cornice. The single-story &quot;cowcatcher&quot; retail space in front of the prow, added to the plans in 1902, was not part of Burnham or Dinkelberg&#x27;s design. The &quot;cowcatcher&quot; structure measured long and tall, with a metal roof. Burnham initially did not want to add the &quot;cowcatcher&quot; space, since he believed it would ruin the symmetry of the prow&#x27;s design, but he was forced to accept the addition on Black&#x27;s insistence.

==== Upper stories ====
The 4th story is designed as a transitional story, with eight sash windows on 22nd Street, as well as 18 sash windows each on Broadway and Fifth Avenue. The windows are flanked by alternating wide and narrow piers, each of which contains terracotta panels with decorations such as foliate motifs, masks, lozenges, and wreaths. Above the 4th story is a frieze with roundels, as well as a cornice.

The 12-story midsection spans the 5th through 16th stories. The 5th and 6th stories each contain sash windows similar to those on the 4th story, but the terracotta piers between each bay are decorated in a simpler design. A frieze with a meander pattern wraps around the building above the 6th story. The Broadway and Fifth Avenue facades both contain three projecting trapezoidal oriels on the 7th through 14th stories; each oriel contains three windows per story. At the time of the Flatiron Building&#x27;s construction, relatively few skyscrapers in New York City used oriels, but they were commonly used in Chicago to break up winds. The 15th story contains sash windows separated by rusticated brick piers. The 16th story contains arched windows; the voussoirs above these windows support a cornice that runs above that story. The 17th story is also designed as a transitional story, with alternating wide and narrow piers decorated with roundels and lions&#x27; heads. Another projecting cornice runs above the 17th story.

The capital consists of the top four stories. The 18th and 19th stories contain an arcade of double-height, double-width arches. Each archway contains a metal frame with multiple glass panes. There are metal spandrel panels between the windows on the 18th and 19th stories. The arches themselves are separated vertically by ornate terracotta piers, topped by capitals with masks and wreaths. The 20th story contains small square windows, above which is a deep cornice with dentils and brackets; the cornice projects about beyond the building&#x27;s perimeter. There are decorative triglyphs between the 20th-story windows.

The 20th story was originally topped by an attic for mechanical equipment; the 21st-story penthouse was added in a subsequent renovation. The attic still exists and is placed between the 20th and 21st stories. Initially, the penthouse was not surrounded by a railing; a balustrade was subsequently added above the 20th story. At the building&#x27;s apex were originally two terracotta sculptures of cherubs. The cherubs symbolized the building&#x27;s &quot;guardian spirits&quot; and held scrolls that surrounded a tablet with George A. Fuller&#x27;s name. The statues were removed to an unknown location in the late 1980s, and a set of replacement cherubs were installed in 2001 after preservationists filed a complaint with the LPC.

===Structural features===
Purdy and Henderson were the structural engineers, and Hamilton J. Chapman was the chief consulting engineer for the project. The construction of the Flatiron was made feasible by a change to New York City&#x27;s building codes in 1892, which eliminated the requirement that masonry be used for fireproofing considerations. This opened the way for steel-skeleton construction. The steel-frame technique was familiar to the Fuller Company, a contracting firm with considerable expertise in building such tall structures. The Flatiron Building&#x27;s construction was relatively easy because it used a steel frame; its 22-story height would have been difficult using other construction methods of that time. The steel bracing, designed by engineer Corydon Purdy of Purdy and Henderson, allowed the Flatiron Building to withstand four times the amount of wind force it could ever be expected to endure. In theory, the frame would remain standing even if the rest of the building were to tip over.

The building&#x27;s frame contains of steel. According to architectural writers Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl W. Condit, as well as the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; and author Joseph J. Korom, each of the stories above ground level measures on Broadway, on Fifth Avenue, and on 22nd Street. &quot;Engineering Record&quot; magazine gives a slightly different measurement of on Fifth Avenue and on 22nd Street. At the vertex, the triangular tower is only or 6.5 feet (2 m) wide. The Broadway and Fifth Avenue elevations meet at an angle of about 25 degrees.

==== Foundation ====
The foundation of the building extends deep and was excavated to the underlying layer of bedrock. It is surrounded by trapezoidal, waterproof retaining walls, which measure between thick. The underlying bedrock ranges from below ground, very close to the bottom of the building&#x27;s foundation. The foundation itself consists of concrete footings with granite caps, above which rise the building&#x27;s steel columns. The cast-iron bases measure square and are placed on slightly wider granite capstones, which measure thick. The concrete footings, placed directly on the bedrock, also have a square cross-section, measuring on each side.

The basement extends beyond the building&#x27;s lot line, occupying vaults underneath the sidewalk and roadways. The vaults have a total area of . Measured from the centers of the columns at the site&#x27;s perimeter, the vaults extend about to the west, to the east, and to the north. These spaces are surrounded by the retaining walls. The ceiling of the vaults is supported by 18 steel columns outside the building&#x27;s lot line. The steel columns are recessed behind the retaining wall and are connected to the retaining wall by horizontal girders, which support the sidewalks above.

==== Superstructure ====

The superstructure is primarily supported by 36 built-up steel columns. Each column is an I-beam measuring across and thick; they have a maximum working stress of . Twenty-five of these columns are placed on the building&#x27;s perimeter: five on 22nd Street and ten each on Fifth Avenue and Broadway. The perimeter columns are spaced apart on Fifth Avenue, apart on Broadway, and apart on 22nd Street. Five of the interior columns are recessed from the Fifth Avenue facade, and there are several interior columns at the south end of the building. At each story, the columns are connected horizontally by a grid of steel girders and floor beams, which mostly run parallel to the Manhattan street grid. The spaces between the horizontal girders are spanned by flat arches made of terracotta. All of the floor beams could carry a live load of . Each column is connected to the horizontal beams by triangular gusset plates, placed both above and below the beams.

From the 1st to the 12th stories, the outer walls are carried on plate girders; the remaining stories contain wall girders, with channels engraved into their surfaces. There is also a masonry pier adjacent to each of the columns on the building&#x27;s perimeter. The framework at the first story is similar to that at the basement, except at the corners and above each entrance. At ground level, the building&#x27;s northern prow is cantilevered from a pair of elliptical girders, while the southwest and southeast corners contain diagonal floor beams. On the upper stories, the corners contain curved wall girders and diagonal floor beams of varying dimensions. In addition, the oriel windows and some of the facade&#x27;s decorative details are cantilevered from the outer walls. On the 18th through 20th stories, the columns are recessed from the outer wall.

Purdy and Henderson designed two systems of wind bracing for the building. One system consists of diagonal steel bars shaped like a rotated &quot;K&quot;, which extend downward from the centers of the horizontal girders. The other system of bracing is similar, but the diagonal steel bars extend both upward and downward from the horizontal girders. A supplemental system of transverse bracing is also used between the foundation and the second floor. The flat roof was built similarly to the floor slabs and could carry a live load of .

===Interior===
The building had of usable space. Contemporary critics considered the structure &quot;quirky&quot;, with drafty wood-framed and copper-clad windows, no central air conditioning, a heating system with cast-iron radiators, an antiquated sprinkler system, and a single staircase for evacuation. The offices were furnished with mahogany and oak, which the Fuller Company advertised as &quot;fireproof&quot;. The triangular shape of the structure led to a &quot;rabbit warren&quot; of oddly-shaped rooms. The offices on each floor were connected by a central passageway, and each floor contained about 20 office cubicles, all of which were connected by various doors. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, offices in the prow had &quot;impressive&quot; views &quot;because of the converging traffic street markings, which accent the telescoping boulevards, and because of the changing seasons in Madison Square Park&quot;.

The building had a power plant that generated high-pressure steam and electricity. In the 1940s, it was one of a few remaining structures in New York City with its own power plant. Bathrooms for males and females are placed on alternating floors, with the men&#x27;s rooms on even floors and the women&#x27;s rooms on odd ones. The women&#x27;s restrooms were not part of the original design.

Until the end of the 20th century, the building also retained its original hydraulic elevators, which were powered by water. Otis Elevator manufactured six hydraulic elevators for the building, although Hecla Iron Works constructed the original elevator cabs. The elevators had a reputation for being slow and, when the elevators&#x27; hydraulic pipes burst, water would often leak into the elevator cabs. To reach the top floor – the 21st, which was added in 1905, three years after the building was completed – a second elevator has to be taken from the 20th floor. On the 21st floor, the bottoms of the windows are chest-high. The hydraulic elevators were replaced with electric cabs in the 1980s, and the original staircase was removed in the 2020s and replaced with two staircases.

=== Status as an icon ===
The Flatiron Building became an icon of New York City upon completion, and public response to it was enthusiastic. The structure attracted not only &quot;sidewalk superintendents&quot; – members of the general public who expressed great interest in the project – but also architects and engineers. Crowds of several hundred people looked at the building &quot;for five and ten minutes at a time&quot;, often from multiple vantage points, while the &quot;Tribune&quot; said that crowds would sometimes look at the building &quot;with their heads bent back until a general breakage of necks seems imminent&quot;. By the mid-20th century, the building no longer attracted crowds, and most tourists &quot;want[ed] to go up in the Flatiron only to take pictures of other taller buildings&quot;. However, it remained well known, even after taller buildings such as the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building were constructed. According to graphic designer Miriam Berman, the building&#x27;s enduring popularity was attributed to the fact that it was &quot;the only famous Manhattan skyscraper that enables tourists to take a picture of the entire building from the ground up&quot;.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the Flatiron Building was &quot;considered &#x27;the most photographed structure&#x27; in New York&quot; in its early years. In part because of its unusual shape and prominent location next to Madison Square Park, it was depicted in books and postcards worldwide. As an icon of New York City, the Flatiron Building was also depicted on other pieces of merchandise, such as plates, mugs, and various tchotchkes. The building&#x27;s exterior remains a popular spot for tourist photographs, making it &quot;possibly one of the most photographed buildings in the world.&quot; The Flatiron&#x27;s status as an icon also led to a trademark dispute in 1999, when Newmark &amp; Company and venture capital firm Flatiron Partners (which was headquartered in a different building) both tried to register an image of the building as a trademark. Flatiron Partners, which had wanted to use the building&#x27;s image as its logo, ultimately licensed the image from Newmark &amp; Company. The American Institute of Architects&#x27; 2007 survey &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; ranked the Flatiron Building among the top 150 buildings in the United States.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Flatiron Building as a city landmark in 1966. The structure, along with the Manhattan Municipal Building, were the first two skyscrapers in New York City to be protected as city landmarks. The Flatiron Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1979. The structure was re-added to the NRHP in 1989 when it was designated a National Historic Landmark. The LPC further designated the Flatiron Building as part of the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District, a city landmark district created in 1989.

==== Critical reception ====
When the building was completed, critical response was not completely positive, and what praise it garnered was often for the cleverness of its engineering. Montgomery Schuyler, editor of &quot;Architectural Record&quot;, said that its &quot;awkwardness [is] entirely undisguised, and without even an attempt to disguise them, if they have not even been aggravated by the treatment. ... The treatment of the tip is an additional and it seems wanton aggravation of the inherent awkwardness of the situation.&quot; He praised the building&#x27;s surface, and the detailing of its terra-cotta work, but questioned the practicality of its large number of windows: &quot;[The tenant] can, perhaps, find wall space within for one roll top desk without overlapping the windows, with light close in front of him and close behind him and close on one side of him. But suppose he needed a bookcase? Undoubtedly he has a highly eligible place from which to view processions. But for the transaction of business?&quot;

Before the Flatiron Building was completed, &quot;Life&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Madison Square is not a bad-looking place as it is, and ought to be one of the beauty spots of the city. It is grievous to think that its fair proportions are to be marred by this outlandish structure.&quot; Sculptor William Ordway Partridge remarked in 1904 that it was &quot;a disgrace to our city, an outrage to our sense of the artistic, and a menace to life&quot;. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; called the new building &quot;A stingy piece of pie ... the greatest inanimate troublemaker in New York&quot;, a sentiment repeated by &quot;Architectural Record&quot;. The Municipal Art Society said that it was &quot;unfit to be in the Center of the City&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;monstrosity&quot;. Even later, Christopher Gray of the &quot;Times&quot; wrote in 1991: &quot;The facade itself is handsome but not exceptional for its time.&quot;
Some critics saw the building differently. Futurist H. G. Wells wrote in his 1906 book &quot;The Future in America: A Search After Realities&quot;: &quot;I found myself agape, admiring a sky-scraper the prow of the Flat-iron Building, to be particular, ploughing up through the traffic of Broadway and Fifth Avenue in the afternoon light.&quot; Architect Robert A. M. Stern wrote in 1983 that the Flatiron was among the city&#x27;s first buildings to &quot;convincingly express the romantic characteristics of the skyscraper&quot;. Karl Zimmermann of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote in 1987 that the Flatiron was &quot;an idiosyncratic wedge blanketed with French Renaissance ornamentation, still remarkable today in its lightness, grace and novelty.&quot;

In May 2023, &quot;Buildworld&quot; conducted a survey of the most loved buildings in the world and in United States. In the U.S. survey, the Flatiron Building ranked fourth, after Fallingwater, the Empire State Building, and the Coit Tower.

==== Photographs ====

The Flatiron was to attract the attention of numerous artists and photographers. It was the subject of one of Edward Steichen&#x27;s atmospheric photographs, taken on a wet wintry late afternoon in 1904, as well as a memorable image by Alfred Stieglitz taken the year before, to which Steichen was paying homage. Stieglitz reflected on the dynamic symbolism of the building, noting upon seeing it one day during a snowstorm that &quot;... it appeared to be moving toward me like the bow of a monster ocean steamer – a picture of a new America still in the making.&quot; He remarked that the Flatiron had a comparable effect on New York as the Parthenon had on Athens. When Stieglitz&#x27;s photograph was published in &quot;Camera Work&quot;, his friend Sadakichi Hartmann, a writer, painter and photographer, accompanied it with an essay on the building: &quot;A curious creation, no doubt, but can it be called beautiful? Beauty is a very abstract idea ... Why should the time not arrive when the majority without hesitation will pronounce the &#x27;Flat-iron&#x27; a thing of beauty?&quot;

Besides Stieglitz and Steichen, photographers such as Alvin Langdon Coburn and Jessie Tarbox Beals took photographs of the building. Painters of the Ashcan School, like John Sloan, Everett Shinn, and Ernest Lawson also painted images of the building, as did Paul Cornoyer and Childe Hassam. Lithographer Joseph Pennell, illustrator John Edward Jackson, and French Cubist Albert Gleizes all took the Flatiron as the subject of their work. The edifice was also depicted in Samuel Halpert&#x27;s 1919 painting &quot;Flatiron Building&quot;, later placed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s collection.

==== Wind gusts and &quot;23 skidoo&quot; ====


The building&#x27;s most common criticism focused on its structure, on the grounds that the &quot;combination of triangular shape and height would cause the building to fall down&quot;. When construction began, locals placed bets on how far the debris would spread when the wind knocked the building down. This presumed susceptibility to damage had also given it the nickname &quot;Burnham&#x27;s Folly&quot;. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; was one of a few contemporary sources to describe the building&#x27;s shape favorably, saying: &quot;A triangle is the safest possible form of building, as the triangle is the strongest of the geometric form.&quot;

Due to the geography of the site, with Broadway on one side, Fifth Avenue on the other, and the open expanse of Madison Square and the park in front of it, the wind currents around the building could be treacherous. Wind from the north would split around the building, downdrafts from above and updrafts from the vaulted area under the street would combine to make the wind unpredictable. The winds raised women&#x27;s skirts and scattered paper bills from pedestrians&#x27; pocketbooks. According to some accounts, this gave rise to the phrase &quot;23 skidoo&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;23 skiddoo&quot;). Policemen would shout this phrase at men who tried to get glimpses of women&#x27;s dresses being blown up by the winds swirling around the building due to the strong downdrafts. Films from the Library of Congress confirm that the building&#x27;s shape did contribute to high winds around the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and 23rd Street. However, the origin of the phrase &quot;23 skidoo&quot; itself is disputed; even before the building was constructed, the number &quot;twenty-three&quot; and the word &quot;skidoo&quot; were independently used as expressions of dismissal.

The winds allegedly also caused damage to neighboring structures, prompting some critics to request that the Flatiron Building be shortened or demolished. The winds prompted a lawsuit from a nearby property owner, and they were also blamed for the 1903 death of a bicycle messenger, who was blown into the street and run over by a car. Newspapers of the time also claimed that &quot;every window in the building&quot; would break in high winds, although the &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot; observed that only a few windows broke during one such instance of high winds. Pedestrians were initially reluctant to walk on the same side of the street as the Flatiron Building because of concerns over the wind gusts, but these concerns had largely dissipated by the mid-20th century.

=== Design influence ===

Unlike other structures, such as the Seagram Building or New York City&#x27;s brownstone houses, the Flatiron Building&#x27;s shape was rarely copied by other structures in the city until the early 21st century. This was in part because many buildings occupied rectangular sites on Manhattan&#x27;s street grid; furthermore, developers tended to avoid buying oddly-shaped plots, as their unconventional dimensions were hard to market to potential tenants. Consequently, in the early 20th century, the Flatiron Building was one of only two major buildings that were developed at the intersection of Broadway and another north–south avenue; the other was the Times Tower. Although some buildings in lower Manhattan, such as One Wall Street Court, also contain a flatiron shape, they generally were not as well known as the Flatiron Building. A shortage of available land lots prompted the development of other triangular structures in the city during the 2010s, such as 10 Sullivan and 100 Franklin.

=== In popular culture ===
One of the first films to depict the Flatiron Building was created by Robert Bonine, who used a kinetograph to film the building on October 8, 1902, a week after the building opened. In the 1958 comedy film &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, James Stewart and Kim Novak were filmed on top of the Flatiron Building in a romantic clinch. For Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Reds&quot;, the base of the building was used for a scene with Diane Keaton.

Today, the Flatiron Building is frequently used in television commercials and documentaries as an easily recognizable symbol of the city, shown, for instance, in the opening credits of the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; or in scenes of New York City that are shown during scene transitions in the TV sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, and &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;. In 1987, the building was used as the scene of a murder for the TV series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, in the episode &quot;No Accounting for Murder&quot;. In the 1998 film &quot;Godzilla&quot;, it is accidentally destroyed by the US Army while in pursuit of Godzilla. It is depicted as the headquarters of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, for which Peter Parker is a freelance photographer, in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, and once again in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; animated series. It is shown in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; TV series as well. In the 2006–2012 comic book series &quot;The Boys&quot; as well as the 2022 third season and 2024 fourth season of its television adaptation, it is depicted as the headquarters of the titular CIA black ops group.

In 2013, the Whitney Museum of American Art installed a life-sized 3D-cutout replica of Edward Hopper&#x27;s 1942 painting &quot;Nighthawks&quot; in the Flatiron Art Space in the building&#x27;s prow. Although Hopper said his picture was inspired by a diner in Greenwich Village, the prow is reminiscent of the painting, and was selected to display the two-dimensional cutouts. In 2014, the Lego Architecture series produced a model of the Flatiron Building to add to their landmark series. The subsequent New York City set, introduced in 2015, also included the building.

The Flatiron Building was also the subject of a book, &quot;The Flatiron: The New York Landmark and the Incomparable City that Arose With It&quot;, published in 2010 and written by Alice Sparberg Alexiou.

&quot;Lego&quot; released a set based on iconic New York City landmarks, including the Flatiron Building.

<text>The Ark-La-Tex (a portmanteau of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas; also stylized as Arklatex or ArkLaTex) is a socio-economic tri-state region where the Southern U.S. states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas join together. The region contains portions of Northwest Louisiana, Northeast Texas, and South Arkansas as well as the extreme southeastern tip of Oklahoma, in McCurtain County (part of Choctaw Country), partly centered upon the Red River, which flows along the Texas–Oklahoma state line into Southwestern Arkansas and Northwest Louisiana.

The population of the 40-county core region as of 2020 is 1,469,860 people, down from 1,515,056 in 2010. Shreveport, Louisiana, with 187,593 people in 2020, is the largest city, economic and geographic center of the region, and principal hub for both the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan area and Northwestern Louisiana. Longview, Texas, with a population of 81,683 people in 2020, is the second-largest city as well as a principal city of the Tyler–Longview metropolitan conurbation and Greater Longview metropolitan area. The twin cities of Texarkana, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas, are the fourth- and sixth-largest cities, respectively, but collectively make up the region&#x27;s third-largest metropolitan area (with a combined population exceeding 140,000 residents) as the center of the Texarkana metropolitan area encompassing Miller County, Arkansas, and Bowie County, Texas. Other cities in the Ark-La-Tex with 20,000 or more residents include Bossier City, Louisiana; Nacogdoches, Texas; Marshall, Texas; and Ruston, Louisiana.

The counties in the area&#x27;s western section are largely part of the East Texas region (except for McCurtain County, Oklahoma, which is part of the Choctaw Country tourist region) and mainly encompass the Tyler–Longview–Lufkin–Nacogdoches television market area, while the counties and parishes in the eastern half of the region are included in the Shreveport–Texarkana television market. However, some Arkansas counties—under certain, looser definitions of the Ark-La-Tex region—in northwesternmost areas of the southwestern section of the state are included in the Little Rock viewing area.

==Etymology==
Although use of the term to refer to the tri-state region dates back to the early 1900s, the name &quot;Ark-La-Tex&quot; was popularized regionally by a Shreveport Chamber of Commerce promotional campaign developed in 1932–33 to increase tourism in the area.

The campaign, dubbing the area as &quot;The Land of Arklatex&quot;, was based on the idea that &quot;the interests of all the people in the Tri-state area of South Arkansas, North Louisiana and East Texas are practically identical in matters pertaining to agriculture, industry, commerce and trade, and education.&quot; The region is alternatively, although seldom in most media and promotional parlance, referred to as &quot;Arklatexoma&quot;, which more inclusively encompasses McCurtain County and other parts of extreme Southeastern Oklahoma that lie along the Red River.

==Geography==
The Ark-La-Tex covers over across the four-state area; if the Ark-La-Tex were a U.S. state, it would be larger than Maryland. Most of the Ark-La-Tex is located in the Piney Woods, an ecoregion of dense forests of mixed deciduous and conifer flora. The forests are periodically punctuated by sloughs and bayous that are linked to larger bodies of water such as Caddo Lake or the Red River. Three of the four National Forests located within the Piney Woods of East Texas are wholly or partially within the Ark-La-Tex boundaries: Angelina National Forest (spanning Angelina, Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Jasper counties), Sabine National Forest (near Hemphill) and Davy Crockett National Forest (between Lufkin and Crockett).

The Red River is the principal mainstem waterway in the region, exiting from the eastern end of Lake Texoma and running generally east along the Oklahoma–Texas border towards Southwestern Arkansas (entering it near the state line between Little River County, Arkansas, and Bowie County, Texas) before turning southward northwest of Texarkana (in so doing, forming the eastern border of Miller County) and passing into Northwestern Louisiana. The bordering Louisiana cities of Shreveport and Bossier City were developed along the river bank; its span within the Ark-La-Tex ends in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana (where the Red River spans to the adjacent northwest of the parish&#x27;s namesake county seat), at its intersection with Grant and Rapides parishes.

===Definition===
As with all vernacular regions, the Ark-La-Tex has no official boundaries or status and is defined differently by various sources. Most definitions of the Ark-La-Tex delineate the region as encompassing 40 parishes and counties, and most weather radars suggest a 40-county or -parish area.
====Louisiana (13 parishes)====
* Bienville
* Bossier
* Caddo
* Claiborne
* DeSoto
* Jackson
* Lincoln
* Natchitoches
* Red River
* Sabine
* Union
* Webster
* Winn

====Arkansas (10 counties)====
* Columbia
* Hempstead
* Howard
* Lafayette
* Little River
* Miller
* Nevada
* Ouachita
* Sevier
* Union
====Oklahoma (one county)====
* McCurtain

====Texas (16 counties)====
* Bowie

* Cass
* Gregg
* Harrison
* Marion
* Morris
* Nacogdoches
* Panola
* Red River
* Rusk
* Sabine
* San Augustine
* Shelby
* Titus
* Upshur
Alternate definitions can include eight additional Texas counties (Lamar, Delta, Hopkins, Franklin, Wood, Smith, Cherokee, and Angelina), include the Monroe, Louisiana metropolitan area and Ouachita Parish, Louisiana (which is considered part of the Ark-La-Miss region), exclude the counties encompassing the El Dorado, Arkansas micropolitan area, or exclude McCurtain County, Oklahoma. McCurtain County is usually included in the region&#x27;s areal definition, primarily for media distribution purposes, even though the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation formally defines it as being part of its Choctaw Country tourism region. Another alternate definition is solely the vicinity of the Ark-La-Tex region&#x27;s three principal cities, Shreveport, Longview, and Texarkana.

===Climate===
The Ark-La-Tex is situated in a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) typical of the Southeastern United States, albeit occasionally interrupted by intrusions of cold air during the winter months. Rainfall is abundant, with the normal annual precipitation averaging over in some areas (such as Shreveport), with monthly averages ranging from less than in August to more than in June. Portions of East Texas within the region receive more rainfall, , than the rest of the state. Due to the flat topography of some areas and the prominence of smaller waterways that are prone to backwater flooding from the Red River, communities occasionally experience severe flooding events. A notable occurrence of severe flooding occurred in March 2016, after torrential rains caused a rapid rise of many local waterways, displacing upwards of 3,500 people from their homes across Caddo and Bossier parishes and adjacent areas of Northwest Louisiana that lie along the Red River. Freezing rain and ice storms occasionally occur during the winter months.

Severe thunderstorms with heavy rain, hail, damaging winds and tornadoes occur in the area during the spring and summer months, although severe weather can also occur during the winter months. The region is in the western section of the &quot;Dixie Alley&quot; tornado climatology region, where tornadogenesis is most often attributed by high precipitation supercell thunderstorms—within which tornadoes are often partially or fully wrapped in curtains of heavy rain, impairing them from being seen by storm spotters and chasers, law enforcement, and the public—due to an increase of moisture from proximity to the nearby Gulf of Mexico. Some areas of the region, such as Bossier City, average a slightly above normal rate of tornadoes when compared to the national average. The winter months are normally mild; Shreveport, in particular, averages 35 days of freezing or below-freezing temperatures per year. Ice and sleet storms occasionally occur during this timeframe. The summer months are hot and humid, with high to very high relative average humidity, often as a result of moisture being advected from the Gulf of Mexico; in Shreveport, maximum temperatures exceed an average of 91 days per year.

The National Weather Service (NWS) operates a Weather Forecast Office in Shreveport, which provides local weather forecasts and warnings, watches and advisories for hazardous weather conditions for 39 counties and parishes within the greater Ark-La-Tex region.

==Culture==
The culture of the Ark-La-Tex region, and especially its music, shows a mixture of influences from the related, but distinct, cultures of its surrounding states. The music of the area is marked by country and blues sounds typical of the music of the Southern United States, the Western music of Texas, and the well-documented music of New Orleans and Acadiana in Louisiana. The area had a significant role in the development of country and rock-and-roll music, beginning in the 1940s. On March 1, 1948, Shreveport radio station KWKH launched a country music variety show called the &quot;Ark-La-Tex Jubilee&quot;, followed a month later by the long-running and influential &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; program. &quot;Hayride&quot; director Horace Logan and regular performer Webb Pierce started a music publishing company called Ark-La-Tex Music. Drummer Brian Blade, a Shreveport native, included a song entitled &quot;Ark.La.Tex.&quot; on his 2014 album &quot;Landmarks&quot;, exploring the mixture of musical influences in his home region.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===

The region contains Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, part of the University of Texas System, and Louisiana Tech University, a public research university in Ruston, which are the largest public institutions of higher education in the Ark-La-Tex. Named after Stephen F. Austin, who led the second and most successful colonization of the region that would become the state of Texas through the migration of 300 families from other parts of the United States in 1825, the former of the two major universities was founded as a teachers&#x27; college in 1923 as a result of legislation authored by State Senator Wilfred Roy Cousins, Sr. Louisiana Tech opened in 1894 (as the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana) to provide educational subjects pertaining to the arts and sciences for the development of an industrial economy in Louisiana post-Reconstruction. In the 1960s the school (then named Louisiana Polytechnic Institute) became desegregated, and allowed integrated classes with white and black students; after it achieved criteria of a research university under the leadership of President F. Jay Taylor, the university officially adopted its current name in 1970. Louisiana Tech also operates a satellite campus in Shreveport as well as classes at the Academic Success Center and Barksdale Air Force Base Instructional Site in Bossier City, and at the CenturyLink corporate headquarters in Monroe. Ruston is also home to a branch campus of Monroe-based Louisiana Delta Community College.

The Shreveport–Bossier City area is home to several colleges; among them, the Methodist-affiliated Centenary College of Louisiana (originally founded in the East Feliciana Parish town of Jackson in 1825, eventually relocating to Shreveport in 1908), Louisiana Baptist University and Theological Seminary (founded in 1973), Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport (opened in 1969 as the only medical school in northern Louisiana) and one of the largest nursing schools in northern Louisiana, the Northwestern State University College of Nursing (opened in 1949) as well as satellite campuses of Louisiana State University (opened as a two-year institution in 1967, and expanded into a four-year college in 1976), Southern University (opened in 1967 with a two-year associate&#x27;s degree program). Longview, Texas, is home to LeTourneau University, a private, four-year Christian university founded by R.G. LeTourneau in 1946, originally as LeTourneau Technical Institute. Inclusively, Tyler, Texas is also home to satellite higher education campuses through the University of Texas System by way of the University of Texas at Tyler (opened in 1971 as Tyler State College) and the University of Texas Health Center at Tyler (opened in 1947 as the East Texas Tuberculosis Sanitarium and chartered into The University of Texas System in 1977 by the system&#x27;s Board of Regents) as well as one of two independent institutions, Tyler Junior College (opened in 1926).

The Texarkana metropolitan area is home to Texas A&amp;M University–Texarkana, a four-year satellite branch of the Texas A&amp;M University System (founded as an upper-level extension college of East Texas State University in 1971), and Texarkana College (a public community college formed in 1927 as a branch of the Texarkana Independent School District and separated into an independent institution via a public vote in 1941). Arkadelphia is home to two liberal arts institutions: Henderson State University (founded in 1890 as Arkadelphia Methodist College), which is the only member of the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges based in Arkansas and announced plans to join the Arkansas State University System in October 2019, and Ouachita Baptist University, a private, Baptist college affiliated with the Arkansas Baptist State Convention (opened in 1886).

The area also houses several historically black colleges and universities (HBCU). The largest of these, Grambling State University, located in the namesake Lincoln Parish town of Grambling ( west of the Louisiana Tech University campus), was founded in 1901 as the Colored Industrial and Agricultural School. The university was created out of the desire of African-American farmers in rural areas of northern Louisiana to educate other black residents in that section of the state; it moved to its present location in 1905 (as the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School) and became a state junior college (renamed the Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute) by 1928, when it began offering two-year professional certificates and diplomas to graduates. Grambling received accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1949. Other HBCUs in the region include Texas College in Tyler (opened in 1894), Jarvis Christian College in Hawkins (a Christian-based HBCU founded in 1912), and Wiley College in Marshall (a private liberal arts college founded in 1873 by Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Isaac Wiley and certified in 1882 by the Freedman&#x27;s Aid Society, which is one of the oldest predominantly black colleges west of the Mississippi River).

==Transportation==
===Airports===
Shreveport Regional Airport (IATA: SHV; ICAO: KSHV), located off Hollywood Avenue in southwestern Shreveport, is the region&#x27;s primary commercial airport. Established in 1952, Shreveport Regional is served by Allegiant Air (with flights to McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas and Orlando Sanford International Airport), American Airlines (to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport), Delta Air Lines (to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport), GLO Airlines (to Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport), and United Airlines (as United Express, to George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and Denver International Airport). Shreveport Downtown Airport (IATA: DTN; ICAO: KDTN), built in 1931 and located north of downtown Shreveport along the Red River, is the city&#x27;s general aviation airport and also serves as a reliever airport for Shreveport Regional Airport, itself built to replace the Downtown Airport as Shreveport&#x27;s main commercial airport due to the limited growth that could be made to that facility due to its close proximity of the Red River.

General and limited commercial aviation is additionally available at several smaller airfields in the Ark-La-Tex; Tyler Pounds Regional Airport (IATA: TYR; ICAO: KTYR), a city-owned public use airport in Tyler; offers service to and from Dallas/Fort Worth International and, on a seasonal basis, Denver International, respectively, via American Eagle and Frontier Airlines. East Texas Regional Airport (IATA: GGG; ICAO: KGGG), located south of Longview, is used for general aviation and military training but also provides connector service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport via American Airlines and American Eagle. Texarkana Regional Airport (IATA: TXK; ICAO: KTXK), a city-owned public use facility located northeast of Texarkana, Arkansas&#x27;s central business district, mainly provides general aviation travel but is also served by American Eagle. Exclusively general aviation service is provided by Angelina County Airport (IATA: LFK; ICAO: KLFK), located southwest of downtown Lufkin; A.L. Mangham Jr. Regional Airport (IATA: OCH; ICAO: KOCH), located outside Loop 224 northwest of TX State Highway 7; and Natchitoches Regional Airport (ICAO: KIER), located south of downtown Natchitoches.

===Major highways===
The Ark-La-Tex is an integral point on the United States Interstate Network, with three major interstate highways—Interstate 20, Interstate 30, and Interstate 49—servicing the region, connecting five of the region&#x27;s largest cities, Tyler, Longview, Marshall, Shreveport and Bossier City. Interstates 20 and 49—the latter of which has its northern terminus at the intersection of the former of the two Interstates—bisect Shreveport, intersecting with I-220 and LA Highway 3132 (which both serve as bypass routes connecting the northern and southern parts of Shreveport) on the city&#x27;s west side, with U.S. 171 in downtown Shreveport, and with I-220 in central Bossier Parish (north of Barksdale Air Force Base, at which point it begins sharing an overlap with U.S. 71 as it traverses eastward towards Monroe).

The region is a point within the planned extension of the otherwise presently disjointed Interstate 69. A branch of the Interstate (I-369) presently runs north on U.S. 59 within Texas from Tenaha to Texarkana, where the span will eventually connect to Interstates 30 and 49. In response to widespread opposition from environmental groups and property rights activists, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) announced in June 2008 that it would complete I-69 through upgrades to the existing spans of U.S. 59, U.S. 77 and U.S. 281 to Interstate standards through rural areas, with bypasses around urban centers along the route, which will be financed through private sector investment. An approximately portion of the I-69 extension to extend from south of Clarksdale, Mississippi, to the Louisiana/Texas state line will be built as a new-terrain route that parallels existing U.S. and state highways in some areas. One of the current segments, SIU 16, covers areas of East Texas to the northeast of Nacogdoches, extending until it terminates at U.S. 171 near Stonewall. Another segment, SIU 15, continues over the southern and eastern sections of Shreveport, crossing I-49 and ending at I-20 near Haughton. The third existing segment, SIU 14, extends northeast from I-20 to US 82 near El Dorado, Arkansas.

===River transportation===
River transportation is available through two inland multi-modal transportation and distribution centers along the Red River: the Port of Caddo-Bossier, located at the head of navigation on the J. Bennett Johnston Waterway ( south of Shreveport on LA Highway 1), and the Natchitoches Parish Port, located on Louisiana Highways 6 and 486 (U.S. 71/U.S. 84) in Campti, Louisiana on the only slack water port on the Red River. The Port of Caddo-Bossier began loading its first cargo in 1995, and has () received more than nine million tons of barge freight and over eight million tons of rail freight. The port—which houses more than 17 freight and shipping companies—links the Ark-La-Tex to domestic and international markets via the Mississippi River, and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Bossier City hosts three riverboat casino gambling resorts along the east bank of the Red River: Margaritaville Resort Casino, Horseshoe Bossier City, and Boomtown Bossier City.

<doc id="253859" wikidata="Q5870985" url="?curid=253859" title="History of topos theory">
<text>This article gives some very general background to the mathematical idea of topos. This is an aspect of category theory, and has a reputation for being abstruse. The level of abstraction involved cannot be reduced beyond a certain point; but on the other hand context can be given. This is partly in terms of historical development, but also to some extent an explanation of differing attitudes to category theory. 

==In the school of Grothendieck==
During the latter part of the 1950s, the foundations of algebraic geometry were being rewritten; and it is here that the origins of the topos concept are to be found. At that time the Weil conjectures were an outstanding motivation to research. As we now know, the route towards their proof, and other advances, lay in the construction of étale cohomology.

With the benefit of hindsight, it can be said that algebraic geometry had been wrestling with two problems for a long time. The first was to do with its points: back in the days of projective geometry it was clear that the absence of &#x27;enough&#x27; points on an algebraic variety was a barrier to having a good geometric theory (in which it was somewhat like a compact manifold). There was also the difficulty, that was clear as soon as topology took form in the first half of the twentieth century, that the topology of algebraic varieties had &#x27;too few&#x27; open sets.

The question of points was close to resolution by 1950; Alexander Grothendieck took a sweeping step (invoking the Yoneda lemma) that disposed of it—naturally at a cost, that every variety or more general &quot;scheme&quot; should become a functor. It wasn&#x27;t possible to &quot;add&quot; open sets, though. The way forward was otherwise.

The topos definition first appeared somewhat obliquely, in or about 1960. General problems of so-called &#x27;descent&#x27; in algebraic geometry were considered, at the same period when the fundamental group was generalised to the algebraic geometry setting (as a pro-finite group). In the light of later work (c. 1970), &#x27;descent&#x27; is part of the theory of comonads; here we can see one way in which the Grothendieck school bifurcates in its approach from the &#x27;pure&#x27; category theorists, a theme that is important for the understanding of how the topos concept was later treated.

There was perhaps a more direct route available: the abelian category concept had been introduced by Grothendieck in his foundational work on homological algebra, to unify categories of sheaves of abelian groups, and of modules. An abelian category is supposed to be closed under certain category-theoretic operations—by using this kind of definition one can focus entirely on structure, saying nothing at all about the nature of the objects involved. This type of definition can be traced back, in one line, to the lattice concept of the 1930s. It was a possible question to ask, around 1957, for a purely category-theoretic characterisation of categories of sheaves of &quot;sets&quot;, the case of sheaves of abelian groups having been subsumed by Grothendieck&#x27;s work (the &quot;Tôhoku&quot; paper).

Such a definition of a topos was eventually given five years later, around 1962, by Grothendieck and Verdier (see Verdier&#x27;s Nicolas Bourbaki seminar &quot;Analysis Situs&quot;). The characterisation was by means of categories &#x27;with enough colimits&#x27;, and applied to what is now called a Grothendieck topos. The theory was rounded out by establishing that a Grothendieck topos was a category of sheaves, where now the word &quot;sheaf&quot; had acquired an extended meaning, since it involved a Grothendieck topology.

The idea of a Grothendieck topology (also known as a &quot;site&quot;) has been characterised by John Tate as a bold pun on the two senses of Riemann surface. Technically speaking it enabled the construction of the sought-after étale cohomology (as well as other refined theories such as flat cohomology and crystalline cohomology). At this point—about 1964—the developments powered by algebraic geometry had largely run their course. The &#x27;open set&#x27; discussion had effectively been summed up in the conclusion that varieties had a rich enough &quot;site&quot; of open sets in unramified covers of their (ordinary) Zariski-open sets.

==From pure category theory to categorical logic==
The current definition of topos goes back to William Lawvere and Myles Tierney. While the timing follows closely on from that described above, as a matter of history, the attitude is different, and the definition is more inclusive. That is, there are examples of toposes that are not a Grothendieck topos. What is more, these may be of interest for a number of logical disciplines.

Lawvere and Tierney&#x27;s definition picks out the central role in topos theory of the sub-object classifier. In the usual category of sets, this is the two-element set of Boolean truth-values, true and false. It is almost tautologous to say that the subsets of a given set &quot;X&quot; are &quot;the same as&quot; (just as good as) the functions on &quot;X&quot; to any such given two-element set: fix the &#x27;first&#x27; element and make a subset &quot;Y&quot; correspond to the function sending &quot;Y&quot; there and its complement in &quot;X&quot; to the other element.

Now sub-object classifiers can be found in sheaf theory. Still tautologously, though certainly more abstractly, for a topological space &quot;X&quot; there is a direct description of a sheaf on &quot;X&quot; that plays the role with respect to all sheaves of sets on &quot;X&quot;. Its set of sections over an open set &quot;U&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is just the set of open subsets of &quot;U&quot;. The space associated with a sheaf, for it, is more difficult to describe.

Lawvere and Tierney therefore formulated axioms for a topos that assumed a sub-object classifier, and some limit conditions (to make a cartesian-closed category, at least). For a while this notion of topos was called &#x27;elementary topos&#x27;.

Once the idea of a connection with logic was formulated, there were several developments &#x27;testing&#x27; the new theory:

* models of set theory corresponding to proofs of the independence of the axiom of choice and continuum hypothesis by Paul Cohen&#x27;s method of forcing.
* recognition of the connection with Kripke semantics, the intuitionistic existential quantifier and intuitionistic type theory.
* combining these, discussion of the intuitionistic theory of real numbers, by sheaf models.

==Position of topos theory==
There was some irony that in the pushing through of David Hilbert&#x27;s long-range programme a natural home for intuitionistic logic&#x27;s central ideas was found: Hilbert had detested the school of L. E. J. Brouwer. Existence as &#x27;local&#x27; existence in the sheaf-theoretic sense, now going by the name of Kripke–Joyal semantics, is a good match. On the other hand Brouwer&#x27;s long efforts on &#x27;species&#x27;, as he called the intuitionistic theory of reals, are presumably in some way subsumed and deprived of status beyond the historical. There is a theory of the real numbers in each topos, and so no one master intuitionist theory.

The later work on étale cohomology has tended to suggest that the full, general topos theory isn&#x27;t required. On the other hand, other sites are used, and the Grothendieck topos has taken its place within homological algebra.

The Lawvere programme was to write higher-order logic in terms of category theory. That this can be done cleanly is shown by the book treatment by Joachim Lambek and P. J. Scott. What results is essentially an intuitionistic (i.e. constructive logic) theory, its content being clarified by the existence of a &quot;free topos&quot;. That is a set theory, in a broad sense, but also something belonging to the realm of pure syntax. The structure on its sub-object classifier is that of a Heyting algebra. To get a more classical set theory one can look at toposes in which it is moreover a Boolean algebra, or specialising even further, at those with just two truth-values. In that book, the talk is about constructive mathematics; but in fact this can be read as foundational computer science (which is not mentioned). If one wants to discuss set-theoretic operations, such as the formation of the image (range) of a function, a topos is guaranteed to be able to express this, entirely constructively.

It also produced a more accessible spin-off in pointless topology, where the &quot;locale&quot; concept isolates some insights found by treating &quot;topos&quot; as a significant development of &quot;topological space&quot;. The slogan is &#x27;points come later&#x27;: this brings discussion full circle on this page. The point of view is written up in Peter Johnstone&#x27;s &quot;Stone Spaces&quot;, which has been called by a leader in the field of computer science &#x27;a treatise on extensionality&#x27;. The extensional is treated in mathematics as ambient—it is not something about which mathematicians really expect to have a theory. Perhaps this is why topos theory has been treated as an oddity; it goes beyond what the traditionally geometric way of thinking allows. The needs of thoroughly intensional theories such as untyped lambda calculus have been met in denotational semantics. Topos theory has long looked like a possible &#x27;master theory&#x27; in this area.

==Summary==
The &quot;topos&quot; concept arose in algebraic geometry, as a consequence of combining the concept of &quot;sheaf&quot; and &quot;closure under categorical operations&quot;. It plays a certain definite role in cohomology theories. A &#x27;killer application&#x27; is étale cohomology.

The subsequent developments associated with logic are more interdisciplinary. They include examples drawing on homotopy theory (classifying toposes). They involve links between category theory and mathematical logic, and also (as a high-level, organisational discussion) between category theory and theoretical computer science based on type theory. Granted the general view of Saunders Mac Lane about &quot;ubiquity&quot; of concepts, this gives them a definite status. The use of toposes as unifying bridges in mathematics has been pioneered by Olivia Caramello in her 2017 book.

<text>Reichenau () is a village in the municipality of Tamins in the Canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, where the two Rhine tributaries &quot;Vorderrhein&quot; and &quot;Hinterrhein&quot; meet, forming the Alpine Rhine. 
It is a major traffic junction of the routes from Chur towards the &quot;Oberalp Pass&quot; and &quot;Lukmanier Pass&quot; and from Chur towards &quot;San Bernardino Pass&quot; and &quot;Julier Pass&quot;. 

The civilisation of the place is traced back until the year 500. The name originates from the Benedictine Abbey of Reichenau on Reichenau Island in Lake Constance which owned properties in this area during the Middle Ages. The monastery was founded in 724 and drew to itself abbots with connections to the highest Carolingian and Ottonian society; it housed a school, and a famous scriptorium. See Abbey of Reichenau.

In the 14th century the first bridges were built over the Rhine tributaries.

A roadhouse was built 1570 to collect the bridge toll. In the 17th century the first buildings for the sovereignty of Reichenau were built which became the castle of Reichenau. The Rhaetian Railway reached Reichenau in 1896.

==Transportation==
Rhaetian Railway operate services to Reichenau-Tamins (Rhaetian Railway station) nearby.

<doc id="253862" wikidata="Q140656" url="?curid=253862" title="Rithmomachia">
<text>Rithmomachia (also known as rithmomachy, arithmomachia, rythmomachy, rhythmomachy, the philosophers&#x27; game, and other variants) is an early European mathematical board game. Its earliest known description dates from the eleventh century. The name comes loosely from Greek and means &quot;The Battle of the Numbers.&quot; The game is somewhat like chess except that most methods of capture depend on the numbers inscribed on each piece.

The game was used as an educational tool that teachers could introduce while teaching arithmetic as part of the &quot;quadrivium&quot; to those in Western Europe who received a classical education during the medieval period. David Sepkoski wrote that between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, &quot;rithmomachia served as a practical exemplar for teaching the contemplative values of Boethian mathematical philosophy, which emphasized the natural harmony and perfection of number and proportion, that it was used both as a mnemonic drill for the study of Boethian number theory and, more importantly, as a vehicle for moral education, by reminding players of the mathematical harmony of creation.&quot; The game declined sharply in popularity in the 17th century, as it was no longer used in education, and potential players were not introduced to it during their schooling.

==History==

Little is known about the origin of the game. Medieval writers attributed it to Pythagoras, but no trace of it has been discovered in Greek literature. The earliest surviving mentions of it are from the early 11th century, suggesting it was created in the late 10th or early 11th century. The name and its many variations are from Greek; it is unclear whether this was due to being created by a rare Western European with a classical education that involved learning Greek, or if the game had a genuine origin in Greece and the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire of the period.

The first written evidence of Rithmomachia dates to around 1030, when a monk named Asilo (probably the future Bishop Adalbero of Würzburg) created a game that illustrated the number theory of Boethius&#x27; &quot;De institutione arithmetica&quot;, for the students of monastery schools. &quot;De institutione arithmetica&quot; was the standard textbook for instruction in arithmetics in the period for those lucky enough to receive a medieval education. The rules of the game were improved and spelled out more shortly thereafter by another monk, Hermannus Contractus (1013–1054) from Reichenau, and in the school of Liège. In the following centuries, Rithmomachia spread through schools and monasteries in the southern parts of Germany and France. It was used mainly as a teaching aid, but gradually intellectuals started to play it for pleasure. In the 13th century Rithmomachia came to England, where famous mathematician Thomas Bradwardine wrote a text about it. Even Roger Bacon recommended Rithmomachia to his students, while Sir Thomas More let the inhabitants described in the book &quot;Utopia&quot; play it for recreation. The game was known well enough to justify printed treatises in Latin, French, Italian, and German, in the sixteenth century. Two notices advertising a game set for sale have been found, one in Paris (1556) and the other in London (1563). Nevertheless, no archaeological evidence of the game (such as playing boards) has survived from the medieval and early modern periods, in contrast to many other board games.

Rithmomachia was at its most popular in the 16th century. The Tudor polymath, statesman and publisher of the Geneva Bible, Sir Rowland Hill, published on the game under the title &quot;The most ancient and learned Playe, called the Philosopher&#x27;s Game invented for the honest recreation of Students and other sober persons, in passing the tedious of tyme to the release of their labours, and the exercise of their Wittes&quot; in 1562; his house at Soulton Hall also contains a board for the game on a basement parlour or prayer room.

In 1572 Francesco Barozzi published a version in Venice which was translated into German by Augustus II, Duke of Brunswick. It lost its popularity sharply in the 17th century, virtually disappearing as the style of teaching mathematics changed, and Boethius&#x27;s mathematics was considered old-fashioned and obsolete. One issue was that the rules were never standardized, with major variations from teacher to teacher. The game partially survived by clinging to the now far more popular chess. Gustavus Selenus included the rules of rithmomachia as an appendix in one of his books on chess, and the game persisted as &quot;arithmetic chess&quot; or &quot;numerical checkers&quot; as a side mention in German chess books for some time afterward, a curiosity but a rarely-played one. The game was rediscovered in the 20th century by historians of board games such as Arno Borst.

==Gameplay==
Rithmomachia is played on a board resembling the one used for chess or checkers with eight squares on the shorter side, but with sixteen on the longer side. The forms used for the pieces were triangles, squares, and rounds. Pyramids could be formed by stacking pieces. The game was noteworthy in that the black and white forces were not symmetrical. Although each side had the same array of pieces, the numbers on them differed, allowing different possible captures and winning configurations to the two players.

The rules below describe the most common version of the game, played through much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. There was also a variant propounded by Fulke in the 16th century, with significantly different (and somewhat more consistent) capture rules.

===Pieces===
There are four types of pieces: Rounds, Triangles, Squares, and Pyramids.
* Rounds: Rounds move one square in any of the four diagonals.
* Triangles: Triangles can move exactly two squares vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
* Squares: Squares can move exactly three squares vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally.
* Pyramids: Pyramids are not actually one piece, but more than one piece put together. The white pyramid is made of a &quot;36&quot; square, a &quot;25&quot; square, a &quot;16&quot; triangle, a &quot;9&quot; triangle, a &quot;4&quot; round, and a &quot;1&quot; round, which totals up to the pyramid&#x27;s value of 91. The black pyramid is made up of a &quot;64&quot; square, a &quot;49&quot; square, a &quot;36&quot; triangle, a &quot;25&quot; triangle, and a &quot;16&quot; round, which adds up to the pyramid&#x27;s value of 190. These irregular values make it hard for them to be captured by most of the capturing methods listed below, except for siege. Pyramids can move like a round, a triangle, or a square, as long as they still contain the respective piece, which makes them very valuable.

===Capturing===
There were a variety of capture methods. Pieces do not land on another piece to capture it, but instead remain in their square and remove the other. If a piece is captured, it changes sides.

* Meeting: If a piece could capture another piece with the same value by landing on it, the piece stays in its location and the opponent&#x27;s piece is taken from the board.
* Assault: If a piece with a small value, multiplied by the number of vacant spaces between it and another larger piece is equal to the larger piece, the larger piece is captured.
* Ambuscade: If two pieces&#x27; sum is equal to an enemy piece that is placed between the two (i.e. the enemy piece is within a move of both attacking pieces), the enemy piece is captured and removed from the board.
* Siege: If a piece is surrounded on all four sides, it is removed.

===Victory===
There were also a variety of victory conditions for determining when a game would end and who the winner was. There were common victories, and proper victories, which were recommended for more skilled players. Proper victories required placing pieces in linear arrangements in the opponent&#x27;s side of the board, with the numbers formed by the arrangement following various types of numerical progression. The types of progression required — arithmetic, geometric and harmonic — fit with the mathematical and numerological teachings of Boethius.
* Common victories:
**De corpore (Latin: &quot;by body&quot;): If a player captures a certain number of pieces set by both players, they win the game.
**De bonis (&quot;by goods&quot;): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, they win the game.
** De lite (&quot;by lawsuit&quot;): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, and the number of digits in their captured pieces&#x27; values are less than a number set by both players, they win the game.
** De honore (&quot;by honour&quot;): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, and the number of pieces they captured are less than a certain number set by both players, they win the game.
** de honore liteque (&quot;by honour and lawsuit&quot;): If a player captures enough pieces to add up to or exceed a certain value that is set by both players, the number of digits in their captured pieces&#x27; values are less than a number set by both players, and the number of pieces they captured are less than a certain number set by both players, they win the game.
* Proper victories:
** Victoria magna (&quot;great victory&quot;): This occurs when three pieces that are arranged are in an arithmetic progression.
** Victoria major (&quot;greater victory&quot;): This occurs when four pieces that are arranged have three pieces that are in a certain progression, and another three pieces that are in another type of progression.
** Victoria excellentissima (&quot;most excellent victory&quot;): This occurs when four pieces that are arranged have all three types of mathematical progressions in three different groups.

<text>William Huskisson (11 March 177015 September 1830) was a British , financier, and Member of Parliament for several constituencies, including Liverpool.

He is commonly known as the world&#x27;s first widely reported railway passenger casualty as he was run over and fatally injured by Robert Stephenson&#x27;s pioneering locomotive &quot;Rocket&quot; (however, the first railway casualty had happened 9 years earlier).

==Background and education==
Huskisson was born at Birtsmorton Court, Malvern, Worcestershire, the son of William and Elizabeth Huskisson, both members of Staffordshire families. He was one of four brothers. After their mother Elizabeth died, their father William eventually remarried and had further children by his second wife.

==Early life==
Huskisson was a student at Appleby Grammar School (later renamed Sir John Moore Church of England Primary School), a boarding school designed by Sir Christopher Wren on the Leicestershire/Derbyshire borders. In 1783, he was sent to Paris to live with his maternal great-uncle Dr. Richard Gem, who was physician to the British embassy there. He remained in Paris until 1792, and his experience as an eyewitness to the prelude and beginning of the French Revolution gave him a lifelong interest in politics. Huskisson first came to public notice while still in Paris. As a supporter of the moderate party, he became a member of the &quot;Club of 1789&quot;, which favoured making France into a constitutional monarchy. On 29 August 1790, he delivered a speech entitled &quot;Sur les Assignats&quot;, about the issue of assignats by the French government. This speech gave him a reputation as an expert in finance. From 1790 to 1792, the Marquess of Stafford was the British ambassador to Paris. Huskisson became a protégé of the Marquess, and returned to London with him.

==Political career==

Once in London, Huskisson quickly gained an additional two powerful political patrons: Henry Dundas, the Home Secretary, and William Pitt the Younger, the Prime Minister. Because of Huskisson&#x27;s fluency in French, Dundas appointed him in January 1793 to oversee the execution of the Aliens Act, which mostly dealt with French refugees. In the discharge of his delicate duties, he manifested such ability that in 1795 he was appointed Under-Secretary at War (the Secretary at War&#x27;s deputy).

In the following year he entered Parliament as member for Morpeth, but for a considerable period he took scarcely any part in the debates. In 1800 he inherited a fortune from Dr Gem. On the retirement of Pitt in 1801 he resigned office, and after contesting Dover unsuccessfully he withdrew for a time into private life. Having in 1804 been chosen to represent Liskeard, he was appointed secretary of the treasury on the restoration of the Pitt ministry, holding office till the dissolution of the ministry after the death of Pitt in January 1806.

After being elected for Harwich in 1807, he accepted the same office under the Duke of Portland, but he withdrew from the ministry along with Canning in 1809. In the following year he published a pamphlet on the currency system, which confirmed his reputation as the ablest financier of his time; but his free-trade principles did not accord with those of his party. In 1812 he was returned for Chichester.

When in 1814 he re-entered government, it was only as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, but his influence was from this time very great in the commercial and financial legislation of the country. He took a prominent part in the debates over the Corn Laws in 1814 and 1815; and in 1819 he presented a memorandum to Lord Liverpool advocating a large reduction in the unfunded debt, and explaining a method for the resumption of cash payments, which was embodied in the act passed the same year. In 1821 he was a member of the committee appointed to inquire into the causes of the agricultural distress then prevailing, and the proposed relaxation of the Corn Laws embodied in the report was understood to have been chiefly due to his strenuous advocacy.

In 1823 he was appointed President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy, and shortly afterwards he received a seat in the cabinet. In the same year he was returned for Liverpool as successor to Canning, and as the only man who could reconcile the Tory merchants to a free trade policy. Among the more important legislative changes with which he was principally connected were a reform of the Navigation Acts, admitting other nations to a full equality and reciprocity of shipping duties; the repeal of the labour laws; the introduction of a new sinking fund; the reduction of the duties on manufactures and on the importation of foreign goods, and the repeal of the quarantine duties.

As a Secretary for Colonies in 1826, he proposed the revised Consolidated Slave Law which was accepted by Parliament and passed by the Barbadian legislature.

In 1826 after the Power-loom riots, a number of manufacturers subsequently agreed to pay a standard rate to the weavers, but on their own admission it was a &quot;starvation&quot; wage. Those who stuck to the agreement found it difficult to compete with those manufacturers who did not, and could therefore undercut them, 
prompting an appeal to William Huskisson, the President of the Board of Trade, to introduce a legally binding minimum wage. Huskisson&#x27;s response was dismissive, expressing his view that to introduce such a measure would be &quot;a vain and hazardous attempt to impose the authority of the law between the labourer and his employer in regulating the demand for labour and the price to be paid for it&quot;.

In accordance with his suggestion Canning in 1827 introduced a measure on the corn laws proposing the adoption of a sliding scale to regulate the amount of duty. A misapprehension between Huskisson and the Duke of Wellington led to the duke proposing an amendment, the success of which caused the abandonment of the measure by the government.

After the death of Canning in the same year Huskisson accepted the secretaryship of the colonies under Lord Goderich, an office which he continued to hold in the new cabinet formed by the Duke of Wellington in the following year. After succeeding with great difficulty in inducing the cabinet to agree to a compromise on the corn laws, Huskisson finally resigned office in May 1828 on account of a difference with his colleagues in regard to the disfranchisement of East Retford.

He was followed out of the government by other Tories who are usually described as Canningites including Lord Palmerston, Charles Grant and Lord Dudley.

==Death==


Huskisson had been diagnosed with strangury, a tender inflammation of the kidneys. He had undergone surgery, and had been advised by Royal doctor William George Maton to cancel all forthcoming appointments, which included the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Huskisson chose to ignore this advice, believing the opening event too important to avoid. He rode down the line in a special train constructed for the Duke of Wellington and his guests and dignitaries, pulled by the locomotive &quot;Northumbrian&quot; which was driven by George Stephenson himself. This train was the only train on the south track; the other seven were in procession on the northern track. At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on fuel and water. Although the company had implicitly warned passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around 50 of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s special train stopped. One of those who got off was Huskisson, who approached the Duke to take this opportunity to repair their relationship after a great falling out, which resulted in Huskisson leaving the government, and shook his hand.

At this time the train being pulled by &quot;Rocket&quot; approached on the other line. &quot;Rocket&quot; was being driven by Joseph Locke, George Stephenson&#x27;s assistant and future eminent engineer in his own right. A shout went up, &quot;An engine is approaching. Take care, gentlemen!&quot; The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or stepped over the northern line and completely out of the way. A third option was available, to stand with one&#x27;s back to the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke&#x27;s private carriage was wider than a then-standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary train and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy, and had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls; he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Added to this, he was only a few weeks post surgery and was present against his doctor&#x27;s advice.

On realising his danger, he panicked and made two attempts to cross the other line, but changed his mind and returned to the Duke&#x27;s carriage. At this point Joseph Locke became aware and threw &quot;Rocket&quot; into reverse, but it would have taken 10 seconds to have any effect. Huskisson then panicked that the gap between the two trains was not big enough and so tried to clamber into the Duke&#x27;s carriage. However, the carriage door had not been latched, and so it slowly swung open, leaving him hanging directly in the path of the oncoming &quot;Rocket&quot;, which hit the door, throwing Huskisson onto the tracks in front of the train. His leg was horrifically mangled by the locomotive.

A door was ripped from a railway building and Huskisson was placed on it, and George Stephenson uncoupled &quot;Northumbrian&quot; from the Duke&#x27;s train and coupled it to a small carriage that had been occupied by a band; the mortally injured MP was placed inside with a small group of friends. They set off to Eccles and walked from the station to the vicarage, where a doctor was called. A tourniquet had been applied, but it was not deemed possible to do a field amputation, so he was made comfortable with the assistance of the vicar&#x27;s wife Emma Blackburne, whose &quot;activity, sense &amp; conduct&quot; were mentioned in &quot;The Manchester Courier&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; and remembered with gratitude by Huskisson&#x27;s widow Emily who arrived at the vicarage from Liverpool. Huskisson was able to make his will and at 9 pm he died from his injury.

The death and funeral of Huskisson led to wide reporting on the opening of the railway, for the first time making people around the world aware that cheap and rapid long-distance transport was now possible, if dangerous.

==Family and commemorations==
On 6 April 1799, Huskisson married Emily Milbanke, the younger daughter of Mark Milbanke, the commander-in-chief at Portsmouth. Emily Huskisson survived her husband and did not remarry, dying in April 1856. They had no children. In 1800 Huskisson bought Eartham House in West Sussex from his friend William Hayley, and is commemorated in the parish church by a long carved eulogy from Emily on the south wall.

The monument where his remains are buried is the centrepiece of St James Cemetery, Liverpool. A marble statue of him was housed in a mausoleum there until 1968, when it was transferred to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

Emily also commissioned a second marble statue for the Custom House in Liverpool. This statue now stands in Pimlico Gardens in London, between Grosvenor Road and the river Thames. A bronze casting of it was unveiled at the Custom House in 1847 and, after several moves, is now in Duke Street in Liverpool city centre.

The town of Huskisson, New South Wales was named after Huskisson by the 9th Governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps.

<doc id="253866" wikidata="Q614045" url="?curid=253866" title="Constitution of the Confederate States">
<text>The Constitution of the Confederate States was the supreme law of the Confederate States of America. It superseded the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States, the Confederate State&#x27;s first constitution, in 1862. It remained in effect until the end of the American Civil War in 1865.

The original Provisional Constitution is located at the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, Virginia, and differs slightly from the version later adopted. The final, handwritten Constitution is located in the Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library at the University of Georgia. Most of its provisions are word-for-word duplicates from the United States Constitution; however, there are crucial differences between the two documents in tone and legal content, primarily regarding slavery.

==Comparison with the U.S. Constitution==
* The preambles of both the U.S. and the Confederate Constitutions have some similarities, but it seems that the Confederate Constitution authors set out to give a different feel to the new preamble. Both preambles are provided here. The bold text shows the differences between them. The Confederate Constitution&#x27;s preamble includes references to God, a perpetual government, and the sovereignty and the independence of each state.
** The Preamble to the U.S. Constitution: &quot;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&quot;
** The Preamble to the Confederate Constitution: &quot;We, the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity – invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God – do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America.&quot;

===Article summaries===
The Confederate Constitution followed the U.S. Constitution for the most part in the main body of the text but with some changes:

====Article I differences====
* Amended Article I Section 2(1) to prohibit persons &quot;of foreign birth&quot; who were &quot;not a citizen of the Confederate States&quot; from voting &quot;for any officer, civil or political, State or Federal.&quot;
* Article I Section 2(3) is essentially the same, and the clause still counts only &quot;three-fifths of all slaves&quot; for the population total of each state, just as it did in the U.S. with the Three-Fifths Compromise: &quot;The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every fifty thousand&quot;. while in the U.S. Constitution &quot;The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand.&quot; A 1796 proposed Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which is still pending ratification by the states (as of 2024) would change the maximum number of representatives to one for every fifty thousand.
* Amended Article I Section 2(5) to allow the state legislatures to impeach federal officials who live and work only within their state with a two-thirds vote of both houses of the state legislature.
* Concerning the appointment of Senators, Article I Section 3(1) adds &quot;at the regular session next immediately preceding the commencement of the term of service.&quot; The state legislature, which then was responsible for the appointment of senators, had to wait until the seat was vacant.
* Article I Section 4(1) deals with elections and adds &quot;subject to the provisions of this Constitution&quot; to the U.S. Constitution Clause. That meant that each state legislature was free to make its own decision unless the constitution laid out other rules. The aforementioned Article I Section 2(1) and Article I Section 3(1) clauses would fall into that category.
* Amended Article I Section 6(2) to allow the House of Representatives and the Senate the ability to grant seats to the heads of each executive department to discuss issues involving their departments with Congress. The clause is the same as the one from the U.S. Constitution and adds:

* Amended Article I Section 7(2) to provide the President of the Confederate States with a line-item veto but also required any bill in which the president used this veto to be resubmitted to both houses for a possible override vote by two thirds of both houses.
* In an attempt to prevent the Confederate Congress from protecting industry, the framers added to Article I Section 8(1):
:The phrase &quot;general Welfare&quot; was dropped from the Confederate Clause as well.
Article I Section 8(3) added quite a bit to the U.S. Constitution in an attempt to block the Confederate Congress from appropriating money to build &quot;internal improvements&quot; to &quot;facilitate commerce,&quot; with some exceptions allowing for safety and improvement to waterways.
::Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.
::Article I Section 8(3) of the Confederate Constitution.

* There are changes and additions to Article 1 Section 9 Clauses (1), (2), and (4) that are covered in the Slavery section below.
* The first twelve amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including the Bill of Rights, were directly incorporated into the Confederate Constitution. That was done primarily in Article I Section 9 of the Confederate Constitution, with the first eight amendments to the U.S. Constitution becoming clauses (12) to (19).
* In addition to this, there were three altogether-new clauses in the Confederate Constitution for Article I, Section 9.
* Article I, Section 9(9)

* Article I, Section 9(10)

* Amendments I through VIII are contained, in the same order, in Article I, Section 9(12) through Article I, Section 9(19) (the remainder of the U.S. Bill of Rights is in Article VI).
* Article I, Section 9(20) was added to limit new bills to only one subject presented.
Then in Section 10:
* Article I Section 10(3): Individual states were unable to tax ships and negotiate treaties concerning waterways with other states without congressional consent. The clause limited the states’ ability to keep troops or to engage in war, but provided some ability to enter compacts for the improvement of shared rivers.
===Article II===
* The President of the Confederate States of America is to be elected by electors, chosen by the individual states, for a single six-year term, rather than a then-unlimited number of four-year terms. Article 2 Section 1(1) reads as: &quot;The executive power shall be vested in a President of the Confederate States of America. He and the Vice President shall hold their offices for the term of six years; but the President shall not be re-eligible.&quot;
* Amendment XII of the U.S. Constitution is added here as Article II Section 1(3), (4), and (5)
* Article II Section 1(7) of the Confederate Constitution required candidates for the President of the Confederacy to have resided &quot;within the limits of the Confederate States&quot; for 14 years.
Changes to Article III
* Article III Section 2(1) of the Confederate Constitution combines the first clause of Article III Section 1 in the U.S. Constitution with Amendment XI. The phrase &quot;citizens of the same state&quot; is left out and &quot;and foreign states, citizens or subjects; but no state shall be sued by a citizen or subject of any foreign state&quot; is added in the Confederate Constitution.
Changes to Article IV
* There were changes and additions to Article IV Section 2(1) and Article IV Section 3(3), which are covered in the Slavery section below.
* Article IV Section 3(1) required a two-thirds of both houses of Congress vote for a new state to join the Confederacy.
Changes to Article V
* The Confederate Congress, unlike in the U.S. Constitution, could not propose amendments. Instead, amendments had to be proposed by constitutional conventions in at least three states. The Confederate Constitution also clarified an ambiguity in the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Article V by declaring that a national convention could propose only amendments that were suggested by state conventions, as opposed to having the authority to amend the entire Constitution. The process of amendment became easier (Article V Section 1(1)) by requiring only two thirds of the states to ratify, rather than three fourths.
Changes to Article VI
* The Confederate Constitution added a clause to aid with the transition from the provisional government.

* Amendments IX and X of the U.S. Constitution were added here as Article VI Section 1(5), and (6)
Changes to Article VII
* Article VII Section 1(2), with instructions for electing permanent officials after the ratification of the Confederate Constitution, was added.
===Differences by subject===
====Slavery====
There were several major differences between the constitutions concerning slavery.
* Whereas the original U.S. Constitution did not use the word &quot;slavery&quot; or the term &quot;Negro Slaves&quot; but instead used &quot;Person[s] held to Service or Labour,&quot; which included whites and Native Americans in indentured servitude, the Confederate Constitution addresses the legality of slavery directly and by name.
* Though Article I, Section 9(1), of both constitutions are quite similar in banning the importation of slaves from foreign nations, the Confederate Constitution permitted the Confederate States to import slaves from the United States and specified the &quot;African race&quot; as the subject. The importation of slaves into the United States, including the South, had been illegal since 1808.

:While the U.S. Constitution reads

* The Confederate Constitution then added a clause that gave Congress the power to prohibit the importation of slaves from any non-Confederate state.

:While the U.S. Constitution has a clause that states &quot;No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed,&quot; the Confederate Constitution also added a phrase that explicitly protected slavery.
* The U.S. Constitution states in Article IV, Section 2, &quot;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.&quot; The Confederate Constitution added that a state government could not prohibit the rights of slave owners traveling or visiting from a different state with their slaves.
* The Confederate Constitution added a clause about the question of slavery in the territories, the key constitutional debate of the 1860 election, by explicitly stating slavery to be legally protected in the territories.

====States&#x27; rights====
The Confederate Constitution&#x27;s preamble included the phrase &quot;each State acting in its sovereign and independent character,&quot; which focused the new constitution on the rights of the individual states.
* The Preamble to the Confederate Constitution, began, &quot;We, the people of the Confederate States, each State acting in its sovereign and independent character...&quot;

States of the Confederacy gained several rights that states of the Union do not have, such as the right to impeach federal judges and other federal officers if they worked or lived solely in their state.
* The Confederate Constitution omitted the phrase &quot;emit Bills of Credit&quot; from Article 1 Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution, which denied the states the right to issue such bills of credit.
:U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Article I Section 10 including the included &quot;emit Bills of Credit.&quot;

* The Confederate Constitution enabled states to tax ships by omitting the phrase from the U.S. Constitution that prohibits it.
:The U.S. Constitution reads:
:The ability to tax ships to raise revenue for the Confederate States is reinforced in Article 1 Section 10(3).
The Confederate States lost a few rights that the Union states retained.
* States lost the right to determine if foreigners can vote in their states: Article I Section 2(1) as mentioned above.
* States also lost the ability to restrict the rights of traveling and sojourning slave owners: Article IV Section 2(1) as mentioned above. (Many Southerners were already of the opinion that the U.S. Constitution already protected the rights of sojourning and traveling slave owners and that the Confederate Constitution merely made it explicit.)

* The Confederate Constitution contained many of the phrases and clauses that had led to disagreement among U.S. states, including a Supremacy Clause, a Commerce Clause, and a Necessary and Proper Clause. The Supremacy Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause are nearly identical in both constitutions.
** The Commerce Clause differed slightly from the U.S. version in that the Confederate Congress was prevented from appropriating money for &quot;internal improvements&quot; to &quot;facilitate commerce,&quot;.

The signers and the states they represented were:
* Howell Cobb, President of the Congress

* Texas: John Hemphill, Thomas N. Waul, John H. Reagan, Williamson S. Oldham, Louis T. Wigfall, John Gregg, William Beck Ochiltree

==Ratification==

Congress began to move for ratification of the Confederate States Constitution on March 11, 1861:

==Judicial review==
Although the Confederate States Supreme Court was never constituted, the supreme courts of the various Confederate states issued numerous decisions interpreting the Confederate Constitution. Unsurprisingly, since the Confederate Constitution was based on the United States Constitution, the Confederate State Supreme Courts often used U.S. Supreme Court precedents. The jurisprudence of the Marshall Court thus influenced the interpretation of the Confederate Constitution. The state courts repeatedly upheld robust powers of the Confederate Congress, especially on matters of military necessity.

==Analysis==
Contemporary historians overwhelmingly agree that secession was motivated by the preservation of slavery. There were numerous causes for secession, but the preservation and the expansion of slavery were easily the most important of them. The confusion may come from blending the causes of secession with the causes of the war, which are separate but related issues. (Lincoln entered a military conflict not to free the slaves but to put down a rebellion.) According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, each side supported states&#x27; rights or federal power only when it was convenient to do so. Stampp also cited Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens&#x27;s &quot;A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States&quot; as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the &quot;cornerstone of the Confederacy&quot; when the war began but, after the Southern defeat, said that the war had been instead about states&#x27; rights.

According to an 1861 speech delivered by Alabama politician Robert Hardy Smith, the State of Alabama declared its secession from the United States to preserve and to perpetuate the practice of slavery, the debate over which he referred to as the &quot;Negro quarrel.&quot; In his speech, Smith praised the Confederate constitution for its lack of euphemisms and its succinct protections of the right to own &quot;Negro&quot; slaves:

Georgia Democrat Alexander H. Stephens, who would become the Confederate vice president, stated within his Cornerstone Speech that the Confederate constitution was &quot;decidedly better than&quot; the American one, as the former &quot;put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution. African slavery as it exists amongst us; the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the &#x27;rock upon which the old Union would split.&#x27; He was right.&quot;

<doc id="253868" wikidata="Q1385731" url="?curid=253868" title="Eye of the Beholder (video game)">
<text>Eye of the Beholder is a role-playing video game for personal computers and video game consoles developed by Westwood Associates. It was published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in 1991, for the MS-DOS operating system and later ported to the Amiga, the Sega CD and the SNES. The Sega CD version features a soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Motohiro Kawashima. A port to the Atari Lynx handheld was developed by NuFX in 1993, but was not released. In 2002, an adaptation of the same name was developed by Pronto Games for the Game Boy Advance.

The game has two sequels, &quot;Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon&quot;, also released in 1991, and &quot;Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor&quot;, released in 1993. The third game, however, was not developed by Westwood, which had been acquired by Virgin Interactive in 1992 and created the &quot;Lands of Lore&quot; series instead.

==Plot==
The lords of the city of Waterdeep hire a team of adventurers to investigate an evil coming from beneath the city. The adventurers enter the city&#x27;s sewer, but the entrance gets blocked by a collapse caused by Xanathar, the eponymous beholder. The team descends further beneath the city, going through Dwarf and Drow clans, to Xanathar&#x27;s lair, where the final confrontation takes place.

Once the eponymous beholder is killed, the player would be treated to a small blue window describing that the beholder was killed and that the adventurers returned to the surface where they were treated as heroes. Nothing else was mentioned in the ending and there were no accompanying graphics. This was changed in the later released Amiga version, which featured an animated ending.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; features a first-person perspective in a dungeon rendered using 3D computer graphics, very similar to the earlier &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. The player controls four characters, initially, using a point-and-click interface to fight monsters. This can be increased to a maximum of six characters, by resurrecting one or more skeletons from dead non-player characters (NPCs), or finding NPCs that are found throughout the dungeons.

The possibility to increase the size of the player&#x27;s party through the recruiting of NPCs was a tradition in all of the &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; series. It was also possible to import a party from &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; into &quot;The Legend of Darkmoon&quot; or from &quot;The Legend of Darkmoon&quot; into &quot;Assault on Myth Drannor&quot;; thus, a player could play through all three games with the same party.

==Development==
The graphics for the MS-DOS version were created using Deluxe Paint. Over 150 Adlib sound effects exist in the game&#x27;s audio.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; was reviewed in 1991 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #171 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column, who gave it 5 out of 5 stars. It was #1 on the Software Publishers Association&#x27;s list of top MS-DOS games for April 1991, the last SSI &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game to reach the rank. Dennis Owens of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called it &quot;a stunning, brilliantly graphic and agonizingly tricky&quot; 3-D CRPG. The magazine stated that the game&#x27;s VGA graphics and sound card audio finally gave IBM PC owners a &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;-like game. Scorpia, another reviewer for the magazine, was less positive. Although also praising the graphics and audio, stating that they &quot;really give you the &quot;feeling&quot; of being in an actual dungeon&quot;, she criticized the awkward spell user interface and the &quot;outrageous&quot; abrupt ending. Other areas that needed work included the combat, plot, and NPC interaction; nonetheless, she was hopeful that with such improvements &quot;the Legend series will become one of the leaders in the CRPG field&quot;. In 1993, Scorpia called the game &quot;an impressive first effort that bodes well for the future&quot;.

Jim Trunzo reviewed &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #27 (June/July, 1991), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;While the unforgiving nature of &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; makes the basic dungeon crawl a challenge, the graphics and sound employed in the game might well make it a classic!&quot;

&quot;The One&quot; gave the Amiga version of &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; an overall score of 92%, heavily comparing it to &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, stating that &quot;comparisons to the [aging] classic – &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; – are inevitable. When two games look this similar, even their programmers would have trouble telling them apart&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; praises &quot;Eye of the Beholder&#x27;s&quot; gameplay, stating that &quot;in contrast to previous AD&amp;D titles, there&#x27;s more emphasis on puzzle-solving than combat – a refreshing change ... Combat is also handled extremely well, the spells and &#x27;ranged weapons&#x27; rules are all faithful to the original game ... The gameplay works wonderfully, conjuring up both the spirit and the atmosphere that you get from [tabletop AD&amp;D]&quot;. Despite this, &quot;The One&quot; expresses that &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; is on par with &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; and &quot;Chaos Strikes Back&quot;, but states that &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; is still &quot;an essential purchase for followers of the AD&amp;D series&quot;.

Hailing the game as &quot;a dream come true&quot; for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fans, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version a 6.2 out of 10, praising its 3-D graphics and variety of characters. They gave the Sega CD version a 7.2 out of 10, this time praising the ability to create custom characters but criticizing the audio. They also remarked that the game has a difficult learning curve. While reviewing the Sega CD version, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; said it is &quot;not quite up there with &quot;Snatcher&quot;, but without doubt a highly ace role-player&quot;.

According to &quot;GameSpy&quot; in 2004, despite the issues in the first &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, &quot;most players found the game well worth the effort&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; No. 8 on their list of &quot;The Top 11 &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; Games of All Time&quot; in 2014. Ian Williams of &quot;Paste&quot; rated the game #8 on his list of &quot;The 10 Greatest&quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; Videogames&quot; in 2015. In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; placed &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors called it a &quot;classic romp through dungeons dealing with monsters, puzzles, traps and things mythical&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
SSI sold 129,234 copies of &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;. By mid-1991, over 150,000 copies had been sold worldwide. The &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; series overall, including the game&#x27;s two sequels, reached global sales above 350,000 units by 1996.

===Promotion===
In January 1991, SSI participated in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;&#x27;s Top Ad contest and their cover art for &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; came in first place among voting readers, despite the magazine publisher&#x27;s objection to the piece. From February till October, SSI started up a contest &quot;Beholder Bonus&quot;, which required players to find a bonus feature (easter egg) in each level of the game, indicated by an onscreen message. The first 50 PC players and 50 Amiga players to discover all 12 features would win $100 worth of prizes.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
There were two sequels:
&quot;Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon&quot; used a modified version of the first game&#x27;s engine, added outdoor areas and greatly increased the amount of interaction the player had with their environment, along with substantially more &#x27;roleplaying&#x27; aspects to the game.

&quot;Eye of the Beholder III: Assault on Myth Drannor&quot; was not developed by Westwood, the developer of &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Darkmoon&quot;, but rather in-house by the publisher SSI.

&quot;Eye of the Beholder Trilogy&quot; (1995, SSI) was a rerelease of all the three games for MS-DOS on CD-ROM. Interplay released the three games along with a number of other &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; DOS Games in two collection CDs: &quot;The Forgotten Realms Archives&quot; (1997) and &quot;Gamefest: Forgotten Realms Classics&quot; (2001).

===Related games===
Several modules for &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; (2002) have been created by fans as remakes of the original &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; game. A team of Indie game developers led by Andreas Larsson did a fan conversion of the game for the Commodore 64 available for free as a cartridge image.

<text>Treasure Island Dizzy is a puzzle video game published in 1989 by Codemasters for the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum, and later ported to the Commodore 64, NES, Amiga, Atari ST and Atari Jaguar.

&quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; is the second game in the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series, and is the sequel to &quot;Dizzy – The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure&quot;. The game was developed by the Oliver Twins with graphics being designed by Neil Adamson and music by David Whittaker.

== Design ==

This game is quite different from its predecessor, with a new inventory system and improved animations. The game contains fewer enemies than the previous title. It is more centred on inventory-based problem solving. The aim of the game is to solve various puzzles in order to obtain a boat so that Dizzy can return to his friends and family, the Yolkfolk. To do this Dizzy must journey through haunted mines and tree villages, as well as underwater. The game also features a subquest (albeit one essential to completing the game) in which thirty gold coins must be collected. Such subquests were found in many of the sequels.

Critics consider this one of the most difficult &quot;Dizzy&quot; games as the energy bar system of later titles was not yet implemented and Dizzy is provided with only one life—contrasting with five in the first game and three in &quot;Fantasy World Dizzy&quot;, the immediate sequel, and most subsequent titles. Also unique to this game, the player is unable to select any particular item from the inventory for use—Dizzy simply puts down whichever item is at the top of the list. If Dizzy is underwater and the snorkel happens to be at the top of the inventory list, he will drop the snorkel when the player collects another item and instantly die. &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; therefore requires more foresight and planning than the other games in the series.

Adding to the difficulty of the game was the fact that the player had two main tasks to complete; the escape from the islands, and the collection of the thirty coins. Upon escaping the final island, the Shopkeeper character appears and tells Dizzy that he cannot leave without finding all thirty coins. Given that a number of the coins were hidden behind scenery, this second task proved to be more difficult than the main game. Commodore Format printed a &quot;complete&quot; solution and map which like the Codemasters 0898 helpline which gave a walkthrough did not include the hidden coins, frustrating many players.

==Ports==
A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was published by Camerica as part of the video game compilation &quot;Quattro Adventure&quot;. This version was released for the Evercade handheld game system in October 2020 as part of &quot;The Oliver Twins Collection&quot; compilation cartridge.

Codemasters released a version of &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; for Microsoft Windows on the company&#x27;s website in December 2004. Available for download after registration, it was in fact the Commodore 64 version bundled with the CCS64 emulator in a single executable. The download is no longer available.

==Reception==
The game spent over two years in the Gallup All Formats Top 40. The ZX Spectrum version alone sold over 100,000 copies.

<text>In the mathematical discipline of linear algebra, a matrix decomposition or matrix factorization is a factorization of a matrix into a product of matrices. There are many different matrix decompositions; each finds use among a particular class of problems.

== Example ==
In numerical analysis, different decompositions are used to implement efficient matrix algorithms.

For example, when solving a system of linear equations formula_1, the matrix &quot;A&quot; can be decomposed via the LU decomposition. The LU decomposition factorizes a matrix into a lower triangular matrix &quot;L&quot; and an upper triangular matrix &quot;U&quot;. The systems formula_2 and formula_3 require fewer additions and multiplications to solve, compared with the original system formula_1, though one might require significantly more digits in inexact arithmetic such as floating point.

Similarly, the QR decomposition expresses &quot;A&quot; as &quot;QR&quot; with &quot;Q&quot; an orthogonal matrix and &quot;R&quot; an upper triangular matrix. The system &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;Rx) = b is solved by &quot;Rx = &quot;Q&quot;Tb = c, and the system &quot;R&quot;x = c is solved by &#x27;back substitution&#x27;. The number of additions and multiplications required is about twice that of using the LU solver, but no more digits are required in inexact arithmetic because the QR decomposition is numerically stable.

== Decompositions related to solving systems of linear equations ==

=== LU decomposition ===

*Traditionally applicable to: square matrix &quot;A&quot;, although rectangular matrices can be applicable.
*Decomposition: formula_5, where &quot;L&quot; is lower triangular and &quot;U&quot; is upper triangular.
*Related: the &quot;LDU&quot; decomposition is formula_6, where &quot;L&quot; is lower triangular with ones on the diagonal, &quot;U&quot; is upper triangular with ones on the diagonal, and &quot;D&quot; is a diagonal matrix.
*Related: the &quot;LUP&quot; decomposition is formula_7, where &quot;L&quot; is lower triangular, &quot;U&quot; is upper triangular, and &quot;P&quot; is a permutation matrix.
*Existence: An LUP decomposition exists for any square matrix &quot;A&quot;. When &quot;P&quot; is an identity matrix, the LUP decomposition reduces to the LU decomposition.
*Comments: The LUP and LU decompositions are useful in solving an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; system of linear equations formula_1. These decompositions summarize the process of Gaussian elimination in matrix form. Matrix &quot;P&quot; represents any row interchanges carried out in the process of Gaussian elimination. If Gaussian elimination produces the row echelon form without requiring any row interchanges, then &quot;P&quot; = &quot;I&quot;, so an LU decomposition exists.

=== LU reduction ===
=== Block LU decomposition ===
=== Rank factorization ===

*Applicable to: &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; of rank &quot;r&quot;
*Decomposition: formula_9 where &quot;C&quot; is an &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;r&quot; full column rank matrix and &quot;F&quot; is an &quot;r&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; full row rank matrix
*Comment: The rank factorization can be used to compute the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of &quot;A&quot;, which one can apply to obtain all solutions of the linear system formula_1.

=== Cholesky decomposition ===

*Applicable to: square, hermitian, positive definite matrix formula_11
*Decomposition: formula_12, where formula_13 is upper triangular with real positive diagonal entries
*Comment: if the matrix formula_11 is Hermitian and positive semi-definite, then it has a decomposition of the form formula_12 if the diagonal entries of formula_13 are allowed to be zero
*Uniqueness: for positive definite matrices Cholesky decomposition is unique. However, it is not unique in the positive semi-definite case.
*Comment: if formula_11 is real and symmetric, formula_13 has all real elements
*Comment: An alternative is the LDL decomposition, which can avoid extracting square roots.

=== QR decomposition ===

*Applicable to: &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; with linearly independent columns
*Decomposition: formula_19 where formula_20 is a unitary matrix of size &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;m&quot;, and formula_21 is an upper triangular matrix of size &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot;
*Uniqueness: In general it is not unique, but if formula_11 is of full rank, then there exists a single formula_21 that has all positive diagonal elements. If formula_11 is square, also formula_20 is unique.
*Comment: The QR decomposition provides an effective way to solve the system of equations formula_1. The fact that formula_20 is orthogonal means that formula_28, so that formula_1 is equivalent to formula_30, which is very easy to solve since formula_21 is triangular.

=== RRQR factorization ===
=== Interpolative decomposition ===

== Decompositions based on eigenvalues and related concepts ==

=== Eigendecomposition ===

*Also called &quot;spectral decomposition&quot;.
*Applicable to: square matrix &quot;A&quot; with linearly independent eigenvectors (not necessarily distinct eigenvalues).
*Decomposition: formula_32, where &quot;D&quot; is a diagonal matrix formed from the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;, and the columns of &quot;V&quot; are the corresponding eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot;.
*Existence: An &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot; always has &quot;n&quot; (complex) eigenvalues, which can be ordered (in more than one way) to form an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; diagonal matrix &quot;D&quot; and a corresponding matrix of nonzero columns &quot;V&quot; that satisfies the eigenvalue equation formula_33. formula_34 is invertible if and only if the &quot;n&quot; eigenvectors are linearly independent (that is, each eigenvalue has geometric multiplicity equal to its algebraic multiplicity). A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for this to happen is that all the eigenvalues are different (in this case geometric and algebraic multiplicity are equal to 1)
*Comment: One can always normalize the eigenvectors to have length one (see the definition of the eigenvalue equation)
*Comment: Every normal matrix &quot;A&quot; (that is, matrix for which formula_35, where formula_36 is a conjugate transpose) can be eigendecomposed. For a normal matrix &quot;A&quot; (and only for a normal matrix), the eigenvectors can also be made orthonormal (formula_37) and the eigendecomposition reads as formula_38. In particular all unitary, Hermitian, or skew-Hermitian (in the real-valued case, all orthogonal, symmetric, or skew-symmetric, respectively) matrices are normal and therefore possess this property.
*Comment: For any real symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;, the eigendecomposition always exists and can be written as formula_39, where both &quot;D&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are real-valued.
*Comment: The eigendecomposition is useful for understanding the solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations or linear difference equations. For example, the difference equation formula_40 starting from the initial condition formula_41 is solved by formula_42, which is equivalent to formula_43, where &quot;V&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are the matrices formed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;. Since &quot;D&quot; is diagonal, raising it to power formula_44, just involves raising each element on the diagonal to the power &quot;t&quot;. This is much easier to do and understand than raising &quot;A&quot; to power &quot;t&quot;, since &quot;A&quot; is usually not diagonal.

=== Jordan decomposition ===
The Jordan normal form and the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition
*Applicable to: square matrix &quot;A&quot;
*Comment: the Jordan normal form generalizes the eigendecomposition to cases where there are repeated eigenvalues and cannot be diagonalized, the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition does this without choosing a basis.

=== Schur decomposition ===

*Applicable to: square matrix &quot;A&quot;
*Decomposition (complex version): formula_45, where &quot;U&quot; is a unitary matrix, formula_46 is the conjugate transpose of &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; is an upper triangular matrix called the complex Schur form which has the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; along its diagonal.
*Comment: if &quot;A&quot; is a normal matrix, then &quot;T&quot; is diagonal and the Schur decomposition coincides with the spectral decomposition.

=== Real Schur decomposition ===
*Applicable to: square matrix &quot;A&quot;
*Decomposition: This is a version of Schur decomposition where formula_34 and formula_48 only contain real numbers. One can always write formula_49 where &quot;V&quot; is a real orthogonal matrix, formula_50 is the transpose of &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;S&quot; is a block upper triangular matrix called the real Schur form. The blocks on the diagonal of &quot;S&quot; are of size 1×1 (in which case they represent real eigenvalues) or 2×2 (in which case they are derived from complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs).

=== QZ decomposition ===

*Also called: &quot;generalized Schur decomposition&quot;
*Applicable to: square matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;
*Comment: there are two versions of this decomposition: complex and real.
*Decomposition (complex version): formula_51 and formula_52 where &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are unitary matrices, the * superscript represents conjugate transpose, and &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are upper triangular matrices.
*Comment: in the complex QZ decomposition, the ratios of the diagonal elements of &quot;S&quot; to the corresponding diagonal elements of &quot;T&quot;, formula_53, are the generalized eigenvalues that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem formula_54 (where formula_55 is an unknown scalar and v is an unknown nonzero vector).
*Decomposition (real version): formula_56 and formula_57 where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; are matrices containing real numbers only. In this case &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are orthogonal matrices, the &quot;T&quot; superscript represents transposition, and &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are block upper triangular matrices. The blocks on the diagonal of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are of size 1×1 or 2×2.

=== Takagi&#x27;s factorization ===
*Applicable to: square, complex, symmetric matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Decomposition: formula_39, where &quot;D&quot; is a real nonnegative diagonal matrix, and &quot;V&quot; is unitary. formula_50 denotes the matrix transpose of &quot;V&quot;.
*Comment: The diagonal elements of &quot;D&quot; are the nonnegative square roots of the eigenvalues of formula_60.
*Comment: &quot;V&quot; may be complex even if &quot;A&quot; is real.
*Comment: This is not a special case of the eigendecomposition (see above), which uses formula_61 instead of formula_50. Moreover, if &quot;A&quot; is not real, it is not Hermitian and the form using formula_63 also does not apply.

=== Singular value decomposition ===

*Applicable to: &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Decomposition: formula_64, where &quot;D&quot; is a nonnegative diagonal matrix, and &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; satisfy formula_65. Here formula_63 is the conjugate transpose of &quot;V&quot; (or simply the transpose, if &quot;V&quot; contains real numbers only), and &quot;I&quot; denotes the identity matrix (of some dimension). 
*Comment: The diagonal elements of &quot;D&quot; are called the singular values of &quot;A&quot;.
*Comment: Like the eigendecomposition above, the singular value decomposition involves finding basis directions along which matrix multiplication is equivalent to scalar multiplication, but it has greater generality since the matrix under consideration need not be square.
*Uniqueness: the singular values of formula_11 are always uniquely determined. formula_13 and formula_34 need not to be unique in general.

=== Scale-invariant decompositions ===

Refers to variants of existing matrix decompositions, such as the SVD, that are invariant with respect to diagonal scaling.

*Applicable to: &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Unit-Scale-Invariant Singular-Value Decomposition: formula_70, where &quot;S&quot; is a unique nonnegative diagonal matrix of scale-invariant singular values, &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are unitary matrices, formula_63 is the conjugate transpose of &quot;V&quot;, and positive diagonal matrices &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;.
*Comment: Is analogous to the SVD except that the diagonal elements of &quot;S&quot; are invariant with respect to left and/or right multiplication of &quot;A&quot; by arbitrary nonsingular diagonal matrices, as opposed to the standard SVD for which the singular values are invariant with respect to left and/or right multiplication of &quot;A&quot; by arbitrary unitary matrices.
*Comment: Is an alternative to the standard SVD when invariance is required with respect to diagonal rather than unitary transformations of &quot;A&quot;.
*Uniqueness: The scale-invariant singular values of formula_11 (given by the diagonal elements of &quot;S&quot;) are always uniquely determined. Diagonal matrices &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, and unitary &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, are not necessarily unique in general.
*Comment: &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; matrices are not the same as those from the SVD.

Analogous scale-invariant decompositions can be derived from other matrix decompositions; for example, to obtain scale-invariant eigenvalues.

===Hessenberg decomposition===
*Applicable to: square matrix A.
*Decomposition: formula_73 where formula_74 is the Hessenberg matrix and formula_75 is a unitary matrix.
*Comment: often the first step in the Schur decomposition.

===Complete orthogonal decomposition===

*Also known as: &quot;UTV decomposition&quot;, &quot;ULV decomposition&quot;, &quot;URV decomposition&quot;.
*Applicable to: &quot;m&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Decomposition: formula_76, where &quot;T&quot; is a triangular matrix, and &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are unitary matrices.
*Comment: Similar to the singular value decomposition and to the Schur decomposition.

== Other decompositions ==

=== Polar decomposition ===

*Applicable to: any square complex matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Decomposition: formula_77 (right polar decomposition) or formula_78 (left polar decomposition), where &quot;U&quot; is a unitary matrix and &quot;P&quot; and &quot;P&quot;&#x27; are positive semidefinite Hermitian matrices.
*Uniqueness: formula_75 is always unique and equal to formula_80 (which is always hermitian and positive semidefinite). If formula_11 is invertible, then formula_13 is unique.
*Comment: Since any Hermitian matrix admits a spectral decomposition with a unitary matrix, formula_75 can be written as formula_84. Since formula_75 is positive semidefinite, all elements in formula_86 are non-negative. Since the product of two unitary matrices is unitary, taking formula_87one can write formula_88 which is the singular value decomposition. Hence, the existence of the polar decomposition is equivalent to the existence of the singular value decomposition.

=== Algebraic polar decomposition ===
*Applicable to: square, complex, non-singular matrix &quot;A&quot;.
*Decomposition: formula_89, where &quot;Q&quot; is a complex orthogonal matrix and &quot;S&quot; is complex symmetric matrix.
*Uniqueness: If formula_90 has no negative real eigenvalues, then the decomposition is unique.
*Comment: The existence of this decomposition is equivalent to formula_91 being similar to formula_90.
*Comment: A variant of this decomposition is formula_93, where &quot;R&quot; is a real matrix and &quot;C&quot; is a circular matrix.

=== Mostow&#x27;s decomposition ===
* Applicable to: square, complex, non-singular matrix &quot;A&quot;.
* Decomposition: formula_94, where &quot;U&quot; is unitary, &quot;M&quot; is real anti-symmetric and &quot;S&quot; is real symmetric.
* Comment: The matrix &quot;A&quot; can also be decomposed as formula_95, where &quot;U&quot;2 is unitary, &quot;M&quot;2 is real anti-symmetric and &quot;S&quot;2 is real symmetric.

=== Sinkhorn normal form ===

*Applicable to: square real matrix &quot;A&quot; with strictly positive elements.
*Decomposition: formula_96, where &quot;S&quot; is doubly stochastic and &quot;D&quot;1 and &quot;D&quot;2 are real diagonal matrices with strictly positive elements.

=== Sectoral decomposition ===
*Applicable to: square, complex matrix &quot;A&quot; with numerical range contained in the sector formula_97.
*Decomposition: formula_98, where &quot;C&quot; is an invertible complex matrix and formula_99 with all formula_100.

=== Williamson&#x27;s normal form ===
* Applicable to: square, positive-definite real matrix &quot;A&quot; with order 2&quot;n&quot;×2&quot;n&quot;.
* Decomposition: formula_101, where formula_102 is a symplectic matrix and &quot;D&quot; is a nonnegative &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; diagonal matrix.

===Matrix square root===

* Decomposition: formula_103, not unique in general.
* In the case of positive semidefinite formula_11, there is a unique positive semidefinite formula_105 such that formula_106.

== Generalizations ==

There exist analogues of the SVD, QR, LU and Cholesky factorizations for quasimatrices and cmatrices or continuous matrices. A ‘quasimatrix’ is, like a matrix, a rectangular scheme whose elements are indexed, but one discrete index is replaced by a continuous index. Likewise, a ‘cmatrix’, is continuous in both indices. As an example of a cmatrix, one can think of the kernel of an integral operator.

These factorizations are based on early work by , and . For an account, and a translation to English of the seminal papers, see .

<text>Cleaning is the process of removing unwanted substances, such as dirt, infectious agents, and other impurities, from an object or environment. Cleaning is often performed for aesthetic, hygienic, functional, safety, or environmental protection purposes. Cleaning occurs in many different contexts, and uses many different methods. Several occupations are devoted to cleaning.

==Contexts==
Cleaning occurs in various commercial, domestic, personal, and environmental contexts, which differ in scale and requirements.

* Commercial cleaning, in business or other commercial settings
** Terminal cleaning, in healthcare settings
* Housekeeping, including spring cleaning
* Hygiene, including personal grooming
* Environmental remediation, the removal of pollution or contaminants from the natural environment

==Methods==

Cleaning is broadly achieved through mechanical action and/or chemical processes (usually solvation); many methods rely on a combination of mechanical and chemical action. Methods include:

* Washing, usually done with water and often some kind of soap or detergent
** Mopping, usually using a mop
** Wiping, usually using a dry or moist piece of cloth (such as toilet paper, paper towel and wet wipe)
** Pressure washing, using a high-pressure stream of water
** Wet cleaning, methods of professional laundering that avoid the use of chemical solvents
* Abrasive blasting, typically used to remove bulk material from a surface, may be used to remove contaminants as well
* Acoustic cleaning, the use of sound waves to shake particulates loose from surfaces
** Ultrasonic cleaning, using ultrasound, usually from 20 to 400 kHz
** Megasonic cleaning, a gentler mechanism than ultrasonic cleaning, used in wafer, medical implant, and industrial part cleaning
* Carbon dioxide cleaning, a family of methods for parts cleaning and sterilization using carbon dioxide in its various phases
* Dry cleaning of clothing and textiles, using a chemical solvent other than water
* Flame cleaning of structural steel, with an oxyacetylene flame
* Green cleaning, using environmentally friendly methods and products
* Plasma cleaning, using energetic plasma or dielectric barrier discharge plasma created from various gases
* Sputter cleaning, performed in a vacuum by using physical sputtering of the surface
* Steam cleaning, in both domestic and industrial contexts
* Sweeping, mechanical removal usually using a brush
* Thermal cleaning, in industrial settings, involving pyrolysis and oxidation
* Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, which destroys microorganisms; used extensively in the medical and food industries
* Vacuum cleaning, using a vacuum cleaner

<text>The St Nazaire Raid or Operation Chariot was a British amphibious attack on the heavily defended Normandie dry dock at St Nazaire in German-occupied France during the Second World War. The operation was undertaken by the Royal Navy (RN) and British Commandos under the auspices of Combined Operations Headquarters on 28 March 1942. 

St Nazaire was targeted because the loss of its dry dock would force any large German warship in need of repairs, such as , sister ship of , to return to home waters by running the gauntlet of the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy and other British forces, via the English Channel or the North Sea.

The obsolete destroyer , accompanied by 18 smaller craft, crossed the English Channel to the Atlantic coast of France and rammed into the Normandie dry dock south gate. The ship had been packed with delayed-action explosives, well hidden within a steel and concrete case, that detonated later that day, putting the dock out of service until 1948.

A force of commandos landed to destroy machinery and other structures. German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilized virtually all the small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England. The commandos fought their way through the town to escape overland but many surrendered when they ran out of ammunition or were surrounded by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.

Of the 612 men who undertook the raid, 228 returned to Britain, 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war. German casualties included over 360 dead, some of whom were killed after the raid when &quot;Campbeltown&quot; exploded. To recognise their bravery, 89 members of the raiding party were awarded decorations, including five Victoria Crosses. After the war, St Nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the commandos. The operation has been called &quot;the greatest raid of all&quot; in British military circles.

==Background==
St Nazaire is on the north bank of the Loire, from the nearest British port. In 1942, it had a population of 50,000. The St Nazaire port has an outer harbour known as the Avant Port, formed by two piers jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean. This leads to two lock gates before the Bassin de St Nazaire. These gates control the water level in the basin so that it is not affected by the tide.

Beyond the basin is the larger inner dock called the Bassin de Penhoët, which can accommodate ships up to 10,000 tons. There is also an old entrance to the Bassin de St Nazaire midway along the Bassin de St Nazaire. Immediately upstream of this lies the Normandie dry dock, between the Bassin de St Nazaire and the Loire, with its southern end giving on to the Loire and the northern end facing into the Bassin de Penhoët. Built to house the ocean liner , this dock was the largest dry dock in the world when it was completed in 1932. The &quot;Old Mole&quot; jetty juts into the Loire halfway between the southern pier of the Avant Port and the old entrance into the basin.

On 24 May 1941, the Battle of the Denmark Strait was fought between the German ships and and the British ships and . &quot;Hood&quot; exploded and sank; the damaged &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was forced to retire. &quot;Bismarck&quot;, also damaged, ordered her consort to proceed independently while she headed for the French port of St Nazaire, which was the only port on the Atlantic coast with a dry dock able to accommodate a ship of her size. She was intercepted by the British and sunk en route.

Britain&#x27;s Naval Intelligence Division first proposed a commando raid on the dock in late 1941. When the was declared operational in January 1942, the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Air Force (RAF) were already drawing up plans to attack her. Planners from Combined Operations Headquarters were looking at potential scenarios if &quot;Tirpitz&quot; escaped the naval blockade and reached the Atlantic. They decided the only port able to accommodate her was St Nazaire, especially if, like &quot;Bismarck&quot;, she was damaged en route and needed repairs. They came to the conclusion that if the dock at St Nazaire were unavailable, the Germans were unlikely to risk sending &quot;Tirpitz&quot; into the Atlantic.

Combined Operations examined several options while planning the destruction of the dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties. This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life.

The Special Operations Executive (SOE) were approached to see if its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.

The planners then examined whether a commando force could accomplish the task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. In one early plan, the planners designed a raid to approach the docks with only motor launches. John Hughes-Hallett and his colleagues immediately rejected this plan. Their opposition to the plan was strong. They argued, &quot;they&#x27;ll never reach the shore...&quot; They concluded, &quot;no destroyer, no operation.&quot; The approach was also too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.

===Plan===

The purpose of the raid was to destroy the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire with the water pumping machinery and other installations and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer to carry out the raid. It would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates. Commandos on board would then disembark and use demolition charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer would then be blown up. At the same time the RAF would undertake diversionary air raids in the area.

When the plan was presented to the Admiralty they refused to support it. The certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock was out of the question. They suggested they could provide an old Free French destroyer, , and a flotilla of small motor launches to transport the commandos and evacuate them afterwards. Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, was given on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and increase the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources and the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command dwindled during the planning of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were visually identified.

Combined Operations Headquarters worked closely with several intelligence organisations to plan the raid. The Naval Intelligence Division compiled information from a variety of sources. A detailed plan of the town of St Nazaire was provided by the Secret Intelligence Service, and information on the coastal artillery nearby was provided by the War Office&#x27;s Military Intelligence branch. Intelligence about the dock itself came from pre-war technical journals. The Naval Operational Intelligence Centre selected the route and timing for the raid based on intelligence about the location of minefields and German recognition signals gleaned from Enigma decryptions and knowledge of Luftwaffe patrols compiled by the Air Ministry&#x27;s Air Intelligence Branch. When all the plans had been pulled together and the timing worked out, the main part of the raid was expected to last no longer than two hours. The commandos and crew from &quot;Campbeltown&quot; were to board the motor launches at the Old Mole jetty and then make their escape.

===Composition of the raiding force===
The revised Combined Operations plan required one destroyer to ram the dock gates and a number of smaller craft to transport the commandos. The Royal Navy would therefore provide the largest contingent for the raid, under the overall command of the senior naval officer, Commander Robert Ryder. The ship selected to ram into the dock gates was , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Stephen Halden Beattie. &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was a First World War destroyer and had previously been in the United States Navy. She had come into RN service in 1940 as one of 50 destroyers transferred to the United Kingdom under the destroyers-for-bases deal.

Converting &quot;Campbeltown&quot; for the raid took ten days. She had to be lightened to raise her draught to get over the sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick-firing 12-pounder gun. Eight 20 mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the commandos on the open deck.

Two of her four funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut at an angle to resemble those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. The explosives were the Mark VII depth charge. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship&#x27;s seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.
Other naval units involved were two s, and , which would accompany the force to and from the French coast and remain out at sea during the raid. A motor gun boat (the Fairmile C type &quot;MGB 314&quot;) was the headquarters ship for the raid, with Commander Ryder and the commanding officer of the commandos on board, Lieutenant-Colonel A. C. Newman. A motor torpedo boat (a 70 ft Vosper, &quot;MTB 74&quot;), commanded by Sub-Lieutenant Michael Wynn, had two objectives: If the outer Normandie dock gates were open, she had to torpedo the inner dock gates. If the gates were closed she would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance into the St Nazaire basin.

Wynn&#x27;s boat was offered for the raid at the last moment. The MTB consumed a lot of petrol and was capable of only two speeds: a slow 6 knots and a fast 33 knots. The flaw meant the MTB could only progress by leap frogging and waiting. It was clear she would need a tow if taken in that condition. The flawed boat brought disapproval, necessitating last-minute modifications.

To assist in transporting the commandos, 12 Fairmile B Motor Launches (ML) were assigned from the 20th and 28th Motor Launch flotillas. These boats were re-armed with two Oerlikon 20 mm guns mounted forward and aft to complement their twin 0.303-in Lewis guns. At the last minute another four MLs were assigned from the 7th Motor Launch flotilla (see Footnotes for flotilla details). These four boats were also armed with two torpedoes each. Instead of transporting the commandos, these boats were to engage any German shipping found in the estuary. All the MLs had a auxiliary fuel tank fixed to the upper deck to increase their range. The S-class submarine would leave before the rest of the convoy and be in position to act as a navigational beacon to guide the convoy into the Loire estuary.

The man selected to lead the Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman; his No. 2 Commando would provide the largest commandos contingent, 173 men, for the raid. The Special Service Brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 Commandos.

The commandos were divided into three groups: One and Two would travel in the 12 MLs, while Three would be in &quot;Campbeltown&quot;. Half the commandos would be in the motor launches, alongside the explosive destroyer. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One traveling in ML 447, 457, 307, 443, 306 and 446 had the objectives of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then to move into the old town and blow up the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.

Group Two, under the command of Captain Burn, in ML 192, 262, 267, 268, 156 and 177 would land at the old entrance to the St Nazaire basin. Its objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, to blow up the locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counterattack from the submarine base. Group Three was under the command of Major William &#x27;Bill&#x27; Copland, who was also the commandos&#x27; second in command. It was to secure the immediate area around &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, destroy the dock&#x27;s water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. All three groups were subdivided into assault, demolition, and protection teams. The assault teams would clear the way for the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.

The commandos were aided in their planning for the operation by Captain Bill Pritchard of the Royal Engineers, who had pre-war experience as an apprentice in the Great Western Railway dockyards and whose father was the dock master of Cardiff Docks. In 1940 while part of the British Expeditionary Force in France, his duties had included determining how to disable the French dockyards if they were captured. One of the dockyards he had studied was St Nazaire, and he had submitted a report detailing how to put the dock out of action.

===German forces===
The Germans had around 5,000 troops in the immediate area of St Nazaire. The port was defended by the 280th Naval Artillery Battalion under the command of Edo Dieckmann. The battalion was composed of 28 guns of various calibres from 75 mm to 280 mm railway guns, all positioned to guard the coastal approaches. The heavy guns were supplemented by the guns and searchlights of the 22nd Naval Flak Brigade under the command of Karl-Konrad Mecke.

The brigade was equipped with 43 anti-aircraft guns ranging in calibre from 20 to 40 mm. These guns had a dual role as both anti-aircraft and coastal defence weapons. Many were in concrete emplacements on top of the submarine pens and other dockside installations of the St Nazaire submarine base.

The harbour defence companies were responsible for local defence and for the security of the ships and submarines moored in the harbour. These companies and the harbour defence boats used to patrol the river were under the command of Harbour Commander Kellerman. The 333rd Infantry Division was the German Army unit responsible for the defence of the coast between St Nazaire and Lorient. The division had no troops based in the town, but some were garrisoned in villages nearby and would be able to respond to any attack on the port.

The (German navy) had at least three surface ships in the Loire estuary: a destroyer, an armed trawler and a (&#x27;minesweeper&#x27;), the last being the guard ship for the port. On the night of the raid there were also four harbour defence boats and ten ships from the 16th and 42nd Minesweeper flotillas berthed in the basin, while two tankers were berthed inside the &quot;Normandie&quot; dock. 

The 6th and 7th U-boat flotillas, commanded by Georg-Wilhelm Schulz and Herbert Sohler respectively, were permanently based in the port. It is not known how many submarines were present on the day of the raid. The submarine base had been inspected by the U-boat Commander in Chief, Karl Dönitz, the day before the raid. He asked what they would do if the base were subjected to an attack by British Commandos. Sohler replied that &quot;an attack on the base would be hazardous and highly improbable.&quot;

==The raid==
===Outward journey===
The three destroyers and 16 small boats left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into a convoy of three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the portside MLs were to head for the Old Mole to disembark their commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by &quot;Campbeltown&quot; and &quot;Atherstone&quot;.

The convoy next encountered two French fishing trawlers. Both crews were taken off and the ships sunk for fear they might report the composition and location of the convoy. At 17:00 the convoy received a signal from Commander-in-Chief Plymouth that five German torpedo boats were in the area. Two hours later another signal informed them that another two Hunt-class destroyers, and , had been dispatched at full speed to join the convoy&#x27;s return.

The convoy reached a position off St Nazaire at 21:00 and changed course toward the estuary, leaving &quot;Atherstone&quot; and &quot;Tynedale&quot; as a sea patrol. The convoy adopted a new formation with the MGB and two torpedo MLs in the lead, followed by &quot;Campbeltown&quot;. The rest of the MLs formed two columns on either side and astern of the destroyer, with the MTB bringing up the rear. The first casualty of the raid was &quot;ML 341&quot;, which had developed engine trouble and was abandoned. At 22:00 the submarine &quot;Sturgeon&quot; directed her navigation beacon out to sea to guide the convoy in. At about the same time &quot;Campbeltown&quot; raised the German naval ensign in an attempt to deceive any German lookouts into thinking she was a German destroyer.

At 23:30 on 27 March, five RAF squadrons (comprising 35 Whitleys and 27 Wellingtons) started their bombing runs. The bombers had to stay above and were supposed to remain over the port for 60 minutes to divert attention toward themselves and away from the sea. They had orders to only bomb clearly identified military targets and to drop only one bomb at a time. As it turned out, poor weather with full cloud cover over the port meant that only four aircraft bombed targets in St Nazaire. Six aircraft managed to bomb other nearby targets.

At around 02:00, the convoy was sighted by the , which dived and later reported the British ships as moving westward, further complicating the German understanding of the raid.

The unusual behaviour dropping bombs one by one from the bombers concerned Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, he issued a warning that there might be a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships&#x27; crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this an estuary lookout boat reported seeing some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.

===Ramming the dry dock===
At 00:30 hours on 28 March the convoy crossed over the shoals at the mouth of the Loire estuary, with &quot;Campbeltown&quot; scraping the bottom twice. Each time she pulled free, and the group proceeded toward the harbour in darkness. They had come within about eight minutes&#x27; passage from the dock gates when, at 01:22, the entire convoy was illuminated by searchlights on both banks of the estuary. A naval signal light demanded their identification.

&quot;MGB 314&quot; replied in a coded response obtained from a German trawler boarded during the Vågsøy raid in 1941. A few bursts were fired from a shore battery and both &quot;Campbeltown&quot; and &quot;MGB 314&quot; replied: &quot;Ship being fired upon by friendly forces&quot;. The deception gave them a little more time before every German gun in the bay opened fire. At 01:28, with the convoy from the dock gates, Beattie ordered the German flag lowered and the White Ensign raised. The intensity of the German fire seemed to increase. The guard ship opened fire and was quickly silenced when the ships in the convoy responded, shooting into her as they passed.

By now all the ships in the convoy were within range to engage targets ashore and were firing at the gun emplacements and searchlights. &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was hit several times and increased her speed to . The helmsman on her bridge was killed, and his replacement was wounded and replaced as well. Blinded by the searchlights, Beattie knew they were close to their objective. Still under heavy fire, the MGB turned into the estuary as &quot;Campbeltown&quot; cleared the end of the Old Mole, cut through anti-torpedo netting strung across the entrance and rammed the dock gates, striking home at 01:34, three minutes later than scheduled. The force of the impact drove the ship onto the gates, crushing of the bow forward of the demolition charge cemented belowdecks.

===Disembarkation from &quot;Campbeltown&quot; and the MLs===

The commandos on &quot;Campbeltown&quot; now disembarked. These comprised two assault teams, five demolition teams with their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations associated with the dry dock caisson gates.

Captain Donald William Roy – &#x27;The Laird&#x27; – and his 14-man kilted assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the quayside and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Captain Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.

They lost four men in this action. The fifth team also succeeded in completing all their objectives, but almost half their men were killed. The other two commando groups were not as successful. The MLs transporting Groups One and Two had almost all been destroyed on their approach. &quot;ML 457&quot; was the only boat to land its commandos on the Old Mole and only &quot;ML 177&quot; had managed to reach the gates at the old entrance to the basin. That team succeeded in planting charges on two tugboats moored in the basin.

There were only two other MLs in the vicinity: &quot;ML 160&quot; had continued past the dock and was engaging targets upriver, &quot;ML 269&quot; appeared to be out of control and was running in circles.

Lt Col Newman aboard the MGB need not have landed, but he was one of the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun position on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.

Some 100 commandos were still ashore when Newman realised that evacuation by sea was no longer possible. He gathered the survivors and issued three orders:
* To do our best to get back to England;
* Not to surrender until all our ammunition is exhausted;
* Not to surrender at all if we can help it.
Newman and Copland led the charge from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and advanced into the new town. The commandos attempted to get through the narrow streets of the town and into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended, they surrendered. Not all the commandos were captured, as five men reached neutral Spain and eventually returned to England.

===Small ships===
Most of the unarmoured wooden MLs had been destroyed on the run in and were burning. The first ML in the starboard column was the first boat to catch fire. Her captain managed to beach her at the end of the Old Mole. Some starboard boats managed to reach their objective and disembark their commandos. &quot;ML 457&quot;, the leading boat in the port column, got to within of the mole in the face of heavy direct fire and hand grenades before being set on fire. 

The crew were rescued by &quot;ML 160&quot;, one of the torpedo MLs which had been looking for targets of opportunity such as the two large tankers reported to be in the harbour. The commanders of &quot;ML 160&quot; and &quot;ML 447&quot;, Lieutenants T Boyd and T D L Platt, were awarded the Distinguished Service Order for their bravery. The rest of the port column had been destroyed or disabled before reaching the mole. &quot;ML 192&quot; and &quot;ML 262&quot; were set on fire, and all but six of their men were killed. &quot;ML 268&quot; was blown up, with one survivor.

Thomas O&#x27;Leary, the wireless operator for &quot;ML 446&quot;, said:One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew the back of his head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn&#x27;t get in (to the objective) and all of a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire. &quot;ML 177&quot;, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. &quot;ML 269&quot;, another torpedo-armed boat, moved up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing &quot;Campbeltown&quot; it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. The boat turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set the boat&#x27;s engine on fire.

&quot;ML 306&quot; also came under heavy fire when it arrived near the port. Sergeant Thomas Durrant of No. 1 Commando, manning the aft Lewis gun, engaged gun and searchlight positions on the run in. He was wounded but stayed with his gun. The ML reached the open sea but was attacked at short range by the . Durrant returned fire, aiming for the torpedo boat&#x27;s bridge. He was wounded again but remained at his gun even after the German commander asked for their surrender. He fired many drums of ammunition until the ML was boarded. Durrant died of his wounds and, on the recommendation of &quot;Jaguar&quot;″s commander, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

After the commando headquarters group had landed, Commander Ryder went to check for himself that &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was firmly stuck in the dock. Some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the MGB. Ryder returned to the boat and ordered the MTB to carry out its alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin. After a successful torpedo attack, Ryder ordered the MTB to leave. On their way out of the estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ML and were hit and set on fire. Back at the docks the MGB had positioned itself in mid-river to engage enemy gun emplacements. The forward 2 pounder was manned by Able Seaman William Alfred Savage. Commander Ryder reported that The rate of supporting fire had evidently been felt, and the commandos in the area of the Tirpitz dock had undoubtedly overcome the resistance in that area. There was an appreciable slackening in the enemy&#x27;s fire.
Ryder could see no ships other than seven or eight burning MLs. He then realised that the landing places at the Old Mole and the entrance to the basin had both been recaptured by the Germans. There was nothing more they could do for the commandos, so they headed out to sea. On their way they were continuously illuminated by German searchlights and were hit at least six times by the German guns. Passing &quot;ML 270&quot;, they ordered her to follow and made smoke to hide both boats.

When they reached the open sea the smaller calibre guns were out of range and stopped firing but the heavier artillery continued to engage them. The boats were about off-shore when the last German salvo straddled them and killed Savage, who was still at his gun. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his exploits. His citation recognised both Savage and the bravery of &quot;many others, unnamed, in Motor Launches, Motor Gun Boats and Motor Torpedo Boats who gallantly carried out their duties in entirely exposed positions against Enemy fire at very close range.&quot;

===Return journey===

At 06:30 the five German torpedo boats that the convoy had evaded the previous day were sighted by HMS &quot;Atherstone&quot; and &quot;Tynedale&quot;. The destroyers turned toward them and opened fire at a range of . After ten minutes the German boats turned away, making smoke. The destroyers sighted the MGB and two accompanying MLs soon after and transferred their casualties to &quot;Atherstone&quot;. Not expecting any more boats to arrive, they headed for home. Just after 09:00 the Hunt-class escort destroyers &quot;Brocklesby&quot; and &quot;Cleveland&quot; arrived, sent by Commander-in-Chief Plymouth. Shortly after this the ships were spotted by a Heinkel 115 floatplane of the .

The next German aircraft on the scene, a Junkers Ju 88, was engaged by a RAF Bristol Beaufighter which had arrived in the area earlier. Both aircraft crashed into the sea. Other German planes arrived but were driven off by Beaufighters and Hudsons from Coastal Command. The Atlantic weather conditions deteriorated. Amid concerns about the growing German threat and the realisation that the damaged small ships would not be able to keep up, Commander Sayer ordered the crews off the smaller boats and had them sunk.

&quot;ML 160&quot;, &quot;ML 307&quot; and &quot;ML 443&quot; reached the rendezvous and waited until 10:00 for the destroyers to appear. Having already been attacked once, they moved further out into the Atlantic to try to avoid the but a Junkers Ju 88 appeared overhead at 07:30 and approached them at low level for a closer look. The ships opened fire, hit the Junkers in the cockpit and the aircraft crashed into the sea. The next aircraft to appear was a Blohm &amp; Voss seaplane which attempted to bomb the ships but left after being damaged by machine-gun fire. The MLs eventually reached England unaided the following day.

===&quot;Campbeltown&quot; explodes===
The explosive charges in HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; detonated at noon on 28 March 1942, and the dry dock was destroyed. Reports vary on the fate of the two tankers that were in the dock; they were either swept away by the wall of water and sunk, or swept to the far end of the dock, but not sunk.
A party of 40 senior German officers and civilians who were on a tour of &quot;Campbeltown&quot; were killed. In total, the explosion killed about 360 men. The wreck of &quot;Campbeltown&quot; could still be seen inside the dry dock months later when RAF photo reconnaissance planes were sent to photograph the port.

According to Captain Robert Montgomery (Royal Engineers, attached to No. 2 Commando), &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was meant to have detonated at 04:30, the delay caused, he believes, by some of the acid in the pencil detonators being distilled away. As the morning progressed, more and more captured comrades joined him in the German HQ.

The day after the explosion, workers were assigned to clean up the debris and wreckage. On 30 March at 16:30 the torpedoes from &quot;MTB 74&quot;, which were on a delayed fuse setting, exploded at the old entrance into the basin. This raised alarms among the Germans. The workers ran away from the dock area. German guards, mistaking their khaki uniforms for British uniforms, opened fire, killing some of them. The Germans also thought that some commandos were still hiding in the town, and made a street by street search, during which some townspeople were also killed.

==Aftermath==

The explosion put the dry dock out of commission for the remainder of the war. The St Nazaire raid had been a success, but at high cost: of the 612 men of the Royal Navy and commandos who took part in the raid, only 228 men returned to England.

Five commandos escaped via neutral Spain and Gibraltar with the help of French citizens and took a ship to England; 169 men were killed (105 RN and 64 commandos) and another 215 became prisoners of war (106 RN and 109 commandos). They were first taken to La Baule and then sent to Stalag 133 at Rennes. The fallen British raiders were buried at the La Baule-Escoublac cemetery, west of St Nazaire.

To recognise their achievement, 89 decorations were awarded for the raid, including Victoria Crosses awarded to Lieutenant Commander Beattie, Lieutenant Colonel Newman and Commander Ryder and posthumously to Sergeant Durrant and Able Seaman Savage. Distinguished Service Orders were awarded to Major William Copland, Captain Donald Roy, Lieutenant T. Boyd and Lieutenant T. D. L. Platt. Other decorations awarded were four Conspicuous Gallantry Medals, five Distinguished Conduct Medals, 17 Distinguished Service Crosses, 11 Military Crosses, 24 Distinguished Service Medals and 15 Military Medals. Four men were awarded the Croix de guerre by France and another 51 were mentioned in dispatches.

Adolf Hitler was furious that the British had been able to sail a flotilla of ships up the Loire unhindered and he sacked Carl Hilpert, chief of staff to the OB West (Commander in Chief West). The raid refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of the raid. By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. 

Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain. The battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; never entered the Atlantic. She remained in Norwegian fjords to threaten Allied shipping until she was destroyed by the RAF in Operation Catechism on 12 November 1944.

==Legacy==

St Nazaire was one of the 38 battle honours presented to the commandos after the war. The survivors formed their own association, the St Nazaire Society, which is a registered charity in the United Kingdom.

A memorial to the raid erected in Falmouth bears the following inscription:
A new , a Type 22 frigate, was launched on 7 October 1987. She carried the ship&#x27;s bell from the first &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, which had been rescued during the raid and been presented to the town of Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, US at the end of the Second World War. In 1988 the people of Campbelltown voted to lend the bell to the new ship for as long as she remained in Royal Navy service.
The bell was returned to the town on 21 June 2011 when HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was decommissioned.

On 4 September 2002, a tree and seat at the National Memorial Arboretum were dedicated to the men of the raid. The seat bears the inscription:In memory of the Royal Navy Sailors and Army Commandos killed in the raid on St Nazaire on 28 March 1942 

A new Type 31 HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot; has been announced as part of the new &quot;Inspiration class&quot; of frigates for the Royal Navy, announced on 19 May 2021.

In 2007, Jeremy Clarkson presented a BBC documentary on the raid entitled &quot;Jeremy Clarkson: The Greatest Raid of All Time&quot;, featuring interviews with surviving commandos.

<text>Andrew Nicholas Oliver and Philip Edward Oliver, together known as the Oliver Twins, are British twin brothers and video game designers.

They developed computer games while they were still at school, contributing their first type-in game to a magazine in 1983. They worked with publishers Codemasters for a number of years following their first collaboration &quot;Super Robin Hood&quot;, creating the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series of games and many of Codemasters&#x27; Simulator Series games. 
In 1990 they founded Interactive Studios which later became Blitz Games Studios. In October 2013 they founded Radiant Worlds, based in Leamington Spa, with long time friend and colleague Richard Smithies.

== History ==
Philip and Andrew Oliver first began programming computer games while at school (Clarendon School in Trowbridge). They discovered their interest in computing when their brother bought a used ZX 81 when they were 13. They bought a faster Dragon 32 in September 1982, with a bigger memory. They tried to improve the type-in games they found in magazines and eventually created their own game, &quot;Road Runner&quot;, which was published as written code in &quot;Computer and Video Games Magazine&quot; in January 1984. The same year they won first prize in a national TV competition (&quot;The Saturday Show&quot;) to design a computer game. 

===Codemasters===
Their first game for Codemasters, &quot;Super Robin Hood&quot; for the Amstrad CPC, was published in 1986. The Codemasters publishing relationship led to the origin of the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series and the &quot;Simulator&quot; series.

===Interactive Studios (Blitz Games Studios)===
In 1990, at the age of 22, they started Interactive Studios, later called Blitz Games Studios. Apart from their own games, the Oliver Twins were also responsible for porting a number of other prominent games to the Sega platforms, including &quot;Theme Park&quot; and &quot;Syndicate&quot;.

After 23 years, Blitz Games folded in 2013, with the loss of 175 staff, and owing millions to creditors.

===Radiant Worlds===
In October 2013 they founded Radiant Worlds, based in Leamington Spa, UK, with long time friend and colleague Richard Smithies to develop &quot;&quot; for Korean-based Smilegate. SkySaga was an ambitious online voxel based game based on an original concept by members of the Blitz Games Studios team. In August 2017 Smilegate put SkySaga on hold and the Olivers and Smithies put the company up for sale. In January 2018, Rebellion, a UK games developer and publisher, purchased the company and renamed it to Rebellion (Warwick). The twins remained with Rebellion until February 2019, at which point they left to form a game consultancy business.

===&quot;Dizzy&quot; revival ===
In 2015 Philip Oliver found a hand drawn map titled &quot;Wonderland Dizzy&quot; while preparing for a talk the twins were due to give at that year&#x27;s &quot;Play Blackpool&quot; event, after looking around further a disk was found which contained the full uncompiled source code of a game with the same name which they had written 22 years earlier for the NES but had forgotten about. The twins came into contact with Lukasz Kur via a &quot;Dizzy&quot; fansite, who fixed a few bugs in the game&#x27;s code and translated it into a few languages before compiling it. The game was released online and free to play on 24 October 2015. In 2016, they released a second lost Dizzy game, &quot;Mystery World Dizzy&quot;, which was originally scheduled for release on the Nintendo in 1993. In May 2017 the twins announced they would be working on a new &quot;Dizzy&quot; game, their first for over 20 years. In a fun video for the ZX Spectrum Next Kickstarter campaign they revealed the game would be inspired by the classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by author L. Frank Baum, and would be called Wonderful Dizzy.

==Leadership==
Both of the Olivers take an active role in supporting the UK games industry. Philip Oliver is one of the founders of developers&#x27; trade body TIGA and has served as an active board member (currently a director) since its inception in 2001. He was also a director on the board for &quot;e-skills UK&quot; for several years.

The brothers received honorary doctorates in 2008 from Coventry University (in business administration (DBA) and technology (DTech) for Philip and Andrew respectively) in recognition of their contribution to the growth of the electronic games industry both regionally and internationally, and were honoured as Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts in 2010.

After Philip attended the launch of the UK Government&#x27;s Next Gen Report (also known as the &quot;Livingstone&quot;-Hope Report) in February 2011 about challenges faced by the UK Games industry, he established Made in Creative UK which with Andrew they run as a not for profit campaign to raise awareness of the world class game developers and digital creatives developers based in the UK. The campaign has over 350 supporting companies and many high-profile supporters, including Sajid Javid MP (Culture Secretary &amp; Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills).

The Oliver Twins&#x27; early games and story inspired many people to develop video games as a career, and this was captured in Chris Wilkins and Roger Kean&#x27;s book &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Dizzy: The Story of the Oliver Twins&quot;, published December 2016 through Fusion Retro Books.

A video shot at the launch of the book entitled &quot;Videogame Legends – Computerphile&quot; prompted Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson, the creator of &quot;Minecraft&quot;, to tweet that he was one of those inspired by the Oliver Twins games: &quot;I grew up loving and being inspired by their work.&quot;

In December 2017 Guinness World Records awarded the Oliver Twins the record for &quot;Most Prolific 8-bit videogame developers&quot;. They developed 26 different commercially released games for 8-bit computers and consoles from 1984-1992 and wrote a total of 49 games overall, taking into account titles released for multiple platforms.

<text>John MacDonald MacCormick (20 November 1904 – 13 October 1961) was a Scottish lawyer, Scottish nationalist politician and advocate of Home Rule in Scotland.

==Early life==
MacCormick was born in Pollokshields, Glasgow, in 1904. His father was Donald MacCormick, a sea captain who was from the Isle of Mull. His mother was the first district nurse in the Western Isles. MacCormick was educated at Woodside School, and studied law at the University of Glasgow (1923–1928). He became involved in politics while at university, and joined the Glasgow University Labour Club and the Independent Labour Party in 1923. In September 1927 MacCormick left the ILP and formed the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association (GUSNA), which was designed to promote Scottish culture and nationalism and self-government. The association was sufficiently neutral to act as the honest broker between the various nationalist organisations which would merge to form the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in April 1928. MacCormick was a talented speaker and organiser, and served as the national secretary of the NPS. MacCormick was often known by his nickname &quot;King John&quot;, which he said came from a heckle during a debate he was participating in when upon a question from the floor whether a devolved Scotland would retain the monarchy, or would be a republic, someone interjected and said: &quot;no, it will be a kingdom and John MacCormick will be our king.&quot;

The failure of the NPS to make an electoral breakthrough led him to question current tactics and he concluded that the party&#x27;s fundamentalist wing was frightening away potential support because of its support for republicanism and independence. In consequence, MacCormick initiated a campaign to redefine the policy of the NPS, to make it more moderate and to tone down demands for independence. He first stood for Parliament as an NPS candidate at the 1929 general election, when he came third in Glasgow Camlachie, with 1,646 votes. He also stood at Inverness at the 1931 general election.

==SNP==
In 1932, MacCormick began to make overtures to the right-wing Scottish Party, believing that, as the Scottish Party included a number of members of the Scottish &#x27;establishment&#x27;, their conversion to the cause of home rule would enhance the credibility of the nationalists. To secure an accommodation, MacCormick purged the NPS of radical elements, and moved the policy of the NPS towards that of the Scottish Party. His endeavours paid dividends, and in 1934 the two parties merged to form the Scottish National Party (SNP). MacCormick himself was not a dogmatic politician, and described himself as a radical, by which he meant a form of centrist liberal. His response to the failure of the SNP to make an electoral impact in the mid-1930s was to search for alternative strategies. He considered the basic problem to be that, although many people in Scotland favoured home rule, they were not, on the whole, willing to put the issue above conventional party loyalties. The solution, MacCormick argued, was to make the other parties take home rule seriously, and to demonstrate widespread support for the cause. In 1939 he launched the idea of a Scottish national convention, which would bring together all sections of Scottish society and all shades of Scottish political opinion in favour of home rule. He had made contact with both the Labour and Liberal parties, and although the first meeting, scheduled for September 1939, was cancelled because of the outbreak of World War II, MacCormick pushed negotiations throughout the war.

As a leading figure in the SNP, MacCormick came under increasing attack from the rank and file members for his failure to maintain party structure and organisation. He considered that his preferred strategy of co-operation with other organisations meant that there was little need for the SNP to function as a mainstream political party. He endeavoured to present an acceptable face of Scottish nationalism, and did much to reverse the party&#x27;s official anti-conscription policy following the outbreak of the Second World War. MacCormick stood as an SNP candidate for Inverness at the 1935 general election and at the 1937 Glasgow Hillhead by-election.

He resigned from the party in 1942 following his failure to persuade the party to adopt a devolutionist stance rather than supporting all out Scottish independence and due to the victory of Douglas Young over his favoured candidate, William Power, for the leadership of the SNP. Along with a number of dissatisfied delegates to that year&#x27;s SNP conference, he established the Scottish Convention to campaign for home rule for Scotland and later formed the Scottish Covenant Association.

==Scottish Convention, Scottish Covenant and later years==
MacCormick took the decision to join the Liberal Party as he viewed them as being the party most closely allied to his devolutionist ambitions for Scotland. He stood as the Liberal candidate for Inverness at the 1945 general election.

The Scottish Convention succeeded in 1947 in setting up an assembly along the lines planned in 1939. In 1951, MacCormick formed the Scottish Covenant Association, a non-partisan political organisation which campaigned to secure the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. This covenant was hugely successful in securing support from across the political spectrum, as well as in capturing the Scottish public&#x27;s imagination (over 2 million signed a petition demanding the convocation of an Assembly). In 1948, he stood as an independent candidate at the Paisley by-election, with what he erroneously believed to be Liberal and Conservative support, and lost. His failure discredited claims as to the popularity of home rule, and further served to reinforce notions that the Scottish Convention was an anti-Labour organisation. MacCormick&#x27;s failure left the SNP with a monopoly of the cause of home rule.

MacCormick was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in October 1950. He served as Rector until 1953. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the university in 1951. This association with GUSNA also saw the formation of a political friendship with a then young law student at Glasgow University, Ian Hamilton, who had run his campaign to be elected rector. MacCormick was involved, along with Hamilton, in the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1950 and its return to Arbroath Abbey. He also mounted a legal challenge, MacCormick v. Lord Advocate, over the right of Queen Elizabeth using the title &quot;Queen Elizabeth II&quot;, on grounds that there had been no previous Scottish Queen Elizabeth.

In 1955 MacCormick had a book detailing his activities in the home rule movement published, entitled &quot;The Flag in the Wind&quot;. His last attempt to enter parliament came at the 1959 General Election, when he stood for the Liberal Party at Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, again finishing second.

In the film &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot; MacCormick is played by Robert Carlyle.

==Personal life==
MacCormick married Margaret Isobel Miller in 1939, with whom he had two sons and two daughters. Their elder son, Iain (1939–2014), served as SNP Member of Parliament for Argyll from 1974 till 1979 (and was a founder member of the Social Democratic Party. Their second son, Neil (1941–2009) was regius professor of Public Law and Vice-Principal of the University of Edinburgh, and served as an SNP Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004. He was also the uncle of the journalist and broadcaster Donald MacCormick.

MacCormick died on 13 October 1961. His funeral was held in the chapel of the University of Glasgow.

<text>The Eurovision Young Dancers 2003 was the tenth edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers, held at the 
Stadsschouwburg Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands, between 29 June and 4 July 2003. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Nederlandse Programma Stichting (NPS), dancers from ten countries participated in the televised final. A total of seventeen countries took part in the competition therefore a semi-final was held a few days before at the same venue. and made their début while , and decided not to participate.

The semi-final took place on 2 July 2003. Each country could send one or two dancers, male or female, not older than 20. All countries except the host (Netherlands) had to take part in the semi-final.

The non-qualified countries were Armenia, , , , , and . Kristina Oom and Sebastian Michanek of Sweden won the contemporary dance prize, with Jerlin Ndudi of Ukraine winning the classical dance prize. Monika Hejduková and Viktor Konvalinka of Czech Republic won the &#x27;Youth Jury Choice&#x27; award.

==Location==
Stadsschouwburg Theatre in Amsterdam, Netherlands was the host venue for the 2003 edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers. The building is in the neo-Renaissance style dating back to 1894, and is the former home of the National Ballet and Opera.

==Format==
The format consists of dancers who are non-professional and between the ages of 16–21, competing in a performance of dance routines of their choice, which they have prepared in advance of the competition. All of the acts then take part in a choreographed group dance during &#x27;Young Dancers Week&#x27;.

Jury members of a professional aspect and representing the elements of ballet, contemporary, and modern dancing styles, score each of the competing individual and group dance routines. The overall winner upon completion of the final dances is chosen by the professional jury members. All participants received a medal, designed by Dutch artist .

There was no interval act this year, with footage of previous contest winners and an offstage interview with Agnès Letestu, winner of the contemporary dance prize in , broadcast instead.

== Results ==
===Preliminary round===
Broadcasters from seventeen countries took part in the preliminary round of the 2003 contest, of which ten qualified to the televised grand final. The following participants failed to qualify.

===Final===
There were two prizes given this year: one for contemporary dance (awarded to ) and one for classical ballet dance (awarded to ). A special &quot;young jury&quot; award was given as well by a group of young viewers that were in the audience, this went to contemporary runner-up .

====Classical category====
====Contemporary category====
== Jury members ==
The jury members consisted of the following:

* – Vladimir Vasiliev
* – Susanne Linke
* – Derrick Brown
* – Liz Imperio

<doc id="253892" wikidata="Q1113650" url="?curid=253892" title="Project Plowshare">
<text>Project Plowshare was the overall United States program for the development of techniques to use nuclear explosives for peaceful construction purposes. The program was organized in June 1957 as part of the worldwide Atoms for Peace efforts. As part of the program, 35 nuclear warheads were detonated in 27 separate tests. A similar program was carried out in the Soviet Union under the name Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy, although the Soviet program consisted of 124 tests.

Successful demonstrations of non-combat uses for nuclear explosives include rock blasting, stimulation of tight gas, chemical element manufacture, unlocking some of the mysteries of the R-process of stellar nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth&#x27;s deep crust, creating reflection seismology vibroseis data which has helped geologists and follow-on mining company prospecting.

The project&#x27;s uncharacteristically large and atmospherically vented Sedan nuclear test also led geologists to determine that Barringer crater was formed as a result of a meteor impact and not from a volcanic eruption, as had earlier been assumed. This became the first crater on Earth definitely proven to be from an impact event.

Negative impacts from Project Plowshare&#x27;s tests generated significant public opposition, which eventually led to the program&#x27;s termination in 1977. These consequences included tritiated water (projected to increase by CER Geonuclear Corporation to a level of 2% of the then-maximum level for drinking water) and the deposition of fallout from radioactive material being injected into the atmosphere before underground testing was mandated by treaty.

==Rationale==
By exploiting the peaceful uses of the &quot;friendly atom&quot; in medical applications, earth removal, and later in nuclear power plants, the nuclear industry and government sought to allay public fears about nuclear technology and promote the acceptance of nuclear weapons. At the peak of the Atomic Age, the United States Federal government initiated Project Plowshare, involving &quot;peaceful nuclear explosions&quot;. The United States Atomic Energy Commission chairman at the time, Lewis Strauss, announced that the Plowshares project was intended to &quot;highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests&quot;. These tests were to demonstrate that atomic bombs can be used for peaceful purposes, that the atomic sword could be beaten into a plowshare.

== Proposals ==
Proposed uses for nuclear explosives under Project Plowshare included widening the Panama Canal, constructing a new sea-level waterway through Nicaragua nicknamed the Pan-Atomic Canal, cutting paths through mountainous areas for highways, and connecting inland river systems. Other proposals involved blasting caverns for water, natural gas, and petroleum storage. Serious consideration was also given to using these explosives for various mining operations. One proposal suggested using nuclear blasts to connect underground aquifers in Arizona. Another plan involved surface blasting on the western slope of California&#x27;s Sacramento Valley for a water transport project.

One of the first serious cratering proposals that came close to being carried out was Project Chariot, which would have used several hydrogen bombs to create an artificial harbor at Cape Thompson, Alaska. It was never carried out due to concerns for the native populations and the fact that there was little potential use for the harbor to justify its risk and expense.

Project Carryall, proposed in 1963 by the Atomic Energy Commission, the California Division of Highways (now Caltrans), and the Santa Fe Railway, would have used 22 nuclear explosions to excavate a massive roadcut through the Bristol Mountains in the Mojave Desert, to accommodate construction of Interstate 40 and a new rail line.

A project proposed in a 1963 memorandum by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory would have used 520 2-megaton nuclear explosions to excavate a canal through the Negev Desert in Israel at an estimated cost of $575 million ($5 billion in 2021), to serve as an alternative route to the Suez Canal.

At the end of the program, a major objective was to develop nuclear explosives, and blast techniques, for stimulating the flow of natural gas in &quot;tight&quot; underground reservoir formations. In the 1960s, a proposal was suggested for a modified &quot;in situ&quot; shale oil extraction process which involved creation of a rubble chimney (a zone in the oil shale formation created by breaking the rock into fragments) using a nuclear explosive. However, this approach was abandoned for a number of technical reasons.

== Plowshare testing ==
The first Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE) blast was Project Gnome, conducted on December 10, 1961, in a salt bed southeast of Carlsbad, in southeast New Mexico. The explosion released 3.1 kilotons (13 TJ) of energy yield at a depth of which resulted in the formation of a diameter, high cavity. The test had many objectives, the most public of which involved the generation of steam which could then be used to generate electricity. Another objective was the production of useful radioisotopes and their recovery. Yet another experiment involved neutron time-of-flight physics, and a fourth experiment involved geophysical studies based upon the timed seismic source. Only the last objective was considered a complete success. The blast unintentionally vented radioactive steam while the press watched. The partly developed Project Coach detonation experiment that was to follow adjacent to the Gnome test was then canceled.

A number of proof-of-concept cratering blasts were conducted; including the Buggy shot of five 1-kiloton devices for a channel/trench in Area 30 and the largest being 104 kiloton (435 terajoule) on July 6, 1962, at the north end of Yucca Flats, within the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s Nevada Test Site (NTS) in southern Nevada. The shot, &quot;Sedan&quot;, displaced more than of soil and resulted in a radioactive cloud that rose to an altitude of . The radioactive dust plume headed northeast and then east towards the Mississippi River.

Over the next 11 years, 26 more nuclear explosion tests were conducted under the United States PNE program. The radioactive blast debris from 839 U.S. underground nuclear test explosions remain buried in-place and have been judged impractical to remove by the DOE&#x27;s Nevada Site Office. Funding quietly ended in 1997, and costs for the program have been estimated at more than (US) $770 million.

===Natural gas stimulation experiment===
Three nuclear explosion experiments were intended to stimulate the flow of natural gas from &quot;tight&quot; formation gas fields. Industrial participants included El Paso Natural Gas Company for the Gasbuggy test near Farmington, New Mexico; CER Geonuclear Corporation and Austral Oil Company for the Rulison test; and CER Geonuclear Corporation for the Rio Blanco test.

The final PNE blast took place on May 17, 1973, under Fawn Creek, north of Grand Junction, Colorado. Three 30-kiloton detonations took place simultaneously at depths of . If it had been successful, plans called for the use of hundreds of specialized nuclear explosives in the western Rockies gas fields. The previous two tests had indicated that the produced natural gas would be too radioactive for safe use; the Rio Blanco test found that the three blast cavities had not connected as hoped, and the resulting gas still contained unacceptable levels of radionuclides.

By 1974, approximately $82 million had been invested in the nuclear gas stimulation technology program. It was estimated that even after 25 years of production of all the natural gas deemed recoverable, only 15 to 40% of the investment would be recouped. Also, the concept that stove burners in California might soon emit trace amounts of blast radionuclides into family homes did not sit well with the general public. The contaminated gas was never channeled into commercial supply lines.

The situation remained so for the next three decades, but a resurgence in Colorado Western slope natural gas drilling has brought resource development closer and closer to the original underground detonations. By mid-2009, 84 drilling permits had been issued within a radius, with 11 permits within mile of the site.

==Impacts, opposition and economics==
Operation Plowshare &quot;started with great expectations and high hopes&quot;. Planners believed that the projects could be completed safely, but there was less confidence that they could be completed more economically than conventional methods. Moreover, there was insufficient public and Congressional support for the projects. Projects Chariot and Coach were two examples where technical problems and environmental concerns prompted further feasibility studies which took several years, and each project was eventually canceled.

Citizen groups voiced concerns and opposition to some of the Plowshare tests. There were concerns that the blast effects from the Schooner explosion could dry up active wells or trigger an earthquake. There was opposition to both Rulison and Rio Blanco tests because of possible radioactive gas flaring operations and other environmental hazards. In a 1973 article, &quot;Time&quot; used the term &quot;Project Dubious&quot; to describe Operation Plowshare.

There were negative impacts from several of Project Plowshare’s 27 nuclear explosions, primarily those conducted in the project&#x27;s infancy and those that were very high in explosive yield.

On Project Gnome and the Sedan test:
Project Plowshare shows how something intended to improve national security can unwittingly do the opposite if it fails to fully consider the social, political, and environmental consequences. It also “underscores that public resentment and opposition can stop projects in their tracks”.
The social scientist Benjamin Sovacool contends that the main problem with oil and gas stimulation, which many considered the most promising economic use of nuclear detonations, was that the produced oil and gas was radioactive, which caused consumers to reject it and this was ultimately the program&#x27;s downfall. Oil and gas are sometimes &quot;naturally&quot; radioactive to begin with, however, and the industry is set up to deal with oil and gas that contain radioactive contaminants. Historian Dr. Michael Payne notes that it was primarily changing public opinion, in response to events such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, that drove the protests, court cases and general hostility that ended the oil and gas stimulation efforts. Furthermore, as the years went by without further development and production of nuclear weapons slowed, interest in peaceful applications waned in the 1950s–60s. Cheaper, non-nuclear stimulation techniques suitable for most US gas fields were developed in the following years.

As a point of comparison, the most successful and profitable nuclear stimulation effort that did not result in customer product contamination issues was the 1976 Project Neva on the Sredne-Botuobinsk gas field in the Soviet Union, made possible by multiple cleaner stimulation explosives, favorable rock strata and the possible creation of an underground contaminant storage cavity. The Soviet Union retains the record for the cleanest/lowest fission-fraction nuclear devices so far demonstrated.

The public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion-only reactions, and therefore created orders of magnitude smaller amounts of long-lived fission products as a result, are the USSR&#x27;s Peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s, with the three detonations that excavated part of Pechora–Kama Canal, being cited as 98% fusion each in the &quot;Taiga&quot; test&#x27;s three 15-kiloton explosive yield devices, that is, a total fission fraction of 0.3 kilotons in a 15 kt device. In comparison, the next three high fusion-yielding devices were all much too high in total explosive yield for oil and gas stimulation: the 50-megaton Tsar Bomba achieved a yield 97% derived from fusion, while in the US, the 9.3-megaton Hardtack Poplar test is reported as 95.2%, and the 4.5-megaton Redwing Navajo test as 95% derived from fusion.

== Nuclear tests ==
The U.S. conducted 27 PNE shots in conjunction with other, weapons-related, test series. A report by the Federation of American Scientists includes yields slightly different from those presented below.

== Non-nuclear tests ==
In addition to the nuclear tests, Plowshare executed a number of non-nuclear test projects in an attempt to learn more about how the nuclear explosives could best be used. Several of these projects led to practical utility as well as to furthering knowledge about large explosives. These projects included:

<text>The Sulu Sea (; Tausug: &quot;Dagat sin Sūg&quot;; ; ) is a body of water in the southwestern area of the Philippines, separated from the South China Sea in the northwest by Palawan and from the Celebes Sea in the southeast by the Sulu Archipelago. Borneo is found to the southwest and Visayas to the northeast.

The Sulu Sea contains a number of islands. The Cuyo Islands and the Cagayan Islands are part of the province of Palawan whereas Mapun and the Turtle Islands are part of the province of Tawi-Tawi. Sulu Sea is also where the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park, one of the World Heritage Sites is located.

Panay Gulf is an extension of the Sulu Sea. Straits out of the Sulu Sea include the Iloilo Strait, the Guimaras Strait, and the Basilan Strait.

==Geography==

<doc id="253900" wikidata="Q739135" url="?curid=253900" title="Princess Tutu">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series created by Ikuko Itoh and directed by Junichi Sato and Shogo Koumoto. Inspired by ballet and fairy tales, particularly &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, its story follows a duck who is transformed into the mythical ballerina Princess Tutu in order to save the shattered heart of a storybook prince come to life.

The series aired from August 2002 to May 2003, with 26 episodes across two seasons, and was also adapted into a two-volume manga series. Both the manga and anime series were licensed for distribution in North America by ADV Films in 2004, then by AEsir Holdings; Sentai Filmworks distributed the Blu-ray release of the anime series, as the latter two are parts of Section23 Films.

==Plot==

There was once a writer named Drosselmeyer, who had the power to make his stories come to life. However, he died before he could finish his final tale, &quot;The Prince and the Raven&quot;, leaving its titular characters locked in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to escape into the real world, and the Prince, Siegfried, pursued him. To seal away the Raven&#x27;s evil, he shattered his heart with his sword, causing him to lose his memories and emotions.

Drosselmeyer, having used his power to write himself as part of the tale to preserve his consciousness, laments that the story has come to a standstill and wants it to become a never-ending tragedy. He finds a way to restart the flow of the story in the form of a duck who has fallen in love with Mytho, the empty remainder of Siegfried. He gives her a magical pendant that can transform her, first into a human girl, then into the ballerina Princess Tutu, another character in the story. As Tutu, Duck is tasked with finding the scattered shards of Mytho&#x27;s heart and returning them to him.

However, not everyone wants Mytho to get his heart back. Rue, the Raven&#x27;s daughter reborn as a human, has also fallen in love with him, and fears that he may not return her feelings if he has a heart. Her desire to prevent him from regaining his emotions awakens her ability to transform into Princess Kraehe, Tutu&#x27;s evil counterpart. Fakir, a boy who found and cared for Mytho after he escaped the story, also tries to stop Tutu, fearing that the story progressing means the Raven will return and Mytho will have to risk his life fighting it again.

As well, Duck learns that part of Princess Tutu&#x27;s story is that she can never confess her love to Mytho, or else she will turn into a speck of light and vanish. However, after it becomes clear that Mytho wants his heart to be restored, she persists despite Fakir and Kraehe&#x27;s interference.

Eventually, Fakir accepts Mytho&#x27;s choice and decides to help Tutu, even discovering her true identity as a duck and befriending her. As he learns he is a descendant of Drosselmeyer and inherited his power to make what he writes a reality, Rue learns she is not the Raven&#x27;s daughter, but a human child he kidnapped to serve him.

After most of Mytho&#x27;s heart is returned to him, the seal imprisoning the Raven begins to break. Finally able to feel love again, Mytho realizes he loves Rue as the Raven kidnaps her. Duck discovers that her pendant is the final shard, meaning she must give up her ability to become human to return it. She eventually finds the courage to do so, and becomes a duck again.

Mytho and the Raven battle once more, but Mytho is outmatched and considers shattering his heart to seal it away again. Duck begins dancing to show him he must not give up. As she does, Fakir writes a story about how she never stops, no matter how many times the Raven&#x27;s minions attack her. Together, they create hope, which gives Mytho the strength he needs to rescue Rue and defeat the Raven. Mytho asks Rue to be his princess and they return to his kingdom inside the story. Duck and Fakir remain together, although the narrator implies that Fakir is writing a new story. With nothing left to do, Drosselmeyer departs in search of another story.

==Media==
===Anime===

&quot;Princess Tutu&quot; was conceptualized by Ikuko Itoh, who also designed the characters, and directed by Junichi Sato and Shogo Koumoto, with Michiko Yokote handling series composition and Kaoru Wada composing the music. It was produced by Hal Film Maker and TUTU, a production committee consisting of King Records, IMAGICA Imageworks, Dentsu, Marvelous Entertainment and Memory-Tech. The series originally aired in two seasons, from August 16, 2002 to May 23, 2003. The first season, &quot;Kapitel des Eies&quot; (&quot;Chapter of the Egg&quot;), consisted of 13 half-hour episodes. The second season, &quot;Kapitel des Junges&quot; (&quot;Chapter of the Fledgling&quot;) in R2 DVDs, and &quot;Kapital des Kükens&quot; (&quot;Chapter of the Chick&quot;) in R1 DVDs, was aired as 25 quarter-hour episodes and one half-hour episode; to conform to the format of the time slot, each episode was halved. These were brought back together in the DVD release as 13 complete episodes.

====North American release====
In 2004, ADV Films announced that they had licensed the anime series for distribution in North America. ADV Films produced English adaptations for all episodes and, beginning in 2005, the series was periodically released as single DVD &quot;volumes&quot; that each contained several episodes. In 2007, the series was released as a complete DVD collection of all 26 episodes. In 2011, AEsir Holdings announced the licensing of the series and the release of a complete DVD collection of all 26 episodes distributed by Section23 Films.

In 2018, as AEsir Holdings and Sentai Filmworks are parts of Section23 Films, the latter released a complete Blu-ray collection of all 26 episodes on December 11, 2018. Steelbook release was made on December 21, 2021. Anime Network formerly offered all 26 episodes of the series, English dubbed only, from their internet streaming site for North America. After the service was shut down, the series was moved to Hidive. Hulu and Amazon Prime Instant Video both have the English dub available for streaming.

===Manga===
A manga adaptation of the anime series was published in Japan by Akita Shoten in the manga magazine &quot;Champion Red&quot; from August 19, 2002 to May 19, 2003. The manga was written by Mizuo Shinonome and series creator Ikuko Itoh and illustrated by Shinonome. Two &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes of the manga were published in 2003. It was translated to English and published in North America by ADV Manga in 2004 and 2005.

====Volumes====


The English version of the manga uses the untranslated Japanese name &quot;Ahiru&quot; rather than the translated &quot;Duck&quot; used in the English version of the anime.

==Reception==
English-language reviews of &quot;Princess Tutu&quot;, both before the official localization and after, have generally been very positive. Reviewers have stated that although &quot;Princess Tutu&quot; is a magical girl series, it is more of a &quot;fairy tale set to ballet with a few magical girl elements mixed in,&quot; and its use of dance in lieu of violence to solve conflicts carries &quot;surprisingly effective emotional appeal.&quot;

<text>Ian Michael Hamilton (31 October 1950 – 19 May 2024) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He made more than 300 appearances in the Football League playing for Chelsea, Southend United, Aston Villa and Sheffield United, and more than 100 in the North American Soccer League for the Minnesota Kicks and the San Jose Earthquakes. He was nicknamed &quot;Chico&quot; after the jazz drummer Chico Hamilton.

==Career==
Hamilton joined Chelsea as a junior and became the Stamford Bridge club&#x27;s youngest ever player and goalscorer at 16 years, 138 days when he scored against Tottenham Hotspur on his debut, on 18 March 1967, a feat which earned comparisons with another famous Chelsea striker who also scored on his debut against Spurs – Jimmy Greaves. Thereafter he played only four more first-team games for Chelsea, spending the 1968–69 season with Southend United before moving to Aston Villa in 1968.

At Villa he carved out a long career as a midfielder, helping the club win the Third Division title in 1972, and playing in two League Cup finals – they lost in 1971 and won in 1975. After two seasons with Sheffield United, Hamilton became one of many British footballers who ended their careers in the North American Soccer League, where he played for Minnesota Kicks and San Jose Earthquakes.

After he finished his professional career, he spent 17 years as boys&#x27; soccer coach at Thomas Worthington High School, in Worthington, Ohio, returning after a seven-year gap to coach girls&#x27; soccer.

==Death==
Hamilton died in May 2024, at the age of 73.

<text>[[Districts of Germany|&quot;Landkreis&quot; (district)]] Ebersberg is located in Upper Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Erding, Mühldorf, Rosenheim and Munich.

==History==
The most important event in the district&#x27;s history was the battle of Hohenlinden on December 3, 1800, which was a part of the Napoleonic Wars.

==Geography==
The district includes rural areas east of the city of Munich. Despite being in the vicinity of Munich, urbanisation is low. In the north there is a contiguous forest area of 80 km², serving as a recreation area for the population of the Bavarian capital. The forest consists of three separate unincorporated areas, &quot;Anzinger Forst&quot;, &quot;Ebersberger Forst&quot;, and &quot;Eglhartinger Forst&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The arms display both parts of the word &quot;Ebersberg&quot;: a boar (German &quot;Eber&quot;) standing on a mountain (German &quot;Berg&quot;). These two symbols are part of the arms of the city of Ebersberg as well. In addition the district&#x27;s arms include a fir, symbolising the forests of the region.

<doc id="253913" wikidata="Q1507305" url="?curid=253913" title="George Elliott Clarke">
<text>George Elliott Clarke (born February 12, 1960) is a Canadian poet, playwright and literary critic who served as the Poet Laureate of Toronto from 2012 to 2015 and as the Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate in 2016-2017. Clarke&#x27;s work addresses the experiences and history of the Black Canadian communities of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, creating a cultural geography coined &quot;Africadia.&quot;

==Life==
Clarke was born to William and Geraldine Clarke in Windsor, Nova Scotia, near the Black Loyalist community of Three Mile Plains and grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He graduated from Queen Elizabeth High School in 1978.

He earned a BA honours degree in English from the University of Waterloo (1984), an MA degree in English from Dalhousie University (1989) and a PhD degree in English from Queen&#x27;s University (1993). He has received honorary degrees from Dalhousie University (LL.D.), the University of New Brunswick (Litt.D.), the University of Alberta (Litt.D.), the University of Waterloo (Litt.D.), and Saint Mary&#x27;s University (Litt.D). He taught English and Canadian Studies at Duke University from 1994 to 1999 and was appointed the Seagrams Visiting Chair in Canadian Studies at McGill University for the academic year 1998-1999.

In 1999, he became professor of English at the University of Toronto where in 2003, he was appointed the inaugural E J Pratt Professor of Canadian Literature. Clarke has also served as a Noted Scholar at the University of British Columbia (2002), as a visiting scholar at Mount Allison University (2005) and as the William Lyon Mackenzie King Visiting Professor in Canadian Studies at Harvard University (2013–14); and outside of the academic sphere, as a researcher for the Ontario Provincial Parliament (1982–83), editor of the Imprint (University of Waterloo, 1984–85) and The Rap (Halifax, 1985–87), social worker for the Black United Front of Nova Scotia (1985–86), parliamentary aide to Howard McCurdy (1987–91) and newspaper columnist for the Halifax &quot;Daily News&quot; (1988–89).

Clarke is active in poetry circles throughout Canada, the US, the Caribbean and Europe. He is also a founding member of the music collective Afro-Métis Nation, which put out its first album, &quot;Constitution&quot;, in May 2019. The group derives its name from the artists&#x27; mixed Africadian and Mi&#x27;kmaq descent. Clarke has described the group&#x27;s sound as &quot;a mash-up of southern-fried blues and saltwater spirituals, with Nashville guitars, Mi’kmaw-and-“African” drums, Highland bagpipes and Acadien fiddles.&quot;

==Writing career==
Clarke has self-published much of his work, including seventeen collections of poetry, two novels and four works of drama and opera. He has also served as editor for collections of African-Canadian writers and poets in anthologies and studies such as &quot;Border Lines&quot; (1995), &quot;Eyeing the North Star&quot; (1997), &quot;Odysseys Home&quot; (2002), &quot;Fire on the Water&quot; (2002), &quot;Directions Home&quot; (2012) and &quot;Locating Home&quot; (2017). His work draws upon a range of literary and artistic traditions (both &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;) and is inclusive of political, historical and spatial themes. His artistic influences include Shakespeare, Miles Davis, Ezra Pound, Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Malcolm X. His poetic and academic careers overlap in their particular emphasis on the perspectives of the African descendants in Canada and Nova Scotia especially the African-American slaves’ descendants who settled on the East coast of Nova Scotia, whom he calls &quot;Africadian.&quot; He writes that it is a word that he &quot;minted from &#x27;Africa&#x27; and &#x27;Acadia&#x27; (the old name for Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), to denote the Black populations of the Maritimes and especially of Nova Scotia.&quot;

Some of his poetry has also been set to music by the a cappella gospel quartet Four the Moment.

He views &quot;Africadian&quot; literature as &quot;literal and liberal—I canonize songs and sonnets, histories and homilies.&quot; Clarke has stated that he found further writing inspiration in the 1970s and his &quot;individualist poetic scored with implicit social commentary&quot; came from the &quot;Gang of Seven&quot; intellectuals, &quot;poet-politicos: jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, troubadour-bard Bob Dylan, libertine lyricist Irving Layton, guerrilla leader and poet Mao Zedong, reactionary modernist Ezra Pound, Black Power orator Malcolm X and the Right Honourable Pierre Elliott Trudeau.&quot; Clarke found &quot;as a whole, the group&#x27;s blunt talk, suave styles, acerbic independence, raunchy macho, feisty lyricism, singing heroic and a scarf-and-beret chivalry quite, well, liberating.&quot; His poetry and scholarship address and challenge historic encounters with racism, segregated areas, discrimination, hatred, forced relocation and a loss of a sense of identity and belonging experienced by the Black populations of Canada.

In his anthology, &quot;Fire On The Water&quot;, Clarke uses a biblical timeline stretching from Genesis to Psalms and Proverbs to Revelation to present Black writings and authors born within a specific period. These names reflect the Africadians’ and other Black peoples’ forebears and the first singers&#x27; own preferences for singing &quot;the Lord’s song in this strange land.&quot; In his book, &quot;These Are the Words&quot;, a collaboration with Canadian poet John B. Lee, Clarke translates one of the nine books of the Bible&#x27;s apocrypha into English vernacular.

In his 2007 play, &quot;Trudeau: Long March, Shining Path&quot;, Clarke describes Pierre Trudeau as &quot;the Shakespearean character: a figure about whom it is almost impossible to say anything definitive because he is encompassed by so many contradictions, but that’s what makes him interesting.&quot; In presenting a multicultural Trudeau on the international stage, Clarke seeks to capture the human dimensions, the personality of Trudeau, rather than his politics, so as to emphasize the dialogues among key characters and &quot;show the people as people, not just exponents of ideas.&quot;
In 2012 Clarke was given substantial critical recognition in a volume devoted to the body of his writing, &quot;Africadian Atlantic: Essays on George Elliott Clarke&quot;, edited by Joseph Pivato.

In his 2016 and 2017 collections of poems, the names of which, &quot;Canticles I (MXXVI)&quot; and &quot;Canticles I (MMXVII)&quot;, are a reference to Ezra Pound&#x27;s The Cantos and The Song of Solomon, Clarke puts famous thinkers, explorers and rulers of the 17th, 18th and 20th centuries into a dialogue on slavery and heritage. Together, these collections make up the first part of a projected three-part epic. Canticles II: MMXIX was released in 2019.

In his time as Poet Laureate of Toronto, Clarke created the Poets&#x27; Corner at City Hall, and worked with the Toronto Public Library to create the Toronto Poetry Map, an electronic map of the city that marks all sites referenced in Canadian poetry and presents the relevant lines to the viewer. He also founded the East End Poetry Festival. Clarke is also the first Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate to have his poems recited in the Houses and recorded in Hansard.

==Family==
Clarke is a great-nephew of the late Canadian opera singer Portia White, politician Bill White and labour union leader Jack White. A seventh-generation African Canadian, Clarke is descended from African-American refugees from the War of 1812 who escaped enslavement in America and were relocated to Nova Scotia. He is the great-grandson of William Andrew White, an American-born Baptist preacher and missionary, army chaplain and radio pioneer, who was one of the very few black officers in the British army worldwide during World War I. Clarke also has Mi&#x27;kmaq Indigenous ancestry.

==Awards and merits==
In 1998, Clarke won the Portia White Prize for Artistic Achievement. In 2001, he won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry for his book &quot;Execution Poems,&quot; as well as the National Magazine Gold Medal for Poetry. He has also won the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Achievement Award (2004), the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Fellowship Prize (2005-2008), the Dartmouth Book Award for Fiction (2006), and the Eric Hoffer Book Award for Poetry (2009).

Clarke was appointed to the Order of Nova Scotia in 2006 and to the Order of Canada, at the rank of Officer, in 2008.

On January 16, 2008, Clarke was made an honorary Fellow of the Haliburton Literary Society, the oldest literary society in North America, at the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax; and in 2009, he was a co-recipient of the William P. Hubbard Award for Race Relations from the City of Toronto for his achievements and commitment in making a distinct difference in racial relations in Toronto. Clarke was chosen expressly for &quot;his local and national leadership role in creating an understanding and awareness of African and black culture and excellence in his contribution to redefining culture.&quot;

In November 2012, Clarke became Toronto&#x27;s fourth Poet Laureate.

In January 2016, Clarke became Canada&#x27;s seventh Parliamentary Poet Laureate.

In 2018, thanks to a gift from Ms. Rebecca Gardiner, the George Elliott Clarke Scholarship Fund was established at Duke University.

His 2021 book &quot;J&#x27;Accuse! (Poem versus Silence)&quot; was shortlisted for the 2022 ReLit Award for poetry.

In 2022, Clarke was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal for his significant service to the province of Nova Scotia in the field of the Arts.

<text>The long-tailed skua or long-tailed jaeger (Stercorarius longicaudus) is a seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;jaeger&quot; is derived from the German word &quot;Jäger&quot;, meaning &quot;hunter&quot;. The English word &quot;skua&quot; comes from the Faroese name &quot;skúgvur&quot; for the great skua, with the island of Skúvoy known for its colony of that bird. The general Faroese term for skuas is &quot;kjógvi&quot; . The genus name &quot;Stercorarius&quot; is Latin and means &quot;of dung&quot;; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement. The specific &quot;longicaudus&quot; is from Latin &quot;longus&quot;, &quot;long&quot;, and &quot;cauda&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;.

==Description==

This species is unmistakable as an adult, with grey back, dark primary wing feathers without a white &quot;flash&quot;, black cap and very long tail. Adults often hover over their breeding territories. Juveniles are much more problematic, and are difficult to separate from parasitic jaeger over the sea. They are slimmer, longer-winged and more tern-like than that species, but show the same wide range of plumage variation. However, they are usually colder toned than Arctic, with greyer shades, rather than brown.

This is the smallest of the skua family at , depending on season and age. However up to of its length can be made up by the tail which may include the tail streamers of the summer adult. The wingspan of this species ranges from and the body mass is .

===Feeding===
When at sea, the long-tailed jaeger will catch fish and other small prey at the surface of the water. During the breeding season (summer in arctic regions, often in mountainous areas) it feeds mainly on lemmings near nesting sites. It will sometimes feed on insects and birds. Like other jaegers and skuas, it is also a kleptoparasite; chasing other seabirds to make them give up their food. This appears to be an important food source during the winter months, spent south of the equator. The bird species most commonly &quot;robbed&quot; this way by the long-tailed jaeger are arctic terns (&quot;Sterna paradisaea&quot;) and sabine’s gulls (&quot;Larus sabini&quot;).

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies are described:
* &quot;S. l. longicaudus&quot; – : nominate, found in northern Scandinavia and Russia.
* &quot;S. l. pallescens&quot; – : found in eastern Siberia, Arctic North America, and Greenland.

==Breeding==

This species breeds in the high Arctic of Eurasia and North America, with major populations in Russia, Alaska and Canada and smaller populations around the rest of the Arctic. It is a migrant, wintering in the south Atlantic and Pacific. Passage juvenile birds sometimes hunt small prey in ploughed fields or golf-courses, and are typically quite fearless of humans.

They nest on dry tundra or higher fells laying two spotted olive-brown eggs. On the breeding grounds they can be heard making yelping and rattling sounds. Outside of the breeding season they spend most of their time over open ocean and have a harsh &quot;kreeah&quot; cry. This bird feeds on fish (mainly caught from other seabirds), smaller birds, food scraps, small mammals, fruit and carrion.

<text>Lynn Coady (born January 24, 1970) is a Canadian novelist and journalist.

==Life and career==
Coady was born and grew up in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. After high school, she attended Carleton University in Ottawa; after graduating, she moved to New Brunswick, where she worked at odd jobs for several years and began a career as a playwright. In 1996, she relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia, where she earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing from the University of British Columbia. In 2006 she moved to Edmonton and taught creative writing at Athabasca University, where she developed a new course in writing the short story. In 2007 moved to Toronto to work at Anansi Press.

Coady&#x27;s first book, &quot;Strange Heaven&quot; (1998), was nominated for a Governor General&#x27;s Award. The novel is set in Nova Scotia, giving Coady the opportunity to paint a different picture of her home province. &quot;Strange Heaven&quot; touches on the life of Bridget Murphy who has been admitted to a psychiatric ward after birthing a child who was put up for adoption. Upon returning to her Cape Breton home Murphy sees everything and everyone in a different light but still manages to find solace in this bizarre and somewhat dysfunctional home.

Coady&#x27;s second book, &quot;Play the Monster Blind&quot; (2000), was a national bestseller and a &quot;Best Book&quot; of 2000 for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. &quot;Saints of Big Harbour&quot; (2002) was a &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; &quot;Best Book&quot; in 2002.

&quot;Mean Boy&quot; was recognized as a &quot;Best Book&quot; in 2006. The novel is a first person account of 19-year-old Lawrence Campbell during his first year of university in a small New Brunswick town. The year is 1975 and Campbell has dreams of becoming a poet. He was drawn away from his rural Prince Edward Island home by the allure of studying with his poet hero, Jim Arsenault. As Campbell progresses through the year, much of Arsenault&#x27;s shine wears off and Campbell learns that people are not always what one expects, but rather are complex and multi-dimensional.

Coady&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;The Antagonist&quot; concerns the life of Gordon Rankin, Coady&#x27;s fictional character known more commonly in the novel as Rank. The character reflects how being cast as a hockey goon and tough guy impacted his life. In response to a novel written about him by an old university friend Rank dedicates himself to providing his own account of events from his past. The reader is brought into Rank&#x27;s world and exposed to his hurts, joys, and ultimately the realization that one must narrate their own lives and reject the labels others may try to give you. This novel was shortlisted for the 2011 Scotiabank Giller Prize;.

Coady&#x27;s 2013 book, &quot;Hellgoing&quot; is a collection of short stories, each about characters going through their own personal versions of hell. Despite this, the stories prompt laughing far more often than tears. This book was the winner of the 2013 Scotiabank Giller Prize.

Coady has been awarded the Canadian Authors Association/Air Canada Award for the best writer under thirty, as well as the Dartmouth Book and Writing Award for fiction. Her articles and reviews have been featured in many publications, including &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;This Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Chatelaine&quot;. She has written several plays, and contributes regularly to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

In 2017, Coady was announced as juror for the 2017 Scotiabank Giller Prize.
Coady now lives in Toronto, Ontario.

<doc id="253933" wikidata="Q182639" url="?curid=253933" title="Exogamy">
<text>Exogamy is the social norm of mating or marrying outside one&#x27;s social group. The group defines the scope and extent of exogamy, and the rules and enforcement mechanisms that ensure its continuity. One form of exogamy is dual exogamy, in which two groups continually intermarry with each other.

In social science, exogamy is viewed as a combination of two related aspects: biological and cultural. Biological exogamy is the marriage of people who are not blood relatives. This is regulated by incest taboos and laws against incest. Cultural exogamy is marrying outside a specific cultural group; the opposite being endogamy, marriage within a social group.

== Biology of exogamy ==
Exogamy often results in two individuals that are not closely genetically related marrying each other; that is, outbreeding as opposed to inbreeding. This may benefit offspring as it reduces the risk of the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Nancy Wilmsen Thornhill states that the drive in humans to not reproduce or be attracted to one&#x27;s immediate family is evolutionarily adaptive, as it reduces the risk of children having genetic defects caused by inbreeding, as a result of inheriting two copies of a deleterious recessive gene.

In one Old Order Amish society, inbreeding increases the risk of &quot;neonatal and postneonatal mortality.&quot; In French populations, the children of first cousins develop cystinosis at a greater rate than the general population.

== Cultural exogamy ==

Cultural exogamy is the custom of marrying outside a specified group of people to which a person belongs. Thus, persons may be expected to marry outside their totem clan(s) or other groups, in addition to outside closer blood relatives.

Researchers have proposed different theories to account for the origin of exogamy. Edvard Westermarck said an aversion to marriage between blood relatives or near kin emerged with a parental deterrence of incest. From a genetic point of view, aversion to breeding with close relatives results in fewer congenital diseases. If one person has a faulty gene, breeding outside his group increases the chances that his partner will have another functional type gene and their child may not suffer the defect. Outbreeding favours the condition of heterozygosity, that is having two nonidentical copies of a given gene.
J. F. McLennan holds that exogamy was due originally to a scarcity of women among small bands. Men were obliged to seek wives from other groups, including marriage by capture, and exogamy developed as a cultural custom.

Émile Durkheim derives exogamy from totemism. He said that a people had religious respect for the blood of a totemic clan, for the clan totem is a god and is present especially in the blood, a sacred substance.

In some forms of Hinduism such as Shaktism, people can only marry outside their gotra which is a traditional group of people who may be distantly related but have been living in the same area or have an ancestral home in the same area.

Morgan maintains that exogamy was introduced to prevent marriage between blood relations, especially between brother and sister, which had been common in an earlier state of promiscuity. Frazer says that exogamy was begun to maintain the survival of family groups, especially when single families became larger political groups.

Claude Lévi-Strauss introduced the &quot;Alliance Theory&quot; of exogamy, that is, that small groups must force their members to marry outside so as to build alliances with other groups. According to this theory, groups that engaged in exogamy would flourish, while those that did not would all die, either literally or because they lacked sufficient ties for cultural and economic exchange, leaving them at a disadvantage. The exchange of men or women served as a uniting force between groups.

=== Dual exogamy ===
Dual exogamy, in which two groups continually intermarry with each other, is a traditional form of arranging marriages in numerous modern societies and in many societies described in classical literature. It can be matrilineal or patrilineal. It is practiced by some Australian tribes, historically widespread in the Turkic societies, Taï societies (Ivory Coast), Eskimo, among Ob-Ugrians and others. In tribal societies, the dual exogamy union lasted for many generations, ultimately uniting the groups initially unrelated by blood or language into a single tribe or nation.

== Linguistic exogamy ==
Linguistic exogamy is a form of cultural exogamy in which marriage occurs between speakers of different languages. The custom is common among French Canadian communities, as well as among indigenous groups in the northwest Amazon, such as the Tucano tribes.

<text>The Allied invasion of Sicily, also known as the Battle of Sicily and Operation Husky, was a major campaign of World War II in which the Allied forces invaded the island of Sicily in July 1943 and took it from the Axis powers (Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany). It began with a large amphibious and airborne operation, followed by a six-week land campaign, and initiated the Italian campaign.

To divert some of the Axis forces to other areas, the Allies engaged in several deception operations, the most famous and successful of which was Operation Mincemeat. Husky began on the night of 9–10 July 1943 and ended on 17 August. Strategically, Husky achieved the goals set out for it by Allied planners: the Allies drove Axis air, land and naval forces from the island, and the Mediterranean sea lanes were opened for Allied merchant ships for the first time since 1941. These events led to the Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini being ousted and the establishment of a new government, and to the Allied invasion of Italy on 3 September.

The German leader, Adolf Hitler, &quot;canceled a major offensive at Kursk after only a week, in part to divert forces to Italy,&quot; resulting in a reduction of German strength on the Eastern Front. The collapse of Italy necessitated German troops replacing the Italians in Italy and to a lesser extent the Balkans, resulting in one-fifth of the entire German army being diverted from the east to southern Europe, a proportion that would remain until near the end of the war.

The plan for Operation Husky called for the amphibious assault of Sicily by two Allied armies, one landing on the south-eastern and one on the central southern coast. The amphibious assaults were to be supported by naval gunfire, as well as tactical bombing, interdiction and close air support by the combined air forces. As such, the operation required a complex command structure, incorporating land, naval and air forces. The overall commander was American General Dwight D. Eisenhower, as Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of all the Allied forces in North Africa. British General Sir Harold Alexander acted as his second-in-command and as the 15th Army Group commander. The American Major General Walter Bedell Smith was appointed as Eisenhower&#x27;s Chief of Staff. The overall Naval Force Commander was the British Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham.

The Allied land forces were from the American, British and Canadian armies, and were structured as two task forces. The Eastern Task Force (also known as Task Force 545) was led by General Sir Bernard Montgomery and consisted of the British Eighth Army (which included the 1st Canadian Infantry Division). The Western Task Force (Task Force 343) was commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton and consisted of the American Seventh Army. The two task force commanders reported to Alexander as commander of the 15th Army Group.

The U.S. Seventh Army consisted initially of three infantry divisions, organized under II Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley. The 1st and 3rd Infantry Divisions, commanded by Major Generals Terry Allen and Lucian Truscott respectively, sailed from ports in Tunisia, while the 45th Infantry Division, under Major General Troy H. Middleton, sailed from the United States via Oran in Algeria. The 2nd Armored Division, under Major General Hugh Joseph Gaffey, also sailing from Oran, was to be a floating reserve and be fed into combat as required. On 15 July, Patton reorganized his command into two corps by creating a new &quot;Provisional Corps&quot; headquarters, commanded by his deputy army commander, Major General Geoffrey Keyes.

The British Eighth Army had four infantry divisions and an independent infantry brigade organized under XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey, and XXX Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese. The two divisions of XIII Corps, the 5th and 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Divisions, commanded by Major-Generals Horatio Berney-Ficklin and Sidney Kirkman, sailed from Suez in Egypt. The formations of XXX Corps sailed from more diverse ports: the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, under Major-General Guy Simonds, sailed from the United Kingdom, the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, under Major-General Douglas Wimberley, from Tunisia and Malta, and the 231st Independent Infantry Brigade Group from Suez.

The 1st Canadian Infantry Division was included in Operation Husky at the insistence of the Canadian Prime Minister, William Mackenzie King, and the Canadian Military Headquarters in the United Kingdom. This request was granted by the British, displacing the veteran British 3rd Infantry Division. The change was not finalized until 27 April 1943, when Lieutenant-General Andrew McNaughton, then commanding the Canadian First Army in the United Kingdom, deemed Operation Husky to be a viable military undertaking and agreed to the detachment of both the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and the 1st Canadian Tank Brigade. The &quot;Red Patch Division&quot; was added to Leese&#x27;s XXX Corps to become part of the British Eighth Army.

In addition to the amphibious landings, airborne troops were to be flown in to support both the Western and Eastern Task Forces. To the east, the British 1st Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General George F. Hopkinson, was to seize vital bridges and high ground in support of the British Eighth Army. The initial plan dictated that the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, was to be held as a tactical reserve in Tunisia.

Allied naval forces were also grouped into two task forces to transport and support the invading armies. The Eastern Naval Task Force was formed from the British Mediterranean Fleet and was commanded by Admiral Bertram Ramsay. The Western Naval Task Force was formed around the U.S. Eighth Fleet, commanded by Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt. The two naval task force commanders reported to Admiral Cunningham as overall Naval Forces Commander. Two sloops of the Royal Indian Navy – and – also participated.

At the time of Operation Husky, the Allied air forces in North Africa and the Mediterranean were organized into the Mediterranean Air Command (MAC) under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. The major sub-command of MAC was the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) under the command of Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz with headquarters in Tunisia. NAAF consisted primarily of groups from the United States 12th Air Force, 9th Air Force, and the British Royal Air Force (RAF) that provided the primary air support for the operation. Other groups from the 9th Air Force under Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton operating from Tunisia and Egypt, and Air H.Q. Malta under Air Vice-Marshal Sir Keith Park operating from the island of Malta, also provided important air support.

The U.S. Army Air Force 9th Air Force&#x27;s medium bombers and P-40 fighters that were detached to NAAF&#x27;s Northwest African Tactical Air Force under the command of Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham moved to southern airfields on Sicily as soon they were secured. At the time, the 9th Air Force was a sub-command of RAF Middle East Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas. Middle East Command, like NAAF and Air H.Q. Malta were sub-commands of MAC under Tedder who reported to Eisenhower for NAAF operations and to the British Chiefs of Staff for Air H.Q. Malta and Middle East Command operations.

===Axis===

The island was defended by the two corps of the Italian 6th Army under General Alfredo Guzzoni, although specially designated Fortress Areas around the main ports (), were commanded by admirals subordinate to Naval Headquarters and independent of the 6th Army. In early July, the total Axis force in Sicily was about 200,000 Italian troops, 32,000 German troops and 30,000 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ground staff. The main German formations were the Panzer Division &quot;Hermann Göring&quot; and the 15th Panzergrenadier Division. The Panzer division had 99 tanks in two battalions but was short of infantry (with only three battalions), while the 15th Panzergrenadier Division had three grenadier regiments and a tank battalion with 60 tanks. About half of the Italian troops were formed into four front-line infantry divisions and headquarters troops; the remainder were support troops or inferior coastal divisions and coastal brigades. Guzzoni&#x27;s defence plan was for the coastal formations to form a screen to receive the invasion and allow time for the field divisions further back to intervene.

By late July, the German units had been reinforced, principally by elements of the 1st Parachute Division, 29th Panzergrenadier Division and the XIV Panzer Corps headquarters (&quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Hans-Valentin Hube), bringing the number of German troops to around 70,000. Until the arrival of the corps headquarters, the two German divisions were nominally under Italian tactical control. The panzer division, with a reinforced infantry regiment from the panzergrenadier division to compensate for its lack of infantry, was under Italian XVI Corps and the rest of the panzergrenadier division under the Italian XII Corps. The German commanders in Sicily were contemptuous of their allies and German units took their orders from the German liaison officer attached to the 6th Army HQ, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin who was subordinate to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, the German C-in-C Army Command South (). Von Senger had arrived in Sicily in late June as part of a German plan to gain greater operational control of its units. Guzzoni agreed from 16 July to delegate to Hube control of all sectors where there were German units involved, and from 2 August, he commanded the Sicilian front.

===Planning===
At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, with the end of the North African Campaign in sight, the political leaders and the military Chiefs of Staff of the United States and Britain met to discuss future strategy. The British Chiefs of Staff were in favour of an invasion of Sicily or Sardinia, arguing that it would force Germany to disperse its forces and might knock Italy out of the war and move Turkey to join the Allies. At first, the Americans opposed the plan as opportunistic and irrelevant, but were persuaded to agree to a Sicilian invasion on the grounds of the great savings to Allied shipping that would result from the opening of the Mediterranean by the removal of Axis air and naval forces from the island. The Combined Chiefs of Staff appointed General Eisenhower as C-in-C of the Allied Expeditionary Force, General Alexander as Deputy C-in-C with responsibility for detailed planning and execution of the operation, Admiral Cunningham as Naval Commander, and Air Chief Marshal Tedder as Air Commander.

The outline plan given to Eisenhower by the Chiefs of Staff involved dispersed landings by brigade and division-sized formations in the south-east, south and north-west areas of the island. The logic behind the plan was that it would result in the rapid capture of key Axis airfields that posed a threat to the beachheads and the invasion fleet lying off them. It would also see the rapid capture of all the main ports on the island, except for Messina, including Catania, Palermo, Syracuse, Licata and Augusta. This would facilitate a rapid Allied build-up, as well as denying their use to the Axis. High-level planning for the operation lacked direction because the three mainland commanders, Alexander, Montgomery, and Patton, were fully occupied in operations in Tunisia. Effort was wasted in presenting plans that Montgomery, in particular, disliked because of the dispersion of forces involved. He was finally able to articulate his objections and put forward alternative proposals on 24 April. Tedder and Cunningham opposed Montgomery&#x27;s plan because it would leave 13 landing grounds in Axis hands, posing a considerable threat to the Allied invasion fleet.

Eisenhower called a meeting for 2 May with Montgomery, Cunningham and Tedder, in which Montgomery made new proposals to concentrate the Allied effort on the southeast corner of Sicily, discarding the intended landings close to Palermo and using the south-eastern ports. After Alexander joined the meeting on 3 May, Montgomery&#x27;s proposals were finally accepted on the basis that it was better to take an administrative risk (having to support troops by landing supplies across beaches) than an operational one (dispersion of effort). Not for the last time, Montgomery had argued a sound course of action, yet done so in a conceited manner, which suggested to others, particularly his American allies, that he was preoccupied with his own interests. In the event, maintaining the armies by landing supplies across the beaches proved easier than expected, partly because of the successful introduction of large numbers of the new amphibious DUKW vehicle. Alexander was later to write &quot;It is not too much to say that the DUKW revolutionised the problem of beach maintenance.&quot;

On 17 May, Alexander issued his Operation Instruction No. 1 setting out his broad plan and defining the tasks of the two armies. Broadly speaking, he intended to establish his armies along a line from Catania to Licata preparatory to a final operation to reduce the island. He later wrote that at that stage it was not practicable to plan further ahead but that his intentions were clear in his own mind what the next step would be: he would drive north ultimately to Santo Stefano on the northern coast to split the island in two and cut his enemy&#x27;s east–west communications. The Seventh Army was assigned to land in the Gulf of Gela, in south-central Sicily, with the 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Armored Division to the west at Licata Mollarella beach, 1st Division in the center at Gela, and 45th Division to the east at Scoglitti. The 82nd Airborne Division was assigned to drop behind the defences at Gela and Scoglitti. The Seventh Army&#x27;s beach-front stretched over . The British Eighth Army was assigned to land in south-eastern Sicily. XXX Corps would land on either side of Cape Passero, while XIII Corps would land in the Gulf of Noto, around Avola, off to the north. The Eighth Army&#x27;s beach front also stretched , and there was a gap of some between the two armies.

====Preparatory operations====
Once the Axis forces had been defeated in Tunisia, the Allied strategic bomber force commenced attacks on the principal airfields of Sardinia, Sicily and southern Italy, industrial targets in southern Italy and the ports of Naples, Messina, Palermo and Cagliari (in Sardinia). The attacks were spread to maintain uncertainty as to the next Allied move, and to pin down Axis aircraft and keep them away from Sicily. Bombing of northern Italy (by aircraft based in the UK) and Greece (by aircraft based in the Middle East) was increased. From 3 July, bombing concentrated on Sicilian airfields and Axis communications with Italy, although beach defences were left alone, to preserve surprise as to where the landings would occur.

By 10 July, only two airfields in Sicily remained fully operational and over half the Axis aircraft had been forced to leave the island. Between mid-May and the invasion, Allied airmen flew 42,227 sorties and destroyed 323 German and 105 Italian aircraft, for the loss of 250 aircraft, mostly to anti-aircraft fire over Sicily.

Operations began in May against the small island of Pantelleria, some southwest of Sicily and northwest of Malta, to prevent the airfield there being used in support of Axis troops attempting to withdraw from North Africa. On 13 and 31 May the cruiser bombarded the island and from 6 June, Allied attacks increased. From 8 May to 11 June 5,285 bombing sorties were flown by fighter-bombers, medium and heavy bombers, dropping a total of 6,202 tons of bombs on the island. The Italian gun positions were reduced to 47% effectiveness by the intense ten-day air bombardment. Out of 112 guns bombed, 2 had suffered from direct hits, 17 were near misses and 34 were damaged by debris and splinters (10 beyond repair). All control communications were destroyed, along with many gun emplacements and ammunition stores.

On 11 June, after a naval bombardment and seaborne landing by the British 1st Infantry Division (Operation Corkscrew) the island garrison surrendered. The Pelagie Islands of Lampedusa and Linosa, some west of Malta, followed in short order on 12 June.

====Headquarters====

The Allies used a network of tunnels and chambers located below the Lascaris Battery in Valletta, Malta (the &quot;Lascaris War Rooms&quot;), for the advance headquarters of the invasion of Sicily. In July 1943, General Eisenhower, Admiral Cunningham, General Montgomery, and Air Marshal Tedder occupied the war rooms. Earlier, the war rooms had served as the British headquarters for the defence of Malta.

====Deception====
To distract the Axis, and if possible divert some of their forces to other areas, the Allies engaged in several deception operations. The most famous and successful of these was Operation Mincemeat, conceived by Naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu and RAF Squadron Leader Charles Cholmondeley. The British allowed a corpse, disguised as a British Royal Marines officer, to drift ashore in Spain carrying a briefcase containing fake secret documents. The documents purported to reveal that the Allies were planning &quot;Operation Brimstone&quot; and that an &quot;Operation Husky&quot; was an invasion of Greece. German intelligence accepted the authenticity of the documents and the Germans diverted much of their defensive effort from Sicily to Greece until the occupation of Pantelleria on 11 June, which concentrated German and Italian attention on the western Mediterranean. &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel was sent to Greece to assume command. The Germans transferred a group of &quot;R boats&quot; (German minesweepers and minelayers) from Sicily and laid three additional minefields off the Greek coast. They also moved three panzer divisions to Greece, one from France and two from the Eastern Front which reduced German combat strength in the Kursk salient.

==Campaign==
===Allied landings===
====Airborne landings====

Two American and two British attacks by airborne troops were carried out just after midnight on the night of 9–10 July, as part of the invasion. The American paratroopers consisted largely of Colonel James M. Gavin&#x27;s 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (expanded into the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team with the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, along with the 456th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, Company &#x27;B&#x27; of the 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion and other supporting units) of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, making their first combat drop. The British landings were preceded by pathfinders of the 21st Independent Parachute Company, who were to mark landing zones for the troops who were intending to seize the Ponte Grande, the bridge over the River Anape just south of Syracuse, and hold it until the British 5th Infantry Division arrived from the beaches at Cassibile, some to the south. Glider infantry from the British 1st Airborne Division&#x27;s 1st Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks, were to seize landing zones inland.

Strong winds of up to blew the troop-carrying aircraft off course and the American force was scattered widely over south-east Sicily between Gela and Syracuse. By 14 July, about two-thirds of the 505th had managed to concentrate, and half the U.S. paratroopers failed to reach their rallying points. The British air-landing troops fared little better, with only 12 of the 147 gliders landing on target and 69 crashing into the sea, with over 200 men drowning. Among those who landed in the sea were Major General George F. Hopkinson, commander of the British 1st Airborne Division, who, after several hours spent clutching a piece of wreckage, was eventually rescued by the landing ship HMS &quot;Keren&quot;. The scattered airborne troops attacked patrols and created confusion wherever possible. A platoon of the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment, under Lieutenant Louis Withers, part of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade, landed on target, captured Ponte Grande and repulsed counterattacks. Additional paratroops rallied to the sound of shooting and by 08:30 were holding the bridge. By 11:30, a battalion of the Italian 75th Infantry Regiment (Colonel Francesco Ronco) from the 54th Infantry Division &quot;Napoli&quot; arrived with some artillery. The British force held out until about 15:30 hours, when, low on ammunition and by now reduced to 18 men, they were forced to surrender, 45 minutes before the leading elements of the British 5th Division arrived from the south. Despite these mishaps, the widespread landing of airborne troops, both American and British, had a positive effect as small isolated units, acting on their initiative, attacked vital points and created confusion.

====Seaborne landings====

The strong wind also made matters difficult for the amphibious landings but also ensured surprise as many of the defenders had assumed that no one would attempt a landing in such poor conditions. Landings were made in the early hours of 10 July from 2:45am on 26 main beaches spread along of the southern and eastern coasts of the island between the town of Licata where the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott, landed at Torre di Gaffe, red beach, and Mollarella and Poliscia, green beaches in the west, and Cassibile in the east, with British and Canadian forces in the east and Americans toward the west. This constituted the largest amphibious operation of World War II in terms of size of the landing zone and the number of divisions put ashore on the first day. The Italian defensive plan did not contemplate a pitched battle on the beaches and so the landings themselves were somewhat anticlimactic.

More trouble was experienced from the difficult weather conditions (especially on the southern beaches) and unexpected hidden offshore sandbars than from the coastal divisions. Some troops landed in the wrong place, in the wrong order and as much as six hours behind schedule, but the weakness of the defensive response allowed the Allied force to make up lost time. Nevertheless, several Italian coastal units fought well; the 429th Coastal Battalion (under Major Marco Rubellino), tasked with defending Gela and its beachhead, had lost 45 percent of its men, while the attacking U.S. Army Ranger Battalion lost several men to mines and machine-gun and cannon fire. &quot;Gruppo Tattico Carmito&quot; (under Lieutenant-Colonel Francesco Tropea), tasked with defending Malati Bridge, defeated a Royal Marines Commando Battalion on 13 July with the help of the local middle-age reservists. The Italian 4th Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion attacked the Commandos with the help of the 372nd Coastal Defence Battalion, 553rd (under Captain Giovanni Sartor) and 554th (under Captain Fausto Clementi) Motorcycle Companies, and three Panzer IV medium tanks. The 246th Coastal Battalion (under Major Rollo Franco) defeated British attempts to capture Augusta on the night of 11–12 July.

In Major General Terry Allen&#x27;s U.S. 1st Infantry Division sector at Gela, there was an Italian division-sized counterattack where the dispersed 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team was supposed to have been. Tiger tanks of the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, which had been due to advance with the 4th Infantry Division &quot;Livorno&quot;, were late.

On highways 115 and 117 during 10 July, Italian tanks of the &quot;Niscemi&quot; Armoured Combat Group and Livorno Division infantry nearly reached the Allied position at Gela, but gunfire from the destroyer and the light cruiser destroyed several tanks and dispersed the attacking infantry battalion. The 3rd Battalion, 34th Regiment, &quot;Livorno&quot; Infantry Division, composed mainly of conscripts, made a daylight attack on the Gela beachhead two days later, with infantry and armor of the Hermann Göring Panzer Division, but was repulsed.

By the morning of 10 July, the Joint Task Force Operations Support System Force captured the port of Licata, at the cost of nearly 100 killed and wounded in the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division, and the division beat back a counter-attack from the 538th Coastal Defence Battalion. By 11:30, Licata was firmly in American hands and the U.S. 3rd Division had lost fewer than one hundred men. Salvage parties had already partially cleared the harbor, and shortly after noon Truscott and his staff came ashore and set up headquarters at Palazzo La Lumia. About that time, the 538th Coastal Defense Battalion, which had been deployed as a tactical reserve, launched a counter-attack. By the evening of 10 July, the seven Allied assault divisions—three American, three British and one Canadian—were well established ashore, the port of Syracuse had been captured, and fears of an Axis air onslaught had proved unfounded.

The preparatory bombing of the previous weeks had greatly weakened the Axis air capability and the heavy Allied presence of aircraft operating from Malta, Gozo, and Pantelleria kept most of the Axis attempts at air attack at bay. Some attacks on the first day of the invasion got through, and German aircraft sank the landing ship &quot;LST-313&quot; and minesweeper . Italian Stukas sank the destroyer and Re.2002s sunk the Indian hospital ship with heavy loss of life, and in the following days Axis aircraft damaged or sank several more warships, transport vessels and landing craft starting with the Allied troopship hit and damaged by an Italian bomber formation on the morning of 11 July. Italian Stukas (named &quot;Picchiatello&quot; in Italian service) and Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 torpedo-bombers coordinated their attacks with German Stuka and Ju 88 bomber units. As part of the seaborne landings south at Agnone, some 400 men of Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater&#x27;s No. 3 Commando captured Malati Bridge on 13 July, only to lose possession of it when the 4th Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Francesco Tropea) and the Italian 553rd and 554th Motorcycle Companies counter-attacked. The Commandos lost 28 killed, 66 wounded and 59 captured or missing.

===Exploitation===
Alexander&#x27;s plan was to first establish his forces on a line between Licata in the west and Catania in the east before embarking on operations to reduce the rest of the island. Key to this was capturing ports to facilitate the buildup of his forces and the capture of airfields. The task of Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army was, therefore, to capture the Pachino Airfield on Cape Passero and the port of Syracuse before moving northwards to take the ports of Augusta and Catania. Their objectives also included the landing fields around Gerbini, on the Catania plain. The objectives of Patton&#x27;s Seventh Army included capturing the port of Licata and the airfields of Ponte Olivo, Biscari and Comiso. It was then to prevent the enemy reserves from moving eastward against the Eighth Army&#x27;s left flank.

According to Axis plans, (Colonel Wilhelm Schmalz), in conjunction with the 54th Infantry Division &quot;Napoli&quot; (Major-General Giulio Cesare Gotti Porcinari), was to counter-attack an Allied landing on the Augusta–Syracuse coast. On 10 July, Schmalz had been unable to contact the Italian division and had proceeded alone towards Syracuse. Unknown to Schmalz, a battalion of 18 Renault R35 tanks (under Lieutenant-Colonel Massimo D&#x27;Andretta) and supporting infantry battalion from the 75th Infantry Regiment (under Colonel Paolo Giovanni Ronco) of the Napoli Division, broke through the forward positions held by the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, part of the 13th Brigade the British 5th Division, and were stopped only by anti-tank and artillery fire in the Priolo and Floridia suburbs of Syracuse.

On the night of 11–12 July, the Royal Navy attempted to capture Augusta but the 246th Coastal Battalion repelled the British landing force that was supported by three destroyers. On 12 July, several Italian units took up rearguard positions and covered the withdrawal of and the Hermann Göring Division. The American advance toward Canicattì was temporarily held up by Semovente da 90/53 tank destroyers from the 161st Self-propelled Artillery Battalion, 526th Bersaglieri Battalion and 177th Bersaglieri Regiment from &quot;Gruppo Tattico Venturi&quot; (under General Enrico Francisci, killed in action and posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour), as retreated toward Catania. The 246th Coastal Battalion retreated to strong points at Cozzo Telegrafo and Acquedolci. The 76th Infantry Regiment of the Napoli Division covered the left flank of which withdrew toward Lentini and then retired to Palermo. The Hermann Göring Division eventually pulled back from the Piano Lupo area toward Caltagirone and the Livorno Division withdrew its right flank toward Piazza Armerina, to cover the Hermann Göring Division.

Early on 13 July, elements of the British 5th Division on Eighth Army&#x27;s right flank, which had been delayed by , entered Augusta. On their left, British 50th Division had pushed up Route 114 toward Lentini, northwest of Augusta and met increasing resistance from the Napoli Division. The commander of the Italian division and his staff were captured by the British 4th Armoured Brigade on 13 July and it was not until 18:45 on 14 July that the town was cleared of obstructions and snipers and the advance resumed. A battalion of the Napoli Division managed to break through the British lines and took up new positions at Augusta but the British advance forced it to retire again on 14 July.

Further left, in the XXX Corps sector, the 51st (Highland) Division had moved directly north to take Palazzolo and Vizzini west of Syracuse, while the Canadians secured Pachino airfield and headed north-west to make contact with the American right wing at Ragusa; after having driven off the Italian 122 Infantry Regiment north of Pachino. The Canadians captured more than 500 Italians. In the Canadian area, the 2nd Special Service Brigade, under Brigadier Robert Laycock, was counter-attacked by the 206th Coastal Division (under General Achille d&#x27;Havet) who launched a strong counter-attack that threatened to penetrate the area between the Canadians and the Royal Marine Commandos before being repulsed.

In the American sector, by the morning of 10 July, the port of Licata had been captured. On 11 July, Patton ordered his reserve parachute troops from the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (minus the 3rd Battalion already deployed in Sicily, attached to the 505th) under Colonel Reuben Tucker, part of 82nd Airborne Division, to drop and reinforce the center. In addition, going along with the 504th would be the 376th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, Company &#x27;C&#x27; of the 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion and other supporting units. Warning orders had been issued to the fleet and troops on 6, 7, 10 and 11 July concerning the planned route and timing of the drop, so that the aircraft would not be fired on by friendly forces. They were intended to drop east of Ponte Olivo, about inland from Gela, to block routes to the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s bridgehead at Gela.

The 144 Douglas C-47 transports arrived at the same time as an Axis air raid; the first echelon of troop carrying planes had dropped their loads without interference, when an Allied naval vessel fired on the formation. Immediately, all the other naval vessels and shore troops joined in, shooting down friendly aircraft and forcing paratroopers to jump far from their drop zones. The 52nd Troop Carrier Wing lost 23 of 144 С-47s to friendly fire; there were 318 casualties with 83 dead. Thirty-seven aircraft were damaged, while eight returned to base without dropping their parachutists. The paratroopers suffered 229 casualties to &quot;friendly fire&quot;, including 81 dead. Among the casualties was Brigadier General Charles L. Keerans, Jr., the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s assistant division commander (ADC), who was along with the 504th as an unofficial observer. The 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, part of the 82nd Airborne Division and commanded by Colonel Harry L. Lewis, was then waiting in North Africa and scheduled to land in Sicily by glider that night, together with the rest of the division staff. After what happened to the 504th, Ridgway canceled the operation.

Despite this, the American beach landings went well and a substantial amount of supplies and transport was landed. Despite the failure of the airborne operation, the 1st Infantry Division took Ponte Olivo on 12 July and continued north, while 45th Infantry Division on the right had taken the airfield at Comiso and entered Ragusa to link-up with the Canadians. On the left, the 3rd Infantry Division, having landed at Licata, pushed troops up the coast almost to Argento and inland to Canicatti.

Once the beachheads were secure, Alexander planned to split the island in half by thrusting north through the Caltanissetta and Enna region, to deny the defenders the central east–west lateral road. A further push north to Nicosia would cut the next lateral route and a final advance to Santo Stefano on the north coast would cut the coastal route. In new orders issued on 13 July, he gave this task to Eighth Army, perhaps based on a somewhat over-optimistic situation report by Montgomery late on 12 July, while the Seventh Army were to continue their holding role on the left flank of the Eighth Army, despite what appeared to be an opportunity for them to make a bold offensive move. On 12 July, Kesselring had visited Sicily and formed the opinion that German troops were fighting virtually on their own. As a consequence, he concluded that the German formations needed to be reinforced, and that western Sicily should be abandoned in order to shorten the front line. The priority was first to slow and then halt the Allied advance, while a was formed running from San Stefano on the northern coast, through Nicosia and Agira to Cantenanuova and from there to the eastern coast south of Catania.

While XIII Corps continued to push along the Catania road, XXX Corps were directed north along two routes; the first was an inland route through Vizzini, and the second following Route 124, which cut across the U.S. 45th Infantry Division, which had to return to the coast at Gela for redeployment behind the U.S. 1st Infantry Division. Progress was slow as skilfully delayed the British 5th Infantry Division, allowing time for two regiments from the German 1st Parachute Division flying to Catania to deploy. On 12 July, the British 1st Parachute Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, had been dropped in Operation Fustian, an attempt to capture the Primosole Bridge over the river Simeto, on the southern edge of the Catania plain. The British paratroopers suffered heavy casualties over their designated drop zones due to heavy fire from alert Italian anti-aircraft gunners, but managed to seize and hold the bridge against fierce Axis attacks. The initial counterattacks were Italian in the form of reinforcements from the 10th Arditi Paratroop Regiment (Major Vito Marciano), reservists from the 372nd Coastal Battalion (Major Nino Bolla) and gunners from the 29th Artillery Group fighting in the infantry role and an armoured car squadron that nearly overran the headquarters of 9th Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry, at nightfall in the first day of the battle for Primosole Bridge. The British 5th Division was delayed by strong opposition, but made contact early on 15 July; nevertheless, it was not until 17 July that a shallow bridgehead north of the river was consolidated.

On 16 July, the surviving Italian aircraft withdrew to the mainland. About 160 Italian planes had been lost in the first week of the invasion, 57 lost to Allied fighters and anti-aircraft fire on 10–12 July alone. That day, an Italian bomber torpedoed the aircraft carrier , and the torpedoed the cruiser . Both ships were put out of action for over a year.

On the night of 17 July, the , equipped with EC.3 &quot;Gufo&quot; radar, detected and engaged four British Elco motor torpedo boats lurking away, while passing the Strait of Messina at high speed. MTB 316 was sunk and MTB 313 damaged between Reggio di Calabria and Pellaro–twelve British sailors were killed.

On the night of 17–18 July, Montgomery renewed his attack toward Catania, with two brigades of the 50th Division. They met strong opposition and by 19 July Montgomery decided to call off the attack and instead increase the pressure on his left. The 5th Division attacked on the 50th Division&#x27;s left but with no greater success, and on 20 July, the 51st Division, further west, crossed the river Dittaino at Sferro and made for the Gerbini airfields. They too were driven back by counter-attacks on 21 July. On the left flank, the 1st Canadian Division continued to advance but it was becoming clear that, as German units settled into their new positions in north eastern Sicily, the army would not have sufficient strength to carry the whole front and the Canadians were ordered to continue north to Leonforte and then turn eastward to Adrano on the south-western slopes of Mount Etna, instead of an encirclement of Mount Etna using Route 120 to Randazzo. Montgomery called forward his reserve division from North Africa, the British 78th Infantry Division.

Patton had reorganised his forces into two corps. The Provisional Corps, commanded by Keyes, consisting of the 2nd Armored, 3rd Infantry, and 82nd Airborne Divisions, was on the left. The U.S. II Corps was on the right. By 17 July, Provisional Corps had captured Porto Empedocle and Agrigento. On 18 July, II Corps took Caltanissetta, just short of Route 121, the main east–west lateral through the center of Sicily. The American advance toward Agrigento was temporarily held up by the 207th Coastal Defence Division (under Colonel Augusto De Laurentis) that was at Sant&#x27;Oliva Station, inland from Licata. The 10th Bersaglieri Regiment forced the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions of the 3rd Infantry Division to fight their way into Agrigento. By late afternoon on 16 July, the city was in American hands.

The 15th Panzer Grenadier Division managed to join the other German formations in the east of the island. Patton was ordered on 18 July to push troops north through Petralia on Route 120, the next east–west lateral, and then to cut the northern coast road. After that, he would mop up the west of the island. II Corps were given the task of making the northward move, while the Provisional Corps was tasked with the mopping up operation. Alexander issued further orders to Patton to develop an eastward threat along the coast road once he had cut it. He was also directed to capture Palermo as quickly as possible as the main supply base for further eastward commitment north of Mount Etna. On 21 July, the Seventh Army&#x27;s Provisional Corps overran the Italian battlegroup &quot;Raggruppamento Schreiber&quot; (under General Ottorino Schreiber), covering the withdrawal of the 15th &quot;Panzer Panzergrenadier &quot;Division, but Patton lost 300 men killed and wounded in the process. On 22 July, the Provisional Corps entered Palermo, and the next day the 45th Division cut the north coast road.

===Battles for Etna positions===
During the last week in July, Montgomery gathered his forces to renew the attack on 1 August. His immediate objective was Adrano, the capture of which would split the German forces on either side of Mount Etna. During the week, the Canadians and the 231st Brigade Group continued their eastward push from Leonforte, and on 29 July had taken Agira, some west of Adrano. On the night of 29 July, the British 78th Division with the 3rd Canadian Brigade under command, took Catenuova and made a bridgehead across the river Dittaino. On the night of 1 August, they resumed their attack to the northwest toward Centuripe, an isolated pinnacle of rock, which was the main southern outpost of the Adrano defences. After heavy fighting against the Hermann Göring Division and the 3rd Parachute Regiment all day on 2 August, the town was finally cleared of defenders on the morning of 3 August. The capture of Centuripe proved critical, in that the growing threat to Adrano made the position covering Catania untenable.

Patton had decided that his communications could support two divisions pushing east, the 45th Division on the coast road and the 1st Division on Route 120. In order to maintain the pressure, he relieved the 45th Division with the fresher 3rd Division and called up the 9th Infantry Division from reserve in North Africa to relieve the 1st Division. Axis forces were now settled on a second defensive line, the Etna Line, running from San Fratello on the north coast through Troina and Aderno. On 31 July, the 1st Division with elements of the arriving 9th Division attached, reached Troina and the Battle of Troina commenced. This important position was held by the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division. The remnants of the 28th Infantry Division &quot;Aosta&quot; in the form of four battalions had also been pulled back to Troina to assist in the defensive preparations and forthcoming battle.

For six days, the Germans and Italians conducted a costly defence; during the battle, they launched 24 counter-attacks and many small local ones. By 7 August, the U.S. 18th Infantry Regiment, of the 9th Division, had captured Mount Pellegrino, which overlooked the Troina defences, allowing accurate direction of Allied artillery. The defenders&#x27; left flank was also becoming exposed as the adjacent Hermann Göring Division was pushed back by the British XXX Corps and they were ordered to withdraw that night in phases to the defensive positions of the Tortorici Line. Elements of the 29th Panzergrenadier Division and 26th Infantry Division &quot;Assietta&quot; were also proving difficult to dislodge on the coast at Santa Agata and San Fratello. Patton sent a small amphibious force behind the defences, which led to the fall of Santa Agata on 8 August after holding out for six days.

On 3 August, XIII Corps exploited the disorganisation caused by the threat to Adrano and resumed their advance on Catania, and by 5 August the town was in their hands. Adrano fell to the 78th Division on the night of 6 August, while on the right, the 51st (Highland) Division took Biancavilla, southeast of Adrano. After the fall of Adrano, the 1st Canadian Division was withdrawn into Army Reserve. On 8 August, the 78th Division, moving north from Adrano, took Bronte, and the 9th Division, advancing from Troina, took Cesaro, valuable positions on the New Hube Line. Both divisions converged on Randazzo, on the north-west slopes of Etna. Randazzo fell on 13 August and 78th Division was taken into reserve. As the Allied advance continued, the front line shortened. On 10 August, Montgomery decided to withdraw XIII Corps HQ and the British 5th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Gerard Bucknall (replacing Major General Berney-Ficklin, who returned to England), to allow them to prepare for the landings on mainland Italy. On the northern coast, the U.S. 3rd Division continued to meet strong resistance and difficulties created by extensive demolition of the road. Two more end-run amphibious attacks, and the rebuilding efforts of the engineers, kept the advance moving. Although Kesselring had already decided to evacuate, the Axis forces continued their delaying tactics, assisted by the favorable defensive terrain of the Messina Peninsula. Finally, on the night of 16 August, the leading elements of 3rd Division entered Messina.

===Axis evacuation===

By 27 July, the Axis commanders had realised that the outcome of the campaign would be an evacuation from Messina. Kesselring reported to Hitler on 29 July that an evacuation could be accomplished in three days and initial written plans were formulated dated 1 August. However, when Hube suggested on 4 August that a start should be made by transferring superfluous men and equipment, Guzzoni refused to sanction the idea without the approval of the &quot;Comando Supremo&quot;. The Germans nevertheless went ahead, transferring over 12,000 men, 4,500 vehicles and 5,000 tons of equipment from 1–10 August. On 6 August, Hube suggested to Guzzoni, via von Senger, that HQ 6th Army should move to Calabria. Guzzoni rejected the idea but asked if Hube had decided to evacuate Sicily. Von Senger replied that Hube had not.

The next day, Guzzoni learned of the German plan for evacuation and reported to Rome of his conviction of their intentions. On 7 August, Guzzoni reported that, without German support, any last ditch stand would only be short. On 9 August, Rome ordered that Guzzoni&#x27;s authority should be extended to Calabria and that he should transfer some forces there to reinforce the area. On 10 August, Guzzoni informed Hube that he was responsible for the defence of northeast Sicily and that Italian coastal units and the Messina garrison were under his command. Guzzoni then crossed to the mainland with 6th Army HQ and 16th Corps HQ, leaving Admiral Pietro Barone and Admiral Pietro Parenti to organise the evacuation of the remains of the Livorno and Assietta divisions (and any other troops and equipment that could be saved).

The German plan was thorough, with clear lines of command imposing strict discipline on the operation. &quot;Oberst&quot; Ernst-Günther Baade was the German Commandant Messina Straits, with Fortress Commander powers, including control over infantry, artillery, anti-aircraft, engineer and construction, transport and administration units as well as German naval transport headquarters. On the mainland, &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Richard Heidrich, who had remained in Calabria with the 1st Parachute Division headquarters and the 1st Parachute Regiment, when the rest of the division had been sent as reinforcements to Sicily, was appointed XIV Panzer Corps Mainland Commander to receive evacuating formations, while Hube continued to control the operations on the island.
Full-scale withdrawal, codenamed Operation Lehrgang, began on 11 August and continued to 17 August. During this period, Hube ordered successive withdrawals each night of between , keeping the following Allied units at arm&#x27;s length with the use of mines, demolitions and other obstacles. As the peninsula narrowed, shortening his front, he was able to withdraw units for evacuation. The Allies attempted to counter this by launching brigade-sized amphibious assaults, one each by the Seventh and Eighth Armies, on 15 August. However, the speed of the Axis withdrawal was such that these operations &quot;hit air&quot;.

The German and Italian evacuation schemes proved highly successful. The Allies were not able to prevent the orderly withdrawal nor effectively interfere with transports across the Strait of Messina. The narrow straits were protected by 120 heavy and 112 light anti-aircraft guns, with about half being Italian-built pieces. The resulting overlapping gunfire from both sides of the strait was described by Allied pilots as worse than the Ruhr, making daylight air attacks highly hazardous and generally unsuccessful. Night attacks were less hazardous and there were times when air attack was able to delay and even suspend traffic across the straits but when daylight returned, the Axis were able to clear the backlog from the previous night. Nor was naval interdiction any more practicable. The straits varied from wide and were covered by artillery up to in caliber. This, combined with the hazards of a current and fear that Italian warships were preparing to attack the Straits of Messina in a suicide run, made risking warships unjustifiable.

==Aftermath==
On 18 August, the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; recorded that 60,000 troops had been recovered and the Italian figure was about 75,000. In 2004, Tomblin wrote that the Italians evacuated 62,182 men, 41 guns and 227 vehicles with the loss of only one motor raft and the train ferry &quot;Cariddi&quot;, which was scuttled when Allied troops entered Messina. The Germans evacuated some 52,000 troops (including 4,444 wounded), 14,105 vehicles, 47 tanks, 94 guns, 1,100 tons of ammunition, and about 20,700 tons of gear and stores.

===Casualties===

The U.S. Seventh Army lost 8,781 men (2,237 killed or missing, 5,946 wounded, and 598 captured), while the British Eighth Army suffered 11,843 casualties (2,062 killed or missing, 7,137 wounded and 2,644 captured). The U.S. Navy lost 546 killed or missing and 484 wounded and the Royal Navy lost 314 killed or missing, 411 wounded and four captured. The USAAF reported 28 killed, 88 missing and 41 wounded. Canadian forces had suffered 2,310 casualties, including 562 killed, 1,664 wounded, and 84 captured.

In 2007, Samuel W. Mitcham and Friederich von Stauffenberg wrote that German units lost about 20,000 men who were either killed, wounded or captured, and in &quot;Germany and the Second World War&quot; (2007) Messerschmidt &quot;et al.&quot; reported that the German forces lost 4,325 men killed, 4,583 missing, 5,532 captured and 13,500 wounded, a total of 27,940 casualties. According to the Historical Branch of the Italian Army, Italian military losses were 4,678 killed, 36,072 missing, 32,500 wounded and 116,681 captured. A large part of the missing were presumed to have been killed and buried on the battlefield or in unknown locations, whereas another part presumably included locally recruited soldiers who deserted and returned to their homes. In 2007, Mitcham and Von Stauffenberg estimated Italian total casualties as 147,000. An earlier Canadian study of the Allied invasion estimated the total number of Italian and Germans taken prisoner in Sicily to be around 100,000.

===War crimes===

Immediately after Allied landings, a number of instances where American troops killed civilians were reported. These included a massacre at Vittoria, where 12 civilians were killed, including the podestà of Acate, another at Agrigento, and the Canicattì massacre, in which Lieutenant-Colonel George Herbert McCaffrey fired into a civilian crowd looting a factory in Canicattì which refused to disperse, killing eight. During and after the invasion, Allied troops committed a number of rapes and other forms of sexual assaults against civilians in Sicily; Italian statistics report a number of rapes committed by American and Free French forces. According to historian Clive Emsley, the record books of the British Special Investigation Branch recorded &quot;a few&quot; instances of rape and sexual harassment involving British servicemembers during the invasion. On 19 July, just over a week after the Allied landings, Captain Angelo Thomas Sesia, a Canadian Army officer in the 1st Canadian Division, recorded that fellow Canadian troops were involved in a number of &quot;unsettling incidents&quot;, including looting, shooting at civilians and one gang rape in Piazza Armerina. According to Mitcham and von Stauffenberg, Canadian troops of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment summarily executed German prisoners of war during the invasion.

On 14 July, American troops of the 180th Infantry Regiment summarily executed 73 Axis prisoners of war in two separate incidents. After capturing 45 Italian and 3 German POWs while attacking an airfield near Santo Pietro, a regimental detachment led by Sergeant Horace T. West marched the POWs for approximately a mile before West directed that &quot;eight or nine&quot; be separated from the rest and taken to the regiment&#x27;s intelligence officer for questioning; West proceeded to summarily execute the remaining 37 POWs. On the next day, the 37 bodies were spotted by an American military chaplain, Lieutenant-Colonel William E. King. King reported the incident to his superiors, who at first dismissed it due to the bad press which would occur if it were made public; however, after some convincing, they agreed to court-martial West. Troops from the 180th Infantry Regiment committed another massacre on 14 July, when Captain John T. Compton ordered 35 Italian POWs to be summarily executed by firing squad. West and Compton were charged by the United States Army with committing a war crime; West was convicted and sentenced to life in prison and stripped of his rank but was released back to active service in November 1944 as a private, and honorably discharged at the end of his service. Compton was charged with killing 40 prisoners in his charge but was acquitted and transferred to another regiment, where he died in November 1943 while fighting in the Italian campaign.

<text>Karen Marie Connelly (born 12 March 1969) is a Canadian travel writer, novelist and poet who has written extensively about her experiences living in Greece, Thailand and Canada.

==Life and work==
Connelly was born in Calgary, Alberta. At seventeen, she lived in a Thai village thanks to a Rotary exchange scholarship. She returned to Canada a year later. At nineteen, she left for Spain, where she lived almost two years. Having no work visa, she supported herself by, among other things, teaching English as a second language. In her spare time, she wrote about her experiences and took photographs with which to illustrate her writing. She also reworked the letters and journals, which she had written in Thailand, into a manuscript that was to become &quot;Touch the Dragon&quot; by Karen Connelly.

In 1991, she moved to France and settled in Montclar, Avignon, where she studied French and Spanish. Soon after, she travelled to Greece, spending most of her time on the island of Lesbos, to which she has occasionally returned. She then moved back to Canada for an extended period, writing and promoting her work.

Her first book, a poetry collection entitled &quot;The Small Words in My Body&quot; (1990), won the Pat Lowther Award for poetry in 1991. Her second book, &quot;Touch the Dragon: A Thai Journal&quot; (1992), won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language non-fiction.

Three poetry collections followed, &quot;This Brighter Prison&quot; (1993) &quot;The Disorder of Love&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Border Surrounds Us&quot; (2000). She also compiled a book of letters, &quot;One Room in a Castle,&quot; detailing her experiences in Europe.

In 1996, she returned to Thailand and also visited Myanmar (she prefers the older name, Burma). Her experiences there served as the basis for her novel about a political prisoner, &quot;The Lizard Cage,&quot; which won the Orange Award for New Writers and was longlisted for the 2007 International Dublin Literary Award.

Connelly remained in Thailand for two years before returning to Canada, where she married. She lives in Toronto.

<doc id="253946" wikidata="Q166944" url="?curid=253946" title="Nad Tatrou sa blýska">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Slovakia. The origins of it are in the Central European activism of the 19th century. Its main themes are a storm over the Tatra mountains that symbolized danger to the Slovaks, and a desire for a resolution of the threat. It used to be particularly popular during the 1848–1849 insurgencies.

It was one of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s dual national anthems and was played in many Slovak towns at noon; this tradition ceased to exist after Czechoslovakia split into two different states in the early 1990s with the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

==Origin==
===Background===
Twenty-three-year-old Janko Matúška wrote the lyrics of &quot;Nad Tatrou sa blýska&quot; in January and February 1844. The tune came from the folk song &quot;Kopala studienku&quot; () suggested to him by his fellow student Jozef Podhradský, a future religious and Pan-Slavic activist and gymnasial teacher, when Matúška and about two dozen other students left their prestigious Lutheran lyceum of Pressburg (preparatory high school and college) in protest over the removal of Ľudovít Štúr from his teaching position by the Lutheran Church under pressure from the authorities. The territory of present-day Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary within the Austrian Empire then, and the officials objected to his Slovak nationalism.

&quot;Lightning over the Tatras&quot; was written during the weeks when the students were agitated about the repeated denials of their and others&#x27; appeals to the school board to reverse Štúr&#x27;s dismissal. About a dozen of the defecting students transferred to the Lutheran gymnasium of Levoča. When one of the students, the 18-year-old budding journalist and writer Viliam Pauliny-Tóth, wrote down the oldest known record of the poem in his school notebook in 1844, he gave it the title of &quot;Prešporskí Slováci, budúci Levočania&quot; (Pressburg Slovaks, Future Levočians), which reflected the motivation of its origin.

The journey from Pressburg (present-day Bratislava) to Levoča took the students past the High Tatras, Slovakia&#x27;s and the then Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s highest, imposing, and symbolic mountain range. A storm above the mountains is a key theme in the poem.

===Versions===
No authorized version of Matúška&#x27;s lyrics has been preserved and its early records remained without attribution. He stopped publishing after 1849 and later became clerk of the district court. The song became popular during the Slovak Volunteer campaigns of 1848 and 1849. Its text was copied and recopied in hand before it appeared in print in 1851 (unattributed, as &quot;Dobrovoľnícka&quot; – Volunteer Song), which gave rise to some variation, namely concerning the phrase &quot;zastavme ich&quot; (&quot;let&#x27;s stop them&quot;) or &quot;zastavme sa&quot; (&quot;let&#x27;s stop&quot;). A review of the extant copies and related literature inferred that Matúška&#x27;s original was most likely to have contained &quot;let&#x27;s stop them.&quot; Among other documents, it occurred both in its oldest preserved handwritten record from 1844 and in its first printed version from 1851. The legislated Slovak national anthem uses this version, the other phrase was used from 1920 to 1993 (as the second part of the anthem of Czechoslovakia with Kde domov můj).

On January 1, 2025 at midnight, the public broadcaster Slovak Television and Radio first introduced the a partially revised version of its national anthem. This updated rendition features a modernized melody and a slightly slower tempo. Notably, the new arrangement includes the sound of the fujara, a traditional Slovak folk instrument, in the final seconds of the melody. The arrangement was overseen by Oskar Rózsa and his musical assembly. Public opinion on the change remains divided. While some have welcomed the modernization of the anthem, others question the necessity and quality of the revision as well as the procedural aspects of the change. Critics pointed out that the revision of national anthem should have taken place through an open competition and not assigned directly to Rózsa, who has embraced extreme right-wing talking points and conspiracy theories held by the culture minister Martina Šimkovičová and her head of cabinet Lukáš Machala. Additionally, the comments by Rózsa, who in response to criticism claimed his version of the anthem was not for liberals, who should &quot;crawl into their holes&quot; as their time in Slovakia was ending were met with widespread condemnation. Additionally, the new version of the anthem was poorly received by critics who labeled it a &quot;kitch&quot; and &quot;sad funeral music&quot;. Finally, critics argue that the cost of revision, which amounted to approximately €50,000, was too large and that these funds could have been better allocated to sectors such as education or healthcare.

==National anthem==
On 13 December 1918, only the first stanza of Janko Matúška&#x27;s lyrics became half of the two-part bilingual Czechoslovak anthem, composed of the first stanza from a Czech operetta tune, &quot;Kde domov můj&quot; (Where Is My Home?), and the first stanza of Matúška&#x27;s song, each sung in its respective language and both played in that sequence with their respective tunes. The songs reflected the two nations&#x27; concerns in the 19th century when they were confronted with the already fervent national-ethnic activism of the Hungarians and the Germans, their fellow ethnic groups in the Habsburg monarchy.

During the Second World War, &quot;Hej, Slováci&quot; was adopted as the unofficial state anthem of the puppet regime Slovak Republic.

When Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 1993, the second stanza was added to the first and the result legislated as Slovakia&#x27;s national anthem.

==Lyrics==
Only the first two stanzas have been legislated as the national anthem.


===Poetics===

One of the trends shared by many Slovak Romantic poets was frequent versification that imitated the patterns of the local folk songs. The additional impetus for Janko Matúška to embrace the trend in &quot;Lightning over the Tatras&quot; was that he actually designed it to replace the lyrics of an existing folk song. Among the Romantic-folkloric features in the structure of &quot;Lightning over the Tatras&quot; are the equal number of syllables per verse, and the consistent a−b−b−a disyllabic rhyming of verses 2-5 in each stanza. Leaving the first verses unrhymed was Matúška&#x27;s license (a single matching sound, &quot;blýska—bratia&quot;, did not qualify as a rhyme):

:— Nad Tatrou sa blýska
:a - Hromy divo bijú
:b - Zastavme ich bratia
:b - Veď sa ony stratia
:a - Slováci ožijú

Another traditional arrangement of Matúška&#x27;s lines gives 4-verse stanzas rhymed a−b−b−a with the first verse made up of 12 syllables split by a mid-pause, and each of the remaining 3 verses made up of 6 syllables:
:a - Nad Tatrou sa blýska, hromy divo bijú
:b - Zastavme ich bratia
:b - Veď sa ony stratia
:a - Slováci ožijú

<text>Wallpaper is used in interior decoration to cover the interior walls of domestic and public buildings. It is usually sold in rolls and is applied onto a wall using wallpaper paste. Wallpapers can come plain as &quot;lining paper&quot; to help cover uneven surfaces and minor wall defects, &quot;textured&quot;, plain with a regular repeating pattern design, or with a single non-repeating large design carried over a set of sheets.

The smallest wallpaper rectangle that can be tiled to form the whole pattern is known as the pattern repeat. Wallpaper printing techniques include surface printing, rotogravure, screen-printing, rotary printing press, and digital printing.

== Modern wallpaper ==
Modern wallpaper is made in long rolls which are hung vertically on a wall. Patterned wallpapers are designed so that the pattern &quot;repeats&quot;, and thus pieces cut from the same roll can be hung next to each other so as to continue the pattern without it being easy to see where the join between two pieces occurs. In the case of large complex patterns of images this is normally achieved by starting the second piece halfway into the length of the repeat, so that if the pattern going down the roll repeats after , the next piece sideways is cut from the roll to begin down the pattern from the first. The number of times the pattern repeats horizontally across a roll does not matter for this purpose. A single pattern can be issued in several different colorways.

== History ==
The main historical techniques are hand-painting, woodblock printing (overall the most common), stencilling, and various types of machine printing. The first three all date back to before 1700.

Wallpaper, using the printmaking technique of woodcut, gained popularity in Renaissance Europe amongst the emerging gentry. The social elite continued to hang large tapestries on the walls of their homes, as they had in the Middle Ages. These tapestries added color to the room as well as providing an insulating layer between the stone walls and the room, thus retaining heat in the room. However, tapestries were extremely expensive and so only the very rich could afford them. Less well-off members of the elite, unable to buy tapestries due either to prices or wars preventing international trade, turned to wallpaper to brighten up their rooms.

Early wallpaper featured scenes similar to those depicted on tapestries, and large sheets of the paper were sometimes hung loosely on the walls, in the style of tapestries, and sometimes pasted as today. Prints were very often pasted to walls, instead of being framed and hung, and the largest sizes of prints, which came in several sheets, were probably mainly intended to be pasted to walls. Some important artists made such pieces – notably Albrecht Dürer, who worked on both large picture prints and also ornament prints – intended for wall-hanging. The largest picture print was &quot;The Triumphal Arch&quot; commissioned by the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and completed in 1515. This measured a colossal , made up of 192 sheets, and was printed in a first edition of 700 copies, intended to be hung in palaces and, in particular, town halls, after hand-coloring.

Very few samples of the earliest repeating pattern wallpapers survive, but there are a large number of old master prints, often in engraving of repeating or repeatable decorative patterns. These are called ornament prints and were intended as models for wallpaper makers, among other uses.

England and France were leaders in European wallpaper manufacturing. Among the earliest known samples is one found on a wall from England and is printed on the back of a London proclamation of 1509. It became very popular in England following Henry VIII&#x27;s excommunication from the Catholic Church – English aristocrats had always imported tapestries from Flanders and Arras, but Henry VIII&#x27;s split with the Catholic Church had resulted in a fall in trade with Europe. Without any tapestry manufacturers in England, English gentry and aristocracy alike turned to wallpaper.

During the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, the manufacture of wallpaper, seen as a frivolous item by the Puritan government, was halted. Following the Restoration of Charles II, wealthy people across England began demanding wallpaper again – Cromwell&#x27;s Puritan regime had imposed a repressive and restrictive culture on the population, and following his death, wealthy people began purchasing comfortable domestic items which had been banned under the Puritan state.

=== 18th century ===
In 1712, during the reign of Queen Anne, a wallpaper tax was introduced which was not abolished until 1836. By the mid-18th century, Britain was the leading wallpaper manufacturer in Europe, exporting vast quantities to Europe in addition to selling on the middle-class British market. However this trade was seriously disrupted in 1755 by the Seven Years&#x27; War and later the Napoleonic Wars, and by a heavy level of duty on imports to France.

In 1748 the British Ambassador to Paris decorated his salon with blue flock wallpaper, which then became very fashionable there. In the 1760s the French manufacturer Jean-Baptiste Réveillon hired designers working in silk and tapestry to produce some of the most subtle and luxurious wallpaper ever made. His sky blue wallpaper with fleurs-de-lys was used in 1783 on the first balloons by the Montgolfier brothers. The landscape painter Jean-Baptiste Pillement discovered in 1763 a method to use fast colours.

Hand-blocked wallpapers like these use hand-carved blocks and by the 18th century designs include panoramic views of antique architecture, exotic landscapes and pastoral subjects, as well as repeating patterns of stylized flowers, people and animals.

In 1785 Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf had invented the first machine for printing coloured tints on sheets of wallpaper. In 1799 Louis-Nicolas Robert patented a machine to produce continuous lengths of paper, the forerunner of the Fourdrinier machine. This ability to produce continuous lengths of wallpaper now offered the prospect of novel designs and nice tints being widely displayed in drawing rooms across Europe.

Wallpaper manufacturers active in England in the 18th century included John Baptist Jackson and John Sherringham. Among the firms established in 18th-century America: J. F. Bumstead &amp; Co. (Boston), William Poyntell (Philadelphia), John Rugar (New York).

High-quality wallpaper made in China became available from the later part of the 17th century; this was entirely handpainted and very expensive. It can still be seen in rooms in palaces and grand houses including Nymphenburg Palace, Łazienki Palace, Chatsworth House, Temple Newsam, Broughton Castle, Lissan House, and Erddig. It was made up to wide. English, French and German manufacturers imitated it, usually beginning with a printed outline which was coloured in by hand, a technique sometimes also used in later Chinese papers.

=== France and America ===
Towards the end of the 18th century the fashion for scenic wallpaper revived in both America and France, leading to some enormous panoramas, like the 1804 20 strip wide panorama, (Savages of the Pacific), designed by the artist Jean-Gabriel Charvet for the French manufacturer Joseph Dufour et Cie showing the Voyages of Captain Cook. This famous so-called &quot;papier peint&quot; wallpaper is still in situ in Ham House, Peabody, Massachusetts. It was the largest panoramic wallpaper of its time, and marked the burgeoning of a French industry in panoramic wallpapers. Dufour realized almost immediate success from the sale of these papers and enjoyed a lively trade with America. The Neoclassical style currently in favour worked well in houses of the Federal period with Charvet&#x27;s elegant designs. Like most 18th-century wallpapers, the panorama was designed to be hung above a dado.

Beside Joseph Dufour et Cie (1797 – ) other French manufacturers of panoramic scenic and wallpapers, Zuber et Cie (1797–present) and Arthur et Robert exported their product across Europe and North America. Zuber et Cie&#x27;s design &quot;Views of North America&quot; hangs in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House.

Among the firms begun in France in the 19th century: Desfossé &amp; Karth. In the United States: John Bellrose, Blanchard &amp; Curry, Howell Brothers, Longstreth &amp; Sons, Isaac Pugh in Philadelphia; Bigelow, Hayden &amp; Co. in Massachusetts; Christy &amp; Constant, A. Harwood, R. Prince in New York.

The earliest known American wallpaper sample book that has survived to present day resides in the collection of Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. It was produced by the firm Janes &amp; Bolles of Hartford, Connecticut, between 1821 and 1828.

=== England ===
During the Napoleonic Wars, trade between Europe and Britain evaporated, resulting in the gradual decline of the wallpaper industry in Britain. However, the end of the war saw a massive demand in Europe for British goods which had been inaccessible during the wars, including cheap, colourful wallpaper. The development of steam-powered printing presses in Britain in 1813 allowed manufacturers to mass-produce wallpaper, reducing its price and so making it affordable to working-class people. Wallpaper enjoyed a huge boom in popularity in the nineteenth century, seen as a cheap and very effective way of brightening up cramped and dark rooms in working-class areas. It became almost the norm in most areas of middle-class homes, but remained relatively little used in public buildings and offices, with patterns generally being avoided in such locations. In the latter half of the century Lincrusta and Anaglypta, not strictly wallpapers, became popular competitors, especially below a dado rail. They could be painted and washed, and were a good deal tougher, though also more expensive.

Wallpaper manufacturing firms established in England in the 19th century included Jeffrey &amp; Co.; Shand Kydd Ltd.; Lightbown, Aspinall &amp; Co.; John Line &amp; Sons; Potter &amp; Co.; Arthur Sanderson &amp; Sons; Townshend &amp; Parker. Designers included Owen Jones, William Morris, and Charles Voysey. In particular, many 19th century designs by Morris &amp; Co and other Arts and Crafts Movement designers remain in production.

=== 20th century ===
By the early 20th century wallpaper had established itself as one of the most popular household items across the Western world. Manufacturers in the USA included Sears; designers included Andy Warhol. Wallpaper has gone in and out of fashion since about 1930, but the overall trend has been for wallpaper-type patterned wallcoverings to lose ground to plain painted walls.

=== 21st century ===
In the early 21st century wallpaper evolved into a lighting feature, enhancing the mood and the ambience through lights and crystals. Meystyle, a London-based company, invented LED-incorporated wallpaper. The development of digital printing allows designers to break the mould and combine new technology and art to bring wallpaper to a new level of popularity.

== Historical collections ==
Historical examples of wallpaper are preserved by cultural institutions such as the Deutsches Tapetenmuseum (Kassel) in Germany; the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (Paris) and Musée du Papier Peint (Rixheim) in France; the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) in the UK; the Smithsonian&#x27;s Cooper-Hewitt, Historic New England, Metropolitan Museum of Art, U.S. National Park Service, and Winterthur in the US. Original designs by William Morris and other English wallpaper companies are held by Walker Greenbank.

== Types and sizes ==

In terms of methods of creation, wallpaper types include painted wallpaper, hand-printed blockwood wallpaper, hand-printed stencil wallpaper, machine-printed wallpaper, and flock wallpaper.

Modern wallcoverings are diverse, and what is described as wallpaper may no longer actually be made from paper. Two of the most common factory trimmed sizes of wallpaper are referred to as &quot;American&quot; and &quot;European&quot; rolled goods. American rolled goods are by in length. European rolled goods are wide by in length, approximately . Most wallpaper borders are sold by length and with a wide range of widths therefore surface area is not applicable, although some may require trimming.

The most common wall covering for residential use and generally the most economical is prepasted vinyl coated paper, commonly called &quot;strippable&quot; which can be misleading. Cloth backed vinyl is fairly common and durable. Lighter vinyls are easier to handle and hang. Paper backed vinyls are generally more expensive, significantly more difficult to hang, and can be found in wider untrimmed widths. Foil wallpaper generally has paper backing and can (exceptionally) be up to wide, and be very difficult to handle and hang. Textile wallpapers include silks, linens, grass cloths, strings, rattan, and actual impressed leaves. There are acoustical wall carpets to reduce sound. Customized wallcoverings are available at high prices and most often have minimum roll orders.

Solid vinyl with a cloth backing is the most common commercial wallcovering and comes from the factory as untrimmed at approximately, to be overlapped and double cut by the installer. This same type can be pre-trimmed at the factory to approximately.

== Modern developments ==
=== Custom printing ===
New digital inkjet printing technologies using ultraviolet (UV) cured inks are being used for custom wallpaper production. Very small runs can be made, even a single wall. Photographs or digital art are output onto blank wallpaper material. Typical installations are corporate lobbies, restaurants, athletic facilities, and home interiors. This gives a designer the ability to give a space the exact look and feel desired.

=== High-tech ===
New types of wallpaper under development or entering the market in the early 21st century include wallpaper that blocks certain mobile phone and WiFi signals, in the interest of privacy. The wallpaper is coated with a silver ink which forms crystals that block outgoing signals.

=== Seismic ===
In 2012 scientists at the Institute of Solid Construction and Construction Material Technology at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology announced that they had developed a wallpaper that can help keep a masonry wall from failing in an earthquake. The wallpaper uses glass fibre reinforcement in several directions and a special adhesive which forms a strong bond with the masonry when dry.

=== As a means of artistic expression ===
Tsang Kin-Wah, one of Hong Kong&#x27;s best-known painters, creates large-scale wallpaper installations that evoke the floral designs of William Morris in a style that has become known as word-art installation.

== Installation ==
Like paint, wallpaper requires proper surface preparation before application. Additionally wallpaper is not suitable for all areas. For example, bathroom wallpaper may deteriorate rapidly due to excessive steam (if is not sealed with a specific varnish). Proper preparation includes the repair of any defects in the drywall or plaster and the removal of loose material or old adhesives. For a better finish with thinner papers and poorer quality walls the wall can be cross-lined (horizontally) with lining paper first. Accurate room measurements (length, width, and height) along with number of window and door openings is essential for ordering wallpaper. Large drops, or repeats, in a pattern can be cut and hung more economically by working from alternating rolls of paper.

After pre-pasted wallpaper is moistened, or dry wallpaper is coated with wet paste, the wet surface is folded onto itself and left for a few minutes to activate the glue, which is called &quot;booking wallpaper.&quot;

Besides conventional installation on interior walls and ceilings, wallpapers have been deployed as decorative covering for hatboxes, bandboxes, books, shelves, and window-shades.

===Wallpaper adhesives===

Most wallpaper adhesives are starch or methylcellulose based.

<text>Albert W. Hall (born November 10, 1937) is an American retired actor. He portrayed Chief Phillips in the 1979 war film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and Judge Seymore Walsh in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and &quot;The Practice&quot;. He also played Brother Baines in the 1992 Spike Lee film &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. His last screen role was a 2011 episode of the television series &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hall was born and raised in Brighton, Alabama. He graduated from the Columbia University School of the Arts.

==Career==

===Early work===
After portraying Pointer in &quot;Willie Dynamite&quot; (1974), Hall had a part in the 1976 biopic &quot;Leadbelly&quot;. He played a co-pilot in the 1978 film &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot;. Hall had a small role in the 1979 miniseries &quot;&quot;.

===&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;===
Hall gained mainstream attention for his role as Chief Phillips in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1979 war classic &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, in which his character, as a Chief Petty Officer, leads the rest of a United States Navy PBR (Patrol Boat, River) crew upriver from Vietnam to Cambodia so that Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) can complete his mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). To prepare for the role, Hall did research to accurately portray someone experiencing the Vietnam War first hand. The actor described filming in the Philippines as &quot;exotic&quot; and added that &quot;it was all fun.&quot;

When Hall&#x27;s &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; (1991) co-star Jeffrey Wright told him that &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; is his favorite film, he gave him a book in which he wrote inside, &quot;Jeffrey, evolution is when a young actor comes up to you and says, &#x27;I&#x27;ve seen your work, you know, a hundred so times, and it has meaning to me.&#x27;&quot;

According to &quot;Slate&quot;, some of Hall&#x27;s dialogue in &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot; is semi-improvised. Hall&#x27;s performance in both versions has been praised by the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; respectively.

===Later work===
Hall appeared in the 1981 miniseries &quot;The Sophisticated Gents&quot;. In 1983, Hall had his first regular role in the short-lived series &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Four&quot;. Hall also appeared alongside Sidney Poitier in the 1991 television movie &quot;Separate but Equal&quot;.

Throughout the 1990s, Hall appeared in a range of films, starting with memorable performances in &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992) and &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (1993). He collaborated with Spike Lee, the director of the former film, again in &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (1996). Other films Hall appeared in during that decade include &quot;Major Payne&quot; (1995), &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot; (1995), &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996) and &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998).

In the late 1990s, Hall became known by television audiences for his recurring role as Judge Seymore Walsh in the series &quot;The Practice&quot; and &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, both of which were created by David E. Kelley. Coincidentally, he portrayed the role of a judge in soap operas such as &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

Hall has portrayed real life figures such as Hank Aaron in the 1998 television film &quot;The Tiger Woods Story&quot; and Elijah Muhammad in Michael Mann&#x27;s 2001 biopic &quot;Ali&quot;. Hall played the recurring role of Bruce in the series &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;.

<doc id="253958" wikidata="Q212890" url="?curid=253958" title="Denis of Portugal">
<text>Denis (, , ; 9 October 1261 – 7 January 1325), called the Farmer King (&quot;Rei Lavrador&quot;) and the Poet King (&quot;Rei Poeta&quot;), was King of Portugal. The eldest son of Afonso III of Portugal by his second wife, Beatrice of Castile, and grandson of Afonso II of Portugal, Denis succeeded his father in 1279. He was married to Elizabeth of Aragon, who was later canonised as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church.

Denis ruled Portugal for over 46 years. He worked to reorganise his country&#x27;s economy and gave an impetus to Portuguese agriculture. He ordered the planting of a large pine forest (that still exists today) near Leiria to prevent the soil degradation that threatened the region and to serve as a source of raw materials for the construction of the royal ships. He was also known for his poetry, which constitutes an important contribution to the development of Portuguese as a literary language.

==Reign==

In 1290, Denis began to pursue the systematic centralisation of royal power by imposing judicial reforms, decreeing Portuguese &quot;the official language of legal and judicial proceedings&quot;, creating the first university in Portugal, and ridding the military orders in the country of foreign influences. His policies encouraged economic development with the creation of numerous towns and trade fairs. He advanced the interests of the Portuguese merchants, and set up by mutual agreement a fund called the &quot;Bolsa de Comércio&quot;, the first documented form of marine insurance in Europe, approved on 10 May 1293. Always concerned with development of the country&#x27;s infrastructure, he encouraged the discovery and exploitation of sulphur, silver, tin and iron mines and organised the export of excess production of agricultural crops, salt, and salted fish to England, Flanders, and France.

Denis signed the first Portuguese commercial agreement with England in 1308, and secured a contract in 1317 for the services of the Genoese merchant sailor Manuel Pessanha (Portuguese form of the Italian &quot;Pezagno&quot;) as hereditary admiral of his fleet, with the understanding that Pessanha and his successors should provide twenty Genoese captains to command the king&#x27;s galleys, thus effectively founding the Portuguese Navy.

In 1289 Denis had signed the Concordat of Forty Articles with Pope Nicholas IV, swearing to protect the Church&#x27;s interests in Portugal. When Pope Clement V allowed the annihilation of the Knights Templar throughout most of Europe on charges of heresy, Denis created in 1319 a Portuguese military order, the Order of Christ, for those knights who survived the purge. The new order was designed to be a continuation of the Order of the Temple. Denis negotiated with Clement&#x27;s successor, John XXII, for recognition of the new order and its right to inherit the Templar assets and property.

==Cultural pursuits==
During Denis&#x27; reign, Lisbon became one of Europe&#x27;s centres of culture and learning. The first university in Portugal, then called the &quot;Estudo Geral&quot; (General Study), was founded with his signing of the document &quot;Scientiae thesaurus mirabilis&quot; in Leiria on 3 March 1290. Lectures in the arts, civil law, canon law, and medicine were given, and on 15 February 1309, the king granted the university a charter, the &quot;Magna Charta Privilegiorum&quot;. The university was moved between Lisbon and Coimbra several times, and finally installed permanently in Coimbra in 1537 by order of King John III.

As a devotee of the arts and sciences, Denis studied literature and wrote several books on topics ranging from government administration to hunting, science and poetry, as well as ordering the translation of many literary works into Galician-Portuguese (Portuguese had not yet fully evolved into a distinct language), among them the works attributed to his grandfather Alfonso X. He patronised troubadours, and wrote lyric poetry in the troubadour tradition himself. His best-known work is the &quot;Cantigas de Amigo&quot;, a collection of love songs as well as satirical songs, which contributed to the development of troubador poetry in the Iberian Peninsula. All told, 137 of the songs attributed to him, in the three main genres of Galician-Portuguese lyric, are preserved in the two early 16th-century manuscripts, the &quot;Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional&quot; and the &quot;Cancioneiro da Vaticana&quot;. A spectacular find in 1990 by American scholar Harvey Sharrer brought to light the &quot;Pergaminho Sharrer&quot;, which contains, albeit in fragmentary form, seven &quot;cantigas d&#x27;amor&quot; by King Denis with musical notation. These poems are found in the same order in the two previously known codices.

King Denis was fond of hunting and in 1294 was hunting around Beja, when a bear attacked him and his horse, bringing them to the ground. It is said that he attacked the beast single-handedly and killed him with a dagger. To commemorate the incident, the king had a live bear captured and taken to his palace of Fuellas for the amusement of the gentlemen and ladies of his court.

==Administration==

As heir-apparent to the throne, Denis was summoned by his father Afonso III to share governmental responsibilities. The country was again in conflict with the Catholic Church at the time, Afonso having been excommunicated in 1277, and only being absolved in 1279 when he acceded to Rome&#x27;s demands on his deathbed. Consequently, the church was favorably inclined to reach an agreement with the new monarch upon his accession to the throne.

In 1284, however, Denis emulated the example of his grandfather and father, and launched a new series of inquiries to investigate the expropriation of royal property; this was to the detriment of the church. The next year he took further steps against ecclesiastical power when he promulgated amortisation laws. These prohibited the church and religious orders from buying lands, and required that they sell or forfeit any they had purchased since the start of his reign. Several years later he issued another decree forbidding them to inherit the estates of recruits to the orders.

In 1288, Denis managed to persuade Pope Nicholas IV to issue a papal bull that separated the Order of Santiago in Portugal from that in Castile, to which it had been subordinate. With the extinction of the Knights Templar, he was able to transfer their assets in the country to the Order of Christ, specially created for this purpose.

Denis was essentially an administrator and not a warrior king. He went to war with the kingdom of Castile in 1295, relinquishing the villages of Serpa and Moura. In 1297, he signed the Treaty of Alcañices with Castile, which defined the current borders between the two Iberian countries, and reaffirmed Portugal&#x27;s possession of the Algarve. The treaty also established an alliance of friendship and mutual defense, leading to a peace of 40 years between the two nations.

Denis pursued his father&#x27;s policies on legislation and centralisation of power, and promulgated the nucleus of a Portuguese civil and criminal law code, protecting the lower classes from abuse and extortion. These edicts survived in the &quot;Livro das Leis e Posturas&quot; (Book of Laws and Postures), and the &quot;Ordenações Afonsinas&quot; (Afonsine Ordinances), proclaimed during the reign of Afonso V. These are not legislative &quot;codes&quot; as we understand them today, but rather compilations of laws and customary municipal law, as amended and restated by the Portuguese crown.
As king, Denis travelled around the country to resolve various problems. He ordered the construction of numerous castles, created new towns, and granted the privileges due cities to several others. He declared in 1290 that &#x27;the language of the people&#x27; was to become the language of the state, and officially known as Portuguese. Denis also decreed that Portuguese replace Latin as the language of the law courts in his kingdom. His wife Elizabeth donated much of the large income generated by her lands and properties to charities, inspiring Denis to help improve the life of the poor and found several social institutions.

The frequent procedural issues that arose when he issued his decrees increasingly occupied Denis in his quest to frame the common law as being within the scope of the crown&#x27;s jurisdiction, and in exercising royal power in the realm. The restrictions he placed on the actions of &quot;alvazis&quot; (local council officials), judges, as well as proctors and advocates in the courts, show that a merely nominal power of the monarchy over all the inhabitants of the kingdom, as was typical in the Middle Ages, was not compatible with his effort to assert a royal prerogative to scrutinise legal procedures or moralise on the exercise of justice. The appointment of magistrates clearly marks the start of the process of the crown claiming territorial jurisdiction, thus expanding the royal domain, along with the growing importance of Lisbon as the nation&#x27;s de facto capital. The preference for Lisbon as a venue of the royal court was accentuated during Denis&#x27;s long reign. There was as yet no official capital of the country, but Lisbon&#x27;s location, as well as its advanced urban, economic and commercial development, made the city the most viable choice for a national centre of administration.

Its geographical situation between the ancient divisions of the country, i.e., the north and the south, enhanced Lisbon&#x27;s status as the most practical centre for an emergent united Portuguese nation, the south now receiving as much royal attention as the north and becoming the residence of the monarchy. Their different characters created a realm where the two regions complemented each other. The great manors were closer together in the north, and the vast dominions conquered from the Muslims in the south, as well as the large areas of unclaimed land there, expanded the domain of the crown, and much of the territory of the extreme south came under the control of the military orders.

Denis promoted development of the rural infrastructure, earning the nickname of &quot;the Farmer&quot; (&quot;o Lavrador&quot;). He redistributed land, founded agricultural schools to improve farming techniques, and took a personal interest in the expansion of exports. He set up regular markets in a number of towns and regulated their activities. One of his principal achievements was to protect agricultural lands from advancing coastal sands by ordering the planting of a pine forest near Leiria, which also provided a source of raw materials for construction of a naval fleet. This forest, known as the &quot;Pinhal de Leiria&quot; (Leiria Pinewood), still exists, and is an important conservation area.

==Later years and death==
The latter part of Denis&#x27; generally peaceful reign was nevertheless marked by internal conflicts. The contenders were his two sons: Afonso, the legitimate heir, and Afonso Sanches, his bastard son, who quarreled frequently among themselves for royal favour. At the time of Denis&#x27; death in 1325, he had placed Portugal on an equal footing with the other Iberian Kingdoms.

Afonso, born in Lisbon, was the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not Denis&#x27; favourite son, the old king preferring Afonso Sanches, his illegitimate son by Aldonça Rodrigues Talha. The notorious rivalry between the half brothers led to civil war several times. Elizabeth would serve as intermediary between her husband and Afonso during the civil war of 1322–1324.

&quot;Infante&quot; Afonso greatly resented the king, whom he accused of favouring Afonso Sanches. Denis had little popular support in the war because of the many privileges he had granted to the nobles in the last years of his reign, while the &quot;Infante&quot; had the support of the county&#x27;s cities; these circumstances were rooted in the longstanding conflict between the upper and lower classes of Portuguese society. Repulsed to the town of Alenquer, which supported the &quot;Infante&quot;, Denis was prevented from killing his son through the intervention of the Queen. As legend holds, in 1323, Elizabeth, mounted on a mule, positioned herself between the opposing armies on the field of the Battle of Alvalade in order to prevent the combat. Peace returned in 1324 when Afonso Sanches was sent into exile and the &quot;Infante&quot; swore loyalty to the king.
King Denis died on 7 January 1325 at Santarém, and was buried in the Monastery of Saint Denis in Odivelas, near Lisbon. Afonso then became king, whereupon he exiled his rival to Castile, and stripped him of all the lands and fiefdoms bestowed by their father. From Castile, Afonso Sanches orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown. After he failed several times to mount an invasion of Portugal, the brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by Afonso IV&#x27;s mother Queen Elizabeth.

==Appraisal of reign==
Bearing in mind the many centuries that separate Denis from the present, an impression of his personality can be gathered from the historical record: he was determined, even obstinate, in his attempts to systematically centralise the government and consolidate royal power. For example, he launched general inquiries (&quot;Inquirições gerais&quot;) at a remarkably accelerated pace to investigate land ownership and identify cases where abuses were committed.

Denis revealed early on his ability as an effective strategist in the pursuit of his goals, and as an innovator of proactive legislative policy. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that his administrative decisions were not made randomly or without consideration of his ideal of a well-governed nation. The wide range of his policies is indicated by a few examples: the concomitant creation of new towns and trade fairs, the fortification of the country&#x27;s borders and the increasing dependence of the military orders on the royal power. He was recognized as an intelligent, perceptive ruler with demonstrated success, both by contemporaries and by later historians.

Denis was not lacking in political skill. Being adroit in negotiation and a student of human nature, he knew how to go about &quot;opposing and appeasing alternately the secular and the ecclesiastical manorial interests. He confiscated the properties of the clergy, but made the concordat [of 1289] with the Portuguese bishops; he restricted the &quot;comedoria&quot; (victuals) rights of the monasteries, but replaced those rights with a fixed annual sum of money. His actions were sufficiently [statesmanlike, and his political position was strong] enough, for him to secure the confiscation laws and check the erosion of the state patrimony&quot;. As administration of the royal properties became more efficient and he became richer, Denis gained fame for his wealth, even being mentioned in Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; where he was called &quot;Dionysus Agricola,&quot; and described among those condemned by the Eagle, in the Sixth Sphere, though the exact reason for this condemnation is unknown.

Nevertheless, Denis is described in contemporary chronicles as a wise and able ruler. Although most of the legislative work of his reign focused on procedural juridical issues, the purpose of much of this new legislation was to avoid excessive delays and court costs and to prevent abuse by attorneys and prosecutors. The personal determination that allowed Denis to achieve so much in the political realm could sometimes harden into obstinacy and arrogance. He was described occasionally as cruel, especially in family relations, shown for example in the way he dealt with his legitimate son and rightful heir, Afonso (never his favourite), and his wife, Elizabeth, to whom he turned over the children born of his infidelities, leaving her the responsibility of their care and education.

An inescapable figure in the history of the Iberian Peninsula in the 13th and the beginning of the 14th centuries, Denis was first called &quot;father of his country&quot; (&quot;Pai da Pátria&quot;) by the historian Duarte Nunes de Leão in 1600.

== Physical description ==
The historical sources of King Denis&#x27;s time, as well as later authors, failed to provide any detailed physical description of the monarch. The information known comes from an accidental opening of his tomb during a restoration in 1938. It was discovered that the legend of a figure of towering height was not an accurate one as he was only about tall. Denis made his will when he was 61 and died at age 63. He apparently enjoyed excellent health throughout his life, as he traveled frequently, got involved in wars from an early age and at age 60 still hunted. He died with complete dentition, a rarity for the time, something that even today continues to be fairly unusual.

A distinctive feature of his physiognomy revealed by examination of the body was that his hair and beard were auburn. This is a curious fact, as he was the first of the Portuguese royal line up to that time to have that hair color. This genetic trait could have been passed on the maternal side, as his uncle Ferdinand, called &quot;La Cerda&quot;, or &quot;the bristly one&quot;, had red hair as well. Denis may have inherited the trait from Henry II of England, who was his ancestor on both the paternal and maternal sides, or even possibly from his maternal great-grandmother Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen, granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (&quot;barbarossa&quot; means &quot;red beard&quot; in Italian).

==Opening of the tomb==
In 2016, the tomb of the king was opened for the first time since 1938. Initially a restoration work, the tomb became the subject of research. A physiognomic report of the king is expected to be published in the future. Among other artefacts, the king&#x27;s sword was retrieved from the tomb; it was found to be in a good state of preservation, except that the point had broken off.

==Marriage and descendants==
Denis&#x27; only wife was Isabel or Elizabeth of Aragon, daughter of Peter III of Aragon and Constance of Sicily. They married in 1282 and had a son and a daughter. Like other monarchs of the time, he had several illegitimate children as well.

<doc id="253962" wikidata="Q294607" url="?curid=253962" title="Edward, King of Portugal">
<text>Edward ( ; 31 October 1391 – 9 September 1438), also called Edward the Philosopher King (&quot;Duarte o Rei-Filósofo&quot;) or the Eloquent (&quot;o Eloquente&quot;), was the King of Portugal from 1433 until his death. He was born in Viseu, the son of John I of Portugal and his wife, Philippa of Lancaster. Edward was the oldest member of the &quot;Illustrious Generation&quot; of accomplished royal children who contributed to the development of Portuguese civilization during the 15th century.

==Early life==
Edward was the second born male legitimate son of King John I. He became the heir to the throne after his brother Afonso died in 1400, aged 10.

Before he ascended to the throne, Edward always followed his father in the affairs of the kingdom. He was knighted in 1415 after the Portuguese capture of the city of Ceuta in North Africa, across from Gibraltar. He became king in 1433, when his father died of the plague.

As king, Edward soon showed interest in building internal political consensus. During his short reign of five years, he called the Portuguese Cortes (the national assembly) no less than five times to discuss the political affairs of his kingdom. He also followed the politics of his father concerning the maritime exploration of Africa. He encouraged and financed his famous brother, Henry the Navigator, who initiated many expeditions on the west coast of Africa. An expedition of Gil Eanes in 1434 first rounded Cape Bojador on the northwestern coast of Africa, leading the way for further exploration southward along the African coast.

==Colonial affairs==

The colony at Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury, and it was realised that without the city of Tangier, possession of Ceuta was worthless. After Ceuta was captured by the Portuguese, the camel caravans that were part of the overland trade routes began to use Tangier as their new destination. This deprived Ceuta of the materials and goods that made it an attractive market and a vibrant trading locale, and it became an isolated community.

In 1437, Edward&#x27;s brothers Henry and Ferdinand persuaded him to launch an attack on the Marinid sultanate of Morocco. The expedition was not unanimously supported and was undertaken against the advice of the Pope. Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra, and the Infante John were both against the initiative; they preferred to avoid conflict with the Marinid Sultan. Their instincts proved to be justified. The resulting Battle of Tangier, led by Henry, was a debacle. Failing to take the city in a series of assaults, the Portuguese siege camp was soon itself surrounded and starved into submission by a Moroccan relief army. In the resulting treaty, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested. Ferdinand, the youngest brother of Edward, was handed over to the Marinids as a hostage for the final handover of the city.

==Late life==
The debacle at Tangier dominated the final year of Edward&#x27;s life. Peter and John urged him to fulfill the treaty, yield Ceuta and secure Ferdinand&#x27;s release, whereas Henry (who had signed the treaty) urged him to renege on it. Caught in indecision, Edward assembled the Portuguese Cortes at Leiria in early 1438 for consultation. The Cortes refused to ratify the treaty, preferring to hang on to Ceuta and requesting that Edward find some other means of obtaining Ferdinand&#x27;s release.

Edward died late that summer, in Tomar, of the plague, like his father and mother (and her mother) before him. Popular lore suggested he died of heartbreak over the fate of his hapless brother; Ferdinand would remain in captivity in Fez until his own death in 1443.

==Legacy==

Edward&#x27;s premature death provoked a political crisis in Portugal. Leaving only a young son, Afonso, to inherit the throne, it was generally assumed that Edward&#x27;s brothers would take over the regency of the realm. But Edward&#x27;s will appointed his unpopular foreign wife, Eleanor of Aragon, as regent. A popular uprising followed, in which the burghers of the realm, assembled by John of Reguengos, acclaimed Peter of Coimbra as regent. But the nobles backed Eleanor&#x27;s claim, and threatened civil war. The regency crisis was defused by a complicated and tense power-sharing arrangement between Eleanor and Peter.

Another less political side of Edward&#x27;s personality is related to culture. A reflective and scholarly infante, he wrote the treatises &quot;O Leal Conselheiro&quot; (The Loyal Counsellor) and &quot;Livro Da Ensinança De Bem Cavalgar Toda Sela&quot; (&quot;Book of Teachings on Riding Well on Every Saddle&quot;) as well as several poems. He was in the process of revising the Portuguese law code when he died.

==Marriages and descendants==
Edward married Eleanor of Aragon, a daughter of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque, in 1428.

<text>Sebastian ( ; 20 January 1554 – 4 August 1578) was King of Portugal from 11 June 1557 to 4 August 1578 and the penultimate Portuguese monarch of the House of Aviz.

He was the son of João Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and his wife, Joanna of Austria. He was the grandson of King John III of Portugal and Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal. He disappeared (presumably killed in action) in the battle of Alcácer Quibir, against the Saadi Sultanate of Morocco. Sebastian I is often referred to as &quot;the Desired&quot; () or &quot;the Hidden&quot; (), as the Portuguese people longed for his return to end the decline of Portugal that began after his death. He is considered to be the Portuguese example of the King asleep in mountain legend as Portuguese tradition states his return, in a foggy dawn, in Portugal&#x27;s greatest hour of need.

==Early life==

Sebastian was born shortly after eight in the morning of 20 January 1554 (the feast of Saint Sebastian), and he was given the saint&#x27;s name in commemoration. The name Sebastian was highly unusual for members of any European royal family at the time.

===Accession as a minor===
Sebastian was born heir apparent to the throne of Portugal, since his birth occurred two weeks after the death of his father. Soon after his birth, his mother Joanna of Spain left her infant son to serve as regent of Spain for her father, Emperor Charles V. After his abdication in 1556, she served in the same capacity for her brother Philip II of Spain. Joanna remained in Spain until her death in 1573, never to see her son again.

Sebastian succeeded to the throne at the age of three, on the death of his paternal grandfather King John III. Since he was still a child, a regency was necessary. It was handled first by his paternal grandmother, Catherine of Austria, and then by his great-uncle, Cardinal Henry of Évora. This period saw the continued Portuguese colonial expansion in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, and Malacca, as well as the annexation of Macau in 1557.

Sebastian was a bright and lively boy. Contemporaries described him as fearless due to his great physical strength. Tall, slim, and blond, he was brought up by his grandmother Catherine. She was a domineering woman who exercised firm control over her grandson. Obedient as a child, he became obstinate and impulsive in later life.

===Education===

The young king grew up under the guidance and heavy influence of the Jesuits. Aleixo de Meneses, a military man of solid reputation and former tutor and guardian of Prince John, was appointed tutor to Sebastian. Other teachers included the priest Luís Gonçalves da Câmara and his assistant, the priest Amador Rebelo.

His upbringing made Sebastian extremely devout. He carried a copy of Thomas Aquinas on a belt at his waist and was constantly accompanied by two clerics of the Theatine Order who were intent on preserving the king&#x27;s innocence. As a child, Sebastian reportedly would react to visitors by running off into hiding with the monks until the visitors had gone.

===Marriage plans===
Sebastian died young and did not marry. However, he was involved in some proposed marriage alliances. In particular, the Queen dowager of France, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, nurtured a plan for a long time to marry her youngest daughter, Margaret of Valois, to Sebastian, a plan which was supported by Sebastian&#x27;s maternal uncle, King Philip II of Spain, on occasion.

Sebastian himself, however, put an end to that plan, declaring that he was unimpressed by the mild suppression of the Huguenot Protestants in France, and that he would not bind himself to the House of Valois until he had seen how the situation would develop. Later, he agreed — being persuaded by emissaries of the Pope — to marry Margaret in order to prevent her from marrying the Huguenot Henry of Navarre; by that time, however, the French king and his mother were already intent on Margaret marrying Henry. Sebastian&#x27;s proposal was rejected, and Margaret married Henry in 1572.

Sebastian was also offered his cousin Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of Emperor Maximilian II (Maximilian was Charles V&#x27;s nephew.). Sebastian himself made a proposal in 1577 to his first cousin Isabella Clara Eugenia, daughter of his maternal uncle Philip II of Spain.

==Later reign==

During Sebastian&#x27;s short personal reign, he strengthened ties with the Holy Roman Empire, England and France through diplomatic efforts. He also restructured much of the administrative, judicial and military life in his kingdom. In 1568, Sebastian created scholarships to assist students who wished to study medicine or pharmacy at the University of Coimbra.

That same year he rewarded indigenous Brazilians in Brazil who helped in the fight against the French. The chief of the Temiminós Tribe, Arariboia, was given lands near the Bay of Guanabara. In 1569, Sebastian ordered Duarte Nunes de Leão to compile all the laws and legal documents of the kingdom in a collection of &quot;Leis Extravagantes&quot; known as the &quot;Código Sebastiânico&quot; (Sebastian&#x27;s code).

During the great plague of Lisbon in 1569, Sebastian sent for doctors from Seville to help the Portuguese doctors fight the plague. He created two hospitals in Lisbon to take care of those afflicted with the disease.

In his concern for the widows and orphans of those killed by the plague, he created several &quot;Recolhimentos&quot; (shelters) known as the &quot;Recolhimento de Santa Marta&quot; (shelter of Santa Marta) and the &quot;Recolhimento dos Meninos&quot; (shelter of the children) and provided wet nurses to take care of the babies.

===Legal reforms===
Sebastian created laws for the military, the &quot;Lei das Armas&quot;, that would become a military organization model. Goa was attacked by a pan-Asian alliance in 1570 during the War of the League of the Indies, but the Portuguese were successful in repulsing the assault. Also in 1570, Sebastian ordered that the Brazilian Indians should not be used as slaves and ordered the release of those held in captivity.

In 1572, the poet Luís de Camões presented his masterpiece &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; and dedicated a poem to Sebastian that won him a royal pension. In 1573, he commissioned the construction of the Royal Basilica in Castro Verde as a tribute to the Battle of Ourique. In 1575 with the &quot;Carta de Lei de Almeirim&quot;, the king established a system of measures for solid and liquid products and also defined the role of public servants.

The &quot;Celeiros Comuns&quot; (Communal Granaries) were inaugurated in 1576 on Sebastian&#x27;s orders. These were lending institutions intended to help to poor farmers when farm production decreased, giving credit, lending seeds and commodities to the needy. They were allowed to pay back their debts with farm products when they recovered from losses.

The mathematician and cosmographer Pedro Nunes was appointed by Sebastian as a cosmography teacher for sea pilots. It was during Sebastian&#x27;s reign that Nunes wrote his &quot;Petri Nonii Salaciensis Opera&quot;.

In 1577, Sebastian&#x27;s ordinance &quot;Da nova ordem do juízo, sobre o abreviar das demandas, e execução dellas&quot; decreased the time for handling legal actions, regulated the action of lawyers, scribes and other court officials, and created fines for delays.

==Last projects==
After attaining his majority in 1568, Sebastian dreamed of a great crusade against the kingdom of Morocco, where over the preceding generation several Portuguese way stations on the route to India had been lost.

A Moroccan succession struggle gave him the opportunity, when Abu Abdallah Mohammed II Saadi lost his throne in 1576 and fled to Portugal. After arriving, he asked for King Sebastian&#x27;s assistance in defeating his Turkish-backed uncle and rival, Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi. 

During the Christmastide of 1577, Sebastian met with his uncle King Philip II of Spain at Guadalupe. Philip refused to be party to the crusade as he was negotiating a truce with the Ottoman Empire, though he promised a contingent of Spanish volunteers.

Despite his lack of a son and heir, King Sebastian embarked on his crusade in 1578. The Portuguese army of 17,000 men, including a significant number of foreign mercenaries hired from the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, Spain, and the Italian States, and almost all of the country&#x27;s nobility, sailed at the beginning of June from Lisbon. They visited Cádiz, where they expected to find Spanish volunteers who failed to appear, then crossed into Morocco.
===Disappearance and probable death in battle===
At Arzila, Sebastian joined his ally Abu Abdullah Mohammed II, who had around 6,000 Moorish soldiers and, against the advice of his commanders, marched into the interior. At the Battle of Alcácer Quibir (Battle of the Three Kings), the Portuguese army was routed by Abd Al-Malik at the head of more than 60,000 men.

Sebastian was almost certainly killed in battle. He was last seen riding headlong into the enemy lines. Whether his body was ever found is uncertain, but Philip II of Spain claimed to have received his remains from Morocco and buried them in the Jerónimos Monastery in Belém, Lisbon, after he ascended to the Portuguese throne in 1580. The body could not be identified as Sebastian&#x27;s, however, which left some people unconvinced of his death. Sebastian was succeeded as king by his great-uncle Henry, brother of his grandfather, King John III.

==Legend and legacy==

Throughout the centuries, the personality and legacy of Sebastian caused a multitude of appreciations to be produced, negative or positive, though seldom indifferent.
Timothy Coates wrote that:

Anthony R. Disney, one of the foremost recent scholars of Portuguese history in English commented on the other hand that:
===Pretenders===

After the defeat at Alcácer Quibir, many efforts were made to ransom imprisoned Portuguese soldiers in Morocco. Several soldiers returned to Portugal, which led many Portuguese to believe Sebastian had survived the battle and would return to claim his throne. This led to Sebastianism, the belief that Sebastian could return at any moment. Politically, there was a belief that Philip was not the rightful heir to the throne. Subsequently, imposter pretenders appeared in Portugal and Castile who fraudulently claimed to be the king. During the time of the Iberian Union, between 1580 and 1640, four different pretenders claimed to be the returned King Sebastian, including Gabriel de Espinosa. The last of these pretenders, who was in fact an Italian, was hanged in 1619, while another was obtained by the Spanish from Venice, tried, found guilty and hanged in 1603.

In the long term, many myths and legends about Sebastian appeared, the principal one being that he was a great Portuguese patriot, the &quot;sleeping king&quot; who would return to help Portugal in its darkest hour (similar to the Britons&#x27; King Arthur, the German Frederick Barbarossa or the Byzantine Constantine XI Palaeologus).

He came to be known by symbolic names: &quot;O Encoberto&quot; (&quot;The Shrouded One&quot;) who would return on a foggy morning to save Portugal, or as &quot;O Desejado&quot; (&quot;The Desired One&quot;). These legends were vigorously promoted through the massive circulation of popular rhymes (&quot;trovas&quot;) written by António Gonçalves de Bandarra. Even as late as the 19th century, &quot;Sebastianist&quot; peasants in the town of Canudos in the Brazilian sertão believed that the king would return to help them in their rebellion against the &quot;godless&quot; Brazilian republic.

Sebastian&#x27;s life was dramatised in 1843 in the opera &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot; by the Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti. Belgian playwright Paul Dresse also dramatised his life in the 1975 play &quot;Sébastien de Portugal ou le Capitaine de Dieu&quot;. The legend of Sebastian&#x27;s disappearance and alleged return is the basis for the popular song &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Legend of King Sebastian&quot;) by the Portuguese band Quarteto 1111 (1968).

===In Morocco===
Though defeated in battle, Sebastians reputation in Morocco remained a positive one for centuries, as a symbol of a high ideal of chivalry. While on an archeological journey through the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco in 1923, the renown Portuguese archeologist, heraldist, and geneologist Afonso de Dornellas was informed by the minister of finance El Hach Abd Selam Ben El Arbi Benuna that &quot;there were Portuguese here of such breadth that for many leagues in distance they were spoken of with respect and admiration by the Arabs. If there were ancestors of mine with names recorded in history as worthy warriors it&#x27;s because they fought those Portuguese&quot; and that &quot;for a king to leave his greatness, his life of luxury, of glamour and to embark en masse with his people to fight here for their faith&quot; had set a high example at a time when Morocco had just reunifed after a long period of violent internal conflict over petty disputes, though Benuna was surprised to learn that the Portuguese are unsure whether the bones in Belém are his. At Asilah, the governor Baxa Xerife Sid Mustafa Ben Raisun who received Dornellas commission stated that &quot;this is where Sebastian landed, the great king of the Portuguese and whom we still esteem today as though he was the best of our kings&quot;.

<text>Bethlehem of Galilee (, &quot;Beit Lehem HaGlilit&quot;; lit. &quot;the Galilean Bethlehem&quot;) or Bethlehem-in-the-Galilee is a moshav in northern Israel. Located in the Galilee near Kiryat Tivon, around 10 kilometres north-west of Nazareth and 30 kilometres east of Haifa, it falls under the jurisdiction of the Jezreel Valley Regional Council. As of it had a population of .

The modern moshav is located at the site of the ancient Israelite settlement known as Bethlehem of Zebulun or Betlehem Zoria(h). Due to its proximity to Nazareth, one historian believes that it is the Bethlehem where Jesus of Nazareth was born. Aviram Oshri, a senior archaeologist with the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), supports this claim, but other researchers at the same institution reject it. The town existed as a Christian settlement in the classic era and was populated during the Middle Ages. It was reestablished as a German Templer Colony in Palestine in the 19th century and turned into a Jewish moshav in 1948.

==History==
To distinguish the city from the city of Bethlehem near Jerusalem, it was initially known as &quot;Bethlehem of Zebulun&quot;, while the town near Jerusalem was called &quot;Bethlehem of Judea&quot;. In the Jerusalem Talmud it is referred to as &quot;Beth Lehem Zoria&quot;, as it was part of the kingdom of Tyre (&quot;Ṣūr&quot;) at the time. According to the Book of Judges, one of the so-called &quot;Minor Judges&quot; of early settlement Israel, Ibzan, came from Bethlehem and was buried there. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges suggests that the Bethlehem referred to in this passage is Bethlehem of Galilee &quot;rather than the more famous Bethlehem in the Tribe of Judah&quot;.

Until the late 19th century, and even the 1921 visit by Gustaf Dalman, the impressive remains of a church and a synagogue could be seen there. Archaeologist Ariel Berman discovered a chalk vessel industry from the Early Roman period as well as a huge wine press. This shows that it was a prosperous city, which is used as an argument in favour of identifying today&#x27;s Bethlehem-in-the-Galilee with biblical Bethlehem of Zebulon.

Due to its proximity to Nazareth, one historian believes that it is the Bethlehem where Jesus was born. Aviram Oshri, a senior archaeologist with the IAA, supports this claim, although others at this institution reject it.

Remains of large Byzantine-period buildings as well as pottery (4th–5th century) from the same period have been found here, together with walls and objects from the Umayyad, Abbasid (eighth century) and Mamluk periods (14th–15th centuries).

===Ottoman period===
====Arab village====
In 1517, the village was included in the Ottoman Empire, and in the 1596 tax-records it appeared as &quot;Bayt Lahm&quot;, located in the &quot;Nahiya&quot; of Tabariyya of the &quot;Liwa&quot; of Safad. The population was 27 households and two bachelors, all Muslim. They paid a tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, which included wheat, barley, cotton, vegetable and fruit gardens, occasional revenues, goats and beehives; a total of 1200 Akçe.

In 1859, the British consul Rogers stated that the population was 110, and the tillage at sixteen feddans.

In 1875 Victor Guérin visited and noted that Bethlehem was a small village, which had succeeded a town of the same name. He further noted the ruins of two buildings; one, completely destroyed, had been constructed of good cut stones; the entrance was at the south façade. He thought, from its orientation north and south, that it was a synagogue. The other building, which lay east and west, may have been a Christian church. On its site were seen a few shafts, four of which were still in situ and half covered up.

In 1882, the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as &quot;The ancient Bethlehem of Zebulon. A village principally built of adobe on high ground in the border of the wooded country. The nearest water is in &quot;Wady el Melek&quot;, on the north (Ras el &#x27;Ain), and at the springs near Muwarah on the south.&quot;

A population list from about 1887 showed that Kh. Beit Lahm had about 55 inhabitants, all Muslims.

====Templer village====
In 1906 Templers from the German Colony in Haifa established a colony in Galilee, naming it for the ancient city.

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British authorities, Bait Lam had a population of 224; 111 Christians and 113 Muslims. Of the Christians, 95 were Protestant and 16 were Greek Catholics (Melkites). This had increased slightly by the 1931 census to a population of 235; 135 Muslim, 99 Christians and 1 Jew, in a total of 51 inhabited houses.
In 1932 the Nazi Party gained its first two members in Palestine; Karl Ruff and Walter Aberle from the Templer colony in Haifa. In the course of the 1930s, Bethlehemites also joined the party, indicating the fading affinity to the Templers&#x27; original ideals. By August 1939, 17% of all German Christians in Palestine were members of the Nazi Party. After the Nazi takeover in Germany, all international schools of German language subsidized or fully financed by government funds were obliged to employ teachers aligned to the Nazi Party. In 1933, Templer functionaries appealed to Paul von Hindenburg and the Foreign Office not to use swastika symbols for German institutions in Palestine and voiced opposition to the boycott of German Jewish shops. Later, this opposition subsided. On 20 August 1939 the German government called on German Christians in Palestine to join the Wehrmacht and 350 men enlisted.

After the start of World War II, all Germans in Palestine were declared enemy aliens. The British authorities sent them to Sarona, Bethlehem (Galilee), Waldheim (today&#x27;s Allonei Abba) and Wilhelma. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, mostly young families with children, were deported to Australia, leaving those who were too old or sick. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men who had enlisted in the Wehrmacht, were released - via Turkey - to Germany for the purpose of family reunification.

In the 1945 statistics the population of &quot;Beit Lam&quot; consisted of 370 people; 210 Muslims and 160 Christians, and the total land area was 7,526 dunams according to an official land and population survey. 6 dunams of land were designated for citrus and bananas, 278 dunams for plantations and irrigable land, 4,796 for cereals, while 51 dunams were built-up areas.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released but the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany. In 1947, they were allowed to emigrate to Australia.

===Israel===
On 17 April 1948 the Haganah captured the village, and it was subsequently depopulated. By 14 May 1948, when Israel declared independence, only 50 Templers remained in the country. It was resettled by Jewish farmers, becoming a moshav. Much of the original Templer architecture survives, and is similar in style to the homes built by the Templers in other parts of the country, such as Sarona in Tel Aviv, Wilhelma (today Bnei Atarot) and the German colonies of Haifa and Jerusalem.

In recent years, tourism has replaced agriculture as the main economic branch. A dairy, an herb farm, restaurants and country-style accommodation are among the tourist-oriented businesses in the village today.

<doc id="253972" wikidata="Q222123" url="?curid=253972" title="Henry, King of Portugal">
<text>Henry ( ; 31 January 1512 – 31 January 1580), dubbed the Chaste () and the Cardinal-King (), was king of Portugal and an inquisitor and cardinal of the Catholic Church, who ruled Portugal between 1578 and 1580. As a clergyman, he was bound to celibacy, and as such, had no children to succeed him, and thus put an end to the reigning House of Aviz. His death led to the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 and ultimately to the 60-year Iberian Union that saw Portugal share a monarch with Habsburg Spain. The next independent monarch of Portugal would be John IV, who restored the throne after 60 years of Spanish rule.

==Life==
Born in Lisbon, Henry was the fifth son of King Manuel I of Portugal and Maria of Aragon.

===Cardinal===
As the younger brother of King John III of Portugal and a younger son in the Royal Family, Henry was not expected to succeed to the Portuguese throne. Early in his life, Henry took Holy Orders to promote Portuguese interests within the Catholic Church, then dominated by Spain. He rose rapidly through the Church hierarchy, becoming in quick succession Archbishop of Braga, Archbishop of Évora, and Grand Inquisitor before being made a cardinal on 16 December 1545, with the title of Santi Quattro Coronati. From 1564 to 1570 he was Archbishop of Lisbon. Henry, more than anyone, endeavoured to bring the Jesuits to Portugal to encourage their activity in the colonial empire.

===Reign===
Henry served as regent for his great-nephew King Sebastian, replacing his sister-in-law and Sebastian&#x27;s grandmother Queen dowager Catherine, following her resignation from the role in 1562. King Sebastian died without an heir in the disastrous Battle of Alcácer Quibir that took place in 1578, and the elderly cardinal was proclaimed king soon after. Henry sought to be released from his ecclesiastical vows so he could take a bride and pursue the continuation of the Aviz dynasty, but Pope Gregory XIII, not wanting to antagonize Philip II of Spain, did not grant him that release.

====Death and succession====
The Cardinal-King died in the Royal Palace of Almeirim, on his 68th birthday, without having appointed a successor, leaving only a regency to care for the kingdom. One of the closest dynastic claimants was King Philip II of Spain who, in June 1580, sent the Duke of Alba to claim Portugal by force. Lisbon soon fell, and Philip was elected king of Portugal at the Portuguese Cortes of Tomar in 1581— on the condition that the kingdom and its overseas territories would retain their autonomy.

<doc id="253977" wikidata="Q2306330" url="?curid=253977" title="Philip Wicksteed">
<text>Philip Henry Wicksteed (25 October 1844 – 18 March 1927) was an English scholar and Unitarian theologian known for his contributions to classics, medieval studies and economics. He was also a Georgist and literary critic.

==Family background==
Philip Henry Wicksteed was the son of Charles Wicksteed (1810–1885) and his wife Jane (1814–1902), and was named after his distant ancestor, Philip Henry (1631–1696), the Nonconformist clergyman and diarist.

His father was a clergyman within the same tradition of English Dissent. His mother was born into the Lupton family, a socially progressive, politically active dynasty of businessmen and traders, long established in Leeds, a city both prosperous and squalid with the rapid growth of the Industrial Revolution. In 1835 Wicksteed had taken up the ministry of the Unitarian place of worship, Mill Hill Chapel, right on the city&#x27;s central square, and two years later the couple married. In 1841 his sister Elizabeth married Jane&#x27;s brother Arthur (1819–1867), also a Unitarian minister; Uncle Arthur was, according to a family history, &quot;The Achilles of the Leeds Complete Suffrage Association&quot;, in other words, a tragic champion of the fight for universal suffrage; see Chartism and Henry Vincent for more on the CSA. One of their children, a first cousin to Philip, was the maverick MP and mining engineer Arnold Lupton. Jane was described as impractical but accomplished (sketching, painting, reciting poetry etc.) and both the Wicksteed siblings as &quot;Unitarians of vigorous mind and keen intelligence&quot;.

Philip was one of nine children, including Janet, who wrote, as Mrs Lewis, a memoir including her parents; (Joseph) Hartley, president of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers; and Charles, also an engineer. One of his nieces was Mary Cicely Wicksteed, who married the prominent Australian surgeon Sir Hibbert Alan Stephen Newton (1887–1949)

==Education==
Wicksteed was educated at University College London and Manchester New College, the seminary for nonconformist ministers. In 1867 he received his master&#x27;s degree with a gold medal in classics. Following his father into the Unitarian ministry that year, Wicksteed embarked on an extraordinarily broad range of scholarly and theological explorations.

His theological and ethical writings continued long after he left the pulpit (in 1897), and appear to have been a starting point for many of his other fields of scholarly inquiry. These included his interest in Dante, which not only produced a remarkable list of publications, but also built Wicksteed&#x27;s reputation as one of the foremost medievalists of his time. Inspired by his reading of Henry George&#x27;s 1879 book &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, Wicksteed&#x27;s theologically driven interest in the ethics of modern society, appear to have led him into his economic studies.

Perhaps it was just by circumstance that economics entered Wicksteed&#x27;s field of scholarly vision, as only one of a number of areas of his interest (to most of which he was committed for years before he began his economics) and in the middle of the fourth decade of his life. This led Joseph Schumpeter to remark that Wicksteed &quot;stood somewhat outside of the economics profession&quot;.

Yet, within a few years Wicksteed was to publish significant economic work of his own, carefully expounding on the theory he learned from William Stanley Jevons, and to become for many years a lecturer on economics for the University of London extension lectures (a kind of adult education program initiated in the 1870s to extend &quot;the teaching of the universities, to serve up some of the crumbs from the university tables, in a portable and nutritious form, for some of the multitude who had no chance of sitting there&quot;).

In 1894, Wicksteed published his celebrated &quot;An Essay on the Co-ordination of the Laws of Distribution&quot;, in which he sought to prove mathematically that a distributive system which rewarded factory owners according to marginal productivity would exhaust the total product produced. But it was his 1910 &quot;The Common Sense of Political Economy&quot; which most comprehensively presents Wicksteed&#x27;s economic system. The 1932 work by Lionel Robbins, &quot;An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science&quot;, picked up and developed his ideas.

==Personal life==

<text>Wichita State University (WSU) is a public research university in Wichita, Kansas, United States. It is governed by the Kansas Board of Regents. The university offers more than 60 undergraduate degree programs in more than 200 areas of study in nine colleges. The university&#x27;s graduate school offers more than 50 master&#x27;s degrees in more than 100 areas and a specialist in education degree and 13 doctoral degrees. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
The idea behind Wichita State University began in 1886. Rev Joseph Homer Parker founded a private women&#x27;s Congregational preparatory school which was supported mainly by Wichita&#x27;s Plymouth Congregational Church, Rev. Parker&#x27;s church. The school never opened its doors.

Called the &quot;Young Ladies College,&quot; &quot;Wichita Ladies College&quot; and &quot;Congregational Female College&quot; and founded during a boom in college and university creation, the private school was envisioned to admit women twelve years and older. In early 1887, the project&#x27;s leaders received a land parcel from the developers of the adjacent Fairmount Neighborhood and, in response, renamed their school Fairmount College. Envisioned to be the &quot;Vassar of the West,&quot; the streets of the neighboring residential areas were named after prominent women&#x27;s colleges including Vassar and Holyoke. The street names remain in 2023.

In 1892, a corporation bought the property and named the preparatory school Fairmount Institute. Also known as Fairmount Academy, this Congregational church prep school opened in September to boys and girls age 12 and above.

In 1895, on the same site, Fairmount College opened collegiate classes for men and women with funding by the Congregational Education Society. The society selected Dr. Nathan Jackson Morrison to be the president of the new college.

During the 1900s and 1910s, the school grew with structures including a men&#x27;s dormitory, Fiske Hall, begun in 1904 and dedicated June 1906, and a Carnegie library, built in 1908, occupied in January 1909 and dedicated in January 1910.

Fairmount trustees decided to phase out and eventually close the institute after the 1915 school year. For 20 years, students of the institute formed the nucleus of Fairmount College&#x27;s student body.

The school&#x27;s mascot, the &quot;wheatshockers,&quot; came about during a football game in 1906 and referred to the fact that many of the football players also shocked wheat during the harvest.

Amid growing financial troubles in the 1920s, the college&#x27;s supporters tried to get the city of Wichita to buy it in 1925, but failed. A second referendum passed in 1926, and that fall it became the Municipal University of Wichita (popularly known as &quot;Wichita University&quot; or &quot;WU&quot;). It was the first municipal university west of the Mississippi.

By the 1950s, university leaders and President Harry Corbin explored adding the institution to the State of Kansas Regents System along with the University of Kansas and Kansas State University. These two schools had powerful friends who did not feel that the University of Wichita was on par with the state&#x27;s two main universities. It took a concerted lobbying effort on the part of WU boosters to persuade the legislature and governor to agree to the change. On July 1, 1964, the school officially entered the state system of higher education as Wichita State University (WSU).

Located on campus is the original building of the first Pizza Hut. The original building was located at Kellogg and Bluff. An effort to move it out of the path of Kellogg expansion resulted in the building coming to Wichita State University in the 1980s. After three decades of being located near the campus water tower, the building underwent a second move. In 2017, the university moved it to its current location on the Innovation Campus.

== Campuses ==
The Main Campus is located at 1845 North Fairmount in northeast Wichita, is mostly bounded between the streets of 17th St N, 21st St N, Hillside St, Oliver Ave. The Hughes Metropolitan Complex and Advanced Education in General Dentistry buildings, located at the intersection of 29th St N and Oliver Ave, are considered part of the main campus. There are seven satellite campuses.

Since July 1, 2018, the Campus of Applied Sciences and Technology, also known as &quot;WSU Tech&quot; and formerly known as the Wichita Area Technical College, is located at 4004 N. Webb Road in Wichita.

==Academics==


The university comprises the following academic colleges and schools:
* College of Applied Studies (formerly College of Education)
* College of Engineering
* College of Fine Arts
* College of Health Professions
* Dorothy and Bill Cohen Honors College
* Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
* Graduate School
* College of Innovation and Design (Formerly Institute for Interdisciplinary Innovation) 
* W. Frank Barton School of Business

The Aerospace Engineering department was founded in 1928 and has longstanding collaborative relationships with Airbus North America, Boeing, Bombardier-Learjet, Cessna, Hawker Beechcraft, Spirit AeroSystems, and other Wichita aviation concerns. The department teaches in the areas of composites, structures, Engineering mechanics, computational Fluid dynamics, applied Aerodynamics, and Flight simulation. Students can readily do internships at the nearby airports and many airplane companies like Cessna, Learjet, etc.

The Wichita State University Libraries have holdings of more than 2 million volumes, over 350 electronic databases and more than 70,000 journal subscriptions. The University Libraries consist of the main Ablah Library, the McKinley Chemistry Library, the Thurlow Lieurance Music Library and University Libraries Special Collections and University Archives. The libraries are open to community users and serve as a regional United States Federal Government Documents Depository, a State of Kansas Government Documents Depository, and is the State of Kansas&#x27; only Patents and Trademarks Library. WSU Special Collections and University Archives contains numerous rare books, incunabula, historical manuscripts collections, maps and photographic archives documenting Kansas history, as well as hosting the Wichita Photo Archives. The library faculty offer workshops throughout the year to students and community members.

==Innovation Campus==
In 2014, President John Bardo announced plans to launch a major academic and student life initiative, dubbed the &quot;Innovation Campus.&quot; The plan includes public/private partnerships with domestic and international companies that would build offices on the WSU main campus and collaborate with the students and faculty on research projects and product development through a technology transfer system. The plan kicked off with the completion of renovations to the university&#x27;s student union, the Rhatigan Student Center, and the opening of Shocker Hall, a new 318,000-square-foot, 784-bed housing facility on the main campus. Subsequent development has taken place on the site of the former Braeburn Golf Course, a WSU-owned course adjacent to campus which closed in November 2014. Ground broke on the first building, the Technology Transfer/Experiential Learning Building, in Q1 2015. The university has secured on-campus partnerships with multiple companies including Sunnyvale, Calif.-based NetApp, which moved its entire Wichita operations into a new building on campus; Airbus; Deloitte; Textron Aviation; Boston Consulting Group; and Dassault Systèmes to name a few. The Innovation Campus has added more than 15 buildings to campus, including Woolsey Hall, a new building for the Frank W. Barton School of Business; a new residence hall; commercial offices; &quot;creative collision&quot; facilities; two mixed-use developments and a hotel.

==Wichita Biomedical Campus==
In October 2022, President Richard Muma announced that Wichita State University, WSU Tech and the University of Kansas were moving forward with plans to build an approximately 470,000‑square‑foot, $300 million shared biomedical campus in the heart of downtown Wichita. The project, later dubbed the Wichita Biomedical Campus, would create a centrally located corridor where health care services, education, research and technology can be established near existing private hospitals and health care providers. In April 2023, the Kansas Legislature set aside $142 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 funds. Construction began in 2024.

===Fraternities and sororities===
There are various recognized fraternities and sororities at the university.

==Athletics==

The Wichita State (WSU) athletic teams are called the Shockers. The university is a member of the NCAA Division I ranks, primarily competing in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) since the 2017–18 academic year. The Shockers previously competed in the D-I Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) from 1945–46 to 2016–17; as an Independent from 1940–41 to 1944–45; in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (CIC) from 1923–24 to 1939–40; and in the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1902–03 to 1922–23.

WSU competes in 16 intercollegiate athletic teams: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Also, it offers club sports such as crew, bowling, shooting sports, and other intramural sports.

===Shockers===
The name for WSU&#x27;s athletic teams is the Shockers and students are also collectively referred to as &quot;Shockers.&quot; The name reflects the university&#x27;s heritage: Early students earned money by shocking, or harvesting, wheat in nearby fields. Early football games were played on a stubbled wheat field. Pep club members were known as Wheaties. Tradition has it that in 1904, football manager and student R.J. Kirk came up with the nickname Wheatshockers. Although the Wheatshockers name was never officially adopted by the university, it caught on and survived until it was later shortened to Shockers. Until 1948, the university used a nameless shock of wheat as its symbol. WuShock came to life when junior Wilbur Elsea won the Kappa Pi honorary society&#x27;s competition to design a mascot typifying the spirit of the school. The October 7, 1948, issue of &quot;The Sunflower&quot;, the student newspaper, ran an advertisement urging students to submit names for the school&#x27;s new mascot. The winning name was &quot;WuShock.&quot;

During the 1980s, WuShock briefly had a sidekick named WeeShock, that was introduced as an attempt to make the mascot more appealing to children.

In 1998, WuShock, also referred to as &quot;Wu,&quot; marked his 50th birthday by undergoing a redesign and getting a pumped-up physique and revved-up attitude. The mascot&#x27;s costume has changed over the years, as well. With the redesign, a new costume was introduced in fall 1998. In fall 1999, the head of the new costume underwent another redesign after a number of supporters suggested the mascot needed a more intimidating look. In 2006 it was decided to once again update the Wu costume. The general consensus was that many wanted the costume to more accurately reflect the depiction of WU in the school&#x27;s logo. The new WuShock now has the ability to run, jump, and walk up stairs without help. Many officials feel that a more professional and intimidating mascot on the field will certainly bolster WSU&#x27;s image.

===Basketball===
The men&#x27;s basketball team has played in the NCAA tournament 16 times since 1954, advancing to the Final Four in 1965 and 2013, the Elite Eight in 1981, and the Sweet Sixteen in 2006 and 2015, and also entering the 2014 NCAA tournament unbeaten. The team also won the 2011 National Invitation Tournament Championship, beating the Alabama Crimson Tide. The Shockers have three alumni currently playing in the NBA in Fred VanVleet, Landry Shamet and Craig Porter Jr. Other Wichita State products who have played in the league include All-Star Xavier McDaniel, power forwards Antoine Carr, Cliff Levingston, Cleanthony Early, two-time All-American Dave Stallworth, centers Gene Wiley and Jaime Echenique, guards Gal Mekel, Toure&#x27; Murry, Ron Baker, and Greg Dreiling. Four-time All-American Cleo Littleton joined the Shocks in 1951, breaking the unofficial color barrier in the Missouri Valley Conference.

===Baseball===
The men&#x27;s baseball team is college baseball&#x27;s highest winning team for the past 31 years, with numerous conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances. The baseball team won the national championship in 1989 and was runner-up in 1982, 1991 and 1993. They play at Eck Stadium.

===Bowling===
The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bowling teams have won 23 combined USBC Intercollegiate Team Championships, including the men&#x27;s 2003, 2008, 2009 and 2010 title and the women&#x27;s 2005, 2007 and 2009 title. The women&#x27;s team became an NCAA sport for the 2024-25 season.

===Football===
In 1897, Fairmount College played its first football game. In 1905, the Coleman Company set up gas-powered lighting for a night game against Cooper College (now Sterling College), which became the first night football game played west of the Mississippi River. In 1905, there was an experimental game against Washburn College (now Washburn University) that had three new rules: 1) increase first down requirement from 5 yards to 10 yards, 2) allowing forward passes (suggestion came from President Theodore Roosevelt), 3) varying points (4/5/6) for a field goal kick based on the distance.

The school discontinued its football program following the 1986 season due to financial red ink, NCAA recruiting violations, and WSU students voting against raising fees to pay for higher football expenses. It had never fully recovered from losing 16 starters, its athletic director, football coach and many others critical to the WSU program in a plane crash in 1970 (see below). Legendary NFL coach Bill Parcells was a linebacker at WSU in 1962 and 1963 before serving as a graduate assistant in 1964. Wichita State University was also the first Division I-A school to hire a black head coach in college football, Willie Jeffries, in 1979.

====1970 plane crash====
On October 2, 1970, a plane carrying players and staff of the WSU football team took off from a Colorado airport after refueling and was bound for Logan, Utah for a game against Utah State University. It flew into a mountain valley too narrow to enable it to turn back and smashed into a mountainside, killing 31 of the 40 players, administrators, and fans near a ski resort away from Denver.

==Notable alumni and faculty==
Wichita State University has produced multiple notable businessmen, including the founders of Pizza Hut Dan and Frank Carney, and Garmin founder Gary Burrell. Notable scientists include Mona Nemer, who served as the Canadian Chief Science Advisor. Notable engineers include Harold G. White, lead in NASA&#x27;s Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory, and Dwane Wallace, President and Chairman of Cessna. In the arts, graduates included opera stars Joyce DiDonato and Samuel Ramey, actor Shirley Knight and Broadway performer Karla Burns. In athletics, notable individuals include basketball players Antoine Carr and Fred VanVleet, as well as Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells. Notable politicians include U.S. Representative Garner E. Shriver, the U.S. diplomat Robert D. Blackwill and Indonesian politician Sandiaga Uno. U.S. Army captain Riley L. Pitts, who graduated with a degree in journalism, was the first African American to receive the Medal of Honor.

<text>In behavioral economics, time preference (or time discounting, delay discounting, temporal discounting, long-term orientation) is the current relative valuation placed on receiving a good at an earlier date compared with receiving it at a later date. Applications for these preferences include finance, health, climate change.

Time preferences are captured mathematically in the discount function. The main models of discounting include exponential, hyperbolic, and quasi hyperbolic. The higher the time preference, the higher the discount placed on returns receivable or costs payable in the future.

Several factors correlate with an individual’s time preference, including age, income, race, risk, and temptation. On a larger level, ideas such as sign effects, sub-additivity, and the elicitation method can influence how people display time preference. Time preference can also inform wider preferences about real world behavior and attitudes, such as pro-social behavior. Cultural differences can explain differences in discounting as they both have similar underlying psychological influences. The discount rate is also useful in many fields, such as finance and climate change.

==Example==

Calculating the discount rate: “Would you rather have $100 today or $110 in one month?” Your choice indicates your discount rate. If you choose $100 today, your discount rate is at least 10%. If you choose $110 in one month, your discount rate is less than 10%. Now how about “$100 today or $101 in one month?” Choosing the $100 today now indicates a discount rate of at least 1%, whereas choosing $101 in one month indicates that it is less than 1%. Asking a series of these questions, narrowing the interval, would show your discount rate. Typically, factors such as risk and interest rates heavily influence the choices.

A practical example: Jim and Bob go out for a drink but Jim has no money so Bob lends Jim $10. The next day Jim visits Bob and says, &quot;Bob, you can have $10 now, or I will give you $15 when I get paid at the end of the month.&quot; Bob&#x27;s time preference will change depending on his trust in Jim, whether he needs the money now, or if he thinks he can wait; or if he&#x27;d prefer to have $15 at the end of the month rather than $10 now. Present and expected needs, present and expected income affect one&#x27;s time preference.

== History and development of time preference ==
Work on time preference began with John Rae’s “The Sociological Theory of Capital” in an attempt to answer why wealth differed across nations. He theorized that it was due to differences in saving an investment from the population, ultimately driven by tolerance for uncertainty and ability to delay gratification. Later, views expanded to examine why individuals may have differences in how they trade off benefits between the present and the future. Some theories include risk, preferences for immediate gratification, and ability to estimate future wants. This means that people may view the future as uncertain, and therefore, they should consume now instead of saving for later. They may also have a compulsion to consume now and are unable to delay the pleasure. Lastly, they may be unable to comprehend their future needs and wants. Irving Fisher was the first person to model these choices economically as a tradeoff between your current and future self.

        Such ideas were later formalized by Paul Samuelson in “A Note on Measurement of Utility.” In this paper, he described a model wherein people want to maximize their utility over all future periods, with future utility being devalued exponentially from the present value.

=== Neoclassical views ===
In the neoclassical theory of interest due to Irving Fisher, the rate of time preference is usually taken as a parameter in an individual&#x27;s utility function which captures the trade off between consumption today and consumption in the future, and is thus exogenous and subjective. It is also the underlying determinant of the real rate of interest. The rate of return on investment is generally seen as return on capital, with the real rate of interest equal to the marginal product of capital at any point in time. Arbitrage, in turn, implies that the return on capital is equalized with the interest rate on financial assets (adjusting for factors such as inflation and risk). Consumers, who are facing a choice between consumption and saving, respond to the difference between the market interest rate and their own subjective rate of time preference (&quot;impatience&quot;) and increase or decrease their current consumption according to this difference. This changes the amount of funds available for investment and capital accumulation, as in for example the Ramsey growth model.

In the long run steady state, consumption&#x27;s share in a person&#x27;s income is constant which pins down the rate of interest as equal to the rate of time preference, with the marginal product of capital adjusting to ensure this equality holds. It is important to note that in this view, it is not that people discount the future because they can receive positive interest rates on their savings. Rather, the causality goes in the opposite direction; interest rates must be positive in order to induce impatient individuals to forgo current consumption in favor of future.

Time preference is a key component of the Austrian school of economics; it is used to understand the relationship between saving, investment and interest rates.

=== Historical understanding of time preference theory in relation to interest rates ===
The Catholic scholastic philosophers firstly brought up sophisticated explanations and justifications of return on capital, including risk and the opportunity cost of profit forgone, associated with the discount factor. However, they failed to interpret the interest on a riskless loan and hence denounced the time preference discounter as sinful and usurious.

Later, Conrad Summenhart, a theologian at the University of Tübingen, used time preference to explain the discount loans, where the lenders won&#x27;t profit usuriously from the loans as the borrowers would accept the price the lenders ask. A half-century later, Martin de Azpilcueta Navarrus, a Dominican canon lawyer and monetary theorist at the University of Salamanca, held the view that present goods, such as money, will naturally be worth more on the market than future goods (money). At about the same time, Gian Francesco Lottini da Volterra, an Italian humanist and politician, discovered time preference and contemplated time preference as an overestimation of &quot;a present&quot; that can be grasped immediately by the senses. Two centuries later, Ferdinando Galiani, a Neapolitan abbot, used an analogy to point out that just similar to the exchange rate, the interest rate links and equates the present value to the future value, and under people&#x27;s subjective mind, these two physically non-identical items should be equal.

These scattered thoughts and progression of theories inspired Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, a French statesman, to generate a full-scale time preference theory: what must be compared in a loan transaction is not the value of money lent with the value repaid, but rather the &#x27;value of the promise of a sum of money compared to the value of money available now; in addition, he analyzed the relation between money supply and interest rates: If money supply increases and people with insensitive time preference receive the money, then these people tend to hoard money for savings instead of going for consumptions, which will cause interest rates to fall while prices to rise.

== Models of time preference—time discounting ==
Temporal discounting (also known as delay discounting, time discounting) is the tendency of people to discount rewards as they approach a temporal horizon in the future or the past (i.e., become so distant in time that they cease to be valuable or to have addictive effects). To put it another way, it is a tendency to give greater value to rewards as they move away from their temporal horizons and towards the &quot;now&quot;. For instance, a nicotine deprived smoker may highly value a cigarette available any time in the next 6 hours but assign little or no value to a cigarette available in 6 months.

Regarding terminology, from Frederick et al. (2002):
This term is used in intertemporal economics, intertemporal choice, neurobiology of reward and decision making, microeconomics and recently neuroeconomics. Traditional models of economics assumed that the discounting function is exponential in time leading to a monotonic decrease in preference with increased time delay; however, more recent neuroeconomic models suggest a hyperbolic discount function which can address the phenomenon of preference reversal.
Temporal discounting is also a theory particularly relevant to the political decisions of individuals, as people often put their short term political interests before the longer term policies. This can be applied to the way individuals vote in elections but can also apply to how they contribute to societal issues like climate change, that is primarily a long term threat and therefore not prioritized.

There have been many mathematical models of time preference that attempt to explain intertemporal preferences.

=== Exponential discounted utility ===
Exponential discounted utility was first described in the discounted utility model. The equation is as follows:

formula_1

where

formula_2

is commonly thought of as the discount function, with formula_3  being the discount rate. It says that your value of the future is exponentially less than your value of the present, as scaled by formula_3 and formula_5 . Although the equation was never meant to be &quot;normative&quot;, ie, making a recommendation as to how people behave, it was the first template for modeling utility over time. Later, its &quot;descriptive&quot;, validity, or ability to describe how people actually behave, was evaluated. Inconsistencies led to the theorizing of a new equation for time preference.

=== Hyperbolic discounting ===
Although the exponential equation provides a nice rationale for discounting in accordance with utility theory, the apparent rate, when measured in the lab, is not constant. It actually declines over time. This means that the difference between receiving $10 tomorrow and $11 in two days is different from receiving $10 in 100 days and $11 in 101 days. Although the difference between the values and the times is the same, people &quot;value&quot; the two options at a different discount rate. The $1 is more heavily discounted between tomorrow and two days than it is between 100 and 101 days, meaning that people prefer the $10 option more in the two day case than in the 100 day case.

Such preferences fit a hyperbolic curve. The first hyperbolic delay function was of the form

formula_6

This function describes a difference between the discount rate today and the next period, and then constant discounting after. It is commonly called the formula_7 model.

A simple hyperbolic delay discounting equation is that of

formula_8

Where formula_9 is the discounted value, formula_10 is the non-discounted value, formula_5 is the discount rate, and formula_12 is the delay. This is one of the most common hyperbolic discounting functions used today, and is especially useful in comparing two discounting scenarios, as the formula_5 parameter can be easily interpreted.

=== Quasi-hyperbolic discounting ===
The last major model is that of quasi-hyperbolic discounting. Researchers found that there is a first day effect, meaning that people greatly value immediate rewards over those in the future. Like the previous example, imagine now that you are offered $10 today or $11 tomorrow. You are also offered $10 tomorrow or $11 in two days. The preference for the $10 in the today case is typically greater than the preference for the $10 tomorrow case.

This can be captured by a quasi-hyperbolic curve, wherein there is a fitted parameter for the magnitude of the first day effect. This is commonly called the beta-delta model, wherein there is a beta parameter that accounts for the present bias. The equation for utility over time looks like

formula_14

This explains that the sum of your current and all future utilities is equal to a delta parameter multiplied by your current utility plus all your future discounted utilities (scaled by beta).

== Asymmetries in time preference and preference reversals ==
Despite the equations meant to describe behavior, when measuring preferences over real world decisions, it was noted that there were some inconsistencies. People’s preferences would change based on the framing of the question or the exact decision being made; one discount rate was hard to find.  The main findings are as follows “(1) gains are discounted more than losses; (2) small amounts are discounted more than large amounts; (3) greater discounting is shown to avoid delay of a good than to expedite its receipt; (4) in choices over sequences of outcomes, improving sequences are often preferred to declining sequences though positive time preference dictates the opposite; and (5) in choices over sequences, violations of independence are pervasive, and people seem to prefer spreading consumption over time in a way that diminishing marginal utility alone cannot explain”.

=== Sign and magnitude effects ===
Work by Richard Thaler found the first two main effects. To measure gains and losses, he asked about the same numerical earnings or debts framed as winnings from a bank lottery or a traffic ticket. He found that gains are discounted more than losses, meaning that, they valued earning money sooner than delaying debts. He also found the discount rate to be higher when asking about tradeoffs between large amounts of money versus small amounts of money, even though the rate of substitution was the same.

Some current work explains the psychological underpinnings of these findings. One suggestion is the idea of contemplation emotion, or the feeling of waiting for an event to occur. The idea is that one wants a positive event to occur and does not want to wait for it; on the other hand, people may not mind to delay a negative outcome such as a monetary loss. This can help explain the sign effect.

=== Temptation ===
Classic economic theory says that more options does not decrease utility. If you are given a completely useless option, it does not hurt you, because you can simply decide not to take it, and your information only increases. However, dynamic inconsistencies can be explained by rational beliefs and temptation. Essentially, there is a psychological cost to resisting the temptation of an activity, so you restrict your future choice set to not include the tempting activity for your long term benefit. Such theories explain why people pay in advance for commitment devices. For example, a person has to choose what to do in the future: nap or go to the gym. They may choose to form some sort of commitment device to go to the gym. Economic theory would argue that the person would be better off leaving the option to nap open, if there is no cost. However, theories of temptation argue that removing the option to nap removed the cost of rejecting the temptation to nap.

=== Sub additive discounting ===
Sub additive discounting is an example of sub additive preferences, meaning that when a problem is broken down into its individual components, people assign greater weights to the components than they would to the whole. In the context of time preference, it is argued that as the interval of time is broken down into smaller and smaller partitions, discounting increases. Daniel Read found evidence of this wherein discounting was much lower when the time interval was divided into three separate parts. He argues that this responsible for the hyperbolic appearance of discount preferences.

=== Experimental elicitation methods ===
There have been many attempts to measure a discount rate using experimental methods. Yet, there is still no consensus on the rate. This may be due to the varying elicitation methods for the studies themselves. Put another way, how a study asks questions to uncover the discount rate can influence the result itself.

The first experiments to measure discount rates were called MEL (money earlier or later) experiments, wherein participants were asked about their preferences between receiving a certain some of money now and a different sum of money later. Yet, measures of time preferences and inter-temporal tradeoffs came before this. One of the most famous examples is that of the marshmallow experiment. In this Mischel and Ebbesen told kids that they could have one marshmallow now, or, if they waited until the experimenter left and returned, they could have two.

The most common way to measure discount rates is as follows. Offered a choice of $100 today and $100 in one month, individuals will most likely choose the $100 now. However, should the question change to having $100 today, or $1,000 in one month, individuals will most likely choose the $1,000 in one month. The $100 can be conceptualized as a Smaller Sooner Reward (SSR), and the $1,000 can be conceptualized as a Larger Later Reward (LLR). Researchers who study temporal discounting are interested in the point in time in which an individual changes their preference for the SSR to the LLR, or vice versa. For example, although an individual may prefer $1,000 in one month over $100 now, they may switch their preference to the $100 if the delay to the $1,000 is increased to 60 months (5 years). This means that this person values $1,000, after a delay of 60 months, less than $100 now. The key is to find the point in time in which the individual values the LLR and the SSR as being equivalent. That is known as the &quot;indifference point&quot;. Preferences can be measured by asking people to make a series of choices between immediate and delayed payoffs, where the delay period and the payoff amounts are varied.

=== Revealed preferences methods ===
Another stream of research focuses on estimating the discount rate from data on real world choices. Many economic models have looked at different financial puzzles and decisions to estimate a discount rate. Some types of data include asset purchases and pricing, high frequency consumption data, or social security payments. All of these situations involve financial decisions between the present and future. Therefore, one can fit an economic model to the situation, and then estimate the discount parameter.

As another example, one can infer the environmental discount rate from something like air conditioner purchases. This is because, investing in an energy efficient air conditioner saves both money and energy in the long run but requires more money upfront. This setup establishes a tradeoff between current value (money now) vs future value (savings later). One paper analyzed a survey of air conditioner purchases using a hedonic pricing method. Essentially, “the price of a good is specified as a function of a set of its attributes,” and they find that the discount rate is 13.6%.

== Differences in time preference ==
Although the average discount rate may be of interest, that average typically obscures differences in individual valuations. Many factors that differ by people can influence their discount rates. This helps predict time preference for specific subgroups.

=== Age &amp; Income ===
The effect of age on discounting has long been studied. There are many theories as to why age might affect time preference: risk tolerance, time perspective, and importantly, the covariant of income. In one of the most cited studies on this topic describes this interaction, the authors find that in a high-income group, discounting was the same across ages. However, within the group of older adults, being low income greatly increased discounting. A recent meta-analysis on the effect of age alone concluded that there is no effect of age alone on discounting. A response to this article explained that although there may be no overall effect, within specific income groups, there are differences by age. Although age doesn’t affect high-income people’s time preferences, it does affect the low-income group. Younger, low-income people have higher discounting than older, low-income people. They also provide a mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs: a scarcity mindset increases discounting. By controlling for scarcity, the differences in discounting disappeared. Such results indicate that low-income, younger people experience more distress caused by scarcity, which causes them to want rewards more immediately.

=== Gender ===
Gender may also influence the rate of time preference. It has been shown that men generally exhibit a higher rate of discounting than women, choosing sooner rewards more often. It is theorized that it is due to women’s ability to delay gratification, and this ability is also useful in real life scenarios. Such situations include motherhood and saving/investment. Women may be more suited towards long term orientation because they are tasked more with parenting. It has also been found that women save and invest more, which may mean they are more adapted to delayed gratification.

=== Race ===
Race is also thought to play a role in time preference. Andreoni et al. find that a child’s ability to wait for a larger later reward was correlated with race. They did this by asking the children a series of decisions in which they could choose candy that same day or a larger amount of candy which they would receive on the next day. In analyzing the data by race, they found that black children, across all ages, were more likely to make impatient decisions than other races. In more specific contexts, race was also found to play a role. In a study of the utility of long term water quality improvements, Viscusi et al. find that black respondents displayed higher discounting than other racial groups.

=== Connection to future self ===
Another factor which may influence time preference is one’s connection to their future self. This means your ability to envision or share emotions with one’s future self. Therefore, if you feel more connected to your future, it may be easier to delay gratification. This theory has been tested in several ways. One study measured psychological connectedness by asking participants to rate how close they felt to their future selves. They also asked the participants to rate the connectedness of fictional characters. In both cases, those who felt more intertemporally connected were also more able to delay rewards.

=== Early life stress ===
A meta-analysis of early life stress, time preference, and prosocial preferences found that early life stress is predictive of time preference. The theory goes that early life stress affects our ability to think about the future. If you have more early life stress, you become more present focused to manage the current situation. The theory was confirmed in the analysis, wherein more early life stress was significantly correlated with present orientation on a future discounting task. Early life stress was also shown to be predictive of lower prosocial preferences.

== Applications ==
Many broad societal problems about how to allocate social goods between now and the future depend on time preference. Governments typically model future outcomes of the economy and planet according to some discount rate. In doing so, they are trying to calculate the welfare of both the current and future generations, taking into account issues such as stated preferences, revealed preferences, and objective future outcomes.

=== Interest rates ===
Discount rates and traditional economic problems both inform and are influenced by each other. For example, the interest rate plays an important role in individual discount rates. If one can accumulate interest at a certain rate, say 5% per year, one should not have a discount rate below this. Say you are offered $100 today or $105 in one year. You should be, at the very least, indifferent between the two, regardless of other factors. This is because, if you take the money now and invest it, you will also have $105 in one year. Coller and Williams find this to be true, showing that when you give participants information about the real world interest rates, their elicited discount rate falls.

=== Climate change ===
The discount rate is particularly important in the study of climate change. Economist Thomas Schelling argued that climate change is an intergenerational discounting problem, where we are essentially deciding how to distribute utility between the current and future generations. Crucially, he also argues that we need to also consider other ways in which we can increase the well being of underdeveloped countries both now and in the future. Climate abatement techniques, viewed through this lens, need to be weighed against other wealth redistributions, such as direct payments or subsidies for other goods and industries.

One of the first papers to address this issue was Frank Ramsey’s “A Mathematical Theory of Saving.” In it, he calculates the amount which a nation should save to protect future generations. He does this by trying to maximize the utility of all generations cumulatively. In solving this maximization problem, we get an equation of the form

formula_15

Here, formula_16 is the rate of time preference, or the discount rate. It is the sum of the pure rate of time preference (formula_17) and the growth rate of per capita consumption (formula_18), adjusted by the factor (formula_19), which represents the impact of economic growth on the discount rate.

The next big finding on the climate discount rate was the Stern Review. It was a report commissioned by the UK government in 2006 on the state of climate change. Major finding of the report is that urgent action is needed to avert the worst impacts of climate change; much more urgent than previously thought. This is due to his estimation of the discount rate. In the report, Stern sets the Ramsey parameters to formula_20, formula_21 and formula_22 , meaning formula_23 . With a discount rate this low, meaning future generations are almost equally as valued, this means that society needs to drastically reduce consumption.

There was push back against this idea, most notably from economist William Nordhaus. He wrote several papers reviewing the Stern Report and the assumptions in it. He argues that the near zero rate of time preference (formula_20) is critical to the recommendations made. Furthermore, he says that a higher discount rate is consistence with market interest rates.

There is no consensus still on the climate discount rate that should be used. Considerations from experts span morality, interest rates, consumer preferences, intergenerational equity, and global equity. At the country level, the revealed environmental discount rates can span from 1%-10%.

==Differences in time preference across countries==
Since many of the psychological factors that cause discounting behavior also vary across countries, it makes sense that time preference may not be universal. Due to cultural factors, different countries may view allocations between the present and the future differently.

Origins

Differences of time preferences across countries have been found in several large-scale studies, in particular the INTRA study and the GPS study.

Oded Galor and Omer Ozak explore the roots of observed differences in time preference across nations. They establish that pre-industrial agricultural characteristics that were favorable to higher return to agricultural investment triggered a process of selection, adaptation, and learning that brought about a higher prevalence of long-term orientation. These agricultural characteristics are associated with contemporary economic and human behavior such as technological adoption, education, saving, and smoking.

The most comprehensive data set of time preferences encompasses 117 countries and is calculated by merging several previous datasets, including the aforementioned INTRA- and GPS-data, but also, e.g., survey questions from the World Value Survey.

=== Current cross cultural studies ===
Many cross-cultural studies look at the differences between two or three countries. However, some have gone further. A study on 53 counties found significant differences in time preference by country.

=== Cultural differences in predictors of time preferences ===
There are many cultural differences that influence perceptions in general. Some aspects of culture which may be relevant to time preference include individualism/collectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and long term orientation. Countries with higher uncertainty avoidance have higher present bias, meaning they discount the future more steeply. On the other hand, countries higher in individualism and long term orientation discount less steeply.

== What time preferences predict about real world behavior ==
Time preferences to not just measure differences in allocation between now and the future. Individual differences in time preference can indicate larger personality differences. This personality can predict other behavior.

=== Prosocial behavior ===
One major area of focus for time preference effects is that of prosocial behavior. This is as future allocation problems typically benefit others beyond oneself. One study found that individuals with “Future time preference” were more willing to forgo money for future others benefit. Yet, the results are still not widely confirmed. Another study by Jones and Rachlin found that only social and probability discounting predicted public-good contributions. Social discounting measures the rate at which one will tradeoff money between them and another person receiving it. For example, say you were offered $50, but if you forego it, your friend gets $60. What about your friend being offered $100. The point at which you forego the money is the social discount rate. Generally, this type of discounting resembles a hyperbolic curve as well. Probability discounting takes the same form, but with risk. Say you were offered a certain $50 or a $100 with a 50% chance of winning it. How about a 60% chance? Probability discounting is likewise hyperbolic. Both of these indicate that allocation preferences over an intangible dimension can predict more representative choices, such as donations to public goods. However, the study did not find a significant effect of delay discounting (or time preference) on public-good contributions.

== Estimating time preference and domain differences ==
Although classic economics would say that the discount rate should be the same across domains, empirical findings have shown that this is not true. There are differences in how people discount outcomes in different domains. Specifically, three fields have been examined: money, health, and climate.

Initial research in this area was pioneered by Chapman and Elstein, who discovered discrepancies between how people discount health versus monetary outcomes. They asked people about how much they would trade between current and future money, health, and vacation outcomes. They had to choose between sooner smaller and larger later outcomes of money payments, vacation days, and illness treatment.  

The findings from Odum, Baumann, and Rimington echoed earlier research by showing that individuals displayed more patience when discounting money compared to directly consumable rewards such as alcohol and food. This result, however, was only found within-subjects, meaning that people who were asked both questions discounted consumables more steeply. Between subjects (asking each group only one of the questions) did not replicate. Similar results were highlighted by Estle et al., who found consistent patterns of steeper discounting for direct consumables compared to monetary rewards. This result has been confirmed in many subsequent studies, with the hypothesis pointing to the fact that temptation is a driving factor in the difference.

Domain differences have also been found with respect to climate change. The climate discount rate has been compared to health and money. Some studies find that it is discounted differently. Further supporting the importance of domain-specific differences, Tabi utilized revealed preferences to measure discounting differences in domains including winning money, flood risk prevention, life-saving measures, and climate costs. His findings revealed significant variability, ranging from a discount rate of 3% for saving lives in 100 years to 29% for adaptation efforts to prevent flooding. This substantial variation underscores the unique considerations each domain carries.

Together, these reviews indicate that the domain of the reward or consequence plays a significant role in discounting behavior, whether it involves money, health, consumables, or environmental outcomes. The insights from these studies emphasize the importance of understanding domain-specific discounting to inform policy and decision-making across various fields.

<doc id="253985" wikidata="Q970245" url="?curid=253985" title="Harold Monro">
<text>Harold Edward Monro (14 March 1879 – 16 March 1932) was an English poet born in Brussels, Belgium. As the proprietor of the Poetry Bookshop in London, he helped many poets to bring their work before the public.

==Life and career==
Monro was born at 137 Chaussée de Charleroi, Saint-Gilles/St Gillis, Brussels, on 14 March 1879, as the youngest of three surviving children of Edward William Monro (1848–1889), civil engineer, and his wife and first cousin, Arabel Sophia (1849–1926), daughter of Peter John Margary, also a civil engineer. Monro&#x27;s father was born at Marylebone and died aged 41 when Monro was only nine years old. The Monro family was well established in Bloomsbury. His paternal grandfather, Dr Henry Munro FRCP MD, was a surgeon, born at Gower St, Bloomsbury, in 1817.

Monro was educated at Radley College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. His first collection of poetry was published in 1906. He also edited a poetry magazine, &quot;The Poetry Review&quot;, which became influential. In 1913, he founded the Poetry Bookshop at 35 Devonshire Street in Bloomsbury, where he published new collections at his own expense and sometimes made a profit, while providing a welcoming environment for readers and poets. Several poets, including Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, lodged in the rooms above the shop. Monro and the Poetry Bookshop were also involved with Edward Marsh in publishing the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; series.

Monro also founded and edited &quot;Poetry and Drama&quot;. Between 1910 and 1914, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who had established Italian Futurism with the publication of the first Futurist manifesto in 1909, gave readings and lectures in London with a view to establishing an English Futurism. Initially, he had an ally in Monro, who devoted the September 1913 issue of &quot;Poetry and Drama t&quot;o Futurism, praising Marinetti in a long editorial. Marinetti&#x27;s campaign both threatened and influenced Ezra Pound, who founded his own literary movement, Imagism, and wrote manifestos to publicize it while attacking Futurism. Vorticism was the second London literary movement both opposing and reflecting Marinetti&#x27;s, with Pound as a major collaborator.

==War and peace==
Monro wrote few war poems himself, but his &quot;Youth in Arms&quot; quartet, written in the early months of the First World War, is one of the first attempts to envisage the &quot;human psychology&quot; of soldiering and understand &quot;how ungrudgingly Youth dies.&quot; These poems were inspired by Monro&#x27;s fears for his friend, Basil Watt, whom he dearly loved and who was later killed at Loos. Monro&#x27;s elegy for Watt, &quot;Lament in 1915&quot;, is a monologue in unornamented, modern language.

&lt;poem&gt;
Happy boy, happy boy,
David the immortal-willed, 
Youth a thousand thousand times Slain, but not once killed, 
Swaggering again today 
In the old contemptuous way;

Leaning backward from your thigh 
Up against the tinselled bar —
Dust and ashes! is it you?
Laughing, boasting, there you are! 
First we hardly recognized you 
In your modern avatar.

Soldier, rifle, brown khaki —
Is your blood as happy so? 
Where&#x27;s your sling or painted shield, Helmet, pike or bow? 
Well, you&#x27;re going to the wars —
That is all you need to know.

Graybeards plotted. They were sad.
Death was in their wrinkled eyes. 
At their tables—with their maps,
Plans and calculations—wise 
They all seemed; for well they knew 
How ungrudgingly Youth dies.

At their green official baize 
They debated all the night 
Plans for your adventurous days 
Which you followed with delight, 
Youth in all your wanderings, 
David of a thousand slings.
&lt;/poem&gt;

After the war, Monro wrote his somewhat trenchant overview &quot;Some Contemporary Poets (1920)&quot;, though this was not published by the Poetry Bookshop. He also founded &quot;The Chapbook&quot; (1919–1925, his third journal after &quot;The Poetry Review&quot; and &quot;Poetry and Drama&quot;, 1913–1914), which was not commercially viable, but contained some of his best work as a poet. His intention was to find &quot;cultural middle ground&quot; between modernism and the more traditional work exemplified by the Georgians. In this Monro took a broad view of the sphere of poetry, devoting whole numbers to children&#x27;s rhymes and to songs by Walter de la Mare complete with scores.

==Marriages==

The young Monro was raised together with his sister Mary (died 1921) by their widowed mother, who remarried in 1910 to Sir Daniel Fulthorpe Gooch (1829–1926). Monro&#x27;s stepbrother Lancelot Daniel Edward Gooch, a midshipman on &quot;HMS Implacable&quot;, died a fortnight after his 18th birthday in Greece, on 4 October 1915. On 2 December 1903 in Eastbourne, Monro married Dorothy Elizabeth Browne. Their son Nigel Monro (1904–1951) was born in Ireland, where Harold was working as a land agent for a family friend. However, the marriage was not to last and in 1908, the couple separated. The son followed Monro family medical tradition and practised as a surgeon.

In March 1913 Monro met Alida Klemantaski, 17 years his junior, from Hampstead, who also had a passion for poetry and had set herself goals of becoming a doctor or rescuing prostitutes from their predicament. Monro instead persuaded her that by working in the Poetry Bookshop, she would be achieving just as much for society. They were married in 1920. Alida&#x27;s brother Louis Klemantaski, a promising young poet and musical editor died at the Somme in 1916. It is said that Alida had a greater influence than anyone on the development of Monro&#x27;s own poetry.

==Disappointment==
In his later years, Monro reflected on whether the Poetry Bookshop had fulfilled its purpose and whether it should be closed, but he was too deeply attached to it. According to the English literary historian Dominic Hibberd, &quot;By now Monro was a disappointed man, appalled at the state of Europe and feeling forgotten by the poets he had helped.&quot; He had used up most of his money subsidising the shop.

On top of a drinking problem, Monro contracted tuberculosis. He died on 16 March 1932, aged 53, at the Cliff Combe Nursing Home, Broadstairs, Kent, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on the 19th. He was remembered as being liberal-minded and without literary prejudices. &quot;Perhaps no one did more for the advancement of twentieth-century poetry.&quot;

==To what God?==
On Monday, 4 August 2014, a service was held at Westminster Abbey as &quot;A Solemn Commemoration on the Centenary of the Outbreak of the First World War&quot;, HRH Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, representing HM the Queen. After a reading from &quot;St John&#x27;s Gospel&quot;, the choir gave the first performance of a new composition by David Matthews, a pupil of Benjamin Britten, setting a bitter, disillusioned 1914 poem by Harold Monro, &quot;To what God shall we chant our songs of battle?&quot; alongside passages from &quot;Lamentations&quot; and &quot;St Luke&quot;. James O&#x27;Donnell, Abbey organist and master of the choristers, commented that the work &quot;leaves you standing on the edge of an abyss.&quot;

&lt;poem&gt;
To what God
Shall we chant
Our songs of Battle? 
Oh, to whom shall a song of battle be chanted? 
Not to our lord of the hosts on his ancient throne, 
Drowsing the ages out in Heaven alone. 
The celestial choirs are mute, the angels have fled:
Word is gone forth abroad that our lord is dead. 
Is it nothing to you, all you that pass by? 
Behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow.

To what God
Shall we chant
Our songs of Battle? 
Oh, to whom shall a song of battle be chanted? 
If you had only recognised on this day the things that make for peace! 
But now they are hidden from your eyes. 
Oh, to whom shall a song of battle be chanted?
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="253987" wikidata="Q5258298" url="?curid=253987" title="Dennis Cooley">
<text>Dennis Cooley (born 1944) is a Canadian writer of poetry and criticism, a retired university professor, and a vital figure in the evolution of the prairie long poem. He was raised on a farm near the small city of Estevan, Saskatchewan in Canada, and currently resides in Winnipeg, Manitoba. 

Cooley&#x27;s self-proclaimed influences in writing are William Carlos Williams, H.D., Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, E.E. Cummings, Eli Mandel, Andrew Suknaski, Daphne Marlatt, bpNichol, Michael Ondaatje, and Robert Kroetsch.

==Early life==
As a student, Cooley held a variety of different labouring jobs during the summers.
First attending secondary schooling at the University of Saskatchewan, Cooley obtained with added Distinction his Bachelor of Education Degree in 1966, a High Honours Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1967 and afterwards upgraded to his Masters of Arts Degree on Stephen Crane&#x27;s imagery and symbolism in 1968.

Cooley later moved to New York state to attend the University of Rochester. It was there that Cooley prepared the research for his doctorate on the San Francisco-born American poet, Robert Duncan. He received the Ph. D in 1971.

==Career==
From 1972 to 1973, Cooley was employed within the Blakeney Government in Saskatchewan as an executive assistant. Apart from this, most of Cooley&#x27;s working life has been teaching English. 

He has worked at St. John&#x27;s College since 1976 as the Organizer of Literary Conferences within the University of Manitoba and taught Early Modern and Contemporary poetry, specializing in Robert Duncan, Dorothy Livesay, Margaret Atwood, Robert Kroetsch, Eli Mandel, Prairie Literature, the Long poem in the Twentieth Century, Canadian Writers in Self-construction, Fundamentals of Literary
Theory, American Literature, Creative Writing, Poetry &amp; Media 1994–1995, Narratology &amp; Postcolonialism.
He retired from in 2011.

He has since helped start create the Manitoba Writers’ Guild, and is currently President.
The Guild, founded in 1981 in Aubigny, Manitoba as a support group for Manitoba writers, offers workshops, conducts local reading groups and a peer support network for enhancing and encouraging other writers of all skill levels.

Cooley is also an editor, and from 1975 to 1976 was the Assistant Editor on the Journal of Canadian Fiction, the Poetry Editor of Arts Manitoba from 1978 to 1979 and 1982–1983, the Contributing Editor to Border Crossings from 1989 to 1993, as well as the Editor at the Pachyderm Press from 1993 onward. He also served as the Workshop Leader at the Sage Hill Writing Experience in 1992, 1998, 1999, and 2000.

Cooley is a founding editor of the Turnstone Press in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which was created in 1976 in a local Winnipeg pub. Turnstone promotes authors who are either landed immigrants or Canadian citizens, with fifty percent featuring local Manitoba content and Manitoban writers.

==Writing==
Cooley specializes in different genres of poetry; such as literary travel, literary criticism, and the long poem.
He shows special interest in Canadian Literature, American Writing, modern and postmodern writing, the languages of orality and print, poetry and politics, and literary theory.
To date, Cooley has published a dozen volumes of poetry, and over a hundred various articles, columns, reviews, and interviews.

Cooley has travelled abroad to share his talent by giving workshops, lectures and readings to places such as Ukraine and Russia (Kyiv, Odesa, Lviv, Chernivtsi, and Moscow) in May 1991, to the World Poetry Conference in Portugal in May 1995 and again in May 2001, Berlin in August 2002, Poland in April 1999, and Spain in December 1998. To benefit those who don&#x27;t read his native language of English, some of his work has been translated into Portuguese, German, Chinese and Ukrainian.

Cooley gave his time to the University of Augsburg in the summer of 1996 by being the Canadian Studies guest professor.

Cooley is currently keeping busy by working on personal travel journals, poetry books, and a plethora of essays.
