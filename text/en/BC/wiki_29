<text>John Joseph O&#x27;Connor (January 15, 1920 – May 3, 2000) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of New York from 1984 until his death in 2000, and was made a cardinal in 1985.

O&#x27;Connor previously served as a U.S. Navy chaplain (1952 to 1979), including four years as chief of chaplains, as an auxiliary bishop of the Military Vicariate of the United States (1979 to 1983), and as Bishop of Scranton from 1983 to 1984.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
John O&#x27;Connor was born in Philadelphia on January 15, 1920, the fourth of five children of Thomas J. O&#x27;Connor, and Dorothy Magdalene (née Gomple) O&#x27;Connor. Thomas was a painter and Dorothy was the daughter of Gustave Gumpel, a kosher butcher and Jewish rabbi. In 2014, it was discovered that Dorothy was baptized a Catholic at age 19 and that the couple wed one year later.

O&#x27;Connor attended public schools in Philadelphia until his junior year of high school, when he enrolled in West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys. Having decided to become a priest, he then enrolled at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.

=== Priesthood ===
After graduating from St. Charles, O&#x27;Connor was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia on December 15, 1945, in Philadelphia by Auxiliary Bishop Hugh L. Lamb. After his 1945 ordination, the archdiocese assigned O&#x27;Connor as a faculty member at St. James High School in Chester, Pennsylvania. During this seven-year period, O&#x27;Connor obtained a Master of Arts degree in advanced ethics from Villanova University in Philadelphia and a Master of Arts degree in clinical psychology from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.
O&#x27;Connor joined the United States Navy Chaplain Corps in 1952 during the Korean War.He was eventually named rear admiral and chief of chaplains of the Navy in 1975.He obtained approval for the establishment of the RP [Religious Program Specialist] Enlisted Rating, and oversaw the process of standing up this rating. The RP rating provided chaplains with a dedicated enlisted community. The Vatican named O&#x27;Connor as an honorary prelate of his holiness on October 27, 1966.

O&#x27;Connor received a doctorate in political science from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he studied under future United Nations ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick said of O&#x27;Connor that he was &quot;... surely one of the two or three smartest graduate students I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

=== Auxiliary Bishop of the Military Vicariate US ===
On April 24, 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed O&#x27;Connor as an auxiliary bishop of the Military Vicariate for the United States and titular bishop of Cursola. He was consecrated to the episcopate on May 27, 1979, at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome by John Paul himself, with Cardinals Duraisamy Lourdusamy and Eduardo Somalo acting as co-consecrators.

=== Bishop of Scranton ===
On May 6, 1983, John Paul II named O&#x27;Connor as bishop of Scranton; he was installed in that position on June 29, 1983.

=== Archbishop of New York ===

On January 26, 1984, after the death of Cardinal Terence Cooke, O&#x27;Connor was appointed archbishop of New York and administrator of the Military Vicariate by John Paul II; O&#x27;Connor was installed on March 19, 1984.

O&#x27;Connor was elevated to cardinal in the May 25, 1985, consistory, with the titular church of &quot;Santi Giovanni e Paolo&quot; in Rome (the traditional one for the Archbishop of New York from 1946 to 2009).

On December 10, 1989, 4,500 members of ACT UP and Women&#x27;s Health Action and Mobilization (WHAM) demonstrated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan to voice their opposition to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s positions on HIV/AIDS education, the distribution of condoms in public schools, and abortion rights for women. Police arrested 43 protestors from inside the cathedral.

Throughout his tenure as archbishop of New York, Cardinal O&#x27;Connor advocated on behalf of many groups whom he believed to be downtrodden, but there was no group that he advocated for more strongly than the unborn. To that end, O&#x27;Connor started a religious order of women known as the Sisters of Life, which still exists today.

O&#x27;Connor had a close relationship with Pope John Paul II, and both leaders were very similar in their emphasis, including a focus on the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. When naming O&#x27;Connor the Archbishop of New York in 1984, the pope is purported to have said &quot;I want someone like myself in New York&quot;. In 1995, for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, Pope Saint John Paul II visited New York and while there, O&#x27;Connor hosted him at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral for a rosary service on October 7, 1995 for which O&#x27;Connor appointed Joseph Polchinski as one of the servers.

=== Illness and death ===
When O&#x27;Connor reached the retirement age for bishops of 75 years in January 1995, he submitted his resignation to Pope John Paul II as required by canon law. However the pope did not accept the resignation, and O&#x27;Connor continued to serve as Archbishop of New York until his death.

O&#x27;Connor was diagnosed in 1999 with a brain tumor, and died in the archbishop&#x27;s residence in Manhattan on May 3, 2000. He was interred in the crypt beneath the main altar of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. His funeral was presided over by Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano. At O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s request, Cardinal Bernard F. Law delivered the homily and Cardinal William W. Baum the eulogy. Attendees at O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s funeral included:
* Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan
* US President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
* Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
* former President George H. W. Bush and Texas Governor George W. Bush
* New York Governor George Pataki 
* New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, former New York City Mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins.

==Legacy==
* The John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor Pavilion in the Bronx, a residence for retired priests, opened in 2003. 
* The John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor School in Irvington, New York, for students with learning differences, opened in 2009. 
* The Cardinal O&#x27;Connor Conference on Life is held annually at Georgetown University.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called O&#x27;Connor &quot;a familiar and towering presence, a leader whose views and personality were forcefully injected into the great civic debates of his time, a man who considered himself a conciliator, but who never hesitated to be a combatant&quot;, and one of the Catholic Church&#x27;s &quot;most powerful symbols on moral and political issues.&quot;

According to New York City Mayor Ed Koch: &quot;Cardinal O&#x27;Connor was a great man, but he was like the Pentagon. He was incapable of saving money.&quot;

* Jackie Robinson Empire State Medal of Freedom – December 21, 2000 
* Congressional Gold Medal – March 7, 2000

== Viewpoints ==

=== Human life ===
O&#x27;Connor was a forceful opponent of abortion, human cloning, capital punishment, human trafficking, and unjust war.

* O&#x27;Connor in 1996 assailed what he called the &quot;horror of euthanasia&quot;, asking rhetorically, &quot;What makes us think that permitted lawful suicide will not become obligated suicide?&quot; 
* In 2000, O&#x27;Connor called for a &quot;major overhaul&quot; of the punitive Rockefeller drug laws in New York State, which he believed produced &quot;grave injustices&quot;.

===US foreign policy===

* In the 1980s, O&#x27;Connor condemned US support for counterrevolutionary guerrilla forces in Central America, opposed the U.S. mining of the waters off Nicaragua, questioned government spending on new weapons systems, and preached caution in regard to American military actions abroad.
* In 1998, O&#x27;Connor questioned whether the United States&#x27; cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan were morally justifiable. 
* In 1999, during the Kosovo War, O&#x27;Connor repeatedly challenged the morality of NATO&#x27;s bombing campaign of Yugoslavia, suggesting that it did not meet the Catholic Church&#x27;s criteria for a just war. At one point, he asked, &quot;Does the relentless bombing of Yugoslavia prove the power of the Western world or its weakness?&quot; 
* In 1998. O&#x27;Connor insisted that the traditional just war principles must be applied to evaluate the morality of military responses to unconventional warfare and terrorism.

===Organized labor===
In 1984, SEIU 1199, the largest health care workers union in New York City, went on strike against the League of Voluntary Hospitals, of which the archdiocesan hospitals were members. O&#x27;Connor strongly criticized the League for threatening to fire striking union members. He called it &quot;strikebreaking&quot; and vowed that no Catholic hospital would participate in such an action . After a year of stalled negotiations, O&#x27;Connor threatened to make a separate agreement with the SEIU 1199 &quot;that gives justice to the workers&quot;. In a Labor Day homily at St. Patrick&#x27;s in 1986, O&#x27;Connor said:&quot;[S]o many of our freedoms in this country, so much of the building up of society, is precisely attributable to the union movement, a movement that I personally will defend despite the weakness of some of its members, despite the corruption with which we are all familiar that pervades all society, a movement that I personally will defend with my life.&quot;In 1987, the television broadcast employees&#x27; union went on strike against the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). At one point, a non-union crew from NBC appeared at O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s residence to cover a press conference. O&#x27;Connor declined to admit them, directing his secretary to &quot;tell them they&#x27;re not invited.&quot;

Following O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death in 2002 , SEIU 1199 called him &quot;the patron saint of working people&quot;. It described his support for low-wage and other workers, his efforts in helping the limousine drivers unionize, his help in mediating a labor strike at &quot;The Daily News&quot;, and his pushing for fringe benefits for minimum-wage home health care workers.

===Relations with Jewish community===

* In 1987, Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel called O&#x27;Connor, &quot;a good Christian&quot; and a man &quot;who understands our pain.&quot;
* O&#x27;Connor in 1996 strongly denounced anti-Semitism, declaring that one &quot;cannot be a faithful Christian and an anti-Semite. They are incompatible, because anti-Semitism is a sin.&quot; He wrote an apology to Jewish leaders in New York City for past harm committed by the Catholic Church to the Jewish community.
* In 1998, O&#x27;Connor criticized the failure of Swiss banks to compensate Jewish Holocaust victims whose stolen assets had been deposited in Switzerland during World War II by German Nazi leaders. He called it &quot;a human rights issue, an issue of the human race.&quot; Even when disagreeing with him over political questions, Jewish leaders acknowledged that O&#x27;Connor was &quot;a friend, a powerful voice against anti-Semitism&quot;.
* The Jewish Council for Public Affairs in 2000 called O&#x27;Connor &quot;a true friend and champion of Catholic–Jewish relations, [and] a humanitarian who used the power of his pulpit to advocate for disadvantaged people throughout the world and in his own community.&quot;

===Relations with the LGBT community===
==== HIV/AIDS ====
In the early 1980s, O&#x27;Connor opened a specialized HIV/AIDS medical unit in St. Clare&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan, the first of its kind in the state. ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) protested in front of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in 1987, holding placards such as &quot;Cardinal O&#x27;Connor Loves Gay People ... If They Are Dying of AIDS.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor made an effort to minister to 1,000 people dying of HIV/AIDS and their families, following up on other HIV/AIDS patients. He visited Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center, where he cleaned the sores and emptied the bedpans of more than 1,100 patients. According to reports, O&#x27;Connor was popular with the Saint Vincent&#x27;s patients, many of whom did not know he was the archbishop, and was supportive of other priests who ministered to gay men and others with HIV/AIDS.

In 1987, US President Ronald Reagan appointed O&#x27;Connor to the President&#x27;s Commission on the HIV Epidemic, also known as the Watkins Commission. O&#x27;Connor served with 12 other members, few of whom were HIV/AIDS experts. HIV/AIDS researchers and activists initially criticized the commission members as lacking expertise on the disease and as being in disarray. The commission report in 1988 called for anti-bias laws to protect HIV-positive patients, on-demand treatment for those with substance abuse problems, and the speeding of HIV/AIDS-related research. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the commission&#x27;s &quot;remarkable strides&quot; and its proposed US$2 billion campaign against HIV/AIDS among drug users.

==== Hate crimes against LGBTQ ====
O&#x27;Connor led the 1990 funeral Mass at St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Staten Island for James Zappalorti, a murdered gay man. O&#x27;Connor later endorsed a statewide hate crime law that included crimes motivated by sexual orientation, which passed shortly after his own death in 2000.

==== Job discrimination against LGBTQ ====
O&#x27;Connor actively opposed an attempt by the City of New York to outlaw sexual discrimination by its contractors. In 1980, Mayor Ed Koch issued Executive Order 50, which required all city contractors, including religious entities, to provide services on a non-discriminatory basis with respect to race, creed, age, sex, handicap, as well as &quot;sexual orientation or preference&quot;.

When the city warned the Salvation Army that its contracts for child care services would be canceled if it failed to comply, the archdiocese threatened to cancel its contracts if given the same warning. O&#x27;Connor maintained that the executive order would cause the Catholic Church to appear to condone homosexual activity. Writing in &quot;Catholic New York&quot; in January 1985, O&#x27;Connor characterized the order as &quot;an exceedingly dangerous precedent [that would] invite unacceptable governmental intrusion into and excessive entanglement with the Church&#x27;s conducting of its own internal affairs.&quot; Drawing the traditional Catholic distinction between homosexual &quot;inclinations&quot; and &quot;behavior&quot;, he stated that &quot;we do not believe that homosexual behavior ... should be elevated to a protected category.&quot;

We do not believe that religious agencies should be required to employ those engaging in or advocating homosexual behavior. We are willing to consider on a case-by-case basis the employment of individuals who have engaged in or may at some future time engage in homosexual behavior. We approach those who have engaged in or may engage in what the Church considers illicit heterosexual behavior the same way. ...We believe, however, that only a religious agency itself can properly determine the requirements of any particular job within that agency, and whether or not a particular individual meets or is reasonably likely to meet such requirements.

After a protracted legal battle, the New York Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld lower court decisions striking down Executive Order 50.

O&#x27;Connor opposed city and state legislation guaranteeing LGBTQ civil rights, including legislation prohibiting discrimination based upon sexual orientation in housing, public accommodations and employment.

==== St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade and LGBTQ participation ====
O&#x27;Connor supported the 1993 decision by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which operated the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade in Manhattan, to bar the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization from marching under its own banner. The Hibernians argued that the First Amendment of the US Constitution protected their decision and that they could not be compelled to admit a group whose beliefs conflicted with theirs. The city subsequently denied the Hibernians a permit for the parade. However, in 1993, a federal judge in New York held that the city&#x27;s permit denial was &quot;patently unconstitutional&quot; because the parade was private, not public, and constituted &quot;a pristine form of speech&quot; as to which the parade sponsor had a right to control the content and tone.

In 1987, O&#x27;Connor prohibited DignityUSA, an organization of LGBTQ Catholics, from holding Masses in parishes in the archdiocese. After eight years of protests by the group, O&#x27;Connor started meeting with DignityUSA twice a year.

==== Condom use for HIV/AIDS prevention ====
O&#x27;Connor opposed condom distribution as an HIV/AIDS-prevention measure. He viewed condom use as contravening the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching that contraception is immoral and its use a sin. O&#x27;Connor rejected the argument that condoms distributed to gay men were not contraceptives. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s response was that using an &quot;evil act&quot; was not justified by good intentions, and that the church should not be seen as encouraging sinful acts among others (other fertile heterosexual couples who might wrongly interpret his narrow support as license for their own contraception).
O&#x27;Connor in 1993 stated that sexual abstinence is a sure way to prevent HIV/AIDs infection. He claimed condoms were only 50% effective against HIV transmission. HIV activist group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) criticized the cardinal&#x27;s opinion, leading to confrontations between the group and O&#x27;Connor.

===Theodore McCarrick===
In April 1986, O&#x27;Connor strongly endorsed the appointment of Theodore McCarrick, then bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen, as archbishop of the Archdiocese of Newark. However, In 1992 and 1993, O&#x27;Connor received several anonymous letters accusing McCarrick of sexually abusing seminarians, which he sent copies of to McCarrick. In 1994, before a papal visit by Pope John Paul II to the United States, the apostolic nuncio to the U.S., Cardinal Agostino Cacciavillan, became concerned about the pope visiting Newark, He had heard rumors that McCarrick had engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior in Newark with seminarians. O&#x27;Connor conducted an investigation for Cacciavillan and concluded that there were &quot;no impediments&quot; to visiting that city.

In October 1996, when two psychiatrists judged that a priest&#x27;s charge of sexual abuse by McCarrick was credible, O&#x27;Connor remained skeptical. That same month, however, he intervened to prevent a priest &quot;too closely identified&quot; with McCarrick from becoming an auxiliary bishop. O&#x27;Connor cited &quot;a rather unsettled climate of opinion about certain issues&quot; in Newark.

In October 1999, when John Paul II was considering transferring McCarrick to a more important archdiocese, O&#x27;Connor wrote a letter to the apostolic nuncio to the U.S. and the Congregation for Bishops. It summarized the charges against McCarrick, especially his repeatedly arrangement of seminarians and other men to share his bed, and concluded: &quot;I regret that I would have to recommend very strongly against such promotion.&quot; According to reports, the pope read the letter.

McCarrick learned about O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s letter from contacts in the Curia. In August 2000, several months after O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death, McCarrick sent a rebuttal to John Paul II, which allegedly convinced the pope to appoint him archbishop of Washington. McCarrick resigned from the College of Cardinals in 2018, and was defrocked in 2019.

<text>Jackanory was a BBC children&#x27;s television series which was originally broadcast between 1965 and 1996. It was designed to stimulate an interest in reading. The programme was first transmitted on 13 December 1965, and the first story was the fairy-tale &quot;Cap-o&#x27;-Rushes&quot; read by Lee Montague. &quot;Jackanory&quot; was broadcast until 1996, with around 3,500 episodes in its 30-year run.

The final story, &quot;The House at Pooh Corner&quot; by A. A. Milne, was read by Alan Bennett and broadcast on 24 March 1996. The programme was briefly revived on 27 November 2006 for two one-off stories. The format was revived as Jackanory Junior, airing on CBeebies between 2007 and 2009.

The programme&#x27;s format, which varied little over the decades, featured an actor reading from children&#x27;s novels or folk tales, usually while seated in an armchair. From time to time the scene being read would be illustrated by a specially commissioned still drawing, often by Quentin Blake. In 1983, Malou Bonicos was commissioned to provide illustrations for one &quot;Jackanory&quot; story. Usually a single book would occupy five daily fifteen-minute episodes, from Monday to Friday.

A spin-off series was &quot;Jackanory Playhouse&quot; (1972–85), which was a series of thirty-minute dramatisations. These included a dramatisation by Philip Glassborow of the comical A. A. Milne story &quot;The Princess Who Couldn&#x27;t Laugh&quot;.

Coverage of the live broadcast of the Apollo 8 mission in 1968 was interrupted so &quot;Jackanory&quot; could be shown.

==Title==
The programme&#x27;s title comes from an old English nursery rhyme:

The rhyme was first recorded in the publication &quot;The Top Book of All, for little Masters and Misses&quot;, which appeared about 1760.

==Revival==

In November 2006 &quot;Jackanory&quot; briefly returned with the late comedian John Sessions as the revived programme&#x27;s first narrator reading the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; parody &quot;Muddle Earth&quot;, written by Paul Stewart (and illustrator Chris Riddell). The second narrator was Sir Ben Kingsley, reading &quot;The Magician of Samarkand&quot; by Alan Temperley. They were broadcast in three 15-minute slots on CBBC and BBC One and later repeated in their entirety on BBC One on consecutive Sundays. The readings of &quot;Muddle Earth&quot; were heavily accompanied by animation and featured John Sessions speaking the lines of all the animated characters (and occasionally reading those of Joe whenever he was not on-screen), leading to criticism that the spirit of the original programme, a single voice telling a tale with minimal distractions, had been lost. (The original series had occasionally included dramatised material, in e.g. 1984&#x27;s &quot;Starstormers&quot; by Nicholas Fisk and increasingly so towards the end of its run in 1996). &quot;The Magician of Samarkand&quot; was a similar production, albeit without the actors speaking additional lines; Ben Kingsley read both the story and the lines of all the characters. Both of these stories were produced and directed by Nick Willing.

Both stories were released in their entirety on DVD later that year, with added bonus features (galleries with images from the stories and a behind-the-scenes film for &quot;Muddle Earth&quot;).

While no further stories were made, &quot;Muddle Earth&quot; would be adapted for television again a few years later.

==&quot;Jackanory Junior&quot;==
A version of &quot;Jackanory&quot; for younger children—called Jackanory Junior—was shown on CBeebies between 2007 and 2009. The &quot;CBeebies Bedtime Stories&quot; strand continues the tradition of well-known actors and personalities reading stories directly to camera.

==Cultural influence==

Philip Glenister, in character as Gene Hunt, made an appearance on &quot;Jackanory&quot; as the guest reader in the &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; series 2 finale, set in 1982, which Alex Drake (Keeley Hawes) imagines being transmitted to her television set.

&quot;Jackanory Stories&quot; by Television Personalities, a track in the &quot;... And Don&#x27;t the Kids Just Love It&quot; album.

&quot;Jackanory, jackanory&quot; said by someone in the sing-song tones of the theme tune indicates that they think that someone else is making up or &quot;stretching&quot; a story, i.e. lying.

In 2013 the UK TV Network Dave launched &quot;Crackanory&quot; as an adult version of Jackanory. Each &quot;Crackanory&quot; episode features two 15-minute tales narrated by contemporary comedians and actors, containing a mix of live-action and animation as per the original.

<doc id="244351" wikidata="Q24307" url="?curid=244351" title="Korematsu v. United States">
<text>Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that upheld the internment of Japanese Americans from the West Coast Military Area during World War II. The decision has been widely criticized, with some scholars describing it as &quot;an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry&quot;, and as &quot;a stain on American jurisprudence&quot;. The case is often cited as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time. Chief Justice John Roberts repudiated the &quot;Korematsu&quot; decision in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot;.

In the aftermath of Imperial Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the U.S. War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded. Subsequently, the Western Defense Command, a U.S. Army military command charged with coordinating the defense of the West Coast of the United States, ordered &quot;all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens&quot; to relocate to internment camps. However, a 23-year-old Japanese-American man, Fred Korematsu, refused to leave the exclusion zone and instead challenged the order on the grounds that it violated the Fifth Amendment.

In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Associate Justice Hugo Black held that the need to protect against espionage by Japan outweighed the rights of Americans of Japanese ancestry. Black wrote that &quot;Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race&quot;, but rather &quot;because the properly constituted military authorities...decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast&quot; during the war against Japan. Dissenting justices Frank Murphy, Robert H. Jackson, and Owen J. Roberts all criticized the exclusion as racially discriminatory; Murphy wrote that the exclusion of Japanese &quot;falls into the ugly abyss of racism&quot; and resembled &quot;the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy.&quot;

The &quot;Korematsu&quot; opinion was the first instance in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard of review to racial discrimination by the government; it is one of only a handful of cases in which the Court held that the government met this standard. Korematsu&#x27;s conviction was voided by a California district court in 1983 on the grounds that Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy had suppressed a report from the Office of Naval Intelligence which stated there was no evidence that Japanese Americans were acting as spies for Japan. The Japanese-Americans who were interned were later granted reparations through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.

==Background==

In the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the report of the First Roberts Commission, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the War Department to create military areas from which any or all Americans might be excluded, and to provide for the necessary transport, lodging, and feeding of persons displaced from such areas. On March 2, 1942, the U.S. Army Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense Command, issued Public Proclamation No. 1, demarcating western military areas and the exclusion zones therein, and directing any &quot;Japanese, German, or Italian aliens&quot; and any person of Japanese ancestry to inform the U.S. Postal Service of any changes of residence. Further military areas and zones were demarcated in Public Proclamation No. 2.

In the meantime, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson mailed to Senator Robert Rice Reynolds and House Speaker Sam Rayburn draft legislation authorizing the enforcement of Executive Order 9066. By March 21, Congress had enacted the proposed legislation, which Roosevelt signed into law. On March 24, 1942, Western Defense Command began issuing Civilian Exclusion orders, commanding &quot;all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens&quot; report to designated assembly points. With the issuance of Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1 on May 19, 1942, Japanese Americans were forced to move into relocation camps.

Meanwhile, Fred Korematsu was a 23-year-old Japanese-American man who decided to stay at his residence in San Leandro, California, instead of obeying the order to relocate; however, he knowingly violated Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the U.S. Army, even undergoing plastic surgery in an attempt to conceal his identity. Korematsu argued that Executive Order 9066 violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and was thus unconstitutional. The Fifth Amendment was selected over the Fourteenth Amendment due to the lack of federal protections in the Fourteenth Amendment. He was arrested and convicted. No question was raised as to Korematsu&#x27;s loyalty to the United States. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit eventually affirmed his conviction, and the Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot;.

==Decision==
===Black&#x27;s majority opinion===

The decision of the case, written by Justice Hugo Black, found the case largely indistinguishable from the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot; decision, and rested largely on the same principle: deference to Congress and the military authorities, particularly in light of the uncertainty following Pearl Harbor. Justice Black further denied that the case had anything to do with racial prejudice:Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures, because they decided that the military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast temporarily, and, finally, because Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our military leaders—as inevitably it must—determined that they should have the power to do just this.

In his diaries, Justice Felix Frankfurter reported that Justice Black told the justices as reason for deferring to the executive branch: &quot;Somebody must run this war. It is either Roosevelt or us. And we cannot.&quot;

While &quot;Korematsu&quot; is regularly described as upholding the internment of Japanese Americans, the majority opinion expressly declined to reach the issue of internment on the ground that Korematsu&#x27;s conviction did not present that issue, which it said raised different questions. The Court cross-referenced its decision the same day in &quot;Ex Parte Endo&quot;, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), in which the Court ruled that a loyal Japanese American must be released from detention.

===Frankfurter&#x27;s concurrence===
Justice Frankfurter&#x27;s concurrence reads in its entirety:
:According to my reading of Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, it was an offense for Korematsu to be found in Military Area No. 1, the territory wherein he was previously living, except within the bounds of the established Assembly Center of that area. Even though the various orders issued by General DeWitt be deemed a comprehensive code of instructions, their tenor is clear, and not contradictory. They put upon Korematsu the obligation to leave Military Area No. 1, but only by the method prescribed in the instructions, i.e., by reporting to the Assembly Center. I am unable to see how the legal considerations that led to the decision in &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot;, 320 U.S. 81, fail to sustain the military order which made the conduct now in controversy a crime. And so I join in the opinion of the Court, but should like to add a few words of my own.
:The provisions of the Constitution which confer on the Congress and the President powers to enable this country to wage war are as much part of the Constitution as provisions looking to a nation at peace. And we have had recent occasion to quote approvingly the statement of former Chief Justice Hughes that the war power of the Government is &quot;the power to wage war successfully&quot;. &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot;, supra, at 93, and see &quot;Home Bldg. &amp; L. Assn. v. Blaisdell&quot;, 290 U.S. 398, 426. Therefore, the validity of action under the war power must be judged wholly in the context of war. That action is not to be stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless. To talk about a military order that expresses an allowable judgment of war needs by those entrusted with the duty of conducting war as &quot;an [p. 225] unconstitutional order&quot; is to suffuse a part of the Constitution with an atmosphere of unconstitutionality. The respective spheres of action of military authorities and of judges are, of course, very different. But, within their sphere, military authorities are no more outside the bounds of obedience to the Constitution than are judges within theirs. &quot;The war power of the United States, like its other powers... is subject to applicable constitutional limitations&quot;, &quot;Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co.&quot;, 251 U.S. 146, 156. To recognize that military orders are &quot;reasonably expedient military precautions&quot; in time of war, and yet to deny them constitutional legitimacy, makes of the Constitution an instrument for dialectic subtleties not reasonably to be attributed to the hard-headed Framers, of whom a majority had had actual participation in war. If a military order such as that under review does not transcend the means appropriate for conducting war, such action by the military is as constitutional as would be any authorized action by the Interstate Commerce Commission within the limits of the constitutional power to regulate commerce. And, being an exercise of the war power explicitly granted by the Constitution for safeguarding the national life by prosecuting war effectively, I find nothing in the Constitution which denies to Congress the power to enforce such a valid military order by making its violation an offense triable in the civil courts. Compare &quot;Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson&quot;, 154 U.S. 447; 155 U.S. 3, and &quot;Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States&quot;, 216 U.S. 177. To find that the Constitution does not forbid the military measures now complained of does not carry with it approval of that which Congress and the Executive did. That is their business, not ours.

===Murphy&#x27;s dissent===

Justice Frank Murphy issued a vehement dissent, saying that the exclusion of Japanese &quot;falls into the ugly abyss of racism&quot;, and resembles &quot;the abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy.&quot; Murphy argued that collective punishment for Japanese Americans was an unconstitutional response to any disloyalty that might have been found in a minority of their cohort. He also compared the treatment of Japanese Americans with the treatment of Americans of German and Italian ancestry, as evidence that race, and not emergency alone, led to the exclusion order which Korematsu was convicted of violating:I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in any setting, but it is utterly revolting among a free people who have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of the United States. All residents of this nation are kin in some way by blood or culture to a foreign land. Yet they are primarily and necessarily a part of the new and distinct civilization of the United States. They must, accordingly, be treated at all times as the heirs of the American experiment, and as entitled to all the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.

Justice Murphy&#x27;s two uses of the term &quot;racism&quot; in this opinion, along with two additional uses in his concurrence in &quot;Steele v. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railway Co.&quot;, decided the same day, are among the first appearances of the word &quot;racism&quot; in a United States Supreme Court opinion. The first appearance was in Justice Murphy&#x27;s concurrence in . The term was also used in other cases, such as and . It then disappeared from the court&#x27;s lexicon for 18 years before reappearing in .

Justice Murphy&#x27;s dissent is considered the strongest of the three dissenting opinions and, since the 1980s, has been cited as part of modern jurisprudence&#x27;s categorical rejection of the majority opinion.

===Roberts&#x27;s dissent===
Justice Roberts&#x27;s dissent also acknowledges the racism inherent in the case although he does not use the word. He recognized that the defendant was being punished based solely upon his ancestry:This is not a case of keeping people off the streets at night, as was &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot;, 320 U.S. 81, [p. 226] nor a case of temporary exclusion of a citizen from an area for his own safety or that of the community, nor a case of offering him an opportunity to go temporarily out of an area where his presence might cause danger to himself or to his fellows. On the contrary, it is the case of convicting a citizen as a punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. If this be a correct statement of the facts disclosed by this record, and facts of which we take judicial notice, I need hardly labor the conclusion that Constitutional rights have been violated.

===Jackson&#x27;s dissent===
By contrast, Justice Robert Jackson&#x27;s dissent argued that &quot;defense measures will not, and often should not, be held within the limits that bind civil authority in peace&quot;, and that it would perhaps be unreasonable to hold the military, who issued the exclusion order, to the same standards of constitutionality that apply to the rest of the government. &quot;In the very nature of things&quot;, he wrote, &quot;military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent judicial appraisal.&quot; He acknowledged the Court&#x27;s powerlessness in that regard, writing that &quot;courts can never have any real alternative to accepting the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint.&quot;

He nonetheless dissented, writing that, even if the courts should not be put in the position of second-guessing or interfering with the orders of military commanders, that does not mean that they should have to ratify or enforce those orders if they are unconstitutional. Jackson writes, &quot;I do not think [the civil courts] may be asked to execute a military expedient that has no place in law under the Constitution. I would reverse the judgment and discharge the prisoner.&quot; Indeed, he warns that the precedent of &quot;Korematsu&quot; might last well beyond the war and the internment:A military order, however unconstitutional, is not apt to last longer than the military emergency. Even during that period, a succeeding commander may revoke it all. But once a judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the Court for all time has validated the principle of racial discrimination in criminal procedure and of transplanting American citizens. The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new purposes.

Jackson further warned:Of course the existence of a military power resting on force, so vagrant, so centralized, so necessarily heedless of the individual, is an inherent threat to liberty. But I would not lead people to rely on this Court for a review that seems to me wholly delusive. The military reasonableness of these orders can only be determined by military superiors. If the people ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous hands, the courts wield no power equal to its restraint. The chief restraint upon those who command the physical forces of the country, in the future as in the past, must be their responsibility to the political judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments of history.

Jackson acknowledged the racial issues at hand, writing:Korematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a citizen of the United States by nativity and a citizen of California by residence. No claim is made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter involved here he is not law abiding and well disposed. Korematsu, however, has been convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived. [...] [H]is crime would result, not from anything he did, said, or thought, different than they, but only in that he was born of different racial stock. Now, if any fundamental assumption underlies our system, it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable. Even if all of one&#x27;s antecedents had been convicted of treason, the Constitution forbids its penalties to be visited upon him. But here is an attempt to make an otherwise innocent act a crime merely because this prisoner is the son of parents as to whom he had no choice, and belongs to a race from which there is no way to resign. If Congress in peace-time legislation should enact such a criminal law, I should suppose this Court would refuse to enforce it.

==Subsequent history==
===Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians===
In 1980, Congress established a commission to evaluate the events leading up to the issuance of Executive Order 9066 and accompanying military directives and their impact on citizens and resident aliens, charging the commission with recommending remedies. Discussing the &quot;Korematsu&quot; decision in their 1982 report entitled &quot;Personal Justice Denied&quot;, this Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CCWRIC) concluded that &quot;each part of the decision, questions of both factual review and legal principles, has been discredited or abandoned,&quot; and that, &quot;Today the decision in &quot;Korematsu&quot; lies overruled in the court of history.&quot;

===Conviction overturned===

Korematsu challenged his conviction in 1983 by filing before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, which asserted that the original conviction was so flawed as to represent a grave injustice that should be reversed. As evidence, he submitted the conclusions of the CCWRIC report as well as newly discovered internal Justice Department communications demonstrating that evidence contradicting the military necessity for the Executive Order 9066 had been knowingly withheld from the Supreme Court. Specifically, he said Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy had kept from the Court a wartime finding by the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Ringle Report, that concluded very few Japanese represented a risk and that almost all of those who did were already in custody when the Executive Order was enacted. While not admitting error, the government submitted a counter-motion asking the court to vacate the conviction without a finding of fact on its merits. Judge Marilyn Hall Patel denied the government&#x27;s petition, and concluded that the Supreme Court had indeed been given a selective record, representing a compelling circumstance sufficient to overturn the original conviction. She granted the writ, thereby voiding Korematsu&#x27;s conviction, while pointing out that since this decision was based on prosecutorial misconduct and not an error of law, any legal precedent established by the case remained in force.

===2011 DOJ admission of error===
On May 20, 2011, Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal released an unusual statement denouncing one of his predecessors, Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy. He faulted Fahy for having &quot;suppressed critical evidence&quot; in the &quot;Hirabayashi&quot; and &quot;Korematsu&quot; cases before the Supreme Court during World War II, specifically the Ringle Report&#x27;s conclusion that there was no indication Japanese Americans were acting as spies or sending signals to enemy submarines. The rulings in the 1980s that overturned the convictions of Korematsu and Hirabayashi concluded that failure to disclose the Ringle Report, along with an initial report by General De Witt that demonstrated racist motivations behind the military orders, represented a fatal flaw in the prosecution of their cases before the Supreme Court. Katyal noted that Justice Department attorneys had actually alerted Fahy that failing to disclose the Ringle Report&#x27;s existence in the briefs or argument in the Supreme Court &quot;might approximate the suppression of evidence&quot;. Thus, Katyal concluded that Fahy &quot;did not inform the Court that a key set of allegations used to justify the internment&quot; had been doubted, if not fully discredited, within the government&#x27;s own agencies.

Katyal therefore announced his office&#x27;s filing of a formal &quot;admission of error&quot;. He reaffirmed the extraordinary duty of the Solicitor General to address the Court with &quot;absolute candor,&quot; due to the &quot;special credence&quot; the Court explicitly grants to his court submissions.

===21st-century reactions===
Eleven lawyers who had represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter dated January 13, 2014, to Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. In light of the appeal proceedings before the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Hedges v. Obama&quot;, the lawyers asked Verrilli to ask the Supreme Court to overrule its decisions in &quot;Korematsu&quot;, &quot;Hirabayashi&quot; (1943), and &quot;Yasui&quot; (1943). If the Solicitor General shouldn&#x27;t do this, they asked that the United States government to &quot;make clear&quot; that the federal government &quot;does not consider the internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of individuals or groups without due process of law [...].&quot;

On February 3, 2014, Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion with law students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa William S. Richardson School of Law, warned that &quot;the Supreme Court&#x27;s Korematsu decision upholding the internment of Japanese Americans was wrong, but it could happen again in war time.&quot; In October 2015 at Santa Clara University, Scalia told law students that Justice Jackson&#x27;s dissenting opinion in &quot;Korematsu&quot; was the past court opinion he admired most, adding &quot;It was nice to know that at least somebody on the court realized that that was wrong.&quot;

Donald Trump&#x27;s Presidential election led Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to advocate for Trump to implement immigration controls like the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. One Trump supporter, Carl Higbie, said that Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1980 restriction on Iranian immigration, as well as the &quot;Korematsu&quot; decision, gives legal precedent for a registry of immigrants. Critics of Higbie argued that &quot;Korematsu&quot; should not be referenced as precedent. Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein argued that the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 granting reparations to the Japanese Americans who were interned amounts to &quot;Korematsu&quot; having been overturned by history—outside of a potential formal Supreme Court overrule. Another critic of Higbie described &quot;Korematsu&quot; as a &quot;stain on American jurisprudence&quot;.

According to Harvard University&#x27;s Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Noah Feldman, &quot;a decision can be wrong at the very moment it was decided—and therefore should not be followed subsequently.&quot; Justice Anthony Kennedy applied this approach in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; to overturn &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; and thereby strike down anti-sodomy laws in 14 states. The implication is that decisions which are wrong when decided should not be followed even before the Court reverses itself, and &quot;Korematsu&quot; has probably the greatest claim to being wrong when decided of any case which still stood. Legal scholar Richard Primus applied the term &quot;Anti-Canon&quot; to cases which are &quot;universally assailed as wrong, immoral, and unconstitutional&quot; and have become exemplars of faulty legal reasoning. &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; is one such example, and &quot;Korematsu&quot; has joined this group—as Feldman then put it, &quot;&quot;Korematsu&quot;″s uniquely bad legal status means it&#x27;s not precedent even though it hasn&#x27;t been overturned.&quot; Laurence Tribe points out that even in &quot;Korematsu&quot; the Court states in dictum that &quot;racial antagonism&quot; can not justify a racial classification that restricts civil rights.

=== Rejection in &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot; (2018) ===

Chief Justice Roberts, in writing the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot; (2018), stated that &quot;Korematsu&quot; was wrongly decided, essentially disavowing the decision and indicating that a majority of the court no longer finds &quot;Korematsu&quot; persuasive. Quoting Justice Robert H. Jackson&#x27;s dissent from &quot;Korematsu&quot;, the Chief Justice stated:

Roberts also added: &quot;The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority.&quot; Congress regards &quot;Korematsu&quot; as having been overruled by &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot;.

=== Rejection in dissent of &quot;United States v. Zubaydah&quot; ===
Justice Gorsuch, writing in his dissent of &quot;United States v. Zubaydah&quot;, reiterated the fact that &quot;Korematsu&quot; was negligent. Gorsuch criticised the court for allowing &quot;state interest&quot; as a justification for &quot;suppressing judicial proceedings in the name of national security.&quot; He used &quot;Korematsu&quot; as a justification against doing such.

Justice Gorsuch dissented stating: 
=== Confirmation of overturning in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; ===
Chief Justice Roberts, in writing the majority opinion of the Supreme Court in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot;, which held that affirmative action programs violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, stated in a footnote that the Court had overturned &quot;Korematsu&quot; in 2018, stating:

<text>Terence James Cooke (March 1, 1921 – October 6, 1983) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of New York from 1968 until his death, quietly battling leukemia throughout his tenure. He was named a cardinal in 1969. Cooke previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1965 to 1967.

Nine years after his death, Cooke was designated a Servant of God, the first step in the process that may lead to beatification and then canonization as a saint.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
The youngest of three children, Terence Cooke was born in New York City to Michael and Margaret (née Gannon) Cooke. His parents were both from County Galway, Ireland, and named their son after Terence MacSwiney, the Lord Mayor of Cork who died on a hunger strike during the Irish War of Independence. Michael Cooke worked as a chauffeur and construction worker. At age five, Terence and his family moved from Morningside Heights, Manhattan, to the northeast Bronx. Following his mother&#x27;s death in 1930, his aunt Mary Gannon helped raise him and his siblings.

After expressing an early interest in the priesthood, in 1934 Cooke entered Manhattan&#x27;s Cathedral College, the minor seminary of the Archdiocese of New York. In 1940, he entered St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers, New York.

=== Ministry ===
Cooke was ordained a priest by Archbishop Francis Spellman on December 1, 1945. Cooke then served as chaplain for St. Agatha&#x27;s Home for Children in Nanuet, New York, until 1947, when he moved to Washington, D.C., to pursue graduate studies at The Catholic University of America. He obtained a Master of Social Work degree in 1949.

When he returned to New York, Cooke was assigned to serve as a curate at St. Athanasius Parish in the Bronx, while working with the Catholic Youth Organization. In 1954 he was appointed executive director of the Youth Division of Catholic Charities and of St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary. In 1957 he was appointed by Cardinal Spellman to be his secretary, a position he held until 1965. Cooke was named a monsignor on August 13, 1957, and vice-chancellor for the archdiocese in 1958, rising to full chancellor in 1961.

=== Auxiliary Bishop of New York ===
On September 15, 1965, Pope Paul VI appointed Cooke as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York and titular bishop of Summa. He received his episcopal consecration on December 13, 1965 from Cardinal Spellman at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, with Archbishops Joseph McGucken and John Maguire serving as co-consecrators. Cooke selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;Fiat Voluntas Tua&quot;, meaning, &quot;Thy Will Be Done&quot; from Luke 1:38.

Cooke played a prominent role in arranging Pope Paul&#x27;s visit to New York in October 1965, and became Vicar General of the Archdiocese two days after his consecration, on December 15, 1965. He was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, a form of cancer, that year as well.

=== Archbishop of New York ===
Following Spellman&#x27;s death in December 1967, Pope Paul named Cooke as the seventh Archbishop of New York on March 2, 1968.

Pope Paul&#x27;s selection of Cooke came as a surprise; likely contenders for the post included Fulton J. Sheen, a television personality and Bishop of Rochester; and Archbishop Maguire, who had been Spellman&#x27;s coadjutor. In addition to his duties in New York, Cooke was named Vicar Apostolic for the U.S. Military on April 4, 1968 and was installed in both positions at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

That same day as Cooke&#x27;s installation, the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, leading to a nationwide wave of riots in more than 100 cities. Cooke went to Harlem that evening to plead for racial peace and later attended King&#x27;s funeral. After the assassination of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on June 6, 1968, Cooke led the funeral at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral; months later, he baptized Kennedy&#x27;s youngest child, Rory Kennedy.

On January 20, 1969, Cooke delivered the benediction at the inauguration of President Richard Nixon.

After the first meeting between Church and Freemasonry, which had been held on April 11, 1969 at the convent of the Divine Master in Ariccia, he was the protagonist of a series of public handshakes between high prelates of the Roman Catholic Church and the heads of Freemasonry.

Cooke helped implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the archdiocese, and adopted a more collegial management style than his predecessor Spellman. Pope Paul VI appointed him as Cardinal-Priest of &quot;Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Rome&quot; (the traditional titular church of the New York archbishops starting in 1946) in the consistory of April 28, 1969. At the time of his elevation, Cooke was the second-youngest member of the College of Cardinals after Cardinal Alfred Bengsch, who was six months younger. Cooke was theologically conservative but described himself as progressive in secular matters.

During his tenure as archbishop, Cooke founded the Birthright organization, which provides counseling and other support for pregnant women; the Inner-City Scholarship Fund, which provides financial aid for Catholic-school students; an Archdiocesan Housing Development Program, providing housing to New York&#x27;s disadvantaged; &quot;Catholic New York&quot;, the archdiocesan newspaper; and nine nursing homes. In 1974, Cooke went to the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he attended lectures on the Second Vatican Council given by his future successor, Father Edward Egan.

Cooke was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Popes John Paul I and John Paul II, respectively. In 1979, Cooke separately hosted the Dalai Lama and Pope John Paul II at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

=== Death ===
Cooke&#x27;s leukemia, first diagnosed in 1965, was deemed terminal in 1975, and he was on almost constant chemotherapy for the last five years of his life. In late August 1983, he announced his illness to the public, saying that he was expected to live for a few more months but would not resign his post. In an open letter completed only days before his death, he wrote, &quot;The gift of life, God&#x27;s special gift, is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by illness or weakness, hunger or poverty, mental or physical handicaps, loneliness or old age.&quot;

On October 6, 1983, Cooke died from leukemia at age 62 at his episcopal residence in Manhattan, New York City. He is interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

== Legacy ==
On April 5, 1984, President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Cooke the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 1988, he posthumously received the F. Sadlier Dinger Award from the publisher William H. Sadlier, Inc., for his contributions to religious education.

=== Recognition ===
During his years as archbishop, Cooke received honorary degrees from at least four Catholic colleges: College of New Rochelle (1968), College of Mount Saint Vincent (1968), Boston College (1969), and Marymount Manhattan College (1978). He also received the James Cardinal Gibbons Medal (1979) from his alma mater, Catholic University of America.

At least seven buildings in the Archdiocese of New York have been named in his honor:
* Terence Cardinal Cooke Catholic Center (archdiocesan headquarters, in Manhattan)
* Terence Cardinal Cooke–Cathedral Library (now part of New York Public Library, Manhattan)
* Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center (Manhattan)
* Cooke School and Institute (special needs, Manhattan)
* Cardinal Cooke Residence (special needs, Bronx)
* Cardinal Cooke Residence (emergency home for mothers, Spring Valley)
* Cardinal Cooke Center (parish hall, Staten Island)

=== Cause for canonization ===
Soon after Cooke died in 1983, a movement emerged to canonize him as a saint. In 1984, with the support of Cooke&#x27;s successor, Archbishop (and future cardinal) John O&#x27;Connor, the Cardinal Cooke Guild was established. In 1992, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints officially designated Cooke as a Servant of God, the first step in the process that leads to beatification and then canonization as a saint. On April 14, 2010, the Guild and senior American clergy presented Pope Benedict XVI with the &quot;positio&quot;, the documentation of the cardinal&#x27;s life, work, and virtues. The document was then filed with the Congregation for Causes, to be examined by theologians. If the document is approved, Cooke will receive the title of Venerable, the second step leading to sainthood.

Father Benedict Groeschel was the postulator for the cause while it was in its initial stages in New York. After the process was accepted by the Holy See, Andrea Ambrosi served as postulator until his retirement in 2021. He was replaced by Dr. Angelica Ambrosi. As of January 22, 2022, the canonization process is still ongoing.

==Views==

=== Foreign relations ===
An anti-Communist, Cooke opposed the majority of his fellow bishops when he spoke out against nuclear disarmament in 1982. He once stated that deterrence was not satisfactory or safe, but could be considered morally &quot;tolerable&quot;. During a 1968 Central Park anti-war rally by Coretta Scott King he organized a small counter demonstration in support of the Vietnam War.

Cooke, opposed to the militant policies of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, remained inside St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral during the 1983 St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, until the grand marshal, Irish activist Michael Flannery, had passed by. Flannery was an outspoken supporter of the IRA.

=== Abortion rights ===
Cooke was an outspoken opponent of abortion rights, which he called the &quot;slaughter of the innocent unborn&quot;, and once served as chairman of the USCCB&#x27;s Pro-Life Committee.

=== LGBT rights ===
Cooke initiated the formation of Courage International, a ministry that promotes chastity for gay and lesbian Catholics.

=== Traditional values ===
Cooke supported the Cursillo Movement, Christian Family Movement, and Charismatic Renewal, and was instrumental in bringing the Missionaries of Charity to New York. Cooke once described actress-turned-princess Grace Kelly as &quot;a lesson in Catholic motherhood&quot;.

<doc id="244354" wikidata="Q5578869" url="?curid=244354" title="American Gold Star Mothers">
<text>American Gold Star Mothers, Inc. (AGSM), is a private nonprofit organization of American mothers who lost sons or daughters in service of the United States Armed Forces. It was originally formed in 1928 for mothers of those lost in World War I, and it holds a congressional charter under Title 36 § 211 of the United States Code. Its name came from the custom of families of servicemen hanging a banner called a service flag in the windows of their homes. The service flag had a star for each family member in the Armed Forces. Living servicemen were represented by a blue star, and those who had lost their lives in combat were represented by a gold star.

Membership in the organization is open to any woman who is a U.S. citizen or legal resident that has lost a son or daughter in active service in the U.S. military (regardless of the place or time of the military service, regardless of whether the circumstances of death involved hostile conflict or not, and including mothers of those missing in action).

==Founding==
The Gold Star Mothers was founded by Grace Darling Seibold of Washington, D.C.

When the United States entered World War I in 1917, George Vaughn Seibold, 23, volunteered, requesting assignment in aviation. He was sent to Canada where he learned to fly British planes since the United States had neither an air force nor planes. Deployed to England, he was assigned to the British Royal Flying Corps with 148th Aero Squadron. With his squadron, he left for combat duty in France. He corresponded with his family regularly. His mother, Grace Darling Seibold, began to do community service by visiting returning servicemen in the hospitals. When mail from George stopped Grace assumed the worst and wrote the Army for assistance finding her son. Since all aviators were under British control and authority, the United States could not help the Seibold family with any information about their son.

Grace continued to visit hospitalized veterans in the Washington area, clinging to the hope that her son might have been injured and returned to the United States without any identification. While working through her sorrow, she helped ease the pain of the many servicemen who returned so war-damaged that they were incapable of ever reaching normalcy.

But on October 11, 1918, George&#x27;s wife in Chicago received a box marked &quot;Effects of deceased Officer 1st Lt. George Vaughn Seibold&quot;. The Seibolds also received a confirmation of George&#x27;s death on November 4 through a family member in Paris. George&#x27;s body was never identified.

Grace, convinced that self-contained grief is self-destructive, devoted her time and efforts not only to working in the hospital but also to supporting other mothers whose sons had lost their lives in military service. She organized a group consisting solely of these mothers, with the purpose of not only comforting each other, but giving loving care to hospitalized veterans confined in government hospitals far from home. The organization was named after the Gold Star that families hung in their windows in honor of the deceased veteran. After years of planning, twenty-five mothers met in Washington, D.C., on June 4, 1928, to establish the national organization, American Gold Star Mothers, Inc.

== Origin of Gold Star Symbol ==
On May 28, 1918, President Woodrow Wilson approved a suggestion made by the Council of National Defense that, instead of wearing conventional mourning for relatives who have died in the service of their country, American women should wear a black band on the left arm with a gilt star on the band for each member of the family who has given his life for the nation.

&quot;The Service Flag displayed from homes, places of business, churches, schools, etc., to indicate the number of members of the family or organizations who are serving in the Armed Forces or who have died from such service. Service flags have a deep Blue Star for each living member in the service and a Gold Star for each member who has died.&quot; Thus, the Gold Star and the term Gold Star Mother, as applied to mothers whose sons or daughters died in World War I, were accepted; they have continued to be used in reference to all American military engagements since that time.

The United States also assisted its citizens who were Gold Star Mothers to visit the overseas graves of their sons, as well as for widows of the fallen. In 1929 the program was expanded to include non-U.S. citizens. It ended in 1933. Named medals were also presented to those who made a pilgrimage.

==History of membership criteria==
Membership in American Gold Star Mothers was originally restricted to those who lost sons or daughters in World War I, and was later expanded to include mothers of those lost in World War II, then the Korean War, and then other specific conflicts. Today, the membership criteria do not consider the place or time of the military service and do not consider whether the circumstances of the death involved hostile conflict or not, and also allow membership for mothers of those missing in action.

For the first 77 years of its existence, AGSM restricted its membership criteria to admit only U.S. citizens. As a way to create pressure to change the rule, an application for admission was submitted in 2005 that deliberately highlighted the applicant&#x27;s lack of citizenship. The application, from Ligaya Lagman, a Filipino permanent resident of the United States living in Yonkers, New York, who had been living in the U.S. more than 20 years and whose son, Marine Staff Sgt. Anthony Lagman, was killed in action in Afghanistan in 2004 at the age of 26, was rejected in May 2005. In the next month after that incident, which received a &quot;firestorm&quot; of publicity that included negative commentary by New York U.S. Representative Eliot Engel and New York U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the group agreed on June 27, 2005, to change its membership criteria, and it accepted its first two non-citizens as members a few months later in early September 2005.

==Current membership and charter==

The AGSM is a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that sets its own rules for who is allowed to become a member. The current charter, held under Title 36 § 211 of the United States Code, was established on June 12, 1984.

Today, membership in American Gold Star Mothers is open to any woman who was a U.S. citizen or legal resident of the U.S. or its Territories or Insular Possessions at the time their child (or adopted child) was inducted into military service and whose child (or adopted child) has died or has become missing in action while in the United States Armed Forces (or died later as the result of such service). Membership is not contingent on whether the child was killed in action or on the theater of operation or the time period of the service (which differs from distinctions made by the Department of Defense, which confers special status to service in particular periods of time and particular hostile operations). Non-adoptive stepmothers are also eligible for membership if they assumed responsibility for the child before the age of fifteen and raised them. Husbands and children of Gold Star Mothers are eligible to join as Associate Members. Honorary membership is available to mothers who were not citizens or legal residents at the time their child was inducted. Associate Members and Honorary Members cannot vote or hold official positions (and are not required to pay dues).

AGSM is made up of local chapters, which are organized into departments. Five members are required to start a local chapter. If no local chapter is available, a woman may join the organization as a member at large.

Just as when it was founded, AGSM continues to concentrate on providing emotional support to its members, doing volunteer work with veterans in general and veterans&#x27; hospitals in particular, and generally fostering a sense of patriotism and respect for members of the Armed Forces.

==Uniform==
The uniform consists of a white skirt, white shirt, and a white blazer, with a gold star embroidered on either lapel, and gold piping on the sleeve cuffs, and collars, and white shoes, either Mary Janes or pumps, with a white cap, similar to a women&#x27;s service hat, with gold piping. This uniform is worn at all parades, meetings, and social functions connected with military functions (e.g., Memorial Day services at Arlington National Cemetery)

==Notable memberships==
Aside from the founder, perhaps the mother most known for being a Gold Star mother was Aletta Sullivan, the mother of the five Sullivan brothers, who were killed in action when their ship, the was sunk by an enemy torpedo on November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. On September 21, 1948, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp, specially designed by artist Charles R. Chickering, honoring the Gold Star Mothers. Aletta Sullivan was given the first sheet of stamps issued.

==Gold Star Mother&#x27;s Day==
On the last Sunday in September, Gold Star Mother&#x27;s Day is observed in the U.S. in honor of Gold Star mothers, as established in Title 36 § 111 of the United States Code. This was originally declared by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936. In September 2012, Barack Obama issued a presidential proclamation commemorating September 30, 2012, as &quot;Gold Star Mother&#x27;s and Family&#x27;s Day&quot;. On September 23, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed &quot;Gold Star Mother&#x27;s and Family&#x27;s Day&quot;.

==American Gold Star Manor==
American Gold Star Manor, located in Long Beach, California, is a 348-unit retirement home for parents of soldiers killed while serving in the military. It was founded in the early 1960s by Eleanor Boyd, then president of the American Gold Star Mothers organization.

<doc id="244356" wikidata="Q2392315" url="?curid=244356" title="List of adjectival and demonymic forms of place names">
<text>The following is a partial list of adjectival forms of place names in English and their demonymic equivalents, which denote the people or the inhabitants of these places.

Note: Demonyms are given in plural forms. Singular forms simply remove the final &#x27;s&#x27; or, in the case of &quot;-ese&quot; endings, are the same as the plural forms.
The ending &quot;-men&quot; has feminine equivalent &quot;-women&quot; (e.g. &quot;an Irishman and a Scotswoman&quot;). The French terminations &quot;-ois&quot; / &quot;ais&quot; serve as both the singular and plural masculine; adding &#x27;e&#x27; ( / ) makes them singular feminine; &#x27;es&#x27; ( / ) makes them plural feminine. The Spanish termination &quot;-o&quot; usually denotes the masculine and is normally changed to feminine by replacing the &quot;-o&quot; with &quot;-a&quot;. The plural forms are usually &quot;-os&quot; and &quot;-as&quot; respectively.

Adjectives ending &quot;-ish&quot; can be used as collective demonyms (e.g. &quot;the English, the Cornish&quot;). So can those ending in &quot;-ch&quot; / &quot;-tch&quot; (e.g. &quot;the French&quot;, &quot;the Dutch&quot;) provided they are pronounced with a &#x27;ch&#x27; sound (e.g., the adjective &quot;Czech&quot; does not qualify).

Where an adjective is a link, the link is to the language or dialect of the same name. (Reference: Ethnologue, Languages of the World)

Many place-name adjectives and many demonyms refer also to various other things, sometimes with and sometimes without one or more additional words. (Sometimes, the use of one or more additional words is optional.) Notable examples are cheeses, cat breeds, dog breeds, and horse breeds. (See List of words derived from toponyms.)

<doc id="244362" wikidata="Q747894" url="?curid=244362" title="Supercell">
<text>A supercell is a thunderstorm characterized by the presence of a mesocyclone, a deep, persistently rotating updraft. Due to this, these storms are sometimes referred to as rotating thunderstorms. Of the four classifications of thunderstorms (supercell, squall line, multi-cell, and single-cell), supercells are the overall least common and have the potential to be the most severe. Supercells are often isolated from other thunderstorms, and can dominate the local weather up to away. They tend to last 2–4 hours.

Supercells are often put into three classification types: classic (normal precipitation level), low-precipitation (LP), and high-precipitation (HP). LP supercells are usually found in climates that are more arid, such as the high plains of the United States, and HP supercells are most often found in moist climates. Supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right pre-existing weather conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the United States in an area known as Tornado Alley. A high number of supercells are seen in many parts of Europe as well as in the Tornado Corridor () of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil and Paraguay.

==Characteristics==
Supercells are usually found isolated from other thunderstorms, although they can sometimes be embedded in a squall line. Typically, supercells are found in the warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction in line with the cold front of the low pressure system. Because they can last for hours, they are known as quasi-steady-state storms. Supercells have the capability to deviate from the mean wind. If they track to the right or left of the mean wind (relative to the vertical wind shear), they are said to be &quot;right-movers&quot; or &quot;left-movers,&quot; respectively. Supercells can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations, which splits the storm into two supercells: one left-mover and one right-mover.

Supercells can be any size – large or small, low or high topped. They usually produce copious amounts of hail, torrential rainfall, strong winds, and substantial downbursts. Supercells are one of the few types of clouds that typically spawn tornadoes within the mesocyclone, although only 30% or fewer do so.

==Geography==
Supercells can occur anywhere in the world under the right weather conditions. The first storm to be identified as the supercell type was the Wokingham storm over England, which was studied by Keith Browning and Frank Ludlam in 1962. Browning did the initial work that was followed up by Lemon and Doswell to develop the modern conceptual model of the supercell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lemon/Doswell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that records are available, supercells are most frequent in the Great Plains of the central United States and southern Canada extending into the southeastern U.S. and northern Mexico; east-central Argentina and adjacent regions of Uruguay; Bangladesh and parts of eastern India; South Africa; and eastern Australia. Supercells occur occasionally in many other mid-latitude regions, including Eastern China and throughout Europe. The areas with highest frequencies of supercells are similar to those with the most occurrences of tornadoes; see tornado climatology and Tornado Alley.

==Supercell anatomy==

The current conceptual model of a supercell was described in &quot;Severe Thunderstorm Evolution and Mesocyclone Structure as Related to Tornadogenesis&quot; by Leslie R. Lemon and Charles A. Doswell III (see Lemon technique). Moisture streams in from the side of the precipitation-free base and merges into a line of warm uplift region where the tower of the thundercloud is tipped by high-altitude shear winds. The high shear causes horizontal vorticity which is tilted within the updraft to become vertical vorticity, and the mass of clouds spins as it gains altitude up to the cap, which can be up to – above ground for the largest storms, and trailing anvil.

Supercells derive their rotation through the tilting of horizontal vorticity, which is caused by wind shear imparting rotation upon a rising air parcel by differential forces. Strong updrafts lift the air turning about a horizontal axis and cause this air to turn about a vertical axis. This forms a deep rotating updraft, the mesocyclone.

A &quot;cap&quot; or capping inversion is usually required to form an updraft of sufficient strength. The moisture-laden air is then cooled enough to precipitate as it is rotated toward the cooler region, represented by the turbulent air of the mammatus clouds where the warm air is spilling over top of the cooler, invading air. The cap is formed where shear winds block further uplift for a time, until a relative weakness allows a breakthrough of the cap (an overshooting top); cooler air to the right in the image may or may not form a shelf cloud, but the precipitation zone will occur where the heat engine of the uplift intermingles with the invading, colder air. The cap puts an inverted (warm-above-cold) layer above a normal (cold-above-warm) boundary layer, and by preventing warm surface air from rising, allows one or both of the following:
* Air below the cap warms and/or becomes more moist
* Air above the cap cools

As the cooler but drier air circulates into the warm, moisture laden inflow, the cloud base will frequently form a wall, and the cloud base often experiences a lowering, which, in extreme cases, are where tornadoes are formed. This creates a warmer, moister layer below a cooler layer, which is increasingly unstable (because warm air is less dense and tends to rise). When the cap weakens or moves, explosive development follows.

In North America, supercells usually show up on Doppler weather radar as starting at a point or hook shape on the southwestern side, fanning out to the northeast. The heaviest precipitation is usually on the southwest side, ending abruptly short of the &quot;rain-free updraft base&quot; or &quot;main updraft&quot; (not visible to radar). The &quot;rear flank downdraft&quot;, or RFD, carries precipitation counterclockwise around the north and northwest side of the updraft base, producing a &quot;hook echo&quot; that indicates the presence of a mesocyclone.

===Structure===
====Overshooting top====

This &quot;dome&quot; feature appears above the strongest updraft location on the anvil of the storm. It is a result of an updraft powerful enough to break through the upper levels of the troposphere into the lower stratosphere. An observer at ground level and close to the storm may be unable to see the overshooting top because the anvil blocks the sight of this feature. The overshooting is visible from satellite images as a &quot;bubbling&quot; amidst the otherwise smooth upper surface of the anvil cloud.

====Anvil====
An anvil forms when the storm&#x27;s updraft collides with the upper levels of the lowest layer of the atmosphere, or the tropopause, and has nowhere else to go due to the laws of fluid dynamics- specifically pressure, humidity, and density, in simple terms, the packet of air has lost its buoyancy and cannot rise higher. The anvil is very cold (-30°C) and virtually precipitation-free even though virga can be seen falling from the forward sheared anvil. Since there is so little moisture in the anvil, winds can move freely. The clouds take on their anvil shape when the rising air reaches or more. The anvil&#x27;s distinguishing feature is that it juts out in front of the storm like a shelf. In some cases, it can even shear backwards, called a backsheared anvil, another sign of a very strong updraft.

==== Precipitation-free base ====
This area, typically on the southern side of the storm in North America, is relatively precipitation-free. This is located beneath the main updraft, and is the main area of inflow. While no precipitation may be visible to an observer, large hail may be falling from this area. A region of this area is called the Vault. It is more accurately called the main updraft area.

==== Wall cloud ====
The wall cloud forms near the downdraft/updraft interface. This &quot;interface&quot; is the area between the &quot;precipitation area&quot; and the &quot;precipitation-free base.&quot; Wall clouds form when rain-cooled air from the downdraft is pulled into the updraft. This wet, cold air quickly saturates as it is lifted by the updraft, forming a cloud that seems to &quot;descend&quot; from the precipitation-free base. Wall clouds are common and are not exclusive to supercells; only a small percentage actually produce a tornado, but if a storm does produce a tornado, it usually exhibits wall clouds that persist for more than ten minutes. Wall clouds that seem to move violently up or down, and violent movements of cloud fragments (scud or fractus) near the wall cloud, are indications that a tornado could form.

==== Mammatus clouds ====
Mammatus (Mamma, Mammatocumulus) are bulbous or pillow-like cloud formations extending from beneath the anvil of a thunderstorm. These clouds form as cold air in the anvil region of a storm sinks into warmer air beneath it. Mammatus are most apparent when they are lit from one side or below and are therefore at their most impressive near sunset or shortly after sunrise when the sun is low in the sky. Mammatus are not exclusive to supercells and can be associated with developed thunderstorms and cumulonimbus.

==== Forward flank downdraft (FFD) ====
This is generally the area of heaviest and most widespread precipitation. For most supercells, the precipitation core is bounded on its leading edge by a shelf cloud that results from rain-cooled air within the precipitation core spreading outward and interacting with warmer, moist air from outside of the cell. Between the precipitation-free base and the FFD, a &quot;vaulted&quot; or &quot;cathedral&quot; feature can be observed. In &quot;high precipitation supercells&quot; an area of heavy precipitation may occur beneath the main updraft area where the vault would alternately be observed with classic supercells.

==== Rear flank downdraft (RFD) ====
The rear flank downdraft of a supercell is a very complex and not yet fully understood feature. RFDs mainly occur within classic and HP supercells although RFDs have been observed within LP supercells. The RFD of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by tightening existing rotation within the surface mesocyclone. RFDs are caused by mid-level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the updraft tower and moving around it in all directions; specifically, the flow that is redirected downward is referred to as the RFD. This downward surge of relatively cool mid-level air, due to interactions between dew points, humidity, and condensation of the converging of air masses, can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage. The radar signature of an RFD is a hook-like structure where sinking air has brought with it precipitation.

==== Flanking line ====

A flanking line is a line of smaller cumulonimbi or cumulus that form in the warm rising air pulled in by the main updraft. Due to convergence and lifting along this line, landspouts sometimes occur on the outflow boundary of this region.

=== Radar features of a supercell ===
;Hook echo (or pendant): The &quot;hook echo&quot; is the area of confluence between the main updraft and the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This indicates the position of the mesocyclone and probably a tornado.
;Bounded weak echo region (or BWER): This is a region of low radar reflectivity bounded above by an area of higher radar reflectivity with an untilted updraft, also called a &quot;vault&quot;. It is not observed with all supercells but it is at the edge of a very high precipitation echos with a very sharp gradient perpendicular to the RFD. This is evidence of a strong updraft and often the presence of a tornado. To an observer on the ground, it could be experienced as a zone free of precipitation but usually containing large hail.
;Inflow notch: A &quot;notch&quot; of weak reflectivity on the inflow side of the cell. This is not a &quot;V-Notch.&quot;
;V Notch: A V-shaped notch on the leading edge of the cell, opening away from the main downdraft. This is an indication of divergent flow around a powerful updraft.
;Hail spike: This three body scatter spike is a region of weak echoes found radially behind the main reflectivity core at higher elevations when large hail is present.

==== Descending reflectivity core ====
== Supercell variations ==
Supercell thunderstorms are sometimes classified by meteorologists and storm spotters into three categories; however, not all supercells, being hybrid storms, fit neatly into any one category, and many supercells may fall into different categories during different periods of their lifetimes. The standard definition given above is referred to as the Classic supercell. All types of supercells typically produce severe weather.

=== Low precipitation (LP) ===

LP supercells contain a small and relatively light precipitation (rain/hail) core that is well separated from the updraft. The updraft is intense, and LPs are inflow dominant storms. The updraft tower is typically more strongly tilted and the deviant rightward motion less than for other supercell types. The forward flank downdraft (FFD) is noticeably weaker than for other supercell types, and the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) is much weaker—even visually absent in many cases. Like classic supercells, LP supercells tend to form within stronger mid-to-upper level storm-relative wind shear; however, the atmospheric environment leading to their formation is not well understood. The moisture profile of the atmosphere, particularly the depth of the elevated dry layer, also appears to be important, and the low-to-mid level shear may also be important.

This type of supercell may be easily identifiable with &quot;sculpted&quot; cloud striations in the updraft base or even a &quot;corkscrewed&quot; or &quot;barber pole&quot; appearance on the updraft, and sometimes an almost &quot;anorexic&quot; look compared to classic supercells. This is because they often form within drier moisture profiles (often initiated by dry lines) leaving LPs with little available moisture despite high mid-to-upper level environmental winds. They most often dissipate rather than turning into classic or HP supercells, although it is still not unusual for LPs to do the latter, especially when moving into a much moister air mass. LPs were first formally described by Howard Bluestein in the early 1980s although storm-chasing scientists noticed them throughout the 1970s. Classic supercells may wither yet maintain updraft rotation as they decay, becoming more like the LP type in a process known as &quot;downscale transition&quot; that also applies to LP storms, and this process is thought to be how many LPs dissipate.

LP supercells rarely spawn tornadoes, and those that form tend to be weak, small, and high-based tornadoes, but strong tornadoes have been observed. These storms, although generating lesser precipitation amounts and producing smaller precipitation cores, can generate huge hail. LPs may produce hail larger than baseballs in clear air where no rainfall is visible. LPs are thus hazardous to people and animals caught outside as well as to storm chasers and spotters. Due to the lack of a heavy precipitation core, LP supercells often exhibit relatively weak radar reflectivity without clear evidence of a hook echo, when in fact they are producing a tornado at the time. LP supercells may not even be recognized as supercells in reflectivity data unless one is trained or experienced on their radar characteristics. This is where observations by storm spotter and storm chasers may be of vital importance in addition to Doppler velocity (and polarimetric) radar data. 

LP supercells are quite sought after by storm chasers because the limited amount of precipitation makes sighting tornadoes at a safe distance much less difficult than with a classic or HP supercell and more so because of the unobscured storm structure unveiled. During spring and early summer, areas in which LP supercells are readily spotted include southwestern Oklahoma and northwestern Texas, among other parts of the western Great Plains.

=== High precipitation (HP) ===

The HP supercell has a much heavier precipitation core that can wrap all the way around the mesocyclone. These are especially dangerous storms, since the mesocyclone is wrapped with rain and can hide a tornado (if present) from view. These storms also cause flooding due to heavy rain, damaging downbursts, and weak tornadoes, although they are also known to produce strong to violent tornadoes. They have a lower potential for damaging hail than Classic and LP supercells, although damaging hail is possible. It has been observed by some spotters that they tend to produce more cloud-to-ground and intracloud lightning than the other types. Also, unlike the LP and Classic types, severe events usually occur at the front (southeast) of the storm. The HP supercell is the most common type of supercell in the United States east of Interstate 35, in the southern parts of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, in France, Germany and the Po Valley in north Italy and in the central portions of Argentina and Uruguay.
=== Mini-supercell or low-topped supercell ===
Whereas classic, HP, and LP refer to different precipitation regimes and mesoscale frontal structures, another variation was identified in the early 1990s by Jon Davies. These smaller storms were initially called mini-supercells but are now commonly referred to as low-topped supercells. These are also subdivided into Classic, HP and LP types.

== Effects ==

Supercells can produce hailstones averaging as large as in diameter, winds over , tornadoes of as strong as EF3 to EF5 intensity (if wind shear and atmospheric instability are able to support the development of stronger tornadoes), flooding, frequent-to-continuous lightning, and very heavy rain. Many tornado outbreaks come from clusters of supercells. Large supercells may spawn multiple long-tracked and deadly tornadoes, with notable examples in the 2011 Super Outbreak.

Severe events associated with a supercell almost always occur in the area of the updraft/downdraft interface. In the Northern Hemisphere, this is most often the rear flank (southwest side) of the precipitation area in LP and classic supercells, but sometimes the leading edge (southeast side) of HP supercells.
==Examples worldwide==
=== Asia ===
Some reports suggest that the deluge on 26 July 2005 in Mumbai, India was caused by a supercell when there was a cloud formation high over the city. On this day of rain fell over the city, of which fell in just four hours. The rainfall coincided with a high tide, which exacerbated conditions.

Supercells occur commonly from March to May in Bangladesh, West Bengal, and the bordering northeastern Indian states including Tripura. Supercells that produce very high winds with hail and occasional tornadoes are observed in these regions. They also occur along the Northern Plains of India and Pakistan. On March 23, 2013, a massive tornado ripped through Brahmanbaria district in Bangladesh, killing 20 and injuring 200.

=== Australia ===

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1947 a supercell hit Sydney. The classic type Supercell formed over the Blue Mountains, mid-morning hitting the lower CBD and eastern suburbs by mid-afternoon with the hail similar in size to a cricket ball. At the time, it was the most severe storm to strike the city since recorded observations began in 1792.

On April 14, 1999, a severe storm later classified as a supercell hit the east coast of New South Wales. It is estimated that the storm dropped worth of hailstones during its course. At the time it was the most costly disaster in Australia&#x27;s insurance history, causing an approximated A$2.3 billion worth of damage, of which A$1.7 billion was covered by insurance.

On February 27, 2007, a supercell hit Canberra, dumping nearly of ice in Civic. The ice was so heavy that a newly built shopping center&#x27;s roof collapsed, birds were killed in the hail produced from the supercell, and people were stranded. The following day many homes in Canberra were subjected to flash flooding, caused either by the city&#x27;s infrastructure&#x27;s inability to cope with storm water or through mud slides from cleared land.

On 6 March 2010, supercell storms hit Melbourne. The storms caused flash flooding in the center of the city and tennis ball-sized () hailstones hit cars and buildings, causing more than $220 million worth of damage and sparking 40,000-plus insurance claims. In just 18 minutes, of rain fell, causing havoc as streets were flooded and trains, planes, and cars were brought to a standstill.

That same month, on March 22, 2010 a supercell hit Perth. This storm was one of the worst in the city&#x27;s history, causing hail stones of in size and torrential rain. The city had its average March rainfall in just seven minutes during the storm. Hail stones caused severe property damage, from dented cars to smashed windows. The storm itself caused more than 100 million dollars in damage.

On November 27, 2014 a supercell hit the inner city suburbs including the CBD of Brisbane. Hailstones up to softball size cut power to 71,000 properties, injuring 39 people, and causing a damage bill of $1 billion AUD. A wind gust of 141 km/h was recorded at Archerfield Airport

=== South America ===

An area in South America known as the Tornado Corridor is considered to be the second most frequent location for severe weather, after Tornado Alley in the United States. The region, which covers portions of Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Brazil during the spring and summer, often experiences strong thunderstorms which may include tornadoes. One of the first known South American supercell thunderstorms to include tornadoes occurred on September 16, 1816, and destroyed the town of Rojas ( west of the city of Buenos Aires).

On September 20, 1926, an F4 tornado struck the city of Encarnación (Paraguay), killing over 300 people and making it the second deadliest tornado in South America. On 21 April 1970, the town of Fray Marcos in the Department of Florida, Uruguay experienced an F4 tornado that killed 11, the strongest in the history of the nation. January 10, 1973, saw the most severe tornado in the history of South America: The San Justo tornado, 105 km north of the city of Santa Fe (Argentina), was rated F5, making it the strongest tornado ever recorded in the southern hemisphere, with winds exceeding 400 km/h. On April 13, 1993, in less than 24 hours in the province of Buenos Aires was given the largest tornado outbreak in the history of South America. There were more than 300 tornadoes recorded, with intensities between F1 and F3. The most affected towns were Henderson (EF3), Urdampilleta (EF3) and Mar del Plata (EF2). In December 2000, a series of twelve tornadoes (only registered) affected the Greater Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires, causing serious damage. One of them struck the town of Guernica, and, just two weeks later, in January 2001, an F3 again devastated Guernica, killing 2 people.

The December 26, 2003, Tornado F3 happened in Cordoba, with winds exceeding 300 km/h, which hit Córdoba Capital, just 6 km from the city center, in the area known as CPC Route 20, especially neighborhoods of San Roque and Villa Fabric, killing 5 people and injuring hundreds. The tornado that hit the State of São Paulo in 2004 was one of the most destructive in the state, destroying several industrial buildings, 400 houses, killing one and wounding 11. The tornado was rated EF3, but many claim it was a tornado EF4. In November 2009, four tornadoes, rated F1 and F2 reached the town of Posadas (capital of the province of Misiones, Argentina), generating serious damage in the city. Three of the tornadoes affected the airport area, causing damage in Barrio Belén. On April 4, 2012, the Gran Buenos Aires was hit by the storm Buenos Aires, with intensities F1 and F2, which left nearly 30 dead in various locations.

On February 21, 2014, in Berazategui (province of Buenos Aires), a tornado of intensity F1 caused material damage including a car was, with two occupants inside, which was elevated a few feet off the ground and flipped over asphalt, both the driver and his passenger were slightly injured. The tornado caused no fatalities. The severe weather that occurred on Tuesday 8/11 had features rarely seen in such magnitude in Argentina. In many towns of La Pampa, San Luis, Buenos Aires and Cordoba, intense hail stones fell up to 6 cm in diameter. On Sunday December 8, 2013, severe storms took place in the center and the coast. The most affected province was Córdoba, storms and supercells type &quot;bow echos&quot; also developed in Santa Fe and San Luis.

=== Europe ===
During the evening of August 3, 2008, a supercell formed over northern France. It spawned an F4 tornado in the Val de Sambre area, about 90 kilometers east of Lille, which impacted nearby cities such as Maubeuge and Hautmont. This same supercell later went on to generate other tornadoes in the Netherlands and Germany.

In 2009, on the night of Monday May 25, a supercell formed over Belgium. It was described by Belgian meteorologist Frank Deboosere as &quot;one of the worst storms in recent years&quot; and caused much damage in Belgium – mainly in the provinces of East Flanders (around Ghent), Flemish Brabant (around Brussels) and Antwerp. The storm occurred between about 1:00 am and 4:00 am local time. An incredible 30,000 lightning flashes were recorded in 2 hours – including 10,000 cloud-to-ground strikes. Hailstones up to across were observed in some places and wind gusts over ; in Melle near Ghent a gust of was reported. Trees were uprooted and blown onto several motorways. In Lillo (east of Antwerp) a loaded goods train was blown from the rail tracks.

On May 24, 2010, an intense supercell left behind a trail of destruction spanning across three different states in eastern Germany. It produced multiple strong downbursts, damaging hail and at least four tornadoes, most notably an F3 wedge tornado which struck the town of Großenhain, killing one person.

On June 28, 2012, three supercells affected England. Two of them formed over the Midlands, producing hailstones reported to be larger than golf balls, with conglomerate stones up to 10 cm across. Burbage in Leicestershire saw some of the most severe hail. Another supercell produced a tornado near Sleaford, in Lincolnshire.

On July 28, 2013, an exceptionally long-lived supercell tracked along an almost 400 km long path across parts of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany, before falling apart in Czechia. The storm had a lifespan of around 7 hours and produced large hail of up to 8 cm in diameter. The city of Reutlingen was hit the hardest, houses and cars were severely damaged, dozens of people injured. With roughly 3.6 billion euros worth of damage, it was by far the costliest thunderstorm event ever documented in Germany.

On 25 July 2019 a supercell thunderstorm affected northern England and parts of Northumberland. Large hail, frequent lightning and rotation were reported by many people. On 24 September 2020 a similar event affected parts of West Yorkshire.

Only 5 days after that on June 24, 2021, a supercell produced an F4 tornado in south Moravia, Czech Republic. This tornado caused 6 deaths and left more than 200 people injured. With roughly $700 million of damage it was one of the costliest tornadoes to occur outside of the United States.

=== North America ===
Tornado Alley is a region of the central United States where severe weather is common, particularly tornadoes. Supercell thunderstorms occur more frequently in tornado alley and Dixie Alley than anywhere else in the world. Tornado watches and warnings are frequently necessary in the spring and summer. Most places from the Great Plains to the East Coast of the United States and north as far as the Canadian Prairies, the Great Lakes region, and the St. Lawrence River will experience one or more supercells each year.

The 1980 Grand Island tornado outbreak affected the city of Grand Island, Nebraska on June 3, 1980. Seven tornadoes touched down in or near the city that night, killing 5 and injuring 200.

The Elie, Manitoba tornado was an F5 that struck the town of Elie, Manitoba on June 22, 2007. While several houses were leveled, no one was injured or killed by the tornado.

The most intense tornado outbreaks on record, known as super outbreaks, have all occurred in the United States. The 1974 Super Outbreak and 2011 Super Outbreak each spawned over 10 violent tornadoes, killed over 300, and caused billions in damage, most of which can be attributed to tornado damage.

A massive tornado outbreak on May 3, 1999 spawned an F5 tornado in the area of Oklahoma City that had the highest recorded winds on Earth. Another series of tornadoes, which occurred in May 2013, caused severe devastation to Oklahoma City in general. From May 18 to May 21, a series of tornadoes hit, including a tornado which was later rated EF5, which traveled across parts of the Oklahoma City area, causing a severe amount of damage in a heavily populated section of Moore. Twenty-three fatalities and 377 injuries were caused by the tornado. Sixty-one other tornadoes were confirmed during the storm period. Later on in the same month, on the night of May 31, 2013, another eight deaths were confirmed from what became the widest tornado on record which hit El Reno, Oklahoma, one of a series of tornadoes and funnel clouds which hit nearby areas.

In Mexico, the tallest non-tropical thunderstorm on record occurred as a high-topped supercell near Nueva Rosita, Coahuila on May 24, 2016. This storm was recorded at a height of and produced lightning as far away as from the center.

=== South Africa ===
South Africa witnesses several supercell thunderstorms each year with the inclusion of isolated tornadoes. On most occasions these tornadoes occur in open farmlands and rarely cause damage to property, as such many of the tornadoes which do occur in South Africa are not reported. The majority of supercells develop in the central, northern, and north eastern parts of the country. The Free State, Gauteng, and Kwazulu Natal are typically the provinces where these storms are most commonly experienced, though supercell activity is not limited to these provinces. On occasion, hail reaches sizes in excess of golf balls, and tornadoes, though rare, also occur.

On 6 May 2009, a well-defined hook echo was noticed on local South African radars, along with satellite imagery this supported the presence of a strong supercell storm. Reports from the area indicated heavy rains, winds and large hail.

On October 2, 2011, two devastating tornadoes tore through two separate parts of South Africa on the same day, hours apart from each other. The first, classified as an EF2 hit Meqheleng, the informal settlement outside Ficksburg, Free State which devastated shacks and homes, uprooted trees, and killed one small child. The second, which hit the informal settlement of Duduza, Nigel in the Gauteng province, also classified as EF2 hit hours apart from the one that struck Ficksburg. This tornado completely devastated parts of the informal settlement and killed two children, destroying shacks and RDP homes.

<text>A mesocyclone is a meso-gamma mesoscale (or storm scale) region of rotation (vortex), typically around in diameter, most often noticed on radar within thunderstorms. In the Northern Hemisphere, it is usually located in the right rear flank (back edge with respect to direction of movement) of a supercell, or often on the eastern, or leading, flank of a high-precipitation variety of supercell. The area overlaid by a mesocyclone’s circulation may be several miles (km) wide, but substantially larger than any tornado that may develop within it, and it is within mesocyclones that intense tornadoes form.

== Description ==
Mesocyclones are medium-scale vortices of rising and converging air that circulate around a vertical axis. They are most often associated with a local region of low-pressure. Their rotation is (usually) in the same direction as low pressure systems in a given hemisphere: counter-clockwise in the northern, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere, with the only occasional exceptions being the smallest-scale mesocyclones. Mesoanticyclones that rotate in an opposite direction may accompany mesocyclones within a supercell but these tend to be weaker and often more transient than mesocyclones, which can be sustained for tens of minutes or hours, and also cyclically form in succession within a supercell. Mesoanticyclones are relatively common with left-moving supercells that split from parent supercells in certain vertical wind shear regimes.

A mesocyclone is usually a phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly. Visual evidence of rotation – such as curved inflow bands – may suggest the presence of a mesocyclone, but the cylinder of circulating air is often too large to be recognized when viewed from the ground, or may not carry clouds distinct enough from the surrounding calmer air to make the circulating air flow obvious.

Mesocyclones are identified by Doppler weather radar observations as a rotation signature which meets specific criteria for magnitude, vertical depth, and duration. On U.S. NEXRAD radar displays, algorithmically identified mesocyclones, such as by the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA), are typically highlighted by a yellow solid circle on the Doppler velocity display; other weather services may have other conventions.

== Within thunderstorms ==
They are of greatest concern when contained within severe thunderstorms, since mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, within which tornadoes may form near the interchange with a downdraft.

Mesocyclones are localized, approximately to in diameter within strong thunderstorms. Thunderstorms containing persistent mesocyclones are &quot;supercell thunderstorms&quot; (although some supercells and even tornadic storms do not produce lightning or thunder and thus are not technically thunderstorms). Doppler weather radar is used to identify mesocyclones. A mesovortex is a similar but typically smaller and weaker rotational feature associated with squall lines.

== Formation ==
Mesocyclones form when strong changes of wind speed and/or direction with height (&quot;wind shear&quot;) sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube-like rolls. The convective updraft of a storm then draws up this spinning air, tilting the rolls&#x27; orientation upward (from parallel to the ground to perpendicular) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column.

As the updraft rotates and ingests cooler, moister air from the forward flank downdraft (FFD), it may form a wall cloud, a spinning layer of clouds lowered from ambient storm cloud base under the mid-level mesocyclone. The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone. As it descends, a funnel cloud may form near its center. This is usually the first visible stage of development of a tornado.

The gallery below shows the three stages of development of a mesocyclone and a view of the storm relative motion on radar of a mesocyclone-producing tornado over Greensburg, Kansas on 4 May 2007. The storm was in the process of producing an EF5 tornado at the time of the image.
== Identification ==
The most reliable way to detect a mesocyclone is by Doppler weather radar. Nearby high values of opposite sign within velocity data are how they are detected. Mesocyclones are most often located in the right-rear flank of supercell thunderstorms and when embedded within squall lines (whereas mesovortices most often form in the front flank of squall lines), and may be distinguished by a hook echo rotation signature on a weather radar map. Visual cues such as a rotating wall cloud or tornado may also hint at the presence of a mesocyclone. This is why the term has entered into wider usage in connection with rotating features in severe storms.
== Tornado formation ==

Tornado formation is not completely understood, but often occurs in one of two ways.

In the first method, two conditions must be satisfied. First, a horizontal spinning effect must form on the Earth&#x27;s surface. This usually originates in sudden changes in wind direction or speed, known as wind shear. Second, a cumulonimbus cloud, or occasionally a cumulus cloud, must be present.

During a thunderstorm, updrafts are occasionally powerful enough to lift the horizontal spinning row of air upwards, turning it into a vertical air column. This vertical air column then becomes the basic structure for the tornado. Tornadoes that form in this way are often weak and generally last less than 10 minutes.

The second method occurs during a supercell thunderstorm, in updrafts within the storm. When winds intensify, the force released can cause the updrafts to rotate. This rotating updraft is known as a mesocyclone.

For a tornado to form in this manner, a rear-flank downdraft enters the center of the mesocyclone from the back. Cold air, being denser than warm air, is able to penetrate the updraft. The combination of the updraft and downdraft completes the development of a tornado. Tornadoes that form in this method are often violent and can last over an hour.

==Mesoscale convective vortex==

A mesoscale convective vortex (MCV), also known as a mesoscale vorticity center or Neddy eddy, is a mesocyclone within a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that pulls winds into a circling pattern, or vortex, at the mid levels of the troposphere and is normally associated with anticyclonic outflow aloft, with a region of aeronautically troublesome wind shear between the upper and lower air. With a core only wide and deep, an MCV is often overlooked in standard weather maps. MCVs can persist for up to two days after its parent mesoscale convective system has dissipated.

The orphaned MCV can become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak. An MCV that moves into tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, can serve as the nucleus for a tropical cyclone. An example of this was Hurricane Barry in 2019. MCVs can produce very large wind storms; sometimes winds can reach over . The May 2009 Southern Midwest Derecho was an extreme progressive derecho and mesoscale convective vortex event that struck southeastern Kansas, southern Missouri, and southwestern Illinois on 8 May 2009.

<text>Commandaria (also called Commanderia and Coumadarka; , and Cypriot Greek κουμανταρκά) is an amber-coloured sweet dessert wine made in the Commandaria region of Cyprus on the foothills of the Troödos Mountains. Commandaria is made from sun-dried grapes of the varieties Xynisteri and Mavro. While often a fortified wine, through its production method it often reaches high alcohol levels, around 15%, already before fortification. It represents an ancient wine style documented in Cyprus back to 800 BC and has the distinction of being the world&#x27;s oldest named wine still in production, with the name Commandaria dating back to the crusades in the 12th century.

== History ==
The wine has a long history, said to date back to the time of the ancient Greeks, when it was a popular drink at festivals. A dried grape wine from Cyprus was first known to be described in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod and was known by, much later, as the &quot;Cypriot Manna&quot;.
During the crusades, Commandaria was served at the 12th-century wedding of King Richard the Lionheart to Berengaria of Navarre, in the town of Limassol; it was during the wedding that King Richard pronounced Commandaria &quot;the wine of kings and the king of wines&quot;. Near the end of the century he sold the island to the Knights Templar, who then sold it to Guy de Lusignan, but kept a large feudal estate at Kolossi, close to Limassol, to themselves. This estate was referred to as &quot;La Grande Commanderie&quot;. The word &quot;Commanderie&quot; referred to the military headquarters whilst &quot;Grande&quot; helped distinguish it from two smaller such command posts on the island, one close to Paphos (Phoenix) and another near Kyrenia (Templos).
This area under the control of the Knights Templar (and subsequently the Knights Hospitaller) became known as &quot;Commandaria&quot;. When the knights began producing large quantities of the wine for export to Europe&#x27;s royal courts and for supplying pilgrims en route to the holy lands, the wine assumed the name of the region. Thus it has the distinction of being the world&#x27;s oldest named wine still in production.

Although today it is produced and marketed under the name &quot;Commandaria&quot;, it has been referred to with several similar names and spellings in the past. In 1863, Thomas George Shaw in his book &quot;Wine, the vine, and the cellar&quot; refers to this wine as &quot;Commanderi&quot; whilst in 1879, Samuel Baker refers to it as &quot;Commanderia&quot;. In 1833 Cyrus Redding in his book &quot;&quot;A history and description of modern wines&quot; makes reference to the wine of the &quot;Commandery&quot;&quot;.

Legend has it that in the 13th century Philip Augustus of France held the first ever wine tasting competition. The event, branded The Battle of the Wines &quot;(fr. La Bataille des Vins)&quot;, was recorded in a notable French poem written by Henry d&#x27;Andeli in 1224. The competition which included wines from all over Europe and France, was won by a sweet wine from Cyprus widely believed to be Commandaria. The &quot;Commandery&quot; region itself fell into the control of his descendant Philip IV in 1307, after the suppression of the Knights Templar.

Another legend has it that the Ottoman sultan Selim II invaded the island just to acquire Commandaria; also that the grapes used to make this wine were the same grapes exported to Portugal that eventually became famous as the source of port wine.

== Production ==
Commandaria is made exclusively from two types of indigenous Cyprus grapes: Xynisteri and Mavro. The grapes are left to overripe on the vine and when sugar content reaches acceptable levels (corresponding to high must weight) they are harvested. More specifically, Xynisteri is picked when at around 12 degrees Baumé (°Bé) and Mavro at 15-16 °Bé. The grapes are then laid out in the sun to further increase the sugar density through evaporation. When the must weight reaches 19 to 23 °Bé the juice is extracted through crushing and pressing. Fermentation takes place in reservoirs and will arrest naturally due to the high levels of alcohol achieved at around 15%. The above process has to take place within the confines of 14 designated villages that lie in the Commandaria Region &quot;(see below)&quot;. Commandaria, by law, is aged for at least two years in Oak Barrels but this can take place outside the above-designated area within Cyprus under strict control and under the conditions laid down in Cypriot legislation.&lt;ref name=&#x27;Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 Annex VI Part D (1)(b)&#x27;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Once fermentation has been completed, at a minimum alcohol level of 10% (which is often exceeded), the alcoholic strength of Commandaria may be increased by the addition of pure 95% grape alcohol or a wine distillate of at least 70% alcohol to a minimum of 15% of alcohol. However, after this addition, the wine&#x27;s actual alcohol content may not exceed 20%, while its total potential alcohol (including its sugar content) must be at least 22.5%. Thus, Commandaria may be a fortified wine, but fortification is not mandatory.

The origins of the production method are not definite. In his poem &quot;Works and Days&quot;, written in the 7th century BC, Hesiod, writes: 

Pliny the Elder describes similar methods employed by the Greeks for making sweet wines, 

In his account, Samuel Baker describes the production in 1879 He claims that the evolution of this method was more out of necessity than choice..… 

Commandaria was produced by the large wine industries (KEO, ETKO, LOEL, and SODAP) and by a few small local producers of the Commandaria appellation zone &quot;(see below)&quot;. Nowadays several other modern wineries are producing high-quality Commandaria (Oenou Yi, Tsiakas, Kyperounda, etc.).

Data recorded by Samuel Baker in his book &quot;Cyprus - How I saw it in 1879&quot; reveal that in the late 19th century Cyprus had an annual production of about 300,000 okes, equivalent to about 385,000 litres (data reflects only duty-paid production). Of this, Cyprus exported 180,103 okes from Limassol Port, of which the vast majority went to Austria (155,000 okes valued at UK£2,075).

Official figures released by Cyprus’ Vines Products Commission show that there is a generally increasing trend in the volumes produced. Much of Commandaria production is still targeted for export.
== Authentication ==

Currently Commandaria holds a protected designation of origin (PDO) within the European Union, the United States and Canada. By Cypriot legislation passed on 2 March 1990, it is only produced in a collection of 14 neighbouring villages: Agios Georgios, Agios Konstantinos, Agios Mamas, Agios Pavlos, Apsiou, Gerasa, Doros, Zoopigi, Kalo Chorio, Kapilio, Laneia, Louvaras, Monagri and Silikou. The designated area has assumed the name of the Commandaria Region and is located on the south-facing slopes of the Troödos Mountains at an altitude of 500-900m within the Limassol District. Only grapes from vineyards that have been planted for at least 4 years are allowed. Vine training must follow the goblet method and watering is prohibited. The grape harvest may only commence after the vine products commission of Cyprus has given the green light, based on the average sugar content of the grapes. Xinisteri grapes must demonstrate a sugar content of 212 g/L whilst Mavro can only qualify with a reading of 258 g/L and above. The sugar concentration is then raised by laying the grapes in the sun, usually for 7–10 days, to a strict window of 390 to 450g/L.

In February 2006, the Wine Products Association of Cyprus selected an official Commandaria wine glass, manufactured by Riedel, an Austrian wine glass company.

<doc id="244373" wikidata="Q126736" url="?curid=244373" title="Scalar multiplication">
<text>In mathematics, scalar multiplication is one of the basic operations defining a vector space in linear algebra (or more generally, a module in abstract algebra). In common geometrical contexts, scalar multiplication of a real Euclidean vector by a positive real number multiplies the magnitude of the vector without changing its direction. Scalar multiplication is the multiplication of a vector by a scalar (where the product is a vector), and is to be distinguished from inner product of two vectors (where the product is a scalar).

==Definition==
In general, if &quot;K&quot; is a field and &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over &quot;K&quot;, then scalar multiplication is a function from &quot;K&quot; × &quot;V&quot; to &quot;V&quot;.
The result of applying this function to &quot;k&quot; in &quot;K&quot; and v in &quot;V&quot; is denoted &quot;k&quot;v.

===Properties===

Scalar multiplication obeys the following rules &quot;(vector in boldface)&quot;:
* Additivity in the scalar: (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)v = &quot;cv + &quot;dv;
* Additivity in the vector: &quot;c&quot;(v + w) = &quot;cv + &quot;cw;
* Compatibility of product of scalars with scalar multiplication: (&quot;cd&quot;)v = &quot;c&quot;(&quot;d&quot;v);
* Multiplying by 1 does not change a vector: 1v = v;
* Multiplying by 0 gives the zero vector: 0v = 0;
* Multiplying by −1 gives the additive inverse: (−1)v = −v.
Here, + is addition either in the field or in the vector space, as appropriate; and 0 is the additive identity in either.
Juxtaposition indicates either scalar multiplication or the multiplication operation in the field.

==Interpretation==

The space of vectors may be considered a coordinate space where elements are associated with a list of elements from &quot;K&quot;. The units of the field form a group &quot;K&quot; × and the scalar-vector multiplication is a group action on the coordinate space by &quot;K&quot; ×. The zero of the field acts on the coordinate space to collapse it to the zero vector.

When &quot;K&quot; is the field of real numbers there is a geometric interpretation of scalar multiplication: it stretches or contracts vectors by a constant factor. As a result, it produces a vector in the same or opposite direction of the original vector but of a different length.

As a special case, &quot;V&quot; may be taken to be &quot;K&quot; itself and scalar multiplication may then be taken to be simply the multiplication in the field.

When &quot;V&quot; is &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot;, scalar multiplication is equivalent to multiplication of each component with the scalar, and may be defined as such.

The same idea applies if &quot;K&quot; is a commutative ring and &quot;V&quot; is a module over &quot;K&quot;.
&quot;K&quot; can even be a rig, but then there is no additive inverse.
If &quot;K&quot; is not commutative, the distinct operations &quot;left scalar multiplication&quot; &quot;cv and &quot;right scalar multiplication&quot; vc&quot; may be defined.

== Scalar multiplication of matrices ==

The left scalar multiplication of a matrix with a scalar gives another matrix of the same size as . It is denoted by , whose entries of are defined by

:formula_1

explicitly:

:formula_2

Similarly, even though there is no widely-accepted definition, the right scalar multiplication of a matrix with a scalar could be defined to be

:formula_3

explicitly:

:formula_4

When the entries of the matrix and the scalars are from the same commutative field, for example, the real number field or the complex number field, these two multiplications are the same, and can be simply called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot;. For matrices over a more general field that is &quot;not&quot; commutative, they may not be equal.

For a real scalar and matrix:

:formula_5

:formula_6

For quaternion scalars and matrices:

:formula_7

:formula_8

where are the quaternion units. The non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication prevents the transition of changing to .

<text>x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64, and Intel 64) is a 64-bit extension of the x86 instruction set architecture first announced in 1999. It introduces two new operating modes: 64-bit mode and compatibility mode, along with a new four-level paging mechanism.

In 64-bit mode, x86-64 supports significantly large amounts of virtual memory and physical memory compared to its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to utilize more memory for data storage. The architecture expands the number of general-purpose registers from 8 to 16, all fully general-purpose, and extends their width to 64 bits.

Floating-point arithmetic is supported through mandatory SSE2 instructions in 64-bit mode. While the older x87 FPU and MMX registers are still available, they are generally superseded by a set of sixteen 128-bit vector registers (XMM registers). Each of these vector registers can store one or two double-precision floating-point numbers, up to four single-precision floating-point numbers, or various integer formats.

In 64-bit mode, instructions are modified to support 64-bit operands and 64-bit addressing mode.

The x86-64 architecture defines a compatibility mode that allows 16-bit and 32-bit user applications to run unmodified alongside 64-bit applications, provided the 64-bit operating system supports them. Since the full x86-32 instruction sets remain implemented in hardware without the need for emulation, these older executables can run with little or no performance penalty, while newer or modified applications can take advantage of new features of the processor design to achieve performance improvements. Also, processors supporting x86-64 still power on in real mode to maintain backward compatibility with the original 8086 processor, as has been the case with x86 processors since the introduction of protected mode with the 80286.

The original specification, created by AMD and released in 2000, has been implemented by AMD, Intel, and VIA. The AMD K8 microarchitecture, in the Opteron and Athlon 64 processors, was the first to implement it. This was the first significant addition to the x86 architecture designed by a company other than Intel. Intel was forced to follow suit and introduced a modified NetBurst family which was software-compatible with AMD&#x27;s specification. VIA Technologies introduced x86-64 in their VIA Isaiah architecture, with the VIA Nano.

The x86-64 architecture was quickly adopted for desktop and laptop personal computers and servers which were commonly configured for 16 GiB (gibibytes) of memory or more. It has effectively replaced the discontinued Intel Itanium architecture (formerly IA-64), which was originally intended to replace the x86 architecture. x86-64 and Itanium are not compatible on the native instruction set level, and operating systems and applications compiled for one architecture cannot be run on the other natively.

== AMD64 ==
=== History ===
AMD64 (also variously referred to by AMD in their literature and documentation as “AMD 64-bit Technology” and “AMD x86-64 Architecture”) was created as an alternative to the radically different IA-64 architecture designed by Intel and Hewlett-Packard, which was backward-incompatible with IA-32, the 32-bit version of the x86 architecture. AMD originally announced AMD64 in 1999 with a full specification available in August 2000. As AMD was never invited to be a contributing party for the IA-64 architecture and any kind of licensing seemed unlikely, the AMD64 architecture was positioned by AMD from the beginning as an evolutionary way to add 64-bit computing capabilities to the existing x86 architecture while supporting legacy 32-bit x86 code, as opposed to Intel&#x27;s approach of creating an entirely new, completely x86-incompatible 64-bit architecture with IA-64.

The first AMD64-based processor, the Opteron, was released in April 2003.

=== Implementations ===
AMD&#x27;s processors implementing the AMD64 architecture include Opteron, Athlon 64, Athlon 64 X2, Athlon 64 FX, Athlon II (followed by &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;X3&quot;, or &quot;X4&quot; to indicate the number of cores, and XLT models), Turion 64, Turion 64 X2, Sempron (&quot;Palermo&quot; E6 stepping and all &quot;Manila&quot; models), Phenom (followed by &quot;X3&quot; or &quot;X4&quot; to indicate the number of cores), Phenom II (followed by &quot;X2&quot;, &quot;X3&quot;, &quot;X4&quot; or &quot;X6&quot; to indicate the number of cores), FX, Fusion/APU and Ryzen/Epyc.

=== Architectural features ===
The primary defining characteristic of AMD64 is the availability of 64-bit general-purpose processor registers (for example, ), 64-bit integer arithmetic and logical operations, and 64-bit virtual addresses. The designers took the opportunity to make other improvements as well.

Notable changes in the 64-bit extensions include:

; 64-bit integer capability
: All general-purpose registers (GPRs) are expanded from 32 bits to 64 bits, and all arithmetic and logical operations, memory-to-register and register-to-memory operations, etc., can operate directly on 64-bit integers. Pushes and pops on the stack default to 8-byte strides, and pointers are 8 bytes wide.
; Additional registers
: In addition to increasing the size of the general-purpose registers, the number of named general-purpose registers is increased from eight (i.e. , , , , , , , ) in x86 to 16 (i.e. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ). It is therefore possible to keep more local variables in registers rather than on the stack, and to let registers hold frequently accessed constants; arguments for small and fast subroutines may also be passed in registers to a greater extent.
: AMD64 still has fewer registers than many RISC instruction sets (e.g. Power ISA has 32 GPRs; 64-bit ARM, RISC-V I, SPARC, Alpha, MIPS, and PA-RISC have 31) or VLIW-like machines such as the IA-64 (which has 128 registers). However, an AMD64 implementation may have far more internal registers than the number of architectural registers exposed by the instruction set (see register renaming). (For example, AMD Zen cores have 168 64-bit integer and 160 128-bit vector floating-point physical internal registers.)
; Additional XMM (SSE) registers
: Similarly, the number of 128-bit XMM registers (used for Streaming SIMD instructions) is also increased from 8 to 16.
: The traditional x87 FPU register stack is not included in the register file size extension in 64-bit mode, compared with the XMM registers used by SSE2, which did get extended. The x87 register stack is not a simple register file although it does allow direct access to individual registers by low cost exchange operations.
; Larger virtual address space
: The AMD64 architecture defines a 64-bit virtual address format, of which the low-order 48 bits are used in current implementations. This allows up to 256 TiB (248 bytes) of virtual address space. The architecture definition allows this limit to be raised in future implementations to the full 64 bits, extending the virtual address space to 16 EiB (264 bytes). This is compared to just 4 GiB (232 bytes) for the x86.
: This means that very large files can be operated on by mapping the entire file into the process&#x27;s address space (which is often much faster than working with file read/write calls), rather than having to map regions of the file into and out of the address space.
; Larger physical address space
: The original implementation of the AMD64 architecture implemented 40-bit physical addresses and so could address up to 1 TiB (240 bytes) of RAM. Current implementations of the AMD64 architecture (starting from AMD 10h microarchitecture) extend this to 48-bit physical addresses and therefore can address up to 256 TiB (248 bytes) of RAM. The architecture permits extending this to 52 bits in the future (limited by the page table entry format); this would allow addressing of up to 4 PiB of RAM. For comparison, 32-bit x86 processors are limited to 64 GiB of RAM in Physical Address Extension (PAE) mode, or 4 GiB of RAM without PAE mode.
; Larger physical address space in legacy mode
: When operating in legacy mode the AMD64 architecture supports Physical Address Extension (PAE) mode, as do most current x86 processors, but AMD64 extends PAE from 36 bits to an architectural limit of 52 bits of physical address. Any implementation, therefore, allows the same physical address limit as under long mode.
; Instruction pointer relative data access
: Instructions can now reference data relative to the instruction pointer (RIP register). This makes position-independent code, as is often used in shared libraries and code loaded at run time, more efficient.
; SSE instructions
: The original AMD64 architecture adopted Intel&#x27;s SSE and SSE2 as core instructions. These instruction sets provide a vector supplement to the scalar x87 FPU, for the single-precision and double-precision data types. SSE2 also offers integer vector operations, for data types ranging from 8bit to 64bit precision. This makes the vector capabilities of the architecture on par with those of the most advanced x86 processors of its time. These instructions can also be used in 32-bit mode. The proliferation of 64-bit processors has made these vector capabilities ubiquitous in home computers, allowing the improvement of the standards of 32-bit applications. The 32-bit edition of Windows 8, for example, requires the presence of SSE2 instructions. SSE3 instructions and later Streaming SIMD Extensions instruction sets are not standard features of the architecture.
; No-Execute bit
: The No-Execute bit or NX bit (bit 63 of the page table entry) allows the operating system to specify which pages of virtual address space can contain executable code and which cannot. An attempt to execute code from a page tagged &quot;no execute&quot; will result in a memory access violation, similar to an attempt to write to a read-only page. This should make it more difficult for malicious code to take control of the system via &quot;buffer overrun&quot; or &quot;unchecked buffer&quot; attacks. A similar feature has been available on x86 processors since the 80286 as an attribute of segment descriptors; however, this works only on an entire segment at a time.
: Segmented addressing has long been considered an obsolete mode of operation, and all current PC operating systems in effect bypass it, setting all segments to a base address of zero and (in their 32-bit implementation) a size of 4 GiB. AMD was the first x86-family vendor to implement no-execute in linear addressing mode. The feature is also available in legacy mode on AMD64 processors, and recent Intel x86 processors, when PAE is used.
; Removal of older features
: A few &quot;system programming&quot; features of the x86 architecture were either unused or underused in modern operating systems and are either not available on AMD64 in long (64-bit and compatibility) mode, or exist only in limited form. These include segmented addressing (although the FS and GS segments are retained in vestigial form for use as extra-base pointers to operating system structures), the task state switch mechanism, and virtual 8086 mode. These features remain fully implemented in &quot;legacy mode&quot;, allowing these processors to run 32-bit and 16-bit operating systems without modifications. Some instructions that proved to be rarely useful are not supported in 64-bit mode, including saving/restoring of segment registers on the stack, saving/restoring of all registers (PUSHA/POPA), decimal arithmetic, BOUND and INTO instructions, and &quot;far&quot; jumps and calls with immediate operands.

=== Virtual address space details ===
==== Canonical form addresses ====
Although virtual addresses are 64 bits wide in 64-bit mode, current implementations (and all chips that are known to be in the planning stages) do not allow the entire virtual address space of 264 bytes (16 EiB) to be used. This would be approximately four billion times the size of the virtual address space on 32-bit machines. Most operating systems and applications will not need such a large address space for the foreseeable future, so implementing such wide virtual addresses would simply increase the complexity and cost of address translation with no real benefit. AMD, therefore, decided that, in the first implementations of the architecture, only the least significant 48 bits of a virtual address would actually be used in address translation (page table lookup).

In addition, the AMD specification requires that the most significant 16 bits of any virtual address, bits 48 through 63, must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to sign extension). If this requirement is not met, the processor will raise an exception. Addresses complying with this rule are referred to as &quot;canonical form.&quot; Canonical form addresses run from 0 through 00007FFF&#x27;FFFFFFFF, and from FFFF8000&#x27;00000000 through FFFFFFFF&#x27;FFFFFFFF, for a total of 256 TiB of usable virtual address space. This is still 65,536 times larger than the virtual 4 GiB address space of 32-bit machines.

This feature eases later scalability to true 64-bit addressing. Many operating systems (including, but not limited to, the Windows NT family) take the higher-addressed half of the address space (named kernel space) for themselves and leave the lower-addressed half (user space) for application code, user mode stacks, heaps, and other data regions. The &quot;canonical address&quot; design ensures that every AMD64 compliant implementation has, in effect, two memory halves: the lower half starts at 00000000&#x27;00000000 and &quot;grows upwards&quot; as more virtual address bits become available, while the higher half is &quot;docked&quot; to the top of the address space and grows downwards. Also, enforcing the &quot;canonical form&quot; of addresses by checking the unused address bits prevents their use by the operating system in tagged pointers as flags, privilege markers, etc., as such use could become problematic when the architecture is extended to implement more virtual address bits.

The first versions of Windows for x64 did not even use the full 256 TiB; they were restricted to just 8 TiB of user space and 8 TiB of kernel space. Windows did not support the entire 48-bit address space until Windows 8.1, which was released in October 2013. 

==== Page table structure ====

The 64-bit addressing mode (&quot;long mode&quot;) is a superset of Physical Address Extensions (PAE); because of this, page sizes may be 4 KiB (212 bytes) or 2 MiB (221 bytes). Long mode also supports page sizes of 1 GiB (230 bytes). Rather than the three-level page table system used by systems in PAE mode, systems running in long mode use four levels of page table: PAE&#x27;s &quot;Page-Directory Pointer Table&quot; is extended from four entries to 512, and an additional &quot;Page-Map Level 4 (PML4) Table&quot; is added, containing 512 entries in 48-bit implementations. A full mapping hierarchy of 4 KiB pages for the whole 48-bit space would take a bit more than 512 GiB of memory (about 0.195% of the 256 TiB virtual space).

Intel has implemented a scheme with a 5-level page table, which allows Intel 64 processors to support 57-bit addresses, and in turn, a 128 PiB virtual address space. Further extensions may allow full 64-bit virtual address space and physical memory with 12-bit page table descriptors and 16- or 21-bit memory offsets for 64 KiB and 2 MiB page allocation sizes; the page table entry would be expanded to 128 bits to support additional hardware flags for page size and virtual address space size.

==== Operating system limits ====
The operating system can also limit the virtual address space. Details, where applicable, are given in the &quot;Operating system compatibility and characteristics&quot; section.

=== Physical address space details ===
Current AMD64 processors support a physical address space of up to 248 bytes of RAM, or 256 TiB. However, , there were no known x86-64 motherboards that support 256 TiB of RAM. The operating system may place additional limits on the amount of RAM that is usable or supported. Details on this point are given in the &quot;Operating system compatibility and characteristics&quot; section of this article.

=== Operating modes ===
The architecture has two primary modes of operation: long mode and legacy mode.

==== Long mode ====
Long mode is the architecture&#x27;s intended primary mode of operation; it is a combination of the processor&#x27;s native 64-bit mode and a combined 32-bit and 16-bit compatibility mode. It is used by 64-bit operating systems. Under a 64-bit operating system, 64-bit programs run under 64-bit mode, and 32-bit and 16-bit protected mode applications (that do not need to use either real mode or virtual 8086 mode in order to execute at any time) run under compatibility mode. Real-mode programs and programs that use virtual 8086 mode at any time cannot be run in long mode unless those modes are emulated in software. However, such programs may be started from an operating system running in long mode on processors supporting VT-x or AMD-V by creating a virtual processor running in the desired mode.

Since the basic instruction set is the same, there is almost no performance penalty for executing protected mode x86 code. This is unlike Intel&#x27;s IA-64, where differences in the underlying instruction set mean that running 32-bit code must be done either in emulation of x86 (making the process slower) or with a dedicated x86 coprocessor. However, on the x86-64 platform, many x86 applications could benefit from a 64-bit recompile, due to the additional registers in 64-bit code and guaranteed SSE2-based FPU support, which a compiler can use for optimization. However, applications that regularly handle integers wider than 32 bits, such as cryptographic algorithms, will need a rewrite of the code handling the huge integers in order to take advantage of the 64-bit registers.

==== Legacy mode ====
Legacy mode is the mode that the processor is in when it is not in long mode. In this mode, the processor acts like an older x86 processor, and only 16-bit and 32-bit code can be executed. Legacy mode allows for a maximum of 32 bit virtual addressing which limits the virtual address space to 4 GiB. 64-bit programs cannot be run from legacy mode.

===== Protected mode =====
Protected mode is made into a submode of legacy mode. It is the submode that 32-bit operating systems and 16-bit protected mode operating systems operate in when running on an x86-64 CPU.

===== Real mode =====
Real mode is the initial mode of operation when the processor is initialized, and is a submode of legacy mode. It is backwards compatible with the original Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 processors. Real mode is primarily used today by operating system bootloaders, which are required by the architecture to configure virtual memory details before transitioning to higher modes. This mode is also used by any operating system that needs to communicate with the system firmware with a traditional BIOS-style interface.

== Intel 64 ==
Intel 64 is Intel&#x27;s implementation of x86-64, used and implemented in various processors made by Intel.

=== History ===
Historically, AMD has developed and produced processors with instruction sets patterned after Intel&#x27;s original designs, but with x86-64, roles were reversed: Intel found itself in the position of adopting the ISA that AMD created as an extension to Intel&#x27;s own x86 processor line.

Intel&#x27;s project was originally codenamed &quot;Yamhill&quot; (after the Yamhill River in Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley). After several years of denying its existence, Intel announced at the February 2004 IDF that the project was indeed underway. Intel&#x27;s chairman at the time, Craig Barrett, admitted that this was one of their worst-kept secrets.

Intel&#x27;s name for this instruction set has changed several times. The name used at the IDF was &quot;CT&quot; (presumably for &quot;Clackamas Technology&quot;, another codename from an Oregon river); within weeks they began referring to it as &quot;IA-32e&quot; (for IA-32 extensions) and in March 2004 unveiled the &quot;official&quot; name &quot;EM64T&quot; (Extended Memory 64 Technology). In late 2006 Intel began instead using the name &quot;Intel 64&quot; for its implementation, paralleling AMD&#x27;s use of the name AMD64.

The first processor to implement Intel 64 was the multi-socket processor Xeon code-named &quot;Nocona&quot; in June 2004. In contrast, the initial Prescott chips (February 2004) did not enable this feature. Intel subsequently began selling Intel 64-enabled Pentium 4s using the E0 revision of the Prescott core, being sold on the OEM market as the Pentium 4, model F. The E0 revision also adds eXecute Disable (XD) (Intel&#x27;s name for the NX bit) to Intel 64, and has been included in then current Xeon code-named &quot;Irwindale&quot;. Intel&#x27;s official launch of Intel 64 (under the name EM64T at that time) in mainstream desktop processors was the N0 stepping Prescott-2M.

The first Intel mobile processor implementing Intel 64 is the Merom version of the Core 2 processor, which was released on July 27, 2006. None of Intel&#x27;s earlier notebook CPUs (Core Duo, Pentium M, Celeron M, Mobile Pentium 4) implement Intel 64.

=== Implementations ===
Intel&#x27;s processors implementing the Intel64 architecture include the Pentium 4 F-series/5x1 series, 506, and 516, Celeron D models 3x1, 3x6, 355, 347, 352, 360, and 365 and all later Celerons, all models of Xeon since &quot;Nocona&quot;, all models of Pentium Dual-Core processors since &quot;Merom-2M&quot;, the Atom 230, 330, D410, D425, D510, D525, N450, N455, N470, N475, N550, N570, N2600 and N2800, all versions of the Pentium D, Pentium Extreme Edition, Core 2, Core i9, Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 processors, and the Xeon Phi 7200 series processors.

=== X86S ===
X86S was a simplification of x86-64 first proposed by Intel in May 2023. The new architecture would have removed support for 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems, although 32-bit programs would still run under a 64-bit OS. A compliant CPU would have no longer had legacy mode, and started directly in 64-bit long mode. There would have been a way to switch to 5-level paging without going through the unpaged mode. Specific removed features included:

* Segmentation gates
* 32-bit ring 0
** VT-x will no longer emulate this feature 
* Rings 1 and 2
* Ring 3 I/O port (/) access; see port-mapped I/O
* String port I/O (/)
* Real mode (including huge real mode), 16-bit protected mode, VM86
* 16-bit addressing mode
** VT-x will no longer provide unrestricted mode
* 8259 support; the only APIC supported would be X2APIC
* Some unused operating system mode bits
* 16-bit and 32-bit Startup IPI (SIPI)
The draft specification received multiple updates, reaching version 1.2 by June 2024. It was eventually abandoned as of December 2024, following the formation of the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group by Intel and AMD.

=== Advanced Performance Extensions ===
Advanced Performance Extensions is a 2023 Intel proposal for new instructions and an additional 16 general-purpose registers.

== VIA&#x27;s x86-64 implementation ==
VIA Technologies introduced their first implementation of the x86-64 architecture in 2008 after five years of development by its CPU division, Centaur Technology.
Codenamed &quot;Isaiah&quot;, the 64-bit architecture was unveiled on January 24, 2008, and launched on May 29 under the VIA Nano brand name.

The processor supports a number of VIA-specific x86 extensions designed to boost efficiency in low-power appliances.
It is expected that the Isaiah architecture will be twice as fast in integer performance and four times as fast in floating-point performance as the previous-generation VIA Esther at an equivalent clock speed. Power consumption is also expected to be on par with the previous-generation VIA CPUs, with thermal design power ranging from 5 W to 25 W.
Being a completely new design, the Isaiah architecture was built with support for features like the x86-64 instruction set and x86 virtualization which were unavailable on its predecessors, the VIA C7 line, while retaining their encryption extensions.

== Microarchitecture levels ==
In 2020, through a collaboration between AMD, Intel, Red Hat, and SUSE, three microarchitecture levels (or feature levels) on top of the x86-64 baseline were defined: x86-64-v2, x86-64-v3, and x86-64-v4. These levels define specific features that can be targeted by programmers to provide compile-time optimizations. The features exposed by each level are as follows:

The x86-64 microarchitecture feature levels can also be found as AMD64-v1, AMD64-v2 .. or AMD64_v1 .. in settings where the &quot;AMD64&quot; nomenclature is used. These are used as synonyms with the x86-64-vX nomenclature and are thus functionally identical. E.g. the Go language documentation or the Fedora linux distribution.

All levels include features found in the previous levels. Instruction set extensions not concerned with general-purpose computation, including AES-NI and RDRAND, are excluded from the level requirements.

On any x86_64 Linux distribution, all x86_64 feature levels supported by a CPU can be verified using command: codice_1 The result will be visible at the end of command&#x27;s output:

Subdirectories of glibc-hwcaps directories, in priority order:
x86-64-v4
x86-64-v3 (supported, searched)
x86-64-v2 (supported, searched)

Here x86-64-v4 feature level is not supported by CPU, but x86-64-v3 and x86-64-v2 are, which means this CPU does not support AVX512 required at v4 level.

== Differences between AMD64 and Intel 64 ==
Although nearly identical, there are some differences between the two instruction sets in the semantics of a few seldom used machine instructions (or situations), which are mainly used for system programming. Unless instructed to otherwise via codice_2 settings, compilers generally produce executables (i.e. machine code) that avoid any differences, at least for ordinary application programs. This is therefore of interest mainly to developers of compilers, operating systems and similar, which must deal with individual and special system instructions.

=== Recent implementations ===
* Intel 64 allows codice_3/codice_4 only in 64-bit mode (not in compatibility mode), and allows codice_5/codice_6 in both modes. AMD64 lacks codice_5/codice_6 in both sub-modes of long mode.
* When returning to a non-canonical address using codice_4, AMD64 processors execute the general protection fault handler in privilege level 3, while on Intel 64 processors it is executed in privilege level 0.
* AMD64 requires a different microcode update format and control MSRs (model-specific registers), while Intel 64 implements microcode update unchanged from their 32-bit only processors.
* Intel 64 lacks some MSRs that are considered architectural in AMD64. These include codice_10, codice_11, and codice_12.
* Intel 64 lacks the ability to save and restore a reduced (and thus faster) version of the floating-point state (involving the codice_13 and codice_14 instructions).
* In 64-bit mode, near branches with the 66H (operand size override) prefix behave differently. Intel 64 ignores this prefix: the instruction has a 32-bit sign extended offset, and instruction pointer is not truncated. AMD64 uses a 16-bit offset field in the instruction, and clears the top 48 bits of instruction pointer.
* On Intel 64 but not AMD64, the codice_15 prefix can be used with the far-pointer instructions (codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, , ) to increase the size of their far pointer argument to 80 bits (64-bit offset + 16-bit segment).
* When the codice_19 instruction is executed with a memory source operand and an operand-size of 16 bits, the memory operand will be accessed with a 16-bit read on Intel 64, but a 32-bit read on AMD64.
* The codice_20/codice_21/codice_22/codice_23 (x87 floating-point compare) instructions will clear the OF, SF and AF bits of EFLAGS on Intel 64, but leave these flag bits unmodified on AMD64. 
* For the codice_24/codice_25/codice_26/codice_27 (AVX/AVX2 masked move to/from memory) instructions, Intel 64 architecturally guarantees that the instructions will not cause memory faults (e.g. page-faults and segmentation-faults) for any zero-masked lanes, while AMD64 does not provide such a guarantee.
* If the codice_28 instruction fails to obtain a random number (as indicated by EFLAGS.CF=0), the destination register is architecturally guaranteed to be set to 0 on Intel 64 but not AMD64.
* For the codice_29 and codice_30 (AVX vector lane insert/extract) instructions outside 64-bit mode, AMD64 requires the instructions to be encoded with VEX.W=0, while Intel 64 also accepts encodings with VEX.W=1. (In 64-bit mode, both AMD64 and Intel 64 require VEX.W=0.)
* The codice_31 opcode with the ModR/M byte&#x27;s Mod field set to codice_32 is a Reserved-NOP on Intel 64 but will cause #UD (invalid-opcode exception) on AMD64. 
* The ordering guarantees provided by some memory ordering instructions such as codice_33 and codice_34 differ between Intel 64 and AMD64:
** codice_33 is dispatch-serializing (enabling it to be used as a speculation fence) on Intel 64 but is not architecturally guaranteed to be dispatch-serializing on AMD64.
** codice_34 is a fully serializing instruction (including instruction fetch serialization) on AMD64 but not Intel 64.
** The codice_37 to CR8 and codice_38 instructions are serializing on AMD64 but not Intel 64.
** The codice_39 instruction is serializing on Intel 64 but not AMD64.

=== Older implementations ===

* The AMD64 processors prior to Revision F (distinguished by the switch from DDR to DDR2 memory and new sockets AM2, F and S1) of 2006 lacked the codice_40 instruction, which is an extension of the codice_41 instruction present on most post-80486 processors. Similar to codice_41, codice_40 allows for atomic operations on octa-words (128-bit values). This is useful for parallel algorithms that use compare and swap on data larger than the size of a pointer, common in lock-free and wait-free algorithms. Without codice_40 one must use workarounds, such as a critical section or alternative lock-free approaches. Its absence also prevents 64-bit Windows prior to Windows 8.1 from having a user-mode address space larger than 8 TiB. The 64-bit version of Windows 8.1 requires the instruction.
* Early AMD64 and Intel 64 CPUs lacked codice_45 and codice_46 instructions in 64-bit mode. AMD introduced these instructions (also in 64-bit mode) with their 90 nm (revision D) processors, starting with Athlon 64 in October 2004. Intel introduced the instructions in October 2005 with the 0F47h and later revisions of NetBurst. The 64-bit version of Windows 8.1 requires this feature.
* Early Intel CPUs with Intel 64 also lack the NX bit of the AMD64 architecture. It was added in the stepping E0 (0F41h) Pentium 4 in October 2004. This feature is required by all versions of Windows 8.
* Early Intel 64 implementations had a 36-bit (64 GiB) physical addressing of memory while original AMD64 implementations had a 40-bit (1 TiB) physical addressing. Intel used the 40-bit physical addressing first on Xeon MP (Potomac), launched on 29 March 2005. The difference is not a difference of the user-visible ISAs. In 2007 AMD 10h-based Opteron was the first to provide a 48-bit (256 TiB) physical address space. Intel 64&#x27;s physical addressing was extended to 44 bits (16 TiB) in Nehalem-EX in 2010 and to 46 bits (64 TiB) in Sandy Bridge E in 2011. With the Ice Lake 3rd gen Xeon Scalable processors, Intel increased the virtual addressing to 57 bits (128 PiB) and physical to 52 bits (4 PiB) in 2021, necessitating a 5-level paging. The following year AMD64 added the same in 4th generation EPYC (Genoa). Non-server CPUs retain smaller address spaces for longer.
* On all AMD64 processors, the codice_47 and codice_48 instructions will, when given a source value of 0, leave their destination register unmodified. This is mostly the case on Intel 64 processors as well, except that on some older Intel 64 CPUs, executing these instructions with an operand size of 32 bits will clear the top 32 bits of their destination register even with a source value of 0 (with the low 32 bits kept unchanged.)
* AMD64 processors since Opteron Rev. E and Athlon 64 Rev. D reintroduced limited support for segmentation, via the Long Mode Segment Limit Enable (LMSLE) bit, to ease virtualization of 64-bit guests. LMLSE support was removed in the Zen 3 processor. 
* On all Intel 64 processors, codice_49 is ordered with respect to codice_50 - this is also the case on newer AMD64 processors (Zen 1 and later). On older AMD64 processors, imposing ordering on the codice_49 instruction instead required codice_34.

== Adoption ==
In supercomputers tracked by TOP500, the appearance of 64-bit extensions for the x86 architecture enabled 64-bit x86 processors by AMD and Intel to replace most RISC processor architectures previously used in such systems (including PA-RISC, SPARC, Alpha and others), as well as 32-bit x86, even though Intel itself initially tried unsuccessfully to replace x86 with a new incompatible 64-bit architecture in the Itanium processor.

, a HPE EPYC-based supercomputer called Frontier is number one. The first ARM-based supercomputer appeared on the list in 2018 and, in recent years, non-CPU architecture co-processors (GPGPU) have also played a big role in performance. Intel&#x27;s Xeon Phi &quot;Knights Corner&quot; coprocessors, which implement a subset of x86-64 with some vector extensions, are also used, along with x86-64 processors, in the Tianhe-2 supercomputer.
== Operating system compatibility and characteristics ==
The following operating systems and releases support the x86-64 architecture in long mode.

=== BSD ===
==== DragonFly BSD ====
Preliminary infrastructure work was started in February 2004 for a x86-64 port. This development later stalled. Development started again during July 2007
and continued during Google Summer of Code 2008 and SoC 2009. The first official release to contain x86-64 support was version 2.4.

==== FreeBSD ====
FreeBSD first added x86-64 support under the name &quot;amd64&quot; as an experimental architecture in 5.1-RELEASE in June 2003. It was included as a standard distribution architecture as of 5.2-RELEASE in January 2004. Since then, FreeBSD has designated it as a Tier 1 platform. The 6.0-RELEASE version cleaned up some quirks with running x86 executables under amd64, and most drivers work just as they do on the x86 architecture. Work is currently being done to integrate more fully the x86 application binary interface (ABI), in the same manner as the Linux 32-bit ABI compatibility currently works.

==== NetBSD ====
x86-64 architecture support was first committed to the NetBSD source tree on June 19, 2001. As of NetBSD 2.0, released on December 9, 2004, &quot;NetBSD/amd64&quot; is a fully integrated and supported port.
32-bit code is still supported in 64-bit mode, with a netbsd-32 kernel compatibility layer for 32-bit syscalls. The NX bit is used to provide non-executable stack and heap with per-page granularity (segment granularity being used on 32-bit x86).

==== OpenBSD ====
OpenBSD has supported AMD64 since OpenBSD 3.5, released on May 1, 2004. Complete in-tree implementation of AMD64 support was achieved prior to the hardware&#x27;s initial release because AMD had loaned several machines for the project&#x27;s hackathon that year. OpenBSD developers have taken to the platform because of its support for the NX bit, which allowed for an easy implementation of the W^X feature.

The code for the AMD64 port of OpenBSD also runs on Intel 64 processors which contains cloned use of the AMD64 extensions, but since Intel left out the page table NX bit in early Intel 64 processors, there is no W^X capability on those Intel CPUs; later Intel 64 processors added the NX bit under the name &quot;XD bit&quot;. Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) works on OpenBSD&#x27;s AMD64 port, starting with release 3.6 on November 1, 2004.

=== DOS ===

It is possible to enter long mode under DOS without a DOS extender, but the user must return to real mode in order to call BIOS or DOS interrupts.

It may also be possible to enter long mode with a DOS extender similar to DOS/4GW, but more complex since x86-64 lacks virtual 8086 mode. DOS itself is not aware of that, and no benefits should be expected unless running DOS in an emulation with an adequate virtualization driver backend, for example: the mass storage interface.

=== Linux ===
Linux was the first operating system kernel to run the x86-64 architecture in long mode, starting with the 2.4 version in 2001 (preceding the hardware&#x27;s availability). Linux also provides backward compatibility for running 32-bit executables. This permits programs to be recompiled into long mode while retaining the use of 32-bit programs. Current Linux distributions ship with x86-64-native kernels and userlands. Some, such as Arch Linux, SUSE, Mandriva, and Debian, allow users to install a set of 32-bit components and libraries when installing off a 64-bit distribution medium, thus allowing most existing 32-bit applications to run alongside the 64-bit OS.

x32 ABI (Application Binary Interface), introduced in Linux 3.4, allows programs compiled for the x32 ABI to run in the 64-bit mode of x86-64 while only using 32-bit pointers and data fields.
Though this limits the program to a virtual address space of 4 GiB, it also decreases the memory footprint of the program and in some cases can allow it to run faster.

64-bit Linux allows up to 128 TiB of virtual address space for individual processes, and can address approximately 64 TiB of physical memory, subject to processor and system limitations, or up to 128 PiB (virtual) and 4 PiB (physical) with 5-level paging enabled.

=== macOS ===
Mac OS X 10.4.7 and higher versions of Mac OS X 10.4 run 64-bit command-line tools using the POSIX and math libraries on 64-bit Intel-based machines, just as all versions of Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 run them on 64-bit PowerPC machines. No other libraries or frameworks work with 64-bit applications in Mac OS X 10.4.
The kernel, and all kernel extensions, are 32-bit only.

Mac OS X 10.5 supports 64-bit GUI applications using Cocoa, Quartz, OpenGL, and X11 on 64-bit Intel-based machines, as well as on 64-bit PowerPC machines.
All non-GUI libraries and frameworks also support 64-bit applications on those platforms. The kernel, and all kernel extensions, are 32-bit only.

Mac OS X 10.6 is the first version of macOS that supports a 64-bit kernel. However, not all 64-bit computers can run the 64-bit kernel, and not all 64-bit computers that can run the 64-bit kernel will do so by default.
The 64-bit kernel, like the 32-bit kernel, supports 32-bit applications; both kernels also support 64-bit applications. 32-bit applications have a virtual address space limit of 4 GiB under either kernel. The 64-bit kernel does not support 32-bit kernel extensions, and the 32-bit kernel does not support 64-bit kernel extensions.

OS X 10.8 includes only the 64-bit kernel, but continues to support 32-bit applications; it does not support 32-bit kernel extensions, however.

macOS 10.15 includes only the 64-bit kernel and no longer supports 32-bit applications. This removal of support has presented a problem for WineHQ (and the commercial version CrossOver), as it needs to still be able to run 32-bit Windows applications. The solution, termed &quot;wine32on64&quot;, was to add thunks that bring the CPU in and out of 32-bit compatibility mode in the nominally 64-bit application.

macOS uses the universal binary format to package 32- and 64-bit versions of application and library code into a single file; the most appropriate version is automatically selected at load time. In Mac OS X 10.6, the universal binary format is also used for the kernel and for those kernel extensions that support both 32-bit and 64-bit kernels.

=== Solaris ===

Solaris 10 and later releases support the x86-64 architecture.

For Solaris 10, just as with the SPARC architecture, there is only one operating system image, which contains a 32-bit kernel and a 64-bit kernel; this is labeled as the &quot;x64/x86&quot; DVD-ROM image. The default behavior is to boot a 64-bit kernel, allowing both 64-bit and existing or new 32-bit executables to be run. A 32-bit kernel can also be manually selected, in which case only 32-bit executables will run. The codice_53 command can be used to determine if a system is running a 64-bit kernel.

For Solaris 11, only the 64-bit kernel is provided. However, the 64-bit kernel supports both 32- and 64-bit executables, libraries, and system calls.

=== Windows ===
x64 editions of Microsoft Windows client and server—Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition—were released in March 2005. Internally they are actually the same build (5.2.3790.1830 SP1), as they share the same source base and operating system binaries, so even system updates are released in unified packages, much in the manner as Windows 2000 Professional and Server editions for x86. Windows Vista, which also has many different editions, was released in January 2007. Windows 7 was released in July 2009. Windows Server 2008 R2 was sold in only x64 and Itanium editions; later versions of Windows Server only offer an x64 edition.

Versions of Windows for x64 prior to Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 offer the following:
* 8 TiB of virtual address space per process, accessible from both user mode and kernel mode, referred to as the user mode address space. An x64 program can use all of this, subject to backing store limits on the system, and provided it is linked with the &quot;large address aware&quot; option, which is present by default. This is a 4096-fold increase over the default 2 GiB user-mode virtual address space offered by 32-bit Windows.
* 8 TiB of kernel mode virtual address space for the operating system. As with the user mode address space, this is a 4096-fold increase over 32-bit Windows versions. The increased space primarily benefits the file system cache and kernel mode &quot;heaps&quot; (non-paged pool and paged pool). Windows only uses a total of 16 TiB out of the 256 TiB implemented by the processors because early AMD64 processors lacked a codice_40 instruction.

Under Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, both user mode and kernel mode virtual address spaces have been extended to 128 TiB. These versions of Windows will not install on processors that lack the codice_40 instruction.

The following additional characteristics apply to all x64 versions of Windows:

* Ability to run existing 32-bit applications (codice_56 programs) and dynamic link libraries (codice_57s) using WoW64 if WoW64 is supported on that version. Furthermore, a 32-bit program, if it was linked with the &quot;large address aware&quot; option, can use up to 4 GiB of virtual address space in 64-bit Windows, instead of the default 2 GiB (optional 3 GiB with codice_58 boot option and &quot;large address aware&quot; link option) offered by 32-bit Windows. Unlike the use of the codice_58 boot option on x86, this does not reduce the kernel mode virtual address space available to the operating system. 32-bit applications can, therefore, benefit from running on x64 Windows even if they are not recompiled for x86-64.
* Both 32- and 64-bit applications, if not linked with &quot;large address aware&quot;, are limited to 2 GiB of virtual address space.
* Ability to use up to 128 GiB (Windows XP/Vista), 192 GiB (Windows 7), 512 GiB (Windows 8), 1 TiB (Windows Server 2003), 2 TiB (Windows Server 2008/Windows 10), 4 TiB (Windows Server 2012), or 24 TiB (Windows Server 2016/2019) of physical random access memory (RAM).
* LLP64 data model: in C/C++, &quot;int&quot; and &quot;long&quot; types are 32 bits wide, &quot;long long&quot; is 64 bits, while pointers and types derived from pointers are 64 bits wide.
* Kernel mode device drivers must be 64-bit versions; there is no way to run 32-bit kernel mode executables within the 64-bit operating system. User mode device drivers can be either 32-bit or 64-bit.
* 16-bit Windows (Win16) and DOS applications will not run on x86-64 versions of Windows due to the removal of the virtual DOS machine subsystem (NTVDM) which relied upon the ability to use virtual 8086 mode. Virtual 8086 mode cannot be entered while running in long mode.
* Full implementation of the NX (No Execute) page protection feature. This is also implemented on recent 32-bit versions of Windows when they are started in PAE mode.
* Instead of FS segment descriptor on x86 versions of the Windows NT family, GS segment descriptor is used to point to two operating system defined structures: Thread Information Block (NT_TIB) in user mode and Processor Control Region (KPCR) in kernel mode. Thus, for example, in user mode codice_60 is the address of the first member of the Thread Information Block. Maintaining this convention made the x86-64 port easier, but required AMD to retain the function of the FS and GS segments in long mode – even though segmented addressing &quot;per se&quot; is not really used by any modern operating system.
* Early reports claimed that the operating system scheduler would not save and restore the x87 FPU machine state across thread context switches. Observed behavior shows that this is not the case: the x87 state is saved and restored, except for kernel mode-only threads (a limitation that exists in the 32-bit version as well). The most recent documentation available from Microsoft states that the x87/MMX/3DNow! instructions may be used in long mode, but that they are deprecated and may cause compatibility problems in the future. (3DNow! is no longer available on AMD processors, with the exception of the codice_61 and codice_62 instructions, which are also supported on Intel processors as of Broadwell.)
* Some components like Jet Database Engine and Data Access Objects will not be ported to 64-bit architectures such as x86-64 and IA-64.
* Microsoft Visual Studio can compile native applications to target either the x86-64 architecture, which can run only on 64-bit Microsoft Windows, or the IA-32 architecture, which can run as a 32-bit application on 32-bit Microsoft Windows or 64-bit Microsoft Windows in WoW64 emulation mode. Managed applications can be compiled either in IA-32, x86-64 or AnyCPU modes. Software created in the first two modes behave like their IA-32 or x86-64 native code counterparts respectively; When using the AnyCPU mode, however, applications in 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows run as 32-bit applications, while they run as a 64-bit application in 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows.

== Video game consoles ==
The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One use AMD x86-64 processors based on the Jaguar microarchitecture. Firmware and games are written in x86-64 code; no legacy x86 code is involved. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S use AMD x86-64 processors based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture. The Steam Deck uses a custom AMD x86-64 accelerated processing unit (APU) based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture.

== Industry naming conventions ==
Since AMD64 and Intel 64 are substantially similar, many software and hardware products use one vendor-neutral term to indicate their compatibility with both implementations. AMD&#x27;s original designation for this processor architecture, &quot;x86-64&quot;, is still used for this purpose, as is the variant &quot;x86_64&quot;. Other companies, such as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems/Oracle Corporation, use the contraction &quot;x64&quot; in marketing material.

The term IA-64 refers to the Itanium processor, and should not be confused with x86-64, as it is a completely different instruction set.

Many operating systems and products, especially those that introduced x86-64 support prior to Intel&#x27;s entry into the market, use the term &quot;AMD64&quot; or &quot;amd64&quot; to refer to both AMD64 and Intel 64.
* amd64
** Most BSD systems such as FreeBSD, MidnightBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD refer to both AMD64 and Intel 64 under the architecture name &quot;amd64&quot;.
** Some Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo Linux refer to both AMD64 and Intel 64 under the architecture name &quot;amd64&quot;.
** Microsoft Windows&#x27;s x64 versions use the AMD64 moniker internally to designate various components which use or are compatible with this architecture. For example, the environment variable PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is assigned the value &quot;AMD64&quot; as opposed to &quot;x86&quot; in 32-bit versions, and the system directory on a Windows x64 Edition installation CD-ROM is named &quot;AMD64&quot;, in contrast to &quot;i386&quot; in 32-bit versions.
** Sun&#x27;s Solaris&#x27;s &quot;isalist&quot; command identifies both AMD64- and Intel 64-based systems as &quot;amd64&quot;.
** Java Development Kit (JDK): the name &quot;amd64&quot; is used in directory names containing x86-64 files.
* x86_64
** The Linux kernel and the GNU Compiler Collection refers to 64-bit architecture as &quot;x86_64&quot;.
** Some Linux distributions, such as Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux refer to this 64-bit architecture as &quot;x86_64&quot;.
** Apple macOS refers to 64-bit architecture as &quot;x86-64&quot; or &quot;x86_64&quot;, as seen in the Terminal command codice_63 and in their developer documentation.
** Breaking with most other BSD systems, DragonFly BSD refers to 64-bit architecture as &quot;x86_64&quot;.
** Haiku refers to 64-bit architecture as &quot;x86_64&quot;.

== Licensing ==
x86-64/AMD64 was solely developed by AMD. Until April 2021 when the relevant patents expired, AMD held patents on techniques used in AMD64; those patents had to be licensed from AMD in order to implement AMD64. Intel entered into a cross-licensing agreement with AMD, licensing to AMD their patents on existing x86 techniques, and licensing from AMD their patents on techniques used in x86-64. In 2009, AMD and Intel settled several lawsuits and cross-licensing disagreements, extending their cross-licensing agreements.

<doc id="244389" wikidata="Q853213" url="?curid=244389" title="Squall">
<text>A squall is a sudden, sharp increase in wind speed lasting minutes, as opposed to a wind gust, which lasts for only seconds. They are usually associated with active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow. Squalls refer to the increase of the sustained winds over that time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event. They usually occur in a region of strong sinking air or cooling in the mid-atmosphere. These force strong localized upward motions at the leading edge of the region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.

==Etymology==
There are different versions of the word&#x27;s origins:
* By one version, the word appears to be Nordic in origin, but its etymology is considered obscure. It probably has its roots in the word &quot;skvala&quot; an Old Norse word meaning literally &quot;to squeal&quot;. 
* By another version, it is an alteration of &quot;squeal&quot; influenced by &quot;bawl&quot;.

==Character of the wind==
The term &quot;squall&quot; is used to refer to a sudden wind-speed increase lasting minutes. In 1962 the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defined that to be classified as a &quot;squall&quot;, the wind must increase at least and must attain a top speed of at least , lasting at least one minute in duration. In Australia, a squall is defined to last for several minutes before the wind returns to the long-term mean value. In either case, a squall is defined to last about half as long as the definition of sustained wind in its respective country. Usually, this sudden violent wind is associated with briefly heavy precipitation as squall line.

==Regional terms==

===Argentina===
Known locally as &quot;pamperos&quot;, these are characterized as strong downsloped winds that move across the pampas, eventually making it to the Atlantic Ocean.

===Australia===
In southeastern Australia, the colloquial name for a squall is &quot;southerly buster&quot;, which is an abrupt southerly wind change in the southern regions of New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, which approaches from the southeast, mainly on a hot day, bringing in cool, usually severe weather and a dramatic temperature drop, thus ultimately replacing and relieving the prior hot conditions. 

===Central America===
Offshore Central America, a &quot;gully squall&quot; is characterized by strong increases of the wind forced through sharp mountain valleys on the Pacific Ocean side of the isthmus.

===Cuba===
A &quot;bayamo&quot; is a squall emanating from tropical thunderstorms near the Bight of Bayamo.

===East Indies===
In the East Indies, &quot;brubu&quot; is a name for a squall

===Pacific Northwest (North America)===
In the Pacific Northwest, a &quot;squall&quot; is a short but furious rainstorm with strong winds, often small in area and moving at high speed, especially as a maritime term. A strong Katabatic outflow occurring in fjords and inlets is referred to by mariners as a &quot;squamish&quot;.

===South Africa===
&quot;Bull&#x27;s Eye Squall&quot; is a term used offshore South Africa for a squall forming in fair weather. It is named for the appearance of the small isolated cloud marking the top of the squall.

===Philippines (West Pacific)===
In most parts of the country, squalls are called &quot;subasko&quot; and are characterized by heavy rains driven by blustery winds. Local fishermen at sea are often on the lookout for signs of impending squalls on the open water and rush to shore at its early signs.

===South-East Asia===
&quot;Barat&quot; is a term for a northwest squall in Manado Bay in Sulawesi.

&quot;Sumatra squall&quot; is a term used in Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia for squall lines that form over the island of Sumatra and move east across the Straits of Malacca. Gusts can reach up to 28 m/s (100 km/h).

==Severe weather==
A &quot;squall line&quot; is an organized line of thunderstorms. It is classified as a multi-cell cluster, meaning a thunderstorm complex comprising many individual updrafts. They are also called multi-cell lines. Squalls are sometimes associated with hurricanes or other cyclones, but they can also occur independently. Most commonly, independent squalls occur along front lines, and may contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, dangerous straight line winds, and possibly funnel clouds, tornadoes and waterspouts. Squall lines require significant low-level warmth and humidity, a nearby frontal zone, and vertical wind shear from an angle behind the frontal boundary. The strong winds at the surface are usually a reflection of dry air intruding into the line of storms, which when saturated, falls quickly to ground level due to its much higher density before it spreads out downwind. Significant squall lines with multiple bow echoes are known as derechos.

===Squall line life cycle===
There are several forms of mesoscale meteorology, including simplistic isolated thunderstorms unrelated to advancing cold fronts, to the more complex daytime/nocturnal mesoscale convective system (MCS) and mesoscale convective complex (MCC), to squall line thunderstorms.

====Formation====
The main driving force behind squall line creation is attributed to the process of in-filling of multiple thunderstorms and/or a single area of thunderstorms expanding outward within the leading space of an advancing cold front.

=====Pressure perturbations=====
Pressure perturbations within an extent of a thunderstorm are noteworthy. With buoyancy rapid within the lower and mid-levels of a mature thunderstorm, one might believe that low pressure dominates in the mesoscale environment. However, this is not the case. With downdrafts ushering colder air from mid-levels, hitting ground and propagating away in all directions, high pressure is to be found widely at surface levels, usually indicative of strong (potentially damaging) winds.

=====Wind shear=====
Wind shear is an important aspect to measuring the potential of squall line severity and duration. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to turn will aid in create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.

====Evolution====

=====Updrafts=====
The leading area of a squall line is composed primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.

As thunderstorms fill into a distinct line, strong leading-edge updrafts – occasionally visible to a ground observer in the form of a shelf cloud – may appear as an ominous sign of potential severe weather.

Beyond the strong winds because of updraft/downdraft behavior, heavy rain (and hail) is another sign of a squall line. In the winter, squall lines can occur albeit less frequently – bringing heavy snow and/or thunder and lightning – usually over inland lakes (i.e. Great Lakes region).

=====Bow echoes=====
Following the initial passage of a squall line, light to moderate stratiform precipitation is also common. A bow echo is frequently seen on the northern and southernmost reaches of squall line thunderstorms (via satellite imagery). This is where the northern and southern ends curl backwards towards the middle portions of the squall line, making a &quot;bow&quot; shape. Bow echoes are frequently featured within supercell mesoscale systems.

=====Mesolow=====

The poleward end of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end, with the equatorward side rotating anticyclonically. Because of the coriolis force, the poleward end may evolve further, creating a &quot;comma shaped&quot; mesolow, or may continue in a squall-like pattern.

A wake low is another kind of mesoscale low-pressure area to the rear of a squall line near the back edge of the stratiform rain area. Due to the subsiding warm air associated with the system&#x27;s formation, clearing skies are associated with the wake low. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line is in the process of decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.

====Dissipation====
As supercells and multi-cell thunderstorms dissipate due to a weak shear force or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the squall line or gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale area of low pressure may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper-level low filling) leading to frontolysis.

From here, a general thinning of a squall line will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness.

===Signs in the sky===
Shelf clouds and roll clouds are usually seen above the leading edge of a squall, also known as a thunderstorm&#x27;s gust front. From the time these low cloud features appear in the sky, one can expect a sudden increase in the wind in less than 15 minutes.

==Tropical cyclones==
Tropical cyclones normally have squalls coincident with spiral bands of greater curvature than many mid-latitude systems due to their smaller size. These squalls can harbor waterspouts and tornadoes due to the significant vertical wind shear which exists in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone&#x27;s outer bands.

==Winter weather==
Snow squalls can be spawned by an intrusion of cold air aloft over a relatively warm surface layer. Lake-effect snows can be in the form of a snow squall.

<doc id="244391" wikidata="Q860333" url="?curid=244391" title="Flash flood">
<text>A flash flood is a rapid flooding of low-lying areas: washes, rivers, dry lakes and depressions. It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, or tropical storm, or by meltwater from ice and snow. Flash floods may also occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by having a timescale of fewer than six hours between rainfall and the onset of flooding.

Flash floods are a significant hazard, causing more fatalities in the U.S. in an average year than lightning, tornadoes, or hurricanes. They can also deposit large quantities of sediments on floodplains and destroy vegetation cover not adapted to frequent flood conditions.

== Causes ==

Flash floods most often occur in dry areas that have recently received precipitation, but they may be seen anywhere downstream from the source of the precipitation, even many miles from the source. In areas on or near volcanoes, flash floods have also occurred after eruptions, when glaciers have been melted by the intense heat. Flash floods are known to occur in the highest mountain ranges of the United States and are also common in the arid plains of the Southwestern United States. Flash flooding can also be caused by extensive rainfall released by hurricanes and other tropical storms, as well as the sudden thawing effect of ice dams. Human activities can also cause flash floods to occur. When dams fail, a large quantity of water can be released and destroy everything in its path.

== Hazards ==

The United States National Weather Service gives the advice &quot;Turn Around, Don&#x27;t Drown&quot; for flash floods; that is, it recommends that people get out of the area of a flash flood, rather than trying to cross it. Many people tend to underestimate the dangers of flash floods. What makes flash floods most dangerous is their sudden nature and fast-moving water. A vehicle provides little to no protection against being swept away; it may make people overconfident and less likely to avoid the flash flood. More than half of the fatalities attributed to flash floods are people swept away in vehicles when trying to cross flooded intersections. As little as of water is enough to carry away most SUV-sized vehicles. The U.S. National Weather Service reported in 2005 that, using a national 30-year average, more people die yearly in floods, 127 on average, than by lightning (73), tornadoes (65), or hurricanes (16).

In deserts, flash floods can be particularly deadly for several reasons. First, storms in arid regions are infrequent, but they can deliver an enormous amount of water in a very short time. Second, these rains often fall on poorly absorbent and often clay-like soil, which greatly increases the amount of runoff that rivers and other water channels have to handle. These regions tend not to have the infrastructure that wetter regions have to divert water from structures and roads, such as storm drains, culverts, and retention basins, either because of sparse population or poverty, or because residents believe the risk of flash floods is not high enough to justify the expense. In fact, in some areas, desert roads frequently cross a dry river and creek beds without bridges. From the driver&#x27;s perspective, there may be clear weather, when a river unexpectedly forms ahead of or around the vehicle in a matter of seconds. Finally, the lack of regular rain to clear water channels may cause flash floods in deserts to be headed by large amounts of debris, such as rocks, branches, and logs.

Deep slot canyons can be especially dangerous to hikers as they may be flooded by a storm that occurs on a mesa miles away. The flood sweeps through the canyon; the canyon makes it difficult to climb up and out of the way to avoid the flood. For example, a cloudburst in southern Utah on 14 September 2015 resulted in 20 flash flood fatalities, of which seven fatalities occurred at Zion National Park when hikers were trapped by floodwaters in a slot canyon.

== Impacts ==

Flash floods induce severe impacts in both the built and the natural environment. The effects of flash floods can be catastrophic and show extensive diversity, ranging from damages in buildings and infrastructure to impacts on vegetation, human lives and livestock. The effects are particularly difficult to characterize in urban areas.

Researchers have used datasets such as the Severe Hazards Analysis and Verification Experiment (SHAVE) and the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) &quot;Storm Data&quot; datasets to connect the impact of flash floods with the physical processes involved in flash flooding. This should increase the reliability of flash flood impact forecasting models. Analysis of flash floods in the United States between 2006 and 2012 shows that injuries and fatalities are most likely in small, rural catchments, that the shortest events are also the most dangerous, that the hazards are greatest after nightfall, and that a very high fraction of injuries and fatalities involve vehicles.

An impact severity scale is proposed in 2020 providing a coherent overview of the flash flood effects through the classification of impact types and severity and mapping their spatial extent in a continuous way across the floodplain. Depending on the affected elements, the flood effects are grouped into 4 categories: (i) impacts on built environment (ii) impacts on man-made mobile objects,(iii) impacts on the natural environment (including vegetation, agriculture, geomorphology, and pollution) and (iv) impacts on the human population (entrapments, injuries, fatalities). The scale was proposed as a tool on prevention planning, as the resulting maps offer insights on future impacts, highlighting the high severity areas.

Flash floods can cause rapid soil erosion. Much of the Nile delta sedimentation may come from flash flooding in the desert areas that drain into the Nile River. However, flash floods of short duration produce relatively little bedrock erosion or channel widening, having their greatest impact from sedimentation on the floodplain.

Some wetlands plants, such as certain varieties of rice, are adapted to endure flash flooding. However, plants that thrive in drier areas can be harmed by flooding, as the plants can become stressed by the large amount of water.

<text>Bohol (), officially the Province of Bohol (; ), is an island province of the Philippines located in the Central Visayas region, consisting of the island itself and 75 minor surrounding islands. It is home to Boholano people. Its capital is Tagbilaran, the largest city of the province. With a land area of and a coastline long, Bohol is the tenth largest island of the Philippines.

The province of Bohol is a first-class province divided into 3 congressional districts, comprising 1 component city and 47 municipalities. It has 1,109 barangays.

The province is a popular tourist destination with its beaches and resorts. The Chocolate Hills, numerous mounds of brown-colored limestone formations, are the most popular attraction. The formations can be seen by land (climbing the highest point) or by air via ultralight air tours. Panglao Island, located just southwest of Tagbilaran, is famous for its diving locations and is routinely listed as one of the top ten diving locations in the world. Numerous tourist resorts and dive centers dot the southern beaches. The Philippine tarsier, among the world&#x27;s smallest primates, is indigenous to the island.

It was the home province of Carlos P. Garcia, the eighth president of the Republic of the Philippines (1957–1961) who was born in Talibon, Bohol.

On October 15, 2013, Bohol was devastated by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake whose epicenter was south of Sagbayan. The earthquake, which also hit southern Cebu, claimed 222 lives altogether and injured 374 people. It also destroyed or damaged a number of Bohol&#x27;s heritage churches.

In 2023, Bohol Island was designated as a UNESCO Global Geopark, the first in the Philippines.

Bohol is also the province with the most towns in the Philippines, totalling 47 towns, and 1 component city, Tagbilaran City.

==Etymology==
Bohol is accordingly derived from the local word &quot;bo-ol&quot;, a kind of tree that flourished on the island. Similar to Nahuatl, the &quot;h&quot; in the middle was used to transcribe a glottal stop which is a common phoneme in the languages of the Philippines. The original name survives as &quot;Bool&quot;, a barangay or village in Tagbilaran City where Miguel Lopez de Legazpi supposedly landed.

==History==
===Early history===

====Late Metal Age to Protohistoric Period (3,000 B.C.)====

The region of Southeastern Bohol, particularly Cogtong Bay in Candijay and the Anda Peninsula are known as the &quot;cradle of civilization of Bohol&quot; from archaeological findings of pre-colonial petroglyphs, and ancient bodies from burial sites which were housed in boat-shaped wooden-coffins. Boat coffin burial has been found prevalent in Mindanao, Palawan, Negros, Panay, Maranduque, and Masbate as well as throughout Southeast Asia in Borneo and Vietnam. Today, local healers and shaman still practice pagdiwata rituals, or offerings to the spirits for good fortune, located in Lamanok Point in Anda. The wooden boat coffins are estimated to date back 6,000 years ago from the Metal Age to the Protohistoric Period. The National Museum of the Philippines has excavated and recorded 9 local caves for preservation. Human remains found in Southeastern Bohol also contained artificially modified crania or a form of head-binding, practiced by ancient communities throughout history.

Unfortunately, theft and extraction of sacred burial sites of human remains by U.S. universities occurred during the American colonial area, particularly conducted by the University of Michigan and Bucknell University in the 1920s. The University of Michigan has up to 22 human remains taken from Carmen and Mabini, Bohol. 

====12th to 16th century====

In the early 17th century, Father Ignacio Alcina, recorded that a certain Datung Sumanga of Leyte wooed the princess, Bugbung Humasanum, of Bohol, and married her after raiding Imperial China and aftwards were the precursors of the people there. In 1667, Father Francisco Combes, in his &quot;Historia de Mindanao&quot;, mentioned that at one time in their history, the people of the Panglao invaded Bohol and subsequently imposed their economic and political dominance in the area. They considered the previous inhabitants of the islands as their slaves by reason of war, as witnessed for example by how Datu Pagbuaya, one of the rulers of Panglao, considered Datu Sikatuna as his vassal and relative. The invasion of Bohol by the people of Panglao ushered Bo-ol. Bo-ol prospered under the reign of the two brother rulers of Panglao - Datu Dailisan and Datu Pagbuaya, with trade links established with neighbouring Southeast Asian countries, particularly with the Sultanate of Ternate. The flourishing of trade is owed to its strategic location along the busy trading channels of Cebu and Butuan. For other countries such as Ternate to gain access to the busy trade ports of the Visayas, they need to first forge diplomatic ties with the Bohol &quot;kingdom&quot;.

Relations between the Sultanate of Ternate and Bo-ol soured when the Ternatan sultan learned the sad fate of his emissary and his men who were executed by the two ruling chieftains of Bo-ol as punishment for abusing one of the concubines. Thus, in 1563, the Ternatans attacked Bohol. Twenty &quot;joangas&quot; deceitfully posing as traders were sent by the sultan of Ternate to attack Bohol. Caught unaware, the inhabitants of Bohol could not defend themselves against the Ternatan raiders who were also equipped with sophisticated firearms like muskets and arquebuses provided by the Portuguese, still unknown to Boholanos. Thousands of Boholanos lost their lives in this conflict, including Pagbuaya&#x27;s brother Datu Dailisan. After the raid, Datu Pagbuaya, who was left as the sole reigning chief of the island, decided to abandon Bohol together with the rest of the freemen as they considered Bohol island unfortunate and accursed. They settled in the northern coast of the island of Mindanao, where they established the Dapitan settlement.

Bohol is derived from the word Bo-ho or Bo-ol. The island was the seat of the first international treaty of peace and unity between the native king Datu Sikatuna and Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi on 16 March 1565, through a blood compact alliance known today by many Filipinos as the Sandugo.

=== Spanish colonial era (1500s to 1890s) ===
The earliest significant contact of the island with Spain occurred in 1565. On 16 March 1565, a Spanish explorer named Miguel López de Legazpi arrived in Bohol seeking spices and gold. After convincing the native chieftains that they were not Portuguese (who raided the islands of Mactan in 1521), Legazpi made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna. This pact was signified with a &quot;sandugo&quot; (blood compact) between the two men. This event, simply called the &quot;Sandugo&quot; (&quot;one blood&quot;), is celebrated in Bohol every year during the Sandugo Festival. The &quot;Sandugo&quot; or blood compact is also depicted on Bohol&#x27;s provincial flag and the Bohol provincial seal.

Two significant revolts occurred in Bohol during the Spanish Era. One was the Tamblot Uprising in 1621, led by Tamblot, a &quot;babaylan&quot;. This revolt met with reprisals from the Spanish forces in Cebu, who on 6 January 1635; under orders by Juan de Alcarazo the Alcalde-Mayor of Cebu, a force of 50 Spanish and 1,000 Visayan troops, battled the rebels and settled in Bohol.

The other was the famous Dagohoy Rebellion, considered the longest in Philippine history. This rebellion was led by Francisco Dagohoy, also known as Francisco Sendrijas, from 1744 to 1829.

Politically, Bohol was administered as part of &quot;Cebu Province&quot;. It was separated from Cebu on 22 July 1854, together with Siquijor. A census in 1879 found Bohol with a population of 253,103 distributed among 34 municipalities.

The culture of the Boholanos was influenced by Spain and Mexico during colonization. Many traditional dances, music, dishes and other aspects of the culture have considerable Hispanic influence.

===Philippine-American War (1899-1902)===
After the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War, the U.S. bought the entire Philippine islands. However, under the newly proclaimed independent government established by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo, which was not recognized by the U.S., Bohol was governed as a &quot;Gobierno de Canton&quot;.

During the resulting Philippine–American War, American troops peacefully took over the island in March 1899. However, in September 1900, Colonel Pedro Samson led 2,000 in rebellion, due to the harsh treatment imparted by these troops and the destruction they caused. In response to the Samson uprising, the U.S. forces pursued a &quot;Scorched-Earth&quot; policy and burned down 20 out of the 35 towns of Bohol, especially Southeastern area of towns such as Duero, Jagna and Candijay where whole barangay villages were burned down in search of freedom fighters resisting U.S. invasion to the newly independent Philippines. In Jagna, Philippine guerrillas led by Captain Gregorio &quot;Guyo&quot; Casenas planned to overtake an American garrison, unfortunately the local mayor had disclosed their plans to U.S. troops and this resulted in the Lonoy Massacre or Battle of Lonoy which U.S. troops ambushed and killed 406 Filipino soldiers while 3 Americans were killed. General Hughes led a campaign of repression in October 1901, destroying a number of towns, and threatening in December 1901 to burn Tagbilaran if the rebels did not surrender. Pantaleon E. del Rosario then negotiated the rebel to surrender. At about the same period, on 20 October 1901, Bohol was organized as a province under the provisions of of the Philippine Commission. Two years later, some of its towns were consolidated reducing its 35 municipalities to 32.

===World War II: Japanese occupation (1942-1945)===
Japanese troops landed in Tagbilaran on 17 May 1942. Boholanos struggled in a guerrilla resistance against the Japanese forces. Bohol was later liberated by the local guerrillas and the Filipino and American troops who landed on 11 April 1945.

A plaque placed on the port of Tagbilaran commemorating the liberation reads:

The convoy taking the Filipino and American liberation forces to Bohol consisted of a flotilla of six Landing Ships, (Medium)-(LSM), six Landing Craft (Infantry)-(LCI), two Landing Craft,(Medium)-(LCM), and one Landing Ship, Medium (Rocket)-[LSM(R)]. Upon arrival, the reinforced battalion combat team advanced rapidly to the east and northeast with the mission of destroying all hostile forces in Bohol. Motor patrols were immediately dispatched by Col. Considine, Task Force Commander, and combed the area to the north and east, approximately halfway across the island, but no enemies were found during the reconnaissance. Finally, an enemy group of undetermined strength was located to the north of Ginopolan in Valencia, near the Sierra-Bullones boundary.

By April 17 the Task Force was poised to strike in Ginopolan. The bulk of the Japanese force was destroyed and beaten in the ten days of action. Bohol was officially declared liberated on 25 May 1945, by Major General William H. Arnold, Commander of the Americal Division. About this time, most officers and men of the Bohol Area Command had been processed by units of the Eighth United States Army.

On 31 May 1945, the Bohol Area Command was officially deactivated upon orders of Lt. General Robert L. Eichelberger, Commanding General of the Eighth United States Army, together with the regular and constable troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary, and the Boholano guerrillas.

During the from March to August 1945, Filipino troops of the 3rd, 8th, 83rd, 85th and 86th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 8th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary captured and liberated the island province of Bohol and helped the Boholano guerrilla fighters and U.S. liberation forces defeat the Japanese Imperial forces under General Sōsaku Suzuki.

=== Postwar Era ===

After the death of President Ramon Magsaysay, Vice President Carlos P. Garcia, who had been born in Talibon, succeeded to the presidency. He won a full term in the 1957 presidential election. He ran for a second full term as president in the 1961 presidential election and was defeated by Vice President Diosdado Macapagal.

In 1965 after a number of attempts to convert Tagbilaran into a City, the three Congressmen of Bohol sponsored the Bill to which would become Republic ACt 4660, creating the City Charter of Tagbilaran on 18 June 1966.

=== Marcos dictatorship Era ===

The Philippines&#x27; gradual postwar recovery took a turn for the worse in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis being one of the early landmark events. Economic analysts generally attribute this to the ramp-up on loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign, although Marcos blamed the unrest on the 1968 formation of the Communist Party of the Philippines in an effort to earn political and military support from the zealously anticommunist Nixon and Ford administrations in the US. 

In Bohol, which had been marked by agricultural self-sufficiency and &quot;unusually egalitarian&quot; set of social norms for landholding patterns until then, these economic shocks were worsened by rapid population growth and declining rice yields. The introduction of intensive rice agriculture in the uplands led to large-scale deforestation, which then led to the loss of water for ricefields in the lowlands. Cases of land usurpation began rising, which then degraded the relationships between landowners and tenants. 

In 1972, one year before the expected end of his last constitutionally allowed term as president in 1973, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law. This allowed Marcos to remain in power for fourteen more years, during which Bohol went through many social and economic ups and downs. The economic difficulties, paired with crony capitalism, and personal expensive lifestyles of the Marcos Family resulted in disillusionment, and when protests were met with warranteless detentions and human rights abuses, many oppositionists who had previously held &quot;moderate&quot; positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms) became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change. The activities of the Marcos administration had &quot;mythologized&quot; the CPP&#x27;s New People Army (NPA), so many of the radicalized protesters reacted by joining the NPA. By 1981, NPA activities had begun to be noted in the upland areas of Sevilla, Bilar, Batuan and Balilihan.

During this time Camp Dagohoy in Tagbilaran functioned as one of many detention centers during the Marcos dictatorship, under the ambit of Regional Command for Detainees III (RECAD III) at Camp Lapu-Lapu in Cebu City. Among whose detainees of Camp Dagohoy was the 19-year old brother of Judge Meinrado Paredes, who was beaten with firearms so that he eventually suffered permanent damage to his hearing.

The immediate government response to the NPA presence was an integrated &quot;social, economic, cultural and political&quot; program which also saw the deployment of a &quot;Special Action Force&quot; to the island in 1985, but conflict continued and even intensified through the 1980s and 1990s. The government was only able to declare Bohol &quot;NPA free&quot; in the 2010s, after the success of an effort termed the &quot;Bohol Model&quot;, which saw military action play a secondary role while highlighting the civil government&#x27;s provision of services which addressed local poverty and other root causes of community discontent.

===Contemporary===
==== 2013 earthquake ====

At 8:12 a.m. (PST) on 15 October 2013, the island province suffered a severe earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 on the Richter scale. Its epicenter was at ( of Sagbayan and from Manila), and its depth of focus was . The quake was felt as far as Davao City, Mindanao. According to official reports by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), 57 people died in Bohol, and 104 were injured, The North Bohol Fault or &quot;Great Wall of Bohol&quot; is a reverse fault was discovered on 15, October 2013 during the 2013 Bohol earthquake. It became one of the tourist attractions in Bohol province 

It was the deadliest earthquake in the Philippines since the 7.8 magnitude 1990 Luzon earthquake. Earlier that same year, Bohol was struck by an earthquake (on February 8, 1990) with an epicentre almost exactly the same as in 2013, causing six fatalities and 200 injured. Several buildings were damaged and it caused a tsunami.

====2017 militant incursion====
On 12 April 2017, 11 Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) militants staged an attack on Bohol. Three soldiers, a police officer and at least four of the armed men, including their leader Abu Rami, were killed in the clashes that started at 5 am. Also killed were two Inabanga villagers, though it was not clear whether they were killed in the crossfire or executed by the cornered militants. Security officials hunted down the remainder of the ASG who landed in Bohol from the hinterlands to a neighboring island in the province which ultimately led to the neutralization of Abu Asis, the last of the remaining bandits, in May. He was gunned down by police Special Weapons and Tactics operatives in Barangay Lawis, Calape while fighting it out to the end along with Ubayda. All 11 ASG members killed in the intrusion were given proper burials under Muslim tradition.

The tourism industry in Bohol was negatively affected by the ASG militants&#x27; incursion on the island, though tour operators believe the industry can recover.

====2023 UNESCO recognition====
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 24 May 2023, added Bohol as one of the 18 new sites, and the Philippines country&#x27;s first, in its Global Geoparks network. The United Nations cites geoparks as “single, unified geographical areas” where sites and landscapes have international geological significance and to also be “managed with a holistic concept of protection, education, and sustainable development,” UNESCO said. Bohol as a UNESCO Global Geopark covers 8,808 square kilometers of land surrounding lush marine protected areas. It features wondrous, not-yet-popular karstic geosites like caves, sinkholes, among others. UNESCO cited Bohol Island&#x27;s “400 years of rich history and cultural traditions in harmony with its unique geological treasures.”

Some of the sites highlighted in UNESCO Global Geopark are the following: Danajon Bank Double Barrier Reef, Alicia Panoramic Park, Princess Manan-aw Cave, Can-umantad Falls, Loon Coastal Geomorphic Conservation Park, Maribojoc Uplifted Marine Terrace, Baclayon Marine Terraces, Hinagdanan Cave, Canawa Cold Spring, Cave pools of Anda, Lamanok Island and Batungay Cave.

==Geography==
To the west of Bohol is Cebu, to the northeast is the island of Leyte and to the south, across the Bohol Sea, is Mindanao. The Cebu Strait separates Bohol from Cebu, and both island provinces share a common language, but Boholano retains a conscious distinction from Cebuano. Bohol&#x27;s climate is generally dry, with maximum rainfall between the months of June and October. The interior is cooler than the coast.

===Physical features===
With a land area of and a coastline long, Bohol is the tenth largest island of the Philippines. The main island is surrounded by about 70 smaller islands, the largest of which are Panglao Island, facing Tagbilaran, in the southwest and Lapinig Island in the northeast.

The terrain of Bohol is basically rolling and hilly, and about half the island is covered in limestone. Near the outer areas of the island are low mountain ranges. The interior is a large plateau with irregular landforms.

Near Carmen, the Chocolate Hills are more than 1,200 uniformly cone-shaped hills named for the grass growing on the hills that turns brown in the summer, making the landscape look like chocolate mounds. They are hills made of limestone left over from coral reefs during the Ice Age when the island was submerged. The Chocolate Hills are considered one of Philippine&#x27;s natural wonders and Bohol is often referred to as the &quot;Jewel of the Philippines&quot;. They appear on the provincial seal of Bohol.

Bohol has 114 springs, 172 creeks, and four main rivers that run through Bohol with a radial drainage pattern. The largest river, the Inabanga, runs in the northwestern part of the province; the Loboc River drains the center of the island to the mid-southern coast; the Abatan River runs in the southwest, and Ipil River in the north. The only natural lake in the province is Cabilao Island Lake, also called Lake Danao or Lanao, on Cabilao Island.

Numerous waterfalls and caves are scattered across the island, including MagAso Falls in Antequera. MagAso means &quot;smoke&quot; in the native tongue. The water is cool and often creates a mist in humid mornings which can hide the falls.

The Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape protects Bohol&#x27;s largest remaining lowland forest and can be found in the island&#x27;s southern portion near Bilar.

===Tarsier===

In 1996 the Philippine Tarsier Foundation was established in Corella, Bohol in efforts to help conserve and protect tarsiers and their habitat. Forest and habitat sanctuaries have been created to ensure the safety of tarsiers while allowing visitors to roam and discover these miniature primates in their natural habitats.

The tarsier is the smallest living primate and exists in several Southeast Asian countries today. The Philippine tarsier, &quot;Tarsius syrichta&quot;, locally known as &quot;mamag&quot; in Boholano is near to threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Adaptation to their large bulging eyes allows them to catch prey clearly at night, and with elongated limbs and fingers, leaping from tree to tree gives no limitation to the tarsier. Their brain is about the same size as their eyes. The connection between its eyes and brain serves a unique function to these animals which is important for their stability and balance. Tarsiers have incredible hearing abilities. They can hear a frequency of up to 91 kHz (kilohertz) and send sounds of 70 kHz.

===Climate===

From November to April, the northeast monsoon (&quot;amihan&quot;) prevails. Except for a rare shower, this is the mildest time of the year. Daytime temperatures average , cooling at night to around . The summer season from May to July brings higher temperatures and very humid days. From August to October is the southwest monsoon (&quot;habagat&quot;). The weather during this season is not very predictable, with weeks of calm weather alternating with rainy days. It can rain any day of the year, but a higher chance of heavy showers occurs from November to January.

=== Geologic formation ===

The formation of the island of Bohol began during the Late Jurassic Period (about 160 to 145 million years ago). It was still submerged except for what is now Mt. Malibalibod in Ubay and its adjacent area in Alicia, Bohol. Approximately 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous Period, the northern portion of the island began to rise gradually. Volcanic activity during the time caused the deposition of numerous layers of volcanic rock in the region. Land mass increased and grew at the beginning of the Paleogene Period (about 60 million years ago). During this period, diorite, a form of igneous rock, was introduced into the Talibon area. Between the Eocene and Oligocene epochs, the island&#x27;s development was halted for millions of years. At the beginning of the Miocene epoch (about 23 million years ago), the island&#x27;s geologic evolution continued. The combination of uplift and volcanism resulted in the deposition of limestone and the expulsion of andesite, a form of volcanic rock. Only the eastern half of the island was above water during this time. Approximately 5 million years ago, the southeastern portion of the island began to emerge from the ocean. From the late Pliocene to the Pleistocene (approximately 3.6 to 1.8 million years ago), the rest of the once-submerged portion of the island of Bohol rose to the surface, giving the island its present form.

==Demographics==

According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 1,394,329.

Boholano people, a distinct ethnic subgroup of Cebuano, comprise the majority of Bohol with many residents in Southern Leyte and northern parts of Mindanao. Eskayans, a distinct ethnic group also native in Bohol, are residents of the forest hinterland interior of the southeastern municipalities of Duero, Guindulman, Pilar and Sierra Bullones. Residing sizeably in the province are the non-natives that include Cebuanos (from the northeast), Butuanons, Surigaonon (both from the Caraga in Mindanao) Hiligaynons, Ilocanos (from Panay, Negros Occidental and Ilocandia respectively, either directly or via Mindanao where they also both significantly reside), and Warays (from Eastern Visayas). 

===Languages===
Majority of Boholano residents speak Bohol Cebuano, a dialect of Cebuano native to the province. It also has speakers in Southern Leyte and in northern parts of Mindanao. Boholanos can also speak and understand standard Cebuano. Tagalog and English are mainly used for business, government affairs and in local academe. Eskayans has an artificial language of their own of the same name with its own alphabet. It is considered endangered language, leading to efforts to preserve the language by volunteers within the Eskayan community to teach it to younger fellow Eskayans. Butuanon, Surigaonon, Hiligaynon, Ilocano and Waray are also spoken varyingly in the province.

== Administrative divisions ==

There are 47 municipalities, 1 component city, and 1,109 barangays in Bohol.


==Economy==

Tourism plays an increasing role in the island&#x27;s economy. The Panglao Island International Airport is active since 2018 for domestic flights and international flights since 2023. The airport houses the most-visited and accessible beaches in the province. Proponents of the scheme hope that the new airport will increase Bohol&#x27;s reputation as an international tourist destination although the plan has been dogged by ongoing criticism.
Scuba Diving and Free Diving are among Bohol&#x27;s tourism industry driving forces. Panglao is the leader with more than 70 Panglao scuba diving centers and free-diving operators due to its numerous dive sites, including Pamilacan. The municipality of Dauis is a second runner in the province with many diving facilities directed to Pamilacan and Napaling. Anda and Cabilao also show some prominence in growing the diving industry in Bohol. Due to the rapid growth, private and public regulatory organizations are protecting the marine environment from manmade damages.

<doc id="244404" wikidata="Q104687" url="?curid=244404" title="Plebeians">
<text>In ancient Rome, the plebeians or plebs were the general body of free Roman citizens who were not patricians, as determined by the census, or in other words &quot;commoners&quot;. Both classes were hereditary.

==Etymology==
The precise origins of the group and the term are unclear, but may be related to the Greek, &quot;plēthos&quot;, meaning masses.

In Latin, the word is a singular collective noun, and its genitive is . Plebeians were not a monolithic social class.

==In ancient Rome==
In the annalistic tradition of Livy and Dionysius, the distinction between patricians and plebeians was as old as Rome itself, instituted by Romulus&#x27; appointment of the first hundred senators, whose descendants became the patriciate. Modern hypotheses date the distinction &quot;anywhere from the regal period to the late fifth century&quot; BC. The 19th-century historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr believed plebeians were possibly foreigners immigrating from other parts of Italy. This hypothesis, that plebeians were racially distinct from patricians, however, is not supported by the ancient evidence. Alternatively, the patriciate may have been defined by their monopolisation of hereditary priesthoods that granted &quot;ex officio&quot; membership in the senate. Patricians also may have emerged from a nucleus of the rich religious leaders who formed themselves into a closed elite after accomplishing the expulsion of the kings.

In the early Roman Republic, there are attested 43 clan names, of which 10 are plebeian with 17 of uncertain status. 

There existed an aristocracy of wealthy families in the regal period, but &quot;a clear-cut distinction of &quot;birth&quot; does not seem to have become important before the foundation of the Republic&quot;. The literary sources hold that in the early Republic, plebeians were excluded from magistracies, religious colleges, and the Senate. However, some scholars doubt that patricians monopolised the magistracies of the early republic, as plebeian names appear in the lists of Roman magistrates back to the fifth century BC. It is likely that patricians, over the course of the first half of the fifth century, were able to close off high political office from plebeians and exclude plebeians from permanent social integration through marriage.

Plebeians were enrolled into the &quot;curiae&quot; and the tribes; they also served in the army and also in army officer roles as &quot;tribuni militum&quot;.

===Conflict of the Orders===
The Conflict of the Orders ( meaning &quot;social rank&quot;) refers to a struggle by plebeians for full political rights from the patricians. According to Roman tradition, shortly after the establishment of the Republic, plebeians objected to their exclusion from power and exploitation by the patricians. The plebeians were able to achieve their political goals by a series of secessions from the city: &quot;a combination of mutiny and a strike&quot;.

Ancient Roman tradition claimed that the Conflict led to laws being published, written down, and given open access starting in 494 BC with the law of the Twelve Tables, which also introduced the concept of equality before the law, often referred to in Latin as &quot;libertas&quot;, which became foundational to republican politics. This succession also forced the creation of plebeian tribunes with authority to defend plebeian interests. Following this, there was a period of consular tribunes who shared power between plebeians and patricians in various years, but the consular tribunes apparently were not endowed with religious authority. In 445 BC, the &quot;lex Canuleia&quot; permitted intermarriage among plebeians and patricians.

There was a radical reform in 367–6 BC, which abolished consular tribunes and &quot;laid the foundation for a system of government led by two consuls, shared between patricians and plebeians&quot; over the religious objections of patricians, requiring at least one of the consuls to be a plebeian. And after 342 BC, plebeians regularly attained the consulship. Debt bondage was abolished in 326, freeing plebeians from the possibility of slavery by patrician creditors. By 287, with the passage of the &quot;lex Hortensia&quot;, plebiscites – or laws passed by the &quot;concilium plebis&quot; – were made binding on the whole Roman people. Moreover, it banned senatorial vetoes of plebeian council laws. And also around the year 300 BC, the priesthoods also were shared between patricians and plebeians, ending the &quot;last significant barrier to plebeian emancipation&quot;.

The veracity of the traditional story is profoundly unclear: &quot;many aspects of the story as it has come down to us must be wrong, heavily modernised... or still much more myth than history&quot;. Substantial portions of the rhetoric put into the mouths of the plebeian reformers of the early Republic are likely imaginative reconstructions reflecting the late republican politics of their writers. Contradicting claims that plebs were excluded from politics from the fall of the monarchy, plebeians appear in the consular lists during the early fifth century BC. The form of the state may also have been substantially different, with a temporary ad hoc &quot;senate&quot;, not taking on fully classical elements for more than a century from the republic&#x27;s establishment.

===Noble plebeians===
The completion of plebeian political emancipation was founded on a republican ideal dominated by &quot;nobiles&quot;, who were defined not by caste or heredity, but by their accession to the high offices of state, elected from both patrician and plebeian families. There was substantial convergence in this class of people, with a complex culture of preserving the memory of and celebrating one&#x27;s political accomplishments and those of one&#x27;s ancestors. This culture also focused considerably on achievements in terms of war and personal merit.

Throughout the Second Samnite War (326–304 BC), plebeians who had risen to power through these social reforms began to acquire the aura of &quot;&quot; (&quot;nobility&quot;, also &quot;fame, renown&quot;), marking the creation of a ruling elite of &quot;nobiles&quot;. From the mid-4th century to the early 3rd century BC, several plebeian–patrician &quot;tickets&quot; for the consulship repeated joint terms, suggesting a deliberate political strategy of cooperation.

No contemporary definition of &quot;nobilis&quot; or &quot;novus homo&quot; (a person entering the nobility) exists; Mommsen, positively referenced by Brunt (1982), said the &quot;nobiles&quot; were patricians, patrician whose families had become plebeian (in a conjectural &quot;transitio ad plebem&quot;), and plebeians who had held curule offices (e.g., dictator, consul, praetor, and curule aedile). Becoming a senator after election to a quaestorship did not make a man a &quot;nobilis&quot;, only those who were entitled to a curule seat were &quot;nobiles&quot;. However, by the time of Cicero in the post-Sullan Republic, the definition of &quot;nobilis&quot; had shifted. Now, &quot;nobilis&quot; came to refer only to former consuls and the direct relatives and male descendants thereof. The new focus on the consulship &quot;can be directly related to the many other displays of pedigree and family heritage that became increasingly common after Sulla&quot; and with the expanded senate and number of praetors diluting the honour of the lower offices.

A person becoming &quot;nobilis&quot; by election to the consulate was a &quot;novus homo&quot; (a new man). Marius and Cicero are notable examples of &quot;novi homines&quot; (new men) in the late Republic, when many of Rome&#x27;s richest and most powerful men – such as Lucullus, Marcus Crassus, and Pompey – were plebeian nobles.

===Later history===
In the later Republic, the term lost its indication of a social order or formal hereditary class, becoming used instead to refer to citizens of lower socio-economic status. By the early empire, the word was used to refer to people who were not senators (of the empire or of the local municipalities) or equestrians.

==Life==
Much less is known about the plebeians than the patricians in Ancient Rome, as most could not write, and thus could not record what happened in their daily life.

===Childhood and education===
The average plebeian did not come into a wealthy family; the politically active &quot;nobiles&quot; as a whole comprised a very small portion of the whole population. The average plebeian child was expected to enter the workforce at a young age. 

Education was limited to what their parent would teach them, which consisted of only learning the very basics of writing, reading and mathematics. Wealthier plebeians were able to send their children to schools or hire a private tutor.

=== Family life ===
Throughout Roman society at all levels including plebeians, the &quot;paterfamilias&quot; (oldest male in the family) held ultimate authority over household manners. Sons could have no authority over fathers at any point in their life. Women had a subservient position in the family to fathers and husbands.

===Living quarters===
Plebeians who lived in the cities were referred to as &quot;plebs urbana&quot;.

Plebeians in ancient Rome lived in three or four-storey buildings called , apartment buildings that housed many families. These apartments usually lacked running water and heat. These buildings had no bathrooms and was common for a pot to be used. The quality of these buildings varied. Accessing upper floors was done via a staircase from the street they were built on. Sometimes these were built around a courtyard and of these, some were built around a courtyard containing a cistern. Lower floors were of higher quality while the higher ones were less so. By the beginning of the Roman Empire, the &quot;insulaes&quot; were deemed to be so dangerous because of a risk to collapse that Emperor Augustus passed a law limiting the height of the buildings to but it appeared this law was not closely followed as buildings appeared that were six or seven floors high. Plebeian apartments had frescoes and mosaics on them to serve as decorations. Rents for housing in cities was often high because of the amount of demand and simultaneously low supply. Rents were higher in Rome than other cities in Italy along with other provincial cities. The owner of the insulae did not attend to duties regarding it and instead used an &quot;insularius&quot; who was most often an educated slave or a freedman instead. Their job was to collect rent from tenants, manage disputes between individual tenants and be responsible for maintenance.

Not all plebeians lived in these conditions, as some wealthier plebs were able to live in single-family homes, called a domus. Another type of housing that existed was diversorias (lodging houses) &quot;Tabernae&quot; which were made of timber frames and wicker walls open to streets with the exception of shutters being one to two floors high with tightly packed spaces.

===Attire===
Plebeian men wore a tunic, generally made of wool felt or inexpensive material, with a belt at the waist, as well as sandals. Meanwhile, women wore a long dress called a stola. Roman fashion trends changed very little over the course of many centuries. However, hairstyles and facial hair patterns changed as initially early plebeian men had beards before a clean shaven look became more popular during the Republican era before having facial hair was popularized again by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century CE. Some plebeian women would wear cosmetics made from charcoal and chalk. Romans generally wore clothes with bright colors and did wear a variety of jewelry.

===Meals===
Since meat was very expensive, animal products such as pork, beef and veal would have been considered a delicacy to plebeians. Instead, a plebeian diet mainly consisted of bread and vegetables. Common flavouring for their food included honey, vinegar and different herbs and spices. A well-known condiment to this day known as garum, which is a fish sauce, was also largely consumed. Apartments often did not have kitchens in them so families would get food from restaurants and/or bars.

=== Recreation and entertainment ===
One popular outlet of entertainment for Roman plebeians was to attend large entertainment events such as gladiator matches, military parades, religious festivals and chariot races. As time went on, politicians increased the number of games in an attempt to win over votes and make the plebeians happy. A popular dice game among plebeians was called &quot;alea&quot;.

===Financial status===
Plebeians who resided in urban areas had to often deal with job insecurity, low pay, unemployment and high prices along with underemployment. A standard workday lasted for 6 hours although the length of the hours varied as Romans divided the day into 12 daytime hours and 12 nighttime hours; with the hours being determined based on the seasons. Cicero wrote in the late republican period that he estimated the average laborer working in the city of Rome earned 6 1/2 &quot;denarii&quot; a day which was 5 times what a provincial worker would make. By middle of the 1st century CE this number was higher because of inflation but however the high cost of living in the city of Rome kept the value of real wages down.

Some plebeians would sell themselves into slavery or their children in order to have access to wealthy households and to them hopefully advance socially along with getting a chance to have an education. Another way plebeians would try to advance themselves was by joining the military which became easier after the Marian reforms as soldiers were expected to pay for their own weapons. By joining the military they could get a fixed salary, share of war loot along with a pension and an allotted land parcel. There was also the reward of getting citizenship for non-citizens. Potential recruits needed to meet a variety of requirements as well which included: being male, at least tall, enlist before one was 35, having a letter of recommendation and completing training.

==Derivatives==

===United States military academies===


In the U.S. military, plebes are freshmen at the U.S. Military Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, Valley Forge Military Academy and College, the Marine Military Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Georgia Military College (only for the first quarter), and California Maritime Academy. 

===Philippine Military Academy===
Since the construction of Philippine Military Academy, the system and traditions were programmed the same as the United States Military Academy. First Year Cadets in PMA are called Plebes or &quot;Plebos (short term for Fourth Class Cadets) because they are still civilian antiques and they are expected to master first the spirit of Followership. As plebes, they are also expected to become the &quot;working force (force men or &quot;porsmen&quot;&quot;) in the Corps of Cadets.

===British and Commonwealth usage===
In British, Irish, Australian, New Zealand and South African English, the back-formation &quot;pleb&quot;, along with the more recently derived adjectival form &quot;plebby&quot;, is used as a derogatory term for someone considered unsophisticated, uncultured, or lower class.

==In popular culture==
The British comedy show &quot;Plebs&quot; followed plebeians during ancient Rome.

In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s novel &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot;, there is a major class divide. The rich and educated live in safeguarded facilities while others live in dilapidated cities referred to as the &quot;pleeblands&quot;.

<doc id="244431" wikidata="Q174733" url="?curid=244431" title="Bipartite graph">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets formula_1 and formula_2, that is, every edge connects a vertex in formula_1 to one in formula_2. Vertex sets formula_1 and formula_2 are usually called the &quot;parts&quot; of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.

The two sets formula_1 and formula_2 may be thought of as a coloring of the graph with two colors: if one colors all nodes in formula_1 blue, and all nodes in formula_2 red, each edge has endpoints of differing colors, as is required in the graph coloring problem. In contrast, such a coloring is impossible in the case of a non-bipartite graph, such as a triangle: after one node is colored blue and another red, the third vertex of the triangle is connected to vertices of both colors, preventing it from being assigned either color.

One often writes formula_11 to denote a bipartite graph whose partition has the parts formula_1 and formula_2, with formula_14 denoting the edges of the graph. If a bipartite graph is not connected, it may have more than one bipartition; in this case, the formula_15 notation is helpful in specifying one particular bipartition that may be of importance in an application. If formula_16, that is, if the two subsets have equal cardinality, then formula_17 is called a &quot;balanced&quot; bipartite graph. If all vertices on the same side of the bipartition have the same degree, then formula_17 is called biregular.

==Examples==

When modelling relations between two different classes of objects, bipartite graphs very often arise naturally. For instance, a graph of football players and clubs, with an edge between a player and a club if the player has played for that club, is a natural example of an &quot;affiliation network&quot;, a type of bipartite graph used in social network analysis.

Another example where bipartite graphs appear naturally is in the (NP-complete) railway optimization problem, in which the input is a schedule of trains and their stops, and the goal is to find a set of train stations as small as possible such that every train visits at least one of the chosen stations. This problem can be modeled as a dominating set problem in a bipartite graph that has a vertex for each train and each station and an edge for each pair of a station and a train that stops at that station.

A third example is in the academic field of numismatics. Ancient coins are made using two positive impressions of the design (the obverse and reverse). The charts numismatists produce to represent the production of coins are bipartite graphs.

More abstract examples include the following:
* Every tree is bipartite.
* Cycle graphs with an even number of vertices are bipartite.
* Every planar graph whose faces all have even length is bipartite. Special cases of this are grid graphs and squaregraphs, in which every inner face consists of 4 edges and every inner vertex has four or more neighbors.
* The complete bipartite graph on &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; vertices, denoted by &quot;Kn,m&quot; is the bipartite graph formula_19, where &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are disjoint sets of size &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, respectively, and &quot;E&quot; connects every vertex in &quot;U&quot; with all vertices in &quot;V&quot;. It follows that &quot;Km,n&quot; has &quot;mn&quot; edges. Closely related to the complete bipartite graphs are the crown graphs, formed from complete bipartite graphs by removing the edges of a perfect matching.
* Hypercube graphs, partial cubes, and median graphs are bipartite. In these graphs, the vertices may be labeled by bitvectors, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of ones from the vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every median graph is a partial cube.

==Properties==

===Characterization===
Bipartite graphs may be characterized in several different ways:
* An undirected graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle.
* A graph is bipartite if and only if it is 2-colorable, (i.e. its chromatic number is less than or equal to 2).
* A graph is bipartite if and only if every edge belongs to an odd number of bonds, minimal subsets of edges whose removal increases the number of components of the graph. 
* A graph is bipartite if and only if the spectrum of the graph is symmetric.

===Kőnig&#x27;s theorem and perfect graphs===
In bipartite graphs, the size of minimum vertex cover is equal to the size of the maximum matching; this is Kőnig&#x27;s theorem. An alternative and equivalent form of this theorem is that the size of the maximum independent set plus the size of the maximum matching is equal to the number of vertices. In any graph without isolated vertices the size of the minimum edge cover plus the size of a maximum matching equals the number of vertices. Combining this equality with Kőnig&#x27;s theorem leads to the facts that, in bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum edge cover is equal to the size of the maximum independent set, and the size of the minimum edge cover plus the size of the minimum vertex cover is equal to the number of vertices.

Another class of related results concerns perfect graphs: every bipartite graph, the complement of every bipartite graph, the line graph of every bipartite graph, and the complement of the line graph of every bipartite graph, are all perfect. Perfection of bipartite graphs is easy to see (their chromatic number is two and their maximum clique size is also two) but perfection of the complements of bipartite graphs is less trivial, and is another restatement of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem. This was one of the results that motivated the initial definition of perfect graphs. Perfection of the complements of line graphs of perfect graphs is yet another restatement of Kőnig&#x27;s theorem, and perfection of the line graphs themselves is a restatement of an earlier theorem of Kőnig, that every bipartite graph has an edge coloring using a number of colors equal to its maximum degree.

According to the strong perfect graph theorem, the perfect graphs have a forbidden graph characterization resembling that of bipartite graphs: a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycle as a subgraph, and a graph is perfect if and only if it has no odd cycle or its complement as an induced subgraph. The bipartite graphs, line graphs of bipartite graphs, and their complements form four out of the five basic classes of perfect graphs used in the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem. It follows that any subgraph of a bipartite graph is also bipartite because it cannot gain an odd cycle.

For a vertex, the number of adjacent vertices is called the degree of the vertex and is denoted formula_20. The degree sum formula for a bipartite graph states that
:formula_21

The degree sequence of a bipartite graph is the pair of lists each containing the degrees of the two parts formula_1 and formula_2. For example, the complete bipartite graph &quot;K&quot;3,5 has degree sequence formula_24. Isomorphic bipartite graphs have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a bipartite graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic bipartite graphs may have the same degree sequence.

The bipartite realization problem is the problem of finding a simple bipartite graph with the degree sequence being two given lists of natural numbers. (Trailing zeros may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the digraph.)

===Relation to hypergraphs and directed graphs===
The biadjacency matrix of a bipartite graph formula_15 is a (0,1) matrix of size formula_26 that has a one for each pair of adjacent vertices and a zero for nonadjacent vertices. Biadjacency matrices may be used to describe equivalences between bipartite graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs.

A hypergraph is a combinatorial structure that, like an undirected graph, has vertices and edges, but in which the edges may be arbitrary sets of vertices rather than having to have exactly two endpoints. A bipartite graph formula_15 may be used to model a hypergraph in which is the set of vertices of the hypergraph, is the set of hyperedges, and contains an edge from a hypergraph vertex to a hypergraph edge exactly when is one of the endpoints of . Under this correspondence, the biadjacency matrices of bipartite graphs are exactly the incidence matrices of the corresponding hypergraphs. As a special case of this correspondence between bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, any multigraph (a graph in which there may be two or more edges between the same two vertices) may be interpreted as a hypergraph in which some hyperedges have equal sets of endpoints, and represented by a bipartite graph that does not have multiple adjacencies and in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition all have degree two.

A similar reinterpretation of adjacency matrices may be used to show a one-to-one correspondence between directed graphs (on a given number of labeled vertices, allowing self-loops) and balanced bipartite graphs, with the same number of vertices on both sides of the bipartition. For, the adjacency matrix of a directed graph with vertices can be any (0,1) matrix of size formula_28, which can then be reinterpreted as the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph with vertices on each side of its bipartition. In this construction, the bipartite graph is the bipartite double cover of the directed graph.

==Algorithms==

===Testing bipartiteness===
It is possible to test whether a graph is bipartite, and to return either a two-coloring (if it is bipartite) or an odd cycle (if it is not) in linear time, using depth-first search. The main idea is to assign to each vertex the color that differs from the color of its parent in the depth-first search forest, assigning colors in a preorder traversal of the depth-first-search forest. This will necessarily provide a two-coloring of the spanning forest consisting of the edges connecting vertices to their parents, but it may not properly color some of the non-forest edges. In a depth-first search forest, one of the two endpoints of every non-forest edge is an ancestor of the other endpoint, and when the depth first search discovers an edge of this type it should check that these two vertices have different colors. If they do not, then the path in the forest from ancestor to descendant, together with the miscolored edge, form an odd cycle, which is returned from the algorithm together with the result that the graph is not bipartite. However, if the algorithm terminates without detecting an odd cycle of this type, then every edge must be properly colored, and the algorithm returns the coloring together with the result that the graph is bipartite.

Alternatively, a similar procedure may be used with breadth-first search in place of depth-first search. Again, each node is given the opposite color to its parent in the search forest, in breadth-first order. If, when a vertex is colored, there exists an edge connecting it to a previously-colored vertex with the same color, then this edge together with the paths in the breadth-first search forest connecting its two endpoints to their lowest common ancestor forms an odd cycle. If the algorithm terminates without finding an odd cycle in this way, then it must have found a proper coloring, and can safely conclude that the graph is bipartite.

For the intersection graphs of formula_29 line segments or other simple shapes in the Euclidean plane, it is possible to test whether the graph is bipartite and return either a two-coloring or an odd cycle in time formula_30, even though the graph itself may have up to formula_31 edges.

===Odd cycle transversal===
Odd cycle transversal is an NP-complete algorithmic problem that asks, given a graph &quot;G&quot; = (&quot;V&quot;,&quot;E&quot;) and a number &quot;k&quot;, whether there exists a set of &quot;k&quot; vertices whose removal from &quot;G&quot; would cause the resulting graph to be bipartite. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning that there is an algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the graph multiplied by a larger function of &quot;k&quot;. The name &quot;odd cycle transversal&quot; comes from the fact that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles. Hence, to delete vertices from a graph in order to obtain a bipartite graph, one needs to &quot;hit all odd cycle&quot;, or find a so-called odd cycle transversal set. In the illustration, every odd cycle in the graph contains the blue (the bottommost) vertices, so removing those vertices kills all odd cycles and leaves a bipartite graph.

The &quot;edge bipartization&quot; problem is the algorithmic problem of deleting as few edges as possible to make a graph bipartite and is also an important problem in graph modification algorithmics. This problem is also fixed-parameter tractable, and can be solved in time formula_32, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of edges to delete and &quot;m&quot; is the number of edges in the input graph.

===Matching===

A matching in a graph is a subset of its edges, no two of which share an endpoint. Polynomial time algorithms are known for many algorithmic problems on matchings, including maximum matching (finding a matching that uses as many edges as possible), maximum weight matching, and stable marriage. In many cases, matching problems are simpler to solve on bipartite graphs than on non-bipartite graphs, and many matching algorithms such as the Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for maximum cardinality matching work correctly only on bipartite inputs.

As a simple example, suppose that a set formula_33 of people are all seeking jobs from among a set formula_34 of jobs, with not all people suitable for all jobs. This situation can be modeled as a bipartite graph formula_35 where an edge connects each job-seeker with each suitable job. A perfect matching describes a way of simultaneously satisfying all job-seekers and filling all jobs; Hall&#x27;s marriage theorem provides a characterization of the bipartite graphs which allow perfect matchings. The National Resident Matching Program applies graph matching methods to solve this problem for U.S. medical student job-seekers and hospital residency jobs.

The Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition is a structural decomposition of bipartite graphs that is useful in finding maximum matchings.

==Additional applications==
Bipartite graphs are extensively used in modern coding theory, especially to decode codewords received from the channel. Factor graphs and Tanner graphs are examples of this. A Tanner graph is a bipartite graph in which the vertices on one side of the bipartition represent digits of a codeword, and the vertices on the other side represent combinations of digits that are expected to sum to zero in a codeword without errors. A factor graph is a closely related belief network used for probabilistic decoding of LDPC and turbo codes.

In computer science, a Petri net is a mathematical modeling tool used in analysis and simulations of concurrent systems. A system is modeled as a bipartite directed graph with two sets of nodes: A set of &quot;place&quot; nodes that contain resources, and a set of &quot;event&quot; nodes which generate and/or consume resources. There are additional constraints on the nodes and edges that constrain the behavior of the system. Petri nets utilize the properties of bipartite directed graphs and other properties to allow mathematical proofs of the behavior of systems while also allowing easy implementation of simulations of the system.

In projective geometry, Levi graphs are a form of bipartite graph used to model the incidences between points and lines in a configuration. Corresponding to the geometric property of points and lines that every two lines meet in at most one point and every two points be connected with a single line, Levi graphs necessarily do not contain any cycles of length four, so their girth must be six or more.

== Biography ==
Parker was born in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was a construction equipment salesman. He is an honors graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, with a major in history and a minor in art history. He continued his education at University of Maryland School of Law at the urban campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, graduating in 1973 with a Juris Doctor degree. He discovered wine as a student visiting Alsace, where Patricia, now his wife, was studying. For over ten years, he was assistant general counsel for the Farm Credit Banks of Baltimore; he resigned in March 1984 to focus on writing about wine.

In 1975, Parker began writing a wine guidebook. Taking his cue from consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Parker wanted to write about wine without the conflicts of interest that might taint the opinions of other critics who also make a living &quot;selling&quot; wine. In 1978, he published a direct-mail newsletter called &quot;The Baltimore-Washington Wine Advocate&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;The Wine Advocate.&quot; The first issue was sent free to consumers from mailing lists Parker purchased from several major wine retailers. Six hundred charter subscribers paid to receive the second issue published later that year.

Parker received worldwide attention when he called the 1982 vintage in Bordeaux superb, contrary to the opinions of many other critics, such as San Francisco critic Robert Finigan, who felt it was too low-acid and ripe. While there is still debate about the timelessness of the vintage, prices of 1982 Bordeaux remain consistently higher than other vintages.

More than twenty years later, &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; has over 50,000 subscribers, primarily in the United States, but with significant readership in over 37 other countries. While other wine publications have more subscribers, &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; is still considered to exert a significant influence on wine consumers&#x27; buying habits, particularly in America. &quot;New York Times&quot; wine critic Frank Prial asserted that &quot;Robert M. Parker Jr. is the most influential wine critic in the world.&quot;

A lengthy profile of Parker entitled &quot;The Million Dollar Nose&quot; ran in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in December 2000. Among other claims, Parker told the author that he tastes 10,000 wines a year and &quot;remembers every wine he has tasted over the past thirty-two years and, within a few points, every score he has given as well.&quot; Yet, in a public blind tasting of fifteen top wines from Bordeaux 2005—which he has called &quot;the greatest vintage of my lifetime&quot;—Parker could not correctly identify any of the wines, confusing left bank wines for right several times. (In general, &quot;left bank&quot; wines are grown in regions west of the Gironde Estuary, and &quot;right bank&quot; in the regions east.)

In addition to writing and tasting for &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;, which is published six times a year in Monkton, Maryland, Parker has been a contributing editor for &quot;Food and Wine Magazine&quot; and &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;. He has also written periodically for the British magazine &quot;The Field&quot; and has been the wine critic for France&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot; magazine, the first time a non-Frenchman has held this position.

Among the books and films that have focused on the influence and effects of Parker on the global wine industry are the 2004 book &quot;The Accidental Connoisseur&quot;, by Lawrence Osborne, the 2004 documentary film &quot;Mondovino&quot; by Jonathan Nossiter, a 2005 unauthorized biography &quot;The Emperor of Wine&quot; by Elin McCoy, the 2008 book &quot;The Battle for Wine and Love: Or How I Saved the World from Parkerization&quot; by Alice Feiring, and the 2010 French language &quot;bande dessinée&quot; comic book, &quot;Robert Parker: Les Sept Pêchés capiteux&quot;.

Parker&#x27;s nose and palate are insured for $1 million.

Parker disclosed at the end of 2012 that he would sell a &quot;substantial interest&quot; in his newsletter and step down as editor in chief. His new partners were a trio of Singapore-based hedge fund investors. Parker formally retired from &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; at the age of 71 in 2019.

== Impact on the world of wine ==

=== A new role for the wine critic ===
Until the 1970s, wine criticism was usually complementary to the production or trade of wine. The conflict of interest that might ensue from this close relationship was accepted by consumers, as they consulted wine reviews to gain an introduction to the world of wine, and not necessarily for advice on getting good value for their money. Hence, before Robert Parker, wine critics almost always had some link to the production or trade of wines.

Two wine critics were particularly influential in inspiring and defining Robert Parker:
* Robert Lawrence Balzer&#x27;s charisma inspired Parker. Like his contemporaries, Balzer rarely wrote negative statements about wines. He even once published a book under his name that had actually been written by wine grower Paul Masson.
* Robert Finigan was Parker&#x27;s forerunner in consumer-oriented wine reviewing. In the monthly &quot;Robert Finigan&#x27;s Private Guide to Wine&quot;, launched in 1972, Finigan offered consumer-oriented, independent wine criticism, just as Parker did after him. Finigan helped consumers make decisions by developing standard evaluation criteria; his qualitative comments were straightforward and understandable, and each wine was ranked on a quality scale (exceptional, above average, average, below average).

Parker is a consumer advocate who admires Ralph Nader and has been critical of most wine critics, who traditionally have been part of the wine industry and have had vested interests.

According to Mike Steinberger, Parker has inadvertently made becoming a wine critic in the future almost impossible, since— in part because of the success of his scoring system—it is now prohibitively expensive to taste the very wines one should criticize. If it behooves a critic to understand, say, Château Lafite 1982, 2000, 2003, and 2005 before assessing the latest vintage: the critic must drink wine worth tens of thousands of dollars before beginning the review.

=== 100-point rating system ===
One of the most influential and controversial features of Parker&#x27;s wine criticism is his 100-point rating system, which he popularized in conjunction with his friend Victor Morgenroth. Parker designed the system to counter what he believed to be confusing or inflated ratings by other wine writers—many of whom he accused of a conflict of interest, as they often had a financial interest in the wines they rated. The scale, now widely imitated in other publications (such as &quot;Wine Spectator&quot;), ranks wine on a scale from 50 to 100 points based upon the wine&#x27;s color and appearance, aroma and bouquet, flavor and finish, and overall quality level or potential. Therefore, 51 rather than 100 different ratings are possible. Although some critics, such as Jancis Robinson, argue that numerical rating systems are questionable—given the subjectivity of wine tasting and the variance in scores that a wine&#x27;s age and the circumstances of tasting can cause—similar 100-point scoring systems are widely used by American reviewers. Many British reviewers, such as Jancis Robinson and Clive Coates, still prefer a 20-point system.

Retailers in North America often mark wines with Parker&#x27;s point scores, using printed cards attached to the shelves. Parker cautions buyers that they should read the tasting notes to determine whether or not the wine is made in a style they will like; he states on his website:

Parker argues that he scores wines on how much pleasure they give him. He, and others, have said that it is the obscurity, corruption, and other problems of the appellation system that made his consumer-oriented approach necessary. For example, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 was based entirely upon the château&#x27;s reputation and trading price in 1855. However, since then many châteaux have sold much of their vineyards; others have bought additional vineyards far away. The original winemakers are long dead. Parker says that this state of affairs was responsible for creating an injustice for consumers, causing mediocre wine to be sold at too high a price, and good wine to be sold at too low a price. He says of the 1855 classifications, &quot;At most, these classifications should be regarded by both the wine connoisseur and novice as informational items of historical significance only.&quot;

Parker has admitted that emotions do matter, contrary to the seeming objectivity of the 100-point scale: &quot;I really think probably the only difference between a 96-, 97-, 98-, 99-, and 100-point wine is really the emotion of the moment.&quot;

Parker is considered an unusually fast taster, and during an initial assessment he may keep a wine in his mouth for only four or five seconds before determining whether it is potentially a wine of 80 points or above. Mediocre wines will then be dismissed while those with potential are tasted twice or three times in succession before the final score is determined.

=== Impact on the supply: the &quot;Parkerization&quot; of wine ===
Parker&#x27;s impact on the style of fine wines has generated controversy. Parker is highly critical of &quot;those who make &#x27;industrial wines with little flavor and no authenticity and he believes that there are still undiscovered regions and wines that can successfully challenge the wine establishment. Critics such as Golo Weber claim that Parker likes less-acidic, riper wines with significant amounts of oak, alcohol, and extract. This supposed &quot;Parker taste&quot; may be less the result of Parker&#x27;s own preferences than of a trend initiated by Émile Peynaud, the French oenologist and father of the so-called &quot;international wines&quot;. In the 1970s, winemakers avoided the late harvests, when the grapes were mature, in order to avoid the risks of end-of-season rains. Peynaud proposed that winemakers should wait to harvest until the grape was fully mature, or even over-mature. He also insisted on control of malolactic fermentation through the use of stainless steel vessels.

The globalist domination of the oenological press by Parker&#x27;s ideas has led to changes in viticulture and winemaking practices, such as reducing yield by green harvesting, harvesting grapes as late as possible for maximum ripeness, not filtering the wine, and using new techniques—such as microoxygenation—to soften tannins. These widespread changes in technique have been called &quot;Parkerization&quot;, also sometimes known as &quot;The International Style&quot;, and have led to fear of a homogenization of wine styles around the world as Parker&#x27;s &quot;tastes are irrevocably changing the way some French wines are made&quot;, according to the BBC&#x27;s Caroline Wyatt. Indeed, certain low-producing &quot;boutique&quot; wineries, among others, have received high scores from Parker for wines made in this style. Parker disputes the notion of growing homogeneity and argues for the opposite: &quot;When I started tasting wines, in the 1970s, we were on a slippery slope. There was a standardization of wines, where you couldn&#x27;t tell a Chianti from a cabernet. That&#x27;s pretty much stopped now.&quot;

Jacques Hebrard, the manager of Château Cheval Blanc, was once outraged at Parker&#x27;s evaluation and asked Parker to re-taste the wine. Upon his return, Hebrard&#x27;s dog attacked Parker as the manager stood by idly and watched. Parker says that when he asked for a bandage to stop the bleeding from his leg, Hebrard instead gave him a copy of the offending newsletter. Hebrard denies that Parker was bleeding.
Wine critic Prial says &quot;The Bordeaux wine establishment feels threatened by these new-style wines... and is engaged in an increasingly bitter fight against Parker and his influence.&quot;

=== Impact on the market ===

==== Impact on prices ====
There is evidence that Parker&#x27;s rating scale has a dual effect on prices and sales, with claims from the wine industry that a Parker top score is valued at potentially £5 million.
* When Parker declined to review the 2002 Bordeaux vintage &quot;in barrel,&quot; the vintners were forced to drop their prices.
* According to one Bordeaux shipper cited by McCoy, &quot;the difference between a score of 85 and 95 [for one wine] was 6 to 7 million Euro&quot;, and a &quot;bottle rated 100 can multiply its price fourfold.&quot;
* Château Quinault, which used to have hard time selling its wine at 100 francs a bottle, saw its 1998 vintage rise in price in half a day to 125 francs after Parker gave it a 92 rating.
* According to a 2005 economic analysis, Parker&#x27;s scores would inflate the prices of already highly rated wines but, for the less good ones, it would not decrease their sales nor even increase their prices.
Whatever his influence, Parker alone cannot impact the market price for a wine if he is alone against the mainstream. The famous controversy around the Château Pavie 2003 is an example of this: despite Parker&#x27;s positive ratings, the wine in bottle sold 30% cheaper than &quot;en primeur&quot;.

In a statistical analysis published in &quot;New Political Economy&quot;, political scientist Colin Hay suggests that Parker has a significant impact on the price of &quot;en primeur&quot; Bordeaux wines:

Hay also argues that

Hay notes that Parker&#x27;s influence on consumer preferences is not so great as it is on prices.

==== Creation of new market segments ====
Parker strongly influenced the creation of &quot;garagiste&quot; wines, created by a group of innovative winemakers in the Bordeaux region of France.

== Limits to influences ==
Parker is an avid fan of Bordeaux, and some of his critics observe that his focus is largely limited to French wine. In recent years, he has taken on additional staff for &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;, which has enabled the publication to expand into other areas, such as Greek and Israeli wines. Still, his influence is most keenly felt by Bordeaux, California, and Rhône wines.

Parker&#x27;s influence on Burgundy wines was lessened as the result of a libel lawsuit filed against him by Domaine Faiveley. In the third edition of his &quot;Wine Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Parker reported that &quot;the Faiveley wines tasted abroad would be less rich than those one can taste on the spot [...]&quot;. In other words, Parker accused Faiveley of cheating. Faiveley sued Parker for libel; in February 1994, Parker was requested to appear in front of the Paris superior court (&quot;tribunal de grande instance&quot;). The case was settled out of court. It was eventually discovered that the difference in taste that Parker identified was due to improper storage of the wine at the American importer&#x27;s warehouse, causing the wine to be &quot;cooked.&quot; Parker delegated coverage of the Burgundy and Alsace regions to Pierre-Antoine Rovani in April 1997.

=== Controversy ===
Parker has stated very clearly, both in &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; and his books, that his advice stands on high ethical standards, and that independence and impartiality constitute his two most important values. By abiding by these standards, he says, he seeks to guarantee that his valuations will be pro-consumer, and not pro-industry.

Several published sources offer accounts that may call Parker&#x27;s independence and impartiality into question.

In her book &quot;Emperor of Wine&quot;, Elin McCoy describes a positive article Parker wrote in the second issue of &quot;The Baltimore/Washington Wine Advocate&quot; about MacArthur Liquors and its manager, Addy Bassin. That article fails to mention that Mr. Bassin sold Parker a list of MacArthur&#x27;s customers for use in mailing out the first, free issue of the &quot;Advocate&quot;, a potential conflict of interest.

In issue 164 of &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;, Parker wrote a long article about Jeffrey Davies, a wine trader based in Bordeaux. As Hanna Agostini and Marie-Françoise Guichard point out in their book &quot;Robert Parker, Anatomy of a Myth&quot;, what Parker failed to mention was that he tasted wines Davies, not by himself—yet Parker has repeatedly stated that an impartial wine critic should taste wines alone. Davies advised Parker not to publish his comments on the 2004 Bordeaux in issue 164, as Parker had planned, because they would have suffered from their comparison with the much better 2003 and 2005. Parker followed Davies&#x27; advice, and published those comments in the following issue instead.

The second issue of &quot;The Baltimore/Washington Wine Advocate&quot; stated &quot;Robert Parker has no interest, direct or indirect, financial or any other, in importing, distributing or selling wines.&quot; In the late 1980s, Parker invested in an Oregon vineyard with his brother-in-law, Michael G. Etzel, called The Beaux Frères Vineyard (&quot;The Brothers-in-Law&quot;), which would soon after become a commercial winery under the same name. He promised never to review any wines produced there in &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;.

Two of Parker&#x27;s tasters had, or still have, an interest in the distribution or the sale of wines, according to published accounts.
* Until January 1, 2007, David Schildknecht spent half of his time importing and distributing wines, and the other half critiquing wine for &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;. He subsequently became a full-time critic for &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot;.
* Kevin Zraly is the vice-president of Smith and Wollensky Restaurants, a group of 17 restaurants with a substantial wine list.

Robert Parker&#x27;s goddaughter, Marie Raynaud, is the daughter of Alain Raynaud—the co-owner of &quot;Château la Croix-de-Gay&quot; in Pomerol and former owner of &quot;Château Quinault&quot; in Saint-Émilion. Mr. Raynaud was the President of the &quot;Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux&quot;, an advocacy group for the Grand Crus of Bordeaux, between 1994 and 2000.

Yale University professor, econometrician, and lawyer Ian Ayres wrote about Robert Parker&#x27;s conflict with Orley Ashenfelter, the publisher of &quot;Liquid Assets: The International Guide to Fine Wines&quot;, in his book &quot;Super Crunchers&quot;. Ashenfelter devised a formula for predicting wine quality based on weather data such as rainfall and temperature that Parker characterized as &quot;ludicrous and absurd.&quot; Ashenfelter was able to show that Parker&#x27;s initial ratings of vintages had been biased upward, requiring him to revise his rankings downward more often than not. Says Ayres, &quot;Both the wine dealers and writers have a vested interest in maintaining their informational monopoly on the quality of wine.&quot; Ayres pointed out that Ashenfelter&#x27;s predictions have proven to be remarkably accurate, and claimed the wine critics&#x27; &quot;predictions now correspond much more closely to [Ashenfelter&#x27;s] simple equation results.&quot;

The famous English wine writer Hugh Johnson, in his autobiography &quot;Wine: A Life Uncorked&quot;, noted the influence of Robert Parker, though not uncritically.

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at adjacent vertices can be completed by adding one more edge to form a Hamiltonian cycle, and removing any edge from a Hamiltonian cycle produces a Hamiltonian path. The computational problems of determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs are NP-complete; see Hamiltonian path problem for details.

Hamiltonian paths and cycles are named after William Rowan Hamilton, who invented the icosian game, now also known as &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s puzzle&quot;, which involves finding a Hamiltonian cycle in the edge graph of the dodecahedron. Hamilton solved this problem using the icosian calculus, an algebraic structure based on roots of unity with many similarities to the quaternions (also invented by Hamilton). This solution does not generalize to arbitrary graphs.

Despite being named after Hamilton, Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra had also been studied a year earlier by Thomas Kirkman, who, in particular, gave an example of a polyhedron without Hamiltonian cycles. Even earlier, Hamiltonian cycles and paths in the knight&#x27;s graph of the chessboard, the knight&#x27;s tour, had been studied in the 9th century in Indian mathematics by Rudrata, and around the same time in Islamic mathematics by al-Adli ar-Rumi. In 18th century Europe, knight&#x27;s tours were published by Abraham de Moivre and Leonhard Euler.

==Definitions==
A &quot;Hamiltonian path&quot; or &quot;traceable path&quot; is a path that visits each vertex of the graph exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A graph is Hamiltonian-connected if for every pair of vertices there is a Hamiltonian path between the two vertices.

A &quot;Hamiltonian cycle&quot;, &quot;Hamiltonian circuit&quot;, &quot;vertex tour&quot; or &quot;graph cycle&quot; is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph.

Similar notions may be defined for &quot;directed graphs&quot;, where each edge (arc) of a path or cycle can only be traced in a single direction (i.e., the vertices are connected with arrows and the edges traced &quot;tail-to-head&quot;).

A Hamiltonian decomposition is an edge decomposition of a graph into Hamiltonian circuits.

A &quot;Hamilton maze&quot; is a type of logic puzzle in which the goal is to find the unique Hamiltonian cycle in a given graph.

==Examples==

* A complete graph with more than two vertices is Hamiltonian
* Every cycle graph is Hamiltonian
* Every tournament has an odd number of Hamiltonian paths (Rédei 1934)
* Every platonic solid, considered as a graph, is Hamiltonian
* The Cayley graph of a finite Coxeter group is Hamiltonian (For more information on Hamiltonian paths in Cayley graphs, see the Lovász conjecture.)
* Cayley graphs on nilpotent groups with cyclic commutator subgroup are Hamiltonian.
* The flip graph of a convex polygon or equivalently, the rotation graph of binary trees, is Hamiltonian.

==Properties==

Any Hamiltonian cycle can be converted to a Hamiltonian path by removing one of its edges, but a Hamiltonian path can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle only if its endpoints are adjacent.

All Hamiltonian graphs are biconnected, but a biconnected graph need not be Hamiltonian (see, for example, the Petersen graph).

An Eulerian graph (a connected graph in which every vertex has even degree) necessarily has an Euler tour, a closed walk passing through each edge of exactly once. This tour corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in the line graph , so the line graph of every Eulerian graph is Hamiltonian. Line graphs may have other Hamiltonian cycles that do not correspond to Euler tours, and in particular the line graph of every Hamiltonian graph is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether the graph is Eulerian.

A tournament (with more than two vertices) is Hamiltonian if and only if it is strongly connected.

The number of different Hamiltonian cycles in a complete undirected graph on vertices is and in a complete directed graph on vertices is . These counts assume that cycles that are the same apart from their starting point are not counted separately.

== Bondy–Chvátal theorem ==

The best vertex degree characterization of Hamiltonian graphs was provided in 1972 by the Bondy–Chvátal theorem, which generalizes earlier results by G. A. Dirac (1952) and Øystein Ore. Both Dirac&#x27;s and Ore&#x27;s theorems can also be derived from Pósa&#x27;s theorem (1962). Hamiltonicity has been widely studied with relation to various parameters such as graph density, toughness, forbidden subgraphs and distance among other parameters. Dirac and Ore&#x27;s theorems basically state that a graph is Hamiltonian if it has &quot;enough edges&quot;.

The Bondy–Chvátal theorem operates on the closure of a graph with vertices, obtained by repeatedly adding a new edge connecting a nonadjacent pair of vertices and with until no more pairs with this property can be found.

As complete graphs are Hamiltonian, all graphs whose closure is complete are Hamiltonian, which is the content of the following earlier theorems by Dirac and Ore.

The following theorems can be regarded as directed versions:

The number of vertices must be doubled because each undirected edge corresponds to two directed arcs and thus the degree of a vertex in the directed graph is twice the degree in the undirected graph.

The above theorem can only recognize the existence of a Hamiltonian path in a graph and not a Hamiltonian Cycle.

Many of these results have analogues for balanced bipartite graphs, in which the vertex degrees are compared to the number of vertices on a single side of the bipartition rather than the number of vertices in the whole graph.

== Existence of Hamiltonian cycles in planar graphs ==


== The Hamiltonian cycle polynomial ==

An algebraic representation of the Hamiltonian cycles of a given weighted digraph (whose arcs are assigned weights from a certain ground field) is the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial of its weighted adjacency matrix defined as the sum of the products of the arc weights of the digraph&#x27;s Hamiltonian cycles. This polynomial is not identically zero as a function in the arc weights if and only if the digraph is Hamiltonian. The relationship between the computational complexities of computing it and computing the permanent was shown by Grigoriy Kogan.

<text>Turnstones are two bird species that constitute the genus Arenaria in the family Scolopacidae. They are closely related to calidrid sandpipers and might be considered members of the tribe Calidriini.

The genus &quot;Arenaria&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the ruddy turnstone (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;) as the type species. The genus name &quot;arenaria&quot; is from Latin &quot;arenarius&quot;, &quot;inhabiting sand&quot;, from &quot;arena&quot;, &quot;sand&quot;.

The genus contains two species: the ruddy turnstone (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;) and the black turnstone (&quot;Arenaria melanocephala&quot;). Both birds are waders. Their length is typically between 20 and 25 cm, with a wingspan between 50 and 60 cm and a body mass between 110 and 130g. For waders their build is stocky, with short, slightly upturned, wedge shaped bills. They have white patches on the back, wings and tail. They are high Arctic breeders, and are migratory. Their strong necks and powerful, slightly upturned bills are adapted to their feeding technique. As the name implies, these species overturn stones, seaweed, and similar items in search of invertebrate prey. They are strictly coastal, prefer stony beaches to sand, and often share beach space with other species of waders such as purple sandpipers.

==Species==



There exists a fossil bone, a distal piece of tarsometatarsus found in the Edson Beds of Sherman County, Kansas. Dating from the mid-Blancan some 4-3 million years ago, it appears to be from a calidriid somewhat similar to a pectoral sandpiper, but has some traits reminiscent of turnstones. Depending on which traits are apomorphic and plesiomorphic, it may be an ancestral representative of either lineage.

<text>The ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres) is a small cosmopolitan wading bird, one of two species of turnstone in the genus &quot;Arenaria&quot;.

It is now classified in the sandpiper family Scolopacidae but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family Charadriidae. It is a highly migratory bird, breeding in northern parts of Eurasia and North America and flying south to winter on coastlines almost worldwide. It is the only species of turnstone in much of its range and is often known simply as turnstone.

==Taxonomy==
The ruddy turnstone was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Tringa interpres&quot;. The species is now placed together with the black turnstone in the genus &quot;Arenaria&quot; that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the ruddy turnstone as the type species. The genus name &quot;arenaria&quot; is from Latin &quot;arenarius&quot;, &quot;inhabiting sand&quot;, from &quot;arena&quot;, &quot;sand&quot;. The specific &quot;interpres&quot; means &quot;messenger&quot;; when visiting Gotland in 1741, Linnaeus thought that the Swedish word &quot;Tolk&quot;, meaning &quot;interpreter&quot; applied to this species, but in the local dialect the word means &quot;legs&quot; and is used for the redshank.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. i. interpres&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – breeds in northeast Canada, Greenland, north Europe to northeast Siberia and west Alaska; winters in west, south Europe, Africa, south, east Asia, Australasia, Pacific islands, west USA and west Mexico
* &quot;A. i. morinella&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – breeds in northeast Alaska and north Canada; winters in south USA to South America

==Description==
It is a fairly small and stocky bird, long with a wingspan of and a weight of . The dark, wedge-shaped bill is long and slightly upturned. The legs are fairly short at and are bright orange.

In all seasons, the plumage is dominated by a harlequin-like pattern of black and white. Breeding birds have reddish-brown upper parts with black markings. The head is mainly white with black streaks on the crown and a black pattern on the face. The breast is mainly black apart from a white patch on the sides. The rest of the underparts are white. In flight it reveals a white wingbar, white patch near the base of the wing and white lower back, rump and tail with dark bands on the uppertail-coverts and near the tip of the tail. The female is slightly duller than the male and has a browner head with more streaking.

Non-breeding adults are duller than breeding birds and have dark grey-brown upperparts with black mottling and a dark head with little white. Juvenile birds have a pale brown head and pale fringes to the upperpart feathers creating a scaly impression.

Birds of the subspecies &quot;morinella&quot; are smaller with darker upperparts and less streaking on the crown.

The ruddy turnstone has a staccato, rattling call and also a chattering alarm-call which is mainly given during the breeding season.
==Distribution==

The ruddy turnstone breeds in northern latitudes, usually no more than a few kilometres from the sea. The subspecies &quot;A. i. morinella&quot; occurs in northern Alaska and in Arctic Canada as far east as Baffin Island. &quot;A. i. interpres&quot; breeds in western Alaska, Ellesmere Island, Greenland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia and northern Russia. It formerly bred on the Baltic coast of Germany and has possibly bred in Scotland and the Faroe Islands.

In the Americas, the species winters on coastlines from Washington and Massachusetts southwards to the southern tip of South America although it is scarce in southern parts of Chile and Argentina and is only an unconfirmed vagrant in the Falkland Islands. In Europe, it winters in western regions from Iceland, Norway and Denmark southwards. Only small numbers are found on Mediterranean coasts. In Africa, it is common all the way down to South Africa with good numbers on many offshore islands. In Asia, it is widespread in the south with birds wintering as far north as southern China and Japan (mainly in the Ryukyu Islands). It occurs south to Tasmania and New Zealand and is present on many Pacific islands. Some non-breeding birds remain year round in many parts of the wintering range, with some of those birds still taking on breeding plumage in the spring and summer.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding and diet===
The ruddy turnstone has a varied diet including carrion, eggs, fish and plant material but it feeds mainly on invertebrates. Insects and their larvae are particularly important in the breeding season. At other times it also takes crustaceans, spiders, molluscs, and worms. It often flips over stones and other objects to get at prey items hiding underneath; this behaviour is the origin of the name &quot;turnstone&quot;. It usually forages in flocks.

They have also been observed preying on the eggs of other bird species such as gulls, terns, ducks, and even other turnstones, though this behaviour is uncommon. In the majority of observed cases, turnstones typically go after undefended or unattended nests, puncturing the shells with their beaks to get at the contents within.

Ruddy turnstones engage in a variety of behaviours to locate and capture prey. These behaviours can be placed into six general categories:

* Routing: The turnstone manipulates piles of seaweed through flicking, bulldozing, and pecking to expose small crustaceans or gastropod molluscs hidden underneath.
* Turning stones: As suggested by its name, the turnstone flicks stones with its bill to uncover hidden littorinids and gammarid amphipods.
* Digging: With small flicks of its bill, the turnstone creates holes in the ground substrate (usually sand or mud) and then pecks at the exposed prey – often sandhoppers or seaweed flies.
* Probing: The turnstone inserts its bill more than a quarter-length into the ground to get at littorinids and other gastropods.
* Hammer–probing: The turnstone cracks open its prey&#x27;s shell by using its bill as a hammer, and then extracts the animal inside through pecking and probing.
* Surface pecking: The turnstone uses short, shallow pecks (less than a quarter bill-length) to get at prey at or just below the ground&#x27;s surface.

There is evidence that turnstones vary between these feeding behaviours based on individual preference, sex, and even social status with respect to other turnstones. In one studied population, dominant individuals tended to engage in routing while preventing subordinates from doing the same. When these dominant individuals were temporarily removed, some of the subordinates started to rout, while others enacted no change in foraging strategy.

===Aggression and territory defence===
When foraging, turnstones adopt different postures indicative of their level of dominance. A lowered tail and a hunched stance is associated with chasing and aggression, and thus a dominant individual. Dominance in aggression is age-related, with juveniles assuming the subordinate role a disproportionate amount of the time.

The plumage patterns of ruddy turnstones exhibit an unusual amount of variation in comparison with other shorebirds. Turnstones use these unique plumage patterns to recognize individuals and discriminate intruders in their territory from neighbours occupying an adjacent territory. When a fake fiberglass turnstone model is placed in a turnstone&#x27;s territory, the occupant is less likely to respond aggressively if the model is painted to have the plumage pattern of a neighbouring turnstone.

===Ecology===
Ruddy turnstones can survive in a wide range of habitats and climatic conditions from Arctic to tropical. The typical breeding habitat is open tundra with water nearby. Outside the breeding season, it is found along coasts, particularly on rocky or stony shores. It is often found on man-made structures such as breakwaters and jetties. It may venture onto open grassy areas near the coast. Small numbers sometimes turn up on inland wetlands, especially during the spring and autumn migrations.

In terms of wintering sites, ruddy turnstones are particularly faithful to specific locations. A study published in 2009 examined turnstones wintering along a stretch of coastline in the Firth of Clyde. It found that 95% of birds resident to the area at the end of winter returned the following autumn. The same study also confirmed ruddy turnstones as one of the longest lived wader species, with annual adult mortality rates of under 15%. Their average lifespan is 9 years with 19 years and 2 months being the longest recorded.

===Reproduction===
It is a monogamous bird and pairs may remain together for more than one breeding season. The nest is a shallow scrape, often with a lining of leaves. It is about across and deep. It may be built amongst vegetation or on bare stony or rocky ground. Several pairs may nest close together.

A single clutch of two to five eggs is laid with four being most common. The eggs measure about and weigh around . They are smooth, slightly glossy and oval to pear-shaped. They are variable in colour but are commonly pale green-brown with dark brown markings, densest at the larger end. Incubation begins when the first egg is laid and lasts for about 22–24 days. The female is mainly responsible for incubating the eggs but the male may help towards the end.

The young birds are precocial and are able to leave the nest soon after hatching. They are buff above with dark grey markings and are white below. They are able to feed themselves but are protected by the parents, particularly the male. They fledge after 19–21 days.

==Status and conservation==
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the ruddy turnstone population is currently very stable. Environment Canada surveys suggest that they have in fact decreased in abundance relative to the 1970s (up to 50% by one estimate) and face a variety of threats during migration and winter. They estimate that the Canadian population is 100,000–500,000 adults. The Canadian Wildlife Service estimates that the worldwide population of ruddy turnstones is 449,000, and that 235,000 are breeding in North America while the rest are breeding throughout the Arctic regions. They are very common and widespread. Their remote breeding range and widespread winter range should help them remain a common species.

<text>The black turnstone (Arenaria melanocephala) is a species of small wading bird. It is one of two species of turnstone in the genus &quot;Arenaria&quot; the ruddy turnstone (&quot;A. interpres&quot;) being the other. It is now classified in the sandpiper family, Scolopacidae, but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family, Charadriidae. It is native to the west coast of North America and breeds only in Alaska.

==Description==

It is 22–25 centimeters long and weighs 100–170 grams. The black bill is 20–27 millimeters long and slightly upturned. The legs and feet are blackish-brown with a reddish tinge. The bird is largely black and white in appearance. Breeding-plumaged adults have a black head and breast apart from a white spot between the eye and bill, a white stripe over the eye and white flecks on the sides of the breast. The upperparts are blackish-brown with pale fringes to the wing-coverts and scapular feathers. The belly and vent are white. In flight it shows a white wingbar, white shoulder patch and white tail with a broad black band across it. There is white from the lower back to the uppertail-coverts apart from a dark bar across the rump.

In winter the head and breast become largely dark brown with little white. Juveniles are similar to winter adults but browner with buff fringes to the wing-coverts and scapulars and a grey-brown tip to the tail.

The ruddy turnstone is similar but has rufous-brown markings on the upperparts and more white on the head and breast, particularly in breeding plumage. It has narrower wings and a narrower white wingbar. Its legs are orange and brighter than those of the black turnstone though there can be some overlap.

The black turnstone has a variety of calls, especially a rattling trill which can be heard throughout the year. This call is higher and less harsh than the similar call of the ruddy turnstone. Other calls include a loud, screeching alarm call and a soft, purring call uttered to young chicks. Displaying males produce a long series of staccato notes in flight as well as chirruping trills on the ground.

==Distribution==
It breeds in western Alaska from the Alaska Peninsula in the south to Point Hope in the north. The bulk of the population nests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. It usually nests near the coast but in some areas it occurs further inland along the shores of rivers and lakes. There are a handful of records from north-east Siberia but there has been no sign of breeding there. The world population is estimated at 95,000 birds with about 80,000 of these in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.

It winters on rocky shores along the Pacific coast of North America from southern Alaska southwards as far as north-west Mexico where it occurs in Baja California and Sonora with a single record from Nayarit. It is very occasionally seen inland during spring and fall migration; there are a number of records from the Salton Sea in southern California and scattered sightings from inland US states including Montana, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona. Vagrant birds have been recorded from Yukon and the Northwest Territories and there is one record from San Cristóbal Island in the Galápagos Islands.

==Ecology==

It feeds mainly on invertebrates, particularly crustaceans and mollusks in winter and insects during the breeding season. Seeds, eggs and carrion are also taken. At the breeding grounds it mainly feeds in wet meadows with sedges. In winter, its typical habitat is rocky coasts but it also feeds on beaches, mudflats and man-made structures such as jetties and breakwaters. It uses its bill to turn over stones, algal mats and other objects to get at prey hidden beneath.

It arrives on its breeding ground from early May to early June with the males arriving first. The birds often return to the same territory and pair with the same mate as previous years. The nest is a scrape dug mainly by the male. It is usually located amongst sedges or grasses or under willows. Four eggs are usually laid; they are olive or pale greenish with darker spots. The eggs are incubated for 21–24 days by both parents. The young birds are precocial and are able to leave the nest and feed themselves soon after hatching. They are able to fly well after 25–34 days.

<text>In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.

In the special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal. If the graph is undirected (i.e. all of its edges are bidirectional), the adjacency matrix is symmetric. 
The relationship between a graph and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of its adjacency matrix is studied in spectral graph theory.

The adjacency matrix of a graph should be distinguished from its incidence matrix, a different matrix representation whose elements indicate whether vertex–edge pairs are incident or not, and its degree matrix, which contains information about the degree of each vertex.

==Definition==
For a simple graph with vertex set , the adjacency matrix is a square matrix such that its element is 1 when there is an edge from vertex to vertex , and 0 when there is no edge. The diagonal elements of the matrix are all 0, since edges from a vertex to itself (loops) are not allowed in simple graphs. It is also sometimes useful in algebraic graph theory to replace the nonzero elements with algebraic variables. The same concept can be extended to multigraphs and graphs with loops by storing the number of edges between each two vertices in the corresponding matrix element, and by allowing nonzero diagonal elements. Loops may be counted either once (as a single edge) or twice (as two vertex-edge incidences), as long as a consistent convention is followed. Undirected graphs often use the latter convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed graphs typically use the former convention.

===Of a bipartite graph===

The adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph whose two parts have and vertices can be written in the form 
: formula_1
where is an matrix, and and represent the and zero matrices. In this case, the smaller matrix uniquely represents the graph, and the remaining parts of can be discarded as redundant. is sometimes called the &quot;biadjacency matrix&quot;.

Formally, let be a bipartite graph with parts , and edges . The biadjacency matrix is the 0–1 matrix in which if and only if .

If is a bipartite multigraph or weighted graph, then the elements are taken to be the number of edges between the vertices or the weight of the edge , respectively.

===Variations===
An -adjacency matrix of a simple graph has if is an edge, if it is not, and on the diagonal. The Seidel adjacency matrix is a -adjacency matrix. This matrix is used in studying strongly regular graphs and two-graphs.

The distance matrix has in position the distance between vertices and . The distance is the length of a shortest path connecting the vertices. Unless lengths of edges are explicitly provided, the length of a path is the number of edges in it. The distance matrix resembles a high power of the adjacency matrix, but instead of telling only whether or not two vertices are connected (i.e., the connection matrix, which contains Boolean values), it gives the exact distance between them.

==Examples==
===Undirected graphs===
The convention followed here (for undirected graphs) is that each edge adds 1 to the appropriate cell in the matrix, and each loop (an edge from a vertex to itself) adds 2 to the appropriate cell on the diagonal in the matrix. This allows the degree of a vertex to be easily found by taking the sum of the values in either its respective row or column in the adjacency matrix.

===Directed graphs===
The adjacency matrix of a directed graph can be asymmetric. One can define the adjacency matrix of a directed graph either such that 
# a non-zero element indicates an edge from to or 
# it indicates an edge from to .

The former definition is commonly used in graph theory and social network analysis (e.g., sociology, political science, economics, psychology). The latter is more common in other applied sciences (e.g., dynamical systems, physics, network science) where is sometimes used to describe linear dynamics on graphs.

Using the first definition, the in-degrees of a vertex can be computed by summing the entries of the corresponding column and the out-degree of vertex by summing the entries of the corresponding row. When using the second definition, the in-degree of a vertex is given by the corresponding row sum and the out-degree is given by the corresponding column sum.

===Trivial graphs===
The adjacency matrix of a complete graph contains all ones except along the diagonal where there are only zeros. The adjacency matrix of an empty graph is a zero matrix.

==Properties==
===Spectrum===
The adjacency matrix of an undirected simple graph is symmetric, and therefore has a complete set of real eigenvalues and an orthogonal eigenvector basis. The set of eigenvalues of a graph is the spectrum of the graph. It is common to denote the eigenvalues by formula_2

The greatest eigenvalue formula_3 is bounded above by the maximum degree. This can be seen as result of the Perron–Frobenius theorem, but it can be proved easily. Let be one eigenvector associated to formula_3 and the entry in which has maximum absolute value. Without loss of generality assume is positive since otherwise you simply take the eigenvector -, also associated to formula_3. Then

: formula_6

For -regular graphs, is the first eigenvalue of for the vector (it is easy to check that it is an eigenvalue and it is the maximum because of the above bound). The multiplicity of this eigenvalue is the number of connected components of , in particular formula_7 for connected graphs. It can be shown that for each eigenvalue formula_8, its opposite formula_9 is also an eigenvalue of if is a bipartite graph. In particular − is an eigenvalue of any -regular bipartite graph.

The difference formula_10 is called the spectral gap and it is related to the expansion of . It is also useful to introduce the spectral radius of formula_11 denoted by formula_12. This number is bounded by formula_13. This bound is tight in the Ramanujan graphs, which have applications in many areas.

===Isomorphism and invariants===
Suppose two directed or undirected graphs and with adjacency matrices and are given. and are isomorphic if and only if there exists a permutation matrix such that
: formula_14

In particular, and are similar and therefore have the same minimal polynomial, characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues, determinant and trace. These can therefore serve as isomorphism invariants of graphs. However, two graphs may possess the same set of eigenvalues but not be isomorphic. Such linear operators are said to be isospectral.

===Matrix powers===
If is the adjacency matrix of the directed or undirected graph , then the matrix (i.e., the matrix product of copies of ) has an interesting interpretation: the element gives the number of (directed or undirected) walks of length from vertex to vertex . If is the smallest nonnegative integer, such that for some , , the element of is positive, then is the distance between vertex and vertex . A great example of how this is useful is in counting the number of triangles in an undirected graph , which is exactly the trace of divided by 3 or 6 depending on whether the graph is directed or not. We divide by those values to compensate for the overcounting of each triangle. In an undirected graph, each triangle will be counted twice for all three nodes, because the path can be followed clockwise or counterclockwise : ijk or ikj. The adjacency matrix can be used to determine whether or not the graph is connected.

If a directed graph has a nilpotent adjacency matrix (i.e., if there exists such that is the zero matrix), then it is a directed acyclic graph.

==Data structures==
The adjacency matrix may be used as a data structure for the representation of graphs in computer programs for manipulating graphs. The main alternative data structure, also in use for this application, is the adjacency list.

The space needed to represent an adjacency matrix and the time needed to perform operations on them is dependent on the matrix representation chosen for the underlying matrix. Sparse matrix representations only store non-zero matrix entries and implicitly represent the zero entries. They can, for example, be used to represent sparse graphs without incurring the space overhead from storing the many zero entries in the adjacency matrix of the sparse graph. In the following section the adjacency matrix is assumed to be represented by an array data structure so that zero and non-zero entries are all directly represented in storage.

Because each entry in the adjacency matrix requires only one bit, it can be represented in a very compact way, occupying only |&quot;V&quot; |2&amp;hairsp;/&amp;hairsp;8 bytes to represent a directed graph, or (by using a packed triangular format and only storing the lower triangular part of the matrix) approximately |&quot;V&quot; |2&amp;hairsp;/&amp;hairsp;16 bytes to represent an undirected graph. Although slightly more succinct representations are possible, this method gets close to the information-theoretic lower bound for the minimum number of bits needed to represent all -vertex graphs. For storing graphs in text files, fewer bits per byte can be used to ensure that all bytes are text characters, for instance by using a Base64 representation. Besides avoiding wasted space, this compactness encourages locality of reference.
However, for a large sparse graph, adjacency lists require less storage space, because they do not waste any space representing edges that are &quot;not&quot; present.

An alternative form of adjacency matrix (which, however, requires a larger amount of space) replaces the numbers in each element of the matrix with pointers to edge objects (when edges are present) or null pointers (when there is no edge). It is also possible to store edge weights directly in the elements of an adjacency matrix.

Besides the space tradeoff, the different data structures also facilitate different operations. Finding all vertices adjacent to a given vertex in an adjacency list is as simple as reading the list, and takes time proportional to the number of neighbors. With an adjacency matrix, an entire row must instead be scanned, which takes a larger amount of time, proportional to the number of vertices in the whole graph. On the other hand, testing whether there is an edge between two given vertices can be determined at once with an adjacency matrix, while requiring time proportional to the minimum degree of the two vertices with the adjacency list.

<text>Zhu Xi (; October 18, 1130April 23, 1200), formerly romanized Chu Hsi, was a Chinese calligrapher, historian, philosopher, poet, and politician of the Southern Song dynasty. Zhu was influential in the development of Neo-Confucianism. He contributed greatly to Chinese philosophy and fundamentally reshaped the Chinese worldview. His works include his editing of and commentaries to the Four Books (which later formed the curriculum of the imperial examinations in China between 1313 and 1905), his writings on the process of the &#x27;investigation of things&#x27; (), and his development of meditation as a method for self-cultivation.

Zhu was a scholar with a wide learning in the classics, commentaries, histories and other writings of his predecessors. In his lifetime, he was able to serve multiple times as a government official, although he avoided public office for most of his adult life. He also wrote, compiled and edited almost a hundred books and corresponded with dozens of other scholars. He acted as a teacher to groups of students, many of whom chose to study under him for years. He built upon the teachings of the Cheng brothers and others, further developing their metaphysical theories in regards to principle (&quot;li&quot;) and vital force (qi). His followers recorded thousands of his conversations in writing.

==Life==
Zhu Xi, whose family originated in Wuyuan County, Huizhou (in modern Jiangxi province), was born in Fujian, where his father worked as the subprefectural sheriff. After his father was forced from office due to his opposition to the government appeasement policy towards the Jurchen in 1140, Zhu Xi received instruction from his father at home. Many anecdotes attest that he was a highly precocious child. It was recorded that at age five he ventured to ask what lay beyond Heaven, and by eight he understood the significance of the Classic of Filiality (&quot;Xiaojing&quot;). As a youth, he was inspired by Mencius&#x27; proposition that anyone could become a sage. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1143, he studied with his father&#x27;s friends Hu Xian, Liu Zihui, and Liu Mianzhi. In 1148, at the age of 19, Zhu Xi passed the Imperial Examination and became a presented scholar (&quot;jinshi&quot;). Zhu Xi&#x27;s first official dispatch position was as Subprefectural Registrar of Tong&#x27;an (), which he served from 1153 - 1156. From 1153 he began to study under Li Tong, who followed the Neo-Confucian tradition of Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi, and formally became his student in 1160.

In 1179, after not serving in an official capacity since 1156, Zhu Xi was appointed Prefect of Nankang Military District (), where he revived White Deer Grotto Academy. and got demoted three years later for attacking the incompetency and corruption of some influential officials. There were several instances of receiving an appointment and subsequently being demoted. Upon dismissal from his last appointment, he was accused of numerous crimes and a petition was made for his execution. Much of this opposition was headed by Han Tuozhou, the Prime Minister, who was a political rival of Zhu&#x27;s. Even though his teachings had been severely attacked by establishment figures, almost a thousand brave people attended his funeral. After the death of Han Tuozhou, Zhu&#x27;s successor Zhen Dexiu, together with Wei Liaoweng, made Zhu&#x27;s branch of Neo-Confucianism the dominant philosophy at the Song Court.

In 1208, eight years after his death, Emperor Ningzong of Song rehabilitated Zhu Xi and honored him with the posthumous name of Wen Gong (), meaning &quot;Venerable gentleman of culture&quot;. Around 1228, Emperor Lizong of Song honored him with the posthumous noble title Duke of (State) Hui (). In 1241, a memorial tablet to Zhu Xi was placed in the Confucian Temple at Qufu, thereby elevating him to Confucian sainthood. Today, Zhu Xi is venerated as one of the &quot;Twelve Philosophers&quot; of Confucianism. Modern Sinologists and Chinese often refer to him as Zhu Wen Gong () in lieu of his name.

==Teachings==

===The Four Books===
During the Song dynasty, Zhu Xi&#x27;s teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the &quot;I Ching&quot; like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the &quot;Great Learning&quot;, the &quot;Doctrine of the Mean&quot;, the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot;, and the &quot;Mencius&quot; as the core curriculum for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as the standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations up until 1905, and education in the classics often began with Zhu Xi&#x27;s commentaries as the cornerstone for understanding them.

The sources of Zhu Xi&#x27;s new approach to the Confucian curriculum have been found in several works of the Cheng brothers. Zhu Xi &quot;codified the Cheng brothers&#x27; teachings and reworked them into his own philosophical program,&quot; moving &quot;from philology to philosophy.&quot;

===Vital force, principle, and the Supreme Ultimate===
Zhu Xi maintained that all things are brought into being by the union of two universal aspects of reality: &quot;qi&quot; (, sometimes translated as vital – or physical, material – force); and &quot;li&quot; (, sometimes translated as rational principle or law). The source and sum of &quot;li&quot; is the &quot;taiji&quot;, meaning the Supreme Ultimate. The source of &quot;qi&quot; is not so clearly stated by Zhu Xi, leading some authorities to maintain that he was a metaphysical monist and others to maintain that he was a metaphysical dualist.

According to Zhu Xi&#x27;s theory, every physical object and every person has its &quot;li&quot; and therefore has contact in its metaphysical core with the &quot;taiji&quot;. What is referred to as the human soul, mind, or spirit is understood as the &quot;taiji&quot;, or the supreme creative principle, as it works its way out in a person.

&quot;Qi&quot; and &quot;li&quot; operate together in mutual dependence. They are mutually aspective in all creatures in the universe. These two aspects are manifested in the creation of substantial entities. When their activity is waxing (rapid or expansive), that is the &quot;yang&quot; energy mode. When their activity is waning (slow or contractive), that is the &quot;yin&quot; energy mode. The yang and yin phases constantly interact, each gaining and losing dominance over the other. In the process of the waxing and waning, the alternation of these fundamental vibrations, the so-called five elements evolve (fire, water, wood, metal, and earth). Zhu Xi argues that &quot;li&quot; existed even before Heaven and Earth.

In terms of &quot;li&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;, Zhu Xi&#x27;s system strongly resembles Buddhist ideas of &quot;li&quot; (principle) and &quot;shi&quot; (affairs, matters), though Zhu Xi and his followers strongly argued that they were not copying Buddhist ideas. Instead, they held, they were using concepts already present long before in the &quot;I Ching.&quot;

Zhu Xi discussed how he saw the Supreme Ultimate concept to be compatible with principle of Taoism, but his concept of &quot;taiji&quot; was different from the understanding of &quot;Tao&quot; in Daoism. Where &quot;taiji&quot; is a differentiating principle that results in the emergence of something new, &quot;Dao&quot; is still and silent, operating to reduce all things to equality and indistinguishability. He argued that there is a central harmony that is not static or empty but was dynamic, and that the Supreme Ultimate is itself in constant creative activity.

===Human nature===
Zhu Xi considered the earlier Confucian Xunzi to be a heretic for departing from Mengzi&#x27;s idea of innate human goodness. Even if people displayed immoral behaviour, the supreme regulative principle was good. The cause of immoral actions is &quot;qi&quot;. Zhu Xi&#x27;s metaphysics is that everything contains &quot;li&quot; and &quot;qi&quot;. &quot;Li&quot; is the principle that is in everything and governs the universe. Each person has a perfect &quot;li&quot;. As such, individuals should act in perfect accordance with morality. However, while &quot;li&quot; is the underlying structure, &quot;qi&quot; is also part of everything. &quot;Qi&quot; obscures our perfect moral nature. The task of moral cultivation is to clear our &quot;qi.&quot; If our &quot;qi&quot; is clear and balanced, then we will act in a perfectly moral way.

===Heart/mind===
&quot;Heart&quot; and &quot;mind&quot; are both expressed in Chinese with the same word &quot;xin&quot; (); clarity of mind and purity of heart are ideal in Confucian philosophy. In the following poem, &quot;Reflections While Reading - 1&quot; Zhu Xi illustrates this concept by comparing the mind to a mirror, left covered until needed that simply reflects the world around it, staying clear by the flowing waters symbolizing the &quot;Tao&quot;. In Chinese, the mind was sometimes called &quot;the square inch&quot;, which is the literal translation of the term alluded to in the beginning of the poem.
===Knowledge and action===
According to Zhu Xi&#x27;s epistemology, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought, and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said &quot;Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important.&quot;

===The investigation of things and the extension of knowledge===
Zhu Xi advocated the investigation of things (). How to investigate and what these things are is the source of much debate. To Zhu Xi, the things are moral principles and the investigation involves paying attention to everything in both books and affairs because &quot;moral principles are quite inexhaustible&quot;.

=== Religion ===
Zhu Xi did believe in the existence of spirits, ghosts, divination, and blessings.

===Meditation===
Zhu Xi practiced a form of daily meditation called &quot;jingzuo&quot; similar to, but not the same as, Buddhist &quot;dhyana&quot; or &quot;chan ding&quot; (; Wade–Giles &quot;chan-ting&quot;). His meditation did not require the cessation of all thinking as in some forms of Buddhism; rather, it was characterised by quiet introspection that helped to balance various aspects of one&#x27;s personality and allowed for focused thought and concentration.

His form of meditation was by nature Confucian in the sense that it was concerned with morality. His meditation attempted to reason and feel in harmony with the universe. He believed that this type of meditation brought humanity closer together and more into harmony.

===On teaching, learning, and the creation of an academy===

Zhu Xi heavily focused his energy on teaching, claiming that learning is the only way to sage-hood. He wished to make the pursuit of sage-hood attainable to all men.

He lamented more modern printing techniques and the proliferation of books that ensued. This, he believed, made students less appreciative and focused on books, simply because there were more books to read than before. Therefore, he attempted to redefine how students should learn and read. In fact, disappointed by local schools in China, he established his own academy, White Deer Grotto Academy, to instruct students properly and in the proper fashion.

==Taoist and Buddhist influence on Zhu Xi==
Zhu Xi wrote what was to become the orthodox Confucian interpretation of a number of concepts in Taoism and Buddhism. While he appeared to have adopted some ideas from these competing systems of thought, unlike previous Neo-Confucians he strictly abided by the Confucian doctrine of active moral cultivation. He found Buddhist principles to be darkening and deluding the original mind as well as destroying human relations.

==Legacy==
From 1313 to 1905, Zhu Xi&#x27;s commentaries on the Four Books formed the basis of civil service examinations in China. His teachings were to dominate Neo-Confucians such as Wang Fuzhi, though dissenters would later emerge such as Wang Yangming and the School of Mind two and a half centuries later.

His philosophy survived the Intellectual Revolution of 1917, and later Feng Youlan would interpret his conception of &quot;li&quot;, &quot;qi&quot;, and &quot;taiji&quot; into a new metaphysical theory.

He was also influential in Japan known as &quot;Shushigaku&quot; (朱子学, School of Master Zhu), and in Korea known as &quot;Jujahak&quot; (주자학), where it became an orthodoxy. He also influenced Confucianism in Vietnam.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine ranked Zhu Xi as the forty-fifth most important person in the last millennium.

Zhu Xi&#x27;s descendants, like those of Confucius and other notable Confucians, held the hereditary title of Wujing Boshi (五经博士; ; Wǔjīng Bóshì), which translated means Erudite or Doctor of the Five Classics and enjoyed the rank of 8a in the Mandarin (bureaucrat) system.

==Calligraphy==
Zhu Xi had, from an early age, followed his father and a number of great calligraphers at the time in practicing calligraphy. At first he learned the style of Cao Cao, but later specialized in the regular script of Zhong Yao and the running cursive script of Yan Zhenqing. Though his manuscripts left to the world are piecemeal and incomplete, and most of his works are lost. Moreover, his fame in the realm of philosophy was so great that even his brilliance in calligraphy was overshadowed. He was skillful in both running and cursive scripts, especially in large characters, but extant artworks consist mainly of short written notes in running script and rarely of large characters. His authentic manuscripts are collected by Nanjing Museum, Beijing Palace Museum, Liaoning Province Museum, Taipei Palace Museum and the National Museum of Tokyo, Japan. Some pieces are in private collections in China and overseas. The &quot;Thatched Hut Hand Scroll&quot;, one of Zhu Xi&#x27;s masterpieces in running-cursive script, is in an overseas private collection.
&quot;Thatched Hut Hand Scroll&quot; contains three separate parts:

# Title
# 102 characters by Zhu Xi in running cursive scripts
# The postscripts by Wen Tianxiang (1236～1283) of Song dynasty, Fang Xiaoru (1375～1402), Zhu Yunming (1460–1526), Tang Yin (1470～1523) and Hai Rui (1514～1587) of the Ming dynasty.

===Calligraphy style===

The calligraphy of Zhu Xi had been acclaimed as acquiring the style of the Han and Wei dynasties. He was skillful in the central tip, and his brush strokes are smooth and round, steady yet flowing in the movements without any trace of frivolity and abruptness. Indeed, his calligraphy possesses stability and elegance in construction with a continuous flow of energy. Without trying to be pretentious or intentional, his written characters are well-balanced, natural and unconventional. As he was a patriarch of Confucianism philosophy, it is understandable that his learning permeated in all his writings with due respect for traditional standards. He maintained that while rules had to be observed for each word, there should be room for tolerance, multiplicity and naturalness. In other words, calligraphy had to observe rules and at the same time not be bound by them so as to express the quality of naturalness. It is small wonder that his calligraphy had been highly esteemed throughout the centuries, by great personages as follows:

Tao Chung Yi (around 1329～1412) of the Ming dynasty:
Whilst Master Zhu inherited the orthodox teaching and propagated it to the realm of sages and yet he was also proficient in running and cursive scripts, especially in large characters. His execution of brush was well-poised and elegant. However piecemeal or isolated his manuscripts, they were eagerly sought after and treasured.
Wang Sai Ching (1526–1590) of the Ming dynasty:
The brush strokes in his calligraphy were swift without attempting at formality, yet none of his strokes and dots were not in conformity with the rules of calligraphy.
Wen Tianxiang of the Song dynasty in his postscript for the &quot;Thatched Hut Hand Scroll&quot; by Zhu Xi:
People in the olden days said that there was embedded the bones of loyal subject in the calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing. Observing the execution of brush strokes by Zhu Xi, I am indeed convinced of the truth of this opinion.
Zhu Yunming of the Ming dynasty in his postscript for the &quot;Thatched Hut Hand Scroll&quot; by Zhu Xi:
Master Zhu was loyal, learned and a great scholar throughout ages . He was superb in calligraphy although he did not write much in his lifetime and hence they were rarely seen in later ages. This roll had been collected by Wong Sze Ma for a long time and of late, it appeared in the world. I chanced to see it once and whilst I regretted that I did not try to study it extensively until now, in the study room of my friend, I was so lucky to see it again. This showed that I am destined to see the manuscripts of master Zhu. I therefore wrote this preface for my intention.
Hai Rui of the Ming dynasty in his postscript for the &quot;Thatched Hut Hand Scroll&quot; by Zhu Xi:
The writings are enticing, delicate, elegant and outstanding. Truly such calligraphy piece is the wonder of nature.

<doc id="244473" wikidata="Q712195" url="?curid=244473" title="Publius Sulpicius Rufus">
<text>Publius Sulpicius Rufus (124–88 BC) was a Roman politician and orator whose attempts to pass controversial laws with the help of mob violence helped trigger the first civil war of the Roman Republic. His actions kindled the deadly rivalry between Gaius Marius and Sulla, and provided the pretext for Sulla&#x27;s unexpected march on Rome.

==Life==
===Background and early career===
Publius Sulpicius Rufus was probably born in 124 BC. His precise background is unclear: It is unknown if he was related to the jurist and near-contemporary Servius Sulpicius Rufus, and, like him, he might not have been a patrician, despite their matching family names. It is likely, nevertheless, that he was of high birth, as he was personally acquainted to some of the most important aristocrats of the day. These included the orators Lucius Licinius Crassus and Marcus Antonius, of whom Sulpicius was a close friend as well as disciple. Sulpicius himself came to be regarded as one of the finest orators of his generation. Together with two highborn friends of his, Marcus Livius Drusus (son of the opponent of Gaius Gracchus) and Gaius Aurelius Cotta (uncle of Julius Caesar), Sulpicius formed a circle of &quot;talented and energetic young aristocrats&quot; in whom and the older generation of Roman senators placed great hope for the future.

In 95 BC, Sulpicius, with the encouragement and approval of the nobility, led an eloquent but ultimately unsuccessful prosecution of a former tribune of the plebs, Gaius Norbanus. This was his first major public performance, and he continued working as an advocate in the courts during the following years. He soon became involved in politics as a close ally of his friend, Livius Drusus, during the latter&#x27;s eventful term as tribune of the plebs in 91 BC. Their circle seems to have identified with the cause of moderate reform within the establishment, that sought to maintain and perpetuate the ruling class&#x27;s hold on power by making their rule more palatable to the ruled. To that end, Drusus as tribune had proposed several ambitious reforms which included the transfer of the state courts from the equestrian class to the Senate, the granting of full citizenship to Rome&#x27;s restive non-citizen allies across Italy, and distribution of land and grain to the poor. To continue Drusus&#x27;s work, his friends Aurelius Cotta and Sulpicius agreed to follow him on the tribunate in successive years, the former in 90 BC and Sulpicius himself in 89.

===Failure of reform and war===
Drusus&#x27;s attempts at reform and catering to many diverse interests simultaneously ended in failure. The equestrians strongly resisted his proposals to deprive them of the courts, and Drusus was unable to reach a compromise that was acceptable to both them and the senatorial nobility. Shortly after a meeting of supporters at a villa of Lucius Licinius Crassus near Tusculum in September 91 BC, at which Sulpicius was present, Crassus himself died, depriving Drusus of his mentor and main supporter in the Senate. Drusus himself was murdered under mysterious circumstances shortly afterwards. Rome&#x27;s Italian allies, with their desire for citizenship stymied, soon broke away in rebellion, beginning the Social War.

The outbreak of the Social War was followed by several politically motivated prosecutions as part of the equestrian class&#x27;s reaction to Drusus&#x27;s legislative proposals. One tribune, Varius, established a commission to prosecute Drusus&#x27;s supporters on the charge that their attempts to appease the Italian allies with promises of citizenship had encouraged them to revolt. Sulpicius&#x27;s friend, Cotta, who was supposed to succeed Drusus in the tribunate, was forced into exile to avoid condemnation, and Sulpicius himself narrowly avoided prosecution, probably because he then undertook military service against the Italian rebels. Sulpicius served in the conflict with the rank of lieutenant (), but his activities during it cannot be known with certainty.

===Tribune of the plebs (89–88 BC)===
Soon afterwards Sulpicius declared in favour of Gaius Marius and the populares, a move considered to be a surprising &quot;volte face&quot; by contemporaries: Cicero, for instance, remarks that &#x27;the popular breeze carried Sulpicius, who had set out from an excellent position, further than he wished&#x27; He was deeply in debt, and it seems that Marius had promised him financial assistance in the event of his being appointed to the command in the Mithridatic Wars, to which Sulla had already been appointed. To secure the appointment for Marius, Sulpicius brought in a franchise bill by which the newly enfranchised Italian allies and freedmen would have swamped the old electors. The majority of the senate were strongly opposed to the proposal; a &quot;justitium&quot; (cessation of public business) was proclaimed by the consuls Sulla and Pompeius Rufus, but Marius and Sulpicius fomented a riot, and the consuls, in fear of their lives, withdrew the &quot;justitium&quot;. The proposals of Sulpicius became law, and, with the assistance of the new voters, the command was bestowed upon Marius, at the time a &quot;privatus&quot; holding no elected office.

Sulla, who was then at Nola, immediately marched upon Rome. Marius and Sulpicius, unable to resist him, fled from the city. Marius managed to escape to Africa, but Sulpicius was discovered in a villa at Laurentum and put to death; his head was sent to Sulla and exposed in the forum, and his laws annulled.

Sulpicius appears to have been originally a moderate reformer, who by force of circumstances became one of the leaders of a democratic revolt. Although he had impeached the turbulent tribune Gaius Norbanus in 95 BC, and resisted the proposal to repeal judicial sentences by popular decree, he did not hesitate to incur the displeasure of the Julian family by opposing the illegal candidature for the consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar Strabo Vopiscus, who had never been praetor and was consequently ineligible. Sulpicius&#x27; franchise proposals, as far as the Italians were concerned, were a necessary measure of justice; but they had been carried by violence.

Cicero as a young man went almost daily to see Sulpicius speak as tribune in the Forum (&quot;Brutus&quot;, 306), and judged him an able orator. Of his skills, Cicero says (&quot;Brutus&quot;, 210): &quot;Sulpicius indeed was of all orators whom I have ever heard the most elevated in style, and, so to speak, the most theatrical. His voice was strong and at the same time pleasing and of brilliant timbre; his gesture and bodily movement extraordinarily graceful, but with a grace that seemed made for the forum rather than for the stage; his language was swift and of easy flow without being either redundant or verbose. He had fixed on Crassus as his model; Cotta had chosen rather Antonius. But Cotta lacked the force of Antonius, Sulpicius the charm of Crassus.&quot; Sulpicius left no written speeches, those that bore his name being written by a Publius Canutius. Sulpicius is one of the interlocutors in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De oratore&quot;.

<text>The imperial examination was a civil service examination system in Imperial China administered for the purpose of selecting candidates for the state bureaucracy. The concept of choosing bureaucrats by merit rather than by birth started early in Chinese history, but using written examinations as a tool of selection started in earnest during the Sui dynasty (581–618), then into the Tang dynasty (618–907). The system became dominant during the Song dynasty (960–1279) and lasted for almost a millennium until its abolition during the late Qing dynasty reforms in 1905. The key sponsors for abolition were Yuan Shikai, Yin Chang and Zhang Zhidong. Aspects of the imperial examination still exist for entry into the civil service of both China and Taiwan.

The exams served to ensure a common knowledge of writing, Chinese classics, and literary style among state officials. This common culture helped to unify the empire, and the ideal of achievement by merit gave legitimacy to imperial rule. The examination system played a significant role in tempering the power of hereditary aristocracy and military authority, and in the rise of a gentry class of scholar-bureaucrats.

Starting with the Song dynasty, the imperial examination system became a more formal system and developed into a roughly three-tiered ladder from local to provincial to court exams. During the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), authorities narrowed the content down to mostly texts on Neo-Confucian orthodoxy; the highest degree, the &quot;jinshi&quot;, became essential for the highest offices. On the other hand, holders of the basic degree, the &quot;shengyuan&quot;, became vastly oversupplied, resulting in holders who could not hope for office. During the 19th century, the wealthy could opt into the system by educating their sons or by purchasing an office. In the late 19th century, some critics within Qing China blamed the examination system for stifling scientific and technical knowledge, and urged for reforms. At the time, China had about one civil licentiate per 1000 people. Due to the stringent requirements, there was only a 1% passing rate among the two or three million annual applicants who took the exams.

The Chinese examination system has had a profound influence in the development of modern civil service administrative functions in other countries. These include analogous structures that have existed in Japan, Korea, the Ryukyu Kingdom, and Vietnam. In addition to Asia, reports by European missionaries and diplomats introduced the Chinese examination system to the Western world and encouraged France, Germany and the British East India Company (EIC) to use similar methods to select prospective employees. Seeing its initial success within the EIC, the British government adopted a similar testing system for screening civil servants across the board throughout the United Kingdom in 1855. The United States would also establish such programs for certain government jobs after 1883.

==General history==


Tests of skill such as archery contests have existed since the Zhou dynasty (or, more mythologically, Yao). The Confucian characteristic of the later imperial exams was largely due to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han during the Han dynasty. Although some examinations did exist from the Han to the Sui dynasty, they did not offer an official avenue to government appointment, the majority of which were filled through recommendations based on qualities such as social status, morals, and ability.

The bureaucratic imperial examinations as a concept have their origins in the year 605 during the short-lived Sui dynasty. Its successor, the Tang dynasty, implemented imperial examinations on a relatively small scale until the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of Wu Zetian, ruler of Wu Zhou. Included in the expanded examination system was a military exam, but the military exam never had a significant impact on the Chinese officer corps and military degrees were seen as inferior to their civil counterpart. The exact nature of Wu&#x27;s influence on the examination system is still a matter of scholarly debate.

During the Song dynasty the emperors expanded both examinations and the government school system, in part to counter the influence of military aristocrats, increasing the number of degree holders to more than four to five times that of the Tang. From the Song dynasty onward, the examinations played the primary role in selecting scholar-officials, who formed the literati elite of society. However the examinations co-existed with other forms of recruitment such as direct appointments for the ruling family, nominations, quotas, clerical promotions, sale of official titles, and special procedures for eunuchs. The regular higher level degree examination cycle was decreed in 1067 to be three years but this triennial cycle only existed in nominal terms. In practice both before and after this, the examinations were irregularly implemented for significant periods of time: thus, the calculated statistical averages for the number of degrees conferred annually should be understood in this context. The &quot;jinshi&quot; exams were not a yearly event and should not be considered so; the annual average figures are a necessary artifact of quantitative analysis. The operations of the examination system were part of the imperial record keeping system, and the date of receiving the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree is often a key biographical datum: sometimes the date of achieving &quot;jinshi&quot; is the only firm date known for even some of the most historically prominent persons in Chinese history.

A brief interruption to the examinations occurred at the beginning of the Yuan dynasty in the 13th century, but was later brought back with regional quotas which favored the Mongols and disadvantaged Southern Chinese. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the system contributed to the narrow and focused nature of intellectual life and enhanced the autocratic power of the emperor. The system continued with some modifications until its abolition in 1905 during the late Qing reforms in the last years of the Qing dynasty. The modern examination system for selecting civil servants also indirectly evolved from the imperial one.
==Precursors==
===Han dynasty===
In the early Han dynasty, the paths to officialdom were initially monopolised by the higher aristocrats. For instance, officials of ranks 2,000-&quot;dan&quot; and above were permitted to recommend their sons and relatives into the court as attendants/Court gentlemen.

In 165 BC, Emperor Wen of Han introduced recruitment to the civil service through examinations. Previously, potential officials never sat for any sort of academic examinations. However, these examinations did not heavily emphasize Confucian material. Emperor Wu of Han&#x27;s early reign saw the creation of a series of posts for academicians in 136 BC. Ardently promoted by Dong Zhongshu, the Taixue and Imperial examination came into existence by recommendation of Gongsun Hong, chancellor under Wu. Officials would select candidates to take part in an examination of the Confucian classics, from which Emperor Wu would select officials to serve by his side. 

Gongsun intended for the Taixue&#x27;s graduates to become imperial officials but they usually only started off as clerks and attendants, and mastery of only one canonical text was required upon its founding, changing to all five in the Eastern Han. Starting with only 50 students, Emperor Zhao expanded it to 100, Emperor Xuan to 200, and Emperor Yuan to 1,000. The top graduates (Grade A, 甲科) of the Taixue were immediately admitted as Court gentlemen, while the Grade B (乙科) graduates were sent to serve probationary positions in their local commanderies. The Taixue thereby began to dilute the aristocratic backgrounds of the Court gentlemen, increasing the access of commoner scholars to official appointments. After the reign of Emperor Wu, the numbers of Court gentlemen swelled by over two hundred every year; of this number, more than half were graduates from the Taixue, increasing the proportion of non-aristocratic scholars in government. 

Emperor Wu introduced a regularised system of recommendations known as &quot;Xiaolian&quot; (Filially Pious and Incorrupt) in which each local magistrate or governor had to recommend at least one candidate to the court every year. Later, the recommendation quota would be set at one candidate for each 200,000 households. Candidates for offices recommended by the prefect of a prefecture were examined by the Ministry of Rites and then presented to the emperor. Some candidates for clerical positions would be given a test to determine whether they could memorize nine thousand Chinese characters. The &quot;proper path&quot; (正途) to official positions, which rapidly crowded out all other forms of entry, was to graduate from the Taixue, serve a probationary post in one&#x27;s local commandery, and then gain a recommendation from the local official to undergo the final civil service examinations. As a result, the Han system of official selection combined education, administrative exposure, recommendation and examinations in their procedure. In AD 132, examinations were instituted to test all &quot;Xiaolian&quot; candidates recommended to the court.

The system relied heavily on families who had access to education; before the proliferation of paper and printing, books were made of expensive or unwieldy bamboo and silk. The costs of literacy meant that relatively few could afford to become sufficiently educated for government service. Furthermore, the system of recommendations allowed high level (2,000-&quot;dan&quot;) officials to induct their family members into the government, and whenever they served as a Commandery governor they could also recommend new candidates who would be beholden to them, and were expected to repay the favour by recommending their other relatives. The kin of higher officials therefore had better chances of gaining positions.

===Three Kingdoms===
The first standardized method of recruitment in Chinese history was introduced during the Three Kingdoms period in the Kingdom of Wei. It was called the nine-rank system. In the nine-rank system, each office was given a rank from highest to lowest in descending order from one to nine. Imperial officials were responsible for assessing the quality of the talents recommended by local elites. The criteria for recruitment included qualities such as morals and social status, which in practice meant that influential families monopolized all high ranking posts while men of poorer means filled the lower ranks.

==History by dynasty==
===Sui dynasty (581–618)===
The Sui dynasty continued the tradition of recruitment through recommendation but modified it in 587 with the requirement for every prefecture (&quot;fu&quot;) to supply three scholars a year. In 599, all capital officials of rank five and above were required to make nominations for consideration in several categories.

During the Sui dynasty, examinations for &quot;classicists&quot; (&quot;mingjing ke&quot;) and &quot;cultivated talents&quot; (&quot;xiucai ke&quot;) were introduced. Classicists were tested on the Confucian canon, which was considered an easy task at the time, so those who passed were awarded posts in the lower rungs of officialdom. Cultivated talents were tested on matters of statecraft as well as the Confucian canon. In 607, Emperor Yang of Sui established a new category of examinations for the &quot;presented scholar&quot; (&quot;jinshike&quot; ). These three categories of examination were the origins of the imperial examination system that would last until 1905. Consequently, the year 607 is also considered by many to be the real beginning of the imperial examination system. The Sui dynasty was itself short lived however and the system was not developed further until much later.

The imperial examinations did not significantly shift recruitment selection in practice during the Sui dynasty. Schools at the capital still produced students for appointment. Inheritance of official status was also still practiced. Men of the merchant and artisan classes were still barred from officialdom. However the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui did see much greater expansion of government authority over officials. Under Emperor Wen (r. 581–604), all officials down to the district level had to be appointed by the Department of State Affairs in the capital and were subjected to annual merit rating evaluations. Regional Inspectors and District Magistrates had to be transferred every three years and their subordinates every four years. They were not allowed to bring their parents or adult children with them upon reassignment of territorial administration. The Sui did not establish any hereditary kingdoms or marquisates (&quot;hóu&quot;) of the Han sort. To compensate, nobles were given substantial stipends and staff. Aristocratic officials were ranked based on their pedigree with distinctions such as &quot;high expectations&quot;, &quot;pure&quot;, and &quot;impure&quot; so that they could be awarded offices appropriately.

===Tang dynasty (618–907)===

The Tang dynasty and the Zhou interregnum of Empress Wu (Wu Zetian) expanded examinations beyond the basic process of qualifying candidates based on questions of policy matters followed by an interview. Oral interviews as part of the selection process were theoretically supposed to be an unbiased process, but in practice favored candidates from elite clans based in the capitals of Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang (speakers of solely non-elite dialects could not succeed).

Under the Tang, six categories of regular civil service examinations were organized by the Department of State Affairs and held by the Ministry of Rites: cultivated talents, classicists, presented scholars, legal experts, writing experts, and arithmetic experts. Emperor Xuanzong of Tang also added categories for Daoism and apprentices. The hardest of these examination categories, the presented scholar &quot;jinshi&quot; degree, became more prominent over time until it superseded all other examinations. By the late Tang the jinshi degree became a prerequisite for appointment into higher offices. Appointments by recommendation were also required to take examinations.

The examinations were carried out in the first lunar month. After the results were completed, the list of results was submitted to the Grand Chancellor, who had the right to alter the results. Sometimes the list was also submitted to the Secretariat-Chancellery for additional inspection. The emperor could also announce a repeat of the exam. The list of results was then published in the second lunar month.

Classicists were tested by being presented phrases from the classic texts. Then they had to write the whole paragraph to complete the phrase. If the examinee was able to correctly answer five of ten questions, they passed. This was considered such an easy task that a 30-year-old candidate was said to be old for a classicist examinee, but young to be a jinshi. An oral version of the classicist examination known as &quot;moyi&quot; also existed but consisted of 100 questions rather than just ten. In contrast, the jinshi examination not only tested the Confucian classics, but also history, proficiency in compiling official documents, inscriptions, discursive treatises, memorials, and poems and rhapsodies. Because the number of jinshi graduates were so low they acquired great social standing in society. The judicial, arithmetic, and clerical examinations were also held but these graduates only qualified for their specific agencies.

Candidates who passed the exam were not automatically granted office. They still had to pass a quality evaluation by the Ministry of Rites, after which they were allowed to wear official robes.

====Wu Zhou dynasty====
Wu Zetian&#x27;s reign was a pivotal moment for the imperial examination system. The reason for this was because up until that point, the Tang rulers had all been male members of the Li family. Wu Zetian, who officially took the title of emperor in 690, was a woman outside the Li family who needed an alternative base of power. Reform of the imperial examinations featured prominently in her plan to create a new class of elite bureaucrats derived from humbler origins. Both the palace and military examinations were created under Wu Zetian.

In 655, Wu Zetian graduated 44 candidates with the &quot;jìnshì&quot; degree (), and during one seven-year period the annual average of exam takers graduated with a &quot;jinshi&quot; degree was greater than 58 persons per year. Wu lavished favors on the newly graduated &quot;jinshi&quot; degree-holders, increasing the prestige associated with this path of attaining a government career, and clearly began a process of opening up opportunities to success for a wider population pool, including inhabitants of China&#x27;s less prestigious southeast area. Wu Zetian&#x27;s government further expanded the civil service examination system by allowing certain commoners and gentry previously disqualified by their non-elite backgrounds to take the tests. Most of the Li family supporters were located to the northwest, particularly around the capital city of Chang&#x27;an. Wu&#x27;s progressive accumulation of political power through enhancement of the examination system involved attaining the allegiance of previously under-represented regions, alleviating frustrations of the literati, and encouraging education in various locales so even people in the remote corners of the empire would study to pass the imperial exams. These degree holders would then become a new nucleus of elite bureaucrats around which the government could center itself.

In 681, a fill in the blank test based on knowledge of the Confucian classics was introduced.

Examples of officials whom she recruited through her reformed examination system include Zhang Yue, Li Jiao, and Shen Quanqi.

From 702 onward, the names of examinees were hidden to prevent examiners from knowing who was tested. Prior to this, it was even a custom for candidates to present their examiner with their own literary works in order to impress him.

====Tang restoration====

Sometime between 730 and 740, after the Tang restoration, a section requiring the composition of original poetry (including both &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;fu&quot;) was added to the tests, with rather specific set requirements: this was for the &quot;jinshi&quot; degree, as well as certain other tests. The less-esteemed examinations tested for skills such as mathematics, law, and calligraphy. The success rate on these tests of knowledge on the classics was between 10 and 20 percent, but for the thousand or more candidates going for a &quot;jinshi&quot; degree each year in which it was offered, the success rate for the examinees was only between 1 and 2 percent: a total of 6504 &quot;jinshi&quot; were created during course of the Tang dynasty (an average of only about 23 &quot;jinshi&quot; awarded per year). After 755, up to 15 percent of civil service officials were recruited through the examinations.

During the early years of the Tang restoration, the following emperors expanded on Wu&#x27;s policies since they found them politically useful, and the annual averages of degrees conferred continued to rise. This led to the formation of new court factions consisting of examiners and their graduates. With the upheavals which later developed and the disintegration of the Tang empire into the &quot;Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period&quot;, the examination system gave ground to other traditional routes to government positions and favoritism in grading reduced the opportunities of examinees who lacked political patronage. Ironically this period of fragmentation resulted in the utter destruction of old networks established by elite families that had ruled China throughout its various dynasties since its conception. With the disappearance of the old aristocracy, Wu&#x27;s system of bureaucrat recruitment once more became the dominant model in China, and eventually coalesced into the class of nonhereditary elites who would become known to the West as &quot;mandarins&quot;, in reference to Mandarin, the dialect of Chinese employed in the imperial court.

===Song dynasty (960–1279)===
In the Song dynasty (960–1279), the imperial examinations became the primary method of recruitment for official posts. More than a hundred palace examinations were held during the dynasty, resulting in a greater number of &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees rewarded. The examinations were opened to adult Chinese males, with some restrictions, including even individuals from the occupied northern territories of the Liao and Jin dynasties. Figures given for the number of examinees record 70–80,000 in 1088 and 79,000 at the turn of the 12th century. In the mid-11th century, between 5,000 and 10,000 took the metropolitan examinations in a given year. By the mid-12th century, 100,000 candidates registered for the prefectural examinations each year, and by the mid-13th century, more than 400,000. The number of active jinshi degree holders ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 between the 11th and 13th centuries, representing 7,085 of 18,700 posts in 1046 and 8,260 of 38,870 posts in 1213. Statistics indicate that the Song imperial government degree-awards eventually more than doubled the highest annual averages of those awarded during the Tang dynasty, with 200 or more per year on average being common, and at times reaching a per annum figure of almost 240.

The examination hierarchy was formally divided into prefectural, metropolitan, and palace examinations. The prefectural examination was held on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month. Graduates of the prefectural examination were then sent to the capital for metropolitan examination, which took place in Spring, but had no fixed date. Graduates of the metropolitan examination were then sent to the palace examination.

Many individuals of low social status were able to rise to political prominence through success in the imperial examination. According to studies of degree-holders in the years 1148 and 1256, approximately 57 percent originated from families without a father, grandfather, or great-grandfather who had held official rank. However most did have some sort of relative in the bureaucracy. Prominent officials who went through the imperial examinations include Wang Anshi, who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical, and Zhu Xi (1130–1200), whose interpretations of the Four Classics became the orthodox Neo-Confucianism which dominated later dynasties. Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were Su Shi (1037–1101) and his brother Su Zhe (1039–1112): both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi. The process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly, requiring time to spare and tutors. Most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning scholar-official class.

Since 937, by the decision of the Emperor Taizu of Song, the palace examination was supervised by the emperor himself. In 992, the practice of anonymous submission of papers during the palace examination was introduced; it was spread to the departmental examinations in 1007, and to the prefectural level in 1032. Starting in 1037, it was forbidden for examiners to supervise examinations in their home prefecture. Examiners and high officials were also forbidden from contacting each other prior to the exams. The practice of recopying papers in order to prevent revealing the candidate&#x27;s calligraphy was introduced at the capital and departmental level in 1015, and in the prefectures in 1037.

In 1009, Emperor Zhenzong of Song (r. 997–1022) introduced quotas on degrees awarded. In 1090, only 40 degrees were awarded to 3,000 candidates in Fuzhou, which meant only one degree would be awarded for every 75 candidates. The quota system became even more stringent in the 13th century when only one percent of candidates were allowed to pass the prefectural examination. Even graduates of the lowest tier of examinations represented an elite class.

In 1071, Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085) abolished the classicist as well as various other examinations on law and arithmetics. The jinshi examination became the primary gateway to officialdom. Judicial and classicist examinations were revived shortly after. However the judicial examination was classified as a special examination and not many people took the classicist examination. The oral version of the classicist exam was abolished. Other special examinations for household and family member of officials, Minister of Personnel, and subjects such as history as applied to current affairs (&quot;shiwu ce&quot;, Policy Questions), translation, and judicial matters were also administered by the state. Policy Questions became an essential part of following examinations. An exam called the &quot;cewen&quot; which focused on contemporary matters such as politics, economics, and military affairs was introduced.

Various reforms or attempts to reform the examination system were made during the Song dynasty by individuals such as Fan Zhongyan, Zhu Xi, and by Wang Anshi. Wang and Zhu successfully argued that poems and rhapsodies should be excluded from the examinations because they were of no use to administration or cultivation of virtue. The poetry section of the examination was removed in the 1060s. Fan&#x27;s memorial to the throne initiated a process which lead to major educational reform through the establishment of a comprehensive public school system.

===Liao dynasty (916–1125)===
The Khitans who ruled the Liao dynasty only held imperial examinations for regions with large Han populations. The Liao examinations focused on lyric-meter poetry and rhapsodies. The Khitans themselves did not take the exams until 1115 when it became an acceptable avenue for advancing their careers.

===Jin dynasty (1115–1234)===
The Jurchens of the Jin dynasty held two separate examinations to accommodate their former Liao and Song subjects. In the north examinations focused on lyric-meter poetry and rhapsodies while in the south, Confucian Classics were tested. During the reign of Emperor Xizong of Jin (r. 1135–1150), the contents of both examinations were unified and examinees were tested on both genres. Emperor Zhangzong of Jin (r. 1189–1208) abolished the prefectural examinations. Emperor Shizong of Jin (r. 1161–1189) created the first examination conducted in the Jurchen language, with a focus on political writings and poetry. Graduates of the Jurchen examination were called &quot;treatise graduates&quot; (&quot;celun jinshi&quot;) to distinguish them from the regular Chinese jinshi.

===Yuan dynasty (1271–1368)===

Imperial examinations were ceased for a time with the defeat of the Song in 1279 by Kublai Khan and his Yuan dynasty. One of Kublai&#x27;s main advisers, Liu Bingzhong, submitted a memorial recommending the restoration of the examination system: however, this was not done. Kublai ended the imperial examination system, as he believed that Confucian learning was not needed for government jobs. Also, Kublai was opposed to such a commitment to the Chinese language and to the ethnic Han scholars who were so adept at it, as well as its accompanying ideology: he wished to appoint his own people without relying on an apparatus inherited from a newly conquered and sometimes rebellious country. The discontinuation of the exams had the effect of reducing the prestige of traditional learning, reducing the motivation for doing so, as well as encouraging new literary directions not motivated by the old means of literary development and success.

The examination system was revived in 1315, with significant changes, during the reign of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan. The new examination system organized its examinees into regional categories in a way which favored Mongols and severely disadvantaged Southern Chinese. A quota system both for number of candidates and degrees awarded was instituted based on the classification of the four groups, those being the Mongols, their non-Han allies (Semu-ren), Northern Chinese, and Southern Chinese, with further restrictions by province favoring the northeast of the empire (Mongolia) and its vicinities. A quota of 300 persons was fixed for provincial examinations with 75 persons from each group. The metropolitan exam had a quota of 100 persons with 25 persons from each group. Candidates were enrolled on two lists with the Mongols and Semu-ren located on the left and the Northern and Southern Chinese on the right. Examinations were written in Chinese and based on Confucian and Neo-Confucian texts but the Mongols and Semu-ren received easier questions to answer than the Han. Successful candidates were awarded one of three ranks. All graduates were eligible for official appointment.

Under the revised system, the yearly averages for examination degrees awarded was about 21. The way in which the four regional racial categories were divided tended to favor the Mongols, Semu-ren, and North Chinese, despite the South Chinese being by far the largest portion of the population. The 1290 census figures record some 12,000,000 households (about 48% of the total Yuan population) for South China, versus 2,000,000 North Chinese households, and the populations of Mongols and Semu-ren were both less. While South China was technically allotted 75 candidates for each provincial exam, only 28 Han Chinese from South China were included among the 300 candidates, the rest of the South China slots (47) being occupied by resident Mongols or Semu-ren, although 47 &quot;racial South Chinese&quot; who were not residents of South China were approved as candidates.

===Ming dynasty (1368–1644)===
The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) retained and expanded the system it inherited. The Hongwu Emperor was initially reluctant to restart the examinations, considering their curriculum to be lacking in practical knowledge. In 1370 he declared that the exams would follow the Neo-Confucian canon put forth by Zhu Xi in the Song dynasty: the Four Books, discourses, and political analysis. Then he abolished the examinations two years later because he preferred appointment by referral. In 1384, the examinations were revived again, however in addition to the Neo-Confucian canon, Hongwu added another portion to the exams to be taken by successful candidates five days after the first exam. These new exams emphasized &quot;shixue&quot; (practical learning), including subjects such as law, mathematics, calligraphy, horse riding, and archery. The emperor was particularly adamant about the inclusion of archery, and for a few days after issuing the edict, he personally commanded the Guozijian and county-level schools to practice it diligently. As a result of the new focus on practical learning, from 1384 to 1756/57, all provincial and metropolitan examinations incorporated material on legal knowledge and the palace examinations included policy questions on current affairs. The first palace examination of the Ming dynasty was held in 1385.

Provincial and metropolitan exams were organized in three sessions. The first session consisted of three questions on the examinee&#x27;s interpretation of the Four Books, and four on the Classics corpus. The second session took place three days later, and consisted of a discursive essay, five critical judgments, and one in the style of an edict, an announcement and a memorial. Three days after that, the third session was held, consisting of five essays on the Classics, historiography, and contemporary affairs. The palace exam was just one session, consisting of questions on critical matters in the Classics or current affairs. Written answers were expected to follow a predefined structure called the eight-legged essay, which consisted of eight parts: opening, amplification, preliminary exposition, initial argument, central argument, latter argument, final argument, and conclusion. The length of the essay ranged between 550 and 700 characters. Gu Yanwu considered the eight-legged essay to be worse than the book burning of Qin Shi Huang and his burying alive of 460 Confucian scholars.

The Hanlin Academy played a central role in the careers of examination graduates during the Ming dynasty. Graduates of the metropolitan exam with honors were directly appointed senior compilers in the Hanlin Academy. Regular metropolitan exam graduates were appointed junior compilers or examining editors. In 1458, appointment in the Hanlin Academy and the Grand Secretariat was restricted to &quot;jinshi&quot; graduates. Posts such as minister or vice minister of rites or right vice minister of personnel were also restricted to &quot;jinshi&quot; graduates. The training &quot;jinshi&quot; graduates underwent in the Hanlin Academy allowed them insight into a wide range of central government agencies. Ninety percent of Grand Chancellors during the Ming dynasty were &quot;jinshi&quot; degree holders.

The Neo-Confucian orthodoxy became the new guideline for literati learning, narrowing the way in which they could politically and socially interpret the Confucian canon. At the same time, commercialization of the economy and booming population growth resulted in an inflation of the number of degree candidates at the lower levels. The Ming bureaucracy did not increase degree quotas in proportion to the increased population. Near the end of the Ming dynasty, in 1600, there were roughly 500,000 shengyuan in a population of 150 million, that is, one per 300 people. This trend of booming population but artificial limitation of degrees awarded continued into the Qing dynasty, when during the mid-19th century, the ratio of shengyuan to population had shrunk to one per each thousand people. Access to government office became not only extremely difficult, but officials also became more orthodox in their thinking. The higher and more prestigious offices were still dominated by &quot;jinshi&quot; degree-holders, similar to the Song dynasty, but tended to come from elite families.

The social background of metropolitan graduates also narrowed as time went on. In the early years of the Ming dynasty only 14 percent of metropolitan graduates came from families that had a history of providing officials, while in the last years of the Ming roughly 60 percent of metropolitan exam graduates came from established elite families.

===Qing dynasty (1644–1912)===

The ambition of Hong Taiji, the first emperor of the Qing dynasty, was to use the examinations to foster a cadre of Manchu Bannermen who were both martial and literate to administer the government. He initiated the first exam for bannermen in 1638, offered in both Manchu and Chinese, even before his troops took Beijing in 1644. But the Manchu bannermen had no time or money to prepare for the exams, especially since they could gain advancement on the battlefield, and the dynasty went on to rely on both Manchu and Han Chinese officials chosen through the system inherited with minor adaptation from the Ming. During the dynasty a total of 26,747 &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees were earned in 112 examinations held over the 261 years 1644–1905, an average of 238.8 &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees conferred per examination.

Racial quotas were placed on the number of graduates permitted. In the early Qing period, a 4:6 Manchu to Han quota was placed on the palace examination, and was in effect until 1655. Separate examinations were held for bannermen from 1652 to 1655 with a ten-point racial quota of 4:2:4 for Manchus, Mongols, and Han Chinese. In 1651, &quot;translation&quot; examinations were implemented for bannermen, however the purpose of these exams was not to create translators, but to service those Manchus and bannermen who did not understand Classical Chinese. During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1736–1795), Manchus and Mongols were encouraged to take the examinations in Classical Chinese. The translation examination was abolished in 1840 because there were not enough candidates to justify it. After 1723, Han Chinese graduates of the palace examination were required to learn the Manchu language. Bilingualism in Chinese and Manchu languages was favored in the bureaucracy and people who fulfilled the language requirements were given preferential appointments. For example, in 1688, a candidate from Hangzhou who was able to answer policy questions at the palace examination in both Chinese and Manchu was appointed as compiler at the Hanlin Academy, despite finishing bottom of the second tier of jinshi graduates. Ethnic minorities such as the Peng people in Jiangxi Province were given a quota of 1:50 for the shengyuan degree to encourage them to settle down and give up their nomadic way of life. In 1767, a memorial from Guangxi Province noted that some Han Chinese took advantage of the ethnic quotas to become shengyuan and that it was hard to verify who was a native. In 1784, quotas were recommended for Muslims to incorporate them into mainstream society. In 1807, a memorial from Hunan Province requested higher quotas for Miao people so that they would not have to compete with Han Chinese candidates.

Imperial examinations were not immune to corruption, one notable example was the Yangzhou &quot;xiangshi&quot; protests for the juren rank in 1711. When it was found that numerous persons who were sons of the major salt-merchant families had passed the exams, this led the students who failed the exams to accuse the governor-general and the deputy examiner of accepting bribes. Thousands of candidates paraded on the streets and eventually held the director captive. A nine-month long investigation resulted from this and the outcome found the chief examiner and the successful candidates guilty and was subsequently put to death.

====Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1851–1864)====
The Chinese Christian Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was created in rebellion against the Qing dynasty led by a failed examination candidate Hong Xiuquan, which established its capital in Nanjing in 1851. Following the imperial example, the Taipings held exams starting in 1851. They replaced the Confucian Classes, however, with the Taiping Bible, the Old and New Testaments as edited by Hong. Candidates were expected to write eight-legged essays using quotations.

In 1853, women were for the first time in Chinese history able to become examination candidates. Fu Shanxiang took the exam and became the first (and last) female zhuangyuan in Chinese history.

===Decline and abolition===
By the 1830s and 1840s, proposals emerged from officials calling for reforms to the Imperial Examinations to include Western technology. In 1864, Li Hongzhang submitted proposals to add a new subject into the Imperial examinations involving Western technology, that scholars may focus their efforts entirely on this. A similar proposal was tabled by Feng Guifen in 1861 and Ding Richang (mathematics and science) in 1867. In 1872, and again in 1874, Shen Baozhen submitted proposals to the throne for the reform of the imperial examinations to include mathematics. Shen also proposed the abolition of the military examinations, which were based on obsolete weaponry such as archery. He proposed the idea that Tongwen Guan students who performed well in mathematics could be directly appointed to the Zongli Yamen as if they were Imperial examination graduates. Li Hongzhang, in an 1874 memorial, tabled the concept of &quot;Bureaus of Western Learning&quot; (洋学局) in coastal provinces, participation in which was to be accorded the honour of Imperial examination degrees. In 1888, the Imperial examinations was expanded to include the subject of international commerce.

With the military defeats in the 1890s and pressure to develop a national school system, reformers such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao called for abolition of the exams, and the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform of 1898 proposed a set of modernizations. After the Boxer Rebellion, the government drew up plans to reform under the name of New Policies. Reformers memorialized the throne to abolish the system. The key sponsors were Yuan Shikai, Yin Chang, and Zhang Zhidong (Chang Chih-tung). On 2 September 1905, the throne ordered the examination system be discontinued, beginning at the first level in 1905. The new system provided equivalents to the old degrees; a bachelor&#x27;s degree, for instance, would be considered equivalent to the &quot;xiu cai&quot;.

Those who had at least the degree of &quot;shengyuan&quot; remained fairly well off since they retained their social status. Older students who had failed to even become &quot;shengyuan&quot; were more damaged because they could not easily absorb new learning, were too proud to turn to commerce, and too weak for physical labor.

==Impact==
===Transition to scholar-bureaucracy===
The original purpose of the imperial examinations as they were implemented during the Sui dynasty was to strike a blow against the hereditary aristocracy and to centralize power around the emperor. The era preceding the Sui dynasty, the period of Northern and Southern dynasties, was a golden age for the Chinese aristocracy. The power they wielded seriously constrained the emperor&#x27;s ability to exercise his power in court, especially when it came to appointing officials. The Sui emperor created the imperial examinations to bypass and mitigate aristocratic interests. This was the origin of the Chinese examination system.

The short lived Sui dynasty was soon replaced by the Tang, who built on the examination system. The emperor placed the palace exam graduates, the jinshi, in important government posts, where they came into conflict with hereditary elites. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (713–756), about a third of the Grand Chancellors appointed were jinshi, but by the time of Emperor Xianzong of Tang (806–821), three fifths of the Grand Chancellors appointed were jinshi. This change in the way government was organized dealt a real blow to the aristocrats, but they did not sit idly by and wait to become obsolete. Instead they themselves entered the examinations to gain the privileges associated with it. By the end of the dynasty, the aristocratic class had produced 116 jinshi, so that they remained a significant influence in the government. Hereditary privileges were also not completely done away with. The sons of high ministers and great generals had the right to hold minor offices without taking the examinations. This privilege was introduced in 963 and allowed high officials to nominate their sons, nephews, and grandsons for civil service. However, after 1009, nominated candidates also had to study at the Guozijian and after completing a course, sit an examination. More than 50 percent passed. Lower level posts in the capital were awarded to these graduates.

In addition, the number of graduates were not only small, but also formed their own clique in the government based around the examiners and the men they passed. In effect the graduates became another interest group the emperor had to contend with. This problem was greatly mitigated by the increase in candidates and graduates during the Song dynasty, made possible by its robust economy. Since the entire upper echelon of the Song dynasty was filled by jinshi, and imperial clan members were barred from posts of substance, there was no longer any conflict of the type relating to different preparatory backgrounds. Efforts were made to break the link between examiner and examinee, removing another factor contributing to the formation of scholar bureaucrat cliques. While the influence of certain scholar officials never disappeared, they no longer held any influence in organizing men.

The scholar-bureaucrats, later known as Mandarins in the West, continued to exert significant influence throughout the rest of Chinese imperial history. The relationship between the emperor and his officials as seen from the side of the officials is encapsulated by Zhang Fangping&#x27;s statement to Emperor Renzong of Song in the 1040s: &quot;The empire cannot be ruled by Your Majesty alone; the empire can only be governed by Your Majesty collaborating with the officials.&quot; In 1071, Emperor Shenzong of Song remarked that Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies were for the benefit of the people and not the &quot;shidafu&quot;, the elite literate class. His grand chancellor, Wen Yanbo, retorted, &quot;You govern the nation with &quot;us&quot;, the officials, not with the people.&quot;

The importance of clan identity as the chief marker of status seems to have declined by the 9th century, when the genealogical section of epitaphs excluded choronyms (combination of clan and place names) in favor of office titles. For the aristocracy, although status was still an important factor in marriage, wealth had become far more important by the time of the Southern Song (1127–1279) than the Tang era. During the Yuanyou era (1086–1093), it was reported that an imperial clanswoman had married a man surnamed Liu from the foreign quarter of Guangzhou. In 1137, a complaint was lodged against a military official for marrying his sister to the &quot;great merchant&quot; Pu Yali (a two-time envoy from Arabia). The foreign merchant family of Pu also sought marriage into the imperial clan.

===Subordination of the military===
Although there was a military version of the exam, it was neglected by the government. The importance of the regular imperial examinations in governance had the effect of subordinating the military to civil government. By the time of the Song dynasty, the two highest military posts of Minister of War and Chief of Staff were both reserved for civil servants. It became routine for civil officials to be appointed as front-line commanders in the army. The highest rank for a dedicated military career was reduced to unit commander. To further reduce the influence of military leaders, they were routinely reassigned at the end of a campaign, so that no lasting bond occurred between commander and soldier. The policy of appointing civil officials as ad hoc military leaders was maintained by both the Ming and Qing dynasties after the initial phase of conquest. Successful commanders entrenched solely in the military tradition such as Yue Fei were viewed with distrust and apprehension. He was eventually executed by the Song government despite successfully leading Song forces against the Jin dynasty. It is possible that foreigners also looked down on Chinese military men in contrast to their civil counterparts. In 1042, the general Fan Zhongyan refused a military title because he thought it would demean him in the eyes of the Tibetans and Tanguts. Although it negatively impacted the military&#x27;s performance at times, the new relationship between the civil and military sectors of the government avoided the endemic military coups of preceding dynasties for the rest of imperial Chinese history.

===Education===
During the Tang period, a set curricular schedule took shape where the three steps of reading, writing, and the composition of texts had to be learnt before students could enter state academies. As the number of graduates increased, competition for government posts became more fierce. Whereas at the beginning of the Tang dynasty, there were few jinshi, during the Song dynasty, there were more than the government needed. Several reforms to education were suggested to thin the number of candidates and improve their quality. In 1044, Han Qi, Fan Zhongyan, Ouyang Xiu, and Song Qi implemented the Qingli Reforms, which included hiring experts in the classics to teach at government schools, setting up schools in every prefecture, and requiring every candidate to have attended the prefectural school for at least 300 days to qualify for the prefectural exam. Prior to the Qingli Reforms, the role of the state was limited to supporting a few institutions, such as in 1022 when the government granted a prefectural school in Yanzhou with 151 acres of land. Some of the reformers directly participated in the creation of schools. Between 1035 and 1046, Fan Zhongyan and his followers set up 16 schools. Ouyang Xiu donated 1.5 million cash for the construction of a school in his home prefecture. Han Qi did the same as well. The Qingli Reforms were abandoned after only one year.

While the Qingli Reforms failed, the ideal of a statewide education system was taken up by Wang Anshi (1021–1086), who proposed as part of his New Policies that examinations alone were not enough to select talent. His answer to the glut of graduates was to found new schools (&quot;shuyuan&quot;) for the selection of officials, with the ultimate goal of replacing the examinations altogether by selecting officials directly from the school&#x27;s students. An alternative path to office was introduced: the Three Hall system. The government expanded the Taixue (National University) and ordered each circuit to grant land to schools and to hire supervising teachers for them. In 1076, a special examination for teachers was introduced. Implementation of the reforms was uneven and slow. Of the 320 prefectures, only 53 had prefectural schools with supervising teachers by 1078 and only a few were given the ordered allotment of land. Wang died and his reforms languished until the early 12th century when Emperor Huizong of Song injected more resources into the national education project. In 1102, Huizong and his chief councilor Cai Jing (1046–1126) decided to combine schools and examinations and make schools the focus of both education and recruitment. In 1103, the Taixue grew to 3,800 students with 200 in the upper hall, 600 in the lower hall, and 3,000 in the Biyong or outer hall. In 1104, students started being processed up the three-colleges (Three Hall) ranking system from the county school to the Taixue for direct appointment in the bureaucracy. In 1106, the &quot;eight virtues&quot; method of selection was introduced. The &quot;eight virtues&quot; method was to select and promote students based on eight varieties of virtuous conduct. By 1109, schools had received more than 100,000 &quot;jing&quot; of land (1.5 million acres), taken from the state granaries. Total student numbers were reported at 210,000 in 1104, 167,622 in 1109, and over 200,000 in 1116. At its height the Song education system included approximately 0.2% of its one hundred million people.

The new education policies were sometimes criticized and the importance of schools attacked. Su Shi believed that educational institutions were nothing more than places for students to learn the necessary techniques to pass the imperial exams. Liu Ban (1023–1089) believed that an education at home was sufficient: &quot;Education that scholars receive at home is sufficient for them to become talented people. Why do they need to turn to teachers in government schools to do so?&quot; In 1078, a student of the Taixue, Yu Fan, submitted a memorial accusing the instructors of bias and improper teaching. In the following year, Emperor Shenzong of Song confirmed the accusations after a Censorate investigation. In 1112, a memorial criticized the prefectural and county schools for a variety of abuses. It accused the local supervisors of not understanding the goal of educating greater talent, wasting funds by buying excess food and drink, buying superfluous decorations, profiting by selling grain at market price, borrowing from students, and engaging in acts of violence towards officials. The &quot;eight virtues&quot; system received many complaints about its lack of academic rigor. In 1121, the local three-colleges system was dismantled and the local schools ordered to return land to the government.

The schools went into further decline starting from the Southern Song period (1127–1279) after the loss of the north to the Jin dynasty. The government was reluctant to fund them because they did not create immediate profits and as a result, cuts were made in teaching personnel, and the national university itself was reduced in size. The exception to this was in the 1140s when the court played an active role in reconstructing schools and made efforts to staff them with degree-holders. After this period, government involvement in state educational institutions ceased. According to contemporary complaints about the schools, they deteriorated in quality, were subjected to a variety of abuses and heterodox teaching, no teaching at all, and decline in revenue. Schools in imperial China never recovered from the decline starting from the Southern Song. For the rest of China&#x27;s dynastic history, government funded academies functioned primarily as gateways to the examination system, and did not offer any real instruction to students. Functionally they were not schools but rather preparatory institutions for the examinations. Wang&#x27;s goal of replacing the examinations was never realized. Although Wang&#x27;s reforms fell short of their mark, they launched the first state led initiative to regulate the day to day education of its subjects through the appointment of teachers and funding of schools.

Primary education was relegated to private schools founded by kinship clusters during the Ming dynasty, although private teachers for individual households remained popular. Some schools were charity projects of the imperial government. The government also funded specialized schools for each of the Eight Banners to teach the Manchu language and Chinese. None of these institutions had a standardized curriculum or age of admission.

===Surplus graduates===
The problem of surplus graduates became especially acute starting from the 18th century. Due to the long period of peace established by the Qing dynasty, a large number of candidates were able to make significant progress in their studies and apply for the exams. Their papers were all of similar quality so that examiners found it difficult to differentiate them and make their selections. Officials began to think of new ways to eliminate candidates rather than how to select the best scholars. A complicated set of formal requirements for the examinations was created which undermined the whole system.

===Failed candidates===

Inevitably a large number of candidates failed the exams, often repeatedly. During the Tang period, the ratio of success to failure in the palace exam was 1:100 or 2:100. In the Song dynasty, the ratio of success to failure for the metropolitan exam was about 1:50. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, success to failure for the provincial exam was about 1:100. For every shengyuan in the country, only one in three thousand would ever become a jinshi. While most candidates were men of certain means, those from poor families risked everything on passing the exams. Ambitious and talented candidates who suffered repeated failures felt the bite of indignation, and failure escalated from disappointment to desperation, and sometimes even revolt.

Huang Chao led a massive rebellion in the late Tang dynasty, after it had already been weakened by the An Lushan rebellion. He was born to a wealthy family in western Shandong. After repeated failures he created a secret society that engaged in illicit salt trading. Although Huang Chao&#x27;s rebellion was ultimately defeated, it led to the final disintegration of the Tang dynasty. Among Huang Chao&#x27;s cohort were other failed candidates such as Li Zhen, who targeted government officials, killed them and threw their bodies into the Yellow River. Zhang Yuanhao of the Northern Song defected to Western Xia after failing the examinations. He aided the Tanguts in setting up a Chinese-style court. Niu Jinxing of the late Ming was a general in Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebel army. Having failed to become a jinshi, he targeted high officials and members of the royal family, butchering them as retribution. Hong Xiuquan led the mid-19th-century Taiping Rebellion against the Qing dynasty. After his fourth and final attempt at the shengyuan exam, he had a nervous breakdown, during which he had visions of a heaven where he was part of a celestial family. Influenced by the teachings of Christian missionaries, Hong announced to his family and followers that his visions had been of God, his father, and Jesus Christ, his brother. He created the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and waged war on the Qing dynasty, devastating parts of southeast China which would not recover for decades.

Pu Songling (1640–1715) failed the examination multiple times. He immortalized the frustrations of candidates trapped in the relentless system in numerous stories that parodied the system.

===General discussion of late imperial system===
Reformers charged that the set format of the &quot;eight-legged essay&quot; stifled original thought and satirists portrayed the rigidity of the system in novels such as &quot;The Scholars&quot;. In the twentieth century, the New Culture Movement portrayed the examination system as a cause for China&#x27;s weakness in such stories as Lu Xun&#x27;s &quot;Kong Yiji&quot;. Some have suggested that limiting the topics prescribed in examination system removed the incentives for Chinese intellectuals to learn mathematics or to conduct experimentation, perhaps contributing to the Great Divergence, in which China&#x27;s scientific and economic development fell behind Europe.

However, the political and ethical theories of Confucian classical curriculum have also been likened to the classical studies of humanism in European nations which proved instrumental in selecting an &quot;all-rounded&quot; top-level leadership. British and French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on Greco-Roman classical subjects and general cultural studies, as well as assessing personal physique and character. US leaders included &quot;virtue&quot; such as reputation and support for the US constitution as a criterion for government service. These features have been compared to similar aspects of the earlier Chinese model. In the British civil service, just as it was in China, entrance to the civil service was usually based on a general education in ancient classics, which similarly gave bureaucrats greater prestige. The Oxbridge ideal of the civil service was identical to the Confucian ideal of a general education in world affairs through humanism. Well into the 20th century, classics, literature, history and language remained heavily favoured in British civil service examinations. In the period between 1925 and 1935, 67 percent of British civil service entrants consisted of such graduates.

In late imperial China, the examination system was the primary mechanism by which the central government captured and held the loyalty of local-level elites. Their loyalty, in turn, ensured the integration of the Chinese state, and countered tendencies toward regional autonomy and the breakup of the centralized system. The examination system distributed its prizes according to provincial and prefectural quotas, which meant that imperial officials were recruited from the whole country, in numbers roughly proportional to each province&#x27;s population. Elite individuals all over China, even in the disadvantaged peripheral regions, had a chance at succeeding in the examinations and achieving the rewards and emoluments office brought.

The examination-based civil service thus promoted stability and social mobility. The Confucianism-based examinations meant that the local elites and ambitious would-be members of those elites across the whole of China were taught with similar values. Even though only a small fraction (about 5 percent) of those who attempted the examinations actually passed them and even fewer received titles, the hope of eventual success sustained their commitment. Those who failed to pass did not lose wealth or local social standing; as dedicated believers in Confucian orthodoxy, they served, without the benefit of state appointments, as civilian teachers, patrons of the arts, and managers of local projects, such as irrigation works, schools, or charitable foundations.

==Taking the exams==

===Requirements===

During the Tang dynasty, candidates were either recommended by their schools or had to register for exams at their home prefecture. By the Song dynasty, theoretically all adult Chinese men were eligible for the examinations. The only requirement was education.

In practice, a number of official and unofficial restrictions applied to who was able to take the imperial exams. The commoners were divided into four groups according to occupation: scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Beneath the common people were the so-called &quot;mean&quot; people such as boat-people, beggars, sex-workers, entertainers, slaves, and low-level government employees. Among the forms of discrimination faced by the &quot;mean&quot; people were restriction from government office and the credential to take the imperial exam. Certain ethnic groups or castes such as the &quot;degraded&quot; Jin dynasty outcasts in Ningbo, around 3,000 people, were barred from taking the imperial exams as well. Women were excluded from taking the exams. Butchers and sorcerers were also excluded at times. Merchants were restricted from taking the exams until the Ming and Qing dynasties, although as early as 955, the scholar-officials themselves were involved in trading activities. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, artisans were also restricted from official service. During the Song dynasty, artisans, merchants, clerks, and Buddhist and Taoist priests were specifically excluded from the &quot;jinshi&quot; exam; and, in the Liao dynasty, physicians, diviners, butchers, and merchants were all prohibited from taking the examinations, citing &quot;Liao-shih&quot;. At times, quota systems were also used to restrict the number of candidates allowed to take or to pass the imperial civil service examinations, by region or by other criteria.

Aside from official restrictions, there was also the economic problem faced by men of poorer means. The route to a jinshi degree was long and the competition fierce. Men who achieved a jinshi degree in their twenties were considered extremely fortunate. Someone who obtained a jinshi degree in their thirties, the average age of jinshi candidates, was also considered on schedule. Both were expected to study continuously for years without interruption. Without the necessary financial support, studying for the exams would have been an impractical task. After completing their studies, candidates also had to pay for travel and lodging expenses, not to mention thank-you gifts for the examiners and tips for the staff. A jinshi candidate required someone in the bureaucracy to act as his patron to vouch for his integrity. Banquets and entertainment also had to be paid for. As a result of these expenses, the nurturing of a candidate was a common burden for the whole family.

===Procedures===

Each candidate arrived at an examination compound with only a few amenities: a water pitcher, a chamber pot, bedding, food (prepared by the examinee), an inkstone, ink and brushes. Guards verified a student&#x27;s identity and searched him for hidden texts such as cheat sheets. The facilities provided for the examinee consisted of an isolated room or cell with a makeshift bed, desk, and bench. Each examinee was assigned to a cell according to a pre-determined system numbered by the Heavenly stems and Earthly branches. Paper was provided by the examiners and stamped with an official seal. The examinees of the Ming and Qing periods could take up to three days and two nights writing &quot;eight-legged essays&quot;—literary compositions with eight distinct sections. Interruptions and outside communication were forbidden for the duration of the exam. If a candidate died, officials wrapped his body in a straw mat and tossed it over the high walls that ringed the compound.

At the end of the examination, answer sheets were processed by the sealing office. The Ming-era &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot; () contains an entire section of stories about &quot;Corruption in Education&quot;, most of which involve swindlers exploiting exam-takers&#x27; desperate attempts to bribe the examiner. Exact quotes from the classics were required; misquoting even one character or writing it in the wrong form meant failure, so candidates went to great lengths to bring hidden copies of these texts with them, sometimes written on their underwear. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts holds an example of a Qing dynasty cheatsheet, a handkerchief with 10,000 characters of Confucian classics in microscopically small handwriting.

To prevent cheating, the sealing office erased any information about the candidate found on the paper and assigned a number to each candidate&#x27;s papers. Persons in the copy office then recopied the entire text three times so that the examiners would not be able to identify the author. The first review was carried out by an examining official, and the papers were then handed over to a secondary examining official and to an examiner, either the chief examiner or one of several vice examiners. Judgments by the first and second examining official were checked again by a determining official, who fixed the final grade. Working with the team of examiners were a legion of gate supervisors, registrars, sealers, copyists and specialist assessors of literature.

Pu Songling, a Qing dynasty satirist, described the &quot;seven transformations of the candidate&quot;:

===Ceremonies===
The middle of the stairs of the main hall of the imperial palace during the Tang and Song dynasties were carved with an image of the mythical turtle Ao (). When the list of successful candidates of the palace examination was published, all the names of the graduates were read aloud in the presence of the emperor, and recorded in the archival documents of the dynasty. Graduates were given a green gown, a tablet as a symbol of status, and boots. The first ranked scholar received the title of Zhuàngyuán () and stood in the middle of the stairs on the carving of Ao. This gave rise to the phrase &quot;to have seized Ao&#x27;s head&quot; ( &quot;zhàn ào tóu&quot;), or &quot;to have alone seized Ao&#x27;s head&quot; ( &quot;dú zhàn àotóu&quot;) to describe a Zhuàngyuán, and more generally to refer to someone who excels in a certain field.

===Privileges===
&quot;Shengyuan&quot; degree holders were given some general tax exemptions. Metropolitan exam graduates were allowed to buy themselves free of exile in cases of crime and to decrease the number of blows with the stick for a fee. Other than the title of jinshi, graduates of the palace examination were also exempted from all taxes and corvée labour.

==Post-examination appointments==


Graduates of the prefectural examination qualified for employment as teachers in local or family schools, as administrators of granaries or temples, and as subofficial local administrators. The top three graduates of the palace examinations were directly appointed to the Hanlin Academy. Lower ranked graduates could be appointed to offices like Hanlin bachelor, secretaries, messengers in the Ministry of Rites, case reviewers, erudites, prefectural judges, prefects or county magistrates (zhixian ).

During the Tang dynasty, successful candidates reported to the Ministry of Personnel for placement examinations. Unassigned officials and honorary title holders were expected to take placement examinations at regular intervals. Non-assigned status could last a very long time especially when waiting for a substantive appointment. After being assigned to office, a junior official was given an annual merit rating. There was no specified term limit, but most junior officials served for at least three years or more in one post. Senior officials served indefinitely at the pleasure of the emperor.

In the Song dynasty, successful candidates were appointed to office almost immediately and waiting periods between appointments were not long. Between 60 and 80 percent of the civil service was composed of low-ranking officials. They all started their careers in counties not in their home prefecture. These assignments lasted three to four years before they were reassigned to another locality and position. Annual merit ratings were still taken but officials could request evaluation for reassignment. Officials who wished to escape harsh assignments often requested reassignment as a state supervisor of a Taoist temple or monastery. Senior officials in the capital also sometimes nominated themselves for the position of prefect in obscure prefectures.

Recruitment by examination during the Yuan dynasty constituted a very minor part of the Yuan administration. Hereditary Mongol nobility formed the elite nucleus of the government. Initially the Mongols drew administrators from their subjects. In 1261, Kublai Khan ordered the establishment of Mongolian schools to draw officials from. The School for the Sons of the State was established in 1271 to give two or three years of training for the sons of the Imperial Bodyguards so that they might become suitable for official recruitment.

Recruitment by examination flourished after 1384 in the Ming dynasty. Provincial graduates were sometimes appointed to low-ranking offices or entered the Guozijian for further training, after which they might be considered for better appointments. Before appointment to office, metropolitan graduates were assigned to observe the functions of an office for up to one year. The maximum tenure for an office was nine years, but triennial evaluations were also taken, at which point an official could be reassigned. Magistrates of districts submitted monthly evaluation reports to their prefects and the prefects submitted annual evaluations to provincial authorities. Every third year, provincial authorities submitted evaluations to the central government, at which point an &quot;outer evaluation&quot; was conducted, requiring local administration to send representatives to attend a grand audience at the capital. Officials at the capital conducted an evaluation every six years. Capital officials of rank 4 and above were exempted from regular evaluations. Irregular evaluations were conducted by censorial officials.

Graduates of the metropolitan examination during the Qing dynasty were assured influential posts in the officialdom. The Ministry of Personnel submitted a list of nominees to the emperor, who then decided all major appointments in the capital and in the provinces in consultation with the Grand Council. Appointments were generally on a three-year basis with an evaluation at the end and the option for renewal. Officials rank three and above were personally evaluated by the emperor. Due to a population boom in the early modern era, qualified men far exceeded vacancies in the bureaucracy so that many waited for years between active duty assignments. Purchase of office became a common practice during the 19th century since it was very hard for qualified men to be appointed to one of the very limited number of posts. Even receiving empty titles with no active assignment required a monetary contribution.

==Institutions==

===Ministry of Rites===
The Ministry of Rites, under the Department of State Affairs, was responsible for organizing and carrying out the imperial examinations.

===Hanlin Academy===
The Hanlin Academy was an institution created during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (r. 712–755). It was located directly in the palace compound and staffed by officials who drafted official documents such as edicts. These officials, commonly appointed from the top three ranks of the palace examination graduates, came to be known as academicians (&quot;xueshi&quot;) after 738, when a new building was constructed to provide them living quarters. The title &quot;academician&quot; was not only for the staff of the Hanlin Academy, but any special assignment to special posts. The number of academicians in the Hanlin Academy was fixed to six at a later date and they were given the task of doing paperwork and consulting the emperor. The Hanlin Academy drafted documents about the appointment and dismissal of high ministers, proclamation of amnesties, and imperial military commands. It also aided the emperor in reading documents.

The number of Hanlin academicians was reduced to two during the Song dynasty. During the Yuan dynasty, a Hanlin Academy just for Mongols was created to translate documents. More emphasis was put on the oversight of imperial publications such as dynastic histories.

In the Qing dynasty, the number of posts in the Hanlin Academy increased immensely and a Manchu official was installed at all times. The posts became purely honorary and the institution was reduced to just another stepping stone for persons seeking higher positions in the government. Lower officials in the Hanlin Academy often had other posts at the same time.

===Taixue===
The Taixue (&quot;National University&quot;), was the highest educational institution in imperial China. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC), Confucianism was adopted as the state doctrine. The Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu suggested establishing a National University (&quot;Taixue&quot;) in the capital, Chang&#x27;an, so that erudites could teach the Classics. Teaching at the Taixue was a prestigious job because the emperor commonly picked from among them for appointment in high offices. At first the Taixue had only 50 students but increased to around 3,000 by the end of the millennium. Under the reign of Wang Mang (r. 9–23 AD), two other educational institutions called the Biyong and Mingtang were established south of the city walls, each able to house 10,000 students. The professors and students were able to exercise some political power by criticizing their opponents such as governors and eunuchs. This eventually led to the arrest of more than 1,000 professors and students by the eunuchs.

After the collapse of the Han dynasty, the Taixue was reduced to just 19 teaching positions and 1,000 students but climbed back to 7,000 students under the Jin dynasty (266–420). After the nine rank system was introduced, a &quot;Directorate of Education&quot; (&quot;Guozijian&quot;) was created for persons rank five and above, effectively making it the educational institution for nobles, while the Taixue was relegated to teaching commoners. Over the next two centuries, the Guozijian became the primary educational institute in the Southern Dynasties. The Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern Dynasties also created their own schools but they were only available for sons and relatives of high officials. The Northern Wei dynasty founded the Primary School of Four Gates.

During the Sui dynasty, a Law School, Arithmetics School, and Calligraphy School were put under the administration of the Guozijian. These schools accepted the relatives of officials rank eight and below while the Taixue, Guozijian, and Four Gates School served higher ranks. By the start of the Tang dynasty (618–907), 300 students were enrolled in the Guozijian, 500 at the Taixue, 1,300 at the Four Gates School, 50 at the Law School, and a mere 30 at the Calligraphy and Arithmetics Schools. Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649–683), founded a second Guozijian in Luoyang. The average age of admission was 14 to 19 but 18 to 25 for the Law School. Students of these institutions who applied for the state examinations had their names transmitted to the Ministry of Rites, which was also responsible for their appointment to a government post.

During the Song dynasty, Emperor Renzong of Song founded a new Taixue at Kaifeng with 200 students enrolled. Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085) raised the number of students to 2,400. He also implemented the &quot;three-colleges law&quot; (&quot;sanshefa&quot; 三舍法) in 1079, which divided the Taixue into three colleges. Under the three-colleges law, students first attended the Outer College, then the Inner College, and finally the Superior College. One of the aims of the three-colleges was to provide a more balanced education for students and to de-emphasize Confucian learning. Students were taught in only one of the Confucian classics, depending on the college, as well as arithmetics and medicine. Students of the Outer College who passed a public and institutional examination were allowed to enter the Inner College. At the Inner College there were two exams over a two-year period on which the students were graded. Those who achieved the superior grade on both exams were directly appointed to office equal to that of a metropolitan exam graduate. Those who achieved an excellent grade on one exam but slightly worse on the other could still be considered for promotion, and having a good grade in one exam but mediocre in another still awarded merit equal to that of a provincial exam graduate.

In 1104, the prefectural examinations were abolished in favor of the three-colleges system, which required each prefecture to send an annual quota of students to the Taixue. This drew criticism from some officials who claimed that the new system benefited the rich and young, and was less fair because the relatives of officials could enroll without being examined for their skills. In 1121, the local three-college system was abolished but retained at the national level. For a time, the national examination system was also abandoned in favor of directly appointing students of the Taixue to government posts. The Taixue itself did not survive the demise of the Song dynasty and ceased to exist afterwards, becoming a synonym for the Guozijian.

===Guozijian===
The Guozijian (&quot;Directorate of Education&quot;) was founded under Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 265–289) to educate the nobility. Under the Song dynasty, the Guozijian became the central administrative institution for all state schools throughout the empire. Among its duties were the maintenance of the buildings, the construction of new facilities, and the promotion of students. The Guozijian itself was equipped with a library and printing shop to create model printing blocks for distribution. The Guozijian was abolished in 1907.

==Organization==
The examinations were given a formal structure and tier system during the Song dynasty but the exact number of tiers, their titles, degrees awarded, and names differed depending on era and dynasty. Sometimes examinations of the same tier from different dynasties had different names. For example, the palace examination was called &quot;dianshi&quot; or &quot;yushi&quot; during the Song, but &quot;tingshi&quot; in the Ming, while the metropolitan examination was &quot;shengshi&quot; in the Song and &quot;huishi&quot; in the Jin, Yuan, and Ming. In other cases, examinations of different tiers used the same name. &quot;Fushi&quot; in the Liao meant prefectural examination but provincial examination in the Jin. The lowest tier examinations were usually held annually while higher tier examinations held triennially. 

* Entry-level examinations (collectively known as tóngshēngshì () or simply tóngshì (); lit. &quot;child examinations&quot;): held every year locally and accessible to educated individuals from their early teenage years. The examinations were broken down hierarchically into: xiànshì (, lit. &quot;county examination&quot;), fǔshì (, lit. &quot;prefectural examination&quot;) and yuànshì (, lit. &quot;college/academy examination&quot;).
* Provincial examination (called xiāngshì () and fǔshì (); lit. &quot;countryside/hometown examination&quot; and &quot;prefectural examination&quot;): held every three years in provincial capitals.
* Metropolitan examination (called huìshì (), shěngshì () and lǐbùshì (); lit. &quot;metropolitan examination&quot;, &quot;department examination&quot; and &quot;ministry of rites examination&quot;): held every three years in the national capital.
* Palace examination (called diànshì (), yùshì () and tíngshì (); lit. &quot;hall examination&quot;, &quot;imperial/government examination&quot; and &quot;courtyard examination&quot;): held every three years in the imperial palace and often supervised by the emperor himself.

===Degree types===
By the Ming dynasty, the examinations and degrees formed a &quot;ladder of success&quot;, with success generally being equated with graduating as &quot;jinshi&quot;, a degree similar to a modern PhD. Modifications to the basic &quot;jinshi&quot; or other degrees were made for higher-placing graduates, similar to the modern latin honors. The examination process extended down to the county level, and included examinations at the provincial and metropolitan levels. The highest level examination would be at the palace level, with successful candidates being known as &quot;jinshi&quot;. Special purpose exams were occasionally offered by imperial decree.
* Tongsheng (, lit. &quot;child student&quot;), an examinee who had passed the county/prefecture examination of the entry-level examinations.
* Shengyuan (, lit. &quot;student member&quot;), commonly called xiucai (, lit. &quot;outstanding talent&quot;), a scholar who had passed the academy examination of the entry-level examinations. &quot;Xiucai&quot; enjoyed officially sanctioned social privileges such as exemption from statute labour, access into local government facilities and limited immunity against corporal punishments. They were further divided into three classes according to their performance in the examination.
** Linsheng (, lit. &quot;granary student&quot;), the first class of &quot;shengyuan&quot;, who were the best performers in the academy examination, and got to receive government-issued rations and pay for their achievements. The top performers within this class would get accepted into the Imperial Academy as gongsheng (, lit. &quot;tribute/selected student&quot;), and will then sit the provincial examination or even be eligible for the metropolitan examination directly.
*** Anshou (, lit. &quot;first desk&quot;), the highest ranking &quot;linsheng&quot;, and thus the top &quot;shengyuan&quot; who ranked first in the academy examination.
** Zengsheng (, lit. &quot;gained student&quot;), the second class of &quot;shengyuan&quot;, who performed less well than &quot;linsheng&quot; and enjoyed similar legal perks, but not the material rewards.
** Fusheng (, lit. &quot;attached student&quot;), the third class of &quot;shengyuan&quot; and considered substitute recruits outside the official quota of enrollment. They were considered passable examinees but needed more improvements.
* Juren (, lit. &quot;recommended man&quot;), a scholar who passed the triennial provincial examination.
** Jieyuan (, lit. &quot;foremost among present scholars&quot;), the &quot;juren&quot; who ranked first in the provincial examination.
* Gongshi (, lit. &quot;tribute scholar&quot;), a scholar who passed the triennial metropolitan examination.
** Huiyuan (, lit. &quot;top conference examinee&quot;), the &quot;gongshi&quot; who ranked first in the metropolitan examination.
* Jinshi (, lit. &quot;advanced scholar&quot;), a scholar who passed the triennial palace examination.
** Jinshi jidi (, lit. &quot;distinguished advanced scholar&quot;), the first class in the palace examination, usually only the top three individuals were qualified for this title.
*** Zhuangyuan (, lit. &quot;top thesis author&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; who ranked first overall.
*** Bangyan (, lit. &quot;eyes positioned alongside&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; who ranked second overall.
*** Tanhua (, lit. &quot;flower snatcher&quot;), the &quot;jinshi&quot; who ranked third overall.
** Jinshi chushen (, lit. &quot;advanced scholar background&quot;), the second class in the palace examination, ranking immediately after the &quot;tanhua&quot;.
** Tong jinshi chushen (, lit. &quot;along with advanced scholar background&quot;), the third class in the palace examination.

==Other examinations==
===Classicist===
The classicist (&quot;mingjing&quot;) originated as a category for recruitment by local authorities to the appointment of state offices. The term was created during the Han dynasty under Emperor Wu of Han for candidates eligible for official appointment or for enrolment in the Taixue. Classicists were expected to be familiar with the Confucian canon and the Taoist text &quot;Laozi&quot;. The classicist category fell out of use under Cao Wei and the Jin dynasty but was revived during the Southern Dynasties for filling places in the Taixue.

During the Sui dynasty, examinations for classicists and cultivated talents were introduced. Unlike cultivated talents, classicists were only tested on the Confucian canon, which was considered an easy task at the time, so those who passed were awarded posts in the lower rungs of officialdom. Classicists were tested by being presented phrases from the classic texts. They then had to write the whole paragraph to complete the phrase. If the examinee was able to correctly answer five of ten questions, they passed. This was considered such an easy task that a 30-year-old candidate was said to be old for a classicist examinee, but young to be a jinshi. An oral version of the classicist examination known as &quot;moyi&quot; also existed but consisted of 100 questions rather than just ten. In contrast, the jinshi examination tested not only the Confucian classics, but also history, proficiency in compiling official documents, inscriptions, discursive treatises, memorials, and poems and rhapsodies. In 742, Laozi was replaced in the examination by the glossary Erya. In 1071, Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085) abolished the classicist as well as various other examinations on law and arithmetics.

===Cultivated talent===
The cultivated talent (&quot;xiucai&quot;) originated in the Han dynasty when Emperor Wu of Han declared that each province had to present one cultivated talent per year to be appointed in the government. During the Sui dynasty, examinations for &quot;cultivated talents&quot; were introduced. They were tested on matters of statecraft and the Confucian canon. This type of examination was very limited in its implementation and there were only 11 or 12 graduates throughout its entire history. During the Song dynasty, cultivated talent became a general title for graduates of the state examinations.

===Strategic questions===
The strategic questions examination (&quot;cewen&quot;) was a question-and-answer type essay examination introduced during the Han dynasty. The purpose of the exam was to ensure examinees could apply Confucian doctrine to practical matters of statecraft. A question on a problematic political issue was asked and the examinee was expected to answer it according to his own opinion and how the issue could be resolved. The strategic questions examination became obsolete during the Ming dynasty due to the prevalence of the eight-legged essay.

===Military===


During the reign of Wu Zetian the imperial government created military examinations for the selection of army officers as a response to the breakdown of garrison militias known as the Fubing system. The first formal military examinations (武舉 Wǔjǔ) were introduced in 702. The military examinations had the same general arrangement as the regular exams, with provincial, metropolitan and palace versions of the exams. Successful candidates were awarded military versions of Jinshi and Juren degrees: &quot;Wujinshi&quot; () and &quot;Wujuren&quot; (), and so on.

The military exam included both a written and physical portion. In theory, candidates were supposed to master not only the same Confucian texts as required by the civil exam, but also Chinese military texts such as &quot;The Art of War&quot;, in addition to martial skills such as archery and horsemanship. The district exam was conducted by the county magistrate and consisted of three sessions.

The first session tested mounted archery by having candidates shoot three arrows while riding a horse toward a target at a distance of 35 and 80 paces. The target was in the shape of a man 1.6 meters high. A perfect score was three hits, a good score two, and one hit earned a pass. Those who fell off their horse or failed to score even one hit were eliminated. The second session was held in a garden at the prefectural office. Candidates were ordered to shoot five arrows at a target at 50 paces. Again, five hits were graded excellent while one hit earned a pass. Next they had to bend a bow into the shape of a full moon. The bows were graded by strength into 72 kg, 60 kg, and 48 kg weapons. Bending a 72 kg bow was excellent while bending a 48 kg bow earned a pass. Then they were ordered to perform a number of exercises with a halberd without it touching the ground. The halberds were graded by weight from 72 kg to 48 kg, with the lowest grade weapon earning a pass. For the final portion of the second session, candidates were required to lift a stone 35 cm off the ground. Lifting a 180 kg stone earned an excellent grade, a 150 kg stone good, and a 120 kg stone passing.

The third session involved writing out by memory entire portions of the Seven Military Classics, but only three of the classics were ever used, those being &quot;The Methods of the Sima&quot;, the &quot;Wuzi&quot;, and &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Even just memorizing the reduced portion of the classics was too difficult for most military examinees, who resorted to cheating and bringing with them miniature books to copy, a behavior the examiners let slide owing to the greater weighting of the first two sessions. In some cases the examinees still made mistakes while copying the text word for word. The contents of the military exam were largely the same at the prefectural, provincial, metropolitan, and palace levels, with the only difference being tougher grading.

Military degrees were considered inferior to civil degrees and did not carry the same prestige. The names of civil &quot;jinshi&quot; were carved in marble whereas military &quot;jinshi&quot; were not. While the military and civil services were imagined in Chinese political philosophy as the two wheels of a chariot, in practice, the military examination degree was highly regarded by neither the army or the world at large. Soldiers preferred not having military exam graduates as commanders whose skills in test taking did not necessarily transfer to the army. Final decision for appointment in the military still came down to forces outside the examination system. For example, at the beginning of 755, An Lushan replaced 32 Han Chinese commanders with his own barbarian favorites without any repercussions. During the Qing dynasty, the pre-existing institutions of the Eight Banners and Green Standard Army had their own rules for promotion and left little room for military exam graduates. Some of the few military examination graduates who did achieve distinction include the Tang general Guo Ziyi, the father of the founder of the Song dynasty Zhao Hongyin, Ming generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang, and Ming general turned traitor Wu Sangui. However, these are but a minuscule number among those who passed the 282 military metropolitan exams held between their inception in 702 and abolishment in 1901. Even in desperate times of war, the majority of distinguished military figures in Chinese history have come from civil degree holders. The practices of the Ming and Qing military exams were incorporated into physical education in the Republic of China.

===Translation===
During the Qing dynasty, translation examinations were held for young men from the Eight Banners who held no military post. Manchus, Mongols and Chinese Bannermen were allowed to participate in the Manchu exam while the Mongolian exam was restricted to Mongol Bannermen. The examinees did not take the examinations expecting to become translators. The content of the exam consisted of material from the Manchu or Mongol versions of the Four Books and the Five Classics, while only a minor part of the exam consisted of translation from Chinese into Manchu or Mongolian. Three levels of the exam were implemented but there was no palace examination. The quota on the provincial level was 33 persons for the Manchu, and 9 for the Mongolian examination. The number of graduates declined to just 7 and 3 persons, respectively, in 1828, and 4 and 1 in 1837. In 1840 the Mongolian exam was abolished because there were only 6 candidates. Graduates of the metropolitan translation examination were all given the title of regular metropolitan translation graduate without further gradation or extraordinary designations. Excellent graduates of the Manchu exam were directly appointed secretaries in one of the Six Ministries while those of the Mongol one were commonly made officials in the Court of Colonial Affairs.

===Special===
Besides the regular tests for the &quot;jinshi&quot; and other degrees, there were also occasionally special purpose examinations, by imperial decree (&quot;zhiju&quot;). Decree examinations could be for a number of purposes such as identifying talent for specific assignments, or to satisfy particular interest groups such as ethnic groups and the imperial clan. In the Tang dynasty, the emperor held on occasion irregular examinations for specialized topics. These were open to persons already employed by the government. During the Song dynasty, in 1061, Emperor Renzong of Song decreed special examinations for the purpose of finding men capable of &quot;direct speech and full remonstrance&quot; (&quot;zhiyan jijian&quot;): the testing procedure required the examinees to submit 50 previously prepared essays, 25 on particular contemporary problems, 25 on more general historical governmental themes. In the examination room, the examinees then had a day to write essays on six topics chosen by the test officials, and finally were required to write a 3,000 character essay on a complex policy problem, personally chosen by the emperor, Renzong. Among the few successful candidates were the Su brothers, Su Shi and Su Zhe (who had already attained their &quot;jinshi&quot; degrees, in 1057), with Su Shi scoring exceptionally high in the examinations, and subsequently having copies of his examination essays widely circulated.

==Culture==

===Language===

All Chinese imperial examinations were written in Classical Chinese, also known as Literary Chinese, using the regular script (&quot;kaishu&quot;), which is today the most commonly seen calligraphic style in modern China. The importance of knowledge in Classical Chinese was retained in examination systems in other countries such as in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam, where candidates were required to be well-versed in the Confucian classics, to be able to compose essays and poetry in Classical Chinese, and to be able to write in regular script. Owing to the examination system, Classical Chinese became a basic educational standard throughout these countries. Readers of Classical Chinese did not need to learn spoken Chinese to understand or read the text because of its logographic nature. Texts written in Classical Chinese could be &quot;read and understood by any sufficiently literate person, even if a given text was ultimately voiced in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese and not mutually intelligible in speech&quot;. This shared textual tradition and common understanding of the Confucian canon allowed these countries to communicate with each other through &quot;brush talk&quot; in the absence of a common language.

In both Korea and Japan, forms of writing were developed to assist readers in understanding Classical Chinese. The Korean Gugyeol and Japanese Kanbun Kundoku writing systems modified the Chinese text with markers and annotations to represent their respective languages&#x27; pronunciation and grammatical order. Chinese script was also adapted to write Korean and Japanese in their respective native word order. In Korea this was called the Idu script (official reading) and in Japan, Man&#x27;yōgana (ten thousand leaves). In Japan, Kanbun was used to write official documents from the 8th century until after World War 2. In Korea, the Idu script was used for writing official documents and the civil service examinations from their establishment in 958 to termination in 1894. Vietnamese examinations used Chữ Hán (Chinese script), also called Chữ nho (Confucian script), which is virtually indistinguishable from Classical Chinese in its written form, but uses Vietnamese pronunciations when read aloud. Chữ nho was made the official writing system of Đại Việt in 1174 and remained the writing system of the administration until Vietnam was taken over by France in the 19th century. Similar to Korea and Japan, Vietnam also adapted Chinese script to write the Vietnamese language in what is known as Chữ Nôm (southern characters).

===Poetry===
Some of the main outstanding questions regarding the imperial examinations are in regard to poetry. There is a long history of debate on the usefulness of the procedure of testing the ability of the candidates to write poetry. During the Tang dynasty, a poetry section was added to the examinations, requiring the examinee to compose a &quot;shi&quot; poem in the five-character, 12-line regulated verse form and a &quot;fu&quot; composition of 300 to 400 characters. The poetry requirement remained standard for many decades, despite some controversy, although briefly abolished for the examination year 833–34 (by order of Li Deyu). During the Song dynasty, in the late 1060s Wang Anshi removed the traditional poetry composition sections (regulated verse and &quot;fu&quot;), on the grounds of irrelevancy to the official functions of bureaucratic office: on the other side of the debate, Su Shi (Dongpo) pointed out that the selection of great ministers of the past had not been obstructed by the poetry requirements, that the study and practice of poetry encouraged careful writing, and that the evaluation and grading of poetry was more objective than for the prose essays, due to the strict and detailed rules for writing verse according to the formal requirements.

Starting from the Yuan dynasty, poetry was abolished as a subject in the examinations, being regarded as frivolous. This process was completed at the inception of the following Ming dynasty. It was revived in 1756 by the Qing dynasty.

===Religion===

The imperial examinations influenced traditional Chinese religion as well as contemporary literary tradition. The examination system ostensibly represented the Confucian system in its most rationalist expression and was designed to achieve a society ruled by men of merit, as determined by an objective measure of the candidates&#x27; knowledge and intelligence. In practice, the examinations also included various religious and superstitious beliefs that extend the examinations beyond Confucian idealism. Traditional beliefs about fate, that cosmic forces predestine certain human affairs, and particularly that individual success or failure was subject to the will of Heaven and the influence and intervention by various deities, played into the interpretation of results when taking the tests. Zhong Kui, also known as Chung-kuei, was a deity associated with the examination system. The story is that he was a scholar who took the tests, and, despite his most excellent performance, he was unfairly deprived of the first-place prize by a corrupt system: in response, he killed himself, the act of suicide condemning him to be a ghost. Many people afraid of traveling on roads and paths that may be haunted by evil spirits have worshiped Zhong Kui as a protective deity. Also known as &quot;Kechang Yiwen Lu&quot;, the &quot;Strange Stories from the Examination Halls&quot; was a collection of stories popular among Confucian scholars of the Qing dynasty. The theme of many of the stories is that good deeds are rewarded by success in the examination halls, often by Heaven-inspired deities acting on karmic principles; and evil deeds result in failure, often under the influence of the ghosts of victims.

Some individuals were discriminated against because of their names, due to a naming taboo. For example, because the Tang dynasty poet Li He&#x27;s father&#x27;s name sounded like the &quot;jin&quot;, in &quot;jinshi&quot;, he was discouraged from taking the tests. The claim was that if Li He was called a &quot;jinshi&quot;, it would be against the rule of etiquette that a son not be called by his father&#x27;s name.

==Influence==
===Japan===
Chinese legal institutions and the examination system began to heavily influence Japan during the Tang dynasty. In 728, Sugawara no Kiyotomo took part in the Tang examinations. Near the end of the Tang era, Japan implemented the examination system, which lasted for some 200 years during the Heian period (794–1185). According to the &quot;Records of Palace Examinations&quot;, four &quot;shinshi&quot; (&quot;jinshi&quot;) passed the exams in 916: Fujiwara Takaki, Oue Koretoki, Harubuchi Yoshiki, and Fujiwara Harufusa. Poets such as Sugawara no Michizane and Miyoshi Yoshimune mentioned their experiences with the examinations in their writing:

Like the Chinese examinations, the curriculum revolved around the Confucian canon. As Japanese examinations developed, they diverged in practice from the Chinese ones. The &quot;xiucai&quot; exams became more popular than the &quot;jinshi&quot; because it was simpler and considered more practical. The Japanese examinations were also never opened to the common folk to the same extent as in China during the Song dynasty. Due to aristocratic influence, by the 10th century, only students recommended based on their reputation and record of service could take the exams. While the exams were still held after the 11th century, they had lost all practical value, and any candidates who had been nominated by dignitaries passed unconditionally. The Japanese imperial examinations gradually died out afterwards. The examinations were revived in 1787 during the Edo period. The new examinations, called &quot;sodoku kugin&quot;, were more or less the same as the Chinese ones in terms of content (Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism), but did not confer official titles, only honorary titles. During the early Meiji era, Kanda Takahira wrote a letter advocating for the establishment of a Japanese recruitment system with the Chinese imperial examination system as a model. The proposal failed to gain support.

===Korea===

Korea directly participated in the Chinese imperial examination system during the 9th century when as many as 88 Sillans received degrees after passing the Tang examinations.

The Korean examination system was established in 958 under the reign of Gwangjong of Goryeo. The examination system was spread to Goryeo in 957 by a visiting Hanlin scholar named Shuang Ji from Later Zhou. Gwangjong was highly pleased with Shuang Ji and requested that he remain at the Korean court permanently.

According to Xu Jing, writing during the Song dynasty, the Korean examinations were largely the same as the Chinese ones with some differences:

Some Korean examination practices converged with the Chinese system. By the end of the Goryeo period, a military exam had been added, the triennial schedule observed, and the exam hierarchy organized into provincial, metropolitan, and palace levels, similar to the Chinese. Other practices, such as the inclusion of exams on Buddhism and the worship of Confucius, were not shared with China. Outside China, the examination system was most widely implemented in Korea, with enrollment rates surpassing even that of China. Any free man (not Nobi) was able to take the examinations. At the start of the Joseon period, 33 candidates were selected from every triennial examination, and the number increased to 50 later on. In comparison, China&#x27;s selected candidates after each palace examination were no more than 40 to 300 from the Tang to Ming dynasties while encompassing a landmass six times larger than Korea. By the Joseon period, high offices were closed to aristocrats who had not passed the exams. Over the span of 600 years, the Joseon civil service selected more than 14,606 candidates in the highest level examinations on 744 occasions. The examination system continued until 1894 when it was abolished by the Gabo Reform. All Korean examinations were conducted using the Idu script from their establishment in 958 to their termination in 1894.

=== Vietnam ===

The Confucian examination system in Vietnam was established in 1075 under the Lý dynasty Emperor Lý Nhân Tông and lasted until the Nguyễn dynasty Emperor Khải Định (1919). During the Lý dynasty (1009–1225) the imperial examinations had very limited influence. Only four were held throughout the entire duration of the dynasty, producing a small handful of officials. Later during the Trần dynasty (1225–1400), Trần Thái Tông began to filter students through the Tiến sĩ (&quot;jinshi&quot;) examinations. From 1232 to 1314, ten Tiến sĩ examinations were held. In 1314, 50 Tiến sĩ were recruited in one exam. Throughout most of the Vietnamese examinations&#x27; history, there were only three levels to the Vietnamese system: interprovincial, pre-court, and court. A provincial examination was implemented by the Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1945) in 1807 and a metropolitan examination in 1825. Emperor Minh Mạng (r. 1820–1839) paid special attention to the examinations and even dined with newly recruited Tiến sĩ frequently. Although Confucian content took precedence in the examinations, material on Buddhism and Daoism were also included. In 1429, Lê Thái Tổ ordered famous Buddhist and Daoist monks to take the exams, and if they failed, they had to forfeit their religious life. Elephants were used to guard the examination halls until 1843 when the emperor said it was no longer necessary. During the 845 years of civil service examinations held in Vietnam, about 3,000 candidates passed the highest level exams and had their names carved on stelae in the Temple of Literature in Hanoi.

===In the West===
The imperial examination system was known to Europeans as early as 1570. It received great attention from the Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552–1610), who viewed it and its Confucian appeal to rationalism favorably in comparison to religious reliance on &quot;apocalypse&quot;. Knowledge of Confucianism and the examination system was disseminated broadly in Europe following the Latin translation of Ricci&#x27;s journal in 1614. During the 18th century, the imperial examinations were often discussed in conjunction with Confucianism, which attracted great attention from contemporary European thinkers such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller. In France and Britain, Confucian ideology was used in attacking the privilege of the elite. Figures such as Voltaire claimed that the Chinese had &quot;perfected moral science&quot; and François Quesnay advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. According to Ferdinand Brunetière (1849–1906), followers of Physiocracy such as François Quesnay, whose theory of free trade was based on Chinese classical theory, were sinophiles bent on introducing the &quot;Chinese spirit&quot; to France. Brunetière also claimed that French education was really based on Chinese literary examinations which were popularized in France by philosophers, especially Voltaire. Western perception of China in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy. However those who admired China such as Christian Wolff were sometimes persecuted. In 1721 he gave a lecture at the University of Halle praising Confucianism, for which he was accused of atheism and forced to give up his position at the university.

Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi based much of his inspiration for cameralism on contemporary accounts of the Chinese imperial bureaucracy. The growth of cameralist studies, which played an important role in Prussian civil service training, may be traced to Justi&#x27;s admiration for the Imperial examinations of China. Justi, like other cameralists, also lauded many Chinese public policies including the examination system.

The earliest evidence of examinations in Europe date to 1215 or 1219 in Bologna. These were chiefly oral in the form of a question or answer, disputation, determination, defense, or public lecture. The candidate gave a public lecture of two prepared passages assigned to him from the civil or canon law, and then doctors asked him questions, or expressed objections to answers. Evidence of written examinations do not appear until 1702 at Trinity College, Cambridge. According to Sir Michael Sadler, Europe may have had written examinations since 1518 but the &quot;evidence is not very clear&quot;. In Prussia, medication examinations began in 1725. The Mathematical Tripos, founded in 1747, is commonly believed to be the first honor examination, but James Bass Mullinger considered &quot;the candidates not having really undergone any examination whatsoever&quot; because the qualification for a degree was merely four years of residence. France adopted the examination system in 1791 as a result of the French Revolution but it collapsed after only ten years. Germany implemented the examination system around 1800. In 1840, France set an envoy to Germany to examine its examination system with a view of applying it in France. Competitive exams were set up respectively in 1872, 1879 and 1886 for the three administrative &quot;Grands corps&quot; (Conseil d&#x27;État, Inspection des Finances and Cour des Comptes) until the generalisation of an examination to enter the French Civil Service in 1941.

Englishmen in the 18th century such as Eustace Budgell recommended imitating the Chinese examination system. Adam Smith recommended examinations to qualify for employment in 1776. In 1838, the Congregational church missionary Walter Henry Medhurst considered the Chinese exams to be &quot;worthy of imitating&quot;. In 1806, the British East India Company established a Civil Service College near London for training of the company&#x27;s administrators in India. This was based on the recommendations of East India Company officials serving in China and had seen the Imperial examinations. In 1829, the company introduced civil service examinations in India on a limited basis. This established the principle of qualification process for civil servants in England. In 1847 and 1856, Thomas Taylor Meadows strongly recommended the adoption of the Chinese principle of competitive examinations in Great Britain. Both Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was instrumental in passing the Saint Helena Act 1833, and Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, who prepared the Northcote–Trevelyan Report that catalyzed the British civil service, were familiar with Chinese history and institutions. When the report was brought up in parliament in 1853, Lord Monteagle argued against the implementation of open examinations because it was a Chinese system and China was not an &quot;enlightened country&quot;. Lord Stanley called the examinations the &quot;Chinese Principle&quot;. The Earl of Granville did not deny this but argued in favor of the examination system, considering that the minority Manchus had been able to rule China with it for over 200 years. In 1854, Edwin Chadwick reported that some noblemen did not agree with the measures introduced because they were Chinese. The examination system was finally implemented in the British Indian Civil Service in 1855, prior to which admission into the civil service was purely a matter of patronage, and in England in 1870. Even as late as ten years after the competitive examination plan was passed, people still attacked it as an &quot;adopted Chinese culture&quot;. Alexander Baillie-Cochrane, 1st Baron Lamington insisted that the English &quot;did not know that it was necessary for them to take lessons from the Celestial Empire&quot;. In 1875, Archibald Sayce voiced concern over the prevalence of competitive examinations, which he described as &quot;the invasion of this new Chinese culture&quot;.

After Great Britain&#x27;s successful implementation of systematic, open, and competitive examinations in India in the 19th century, similar systems were instituted in the United Kingdom itself, and in other Western nations. Like the British, the development of the French and American civil service was influenced by the Chinese system. When Thomas Jenckes made a &quot;Report from the Joint Select Committee on Retrenchment&quot; in 1868, it contained a chapter on the civil service in China. In 1870, William Spear wrote a book called &quot;The Oldest and the Newest Empire: China and the United States&quot;, in which he urged the United States government to adopt the Chinese examination system. Like in Britain, many of the American elites scorned the plan to implement competitive examinations, which they considered foreign, Chinese, and &quot;un-American&quot;. As a result, the civil services reform introduced into the House of Representatives in 1868 was not passed until 1883. The Civil Service Commission tried to combat such sentiments in its report:

==Examinations in modern China==
===1912–1949===
After the fall of the Qing in 1912, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the newly risen Republic of China, developed similar procedures for the new political system through an institution called the Examination Yuan, one of the five branches of government, although this was quickly suspended due to the turmoil in China between the two world wars, such as the Warlord era and the Japanese invasion. The Kuomintang administration revived the Examination Yuan in 1947 after the defeat of Japan. This system continues into present times in Taiwan along with the government itself after loss of the mainland to the Chinese Communist Party.

===1949–present===

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), the revolutionary government of Mao Zedong rejected the imperial examination system in favor of cadres chosen for loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. Since the economic reform era of the 1980s, the Civil Service maintains a system of examinations for selection and promotion of civil servants.

In the Republic of China (ROC), the constitution specifies that a public servant cannot be employed without going through an examination. The employment is usually also lifelong (that is, until age of retirement).

<text>Kaifeng () is a prefecture-level city in east-central Henan province, China. It is one of the Eight Ancient Capitals of China, having been the capital eight times in history, and is most known for having been the Chinese capital during the Northern Song dynasty.

As of the 2020 census, 4,824,016 people lived in Kaifeng&#x27;s Prefecture, of whom 1,735,581 lived in the metropolitan area consisting of Xiangfu, Longting, Shunhe Hui, Gulou and Yuwantai Districts. Located along the Yellow River&#x27;s southern bank, it borders the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to the west, Xinxiang to the northwest, Shangqiu to the east, Zhoukou to the southeast, Xuchang to the southwest, and Heze of Shandong to the northeast.

Kaifeng is a major city for scientific research, appearing among the world&#x27;s top 200 cities by scientific output as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is home to a campus of Henan University, one of the national key universities in the Double First Class University Plan.

==Names==
The postal romanization for the city is &quot;Kaifeng&quot;. Its official one-character abbreviation in Chinese is (&quot;Biàn&quot;). Historically it has also been known as:
*&quot;Dàliáng&quot; ()
*&quot;Biànliáng&quot; ()
*&quot;Biànzhōu&quot; ()
*&quot;Nánjīng&quot; (), from its status as the Jurchen Jin&#x27;s southern capital and not to be confused with modern-day Nanjing
*&quot;Dōngjīng&quot; ()
*&quot;Biànjīng&quot; ()

The area was named &quot;Kaifeng&quot; after the Qin&#x27;s conquest of China in the second century BC. The name literally means &quot;opening the border&quot; and figuratively &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;vengeance&quot;. Its name was originally Qifeng (), but the syllable &quot;qi&quot; (Baxter-Sagart: /*kʰˤijʔ/) was changed to the essentially synonymous &quot;kai&quot; (/*Nə-[k]ʰˤəj/, /*[k]ʰˤəj/) to avoid the naming taboo of Liu Qi (Emperor Jing of Han).

==Administration==
The prefecture-level city of Kaifeng administers five districts and four counties:
*Gulou District
*Longting District
*Yuwangtai District
*Xiangfu District
*Shunhe Hui District
*Weishi County
*Qi County
*Tongxu County
*Lankao County
==History==

Kaifeng is one of the Eight Ancient Capitals of China. As with Beijing, there have been many reconstructions during its history.

In 364 BC during the Warring States period, the State of Wei founded a city called Daliang () as its capital in this area. During this period, the first of many canals in the area was constructed linking a local river to the Yellow River. When the State of Qin conquered the State of Wei, Kaifeng was destroyed and abandoned except for a mid-sized market town, which remained in place.

During the Han dynasty, the city underwent some reconstruction. Kaifeng became the capital of Liu Wu (son of Han emperor Wen) when he was enfeoffed as Prince of Liang. Liu Wu restored and constructed many buildings and old city walls. Kaifeng became a center of music, art, a refuge for artists, and of splendid gardens despite the trivial political importance of the city at this period.

Early in the 7th century, Kaifeng was transformed into a major commercial hub when it was connected to the Grand Canal as well as through the construction of a canal running to western Shandong.

In 781 during the Tang dynasty, a new city was reconstructed and named Bian (). Bian was the capital of the Later Liang, Later Jin (936–946), Later Han (947–950), and Later Zhou (951–960) of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The Song dynasty made Bian its capital when it overthrew the Later Zhou (Chenqiao incident) in 960. Shortly afterwards, the city underwent further expansion.

During the Song, when it was known as Dongjing or Bianjing, Kaifeng, then the largest and most prosperous city in China, was the capital, with a population of over 400,000 living both inside and outside the city wall. Typhus was an acute problem in the city. The historian Jacques Gernet provides a lively picture of life in this period in his &quot;Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion, 1250-1276,&quot; which often draws on &quot;Dongjing Meng Hua Lu&quot;, a nostalgic memoir of the city of Kaifeng.

In 1049, the Youguosi Pagoda () – or Iron Pagoda as it is called today – was constructed measuring in height. It has survived the vicissitudes of war and floods to become the oldest landmark in this ancient city. Another Song-dynasty pagoda, , dating from 974, has been partially destroyed.
Another well-known sight was the astronomical clock tower of the engineer, scientist, and statesman Su Song (1020–1101 AD). It was crowned with a rotating armillary sphere that was hydraulically powered (i.e. by water wheel and a water clock), yet it incorporated an escapement mechanism two hundred years before they were found in the clockworks of Europe and featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive.

Kaifeng reached its peak importance in the 11th century as a commercial and industrial center at the intersection of four major canals. During this time, the city was surrounded by three rings of city walls and probably had a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. It is believed that Kaifeng was the largest city in the world from 1013 to 1127.

This period ended in 1127 when the city fell to Jurchen invaders during the Jingkang Incident. It subsequently came under the rule of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, which had conquered most of North China during the Jin–Song Wars. While it remained an important administrative center, only the area inside the inner city wall of the early Song remained settled and the two outer rings were abandoned.

As the imperial capital of the Song, Kaifeng was conveniently situated along the Grand Canal for logistics supply but militarily vulnerable due to its position on the floodplains of the Yellow River.

Kaifeng served as the Jurchen &quot;southern capital&quot; from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time. The Jurchen kept their main capital further north until 1214 when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to Kaifeng in order to flee from the onslaught of the Mongols. In 1232 they succumbed to the combined Mongol and Song forces in the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The Mongols captured the city and in 1279 conquered all of China. During the Yuan dynasty Bianliang became the capital of Henan Jiangbei Province, which was established in 1277.
In the Mongol siege of Kaifeng, the Mongols and Han Chinese (who defected to the Mongols) slaughtered the male members of the Jin Jurchen Wanyan Imperial family and took the royal women including the Jin concubines and princesses to Mongolia as war booty. Mongols looted the city when it fell, but atypical to most sieges in the time period, they permitted trade. The richest residents of the city sold their luxury belongings to Mongol soldiers for critically needed food supplies. Male members of the Jurchen Jin Wanyan royal family residing in the city were captured and executed. All Jin imperial concubines, including the empress dowager, were captured and taken north.

In 1260, Marco Polo arrived at Kaifeng, and wrote about it in his diaries.

The city was briefly captured around the mid-14th century by the Red Turban rebels who made it their capital for ten years. They were crushed by the newly established Ming forces. At the beginning of the Ming dynasty in 1368, Kaifeng was made the capital of Henan province.

In 1642, Kaifeng was flooded by the Ming army with water from the Yellow River to prevent the peasant rebel Li Zicheng from taking over. After this disaster, the city was abandoned again.

<text>Angela&#x27;s Ashes: A Memoir is a 1996 memoir by the Irish-American author Frank McCourt, with various anecdotes and stories of his childhood. The book details his early childhood in Brooklyn, New York, but focuses primarily on his life in Limerick, Ireland. It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father&#x27;s alcoholism.

The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The sequel &quot;&#x27;Tis&quot; was published in 1999, followed by &quot;Teacher Man&quot; in 2005.

==Synopsis==
The narrative is told from the point of view of Frank McCourt as a child. Born in Brooklyn, New York on 19 August 1930, Frank (Francis) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt. Both of his parents immigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela&#x27;s pregnancy with Frankie. Angela is from Limerick, Ireland, and she is fond of music, singing, and dancing. Malachy, from Northern Ireland, is an alcoholic known for his having an &quot;odd manner&quot; and for telling stories about Irish heroes. Frankie is said to resemble his father, having a hang-dog face and the same &quot;odd manner.&quot; 

In Brooklyn, the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor, and an indoor lavatory, with other immigrant families. Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn: Malachy, born in 1931; twins Oliver and Eugene, born in 1932; and an infant sister, Margaret, in 1935.

The family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr&#x27;s efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism. The family&#x27;s prospects, and Angela&#x27;s spirits, lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages, but soon he spends all of his pay in pubs despite Angela&#x27;s efforts to prevent him from doing so. Malachy Sr loses each job after a few weeks as a result of his heavy drinking.

Margaret&#x27;s birth instills new life into the family: The whole family falls in love with her, Malachy Sr most of all. He stops drinking and finds steady work to support the family. Due to her parents&#x27; ignorance of childhood disease, Margaret lives for only seven weeks. With her death, Malachy Sr goes on an alcoholic binge, and Angela suffers severe depression. Frank, age 4, feeds and cares for his younger siblings until the neighbours help. The neighbours contact Angela&#x27;s cousins, who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland. Angela is pregnant as they return to Ireland from America, but she loses the child shortly after moving to Limerick.

The Great Depression strikes Ireland even harder than it does the United States. The family first goes to Malachy&#x27;s family home in Toome in County Antrim, where his parents tell them there is no work. He tries Dublin, hoping for a pension from his fighting days, but that does not materialise. They settle in Angela&#x27;s original hometown of Limerick. Conditions for poor families are miserable. Malachy Sr finds it difficult to find work because of his Northern Irish accent and mannerisms, and the boys are mocked for their American accents.

The family is forced to rely on the dole and charity from the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which requires a humiliating application process. Angela and Malachy Sr argue about their conditions, Malachy spends the welfare money meant to feed the family, and he views Angela&#x27;s asking for charity as degrading. The young family subsists on little more than bread and tea.

Within a year of the family&#x27;s arrival, Oliver and Eugene also die. Oliver dies first, and then Eugene, a few months later, from grieving the loss of his twin and pneumonia. After each death, Angela is depressed, and the family moves to another house. Each move is a slide into worse circumstances. They settle in a slum house. The entire ground floor floods for half the year, requiring the family to live in the upstairs rooms, called Italy, until the rains cease, when they again have access to the ground floor, Ireland. Their house is next to the only lavatory on the street. The traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the lavatory is offensive. Two more baby brothers, Michael (born 1936), and Alphie (Alphonsus Joseph, b. 1940), are born in Limerick.

Frankie grows up in Limerick as an intelligent boy, but always hungry. He makes unique observations about those around him. His strict Catholic upbringing in the local public school preys on him: Will he be going to hell? This plagues his mind as soon as he has been taught to make confession at age 7. He sees his father as three people: the man who rises early in the morning and talks with Frank; the man who tells stories to his sons in the evening; and the man who drinks too much, sings old songs, and asks his young sons to promise to die for Ireland.

Frank gets typhoid fever at age 10, and he is taken to the hospital for months, where for the first time he has adequate food, warmth, clean sheets, and access to books with the time to read them. Frankie contracts chronic conjunctivitis the next year, which does not heal, requiring treatments.

When the U.S. joins World War 2, many Limerick men, including Malachy Sr, find work at defence plants in Coventry, England, and they send money home. The first payment from Malachy Sr allows the family to buy food and pay the rent. Soon after, the money stops coming, and at age 11, Frank is the man of the house.

When their mother is ill, Frank and his brothers steal leftover food from restaurants and grocery deliveries from doorsteps of wealthier homes until they are sent to stay with their aunt while their mother recuperates in the hospital.

After a humorous few weeks of burning the second floor wall for the cooking fire, the family is evicted and homeless. At her mother&#x27;s suggestion, Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin, Laman Griffin, who is a petty tyrant. Frank endures this treatment until the day after his schooling ends in June, and he is promised the loan of Laman&#x27;s bicycle to join his friends, but Laman reneges on his promise. Added to this disappointment, Laman&#x27;s deal to provide housing includes a sexual relationship with Angela. Frankie fights with Laman, and he is thrown out of the house. Shortly after, Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin&#x27;s to join the British military as a bugle boy.

Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle, a simple man who was &quot;dropped on his head as a child&quot; and lives alone in the house. Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his 14th birthday and enjoys his first wages. He meets many unexpected situations while delivering telegrams, including his first girlfriend, who dies of tuberculosis. He meets Mrs Finucane who buys clothes for people at a discount, and then they pay her back over time for the full price; she asks Frank to write threatening letters to encourage them to repay these loans. He tells no one about this job, which he has until she dies.

A few months after he moves, the rest of the family follows him to the house. Frank now turns over the majority of his wages to his mother. He works for the post office until he is 16, and he finds a job with Eason&#x27;s, a company that supplies magazines and newspapers to Limerick stores.

On his 16th birthday, Frank&#x27;s uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer. Frank gets drunk and heads home. When his mother shames him for drinking like his father, Frank hits her, accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin, and he is immediately ashamed of himself.

Shortly before he turns 19, Frank returns to Mrs Finucane’s home to find she has died. Frank takes some of the money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts. This freedom from the debt gives him enough money to sail to New York. Frank arrives in Poughkeepsie, New York where the ship docks, and he agrees with a ship&#x27;s crew man that it is a great country.

==Literary significance and reception==
According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;rave&quot; reviews based on three critic reviews with three being &quot;rave&quot;.

Michiko Kakutani concluded her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; by writing &quot;The reader of this stunning memoir can only hope that Mr. McCourt will set down the story of his subsequent adventures in America in another book. &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; is so good it deserves a sequel.&quot; McCourt &quot;has used the storytelling gifts he inherited from his father to write a book that redeems the pain of his early years with wit and compassion and grace.&quot; The book is compared &quot;with &quot;The Liars Club&quot; by Mary Karr and Andre Aciman&#x27;s &quot;Out of Egypt&quot; as a classic modern memoir.&quot; McCourt writes without bitterness about his epic tale of woe, though &quot;there is plenty a less generous writer might well be judgmental about.&quot; The review is peppered with quotations from the book showing the author&#x27;s style. Kakutani remarks that &quot;Writing in prose that&#x27;s pictorial and tactile, lyrical but streetwise, Mr. McCourt does for the town of Limerick what the young Joyce did for Dublin: he conjures the place for us with such intimacy that we feel we&#x27;ve walked its streets and crawled its pubs.&quot; This review is strong in its analysis of the book as well-written and modern, comparable with great writers. The scope of the &quot;memoir is not just the story of his family&#x27;s struggles, but the story of his own sentimental education: his discovery of poetry and girls, and his efforts to come to terms with God and death and faith. By 11, he&#x27;s the chief breadwinner for the family. By 15, he&#x27;s lost his first girlfriend to tuberculosis. By 19, he&#x27;s saved enough money to make his escape to the States.&quot;

In its review, &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; has strong praise: &quot;An extraordinary work in every way. McCourt magically retrieves love, dignity, and humor from a childhood of hunger, loss and pain.&quot; This is the first book by McCourt. It is &quot;a powerful, exquisitely written debut, a recollection of the author&#x27;s miserable childhood in the slums of Limerick, Ireland, during the Depression and World War II.&quot;

Nina King wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;This memoir is an instant classic of the genre -- all the more remarkable for being the 66-year-old McCourt&#x27;s first book.&quot; She summarized her review by saying that &quot;&quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; confirms the worst old stereotypes about the Irish, portraying them as drunken, sentimental, bigoted, bloody-minded dreamers, repressed sexually and oppressed politically, nursing ancient grievances while their children (their far-too-many children) go hungry. ... at the same time that it transcends them through the sharpness and precision of McCourt&#x27;s observation and the wit and beauty of his prose.&quot; 

Reviewing the book at its publication in 1996, John Blades wrote in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;Like McCourt himself, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; is a bundle of contradictions, as uproarious as they are grievous, whether the young Frankie is pushing his baby brother around Limerick, dumping loose coal and turf into his pram; his &quot;pious, defeated&quot; mother is begging a sheep&#x27;s head for their Christmas dinner; or his soused father is rousing the boys in the middle of the night to sing &quot;Kevin Barry&quot; and other patriotic Irish songs.&quot; The book event was held in at the Mercury Theater and the adjoining Chicago bar; the book is a debut for McCourt but he had &quot;been a familiar figure on local stages during the &#x27;80s. Billing themselves as &quot;A Couple of Blaguards,&quot; he and his younger brother, Malachy, re-enacted their Limerick boyhood in story, song and verse for audiences at the Royal George and other theaters.&quot; McCourt&#x27;s book places &quot;McCourt&#x27;s mother, Angela, [as] the nominal heroine of his memoir, eternally on the dole, pathetically trying to clothe and feed her sons. But it&#x27;s the blackguard father, also named Malachy, who obsesses McCourt, and who commandeers center stage in his memoir, long after he&#x27;s abandoned his wife and family.&quot; At the book event, McCourt notes that most of the reviews of his memoir call it &quot;lyrical and charming,&quot; but he says that &quot;what gives Irish writing its distinctive flavor is not the charming stuff but the darkness.&quot;

In a review of the book and its audio book version released in 1997, Gayle Sims wrote that it is the &quot;only book that I unequivocally recommend listening to instead of reading.&quot; She explains why the narration makes a better experience than reading on paper, as the author &quot;reads the narrative in his everyday dialect, yet he is able to give it the voice of a child. This works particularly well because &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; is written from a child&#x27;s unjudging perspective.&quot; Although the tough, challenging and sad events of his childhood might present a negative story to the reader or listener, &quot;The book is full of tears and laughter. McCourt is forgiving of his family&#x27;s tragic life. When he reads, there is no rancor in his voice.&quot;

Writing a review in 2020, Ashley Nelson stated &quot;This story is challenging to the emotions; it deals with many elements and situations that make people uncomfortable. However, it has you holding back laughter, as Frank McCourt has this magical ability to make light of being starving in the pouring rain walking through the streets of Limerick. This book has you feel love, loss, fear, hunger, and the will to overcome uncertainty.&quot; This book is a &quot;quintessential coming of age story viewed through the grimy, unyielding, and sometimes downright heartbreaking lens of poverty. It follows Frank McCourt as he comically explains the dire circumstances of his conception, birth, and life.&quot;

==Background==
After traveling to America (where the book ends), McCourt worked at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City, where he remained until 1951. He was drafted during the Korean War to be stationed in Bavaria, Germany. After being discharged, he returned to New York and dabbled with several different jobs until he was accepted into New York University. After graduating in 1957 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English, McCourt turned to teaching in New York schools. He then obtained his master&#x27;s degree and traveled to Dublin in pursuit of his PhD, which he never completed.

==Awards==
&quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; won several awards, including the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, the 1996 National Book Critics Circle Award (Biography), and the 1997 Boeke Prize.

Frank McCourt was elected Irish American of the Year in 1998.

==Disputed memories==
McCourt was accused of exaggerating his family&#x27;s impoverished upbringing by many Limerick natives, including Richard Harris. McCourt&#x27;s mother denied the accuracy of his stories shortly before her death in 1981, walking out of a stage performance by her two elder sons; Malachy&#x27;s recollection is that she said it was &quot;all a pack of lies.&quot;

Local writer and filmmaker Gerry Hannan has compiled a list of 204 inaccuracies in &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;; Hannan confronted McCourt on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1999. Hannan claimed that as McCourt was a member of the Boy Scouts, a middle-class pursuit the poor could not afford, and family photographs show the children and Angela as well-fed.

American journalist John Meyer visited Limerick and took the tour of the city sparked by publication of the book. He realized how much the city had changed since McCourt&#x27;s childhood years, including destruction of the slum area where his family lived when Frank was in school.

McCourt described the book as &quot;a memoir, not an exact history&quot;, and admitted to fabricating the story about Willie Harrold&#x27;s sisters. Similarly, Alan Parker, who directed the film version, said that &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; &quot;was a work of art which met Gore Vidal&#x27;s definition of autobiography, being an &#x27;impression&#x27; of a life, rather than a memoir.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
In 1999 a film version was released. It was co-written and directed by Alan Parker starring Joe Breen, Ciarán Owens, and Michael Legge, as the Young, Middle and Older Frank McCourt respectively and Emily Watson as McCourt&#x27;s mother Angela, Robert Carlyle as the father.

The film begins when the McCourt family move back to Ireland after experiencing hardship in America. Many of the Street scenes were filmed in Cork, Ireland. The film soundtrack was composed and conducted by John Williams, and features songs by Billie Holiday and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

===Musical===
A stage musical adaptation of &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; by Adam Howell (Music &amp; Lyrics) and Paul Hurt (Book) received its world premiere at the Lime Tree Theatre, Limerick on July 6, 2017 with following performances at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre, Dublin and the Grand Opera House, Belfast. McCourt&#x27;s wife, Ellen Frey McCourt, remarked about making a musical from that memoir, before it opened in Limerick, that &quot;The movie does not have the humour of the book, or that this musical has.” Moreover, she adds, “if you think about it, was &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; a good example of a musical subject? Or Oliver!, or Annie? There’s a silver lining in each of these shows, and &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; is really a story about a family triumphing over adversity.&quot;

<doc id="244490" wikidata="Q1061918" url="?curid=244490" title="SOCKS">
<text>SOCKS is an Internet protocol that exchanges network packets between a client and server through a proxy server. SOCKS5 optionally provides authentication so only authorized users may access a server. Practically, a SOCKS server proxies TCP connections to an arbitrary IP address, and provides a means for UDP packets to be forwarded. A SOCKS server accepts incoming client connection on TCP port 1080, as defined in .

==History==
The protocol was originally developed/designed by David Koblas, a system administrator of MIPS Computer Systems. After MIPS was taken over by Silicon Graphics in 1992, Koblas presented a paper on SOCKS at that year&#x27;s Usenix Security Symposium, making SOCKS publicly available. The protocol was extended to version 4 by Ying-Da Lee of NEC.

The SOCKS reference architecture and client are owned by Permeo Technologies, a spin-off from NEC. (Blue Coat Systems bought out &quot;Permeo Technologies&quot;, and were in turn acquired by Symantec.)

The SOCKS5 protocol was originally a security protocol that made firewalls and other security products easier to administer. It was approved by the IETF in 1996 as (authored by: M. Leech, M. Ganis, Y. Lee, R. Kuris, D. Koblas, and L. Jones). The protocol was developed in collaboration with Aventail Corporation, which markets the technology outside of Asia.

==Acronym==
SOCKS is sometimes defined as an acronym for &quot;socket secure&quot; from at least 2001, although it was not originally defined as such in the SOCKS Protocol Version 5 RFC in 1996 or the UNIX Security Symposium III paper in 1992 but simply referred to a specific proxy protocol designed to facilitate communication between clients and servers through a firewall.

==Usage==
&quot;SOCKS&quot; is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for circuit-level gateways (level 5 gateways).

The circuit/session level nature of SOCKS make it a versatile tool in forwarding any TCP (or UDP since SOCKS5) traffic, creating an interface for all types of routing tools. It can be used as:

* A circumvention tool, allowing traffic to bypass Internet filtering to access content otherwise blocked, e.g., by governments, workplaces, schools, and country-specific web services. Since SOCKS is very detectable, a common approach is to present a SOCKS interface for more sophisticated protocols:
** The Tor onion proxy software presents a SOCKS interface to its clients.
* Providing similar functionality to a virtual private network, allowing connections to be forwarded to a server&#x27;s &quot;local&quot; network:
** Some SSH suites, such as OpenSSH, support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user to create a local SOCKS proxy. This can free the user from the limitations of connecting only to a predefined remote port and server.

==Protocol==

===SOCKS4===

A typical SOCKS4 connection request looks like this:

;VER: SOCKS version number, 0x04 for this version
;CMD: command code:
:*0x01 = establish a TCP/IP stream connection
:*0x02 = establish a TCP/IP port binding
;DSTPORT:2-byte port number (in network byte order)
;DESTIP: IPv4 Address, 4 bytes (in network byte order)
;ID: the user ID string, variable length, null-terminated.
;VN: reply version, null byte
;REP: reply code
;DSTPORT: destination port, meaningful if granted in BIND, otherwise ignore
;DSTIP: destination IP, as above – the ip:port the client should bind to

For example, this is a SOCKS4 request to connect Fred to &quot;66.102.7.99:80&quot;, the server replies with an &quot;OK&quot;:

*Client: codice_1
**The last field is &quot;Fred&quot; in ASCII, followed by a null byte.
*Server: codice_2
**0xXX can be any byte value. The SOCKS4 protocol specifies that the values of these bytes should be ignored.

From this point onwards, any data sent from the SOCKS client to the SOCKS server is relayed to 66.102.7.99, and vice versa.

The command field may be 0x01 for &quot;connect&quot; or 0x02 for &quot;bind&quot;; the &quot;bind&quot; command allows incoming connections for protocols such as active FTP.

===SOCKS4a===

SOCKS4a extends the SOCKS4 protocol to allow a client to specify a destination domain name rather than an IP address; this is useful when the client itself cannot resolve the destination host&#x27;s domain name to an IP address. It was proposed by Ying-Da Lee, the author of SOCKS4.

The client should set the first three bytes of DSTIP to NULL and the last byte to a non-zero value. (This corresponds to IP address 0.0.0.x, with x nonzero, an inadmissible destination address and thus should never occur if the client can resolve the domain name.) Following the NULL byte terminating USERID, the client must send the destination domain name and terminate it with another NULL byte. This is used for both &quot;connect&quot; and &quot;bind&quot; requests.

Client to SOCKS server:

;SOCKS4_C: SOCKS4 client handshake packet (above)
;DOMAIN: the domain name of the host to contact , null (0x00) terminated

Server to SOCKS client: (Same as SOCKS4)

A server using protocol SOCKS4a must check the DSTIP in the request packet. If it represents address 0.0.0.x with nonzero x, the server must read in the domain name that the client sends in the packet. The server should resolve the domain name and make connection to the destination host if it can.

===SOCKS5===

The SOCKS5 protocol is defined in . It is an incompatible extension of the SOCKS4 protocol; it offers more choices for authentication and adds support for IPv6 and UDP, the latter of which can be used for DNS lookups. The initial handshake consists of the following:
*Client connects and sends a greeting, which includes a list of authentication methods supported.
*Server chooses one of the methods (or sends a failure response if none of them are acceptable).
*Several messages may now pass between the client and the server, depending on the authentication method chosen.
*Client sends a connection request similar to SOCKS4.
*Server responds similar to SOCKS4.

The initial greeting from the client is:

; VER: SOCKS version (0x05)
; NAUTH: Number of authentication methods supported, uint8
; AUTH: Authentication methods, 1 byte per method supported
:The authentication methods supported are numbered as follows:
:*0x00: No authentication
:*0x01: GSSAPI ()
:*0x02: Username/password ()
:*0x03–0x7F: methods assigned by IANA
:**0x03: Challenge–Handshake Authentication Protocol
:**0x04: Unassigned
:**0x05: Challenge–Response Authentication Method
:**0x06: Secure Sockets Layer
:**0x07: NDS Authentication
:**0x08: Multi-Authentication Framework
:**0x09: JSON Parameter Block
:**0x0A–0x7F: Unassigned
:*0x80–0xFE: methods reserved for private use
; VER: SOCKS version (0x05)
; CAUTH: chosen authentication method, or 0xFF if no acceptable methods were offered

The subsequent authentication is method-dependent. Username and password authentication (method 0x02) is described in :
; VER: 0x01 for current version of username/password authentication
; IDLEN, ID: Username length, uint8; username as bytestring
; PWLEN, PW: Password length, uint8; password as bytestring
; VER: 0x01 for current version of username/password authentication
; STATUS: 0x00 success, otherwise failure, connection must be closed

After authentication the connection can proceed. We first define an address datatype as:

; TYPE: type of the address. One of:
:*0x01: IPv4 address
:*0x03: Domain name
:*0x04: IPv6 address
; ADDR: the address data that follows. Depending on type:
:*4 bytes for IPv4 address
:*1 byte of name length followed by 1–255 bytes for the domain name
:*16 bytes for IPv6 address
; VER: SOCKS version (0x05)
; CMD: command code:
:*0x01: establish a TCP/IP stream connection
:*0x02: establish a TCP/IP port binding
:*0x03: associate a UDP port
; RSV: reserved, must be 0x00
; DSTADDR: destination address, see the address structure above.
; DSTPORT: port number in a network byte order
; VER: SOCKS version (0x05)
; STATUS: status code:
:*0x00: request granted
:*0x01: general failure
:*0x02: connection not allowed by ruleset
:*0x03: network unreachable
:*0x04: host unreachable
:*0x05: connection refused by destination host
:*0x06: TTL expired
:*0x07: command not supported / protocol error
:*0x08: address type not supported
; RSV: reserved, must be 0x00
; BNDADDR: server bound address in the &quot;SOCKS5 address&quot; format specified above
; BNDPORT: server bound port number in a network byte order

Since clients are allowed to use either resolved addresses or domain names, a convention from cURL exists to label the domain name variant of SOCKS5 &quot;socks5h&quot;, and the other simply &quot;socks5&quot;. A similar convention exists between SOCKS4a and SOCKS4.

==Software==

===Servers===

====SOCKS proxy server implementations====
* Sun Java System Web Proxy Server is a caching proxy server running on Solaris, Linux and Windows servers that support HTTPS, NSAPI I/O filters, dynamic reconfiguration, SOCKSv5 and reverse proxy.
* WinGate is a multi-protocol proxy server and SOCKS server for Microsoft Windows which supports SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5 (including UDP-ASSOCIATE and GSSAPI auth). It also supports handing over SOCKS connections to the HTTP proxy, so can cache and scan HTTP over SOCKS.
* Socksgate5 SocksGate5 is an application-SOCKS firewall with inspection feature on Layer 7 of the OSI model, the Application Layer. Because packets are inspected at 7 OSI Level the application-SOCKS firewall may search for protocol non-compliance and blocking specified content.
* Dante is a circuit-level SOCKS server that can be used to provide convenient and secure network connectivity, requiring only the host Dante runs on to have external network connectivity.
* HevSocks5Server is a high-performance and low-overhead SOCKS server for Unix (Linux/BSD/macOS). It supports standard TCP-CONNECT and UDP-ASSOCIATE methods and multiple username/password authentication.

====Other programs providing SOCKS server interface====
* OpenSSH allows dynamic creation of tunnels, specified via a subset of the SOCKS protocol, supporting the CONNECT command.
* PuTTY is a Win32 SSH client that supports local creation of SOCKS (dynamic) tunnels through remote SSH servers.
* Secure ShellFish is a SSH client for iOS and macOS that includes a SOCKS server.
* ShimmerCat is a web server that uses SOCKS5 to simulate an internal network, allowing web developers to test their local sites without modifying their /etc/hosts file. 
* Tor is a system intended to enable online anonymity. Tor offers a TCP-only SOCKS server interface to its clients.
* Shadowsocks is a circumvent censorship tool. It provides a SOCKS5 interface.
* netcat implementations, as Ncat and socat.

===Clients===

Client software must have native SOCKS support in order to connect through SOCKS.

====Browser====
*Chrome: support SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5.
*Firefox: support SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5.
*Internet Explorer and EdgeHTML-based Microsoft Edge: support SOCKS4 only.
*Chromium-based Microsoft Edge: support SOCKS4, SOCKS4a and SOCKS5.

There are programs that allow users to circumvent such limitations:

====Socksifiers====
Socksifiers allow applications to access the networks to use a proxy without needing to support any proxy protocols. The most common way is to set up a virtual network adapter and appropriate routing tables to send traffic through the adapter.
*Win2Socks, which enables applications to access the network through SOCKS5, HTTPS or Shadowsocks.
*tun2socks, an open source tool that creates virtual TCP TUN adapters from a SOCKS proxy, capable of UDP if supported on another end. Works on Linux and Windows, has a macOS port and reimplementation in Golang. Another written in C with good-performance, works on Linux/Android/BSD/macOS and iOS
*proxychains, a Unix program that forces TCP traffic through SOCKS or HTTP proxies on (dynamically-linked) programs it launches. Works on various Unix-like systems.

====Translating proxies====
* Polipo, a discontinued forwarding and caching HTTP/1.1 proxy server with IPv4 support. Open Source running on Linux, OpenWrt, Windows, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Almost any Web browser can use it.
* Privoxy, a non-caching SOCKS-to-HTTP proxy.
* Tinyproxy, a light-weight HTTP/HTTPS proxy daemon for POSIX operating systems. Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet small. It presents an http proxy interface and can connect to SOCKS4/5 and http upstream proxies.

== Security ==

Due to lack of request and packets exchange encryption it makes SOCKS practically vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and IP addresses eavesdropping which in consequence clears a way to censorship by governments.

<doc id="244494" wikidata="Q834000" url="?curid=244494" title="Hutt River (New Zealand)">
<text>The Hutt River (, or ; officially Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River) flows through the southern North Island of New Zealand. It flows south-west from the southern Tararua Range for , forming a number of fertile floodplains, including Kaitoke, central Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt.

The Hutt River Trail, a regional park administered by Wellington Regional Council, runs alongside the eastern side of the river.

==Toponymy==

Early Māori residents, such as Ngāi Tara, called the river Te Awa Kairangi. Later Māori settlers named it Te Wai o Orutu after Orutu, a Ngāti Mamoe ancestor. By the time European settlers arrived, Māori called it Heretaunga, a name adopted by an Upper Hutt suburb and secondary school.

The river was named &quot;Hutt&quot; after Sir William Hutt, chairman of the New Zealand Company. This name was given by Captain Edward Main Chaffers and Colonel William Wakefield while charting Port Nicholson in 1839. The official name since 2011 is Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River.

==Geography==

For most of its length, the Hutt is a shallow and sometimes braided river in a wide rocky bed, but in the Kaitoke gorge the river flows directly over bedrock, and approaching the mouth at Petone the river is narrower and the banks steeper. The larger populated areas in Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt are protected from flooding by stopbanks and introduced willow trees, as is common in New Zealand.

The headwaters in the Kaitoke Regional Park are closed to preserve the quality of the drinking water drawn off at Kaitoke to supply the greater Wellington area. Below Kaitoke is the Kaitoke Gorge, a popular destination for rafting. Below the gorge is Te Mārua, where the Mangaroa River joins the Hutt from the east.

Further down, at Birchville, the Akatarawa River joins the Hutt from the west. Here it flows in a deep channel between the surrounding hills and is turned to flow across the Wellington Fault to Maoribank. The movement of the fault can be seen from the displacement of the river terraces in Harcourt Park.

At the top of the Upper Hutt floodplain, the river makes a sharp turn against the bedrock at the foot of the cliff at Maoribank to flow down the valley. The Upper Hutt floodplain contains the greater portion of Upper Hutt city. The Whakatiki River joins the Hutt from the west and it is about this point the river starts to flow along the virtually straight Wellington geologic fault, which lies on the western side of the river valley.

At the lower end of the Upper Hutt floodplain is Taita Gorge, which separates Upper Hutt from Lower Hutt; this gorge is significantly shorter and less constricting than Kaitoke Gorge. The river&#x27;s outflow, at Petone, is into Wellington Harbour. The geological fault that the river previously followed continues as a steep bluff at the edge of the Wellington Harbour.

The Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, sometimes referred to as the Hutt Aquifer, is a pressurized zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley and Wellington Harbour which provides about 40% of the public fresh water supply for Lower Hutt and Wellington city. Water flows down into the aquifer from a five-kilometre stretch of the Hutt River south of Taita Gorge, at the rate of 1000 litres per second. It takes several years for water in the underground aquifer to reach Waterloo from the Taita Gorge, and about 10 years to reach the Petone foreshore. The water level in Wellington Harbour was much lower 20,000 years ago, and the ancient Hutt River used to flow down a paleochannel to the east of Matiu / Somes Island as far as the present-day Miramar Peninsula. Much of the water in the Waiwhetu Aquifer moves under the sea bed from the direction of the Hutt River to the Falcon Shoals area (between Karaka Bay and Worser Bay) at the harbour mouth via the paleochannel.

State Highway 2 follows the course of the river for most of its length, with the exception of the Kaitoke Gorge and the head waters, before crossing the Remutaka Range into the Wairarapa.

In the early nineteenth century, the Hutt River was deeper than it is now and navigable for some distance by large canoes and boats. Māori would take produce grown in the Hutt Valley down the river by canoe and across the harbour to Wellington city. Thick bush grew down to the water&#x27;s edge. When early European settlers cleared the bush, the river banks began to disintegrate and collapse into the river. This led to soil being washed into the river, more flooding and changes in the river&#x27;s course. Writing in 1880, James Coutts Crawford described the river as he had seen it in 1840:The alluvial land on the banks of the Hutt was at this time covered by a dense forest, many of the trees being of gigantic size. Boats could ascend the river to the locality of the present bridge [near the current Ewen Bridge], and the sight of the foliage on the banks at this point, with the white clematis hanging in graceful folds from the lofty branches, was superb. The river being much narrower that it is now, while the valley was under forest, the flood waters would necessarily be held back, and the scour and rush of gravel and sand that has since contributed to widen it did not then prevail to nearly the same extent.The river was also changed by a major earthquake in 1855 that raised the riverbed.

The regular flooding of Lower Hutt resulted in highly fertile land and prior to the building of state housing by the first Labour Government starting in 1937, there were many market gardens in Lower Hutt.

Well-established foot tracks along the river were formally signposted in the 1990s, through a collaboration between Wellington Regional Council, local Rotary International clubs, Hutt City Council, Upper Hutt City Council and other groups.

==Recreation==

The Hutt River Trail, a 29 kilometre cycling and walking route, follows the entire length of the river from Petone to Kaitoke Regional Park at Upper Hutt, linking up to Kaitoke Regional Park. Most of the track is gravel, but some is sealed or grass. Some low-lying parts of the track can be affected by flooding.

There are several spots for swimming, fishing and kayaking. The trail includes some filming locations for the Lord of the Rings film franchise.

The Lower Hutt Parkrun runs along the last section of the Hutt River from just north of the Ewen Bridge down to the Waione Street Bridge and back.

==Ecology==
The river has a good stock of brown trout.

==Bridges==

Heading downstream:
*Kaitoke Swingbridges, two footbridges in Kaitoke Regional Park.
*Te Mārua Bridgem a demolished bridge.
*Akatarawa Road Bridge, a two-lane road bridge opened in 1981 to replace a single-lane road bridge opened in 1915 and demolished in 1982. Abutments of the old bridge remain in the adjacent downstream riverbank and a pier footing remains in the river bed.
*Akatarawa Bridge, the old Hutt County Council wooden truss bridge that crossed the river near the intersection of Rata Street and Birch Terrace with Akatarawa Road. The bridge was constructed in 1880-81 and closed in 1953. Piers were damaged by flooding and then demolished and removed from riverbed in 1998.
*Hutt Borough Council Pipe Bridge was constructed adjacent to the Akatarawa Bridge in 1913 to carry the Hutt Borough Council water supply pipes until decommissioned in 1958. It was damaged by flooding, and demolished in 1998 at the same time as the Akatarawa Bridge.
*Norbert Street Footbridge between California Park in Totara Park and Harcourt Park at the end of Norbert Street in Birchville.
*Maoribank Suspension Bridge was built in 1917, crossing at the bend in the river at the foot of Maoribank Cliff. The bridge was demolished in 1998, after the cliffside pier was damaged by flooding, making the bridge unsafe.
*Totara Park Bridge (Totara Park Road), a two-lane road bridge, opened about 1970 and provides access to the suburb of Totara Park.
*Moonshine Bridge (River Road/SH 2), a curved two-lane road bridge, was opened in 1987 as part of the River Road bypass of Upper Hutt. It replaced a road bridge slightly upstream of the current bridge.
*Silverstream Road Bridge (Fergusson Drive), a two-lane road bridge, carries a bulk water supply pipe, underslung on the north side, connecting Te Mārua water treatment plant with Porirua and Wellington City.
*Silverstream Rail Bridge (Wairarapa Line), a double-track rail bridge, opened in 1954 to replace the 1875 single-track rail bridge around 500 metres further downstream.
*Pomare Rail Bridge (Wairarapa Line), a double-track rail bridge, opened in 1954 as part of the Hutt Valley railway deviation.
*Kennedy-Good Bridge (Fairway Drive), a two-lane road bridge, opened in 1979 and was the first bridge at this site. The bridge is named after the Mayor of Lower Hutt at the time.
*Melling Bridge (Melling Link Road), a three-lane bridge opened 1957, with one eastbound lane and two westbound lanes. This is the second bridge at this site, the first being a one-lane suspension bridge opened in 1909, approximately 200 metres upstream.
*New Ewen Bridge is a single span arch bridge carrying four traffic lanes of traffic and footways. It is the seventh bridge at this site and was opened in 1996. The preceding bridges, which crossed nearer to Bridge Street, upstream of the latest bridge, were opened in 1844, 1847, 1856, 1872, 1904 and 1929.
*The Rail Bridge (Wairarapa Line) is a two-track rail bridge with pedestrian walkway. It was opened in 1927 with the then Hutt Valley Line to Waterloo.
*Waione Street Bridge (Hutt Estuary Bridge) is a two-lane road bridge opened in 1954, that carries a bulk water supply pipe connecting Waterloo and Wainuiomata water treatment plants with Wellington City.

<text>Oscar and Lucinda is a novel by Australian author Peter Carey. It won the 1988 Booker Prize the year it was released, and the 1989 Miles Franklin Award. It was shortlisted in 2008 for The Best of the Booker, in celebration of the prize&#x27;s 40th anniversary.

==Plot introduction==
The book tells the story of Oscar Hopkins, an Anglican priest from Devon, England, and Lucinda Leplastrier, a young Australian heiress, who are both traveling to Australia by ship. It explores their adventures on the large continent. 

They meet on a ship to Australia, where Lucinda has bought a glass factory, having long been fascinated by the material. Oscar had grown up as the son of a fundamentalist Brethren of Plymouth minister and naturalist. He has used his observation of nature as a sign from God for something less severe, and believes he has joined a more compassionate church with the Anglicans.

The travelers discover that they are both gamblers, one obsessive, the other compulsive. Lucinda bets Oscar that he cannot transport a glass church (which will be built by her factory in Sydney) from there to a remote settlement at Bellingen, some 400 km up the New South Wales coast. This bet changes both their lives forever.

==Inspiration==
A reviewer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that the novel was influenced by &quot;Father and Son&quot;, the autobiography of the English poet Edmund Gosse. The poet described his relation with his father, naturalist and minister Philip Henry Gosse. 

Carey also noted in his novel some material that he took directly from a book of natural history by the senior Gosse. He concentrates on visual descriptions and information, with glass as a major image and metaphor.

==Adaptation==

The novel was adapted years later for a film of the same name, released in 1997. It was directed by Gillian Armstrong and starred Ralph Fiennes, Cate Blanchett, and Tom Wilkinson.
