<text>Travertine ( ) is a form of terrestrial limestone deposited around mineral springs, especially hot springs. It often has a fibrous or concentric appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and rusty varieties. It is formed by a process of rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate, often at the mouth of a hot spring or in a limestone cave. In the latter, it can form stalactites, stalagmites, and other speleothems. It is frequently used in Italy and elsewhere as a building material. Similar (but softer and extremely porous) deposits formed from ambient-temperature water are known as &quot;tufa&quot;.

==Definition==
Travertine is a sedimentary rock formed by the chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals from fresh water, typically in springs, rivers, and lakes; that is, from surface and ground waters. In the broadest sense, travertine includes deposits in both hot and cold springs, including the porous, spongy rock known as tufa, and also the cave features known as speleothems (which include stalactites and stalagmites). Calcrete, which is calcium minerals deposited as a horizon in the soil profile, is not considered a form of travertine.

Travertine is often defined in a more narrow sense as dense rock, sometimes massive but more commonly banded or with a fibrous internal structure, deposited in hot springs. In this more narrow sense, travertine is distinct from speleothems and tufa. Travertine is sometimes defined by its mode of origin, as rock formed by inorganic precipitation of calcium carbonate minerals onto a surface following exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and groundwater. Calcrete, lake marls, and lake reefs are excluded from this definition, but both speleothems and tufa are included.

Fresh travertines vary widely in their porosity, from about 10% to 70%. Ancient ones may have porosities as low as 2% due to crystallization of secondary calcite in the original pore spaces, while some of the fresh aragonite travertine at Mammoth Hot Springs in Wyoming has a porosity greater than 80%. A porosity of about 50% is typical for cold spring travertine while hot spring travertines have a mean porosity of about 26%. Speleothems have low porosities of less than 15%.

==Landforms==
Travertine forms distinctive landforms:
* Spring mounds are domes of travertine ranging in height from less than a meter to over surrounding a spring orifice. Because the spring orifice is above ground level, the formation of terrestrial mounds requires either an artesian spring or a geyser. Travertine mounds also are found under water, often in saline lakes.
* Fissure ridges form from spring discharge along joints or faults. These can be over in height and in length. These generally show signs of progressive widening of the fissure, balanced by deposition of travertine on the fissure wall.
*Cascade deposits are formed by a series of waterfalls.
*Dam deposits are similar to cascades but have localized vertical buildup of travertine that creates a pond or lake behind the travertine buildup.
*Travertine forms various kinds of fluvial and lacustrine deposits.
*Paludal (marsh) deposits are shallow accumulations in poorly-drained areas.
*Speleothems are the characteristic &quot;formations&quot; of caves.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;travertine&#x27; is derived from the Italian , a derivation of the Latin meaning &#x27;of Tibur&#x27;, now known as Tivoli, near Rome, Italy.

==Geochemistry==
The formation of travertine begins when groundwater () containing an elevated concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide () comes in contact with limestone or other rock containing calcium carbonate (). The dissolved carbon dioxide acts as a weak acid, carbonic acid, which dissolves some of the limestone as soluble calcium bicarbonate ():

This is a reversible reaction, meaning that as the concentration of dissolved calcium bicarbonate builds up, the calcium bicarbonate begins to revert to calcium carbonate, water, and carbon dioxide. So long as there is nowhere for the carbon dioxide to go, chemical equilibrium is reached where dissolution of calcium carbonate is balanced by precipitation of calcium carbonate.

If the groundwater moves into an environment with a lower concentration of carbon dioxide (as measured by its partial pressure, pCO2), some of the carbon dioxide will escape into the environment, disturbing the equilibrium and allowing net precipitation of calcium carbonate to take place:

The calcium carbonate most readily precipitates onto solid surfaces bathed by the groundwater, eventually building up thick deposits of travertine. Because of the role of in dissolving and transporting calcium carbonate, it is sometimes described as the &quot;carrier CO2&quot; or simply as the &quot;carrier.&quot;

The most important sources of elevated carbon dioxide concentration in groundwater are soil and volcanic activity. Water passing through soil picks up carbon dioxide from plant roots and decaying organic matter. This is described as &quot;meteoric carrier,&quot; and the travertine formed by this mechanism as &quot;meteogene travertine&quot;. This is the principal mechanism for formation of speleothems. Groundwater with an enhanced concentration of absorbed from soil infiltrates underlying limestone, dissolving some of the limestone. When this groundwater then emerges into a cave with a lower concentration of , some of the escapes, allowing calcium carbonate to precipitate and build up stalactites, stalagmites, and other speleothems.

Volcanic activity is the source of carbon dioxide in groundwater that emerges from hot springs. When the water reaches the mouth of the spring, it rapidly loses carbon dioxide to the open air and precipitates calcium carbonate around the spring mouth. Travertine formed this way is described as &quot;thermogene travertine&quot;. This can form spectacular deposits of travertine, such as those of Pamukkale or Mammoth Hot Springs. The carbon dioxide may come from sources deep in the Earth, such as metamorphism of deeply buried rock. The carbon dioxide is carried to the surface by magma and is a major component of volcanic gases. Carbon dioxide may also be generated by magma bodies heating solid rock near the surface, through thermal decomposition of organic matter, or by reactions of quartz or other silica minerals with carbonate minerals.

Precipitation may be enhanced by factors leading to a reduction in pCO2, for example increased air-water interactions at waterfalls may be important, as may photosynthesis.

Rarely, travertine may form from highly alkaline water containing dissolved calcium hydroxide () produced during serpentinization of ultramafic rock. When this alkaline water reaches the surface, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the air to precipitate calcium carbonate:

While water carbonated by volcanic activity is usually associated with hot springs, such water occasionally cools to near ambient temperature before emerging at the surface. Likewise, water carbonated by passage through soil will occasionally have circulated to sufficient depths that it is quite warm when it reemerges at the surface. Water carbonated by volcanic activity will nonetheless tend to have a higher content of dissolved calcium bicarbonate and will generally be more enriched in the heavier 13C isotope.

Both of the major calcium carbonate minerals, calcite and aragonite, are found in hot spring travertines; aragonite is preferentially precipitated when temperatures are high, while calcite dominates when temperatures are lower. When pure and fine, travertine is white, but often it is brown to yellow due to impurities.

==Occurrence==

Travertine is found in hundreds of locations around the world. Only a sampling of notable occurrences is listed here.
 
Travertine is found at Tivoli, east of Rome, where the travertine has been quarried for at least 2,000 years. Tivoli travertine was deposited in a body in area and thick along a north-trending fault near the dormant Colli Albani volcano. The Guidonia quarry is located in this deposit of travertine. The ancient name for this stone was , meaning &quot;tibur stone&quot;, which was gradually corrupted to &quot;travertino&quot; (travertine). Detailed studies of the Tivoli and Guidonia travertine deposits revealed diurnal and annual rhythmic banding and laminae, which have potential use in geochronology. Deposits of travertine are found in about 100 other locations in Italy, including Rapalino near Pisa.

Cascades of natural lakes formed behind travertine dams can be seen in Pamukkale, Turkey, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other places with such cascades include Huanglong in Sichuan Province of China (another UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Mammoth Hot Springs in the United States, Egerszalók in Hungary, Mahallat, Abbass Abad, Atash Kooh, and Badab-e Surt in Iran, Band-i-Amir in Afghanistan, Lagunas de Ruidera, Spain, Hierve el Agua, Oaxaca, Mexico and Semuc Champey, Guatemala.

In Central Europe&#x27;s last post-glacial palaeoclimatic optimum (Atlantic Period, 8000–5000 BC), huge deposits of tufa formed from karst springs. On a smaller scale, these karst processes are still working. Important geotopes are found at the Swabian Alb, mainly in valleys at the foremost northwest ridge of the cuesta; in many valleys of the eroded periphery of the karstic Franconian Jura; and at the northern Alpine foothills.

Dinaric karst watercourses, especially those in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, are known for build-up of rich travertine deposits and associated phenomena such as tufa and travertine caves, river islets, barriers and waterfalls. In Bosnia and Herzegovina Una river is particularly rich in deposits, and so is Pliva, Trebižat, Buna, Bregava. Travertine has formed 16 natural dams in a valley in Croatia known as Plitvice Lakes National Park. Clinging to moss and rocks in the water, the travertine has built up over several millennia to form waterfalls up to in height. Also in Croatia the Krka, Zrmanja with Krupa tributary, and Kupa in Croatia and Slovenia, and Krka in Slovenia.

In the United States, the most well-known place for travertine formation is Yellowstone National Park, where the geothermal areas are rich in travertine deposits. Wyoming also has travertines in Hot Springs State Park in Thermopolis. Oklahoma has two parks dedicated to this natural wonder. Turner Falls, the tallest waterfall in Oklahoma, is a cascade of spring water flowing over a travertine cave. Honey Creek feeds this waterfall and creates miles of travertine shelves both up and downstream. Many small waterfalls upstream in the dense woods repeat the travertine-formation effect. Another travertine resource is in Sulphur, Oklahoma, east of Turner Falls. Travertine Creek flows through a spring-water nature preserve within the boundaries of the Chickasaw National Recreation Area. 

Austin, Texas, and the surrounding &quot;Hill Country&quot; to the south is built on limestone. The area has many travertine formations, such as those found at Gorman Falls within Colorado Bend State Park. Hanging Lake in Glenwood Canyon in Colorado was formed by travertine dams across a spring-fed stream. Travertine beds in the area are as much as thick. Rifle Falls State Park in Colorado features a triple waterfall over a travertine dam.

The Soda Dam Hot Spring system of the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico have been intensively investigated because of its connection to the geothermal system of the Valles caldera. Hot groundwater from the caldera has moved along the Jemez fault, and mixed with cooler groundwater before emerging at the surface. Radiometric dating of the travertines show that deposition began almost immediately after the Valles caldera eruption and that the area is experiencing deposition that began 5,000 years ago. A new species of the extremophile green algae &quot;Scenedesmus&quot; was first isolated from the travertine of Soda Dam.

In Iceland, the Hvanná river, located at the north flank of the Eyjafjallajökull, was heavily charged with CO2 following the 2010 eruptions. Travertine precipitated along the river.

==Uses==
Travertine is often used as a building material. It typically lacks planes of weakness, and its high porosity makes it light in weight for its strength, gives it good thermal and acoustic insulating properties, and makes it relatively easy to work. Dense travertine makes excellent decorative stone when polished.

The Romans mined deposits of travertine for building temples, monuments, aqueducts, bath complexes, and amphitheaters such as the Colosseum, the largest building in the world constructed mostly of travertine. In Italy, well-known travertine quarries exist in Tivoli and Guidonia Montecelio, where the most important quarries since Ancient Roman times can be found. The Tivoli quarries supplied the travertine from which Gian Lorenzo Bernini selected material from which to build the colonnade of St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome () in 1656–1667. Michelangelo also chose travertine as the material for the external ribs of the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Travertine from Tivoli was used in the sculpting of the majority of the Trevi Fountain in Rome during the Baroque period.

Travertine regained popularity as a building material in the Middle Ages. The central German town of Bad Langensalza has an extant medieval old town built almost entirely of local travertine. Twentieth century buildings using travertine extensively include the Sacré-Cœur Basilica in Paris, the Getty Center in Los Angeles, California, and Shell-Haus in Berlin. The travertine used in the Getty Center and Shell-Haus constructions was imported from Tivoli and Guidonia.

Travertine is one of several natural stones that is used for paving patios and garden paths. It is sometimes known as travertine limestone or travertine marble; these are the same stone, although travertine is classified properly as a type of limestone, not marble. The stone is characterised by pitted holes and troughs in its surface. Although these troughs occur naturally, they suggest signs of considerable wear and tear over time. It can be polished to a smooth, shiny finish, and comes in a variety of colors from grey to coral-red. Travertine is available in tile sizes for floor installations.

Travertine is one of the most frequently used stones in modern architecture. It is commonly used for indoor home/business flooring, outdoor patio flooring, spa walls and ceilings, façades, and wall cladding. The lobby walls of the modernist Willis Tower (1970) (formerly Sears Tower) in Chicago are made of travertine. Architect Welton Becket frequently incorporated travertine into many of his projects. The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center is clad with over 3 million pounds (about 1360 tonnes) of Ambra Light travertine from the Tivoli quarries. Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe used travertine in several of his major works, including the Toronto-Dominion Centre, S.R. Crown Hall, the Farnsworth House and the Barcelona Pavilion. The New Mexico State Capitol has its rotunda finished with travertine mined from a deposit west of Belen, New Mexico. Stone from this quarry is also used in buildings at the University of New Mexico.

==Supply==
Until the 1980s, Italy had a near-monopoly on the world travertine market; now significant supplies are quarried in Turkey, Mexico, China, Peru, and Spain. US imports of travertine in 2019 were 17,808 metric tons, of which 12,804 were from Turkey.

<text>In Sumerian and ancient Mesopotamian religion, gallûs (also called gallas; Akkadian &quot;gallû&quot; &lt; Sumerian ) were great demons or devils of the ancient Mesopotamian Underworld.

== Role in mythology ==

Gallu demons hauled unfortunate victims off to the underworld. They were one of seven devils (or &quot;the offspring of hell&quot;) of Babylonian theology that could be appeased by the sacrifice of a lamb at their altars.

The goddess Inanna was pursued by &quot;gallu&quot; demons after being escorted from the Underworld by Galatura and Kuryara. In the &quot;Descent&quot;, it is stated that said demons know no food, know no drink, eat no flour offering, drink no libation. They never enjoy the pleasures of marital embrace, never have any sweet children to kiss. They snatch the son from a man’s knee. They make the bride leave the house of her father in law.

== Other uses ==

The word &quot;gallu&quot; may also refer to a human adversary, one that is dangerous and implacable.

<text>Chernobog ( &quot;Black God&quot;) and Belobog ( &quot;White God&quot;) are an alleged pair of Polabian deities. Chernobog appears in Helmold&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; as a god of misfortune worshipped by the Wagri and Obodrites, while Belobog is not mentioned – he was reconstructed in opposition to Chernobog. Both gods also appear in later sources, but they are not considered reliable. Researchers do not agree on the status of Chernobog and Belobog: many scholars recognize the authenticity of these theonyms and explain them, for example, as gods of good and evil; on the other hand, many scholars believe that they are pseudo-deities, and Chernobog may have originally meant &quot;bad fate&quot;, and later associated with the Christian devil.

== Sources ==
In Latin records, this theonym is noted as and .

The 12th-century German monk and chronicler Helmold, who accompanied the Christianization missions to the Elbe Slavs, describes in his &quot;Chronicle of the Slavs&quot; the cult of Chernobog:

Belobog does not appear in any reliable sources – he was recreated in opposition to Chernobog.

=== Later sources ===
The next sources that speak of Chernobog and/or Belobog appear only in the 16th century. Around 1530, a Dominican friar from Pirna, Johan Lindner, recalls the gods in his compilation. Although he lived in or near the Lusatian region, he probably only used written sources and monastic stories, and not field research, which made many historians deem his work unreliable, including Georg Fabricius and Petrus Albinus. They believed that although his sources were numerous and varied, he used them uncritically. At the end of the 17th century, also mentioned the Chernobog in his list of the Lusatian gods. This information is also considered unreliable because it came into being late, when the Lusatian paganism was probably completely extinct and about half of the gods he mentioned are of Prussian origin.

In 1538, the Pomeranian chronicler Thomas Kantzow in his &quot;Chronicle of Pomerania&quot; wrote:
Then Sebastian Münster, in &quot;Cosmographiae universalis&quot; of 1550, describes the harvest ritual associated with Svetovit and continues: &quot;In general they (the Rugians) worshipped two gods, namely &quot;Belbuck&quot; and &quot;Zernebuck&quot;, as if a white and a black god, a good and an evil genius, God and Satan, as the source of good and evil, according to the error of the Manichaeans&quot;. The works of Kantzov and Münster are probably independent of each other (various forms of recording the name of the Belobog, the &quot;Chronicle of Pomerania&quot; was first published, but it was not published until the 19th century), but they use a common source, which, according to Miroslava Znayenko, could be the archive of the Abbey of , where the Belobog was forged. Daniel Cramer, a theologian and professor from Szczecin, probably held in his hands a copy of a chronicle from this archive or saw a quote from it, because in his &quot;Pommerisches Kirchen-Chronicon&quot; he probably paraphrased a part of it:
Chernobog also appears in the anonymous &quot;Historia Caminensis&quot; as the god of the Vandals, which is based on a work by Münster (both works speak of the &quot;error of the Manichaeans&quot;). Chernobog and Belobog also appear in other minor texts.

== Interpretations ==
There is no consensus in the academic community about the status of Chernobog and Belobog in Slavic mythology, or whether the two gods existed at all in Slavic mythology. Some researchers completely reject the existence of Belobog due to his non-appearance in the sources. At least four views have developed in scholarship:

# Chernobog is an epithet of Satan, and Belobog arose secondarily in later literature
# Chernobog and Belobog are Slavic deities (actual theonyms or epithets of other deities)
# Chernobog and Belobog are names of Christian figures with pre-Christian origin
# Chernobog and Belobog are pseudo-deities, they did not exist in either the Christian or pagan vocabulary

=== As deities ===
Helmold&#x27;s information led to the 19th century concept according to which there was supposed to be dualism in Slavic religion, which reached the Slavs from the Iranian peoples (Scythians, Sarmatians or Bogomils); Chernobog and the hypothetical Belobog were compared to Ahriman and Ormuzd, the eternal enemies in Zoroastrian mythology. In this spirit, Chernobog was interpreted by Alexander Hilferding. Later, Alexander Afanasyev and Alexander Famitsin considered the eastern counterpart of Belobog to be Belun (field spirit). None of these scholars, however, considered dualism an important element of Slavic religion; such a view was expressed only by in his amateur work (1872), but his work is not considered important. Franciszek Slawski, in his , reconstructed the Proto-Slavic &quot;*bělъ bogъ&quot; &quot;white, bright deity&quot; and Proto-Slavic &quot;*čŕ̥nъ bogъ&quot; &quot;black deity, dark deity&quot;, for the latter the main attestation is supposed to be Helmold&#x27;s account. Such dualism was advocated, for example, by Aleksander Gieysztor, Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov considered Chernobog to be a god who brings misfortune. Some authors have tried to prove the cult of Chernobog with the names of the &quot;Czorneboh&quot; and &quot;Bieleboh&quot; mountains in Upper Lusatia, where the gods are said to have been worshipped, but these names were not created until the modern era due to the popularity of the gods in the culture of those areas. When considering the authenticity of the gods, place names that are said to refer to Chernobog and Belobog are also mentioned as arguments, such as the village of in Russia or the village of in Ukraine, also the neighboring villages of &quot;Černíkovice&quot; and in the Czech Republic are said to be evidence of the authenticity of the cult of Chernobog and Belobog; however, the former actually comes from a personal name, likely of the founder.

=== As pseudo-deities ===
On the other hand, many researchers considered Chernobog merely a personification of bad luck, some mistake by Helmold or a pseudo deity in general. Andrzej Szyjewski considered Chernobog only a pejorative epithet for the devil, Stanisław Urbańczyk said:
His view was supported by Jerzy Strzelczyk. Chernobog was also supposed to be the personification of bad luck according to Martin Pitro and Petr Vokáč and Stanisław Rosik.

Aleksander Brückner negated the existence of Chernobog (and Belobog) in Slavic religion and claimed that Chernobog was created under the influence of Christianity, including medieval depictions of the devil as a black demon, and compared him to the alleged Prussian god &quot;Pikulas&quot;, which ultimately derives from the Polish word &quot;hell&quot;. The view was supported by e.g. Henryk Łowmiański.

An extended analysis of &quot;Chernobog&quot; and &quot;Belobog&quot; was made by Michał Łuczynski. He points out, first of all, that Slavic linguistic material makes it easy to conclude that words like &quot;black god&quot; and &quot;white god&quot; have a pan-Slavic range and a Proto-Slavic origin. The attestations of the &quot;black god&quot; are as follows: Slovincian &quot;čǻrnï bȯ́u̯g&quot; &quot;devil&quot;, Silesian &quot;evil spirit, devil&quot;, and toponyms: Russian , Ukrainian and Serbian ; the attestations of the &quot;white god&quot;: Slovincian &quot;bjǻu̯lï bȯ́u̯g&quot; &quot;God&quot;, Silesian &quot;a good, human-friendly deity; a good spirit&quot;, Serbian &quot;fate&quot;, Bulgarian &quot;luck, success&quot;, and toponyms: Czech , , Russian , , German , , and others. According to him, the above material leads him to assume that: the words &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; used in the expressions were used in their metaphorical sense, successively &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, and the word &quot;god&quot; was used in its abstract sense of &quot;fate, luck, fate&quot;. Accordingly, Proto-Slavic &quot;*čŕ̥nъ bogъ&quot; meant &quot;bad fate&quot;, and &quot;*bělъ bogъ&quot; &quot;good fate&quot; and this was their original meaning. Evidence of this etymology is provided by analogies, e.g. Polish , Serbian , , Croatian all meaning &quot;bad fate&quot;, &quot;black fate&quot;. Subsequently, these terms passed into personal names category and were used to describe God/Jesus and the devil as figures responsible for good fate and bad fate. Consequently, he considers Helmold&#x27;s Chernobog to be a pseudo-deity, which has been misidentified by modern scholars as a deity due to Helmold&#x27;s calque of &quot;black god&quot; and &quot;white god&quot; into Latin as &quot;niger deus&quot; and &quot;bonus deus&quot; which suggests that Slavic &quot;bog&quot; used in these terms = Latin &quot;deus&quot;, and personal names &quot;*Čŕ̥nobogъ&quot; &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;*Bělobogъ&quot; &quot;God/Jesus&quot; as semantic neologisms belonging to the Christian cultural circle, not pagan, as religious, not mythological terms, as may be further indicated by the toponymy (the Christian places of worship in Bielboh and Belovozhskiy monastyr).

== In popular culture ==
=== In Disney productions ===
An alternative version of Chernobog named Chernabog appears in the symphonic poem &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky. He is depicted as a giant winged demon summoning the souls of the dead. One segment of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940) was based on this work.

<text>In genetics, a deletion (also called gene deletion, deficiency, or [[Deletion anomaly|deletion]] mutation) (sign: Δ) is a mutation (a genetic aberration) in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is left out during DNA replication. Any number of nucleotides can be deleted, from a single base to an entire piece of chromosome. Some chromosomes have fragile spots where breaks occur, which result in the deletion of a part of the chromosome. The breaks can be induced by heat, viruses, radiation, or chemical reactions. When a chromosome breaks, if a part of it is deleted or lost, the missing piece of chromosome is referred to as a deletion or a deficiency.

For synapsis to occur between a chromosome with a large intercalary deficiency and a normal complete homolog, the unpaired region of the normal homolog must loop out of the linear structure into a deletion or compensation loop.

The smallest single base deletion mutations occur by a single base flipping in the template DNA, followed by template DNA strand slippage, within the DNA polymerase active site.

Deletions can be caused by errors in chromosomal crossover during meiosis, which causes several serious genetic diseases. Deletions that do not occur in multiples of three bases can cause a frameshift by changing the 3-nucleotide protein reading frame of the genetic sequence. Deletions are representative of eukaryotic organisms, including humans and not in prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria.

==Causes==
Causes include the following:
* Losses from translocation
* Chromosomal crossovers within a chromosomal inversion
* Unequal crossing over
* Breaking without rejoining

==Types==
Types of deletion include the following:
*Terminal deletion – a deletion that occurs towards the end of a chromosome.
*Intercalary/interstitial deletion – a deletion that occurs from the interior of a chromosome.
*Microdeletion – a relatively small amount of deletion (up to 5Mb that could include a dozen genes).

Micro-deletion is usually found in children with physical abnormalities. A large amount of deletion would result in immediate abortion (miscarriage).

==Nomenclature==
The International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) is an international standard for human chromosome nomenclature, which includes band names, symbols and abbreviated terms used in the description of human chromosome and chromosome abnormalities. Abbreviations include a minus sign (−) for chromosome deletions, and &quot;del&quot; for deletions of parts of a chromosome.

==Effects==

Small deletions are less likely to be fatal; large deletions are usually fatal – there are always variations based on which genes are lost. Some medium-sized deletions lead to recognizable human disorders, e.g. Williams syndrome.

Deletion of a number of pairs that is not evenly divisible by three will lead to a frameshift mutation, causing all of the codons occurring after the deletion to be read incorrectly during translation, producing a severely altered and potentially nonfunctional protein. In contrast, a deletion that is evenly divisible by three is called an &quot;in-frame&quot; deletion.

Deletions are responsible for an array of genetic disorders, including some cases of male infertility, two thirds of cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and two thirds of cases of cystic fibrosis (those caused by ΔF508). Deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 5 results in Cri du chat syndrome. Deletions in the SMN-encoding gene cause spinal muscular atrophy, the most common genetic cause of infant death.

Microdeletions are associated with many different conditions, including Angelman Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and DiGeorge Syndrome. Some syndromes, including Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome, are associated with both microdeletions and genomic imprinting, meaning that same microdeletion can cause two different syndromes depending on which parent the deletion came from.

Recent work suggests that some deletions of highly conserved sequences (CONDELs) may be responsible for the evolutionary differences present among closely related species. Such deletions in humans, referred to as hCONDELs, may be responsible for the anatomical and behavioral differences between humans, chimpanzees and other varieties of mammals like ape or monkeys.

Recent comprehensive patient-level classification and quantification of driver events in TCGA cohorts revealed that there are on average 12 driver events per tumor, of which 2.1 are deletions of tumor suppressors.

==Detection==

The introduction of molecular techniques in conjunction with classical cytogenetic methods has in recent years greatly improved the diagnostic potential for chromosomal abnormalities. In particular, microarray-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) based on the use of BAC clones promises a sensitive strategy for the detection of DNA copy-number changes on a genome-wide scale. The resolution of detection could be as high as &gt;30,000 &quot;bands&quot; and the size of chromosomal deletion detected could as small as 5–20 kb in length. Other computation methods were selected to discover DNA sequencing deletion errors such as end-sequence profiling.

==Mitochondrial DNA deletions==

In the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, the nuclear genes &quot;Rad51&quot;p, &quot;Rad52&quot;p and &quot;Rad59p&quot; encode proteins that are necessary for recombinational repair and are employed in the repair of double strand breaks in mitochondrial DNA. Loss of these proteins decreases the rate of spontaneous DNA deletion events in mitochondria. This finding implies that the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination is a step in the formation of mitochondrial DNA deletions.

<doc id="245189" wikidata="Q189574" url="?curid=245189" title="Menes">
<text>Menes ( ; ; , probably pronounced *; and Μήν) was a pharaoh of the Early Dynastic Period of ancient Egypt, credited by classical tradition with having united Upper and Lower Egypt, and as the founder of the First Dynasty.

The identity of Menes is the subject of ongoing debate, although mainstream Egyptological consensus inconclusively identifies Menes with the Naqada III ruler Narmer or his successor, the First Dynasty pharaoh Hor-Aha.

== Name and identity ==
The name &quot;Menes&quot; is first documented in the work of Manetho, an Egyptian historian and priest of the relatively late Ptolemaic period. Manetho noted the name in Greek as Μήνης ( &quot;Mênês&quot;). An alternative Greek form, Μιν ( &quot;Min&quot;), was cited by the fifth-century-BC historian Herodotus, but this variant appears to be unrelated, the result of contamination from the name of the god Min. The Egyptian form, &quot;mnj&quot;, is taken from the Turin and Abydos King Lists, which are dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty, whose pronunciation has been reconstructed as . By the early New Kingdom, changes in the Egyptian language meant his name was already pronounced . The name &quot;mnj&quot; means &quot;He who endures&quot;, which, I.E.S. Edwards (1971) suggests, may have been coined as &quot;a mere descriptive epithet denoting a semi-legendary hero [...] whose name had been lost&quot;. Alternatively, the name may conceal the collective identity of the Naqada III rulers: Ka, Scorpion II and Narmer, or may simply refer to a functional leadership role.

=== Narmer and Menes ===


The almost complete absence of any mention of Menes in the archaeological record and the comparative wealth of evidence of Narmer, a protodynastic figure credited by posterity and in the archaeological record with a firm claim to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, has given rise to a theory identifying Menes with Narmer.

The chief archaeological reference to Menes is an ivory label (from the town Naqada) which depicts the royal title &quot;Aha&quot; (the pharaoh Hor-Aha) next to a building, and within this is the royal title &quot;mn&quot;, generally taken to be Menes. From this, various theories on the nature of the building (a funerary booth or a shrine), the meaning of the word &quot;mn&quot; (a name or the verb &quot;endures&quot;) and the relationship between Hor-Aha and Menes (as one person or as successive pharaohs) have arisen.

The Turin and Abydos king lists, generally accepted to be correct, list the &quot;nesu-bit&quot;-names of the pharaohs, not their Horus-names, and are vital to the potential reconciliation of the various records: the &quot;nesu-bit&quot;-names of the king lists, the Horus-names of the archaeological record and the number of pharaohs in Dynasty I according to Manetho and other historical sources.

Flinders Petrie first attempted this task, associating &quot;Iti&quot; with Djer as the third pharaoh of Dynasty I, &quot;Teti&quot; (Turin) (or another &quot;Iti&quot; (Abydos)) with Hor-Aha as second pharaoh, and Menes (a &quot;nebty&quot;-name) with Narmer (a Horus-name) as first pharaoh of Dynasty I. Lloyd (1994) finds this succession &quot;extremely probable&quot;, and Cervelló-Autuori (2003) categorically states that &quot;Menes is Narmer and the First Dynasty begins with him&quot;. However, Seidlmayer (2004) states that it is &quot;a fairly safe inference&quot; that Menes was Hor-Aha.

Two documents have been put forward as proof either Narmer or Hor-Aha was Menes. The first is the &quot;Naqada Label&quot; found at the site of Naqada, in the tomb of Queen Neithhotep, often assumed to have been the mother of Horus Aha. The label shows a serekh of Hor-Aha next to an enclosure inside of which are symbols that have been interpreted by some scholars as the name &quot;Menes&quot;. The second is the seal impression from Abydos that alternates between a &quot;serekh&quot; of Narmer and the chessboard symbol, &quot;mn&quot;, which is interpreted as an abbreviation of Menes. Inconclusive arguments have been made with regard to each of these documents in favour of Narmer or Hor-Aha being Menes.

The second document, the seal impression from Abydos, shows the serekh of Narmer alternating with the gameboard sign (&quot;&quot;), together with its phonetic complement, the &quot;n&quot; sign, which is always shown when the full name of Menes is written, again representing the name &quot;Menes&quot;. At first glance, this would seem to be strong evidence that Narmer was Menes. However, based on an analysis of other early First Dynasty seal impressions, which contain the name of one or more princes, the seal impression has been interpreted by other scholars as showing the name of a prince of Narmer named Menes, hence Menes was Narmer&#x27;s successor, Hor-Aha, and thus Hor-Aha was Menes. This was refuted by ; but opinions still vary, and the seal impression cannot be said to definitively support either theory.

Herodotus, having mentioned &quot;Min&quot; as the first king of Egypt, wrote that &quot;Linus&quot;, or Egyptian &quot;Maneros&quot;, was &quot;the only son of the first king of Egypt&quot; and that he died untimely.

== Dates ==
Egyptologists, archaeologists, and scholars from the 19th century have proposed different dates for the era of Menes, or the date of the first dynasty:

* John Gardner Wilkinson (1835) – 2320 BC
* Jean-François Champollion (Published posthumously in 1840) – 5867 BC
* August Böckh (1845) – 5702 BC
* Christian Charles Josias Bunsen (1848) – 3623 BC
* Reginald Stuart Poole (1851) – 2717 BC
* Karl Richard Lepsius (1856) – 3892 BC
* Heinrich Karl Brugsch (1859) – 4455 BC
* Franz Joseph Lauth (1869) – 4157 BC
* Auguste Mariette (1871) – 5004 BC
* James Strong (1878) – 2515 BC
* Flinders Petrie (1887) – 4777 BC

Modern consensus dates the era of Menes or the start of the first dynasty between c. 3200–3030 BC; some academic literature uses c. 3000 BC.

== History ==
Ancient tradition ascribes to Menes to uniting Upper and Lower Egypt into a single kingdom and becoming the first pharaoh of the First Dynasty. Although Menes does not appear on extant pieces of the Royal Annals (Cairo Stone and Palermo Stone), his name appears in later sources as the first ruler of Egypt. Some sources credit him as directly inheriting the throne from the god Horus. He also appears in later dated king&#x27;s lists, always as the first human pharaoh of Egypt. Menes appears in demotic novels of the Hellenistic period, demonstrating that, even that late, he was regarded as an important figure.

Menes was seen as a founding figure for much of the history of ancient Egypt, similar to Romulus in ancient Rome. Manetho records that Menes &quot;led the army across the frontier and won great glory&quot;.

=== Capital ===
Manetho associates the city of Thinis with the Early Dynastic Period and, in particular, Menes, a &quot;Thinite&quot; or native of Thinis. Herodotus contradicts Manetho in stating that Menes founded the city of Memphis as his capital after diverting the course of the Nile through the construction of a levee. Manetho ascribes the building of Memphis to Menes&#x27; son, Athothis, and calls no pharaohs earlier than Third Dynasty &quot;Memphite&quot;.

Herodotus and Manetho&#x27;s stories of the foundation of Memphis are probably later inventions: in 2012 a relief mentioning the visit to Memphis by Iry-Hor—a predynastic ruler of Upper Egypt reigning before Narmer—was discovered in the Sinai Peninsula, indicating that the city was already in existence in the early 32nd century BC.

=== Cultural influence ===
Diodorus Siculus stated that Menes had introduced the worship of the gods and the practice of sacrifice as well as a more elegant and luxurious style of living. For this latter invention, Menes&#x27; memory was dishonoured by the Twenty-fourth Dynasty pharaoh Tefnakht and Plutarch mentions a pillar at Thebes on which was inscribed an imprecation against Menes as the introducer of luxury.

In Pliny&#x27;s account, Menes was credited with being the inventor of writing in Egypt.

=== Crocodile episode ===
Diodorus Siculus recorded a story of Menes related by the priests of the crocodile god Sobek at Crocodilopolis, in which the pharaoh Menes, attacked by his own dogs while out hunting, fled across Lake Moeris on the back of a crocodile and, in thanks, founded the city of Crocodilopolis.

Gaston Maspero (1910), while acknowledging the possibility that traditions relating to other kings may have become mixed up with this story, dismisses the suggestions of some commentators that the story should be transferred to the Twelfth Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III and sees no reason to doubt that Diodorus did not correctly record a tradition of Menes. Later, Edwards (1974) states that &quot;the legend, which is obviously filled with anachronisms, is patently devoid of historical value&quot;.

=== Death ===
According to Manetho, Menes reigned for either 30, 60 or 62 years and was killed by a hippopotamus.

== In popular culture ==
Alexander Dow (1735/6–79), a Scottish orientalist and playwright, wrote the tragedy &quot;Sethona&quot;, set in ancient Egypt. The lead part of Menes is described in the &quot;dramatis personæ&quot; as &quot;next male-heir to the crown&quot; now worn by Seraphis, and was played by Samuel Reddish in a 1774 production by David Garrick at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

In Hobby Japan&#x27;s &quot;Queen&#x27;s Blade&quot; media franchise, there is a character named Menace. Her name is a play on the ancient Egyptian ruler Menes. She is depicted wearing an outfit inspired by Ancient Egyptian fashion.

<doc id="245190" wikidata="Q3301848" url="?curid=245190" title="Mausoleum of Genghis Khan">
<text>The Mausoleum of Genghis Khan is a mausoleum dedicated to Genghis Khan, where he is worshipped as ancestor, dynastic founder, and deity. The mausoleum is better called the Lord&#x27;s Enclosure (i.e. shrine), the traditional name among the Mongols, as it has never truly contained the Khan&#x27;s body. It is the main centre of the worship of Genghis Khan, a growing practice in the Mongolian shamanism of both Inner Mongolia, where the mausoleum is located, and Mongolia.

The mausoleum is located in the Kandehuo Enclosure in the town of Xinjie, in the Ejin Horo Banner in the city of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, in China. The main hall is actually a cenotaph where the coffin contains no body (only headdresses and accessories), because the actual tomb of Genghis Khan has never been discovered.

The present structure was built between 1954 and 1956 by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in the traditional Mongol style. It was desecrated and its relics destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but it was restored with replicas in the 1980s and remains the center of Genghis Khan worship. It was named a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction by China&#x27;s National Tourism Administration in 2011.

==Location==
The cenotaph is located at an elevation of on the Gandeli or Gande&#x27;er Prairie about southeast of Xilian and about south of the county seat of Ejin Horo Banner, Inner Mongolia. It is the namesake of its surrounding banner, whose name translates from Mongolian as &quot;the Lord&#x27;s Enclosure&quot;.

The site is north of Yulin; south of Dongsheng; and from Baotou. There is a new interchange on highway 210 leading directly to the site.

== History ==

===Early sites===
After Genghis Khan died in or around Gansu on 12 July AD1227, his remains were supposedly carried back to central Mongolia and buried secretly and without markings, in accordance with his personal directions. His actual burial site remains unknown but was almost certainly not in Ejin Horo, which had only recently been conquered from the Tangut Empire. Without a body, the Mongols honored the khan&#x27;s memory and spirit through his personal effects. These ceremonies allegedly date to the same year as his death. Kublai Khan built temples for his grandfather&#x27;s cult in Daidu and Shangdu. Nine &quot;palaces&quot; for rituals concerning his cult were maintained by an imperial official in Karakorum.

After the fall of the Yuan in 1368, these permanent structures were replaced by portable mausoleums called the &quot;eight white yurts&quot; (&quot;naiman tsagaan ger&quot;). These had originally been palaces where the khan had lived, but were altered to mausoleums by Ögedei Khan. These yurts were first encamped at Avraga site at the base of the Khentii Mountains in Delgerkhaan in Mongolia&#x27;s Khentii Province.

===Ordos===
The shrine was entrusted to caretakers known as the Darkhad. Their leader was chosen from the Borjigin clan and was known as the Jinong since the first, Kamala, had been appointed King of Jin. The Darkhad moved from the Kherlen River to the Ordos, which took its name (Mongolian for &quot;palaces&quot;) from the mausoleum&#x27;s presence there. The caretakers oversaw commemorative and religious rituals and were visited by pilgrims. Mongol khans were also crowned at the yurts.

Under the Qing, 500 Darkhad were exempted from military service and taxation; the shrine also received 500 taels (about ) of silver each year to maintain its rituals. The site&#x27;s rituals became more local, more open to lower-class people, and more Buddhist.

The Mongolian prince Toghtakhutörü and the Darkhad built a permanent mausoleum in Setsen Khan Aimag in 1864. This traditional Chinese structure was described by a Belgian missionary in 1875 but was destroyed at the Panchen Lama&#x27;s suggestion in order to end an outbreak of plague among the Darkhad in early 20th century.

Around the fall of the Qing, the mausoleum became notable as a symbol for Mongolian nationalists. The Buryat scholar Tsyben Zhamtsarano advocated a removal of the shrine to northern Mongolia . After the Mongolian Revolution, a sacrificial rite was held for Genghis Khan to &quot;bring peace and safety to... human beings and other creatures&quot; and to &quot;drive out bandits, thieves, illness, and other internal and external malefactions&quot; in 1912. Some Mongolians planned to remove some of the ritual objects—particularly the Black Sülde, an allegedly magical heaven-sent trident—to the independent northern Mongolian territory from the Inner Mongolian shrine; in 1914, a letter from the Beijing office overseeing Mongolia and Tibet ordered Arbinbayar, the head of the Ihe Juu League, that
In 1915, Zhang Xiangwen ( &quot;Zhāng Xiāngwén&quot;, Chang Hsiang-wen) began the scholarly controversy over the site of Genghis Khan&#x27;s tomb by publishing an article claiming that it was in Ejin Horo.

During World War II, Prince Demchugdongrub, the notional leader of the Japanese puppet government in Mongolia, ordered that the mobile tomb and its relics be moved to avoid a supposed &quot;Chinese plot to plunder it&quot;. This was rebuffed by the local leader Shagdarjab, who claimed that the shrines could never be moved and locals would resist any attempt to do so. When he accepted Japanese weaponry to defend it, however, the Nationalist government became alarmed at the possibility of Japan using the cult of Genghis Khan to lead a Mongolian separatist movement. The yurts and their relics were to be removed to Qinghai either at their armed insistence or at Shagdarjab&#x27;s invitation. (Accounts differ.) The Japanese still attempted to use the cult of Genghis Khan to fan Mongolian nationalism; from 1941–4, the IJA colonel Kanagawa Kosaku constructed a separate mausoleum in Ulan Hot consisting of 3 main buildings in a estate.

===Gansu===
Once in Chinese hands, the relics did not go to Qinghai as planned. On 17 May 1939, 200 specially-selected Nationalist troops conveyed the relics to Yan&#x27;an, then the principal base of the Chinese Communists. Upon their arrival on 21 June 1939, the Communists held a large public sacrifice to Genghis Khan with a crowd of about ten thousand spectators; the Central Committee presented memorial wreathes; and Mao Zedong produced a new sign for it in his calligraphy, reading &quot;Genghis Khan Memorial Hall&quot; ( &quot;Chéngjísī Hán Jìniàntáng&quot;). As part of the Second United Front, it was allowed to pass out of the Communist controlled area to Xi&#x27;an, where Shaanxi governor Jiang Dingwen officiated another religious ritual before a crowd of tens of thousands on 25 June. (Accounts vary from thirty to 200,000.) Li Yiyan, a member of the Nationalists&#x27; provincial committee, wrote the booklet &quot;China&#x27;s National Hero Genghis Khan&quot; ( &quot;Zhōnghuá Mínzú Yīngxióng Chéngjísī Hán&quot;) to commemorate the event, listing the khan as a great Chinese leader in the mold of the First Emperor, Emperor Wu, and Emperor Taizong. A few days later, the Gansu governor Zhu Shaoliang held a similar ritual before enshrining the khan&#x27;s relics at the Dongshan Dafo Dian on Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong County. The Gansu government sent soldiers and a chief official for the shrine and brought the remaining Darkhad onto the provincial government&#x27;s payroll; the original 500 Darkhad were reduced to a mere seven or eight. Following this journey, the shrine remained there for ten years.

===Qinghai===
At the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist guard at the temple fled before the Communist advance into Gansu in the summer of 1949. Plans were put forward to move the khan&#x27;s shrine to the Alxa League in western Inner Mongolia or to Mount Emei in Sichuan. Ultimately, Qinghai&#x27;s local warlord Ma Pufang intervened and moved it west to Kumbum Monastery near his capital Xining, consecrating it with the help of local and Mongolian lamas under Ulaan Gegen. Following the Communist conquest of Xining a few months later, the Communist general He Banyan sacrificed three sheep to the khan and offered ceremonial scarves (&quot;hadag&quot;) and a banner reading &quot;National Hero&quot; ( &quot;Mínzú Yīngxióng&quot;) to the temple housing his shrine.

===Present-day mausoleum===
Ejin Horo fell to the Communists at the end of 1949 and was controlled by their Northwest Bureau until the establishment of Suiyuan Province the next year. The district&#x27;s Communists set up rituals honouring Genghis Khan in the early 1950s, but abolished the traditional religious offices surrounding them like the Jinong and controlled the cult through local committees with loyal Party cadres. Without the relics, they relied largely on singing and dancing groups. In 1953, the PRC&#x27;s central government approved the recently-formed Inner Mongolian provincial government&#x27;s request for 800,000 to create the present permanent structures. Early the next year, the central government permitted the return of the objects at Kumbum to the site being constructed at Ejin Horo. The region&#x27;s chairman Ulanhu officiated at the first ritual after their return, decrying the Nationalists for having &quot;stolen&quot; them. After this ritual, he immediately held a second ceremony to break ground on a permanent temple to house the objects and the khan&#x27;s cult, again approved and paid for by China&#x27;s central government. By 1956, this new temple was completed, greatly expanding the purview of the original shrine. Rather than having eight separate shrines throughout Ejin Horo for the Great Khan, his wives, and his children, all were placed together; a further 20 sacred and venerated objects from around the Ordos were also brought to the new site. The government also mandated that the main ritual would be held in the summer rather than in the third lunar month, in order to make it more convenient for the headers to maintain their spring work schedules. With the Darkhads no longer liable for personally paying for maintenance of the shrine, most accepted these changes. An especially large celebration was held in 1962 to mark the 800th anniversary of Genghis Khan&#x27;s birth.

In 1968, the Cultural Revolution&#x27;s Red Guards destroyed almost everything of value at the shrine. For 10 years, the buildings themselves were turned into a salt depot as part of preparations for a potential war with the Soviet Union.

Following Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Opening Up Policy, the site was restored by 1982 and sanctioned for &quot;patriotic education&quot; as a AAAA-rated tourist attraction. Replicas of the former relics were made, and a great marble statue of Genghis was completed in 1989. Priests at the museum now claim that all of the Red Guards who desecrated the tomb have died in abnormal ways, suffering a kind of curse.

Mongolians continued to complain about the poor state of the mausoleum. A 2001 proposal for its refurbishment was finally approved in 2004. Unrelated houses, stores, and hotels were removed from the area of the mausoleum to a separate area away and replaced with new structures in the same style as the mausoleum. The 150-million- (about $20 million) improvement plan was carried out from 2005 to 2006, improving the site&#x27;s infrastructure, expanding its courtyard, and decorating and repairing its existing buildings and walls. The China National Tourism Administration named the site a AAAAA-rated tourist attraction in 2011.

On 10 July 2015, 20 tourists aged 33 to 74—10 South Africans, 9 Britons, and an Indian—were detained at Ordos Ejin Horo Airport, arrested on terrorism-related charges the next day, and ultimately deported from China after they watched a BBC documentary about Genghis Khan in their hotel rooms prior to visiting the mausoleum. Authorities had considered it &quot;watching and spreading violent terrorist videos&quot;.

In 2017, the Genghis Khan Mausoleum averaged about 8000 visitors a day during its peak season and about 200 visitors a day at other times.

==Administration==
The site is overseen by the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Administration Bureau. It was headed by Chageder and then Mengkeduren in the early 2000s.

== Architecture ==
The present Genghis Khan Mausoleum Scenic Area stretches about , covering about in total. It consists of the Sulede Altar, the Sightseeing District for the Protection of Historic Relics, the Conservation District for Ecosystem Preservation, the Development-Restricted District of Visual Spectacles, the long Sacred Pathway of Genghis Khan between the entrance and the cenotaph, the long scenic pathway around the Bayinchanghuo Prairie, a Tourist Activity Centre, a Tourist Education Centre, the Sacrificial Sightseeing District, the Mongolian Folk Custom Village, the Shenquan Ecological Tourism Region, the Nadam Equestrian Sport Centre, and the Hot Air Balloon Club.

The tomb complex consists of the Main Hall, the Imperial Burial Palace, the Western Hall, the Eastern Hall, the Western Corridor, and the Eastern Corridor.

The Main Hall (正殿) is octagonal, high, and covers about . It is shaped like a flying eagle as a symbol of the khan&#x27;s bravery and adventurousness. Its plaque, reading &quot;Mausoleum of Genghis Khan&quot;, was written by Ulanhu in 1985. The site includes a high statue of Genghis Khan and two murals about his life, including a wall map of the extent of the Mongol Empire.

The Imperial Burial Palace (寢宮) or Back Palace (後殿) is high and covers about . It has three yurts with yellow silk roofs; the central yurt houses the coffins of Genghis Khan and one of his four wives and the side yurts house the coffins of his brothers. Genghis Khan&#x27;s coffin is silver decorated with engraved roses and a golden lock; weapons allegedly used by Genghis lie around it. There are also two other coffins for another two of his consorts. The site&#x27;s main altar lies in front of this yurt. The cenotaph and its placement are highly unusual in China, which usually follows Han principles like feng shui in the placement of tombs, employing mountains, rivers, and forests in the belief that this increases its spiritual power.

The Eastern Hall or Palace (東殿) is high. It holds the coffin of Tolui (Genghis Khan&#x27;s 4th and favourite son) and his wife Sorghaghtani.

The Western Hall or Palace (西殿) is high. It holds nine banners with holy arrows thought to house or connect with the soul of the Great Khan. They also represent 9 of Genghis&#x27;s generals. It also holds Genghis&#x27;s saddle and reins, some weapons, and some other objects like the khan&#x27;s milk barrel. All of the items currently displayed are replicas.

The high Eastern (東廊) and Western Corridors (西廊) connecting these halls are decorated with of murals about the lives of Genghis Khan and his descendants.

The site uses a five-colour scheme of blue, red, white, gold, and green to represent the multiethnic nature of Genghis Khan&#x27;s empire and also the sky, sun and fire, milk, earth, and prairie.

== Worship ==

Genghis Khan worship is a practice of Mongolian shamanism. There are other mausoleums dedicated to this cult in Inner Mongolia and Northern China.

The mausoleum is guarded by the Darkhad or Darqads (&quot;Untouchables&quot;), who also oversee its religious festivals, stop tourists from taking photographs, keep candles lit, and watch over the site&#x27;s keys and books. The 30 or so official Darkhad at the mausoleum are paid about 4000 a month for their services.

Mongols gather four times annually:
* 21st day of the 3rd month of the Mongolian calendar, the most important
* 15th day of the 5th lunar month
* 12th day of the 9th lunar month
* Goat Hide Stripes Ceremony on the 3rd day of the 10th lunar month

There is also a major ceremony in honor of the Black Sülde on the 14th day of the 7th lunar month.

They follow traditional ceremonies, such as offering flowers and food to Heaven (&quot;Tengri&quot;). The ritual sacrifice to the spirit of Genghis Khan was listed as national-level intangible cultural heritage in 2006, and the sacrifice to the Black Sülde was given similar status at the provincial level in 2007. After the ceremonies, there are Naadam competitions, primarily wrestling, horse-riding, and archery, but also singing.

==Performance==
The mausoleum complex is also hosts three plays concerning the khan and Mongolian culture: &quot;Proud Son of Heaven: Eternal Genghis Khan&quot;, &quot;The Mighty Genghis Khan&quot; (), or &quot;The Grand Ceremony of Genghis Khan&quot; (), and &quot;An Ordos Wedding Ceremony&quot; (). There is also an annual Genghis Khan Mausoleum Tourism Cultural Week.

<text>In number theory, a sphenic number (from , &#x27;wedge&#x27;) is a positive integer that is the product of three distinct prime numbers. Because there are infinitely many prime numbers, there are also infinitely many sphenic numbers.

==Definition==
A sphenic number is a product &quot;pqr&quot; where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; are three distinct prime numbers. In other words, the sphenic numbers are the square-free 3-almost primes.

==Examples==
The smallest sphenic number is 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, the product of the smallest three primes.
The first few sphenic numbers are
:30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154, 165, ... 

The largest known sphenic number at any time can be obtained by multiplying together the three largest known primes.

==Divisors==
All sphenic numbers have exactly eight divisors. If we express the sphenic number as formula_1, where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, and &quot;r&quot; are distinct primes, then the set of divisors of &quot;n&quot; will be:

:formula_2

The converse does not hold. For example, 24 is not a sphenic number, but it has exactly eight divisors.

==Properties==
All sphenic numbers are by definition squarefree, because the prime factors must be distinct.

The Möbius function of any sphenic number is −1.

The cyclotomic polynomials formula_3, taken over all sphenic numbers &quot;n&quot;, may contain arbitrarily large coefficients (for &quot;n&quot; a product of two primes the coefficients are formula_4 or 0).

Any multiple of a sphenic number (except by 1) is not sphenic. This is easily provable by the multiplication process at a minimum adding another prime factor, or raising an existing factor to a higher power.

==Consecutive sphenic numbers==
The first case of two consecutive sphenic integers is 230 = 2×5×23 and 231 = 3×7×11. The first case of three is 1309 = 7×11×17, 1310 = 2×5×131, and 1311 = 3×19×23. There is no case of more than three, because every fourth consecutive positive integer is divisible by 4 = 2×2 and therefore not squarefree.

The numbers 2013 (3×11×61), 2014 (2×19×53), and 2015 (5×13×31) are all sphenic. The next three consecutive sphenic years will be 2665 (5×13×41), 2666 (2×31×43) and 2667 (3×7×127) .

<doc id="245206" wikidata="Q747083" url="?curid=245206" title="Plus and minus signs">
<text>The plus sign () and the minus sign () are mathematical symbols used to denote positive and negative functions, respectively. In addition, the symbol represents the operation of addition, which results in a sum, while the symbol represents subtraction, resulting in a difference. Their use has been extended to many other meanings, more or less analogous. and are Latin terms meaning &#x27;more&#x27; and &#x27;less&#x27;, respectively.

The forms and are used in many countries around the world. Other designs include for plus and for minus.

== History ==
Though the signs now seem as familiar as the alphabet or the Hindu–Arabic numerals, they are not of great antiquity. The Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for addition, for example, resembled a pair of legs walking in the direction in which the text was written (Egyptian could be written either from right to left or left to right), with the reverse sign indicating subtraction:
Nicole Oresme&#x27;s manuscripts from the 14th century show what may be one of the earliest uses of as a sign for plus.

In early 15th century Europe, the letters &quot;P&quot; and &quot;M&quot; were generally used. The symbols (P with overline, , for (more), i.e., plus, and M with overline, , for (less), i.e., minus) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli&#x27;s mathematics compendium, , first printed and published in Venice in 1494.

The sign is a simplification of the (comparable to the evolution of the ampersand ). The may be derived from a macron written over when used to indicate subtraction; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter itself.
In his 1489 treatise, Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols and as &quot;minus&quot; and &quot;mer&quot; (Modern German ; &quot;more&quot;): . They were not used for addition and subtraction in the treatise, but were used to indicate surplus and deficit; usage in the modern sense is attested in a 1518 book by Henricus Grammateus.

Robert Recorde, the designer of the equals sign, introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in &quot;The Whetstone of Witte&quot;: &quot;There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more: the other is thus made − and betokeneth lesse.&quot;

== Plus sign ==

The plus sign () is a binary operator that indicates addition, as in 2 + 3 = 5. It can also serve as a unary operator that leaves its operand unchanged (+&quot;x&quot; means the same as &quot;x&quot;). This notation may be used when it is desired to emphasize the positiveness of a number, especially in contrast with the negative numbers (+5 versus −5).

The plus sign can also indicate many other operations, depending on the mathematical system under consideration. Many algebraic structures, such as vector spaces and matrix rings, have some operation which is called, or is equivalent to, addition. It is though conventional to use the plus sign to only denote commutative operations.

The symbol is also used in chemistry and physics. For more, see .

== Minus sign ==

The minus sign () has three main uses in mathematics:
# The subtraction operator: a binary operator to indicate the operation of subtraction, as in 5 − 3 = 2. Subtraction is the inverse of addition.
# The function whose value for any real or complex argument is the additive inverse of that argument. For example, if &quot;x&quot; = 3, then −&quot;x&quot; = −3, but if &quot;x&quot; = −3, then −&quot;x&quot; = +3. Similarly, −(−&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;.
# A prefix of a numeric constant. When it is placed immediately before an unsigned number, the combination names a negative number, the additive inverse of the positive number that the numeral would otherwise name. In this usage, &#x27;−5&#x27; names a number the same way &#x27;semicircle&#x27; names a geometric figure, with the caveat that &#x27;semi&#x27; does not have a separate use as a function name.

In many contexts, it does not matter whether the second or the third of these usages is intended: −5 is the same number. When it is important to distinguish them, a raised minus sign () is sometimes used for negative constants, as in elementary education, the programming language APL, and some early graphing calculators.

All three uses can be referred to as &quot;minus&quot; in everyday speech, though the binary operator is sometimes read as &quot;take away&quot;. In American English nowadays, −5 (for example) is generally referred to as &quot;negative five&quot; though speakers born before 1950 often refer to it as &quot;minus five&quot;. (Temperatures tend to follow the older usage; −5° is generally called &quot;minus five degrees&quot;.) Further, a few textbooks in the United States encourage −&quot;x&quot; to be read as &quot;the opposite of &quot;x&quot;&quot; or &quot;the additive inverse of &quot;x&quot;&quot;—to avoid giving the impression that −&quot;x&quot; is necessarily negative (since &quot;x&quot; itself may already be negative).

In mathematics and most programming languages, the rules for the order of operations mean that −52 is equal to −25: Exponentiation binds more strongly than the unary minus, which binds more strongly than multiplication or division. However, in some programming languages (Microsoft Excel in particular), unary operators bind strongest, so in those cases is 25, but is −25.

Similar to the plus sign, the minus sign is also used in chemistry and physics. (For more, see below.)

== Use in elementary education ==

Some elementary teachers use raised minus signs before numbers to disambiguate them from the operation of subtraction. The same convention is also used in some computer languages. For example, subtracting −5 from 3 might be read as &quot;positive three take away negative 5&quot;, and be shown as

:3 − −5 becomes 3 + 5 = 8,
which can be read as:
:+3 −1(−5)
or even as
:+3 − −5 becomes +3 + +5 = +8.

==Use as a qualifier==
When placed after a number, a plus sign can indicate an open range of numbers. For example, &quot;18+&quot; is commonly used as shorthand for &quot;ages 18 and up&quot; although &quot;eighteen plus&quot;, for example, is now common usage.

In US grading systems, the plus sign indicates a grade one level higher and the minus sign a grade lower. For example, (&quot;B minus&quot;) is one grade lower than . In some occasions, this is extended to two plus or minus signs (e.g., being two grades higher than ).

A common trend in branding, particularly with streaming video services, has been the use of the plus sign at the end of brand names, e.g. Google+, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+. Since the word &quot;plus&quot; can mean an advantage, or an additional amount of something, such &quot;+&quot; signs imply that a product offers extra features or benefits.

Positive and negative are sometimes abbreviated as and , and on batteries and cell terminals are often marked with and .

===Mathematics===
In mathematics the one-sided limit means approaches from the right (i.e., right-sided limit), and means approaches from the left (i.e., left-sided limit). For example, as but as .

When placed after special sets of numbers, plus and minus signs are used to indicate that only positive numbers and negative numbers are included, respectively. For example, formula_1 is the set of all positive integers and formula_2 is the set of all negative integers. In these cases, a subscript 0 may also be added to clarify that 0 is included.

===Blood===
Blood types are often qualified with a plus or minus to indicate the presence or absence of the Rh factor. For example, A+ means type A blood with the Rh factor present, while B− means type B blood with the Rh factor absent.

===Music===
In music, augmented chords are symbolized with a plus sign, although this practice is not universal (as there are other methods for spelling those chords). For example, &quot;C+&quot; is read &quot;C augmented chord&quot;. Sometimes the plus is written as a superscript.

== Uses in computing ==

As well as the normal mathematical usage, plus and minus signs may be used for a number of other purposes in computing.

Plus and minus signs are often used in tree view on a computer screen—to show if a folder is collapsed or not.

In some programming languages, concatenation of strings is written , and results in .

In most programming languages, subtraction and negation are indicated with the ASCII hyphen-minus character, . In APL a raised minus sign (here written using ) is used to denote a negative number, as in . While in J a negative number is denoted by an underscore, as in .

In C and some other computer programming languages, two plus signs indicate the increment operator and two minus signs a decrement; the position of the operator before or after the variable indicates whether the new or old value is read from it. For example, if x equals 6, then increments x to 7 but sets y to 6, whereas would set both x and y to 7. By extension, is sometimes used in computing terminology to signify an improvement, as in the name of the language C++.

In regular expressions, is often used to indicate &quot;1 or more&quot; in a pattern to be matched. For example, means &quot;one or more of the letter x&quot;. This is the Kleene plus notation. Hyphen-minus usually indicates a range ( - any capital from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;Z&#x27;), although it can stand for itself ( any capital from &#x27;A&#x27; to &#x27;E&#x27; or &#x27;-&#x27;).

There is no concept of negative zero in mathematics, but in computing −0 may have a separate representation from zero. In the IEEE floating-point standard, 1 / −0 is negative infinity (formula_3) whereas 1 / 0 is positive infinity (formula_4).

 is also used to denote added lines in  output in the or the .

== Other uses ==

In physics, the use of plus and minus signs for different electrical charges was introduced by Georg Christoph Lichtenberg.

In chemistry, superscripted plus and minus signs are used to indicate an ion with a positive or negative charge of 1 (e.g., NH). If the charge is greater than 1, a number indicating the charge is written before the sign (as in SO).

A plus sign prefixed to a telephone number is used to indicate the form used for International Direct Dialing. Its precise usage varies by technology and national standards. In the International Phonetic Alphabet, subscripted plus and minus signs are used as diacritics to indicate advanced or retracted articulations of speech sounds.

The minus sign is also used as tone letter in the orthographies of Dan, Krumen, Karaboro, Mwan, Wan, Yaouré, Wè, Nyabwa, and Godié. The Unicode character used for the tone letter () is different from the mathematical minus sign.

The plus sign sometimes represents in the orthography of Huichol.

In the algebraic notation used to record games of chess, the plus sign is used to denote a move that puts the opponent into check, while a double plus is sometimes used to denote double check. Combinations of the plus and minus signs are used to evaluate a move (+/−, +/=, =/+, −/+).

In linguistics, a superscript plus sometimes replaces the asterisk, which denotes unattested linguistic reconstruction.

In botanical names, a plus sign denotes graft-chimaera.

In Catholicism, the plus sign before a last name denotes a Bishop, and a double plus is used to denote an Archbishop.

==Alternative minus signs==

There is a commercial minus sign, , which is (or was) used in Germany and Scandinavia. The symbol , still used in many Anglophone countries as a division sign, is (or was) used to denote subtraction in Scandinavia.

The hyphen-minus symbol () is the form of hyphen most commonly used in digital documents. On most keyboards, it is the only character that resembles a minus sign or a dash so it is also used for these. The name &quot;hyphen-minus&quot; derives from the original ASCII standard, where it was called &quot;hyphen–(minus)&quot;. The character is referred to as a &quot;hyphen&quot;, a &quot;minus sign&quot;, or a &quot;dash&quot; according to the context where it is being used.

== Alternative plus sign ==
A Jewish tradition that dates from at least the 19th century is to write &quot;plus&quot; using the symbol , to avoid the writing of a symbol that could look like a Christian cross. This practice was adopted into Israeli schools and is still commonplace today in elementary schools (including secular schools) but in fewer secondary schools. It is also used occasionally in books by religious authors, but most books for adults use the international symbol . Unicode has this symbol at position .

<text>The Archdiocese of New York () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory or archdiocese of the Catholic Church located in the State of New York. It encompasses the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island in New York City and the counties of Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster, and Westchester to the north of the city. It does not include the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn or Queens, which are part of the Diocese of Brooklyn; however, the Diocese of Brooklyn is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of New York.

The Archdiocese of New York is the second-largest diocese in the United States by population, encompassing 296 parishes that serve around 2.8 million Catholics, in addition to hundreds of Catholic schools, hospitals and charities. The archdiocese also operates St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers, New York. The archbishop is also the metropolitan of the larger Ecclesiastical Province of New York.

The Good Newsroom is the digital news outlet of the archdiocese and includes a website, social media channels, an app, and a weekly e-newsletter.

The Reverend R. Luke Concanen was appointed the first bishop of what was then the Diocese of New York in 1808. As of 2024, the current archbishop of New York is Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Since 1911 every archbishop of the archdiocese has been elevated to the College of Cardinals, although such elevation is often deferred for a number of years.

== Prelature ==
The ordinary of the Archdiocese of New York is an archbishop whose cathedral is Cathedral of St. Patrick in Manhattan, New York. The archdiocese is the metropolitan see of the ecclesiastical province of New York, which includes the following suffragan dioceses:

* Albany
* Brooklyn
* Buffalo 
* Ogdensburg
* Rochester
* Rockville Centre 
* Syracuse

The ecclesiastical province includes all of New York State, except for Fishers Island, which is part of the Province of Hartford. As such, the metropolitan archbishop possesses certain limited authority over the suffragan sees of the province (see ).

==History==

=== 1784 to 1808 ===
On November 26, 1784, Pope Pius VI erected the Apostolic Prefecture of United States of America, creating a separate jurisdiction for the new United States from the Catholic Church of the United Kingdom. That same year, the new State of New York repealed the Colonial-era law prohibiting Catholic priests from residing in New York.

With the anti-priest law repealed, the French consul, Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, organized a group of laymen in 1785 to open St. Peter&#x27;s Parish in Manhattan, the first Catholic parish in New York City. The congregation purchased land for a new church from Trinity Church, supplement community donations with a gift of 1,000 silver pieces from King Charles III of Spain. The St. Peter&#x27;s Church was dedicated in 1787; its worshippers included Sister Elizabeth Ann Seton and the philanthropist Pierre Toussaint. In 1800, the congregation opened a school at St. Peter&#x27;s, the first Catholic school in New York.

On November 6, 1789, Pius VI raised the Apostolic Prefecture of United States to the Diocese of Baltimore, headed by the first American bishop, John Carroll. For the next nine years, Carroll was in charge of the Catholic Church in New York State along with the rest of the nation. The second Catholic church in New York State, and the first outside of New York City, was St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Albany, New York, founded in 1796.

=== 1808 to 1820 ===

On April 8, 1808, Pope Pius VII erected the Diocese of New York and three other dioceses, taking their territory from the Diocese of Baltimore. He simultaneously elevated the Diocese of Baltimore to a metropolitan archdiocese and assigned all four new sees as its suffragans. At the time of its formation, the Diocese of New York included:

* the entire State of New York
* Sussex, Bergen, Morris, Essex, Somerset, Middlesex, and Monmouth counties in northeastern New Jersey.

Pius VII appointed Monsignor R. Luke Concanen, then serving in Rome, as the first bishop of New York. However, he was prevented from sailing to New York by a French blockade. On Carroll&#x27;s recommendation, Concanen appointed Reverend Anthony Kohlmann, rector of St. Peter&#x27;s Parish, to administer the diocese as his vicar general. Kohlman traveled extensively throughout the new diocese, celebrating masses and providing sacraments to individuals. To relieve overcrowding at St. Peter&#x27;s, Kohlman started construction in 1809 of the original Cathedral of St. Patrick in Lower Manhattan. He also established the New York Literary Institution, the first Catholic school in the new diocese. Concanen died in Italy in 1810, having never made it to the United States.

On October 4, 1814, Reverend John Connolly was appointed the second bishop of New York by Pius VII. When Connolly arrived in New York, the diocese had four priests and three churches: St. Peter&#x27;s and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City, and St. Mary&#x27;s in Albany. The Catholic population of the diocese was approximately 15,000, primarily Irish with some English, French and Germans.

In 1817, Connolly invited the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg, Maryland, to open the first Catholic orphanage in New York City. During his tenure, Connolly traveled over 1,000 miles on horseback through the diocese. He spent a great deal of time ministering to Irish immigrants building the Erie Canal in Upstate New York. The first parish in Utica, St. John&#x27;s, was erected in 1819. In 1823, St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish was founded in Rochester, the first in that city. Connolly died on February 6, 1825.

=== 1825 to 1840 ===
To replace Connolly, Pope Leo XII in 1826 named Reverend John Dubois as the next bishop of New York. At the time of his consecration, the diocese had 18 priests, 12 churches and a Catholic population of 150,000. Dubois faced a primarily Irish Catholic population that was not happy over the Vatican appointing a French bishop. Desperately needing a seminary to prepare more priests, Dubois spent two years in Europe trying to raise funds. Back in New York, Dubois built his first seminary in Nyack in 1833, but it burned down the next year. He later opened another seminary in Lafargeville in northern New York. He also fought a long battle with the trustees of the first St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral over administration of that facility.

In 1837, at Dubois&#x27; request, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Reverend John J. Hughes as coadjutor bishop of New York to assist the ailing bishop. Unlike previous Catholic leaders in New York, Hughes did not try to build bonds with Protestant leaders and was very willing to fight for what he deemed as the rights of Catholics.

In 1840, Hughes started a campaign to persuade the Public School Society, which ran the public schools in New York City, to allocated seven schools for Catholic students and teachers. Hughes argued Catholics students in the existing schools were being forced to hear readings from the Protestant King James Bible. When the Society refused, he started lobbying the State of New York to subsidize Catholic schools.

In 1841, Hughes founded St. John&#x27;s College in the Bronx. Later to become Fordham University, St. John&#x27;s was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the Northeastern United States. Realizing that the Lafargeville seminary was too distant, Hughes that same year moved it to the new St. John&#x27;s campus. Despite Hughes&#x27; lobbying, the New York State Legislature passed the Maclay Act in 1842, which prohibited public funding of religious schools.

=== 1840 to 1850 ===

When Dubois died in 1842, Hughes automatically succeeded him as bishop of New York. Having lost the legal battle over public funding of Catholic schools, Hughes worked to establish a Catholic political party. One of his other priorities was to address parish debts and loosen the control of boards of trustees over these parishes. Hughes decided to found an independent Catholic school system in the city, staffed by members of religious orders. During his tenure as bishop, he opened over 24 schools. By 1870, 19 percent of the city&#x27;s children were attending Catholic schools.

The difficulties faced by Catholics at the time included anti-Catholic bigotry in general and in the New York school system and a strong Nativist movement that failed to keep Catholics out of the country but warned that control by &quot;the Papacy&quot; was a threat to American republicanism.

On April 23, 1847, Pope Pius IX erected the Diocese of Albany and the Diocese of Buffalo. This left the Diocese of New York with the following areas:

* New York City (then just Manhattan)
* Queens County, Richmond County, Bronx County, the City of Brooklyn and the two counties on Long Island
* Seven counties in New Jersey
* Seven counties in New York north of New York City

=== 1850 to 1885 ===

On July 19, 1850, Pius IX elevated the Diocese of New York to an archdiocese, making Hughes the first archbishop of New York. On July 29, 1853, to address the burgeoning Catholic population in New York and New Jersey, Pius IX created two new American dioceses:

* The Diocese of Newark, which took all the New Jersey counties from the new archdiocese
* The Diocese of Brooklyn, which took the City of Brooklyn, Queens County, and Long Island
At this point, the new archdiocese consisted of New York City, Richmond County and Bronx Counties, and the seven counties north of the city. In 1858, Hughes laid the cornerstone for the present St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan.

In July 1863, during the American Civil War, Hughes used his influence to help stop the Draft Riots in Lower Manhattan. They were started by Irish working men as a protest against conscription into the Union Army, but devolved into race riots that killed 119 African-Americans and resulted in the burning of many buildings. Very ill at the time, Hughes appeared on his balcony to address several thousand people, urging them to be peaceful and loyal to the United States. Other priests in Manhattan confronted mobs, stopping their rampages. Hughes died on January 3, 1864.

To replace Hughes, Pope Pius IX named Bishop John McCloskey in January 1865 as the second archbishop of New York. When the original St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was destroyed by fire in 1866, he rebuilt it in two years. McCloskey presided over the dedication of the present Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in 1879. In October 1880, Pope Leo XIII named Bishop Michael Corrigan as coadjutor archbishop to assist McCloskey.

In response to the growing Catholic population in New York, McCloskey established 88 new parishes, including the first parish for African-Americans along with new parishes for the Polish and Italian communities. The number of priests rose from 150 to 400 during his tenure. At the time of McCloskey&#x27;s death in 1885, there were 37,000 children enrolled at archdiocesan schools. He also established several charitable societies for children and a hospital for the mentally ill.

On July 25, 1885, Pope Leo XIII transferred the Bahamas to the Archdiocese of New York. The shipping connections between New York City and the islands made it easy for the archdiocese to administer them.

=== 1885 to 1900 ===

McCloskey died on October 18, 1885; Corrigan automatically succeeded him as archbishop.

During the 1886 mayoral campaign in New York City, Reverend Edward McGlynn, pastor of St. Stephen&#x27;s Parish in Manhattan, announced that he would speak at a political rally for the journalist Henry George, the candidate of the United Labor Party. Corrigan, who was very close to the Democratic political machine at Tammany Hall, had had previous conflicts with McGlynn over his political affiliations. He ordered McGlynn to cancel his speech. McGlynn delivered the speech anyway and Corrigan immediately removed him as pastor of St. Stephen&#x27;s. McGlynn was excommunicated by the Vatican in 1887.

In the 1880s, the Vatican became concerned that the Catholic hierarchy in the United States, dominated by Irish prelates, was neglecting the needs of the increasing numbers of Catholic Italian immigrants. The Vatican rebuked Corrigan in 1887 for neglecting the Italians and treating them in a humiliating way. The Irish parishes would only allow Italians to attend Mass in church basements. Corrigan refused to open Italian parishes, claiming that the Italians were &quot;not very clean&quot; and were too poor to support them.

Sister (and later Saint) Frances Xavier Cabrini arrived in New York in 1889 from Italy to establish an orphanage in Manhattan. When she met with Corrigan, he told her that he would not allow her orphanage and that she should return to Italy. Cabrini told him that, “I am here by order of the Holy See, and here I must stay.” At that point, Corrigan relented and invited Cabrini to work in the schools. He later allowed her to open an orphanage. In 1891, Corrigan started work on St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers.

=== 1900 to 1967 ===
By 1900, the archdiocese had over 55,000 students enrolled in its schools.
In 1902, after a fall at the St. Joseph&#x27;s construction site, Corrigan developed pneumonia and died. Leo XIII appointed Auxiliary Bishop John Farley on September 15, 1902, as Corrigan&#x27;s replacement as archbishop. Farley established nearly fifty new parochial schools within his first eight years as archbishop. After Farley died in 1918, Pope Benedict XV appointed Bishop Patrick Hayes on March 10, 1919, as archbishop. That same year, near the end of World War I, the Vatican named Hayes as the apostolic vicar of the Military Vicariate of the United States. This gave him jurisdiction to minister to American servicemen and women throughout the world. Succeeding archbishops of New York retained this position for the next few decades.

Pope Pius XI erected the Apostolic Prefecture of Bahama on March 21, 1929, starting its separation from the Archdiocese of New York. When Hayes died in 1938, Pope Pius XI appointed Auxiliary Bishop Francis Spellman on April 15, 1939, as archbishop of New York.

In 1949, the 240 gravediggers at the Catholic cemeteries in the archdiocese went on strike. After negotiations with the union broke down, Spellman led a group seminarians to dig the graves at one cemetery. Spellman eventually reached a settlement with the union.

During his long tenure as archbishop, Spellman raised over $500 million for the construction of schools, churches, and other institutions. During a five-year period in the 1950s, he constructed 15 churches, 94 schools, 22 rectories, 60 convents and 34 other institutions in the archdiocese. Spellman died of a stroke on December 3, 1967.

=== 1967 to 2000 ===

After Spellman&#x27;s death, Pope Paul VI named Auxiliary Bishop Terence Cooke as the seventh archbishop of New York on March 2, 1968. Cooke helped implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in the archdiocese, and adopted a more collegial management style than Spellman. During his tenure as archbishop, Cooke founded the following

* Birthright, an organization providing counseling and other support for pregnant women
* Inner-City Scholarship Fund, to provide financial aid for Catholic school students
* an archdiocesan housing development program for the poor
* &quot;Catholic New York&quot;, the archdiocesan newspaper
* nine nursing homes.

On October 6, 1983, Cooke died from leukemia. To replace him Pope John Paul II named Bishop John O&#x27;Connor on January 26, 1984. In 1986, the Vatican erected the Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA, removing jurisdiction for Catholic ministry to servicemen and women from the archbishop of New York. In 1990, O&#x27;Connor started the canonization process for Pierre Toussaint, the formerly enslaved man from Haiti who became a Catholic philanthropist in the 19th century.

=== 2000 to present ===

After O&#x27;Connor died on May 3, 2000, John Paul II appointed Bishop Edward Egan as archbishop on May 11, 2000. After the September 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan, Egan went to the disaster scene. He ministered to the injured and anointed the dead. He established a center for victims&#x27; families at the New School in Manhattan and an interfaith service at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. For retired priests, Egan established the John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor residence in 2003 at the previous site of the minor seminary in the Bronx.

On January 19, 2007, Egan announced the closure of ten under-utilized parishes and the merging of 11 other parishes. He also established five new parishes; three in Orange County, and one each in Staten Island and Dutchess County. He also approved building projects for nine parishes.

In 2008, the archdiocese celebrated the bicentennial of its establishment as a diocese. To mark the occasion, Pope Benedict XVI visited the archdiocese from April 18 to April 20, 2008. During his visit, Benedict visited St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, the United Nations, Ground Zero, St. Joseph&#x27;s Parish in Yorkville, and St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Yonkers. The pope also celebrated a mass at Yankee Stadium. When Egan retired on February 23, 2009, Benedict XVI named Archbishop Timothy Dolan as the 10th archbishop of New York.

Soon after his arrival in New York, Dolan oversaw a widely consultative pair of &quot;strategic planning&quot; processes, examining the archdiocese&#x27;s hundreds of grade schools (&quot;Pathways to Excellence&quot;, 2009–2013) and parishes (&quot;Making All Things New&quot;, 2010–2015). Ultimately, Dolan announced that dozens of underutilized schools and parishes would close or merge with others in their neighborhoods, due to decades-long trends of shifting populations, increasing expenses, declining attendance, and decreasing clergy. In November 2010, the archdiocese announced the closing of 32 schools.

In January 2024, Dolan announced that the archdiocese would move its offices from the Terence Cardinal Cooke Catholic Building in Manhattan to another location close to St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

As of April 2024, Dolan is the current archbishop of New York.

==Reports of sex abuse==
The archdiocese in 2017 announced that it was applying for a $100 million mortgage on the Lotte New York Palace Hotel, one of its properties in Manhattan, to pay victims of sexual abuse by its clergy who had not sued the archdiocese.

In August 2018, the archdiocese reported that between 2016 and 2018, its Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program paid nearly $60 million to 278 victims of sex abuse by clergy. On September 26, 2018, it was reported that the Archdiocese of New York, and the three other dioceses where Theodore McCarrick served as a bishop, were facing an investigation by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops for McCarrick&#x27;s alleged sex abuse. On January 28, 2019, the New York State Assembly and Senate passed a law allowing prosecutors to bring criminal charges until a victim turned 28, and permitting victims to sue until age 55. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill into law on February 14, 2019.

On April 26, 2019, the archdiocese released a list of 120 Catholic clergy accused of committing acts of sexual abuse. Some of those on the list, which included both male and female church workers, had been convicted of crimes and many others were deceased. Cardinal Dolan released a letter of apology, asking for forgiveness.

On August 14, 2019, James Grien, who accused McCarrick of sexually abusing him when McCarrick was an auxiliary bishop of New York, sued the archdiocese. In his lawsuit, Grien also stated that McCarrick&#x27;s status as a friend of his family allowed him to continue to visit and sexually abuse him after leaving the archdiocese in 1981.

On September 30, 2019, Dolan released a report written by Barbara S. Jones, a former judge and prosecutor. Her report stated that the archdiocese had completed the process of removing all of its remaining accused clergy from active ministry. In the same report, Jones recommended that the archdiocese also hire a sex abuse &quot;czar&quot; to vet all complaints. Jones, who was commissioned by Dolan in 2018 to conduct the review of the church&#x27;s handling of abuse allegations, also recommended hiring &quot;a compliance officer for the Office of Priest Personnel to monitor its functions and oversee the new document management system&quot;. Dolan also backed the Jones Report and stated at a press conference that the archdiocese was expanding its sex abuse policy as well.

On October 10, 2019, Pope Francis had accepted the resignation of Auxiliary Bishop John Jenik following an accusation of sex abuse. Appointed auxiliary bishop by Francis in 2014, Jenik also served as vicar for the Northwest Bronx, appointed by Dolan&#x27;s predecessor Edward Egan in 2006. Jenik, who had submitted his resignation letter upon turning 75 in March 2019, had been out of public ministry since October 2018 after the allegation surfaced.

On May 8, 2020, Cuomo extended the 2019 New York Child Victim Act&#x27;s statute of limitations deadline to file sex abuse lawsuits. Originally set for August 14, 2020, it was changed to January 14, 2021.

On July 27, 2020, it was revealed that a Catholic priest who served in Orange County was named in a new sex abuse lawsuit. Eight men alleged that Reverend George Boxelaar, who died in 1990, sexually abused them when they were children during the 1970s and 1980s. They added their claims to three other alleged victims of Boxelaar. In addition to these new lawsuits, a Scarsdale Catholic school teacher identified as Edwin Gaylor also confessed to committing acts of sex abuse.

On December 3, 2020, Reverend George Rutler, pastor of the Church of St. Michael in Manhattan, was accused by a female security guard of watching pornography and &quot;aggressively&quot; groping her. Rutler denied the charges and offered to temporarily step down as pastor. In May 2021, the District Attorney of Manhattan declined to bring charges against Rutler, dismissing the accusations as &quot;baseless.&quot;

<text>St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedralis a Catholic cathedral in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It is the seat of the Archbishop of New York as well as a parish church. The cathedral occupies a city block bounded by Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, 50th Street, and 51st Street, directly across from Rockefeller Center. Designed by James Renwick Jr., it is the largest Gothic Revival Catholic cathedral in North America.

The cathedral was constructed starting in 1858 to accommodate the growing Archdiocese of New York and to replace St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral. Work was halted in the early 1860s during the American Civil War; the cathedral was completed in 1878 and dedicated on May 25, 1879. The archbishop&#x27;s house and rectory were added in the early 1880s, both designed by James Renwick Jr., and the spires were added in 1888. A Lady chapel designed by Charles T. Mathews was constructed from 1901 to 1906. The cathedral was consecrated on October 5, 1910, after all its debt had been paid off. Extensive restorations of the cathedral were conducted several times, including in the 1940s, 1970s, and 2010s.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is clad in marble and has several dozen stained glass windows. It measures long, with a maximum width of at the transepts. The bronze doors that form the cathedral&#x27;s main entrance on Fifth Avenue are flanked by towers with spires rising . The northern tower contains nineteen bells, and the interior has two pipe organs. Inside is a nave flanked by several chapels; two transepts; a chancel and apse; and a crypt. East of the apse are the rectory, Lady chapel, and archbishop&#x27;s residence facing Madison Avenue. The cathedral is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
The Diocese of New York was founded by Pope Pius VII in 1808. St. Patrick&#x27;s was founded shortly afterward to serve New York City&#x27;s small, but growing, Catholic population, which could no longer fit in St. Peter&#x27;s Church. A site was selected on Mulberry Street in what is now Lower Manhattan, and St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral was dedicated in 1815. At the time, there were 15,000 Catholics in the diocese.

=== Early site history ===
In March 1810, the Rev. Father Anthony Kohlmann bought the land on which the present cathedral stands. The site was bounded by what is now Fifth Avenue on the west, 51st Street on the north, Madison Avenue to the east, and 50th Street on the south. The Jesuit community built a college on the site, which at the time was north of New York City proper. It contained a &quot;fine old house&quot; which was fitted with a chapel of St. Ignatius. In 1813, the Jesuits sold the lot to the Diocese of New York. The school closed in 1814 and the diocese gave the property to Dom Augustin LeStrange, the abbot of a community of Trappists who were fleeing persecution by French authorities. In addition to a small monastic community, they looked after orphans. With the downfall of Napoleon, the Trappists returned to France in 1815, but the neighboring orphanage was maintained by the diocese into the late nineteenth century.

In 1828, trustees of St. Patrick&#x27;s, St. Peter&#x27;s, and St. Mary&#x27;s met to discuss the feasibility of establishing a burial ground at Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. The trustees bought the property in 1829 but did not use it as a cemetery. Bishop John Dubois reopened the chapel in 1840 for Catholics employed at the Deaf and Dumb Asylum and in the general neighborhood. A modest frame church was built for the parish of St. John the Evangelist and dedicated in 1841 by the Rev. John Hughes, administrator of the diocese. Tickets were sold to the dedication to ease the parish&#x27;s debt, but the mortgage was foreclosed upon, and in 1844 the church was sold at auction. The church&#x27;s pastor, the Rev. Felix Larkin, was said to have died from stress as a result. The Rev. Michael A. Curran was appointed to raise funds for the devastated parish and used an old college hall as a temporary church. Curran continued raising funds to buy back the church during the Great Famine in Ireland, eventually succeeding and taking the deed in his own name.

===Planning===
By the early 1840s, the number of Catholics in the Diocese of New York had increased to 200,000. As a result, several additional dioceses were created in New York state. Most of New York state&#x27;s Catholics at the time were Irish. The Diocese of New York was made an archdiocese by Pope Pius IX on July 19, 1850. Bishop John Joseph Hughes was raised to the level of archbishop soon afterward. As early as 1850, Hughes determined that the growing Archdiocese of New York needed a large cathedral to replace the older cathedral in Lower Manhattan. At the time, the Fifth Avenue site was still relatively rural. The site faced the gardens of Columbia University to the west, but the surrounding area was otherwise characterized by rocks and unopened streets. Even so, Hughes believed the site would grow into a populous business area.

In 1853, Hughes announced that he had hired the firm Renwick &amp; Rodrigue to design a cathedral on Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets. One partner in the firm, William Rodrigue, was Hughes&#x27;s brother-in-law. The other partner, James Renwick Jr., was largely responsible for designing the new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Renwick spent three years in Europe to look for design influences for New York City&#x27;s new Catholic cathedral. He took particular inspiration from the unfinished Cologne Cathedral. Renwick &amp; Rodrigue originally planned a larger cathedral than the structure that was ultimately built. Hughes requested in 1857 that the firm reduce the dimensions of the new cathedral. To make way for the clergy&#x27;s and archbishop&#x27;s residences, the ambulatory was removed from the plans. The area behind the apse would have contained a chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, but this was removed entirely. The numerous heavy buttresses in the design were also removed.

Plans for the cathedral were finalized in 1858. To raise money for the effort, Hughes asked wealthy Catholics in the Archdiocese of New York to subscribe to a building fund for the new cathedral. One hundred and three subscribers donated $1,000 apiece, and two subscribers were non-Catholics. The first construction contracts for the new Fifth Avenue cathedral were issued in June 1858. The new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was to take up the entire block bounded by Fifth and Madison Avenues between 50th and 51st Streets. The front facade on Fifth Avenue would have three large entrances, and the northwest and southwest corners of the cathedral would be topped by an octagonal spire. The interior was to be designed in a cruciform layout. The cathedral was to be built in the Gothic Revival style. In addition, an archbishop&#x27;s house and a chapel would face Madison Avenue. At the time, there were numerous hospitals, asylums, and other public institutions along the nearby section of Fifth Avenue.

=== Construction ===

==== Initial work and hiatus ====
On August 15, 1858, the cornerstone was laid just south of the diocese&#x27;s orphanage. Archbishop Hughes laid the cornerstone in front of 100,000 spectators near the intersection of Fifth Avenue and 50th Street, though the precise location remains unclear. That October, the architects presented cost estimates for making the cathedral out of white marble, brown freestone, olive freestone, or granite. The white marble was the most expensive of the four options, with a projected cost of $850,000, and James Hall and William Joyce offered to supply the marble. Even so, Renwick recommended that St. Patrick&#x27;s be constructed of white marble, citing its durability and beauty. The archdiocese formed a Bureau of Contracts, which first met in December 1858.

The bureau awarded the marble contract to Hall and Joyce in March 1859; at the time, the work was supposed to be finished before January 1, 1867. The cost estimate of $867,500 for the entire cathedral () was unusually low for a project of that size. Construction progressed for two years after the cornerstone was laid. The work consisted of laying stone blocks for the foundation, each weighing between one and four tons. The foundation was excavated to a maximum depth of , where it was laid on solid rock. The excavations were relatively small because the underlying layer of bedrock was shallow, rising nearly to the surface near the transept on Fifth Avenue. White-marble walls were then constructed above the foundation. By January 1860, the cathedral had been erected to about above ground level. Work was slightly delayed by a stonecutters&#x27; strike that March.

The walls had reached the water table when all $73,000 in funds had been exhausted. As a result, in August 1860, Hughes decided to suspend all work on the new cathedral. When work was suspended, the walls had been built to an average height of above ground. The onset of the American Civil War in 1861 prevented the resumption of work for several years. Hughes died in January 1864 before the work could resume. John McCloskey was appointed to succeed Hughes as archbishop. McCloskey created a plan to finance the construction of the new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

==== Completion ====
By mid-1866, work had again resumed and the walls had been built to above ground. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; reported that the interior &quot;looks like a large field&quot; and said the cathedral would be &quot;worthy to be regarded as one of the wonders of the Republic&quot;. Some $100,000 was spent on the Catholic cathedral in 1867, and the constituent churches of the Archdiocese of New York promised to spend $100,000 a year until the cathedral was complete. Most funding for the cathedral came from the parishioners of these churches, who were mainly poor Irish immigrants. An editorial in the &quot;New York World&quot; described the cathedral as being constructed &quot;not of the superfluity of wealth, but for the most part out of the offerings of poverty&quot;.

The cathedral&#x27;s masonry was laid during summer as the stonework could not be laid in the cold. By late 1870, the marble walls had been built to a height of and the transept was finished. The entrance on Fifth Avenue, measuring tall, had also been finished. Over a hundred workers were busy quarrying marble from Pleasantville, north of New York City. The marble was transported down to New York City via the Harlem Railroad, where a branch track led to the new cathedral&#x27;s site. The construction of the new cathedral drew relatively little interest for New York City&#x27;s non-Catholic population, though several commentators praised the cathedral&#x27;s design. An anonymous author for the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; wrote that the new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was the &quot;most gorgeous ecclesiastical edifice on this continent&quot;, though the critics perceived the buttresses on the north and south sides of the facade as &quot;altogether unnecessary&quot;. A reporter for the &quot;New York World&quot;, probably Montgomery Schuyler, wrote in 1871 that the cathedral would be &quot;one of the leading ecclesiastical structures in the world&quot;.

The trustees of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral borrowed $300,000 from the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank for the new cathedral in 1874. The trustees gave the bank a first mortgage on the cathedral and site as collateral for the loan. By late 1875, the roof had been covered with slate and all of the walls were finished, except for a small portion along Fifth Avenue. The trustees borrowed another $100,000 from the Emigrant Bank in 1876. Late that year, temporary scaffolding was erected so the interior could be plastered and decorated. Almost all the stained glass had been delivered and was being glazed; four of these windows had been exhibited at the Centennial Exposition. Only one worker had been killed during the construction process, according to the &quot;American Architect and Building News,&quot; due to his own carelessness. McCloskey made contracts for furnishings in 1874 and again in 1878.

On November 29, 1877, the incomplete St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was opened for public viewing. A one-month-long fundraiser for the cathedral commenced on October 22, 1878. In its first three weeks, the fundraiser had an average daily attendance of between ten and eleven thousand. The fair ran for 36 nights and attracted about 250,000 total visitors when it closed on November 30. Forty-five parishes of the Archdiocese of New York had exhibits at the fair. The fundraiser sought to raise $200,000 for the cathedral, but it ultimately netted $173,000. Several months elapsed before the cathedral was readied for its dedication in early 1879.

=== Opening and late 19th century ===

The new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral opened on May 25, 1879. Thirty-five bishops and six archbishops attended the dedication. St. Patrick&#x27;s was met with a generally positive reception from the media. The &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, for example, called it the &quot;finest church edifice on the American continent&quot;. Not all critics spoke of the cathedral positively; journalist Clarence Cook authored a criticism that architectural historian Robert A. M. Stern characterized as being &quot;underpinned with religious and ethnic bigotry&quot;. Cook perceived the facade as being full of &quot;clumsy repetition&quot;, and he wrote of the interior: &quot;Words cannot express the paltry character of the internal finish of this vaunted structure.&quot; The new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and Temple Emanu-El comprised the first non-Protestant houses of worship on the midtown section of Fifth Avenue. At the time, the cathedral was far removed from the developed portions of the city. The first bishop consecrated in the new cathedral was the Michael J. O&#x27;Farrell of Trenton, New Jersey, who became the first bishop of the Diocese of Trenton.

The cathedral&#x27;s parish originally extended from Seventh Avenue to the East River between 46th and 59th Streets, and the section between Madison and Sixth Avenues extended to 42nd Street. In 1880, the section between Third Avenue and the East River was split to the parish of St. John the Evangelist. During the early 1880s, Renwick designed the archbishop&#x27;s house and rectory on Madison Avenue. The &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; reported in December 1881 that Renwick had been hired to build a rectory at the southwest corner of Madison Avenue and 51st Street. Shortly afterward, Renwick filed plans for a four-story marble rectory on the site, to be built by E. D. Connoly &amp; Son and P. Walsh. The archbishop&#x27;s house was completed the same year. The rectory was completed on May 8, 1884. A critic for the &quot;Real Estate Record&quot; characterized the rectory and archbishop&#x27;s house as having &quot;absurd&quot; dormer windows in their mansard roofs. A memorial marble pulpit was manufactured in Italy and installed in the cathedral in October 1885. The money for the pulpit came from the clergy of the archdiocese, who had offered Cardinal McCloskey $10,000 for his golden jubilee and commissioned the pulpit after he had declined the prize.

A lack of funding precluded spires from being installed when the cathedral was completed. By late 1885, spires were planned to be installed at a cost of $190,000. Renwick filed plans for the cathedral spires in September 1885, and the contract was awarded to George Mann &amp; Co. of Baltimore. Excavation of the stone commenced in January 1886 and the spires were constructed starting that September. The last stones of the spires were erected in October 1888, at which point the cathedral was considered completed. At the time several hundred niches remained to be filled with figures, and ten chapels did not have their altars yet. At , the spires were the tallest structures in New York City. &quot;The Evening World&quot; said the construction of the spires &quot;completes a notable ornament to the city&quot;. Within a year, the cathedral was surpassed in height by the New York World Building, whose spire rose to . The funding shortages at the building&#x27;s completion had also required that a &quot;temporary&quot; plaster and wood ceiling be installed atop the cathedral, rather than the marble or brick ceiling that Renwick had conceived. The cathedral never replaced the plaster-and-wood ceiling.

After the spires were finished, the trustees of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral decided that bells should be installed in one tower. No arrangements had yet been made for the bells because parts of the project, such as interior design, remained incomplete. The cathedral tested a set of four bells in the north tower in July and August 1889 to determine the tower&#x27;s acoustic properties. The altar of the Holy Family was consecrated at the cathedral in 1893. A set of bells for the cathedral was manufactured in the United States. After the archbishop consecrated them, the bells were found to be defective and were never hung in the belfry. In 1895, the cathedral ordered a second set of bells to be made by the Paccards in France. The new bells were blessed by Archbishop Michael Corrigan on August 15, 1897, though they had not been installed yet. The framework for the bells was installed in the north tower the next month. At the time of completion, St. Patrick&#x27;s had more bells than any other church in the city, with 19; by comparison, Trinity Church had ten bells and Grace Church had nine. Also in 1897, the Spiritual Sons of De La Salle funded a new altar for the cathedral.

=== 20th century ===

==== Lady chapel and consecration ====
Margaret A. Kelly, widow of banker Eugene Kelly, died in 1899 and left $200,000 to the cathedral for the construction of a Lady chapel, on the condition that the chapel not be constructed until after her death. Kelly&#x27;s sons pledged additional funds for the chapel as necessary. The next year, the trustees of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral held an architectural design competition for the chapel, east of the cathedral&#x27;s apse. The trustees received submissions from American, Canadian, French, and British architects before giving the commission to Charles T. Mathews of New York City. After traveling to Europe to study architectural influences, Mathews prepared plans for the chapel by September 1900. Work on the Lady chapel began in July 1901.

Archbishop Corrigan was simultaneously paying off the debt on the cathedral with the intention of consecrating it after all the debts were paid off in 1908. This date was the centennial of the Archdiocese of New York&#x27;s founding and the 50-year anniversary of the groundbreaking ceremony. However, he died in 1902 before the consecration or the retirement of the debt. Following a construction delay of more than one year, the Lady chapel was nearly complete by early 1905. The first Mass in the Lady chapel took place in Christmas 1906, but the interior furnishings were not complete until 1908. The chapel cost $800,000 in total.

Additional changes to the cathedral took place in the first decade of the 20th century. These included the construction of an altar to St. Michael on the left side of the Lady chapel, as well as an altar to St. Joseph on the right side. By 1907, a movable bronze screen was to be installed at the transept, and the temporary wooden floor dating from the cathedral&#x27;s construction was planned to be replaced with a permanent marble floor. The bronze screens were a gift to celebrate the archdiocese&#x27;s centennial, which almost every archbishop in the United States celebrated at the cathedral in April 1908. The Lady chapel was originally outfitted with transparent windows, though its stained-glass windows were manufactured in Europe starting in 1909. In the first half of 1910, the cathedral&#x27;s debt of $800,000 was completely paid off. St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was consecrated on October 5, 1910, with Archbishop John Murphy Farley officiating. By that time, the surrounding area was quickly being developed.

==== 1920s through 1940s ====
Monsignor Michael J. Lavelle started raising $625,000 from the congregation in 1926 to renovate the cathedral. The next year, Robert J. Reiley was hired to conduct renovations, including replacing the wooden floor with a marble floor. The floor was replaced between April and December 1927. The old organ was also replaced and new stained-glass windows, altar, and pews were being installed in the Lady chapel. The sanctuary was extended approximately , the metal communion rail was replaced with a bronze and marble rail, and the wooden throne was replaced with one of marble. Amplifiers, wrought-iron doors, and new bronze chandeliers were installed. New pews were also installed, as were two new organs. English stained glass artist and designer Paul Vincent Woodroffe completed the Lady chapel&#x27;s remaining windows by late 1930. With the construction of Rockefeller Center to the west, several trees were planted around the cathedral in 1939 to complement Rockefeller Center&#x27;s trees.

The cathedral&#x27;s rectory was closed in April 1940 for the first major renovation in its history, and it reopened that December. Archbishop Francis Spellman announced in February 1941 that an anonymous donor had provided funding for a new high altar, to be designed by Charles Maginnis. According to Spellman&#x27;s announcement, the original high altar had been &quot;architecturally inconsistent&quot; with the cathedral&#x27;s design ever since the Lady chapel was completed, but a lack of funds had prevented the altar&#x27;s replacement for four decades. The reredos behind the original high altar blocked the view of the Lady chapel from the nave, but the cathedral&#x27;s trustees wished to avoid this. The old main altar was removed in February 1942 and the new main altar of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was consecrated that May. A new altar in the Lady chapel, donated by George J. Gillespie, was also consecrated in May 1942.

The George A. Fuller Company started renovating the exterior in August 1945 after blasting for a nearby building dislodged a stone from the facade. The main doorway was narrowed, and some of the projecting Gothic ornamentation was eliminated because they were prone to cracks in New York City&#x27;s climate, which was characterized by abrupt temperature decreases. A bronze cross was placed atop the north tower, replacing the original stone cross there. The project involved 350 workers at its peak. Some funds for the renovation came from a 1946 bequest of $100,000 from radio personality Major Bowes. By early 1947, the project was completed except for the Lady Chapel and a set of new entrance doors. An anonymous donor gave the cathedral a $25,000 window, which was designed by Charles J. Connick Associates and unveiled in April 1947. Work began on an interior renovation in mid-1948, with 17 of the cathedral&#x27;s 19 altars being replaced. Cardinal Francis Spellman blessed the new bronze doors in December 1949.

==== 1950s to 1990s ====

In 1952, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral received five gifts. These funded the electrification of the cathedral chimes; an elevator to the main organ; kneeling cushions and guard cords in the pews; and new stained-glass windows. The windows, depicting 12 male and 12 female saints, were installed at the clerestory in 1954. These windows were funded by a bequest by Atlas Portland Cement Company president John R. Morron, who left $200,000 for the archdiocese in his will. The cathedral celebrated the 100th anniversary of its cornerstone-laying in 1958. At the time, the cathedral had over three million visitors a year. St. Patrick&#x27;s celebrated the 50th anniversary of its consecration two years later.

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered designating St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral as a New York City landmark in early 1966. Later that year, the LPC designated the cathedral as a New York City Landmark. Under Cardinal Terence Cooke&#x27;s leadership, the interior of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was restored starting in 1972. That June, workers placed scaffolding on the cathedral to protect it from damage due to blasting for the construction of Olympic Tower across 51st Street. Afterward, over 100 workers cleaned and painted the interior while the cathedral remained open. The $800,000 project was completed in April 1973. The cathedral close, consisting of all structures on the same block as the cathedral, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral celebrated the centennial of its opening in May 1979. The cathedral&#x27;s popularity was attributed to its location in midtown, and about 6,000 people attended Mass on Sundays, ninety percent of whom were visitors. The cathedral&#x27;s exterior was cleaned the same year. Further restoration began in 1984 during the episcopate of Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor. As part of the work, most of the roof was replaced, and the entrance steps, doors, and walls were also repaired. The cathedral&#x27;s two organs were restored in the mid-1990s.

===21st century===
Under Cardinal Edward Egan, another renovation of the cathedral was planned in 2006 after chunks of rock started falling from the facade. The project was conducted between 2012 and 2015 at a cost of $177 million. The renovation was designed by Murphy Burnham &amp; Buttrick and led by construction manager Structure Tone. The renovation involved cleaning the exterior marble, repairing stained-glass windows, painting the ceiling, and replacing the flooring and steps. In addition, the bronze doors were renovated and reinstalled. Work was completed by September 17, 2015, before Pope Francis visited the cathedral the next week. The scaffolding was removed in July 2016. The cathedral and the renovations were featured on WNET&#x27;s television program &quot;Treasures of New York&quot;.

The LPC approved a garage on the 50th Street side of the cathedral in late 2015. The garage was designed to provide a secure entrance for Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. In 2017, MBB Architects and Structure Tone, Landmark Facilities Group, and P.W. Grosser completed a new geothermal system under St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, believed to be the largest in New York City. The gardens adjoining the cathedral to the north and south were excavated for the system&#x27;s construction, and they were replanted after installation was complete. The same October, a shrine to the Lebanese Maronite Saint Charbel Makhlouf was dedicated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The cathedral was temporarily closed for in-person Mass in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The pandemic severely reduced the cathedral&#x27;s finances as much of its income came from donations at Mass and the archdiocese did not fund the cathedral&#x27;s maintenance. It was reopened for full-capacity worship in May 2021.

Following the rezoning of East Midtown in the late 2010s, the Archdiocese of New York began planning to sell the air rights attached to the cathedral&#x27;s site. In December 2023, Citadel LLC and Vornado Realty Trust agreed to pay as much as $164 million for up to of the cathedral&#x27;s air rights, which would be transferred to a site at 350 Park Avenue.

== Main structure ==

St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was designed by James Renwick Jr. with influences from English, French, and German Gothic architecture. It is the largest Gothic Revival Catholic cathedral in North America, as well as the first major Gothic Revival cathedral in the United States. St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was described by CNN in 2020 as being an &quot;essential part of New York City&#x27;s architectural heritage&quot;. The cathedral serves as the seat for the Archdiocese of New York and as a parish church for the archdiocese within Manhattan. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, over five million people visited the cathedral each year.

The foundation stones are made of blue gneiss granite set within cement mortar. The lowest horizontal course of the facade, as well as the lowest course under all the interior columns. is made of Dix Island granite from Maine. The exterior is clad in marble quarried in Lee, Massachusetts, and Pleasantville, New York. The main section of the cathedral is made of Tuckahoe marble. Behind the marble blocks are walls made of brick and stone laid in rough masonry, with hollow gaps for ventilation. The blocks were so closely laid that, decades after the cathedral&#x27;s completion, no cracks had formed in them. The side walls are between thick, and the clerestory walls above the nave are 3 feet thick. Part of the interior is made of artificial Coignet stone. The marble for the spires was sourced from Cockeysville, Maryland, and the roof has 343 finials.

There are 103 windows on the cathedral in total. The windows are glazed by two thicknesses of sash and glass, set apart, to regulate interior temperatures and prevent air drafts. The exterior sashes are glazed with figured glass in lead sash, while the interior sashes are glazed with stained glass. The windows of the clerestory were made by Morgan Brothers. The cathedral had been constructed with 57 stained-glass windows: 37 representing scenes from Scripture and 20 representing geometrical shapes. Forty-five of the original windows were manufactured by Nicholas Lorin and Henry Ely in France. Other stained glass windows were added later. Renwick&#x27;s original sketches show that the tracery near each window was designed with two grooves: one for stained glass and one for protective glazing.

=== Location and dimensions ===
St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It takes up a full city block bounded by Fifth Avenue to the west, 51st Street to the north, Madison Avenue to the east, and 50th Street to the south. Clockwise from northwest, the cathedral is directly across from Olympic Tower, 11 East 51st Street, and 488 Madison Avenue to the north; the Villard Houses and Lotte New York Palace Hotel to the east; 18 East 50th Street and the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store to the south; and the International Building of Rockefeller Center to the west. St. Patrick&#x27;s is directly across from the &quot;Atlas&quot; statue at the International Building.

St. Patrick&#x27;s is oriented west–east relative to the street grid and has a cruciform plan. From west to east, the cathedral contains a nave; transepts extending to the north and south; and a sanctuary and apse. The entire structure measures long as measured along the exterior buttresses. The cathedral is wide at the transepts. The main facade is oriented west along Fifth Avenue, with two towers measuring wide and tall, flanking a central section wide. To the north and south are planted gardens, which contain ten manholes for the cathedral&#x27;s subterranean geothermal system. The cathedral&#x27;s total length is .

The cathedral&#x27;s interior was designed to accommodate 14,000 seated guests or 19,000 in total. It has a seating capacity for about 2,400 congregants. There are about 300 wooden pews ranging from wide. The underground geothermal system consists of ten wells, each deep, which could concurrently send hot and cold air to separate sections of the cathedral. The system is capable of producing of heat and of air conditioning hourly. The geothermal system uses a computer to send cool or warm air based on thermostat readings. Heat and cool air are pumped through four water loops.

==== Central gable and doors ====
The central portion of the Fifth Avenue facade contains a gable, which leads into the narthex. The main entrance is an archway at the base of the gable, measuring wide and tall. The actual entrance portal is recessed about into the archway and contains the main doors. The top of the portal is slightly pointed, with carved spandrel panels on either side. Above is a marble transom bar as well as elaborate floral tracery. The portal is flanked by decorative jambs, which in turn are topped by foliage capitals. Atop the jambs are a set of buttresses, which converge to form pointed arches. A rises over the main portal and contains tracery paneling and a shield bearing the arms of the Archdiocese of New York.

The main entrance originally contained a pair of square-headed marble doors. The current bronze doors were designed by Charles Maginnis and sculpted by John Angel, and they were installed in 1949. Each door is and weighs . The main doors are generally kept open to welcome visitors; to save energy, a second set of glass pocket doors is installed directly behind. The main doors are decorated with relief sculptures representing three men and three women, with inscriptions indicating their significance to the cathedral and with particular focus on missionary work and assistance for migrants:

* St. Joseph, &quot;patron of the Church&quot; (top left)
* St. Patrick, &quot;patron of this Church&quot; (top right)
* St. Isaac Jogues Martyr, &quot;first [Catholic] priest in New York&quot; (middle left)
* St. Frances X Cabrini, &quot;mother of the immigrant&quot; (middle right)
* St. Kateri Tekakwitha, &quot;lily of the Mohawks&quot; (bottom left)
* Mother Elizabeth Seton, &quot;daughter of New York&quot; (bottom right)
Above the central opening is a balustrade made of rich pierced tracery; it contains a row of niches, measuring high, for statues. These niches are decorated by columns with foliage capitals and gablets, with tracery and finials. The niches depict six archangels: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Chamuel, and Jophiel. Above these niches is a rose window, measuring in diameter and designed by Charles Connick. The rose window is blue with red, green, white, and gold panels. The window depicts eight types of leaves at its center, as well as trefoils with white doves. The main gable is carried up to the roof lines, terminating at a cornice with crockets that support a foliated cross. On either side of the jambs of the central window are buttresses, terminated by pinnacles, and between these and the buttresses of the tower are rich Gothic panels, terminated by crocketed gablets.

==== Towers ====
The towers on either side of the central gable measure at the base and retain this square cross-section to a height of . The walls of the towers along Fifth Avenue are thick. The ground story of the towers has portals similar in design to that at the center, but there are shields in the central panel of each gablet. The shield in the left tower has the arms of the United States and the shield in the right tower has the arms of New York. The second story, at the same height as the rose window, has molded jambs and tracery and is topped by gablets with tracery. The third story has four small windows on each side, topped by a cornice and pierced battlement. The towers are flanked by massive buttresses decorated with tabernacles, and the tops of the towers&#x27; square portions have clustered pinnacles. Above the square cross-sections are octagonal lanterns measuring tall. Circular stone stairways and a chime of bells were installed in the towers.

The towers are topped by spires measuring high. The spires are composed of two tiers with elaborate molding and tracery; the upper tier of each tower had a foliate finial above it. The spires were also planned with octagonal cross-sections, tapering from a base measuring across to a pinnacle measuring across. Also planned within the spires were floors, constructed at intervals of .

===Nave===
The nave is about long as measured from the Fifth Avenue facade. It measures wide if chapels are not included, or around wide if the chapels in the side aisles are included. The nave consists of a center aisle and two side aisles running west–east. The center aisle is wide and high while the side aisles are wide and high. Internally, the nave is divided into seven bays from west to east. The westernmost bay is part of the towers along Fifth Avenue and the easternmost bay is part of the transept. The westernmost bay is wide and the other bays are wide. Just inside the entrances within the westernmost bay are busts of Pope Francis, Pope Benedict XVI, Pope John Paul II, and Pope Paul VI, all of whom have previously visited the cathedral.

Thirty-two white marble columns divide the center and side aisles. The marble columns are in diameter and are set up in sections weighing each. Each column consists of multiple smaller columns: four at the corners, measuring in diameter, and eight surrounding the central shaft, measuring in diameter. The columns are tall to the bottom of the arches that support the nave&#x27;s ceiling. Above the center aisle is a series of groin vaults supported by molded ribs, with foliate bosses at the intersection of each vault. The ceiling has holes with diameters of ; ropes could be threaded through these holes to allow repairs and cleaning. The side aisles are similar to those at Saint-Ouen Abbey, Rouen, while the columns and ceiling are similar to British models such as Westminster Abbey.

The northern and southern facades are divided into five bays, with buttresses and pinnacles between each bay. The lower section of each bay contains an arched window measuring wide and wide. Mullions divide each of these windows vertically into three sections, and the top of each window has tracery. Above these windows is the triforium, which is above the nave floor. Four arches on either side of the nave support the triforium, which is tall. The clerestory level of the nave rises for above the triforium and contains six bays. Each clerestory window is wide and high. The top of the clerestory is above ground.

There are twelve chapels in the side aisles. Located under the side aisles&#x27; windowsills, the chapels each measure wide and high. The chapels have similar vaulted ceilings to the nave, and each has its their own altars. On the northern side-aisle is a dark-wood baptistery on a marble podium, The baptistery was designed by John La Farge. The chapels include one for St. Bernard and St. Bridget. Among the altars are those for Saint Elizabeth, designed by Roman artist Paolo Medici; a Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle altar, sculpted by Dominic Borgia; and the Saint Louis and the Saint Michael altars, designed by Tiffany &amp; Co.

=== Transepts ===
The transepts measure from north to south. The transepts contain entrances facing north on 51st Street and south on 50th Street. These entrances are similar in design to the central gable on Fifth Avenue. As planned, the transept doorways were to measure wide and high. The large transept window over the 50th Street door represents St. Patrick, while that over the 51st Street door represents the Immaculate Conception. The transept windows measure wide by tall and are divided by mullions into six vertical sections. Over each transept window rises a paneled gablet. A row of niches crosses each of the transepts&#x27; facades at the eave line. Above this, each facade has a gable with pinnacles and pierced battlements, which in turn is topped by an octagonal pinnacle and foliated cross.

On both sides of either entrance are tall windows. The windows are similar in design to those on the side aisles of the nave. The side windows depict the Four Evangelists. These windows are flanked by octagonal buttresses, which contain spiral stairs leading to the triforium and roofs. The roof at the intersection of the nave and transept contains a central finial high, which is gilded and is decorated with foliage and flowers.

Inside the transepts are the Stations of the Cross, which are carved in stone and were manufactured by the Stoltzenberg Company in Roermond, the Netherlands. There are five Stations of the Cross in total. Three of them received prizes from the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893 before they were installed at the cathedral. In 1908, bronze screens were installed at both transept entrances, measuring tall and wide. The bronze screens were designed so the transepts&#x27; wooden doors could open directly into them. Each screen had six wrought-bronze panels with ornamentation. The south transept contained the Altar of the Sacred Heart, which was made of bronze and had an elaborate tabernacle. The north transept contained the Holy Family altar, made of white Carrara marble and dedicated in 1893.

=== Sanctuary ===

The sanctuary floor is raised six steps above the floor of the nave, connected to it via a set of gray marble steps. The sanctuary is long and measures wide. The roof is made of slate, though the clerestory roof has a metal cresting high. There is a cross at the east end of the roof, which has flowers and foliage ornaments.

==== Ambulatory ====
The ambulatory, or side aisle of the sanctuary, is divided from west to east into three bays, similar to those in the nave. The apse has a convex polygonal wall with five bays, which are divided by buttresses with pinnacles. Each bay of the apse has a window wide and high. The windows are divided by mullions into four vertical sections; they are surmounted by paneled gablets with traceries. The walls between the gablets and pinnacles are finished by pierced battlements. The south ambulatory has a marble &quot;Pietà&quot; sculpture designed by William Ordway Partridge and completed in 1905. The south ambulatory also contains St. Joseph&#x27;s Altar, which is made of bronze and mosaic. The first four Cardinals&#x27; &quot;galeros&quot;, or brimmed red felt hats, are mounted at the back of the sanctuary; the Catholic Church stopped issuing galeros to its cardinals in 1969.

There are eleven windows on the sanctuary&#x27;s clerestory, of which six represent sacrifice (three each on the north and south sides). The three windows on the north side represent the sacrifices of Abel, Noe, and Melchisedech, while the three on the south side represent the sacrifices of Abraham, the Paschal Lamb, and the Mount of Calvary. The five windows on the convex portion of the apse represent subjects from the history of the Lord. The apsidal windows represent the resurrection of Lazarus, the communion of St. John, the resurrection of Jesus, the giving of the keys of heaven to St. Peter, and Jesus meeting the disciples going to Emmaus.

==== Chancel and high altar ====
The original chancel and high altar, donated by Cardinal McCloskey, were three steps above the sanctuary floor and contained a platform of richly colored marble. The altar was made in Rome and designed in the Italian Gothic style. The altar steps intersected a marble tabernacle inlaid with precious stones and mosaics. Three bas-reliefs on the sides and front of the altar were carved in white marble. The archbishop&#x27;s pulpit, on the north side of the altar, was made of wood. In 1885, a Gothic-style octagonal pulpit was installed at the south side of the high altar. Weighing and measuring tall, the pulpit was made mostly of Carrara marble, except for six supporting pillars, which were made of Vienna marble. A heavy marble balustrade with carved panels surrounded the main pulpit, which itself was accessed by six marble steps. The altar was compared to a wedding cake when it was first consecrated. In 1930, a marble altar rail was designed by Robert J. Reiley and installed in front of the altar. The rail had carvings of saints.

At the rear of the original high altar was a stylobate with a reredos, or altar screen, measuring long and high. The clergy of the Archdiocese of New York gifted the altar screen, which was carved from Poitiers stone in France. The reredos was divided vertically into five parts: a central portion measuring wide, flanked on either side by panels measuring and wide. The base of the reredos was made of white marble, inlaid with alabaster and decorated with a bas-relief on each side. The reredos was topped by three towers, one at the center and one on each extreme end. The center tower ascended above the sanctuary floor while the corner towers ascended above the sanctuary floor. The center spire had a statue of Christ, while the other spires had statues of St. Peter and St. Paul. Between the towers were placed six niches with angels, three on either side of the center spire.

In 1942, the original high altar was removed from St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and consecrated at Fordham University Church in the Bronx. It was replaced with the current high altar, which is made of gray-white Italian marble and topped by a bronze baldachin. Maginnis &amp; Walsh designed the high altar. It lacks a tabernacle and a reredos, similarly to other high altars in cathedrals. The altar table measures deep and about long. The baldachin is supported by four piers; it slopes upward to a pinnacle with a statue of Christ the King. The statue is flanked by smaller pinnacles with angelic figures. The pulpit is along the south (right) side of the right altar.

===Crypt===
Under the high altar is a crypt in which notable Catholic figures that served the Archdiocese of New York are entombed. It is accessed by a set of doors behind the high altar. Originally, the entrance to the crypt was hidden by a heavy stone slab that required six people to lift. A stone staircase descended to a vault behind a set of slate doors. Large bronze letters with the names of those buried in the crypt are inscribed in the crypt doors. The crypt is about long and high, with a width of between the rows of coffins on either side. The crypt is square in plan except for a ventilating pipe at the southeast corner. It has space to bury either 24 or 42 people.

The crypt&#x27;s interments include all nine past deceased Archbishops of New York:
* John Joseph Hughes (Archbishop, 1850–1864; interred 1883)
* John McCloskey (Archbishop, 1864–1885; interred 1885)
* Michael Augustine Corrigan (Archbishop, 1885–1902; interred 1902)
* John Murphy Farley (Archbishop, 1902–1918; interred 1918)
* Patrick Joseph Hayes (Archbishop, 1919–1938; interred 1938)
* Francis Joseph Spellman (Archbishop, 1939–1967; interred 1967)
* Terence James Cooke (Archbishop, 1968–1983; interred 1983)
* John Joseph O&#x27;Connor (Archbishop, 1984–2000; interred 2000)
* Edward Michael Egan (Archbishop, 2000–2009; interred 2015)


Other interments include:
* Michael J. Lavelle (Cathedral Rector, 1887–1939, and Vicar General; interred 1939)
* Joseph F. Flannelly (Cathedral Rector, 1939–1969, and Auxiliary Bishop, 1948–1969; interred 1973)
* John Maguire (Coadjutor Archbishop, 1965–1980; interred 1989)
* Pierre Toussaint (interred 1990) – at the time of his interment, the only Catholic layperson to be interred at the cathedral
Fulton J. Sheen, Auxiliary Bishop of New York from 1951 to 1965 and later Bishop of Rochester, was interred in the crypt in 1979. During the late 2010s, the Archdiocese of New York and his relatives were involved in a three-year court dispute to keep his remains at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. On June 27, 2019, Sheen&#x27;s remains were disinterred from St. Patrick&#x27;s and transferred to St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Peoria, Illinois, where he had been ordained.

=== Lady chapel ===
The Lady chapel, designed by Charles T. Mathews, is east of the apse, facing along Madison Avenue. It was designed in a 13th-century Gothic style. The rear wall of the apse was partly removed in the first decade of the 20th century to allow the construction of an ambulatory around the choir&#x27;s outer wall. The removed section of the apse&#x27;s wall became part of Our Lady of Lourdes Church at that time. The chapel was designed with a roof and belfry made of green bronze, as well as walls surrounded by statues. The walls of the chapel were designed to be plain at the bottom, becoming progressively more elaborately designed at the top. Several gargoyles were designed as decoration for the chapel&#x27;s exterior. The chapel contains fifteen stained-glass windows depicting the mysteries of the rosary, five each for glorious, joyful, and sorrowful scenes. The Lady chapel has nine tall windows, as well as two side chapels with three windows each.

The chapel is separated from the apse by a glass wall that rests on a glass beam. The glass wall is designed with a minimalist bronze frame. The interior of the Lady chapel was designed with carved stonework. The original altar, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, had a high carved reredos, a mosaic floor, and a blue color scheme. The altar was replaced in 1942. The new altar is reached by three brown-marble steps. It consists of a white-marble reredos, an altar table, with a multicolored inlaid marble frontal named &quot;Annunciation&quot; designed by Hildreth Meiere, and a statue of the Lady on top. Under the Lady chapel is a crypt for the Kelly family, which had paid for the chapel.

=== Rectory ===
The rectory (originally the Vicar General&#x27;s house) is at the southwest corner with 51st Street, on the northeastern section of the cathedral close. It carries the address 460 Madison Avenue. The Gothic-style building is three and a half stories high and is clad with Tuckahoe stone and white marble. As designed, it covers a lot measuring . The basement was originally designed as the kitchen, laundry, and servants&#x27; quarters. The first floor had a hall clad with marble tiles; the reception and dining rooms were on the left and two parlors were on the right of the hall. The second and third floors were designed as bedrooms. White oak and black walnut was used throughout the building. The rectory had ceilings of on the first and second floors, on the third floor, and on the fourth. It had 30 rooms in total.

The rectory was substantially unchanged from its early-1880s construction until 1940. A new window was installed on the southern facade at ground level; new plumbing, electric wiring, an elevator, and a telephone switchboard were installed; and the curtains were replaced. The two first-floor parlors were converted into four offices and a waiting room, and the upper stories were divided into smaller bedrooms and studies. The rectory retained some original design features such as its black-walnut fireplace mantels.

In 1920, the rectory also hosted the marriage of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Fitzgerald.

=== Archbishop&#x27;s residence ===
The archbishop&#x27;s residence is at the northwest corner with 50th Street, occupying the southeastern section of the cathedral close. It carries the address 452 Madison Avenue. The archbishop&#x27;s residence covers . The Gothic-style building is three and a half stories high and is also clad with white marble. A plaque commemorating Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1965 visit to the cathedral is mounted on the facade.

, Cardinal Dolan shares the archbishop&#x27;s house with three other priests. On the third floor is a chapel for John the Apostle. The right-side wall has a plaque measuring with a holy water font made of silver. The Assumption of Mary, flanked by cherubs, is depicted atop the holy water font. The font was given by Pope Paul VI to Cardinal Cooke in 1971.

==Staff==
, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan is the archbishop of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, having served in this position since 2009. Since November 2021, Enrique Salvo has served as the rector of the cathedral. In addition, Rev. Andrew King is the master of ceremonies, and Rev. Donald Haggerty, Rev. Arthur Golino, and Rev. Ed Dougherty are also on staff. Rev. Stephen Ries serves as Cardinal Dolan&#x27;s Priest Secretary.

The director of music is Jennifer Pascual. The associate directors of music, who also serve as organists, are Daniel Brondel and Michael Hey. In addition, Robert M. Evers is the Music Administrator and Programs Editor.

== Bells ==
There are nineteen bells at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The bells were created by the firm of Messrs. Paccard in France and installed in 1897. They hang in the northern tower of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral above ground. Since there are fewer than 23 bells, the minimum needed to be able to ring two octaves, they hang in a chime instead of a carillon. A 1983 &quot;New York Times&quot; article reported that the chime was rung every day at 8 a.m., noon, and 6 p.m. Additionally, on Sundays, the chime was rung every 15 minutes between 10 a.m. and noon and every 15 minutes between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.

Originally, the bells were powered by a compressed air mechanism in the basement. Pressing a key on the keyboard in the sacristy would activate an electric signal, which in turn would release the compressed air to ring each bell. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, St. Patrick&#x27;s bells were the first to be operated by compressed air. Until 1952, the bells could also be rung using tracker action; the bell-ringer would pull a rod between the lever and clapper of each bell.

Each of the bells was donated by a different person or organization. The name of the bell, its donor, and the figure of the crucifixion is carved on each respective bell.
==Organs==

St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral has two pipe organs with more than 9,000 pipes, 206 stops, 150 ranks, and 10 divisions between them. The two organs are the Gallery Organ, completed in 1930, and the Chancel Organ, completed in 1928; both were manufactured by George Kilgen &amp; Son. Since the mid-1990s, the two organs have been able to operate as a single unit. The two organs are controlled by twin 5-manual drawknob consoles and have 207 registers, 116 stops, and 142 ranks between them.

The Chancel Organ is in the north ambulatory of the sanctuary, adjoining the Chapel of St. Joseph. It originally had three manuals, which controlled four divisions. The Chancel Organ originally had 46 registers, 18 stops, and 18 ranks. There were 1,480 pipes, placed inside an oak case with Gothic-style carvings. The Gallery Organ is in the western part of the nave below the Fifth Avenue rose window, as well as in the triforium near the south transept. The Gallery Organ had a four-manual stopkey console with 157 registers and 114 ranks. There were 7,855 pipes; the shortest measured long and the longest, long, crossed the triforia.

=== Organ history ===
The first organ was built by George Jardine &amp; Son and installed in 1879. It was composed of four manuals, 51 stops, and 56 ranks. In 1880, J.H. &amp; C.S. Odell installed an organ in the chancel with 2 manuals, 20 stops and 23 ranks.

George Kilgen &amp; Son designed the two current organs after Pietro Yon was hired to the music staff in the late 1920s. The Chancel Organ was dedicated on January 30, 1928, while the Gallery Organ was dedicated on February 11, 1930. Tonal modifications were made in the 1940s and 1950s, and additional renovations occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1993, while John-Michael Caprio was music director, a major restoration of the organs commenced, and the old three-manual consoles were replaced with twin five-manual consoles. The Peragallo Pipe Organ Company removed the cathedral&#x27;s organ for cleaning in early 1994. The next year, the Chancel Organ was restored. The restoration was completed after the Echo Organ in the triforium was restored. All the organs of the cathedral were removed from the cathedral during the 2012–2015 restoration, and were restored, cleaned and re-voiced by the Peragallo Company before being reinstalled in 2015.

In 2024, the Casavant Frères organ company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, began the process of fully renovating and rebuilding the instrument to a position of technical reliability and durability, and with historic and artistic tonal refinements. On December 19, 2024, Cardinal Dolan announced the public launch of the fundraising campaign for the first complete renovation of the Kilgen organs.

===Directors of music===
In the first nine decades of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral&#x27;s history, it only had four music directors. The first organist and director of music at the current St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral was William F. Pecher, who had been hired at the Old Cathedral in 1862 and served at the current cathedral from 1879 to his death in 1904. Afterward, Jacques C. Ungerer served as the director of music until 1929. He was succeeded by Pietro Yon, who at the time was an assistant director. When Yon suffered a stroke in 1943, Dr. Charles Marie Courboin was temporarily appointed to Yon&#x27;s position. Yon died the same year and Courboin served as music director until 1970.

The cathedral&#x27;s fifth music director, John Grady, served as a music director and organist from 1970 to his death in 1990. Grady was succeeded by John-Michael Caprio, who also served until his death, in 1997. Four people served as directors over the following six years: John C. West (1997–1999), Robert Long (1999–2001), Don Stefano Concordia (2001), and Johannes Somary (2001–2003). Since 2003, Jennifer Pascual has served as the music director, being the first woman to hold this position.
==Incidents==

Over the years, St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral has been targeted by bombings and threats:
* On October 13, 1914, a bomb exploded on the northwest corner of the cathedral. It tore an 18-inch hole in the floor. One injury was reported: a boy whose head was grazed by a flying piece of metal.
* In March 1915, Italian anarchists Frank Abarno and Carmine Carbone of the Bresci Circle were arrested for attempting to detonate a bomb in the cathedral.
* In January 1951, a letter threatened that a bomb would be set off at a Sunday Mass, but the Mass continued without any disruption. Another, telephoned bomb threat occurred in June 1953.
* On April 18, 2019, just two days after a fire damaged the Notre-Dame de Paris, a 37-year-old New Jersey man carrying a pair of full two-gallon cans of gasoline, two bottles of lighter fluid, and two extended butane lighters was arrested after attempting to enter the cathedral. The man was a philosophy professor at nearby Seton Hall University who suffered from schizophrenia.

In addition, there have been numerous instances of vandalism:
* In 1944, red paint was splashed on the cathedral. The paint was smeared in a pattern similar to the hammer and sickle of a communist party.
* On May 30, 2020, during the nationwide protests and riots following the murder of George Floyd, Black Lives Matter protesters spray-painted pro-BLM and anti-police slogans on the facade. Two people were charged the following month for the crime.
* On New Year&#x27;s Day 2021, the cathedral was vandalized again with anti-police graffiti.

Other incidents have included:
* A 2020 report by the Vatican accepted earlier reports that the laicized Cardinal Theodore McCarrick committed acts of sex abuse at the cathedral between 1971 and 1972.
* On September 21, 1988, a mentally ill man killed an usher and seriously injured an officer before being fatally shot.
* On December 10, 1989, ACT UP, a pressure group that advocates for AIDS awareness, led a demonstration of 4,500 people outside the cathedral as part of their Stop the Church campaign. About 130 infiltrated the church and disrupted the Mass, forcing Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor to abandon his sermon.
* In 2002, &quot;shock jocks&quot; Opie and Anthony held a promotion that encouraged listeners of their radio show to have sex in risky places. Two listeners were caught in a vestibule of the church doing so; they were arrested, along with comedian Paul Mecurio.
* On February 15, 2024, a funeral service was held for LGBTQ activist Cecilia Gentili, during which eulogies were delivered, which were denounced as irreverent and the behavior by attendees was denounced as sacrilegious and scandalous by the New York Archdiocese. Cardinal Dolan ordered a Mass of Reparation to be offered in reparation for the incident.

<text>Edward Michael Egan (April 2, 1932 – March 5, 2015) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Bridgeport from 1988 to 2000 and as Archbishop of New York from 2000 to 2009. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 2001.

==Early life and education==
The third of four children, Edward Egan was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Thomas J. and Genevieve (née Costello) Egan. His father was a sales manager and his mother was a homemaker and former teacher; his parents&#x27; families were from County Mayo and County Clare, Ireland. In 1943, Egan and his older brother contracted polio, causing them to miss two years of school while convalescing at home.

Egan attended Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, where he was student body president and editor of the student newspaper and yearbook. After graduating from high school in 1951, he entered St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein, Illinois, where he obtained a Bachelor of Philosophy degree. Egan was then sent to the Pontifical North American College in Rome, taking his academic courses in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University.

==Priesthood==
Egan was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Martin O&#x27;Connor on December 15, 1957, for the Archdiocese of Chicago.

Egan was awarded a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Gregorian University in 1958. After returning to Chicago, he served as associate pastor of Holy Name Cathedral Parish, assistant chancellor for the archdiocese, and priest-secretary to Cardinal Albert Meyer. During this time, Egan also taught evening classes for potential Catholic converts and served as a chaplain at Wesley Memorial Hospital in Chicago.

In 1960, Egan returned to the Gregorian University in Rome to pursue his doctorate. During his studies, he became assistant vice-rector and repetitor of moral theology and canon law at the North American College. Egan received his doctorate in canon law &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1964. Back in Chicago, Egan was appointed priest-secretary to Cardinal John Cody. As his secretary, he &quot;saw Cardinal Cody take the heat for good causes&quot; such as the civil rights movement and desegregation.

Egan was later appointed secretary of the Archdiocesan Commissions on Ecumenism and Human Relations, sitting on several interfaith organizations and establishing dialogue with Jews and Protestants . From 1969 to 1971, he served as co-chancellor for the archdiocese. Egan returned to Rome in 1971 when Pope Paul VI named him an auditor of the Sacred Roman Rota.

While serving on the Roman Rota, Egan also served as a professor of canon law at the Gregorian University and of civil and criminal procedure at the &quot;Studio Rotale&quot;. Egan served as a commissioner of the Congregation for the Sacraments and Divine Worship and a consultor of the Congregation for the Clergy as well. In 1982, Egan was chosen to be one of the six canonists who reviewed the new Code of Canon Law with Pope John Paul II before its promulgation in 1983.

==Episcopal career==
On April 1, 1985, John Paul II appointed Egan as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York and titular bishop of Allegheny. He received his episcopal consecration at the Basilica of Saints John and Paul in Rome on May 22, 1985, by Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, with Archbishop John O&#x27;Connor and Bishop John Keating serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: &quot;In the Holiness of the Truth&quot; Ephesians 4:24. As an auxiliary bishop, Egan served as vicar for education.

===Bishop of Bridgeport===
On November 5, 1988, John Paul II appointed Egan as the third bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport. He was installed on December 14, 1988.

During his tenure, Egan oversaw the reorganization of Catholic schools. He also raised $45 million for diocesan schools through a fundraising campaign, &quot;Faith in the Future.&quot; The diocesan Catholic Charities under his tenure became the largest private social service agency in Fairfield County, Connecticut. To support the 12 Hispanic parishes in the diocese, he brought Spanish-speaking priests to Bridgeport from Colombia. Egan also established a home for retired priests and a school for children with special needs.

Within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Egan served as chair of the board of governors of the Pontifical North American College and of the Committee on Science and Human Values. He was also a member of the Committee on Canonical Affairs, the Committee on Education, the Committee on National Collections, and the Committee on Nominations, and served two terms on the USCCB administrative board.

===Archbishop of New York===
John Paul II appointed Egan as archbishop of the Archdiocese of New York on May 11, 2000, a week after Archbishop O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s death. Egan was installed on June 19, 2000, with soprano Renée Fleming performing at the ceremony.

On becoming archbishop, Egan prioritized the encouragement of vocations to the priesthood. Besides private initiatives, each year on the Feast of St. Joseph (March 19), he offered a mass for prospective high school and college men. Egan appointed two priests as vocation directors to aid him in promoting the priesthood, although they were unable to reverse the declining trend.

Egan was elevated to the cardinalate by John Paul II at the consistory of February 21, 2001, becoming the cardinal-priest of &quot;Ss. Ioannis et Pauli&quot; (Sts. John and Paul). As cardinal, one of Egan&#x27;s main concerns was the archdiocesan seminary in Yonkers, New York. In March 2001, he announced the restructuring of the seminary faculty. A Staten Island pastor, Peter Finn, was chosen as seminary rector. Egan also added Avery Dulles, Sara Butler, and John DiNoia to the faculty. The minor seminary, then located in Riverdale, Bronx, was moved to the campus of the major seminary.

Egan was a prominent influence in New York City after the September 11, 2001, attacks at the World Trade Center. According to an article in &quot;Catholic New York&quot;:In 2002, the Institución del Mérito Humanitario in Barcelona, Spain, awarded Egan the &quot;Gran Cruz al Mérito Humanitario&quot;. Also in 2002, John Paul II named Egan and five other cardinals to the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signature, the church&#x27;s highest court of Canon Law.

For retired priests, Egan established the John Cardinal O&#x27;Connor residence in 2003 at the previous site of the minor seminary in Riverdale. 

In June 2003, Egan was accused of concealing the names of priests who had been accused of child molestation, but found not guilty by the church. His spokesman argued that the innocent should be protected, while groups such as Voice of the Faithful criticized the process as being out of the public view.

Egan participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. 

In December 2006, Egan began hosting a weekly program on &quot;The Catholic Channel&quot; of Sirius Satellite Radio in which he discussed a variety of topics, including events in the archdiocese and issues in the church. The channel also broadcast his Sunday mass from the cathedral.

On January 19, 2007, Egan announced that ten under-utilized parishes in the archdiocese would be canonically suppressed and eleven merged with other parishes, &quot;based on the migration of Catholics in the inner-city to the outer boroughs&quot;. He also announced the establishment of five new parishes; three in Orange County, and one each in Staten Island and Dutchess County. Building projects were also approved for nine parishes. The closures caused some discontent.

On December 15, 2007, Egan celebrated his 50th anniversary as a priest. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches on January 26, 2008. Egan then hosted the papal visit to New York during April 2008, marking the 200th anniversary of the diocese. 

In January 2009, Egan publicly condemned controversial statements made by Richard Williamson, an excommunicated Catholic bishop, about the reality of the Holocaust.

==Resignation and final years==
On April 2, 2007, Egan offered his letter of resignation as archbishop of New York to Pope Benedict XVI, having reached the mandatory retirement age of 75. Cardinal Egan was the first archbishop of New York to retire; all previous archbishops had died in office. Egan&#x27;s resignation became official on February 23, 2009, when Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Timothy Dolan as his successor. Dolan took possession of the archdiocese on April 15, 2009.

Egan served as a member of the board of trustees at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and a founding member of the board of governors at Ave Maria School of Law in Naples, Florida. He reached age 80 on April 2, 2012, and from then on ceased to be cardinal-elector.

Egan was admitted to St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Manhattan on April 4, 2009, experiencing stomach pains. After testing, he was released on April 7, and was later given a pacemaker in a low-risk surgery. He was well enough to preside over major liturgical services for the April 9th to 12th Easter Triduum, days before the arrival of his successor.

==Death and legacy==

Egan died on March 5, 2015, at NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan of cardiac arrest. and his death was publicly announced by Cardinal Dolan. Many bishops released statements mourning Egan&#x27;s abrupt death. From March 9 to the morning of March 10th, Egan&#x27;s body lay in state at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. It was flanked by an honor guard of members of the New York City Police Department, Fire Department of New York, Knights of Columbus, Knights and Ladies of Malta and Knights and Ladies of the Holy Sepulchre.

On March 10, a Requiem Mass for Egan was celebrated by Cardinal Dolan at St. Patrick&#x27;s. After the mass, Egan&#x27;s body was interred in the crypt of the cathedral beneath the high altar. The mass was attended by bishops from around the United States, Cardinals William Levada, Justin Rigali, Sean O&#x27;Malley, Roger Mahony, Daniel Dinardo, and then cardinal, now disgraced and defrocked, Theodore McCarrick. The apostolic nuncio, Carlo Maria Viganò, read a letter from Pope Francis. The mass was attended by then New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and former mayors Michael Bloomberg, Rudy Giuliani and David Dinkins, along with then Governor Andrew Cuomo.

==Views and controversies==

===Abortion===
In an article published next to a photo of a fetus in the womb, Egan compared tolerating abortions to the reasoning used by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin to commit mass murders. Egan believed that Catholic politicians who support abortion rights for women should be forbidden communion on grounds of public scandal. In April 2008, after newspapers had published photographs of Giuliani receiving communion at a mass in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral offered by Pope Benedict XVI, Egan issued a public statement:
===Gay marriage===
Egan assailed the notion of same-sex marriage and criticized Hollywood for &quot;desecrating&quot; marriage and destroying &quot;something sacred and holy.&quot; Egan said the specter of legal same-sex marriage would have a devastating effect on traditional values already eroded by a crude pop culture, the &quot;New York&quot; &quot;Daily News&quot; reported.

===Alleged abuse in Bridgeport===

The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in May 2009 that records detailing allegations of sexual abuse by priests in the Diocese of Bridgeport should be released. The court&#x27;s 4-1 ruling covers more than 12,600 pages of documents from 23 lawsuits against six priests that have been under seal since the Diocese of Bridgeport settled the cases in 2001.

In April 2002, in a letter read out at mass, Egan apologized saying, &quot;If in hindsight we also discover that mistakes may have been made as regards prompt removal of priests and assistance to victims, I am deeply sorry.&quot; Ten years later, in February 2012, Egan retracted his apology. In an interview with &quot;Connecticut Magazine, &quot;he said: &quot;I never should have said that,&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t think we did anything wrong.&quot; He repeatedly denied that any sexual abuse happened while he was leading the Diocese of Bridgeport.

In August 2018, Reverend Boniface Ramsey said that he once tried to speak with Egan concerning the sexual activities of then-cardinal McCarrick, but that Egan &quot;didn&#x27;t want to hear it.&quot; McCarrick maintained his innocence but the Vatican found him guilty of sexual abuse crimes and laicized him.

In October 2019, former Connecticut Superior Court Judge Robert Holzberg released the results of his investigation, commissioned by Bishop Frank Caggiano, into the diocese&#x27;s handling of accusations of sexual abuse by its priests. Holzberg found that all three of Bridgeport&#x27;s bishops over forty years had consistently failed to fulfill their moral and legal responsibilities.

Holzberg found that Egan took a &quot;dismissive, uncaring, and at times threatening attitude toward survivors&quot;; he characterized Egan&#x27;s behavior as &quot;profoundly unsympathetic, inadequate, and inflammatory&quot;. Holzberg said that Egan broke a 1971 state law by not reporting abuse allegations and that he deliberately concealed the reasons for abusive priests&#x27; transfers. Among other findings, in a July 12, 1993, letter to diocesan counsel Renato Ottaviani, explaining his refusal to seek the involuntary laicization of serial abuser Reverend Raymond Pcolka, Egan wrote:

===Clerical celibacy===
In a radio interview given on March 10, 2009, at the end of his tenure as archbishop, Egan stated that clerical celibacy in the Latin Church could be open to discussion. He added, &quot;I think it has to be looked at, and I&#x27;m not so sure it wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to decide on the basis of geography and culture—not to make an across-the-board determination.&quot; He further noted that Eastern Catholic married men were allowed to be priests with &quot;no problem at all.&quot;

Egan later moderated his statement, saying, &quot;Celibacy is one of the Church&#x27;s greatest blessings. I will have to be more careful about trying to explain a somewhat complicated matter in 90 seconds.&quot;

<text>Francis Joseph Spellman (May 4, 1889 – December 2, 1967) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of New York from 1939 until his death in 1967. From 1932 to 1939, Spellman served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston. He was created a cardinal by Pope Pius XII in 1946.

==Early life and education==
Francis Spellman was born on May 4, 1889, in Whitman, Massachusetts, to William Spellman and Ellen (née Conway) Spellman. William Spellman was a grocer whose own parents had immigrated to the United States from Clonmel and Leighlinbridge, Ireland. Spellman had two younger brothers, Martin and John, and two younger sisters, Marian and Helene. 

Spellman attended Whitman High School, a public school, because there was no Catholic school in Whitman. He enjoyed photography and baseball; he played first base during his freshman year of high school until suffering a hand injury. Spellman later managed the baseball team. After his high school graduation, Spellman entered Fordham University in New York City in 1907. He graduated in 1911 and decided to study for the priesthood. 

Archbishop William O&#x27;Connell sent Spellman to study at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He suffered so badly from pneumonia that the college administrators wanted to send him home to recover. He refused to leave and eventually completed his theological studies. During his years in Rome, Spellman befriended future cardinals Gaetano Bisleti, Francesco Borgongini Duca, and Domenico Tardini.

==Priesthood==
Spellman was ordained a priest at the Sant&#x27;Apollinare Basilica in Rome by Patriarch Giuseppe Ceppetelli on May 14, 1916. Upon his return to the United States, the archdiocese assigned Spellman to pastoral positions at its parishes. O&#x27;Connell, who had earlier sent Spellman to Rome, described him as a &quot;little popinjay&quot;. He later said, &quot;Francis epitomizes what happens to a bookkeeper when you teach him how to read.&quot; Spellman served a series of relatively insignificant assignments.

After the United States entered World War I in 1917, Spellman tried to enlist to become a military chaplain in the US Army, but failed to meet the height requirement. Spellman also applied to be a chaplain in the US Navy, but his application was personally rejected twice by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

O&#x27;Connell eventually assigned Spellman to promote subscriptions for the archdiocesan newspaper, &quot;The Pilot&quot;. The archbishop named him as assistant chancellor in 1918 and archivist of the archdiocese in 1924. 

After Spellman translated two books by his friend Borgongini Duca into English, the Vatican appointed Spellman as first American attaché of the Vatican Secretariat of State in Rome in 1925. While serving in the Secretariat, he also worked with the Knights of Columbus in running children&#x27;s playgrounds in Rome. Pope Pius XI raised O&#x27;Connor to the rank of privy chamberlain on October 4, 1926.

During a trip to Germany in 1927, Spellman established a lifelong friendship with Archbishop Eugenio Pacelli, who was serving there as apostolic nuncio. Spellman translated Pius XI&#x27;s first broadcast over Vatican Radio into English in 1931. 

Later in 1931, with the fascist government of Benito Mussolini in power in Italy, Spellman secretly transported a papal encyclical, &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot;, that condemned fascism, out of Rome to Paris for publication. He also served as secretary to Cardinal Lorenzo Lauri at the 1932 International Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, and helped reform the Vatican&#x27;s press office, introducing mimeograph machines and issuing press releases.

==Episcopal career==
===Auxiliary Bishop of Boston===
On July 30, 1932, Spellman was appointed auxiliary bishop of Boston and titular bishop of Sila by Pope Pius XI. The pope had originally considered appointing Spellman as bishop of Dioceses of Portland in Maine and Manchester in New Hampshire. Spellman received his consecration on September 8, 1932, from Pacelli at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome. Archbishops Giuseppe Pizzardo and Francesco Borgongini Duca acted as co-consecrators. 

Spellman was the first American to be consecrated a bishop at St. Peter&#x27;s. Borgongini-Duca designed a coat of arms for Spellman that incorporated Christopher Columbus&#x27;s ship the &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. Pius XI gave him the motto &quot;Sequere Deum&quot; (&quot;Follow God&quot;).

After his return to the United States, Spellman took up residence at St. John&#x27;s Seminary in Boston. The archdiocese later assigned him as pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in Newton Centre; there he erased the church&#x27;s $43,000 debt through fundraising. When Spellman&#x27;s mother died in 1935, Massachusetts Governor James Curley, Lieutenant Governor Joseph Hurley, and many members of the clergy, with the exception of O&#x27;Connell, attended the funeral.

In the autumn of 1936, Pacelli came to the United States, ostensibly to visit several cities and be the guest of philanthropist Genevieve Brady. The real reason for the trip was to meet with President Roosevelt to discuss American diplomatic recognition of Vatican City. Spellman arranged and attended the meeting at the Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, New York.

Spellman became an early friend of Joseph Kennedy Sr, the US ambassador to the United Kingdom and the head of a rich Catholic family. Over the years, Spellman witnessed the marriages of several Kennedy children, including future Senator Robert F. Kennedy, Jean Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy, and future Senator Edward Kennedy.

On Pacelli&#x27;s trip to the United States, he, Kennedy, and Spellman attempted to stop the vitriolic radio broadcasts of Reverend Charles Coughlin. The Vatican and the apostolic legation in Washington wanted his broadcasts to end, but Coughlin&#x27;s superior, Bishop Michael Gallagher of Detroit, refused to curb him. In 1939, Coughlin was forced off the air by the National Association of Broadcasters.

===Archbishop of New York===

After Pius XI&#x27;s death, Pacelli was elected as Pope Pius XII. One of his first acts was to appoint Spellman as the sixth archbishop of New York on April 15, 1939. He was installed as archbishop on May 23, 1939. He was painted twice in 1940 and again in 1941 by the artist Adolfo Müller-Ury. Spellman inaugurated the first regularly scheduled Spanish-language masses in the archdiocese at St. Cecilia&#x27;s Parish in East Harlem.

In addition to his duties as diocesan bishop, Pius XII named Spellman as apostolic vicar for the U.S. Armed Forces on December 11, 1939. Over the years, Spellman celebrated many Christmases with American troops stationed in Japan, South Korea, and Europe.

During his tenure in New York, Spellman&#x27;s considerable national influence in religious and political matters earned his residence the nickname &quot;the Powerhouse.&quot; He hosted many prominent clergy, entertainers, and politicians, including the statesman Bernard Baruch, US Senator David I. Walsh, and US House of Representatives Majority Leader John William McCormack. In 1945, Spellman instituted the Al Smith Dinner in Manhattan, an annual white tie fundraiser for Catholic Charities that is attended by prominent national figures.

After his appointment as archbishop, Spellman also became a close confidant of President Roosevelt. During World War II, Roosevelt asked Spellman to visit Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in 1943, 16 countries in four months. As archbishop and a military vicar, he would have &quot;greater freedom than official diplomats&quot;. During the Allied campaign in Italy, Spellman acted as a liaison between Pius XII and Roosevelt in efforts to declare Rome an open city to save it from bombing and street fighting.

====Cardinal====

Pius XII created Spellman as Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in the consistory of February 18, 1946. According to the historian William V. Shannon, Spellman was &quot;deeply reactionary in his theology and secular politics.&quot;

In 1949, when gravediggers at Calvary Cemetery in Queens went on strike for a pay raise, Spellman accused them of being Communists and recruited seminarians of the Archdiocese from St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary as strikebreakers. He described the actions of the gravediggers, who belonged to the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union of America, as &quot;an unjustified and immoral strike against the innocent dead and their bereaved families, against their religion and human decency.&quot; The strike was supported by the activist Dorothy Day and the author Ernest Hemingway, who wrote a scathing letter about it to Spellman.

Spellman was instrumental in getting William Brennan appointed to the Supreme Court in 1956 but later regretted it. Justice William O. Douglas once said, &quot;I came to know several Americans who I felt had greatly dishonored our American ideal. One was Cardinal Spellman.&quot;

Spellman participated in the 1958 papal conclave that elected Pope John XXIII. He was allegedly dismissive of John XXIII, reportedly saying, &quot;He&#x27;s no Pope. He should be selling bananas.&quot; In 1959, Spellman served as papal delegate to the Eucharistic Congress in Guatemala; during his journey, he stopped in Nicaragua and, contrary to the Pope&#x27;s orders, publicly appeared with future dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.

According to the Catholic journalist Raymond Arroyo&#x27;s foreword to a 2008 edition of Fulton Sheen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Treasure in Clay: The Autobiography of Fulton J. Sheen&quot;, &quot;It is widely believed that Cardinal Spellman drove Sheen off the air.&quot; Besides being pressured to leave television, Sheen also &quot;found himself unwelcome in the churches of New York City. Spellman canceled Sheen&#x27;s annual Good Friday sermons at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and discouraged clergy from befriending the Bishop.&quot;

The historian Pat McNamara views Spellman&#x27;s outreach to the city&#x27;s growing Puerto Rican community as years ahead of its time. He sent priests overseas to study Spanish, and by 1960, a quarter of the archdiocese&#x27;s parishes had an outreach to Spanish-speaking Catholics. In his years as a cardinal, Spellman built 15 churches, 94 schools, 22 rectories, 60 convents, and 34 other institutions. He also visited Ecuador, where he founded three schools: Cardinal Spellman High School and Cardinal Spellman Girls&#x27; School, both in Quito, and Cardinal Spellman High School in Guayaquil.

====Second Vatican Council====
Spellman attended the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 and sat on its board of presidency. He believed that the Vatican was appointing predominantly liberal clergymen to the council&#x27;s commissions. He opposed the Council reform that introduced vernacular language into the mass, saying, &quot;The Latin language, which is truly the Catholic language, is unchangeable, is not vulgar, and has for many centuries been the guardian of the unity of the Western Church.&quot; A theological conservative, Spellman supported ecumenism on pragmatic grounds. 

In April 1963, Spellman brought the Reverend John Murray as a &quot;peritus&quot; (expert) to the Second Vatican Council. This was despite the well-known animosity of Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, the secretary of the Holy Office, toward Murray. The apostolic delegate to the U.S., Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi, attempted to silence Murray, but Spellman and Murray&#x27;s Jesuit superiors shielded him from most attempts at curial interference. Murray&#x27;s work helped shape the council&#x27;s declaration on religious freedom. According to McNamara, Spellman&#x27;s support of Murray contributed to his significant influence on the drafting of &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;, the Council&#x27;s Declaration on Religious Freedom.

After John XXIII&#x27;s death, Spellman participated in the conclave of 1963 that resulted in the election of Pope Paul VI. Spellman later agreed to President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s requests to send priests to the Dominican Republic to defuse anti-American sentiments after the American intervention of 1965. 

Spellman led his archdiocese through an extensive period of building Catholic infrastructure, particularly churches, schools, and hospitals. He consolidated all parish building programs into his own hands and thereby got better interest rates from bankers, and convinced Pius XII of the need to internationalize the Vatican&#x27;s Italy-centered investments after World War II; for his financial skill, he was sometimes called &quot;Cardinal Moneybags.&quot;

====Later life and death====
In 1966, Spellman offered his resignation to Paul VI after the latter instituted a policy requiring bishops to retire at age 75, but Paul asked him to remain in his post. 

Spellman died in New York City on December 2, 1967, at age 78. He was interred in the crypt under the main altar at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. His funeral mass was attended by President Johnson, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Robert F. Kennedy, New York Senator Jacob Javits, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, New York Mayor John Lindsay, US Ambassador to the United Nationas Arthur Goldberg, and Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos.

===Homosexuality and anti-homosexuality===
Curt Gentry, a 1991 biographer of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, said that Hoover&#x27;s files contained &quot;numerous allegations that Spellman was a very active homosexual.&quot;

In 2002, journalist Michelangelo Signorile called Spellman &quot;one of the most notorious, powerful and sexually voracious homosexuals in the American Catholic Church&#x27;s history.&quot; John Cooney had published a biography of Spellman, &quot;The American Pope&quot; (1984). Signorile reported that Cooney&#x27;s manuscript initially contained interviews with several people with personal knowledge of Spellman&#x27;s homosexuality, including the researcher C. A. Tripp. According to Signorile, the Catholic Church pressured Cooney&#x27;s publisher, Times Books, to reduce the four pages discussing Spellman&#x27;s sexuality to a single paragraph. The published book contained these two sentences: &quot;For years rumors abounded about Cardinal Spellman being a homosexual. As a result, many felt—and continue to feel—that Spellman the public moralist may well have been a contradiction of the man of the flesh.&quot;

Both Signorile and John Loughery cite a story suggesting that Spellman was sexually active. They also relate a story that Spellman had a personal relationship with a male member of the chorus in the 1943 Broadway revue &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot;.

== Viewpoints ==

=== Racism ===
Although he had once expressed his personal opposition to demonstrations during the American Civil Rights Movement, Spellman declined J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s requests to condemn Martin Luther King Jr. He funded the trip by a group of New York priests and religious sisters to the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. Spellman opposed racial discrimination in public housing but also the social activism of such priests as Daniel Berrigan and his brother, Philip Berrigan, as well as a young Melkite priest, David Kirk.

=== Communism ===
Spellman once said &quot;a true American can neither be a Communist nor a Communist condoner&quot; and &quot;the first loyalty of every American is vigilantly to weed out and counteract Communism and convert American Communists to Americanism&quot;. 

Spellman defended Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s 1953 investigations of Communist subversives in the federal government, saying in 1954 that McCarthy had &quot;told us about the Communists and about Communist methods&quot; and that he was &quot;not only against communism—but ... against the methods of the Communists&quot;. 

As early as 1954, Spellman was warning the Eisenhower Administration about the advance of communism in French Indochina. He had met the future South Vietnamese president, Ngô Đình Diệm, in 1950, and was favorably impressed by his strongly Catholic and anti-Communist views. After the French defeat by the Viet Minh at the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Spellman started urging the Eisenhower Administration to intervene in the conflict. 

When the United States entered into the Vietnam War in 1965, he became a staunch supporter of the intervention. 

A group of college students protested outside Spellman&#x27;s residence in December 1965 for suppressing antiwar priests. Spellman spent Christmas 1965 with troops in South Vietnam. While there, he quoted Commodore Stephen Decatur, declaring, &quot;My country, may it always be right, but right or wrong, my country.&quot; Spellman also called the Vietnam War a &quot;war for civilization&quot; and &quot;Christ&#x27;s war against the Vietcong and the people of North Vietnam.&quot; 

Some critics called the Vietnam War &quot;Spelly&#x27;s War&quot; and Spellman the &quot;Bob Hope of the clergy”. One priest accused him of blessing &quot;the guns which the pope is begging us to put down&quot;. In January 1967, antiwar protestors disrupted a mass at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Spellman&#x27;s support for the war and his opposition to church reform greatly undermined his clout within the church and country. The illustrator Edward Sorel designed a poster in 1967, &quot;Pass the Lord and Praise the Ammunition&quot;, showing Spellman carrying a rifle with a bayonet. The poster was never distributed because Spellman died right after its printing.

=== Politics ===
Spellman denounced the efforts of US Representative Graham Barden to provide federal funding only to public schools as &quot;a craven crusade of religious prejudice against Catholic children&quot; and called Barden himself an &quot;apostle of bigotry.&quot; 

Spellman engaged in a heated public dispute in 1949 with former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt when she expressed her opposition to federal funding to parochial schools in her column &quot;My Day&quot;. In response, Spellman accused her of anti-Catholicism and called her column a document &quot;of discrimination unworthy of an American mother&quot;. Spellman eventually met with Roosevelt at Hyde Park to settle the dispute.

When Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy ran for president in the 1960 presidential election, Spellman endorsed his Republican opponent, Vice President Richard Nixon, a non-Catholic. This was because Kennedy opposed federal aid for parochial schools and the appointment of a U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See. Kennedy aide David Powers recalled that in 1960, Kennedy asked him, &quot;Why is Spellman against me?&quot; Powers replied, &quot;Spellman is the most powerful Catholic in the country. When you become president, you will be.&quot; Spellman&#x27;s endorsement of Nixon ended his long relationship with the Kennedy family.

In the 1964 presidential election, Spellman supported President Lyndon B. Johnson, whose Higher Education Facilities Act and Economic Opportunity Act had greatly benefited the Catholic Church.

=== Films and plays ===

* Spellman called the 1941 film &quot;Two-Faced Woman,&quot; starring Greta Garbo, &quot;an occasion of sin ... dangerous to public morals&quot;. He condemned Garbo for her alleged lesbian and bisexual morality.
* Spellman&#x27;s condemnation of the 1947 film &quot;Forever Amber&quot; prompted the producer William Perlberg to refuse publicly to &quot;bowdlerize the film to placate the Roman Catholic Church.&quot;
* Spellman called the 1948 Italian film &quot;The Miracle&quot; a &quot;vile and harmful picture ... a despicable affront to every Christian&quot;. 
* Spellman called the 1956 film &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, starring Carroll Baker, &quot;revolting&quot; and &quot;morally repellent.&quot; 
* When &quot;The Deputy&quot;, a play about Pius XII&#x27;s actions during the Holocaust, opened on Broadway in 1964, Spellman condemned it as &quot;an outrageous desecration of the honor of a great and good man.&quot; The play&#x27;s producer, Herman Shumlin, called Spellman&#x27;s words a &quot;calculated threat to really drive a wedge between Christians and Jews.&quot;

== Awards ==

* Gold Medal Award from The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York&quot; – 1946
* Distinguished Service Medal from the American Legion – 1963
* Order of Ruben Dario, the Nicaraguan government&#x27;s highest award, on his visit to Central America in 1958 and Nicaraguan postage stamp issued in 1959.
* Sylvanus Thayer Award by the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York – 1967

==Legacy==
Author Russell Shaw writes that Spellman &quot;embodied the fusion of Americanism and Catholicism in the mid-20th century. Spellman&#x27;s enduring accomplishments were his personal acts of kindness toward individuals and the religious and charitable institutions he founded or strengthened.&quot;Henry Morton Robinson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cardinal&quot; (1950) was based partly on Spellman. The book was adapted into the 1963 film The Cardinal, with Tom Tryon as the eventual cardinal.

In July 1947, a Jesuit residential building opened on the campus of Fordham University named in his honor.

<text>Patrick Joseph Hayes (November 20, 1867 – September 4, 1938) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of New York from 1919 until his death. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1924.

==Early life and education==
Patrick Hayes was born in the Five Points section of Manhattan to Daniel Hayes and Mary Gleason. In his own words, Hayes &quot;was born very humble and, I may say, of poor people.&quot; Both of his parents were from County Kerry, Ireland, and moved to the United States in 1864. A younger brother, John, was born in 1870. Hayes&#x27; mother died in June 1872, and his father later remarried around 1876; a half-sister, Anastasia, was also born that year. At age 15, he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, who ran a grocery store where Hayes then worked.

After attending La Salle Academy, Hayes studied at Manhattan College, where he excelled at philosophy and the classics and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors in 1888. At Manhattan, he also befriended George Mundelein, who would later become Archbishop of Chicago. Hayes then attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Troy.

==Priesthood==
Hayes was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Michael Corrigan on September 8, 1892. He was then sent for further studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., earning a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1894.

Upon his return to New York City, Hayes was appointed Curate at St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church on the Lower East Side, where he served under its pastor, John Murphy Farley (whom he would later succeed as Archbishop of New York). Hayes, following Farley&#x27;s elevation to the episcopacy, served as his private secretary from 1895 to 1903, thereafter he was appointed chancellor of the Archdiocese and Rector of the Cathedral College. He was named Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on October 15, 1907.

==Early episcopal career==
===Auxiliary Bishop of New York===
On July 3, 1914, Hayes was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of &quot;Thagaste&quot; by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 28 from Cardinal Farley, with Bishops Henry Gabriels and Thomas Cusack serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Bishop for the Military Services===
Hayes was later named Vicar Apostolic of Military, USA, on November 24, 1917. Serving as head of the American military ordinariate during World War I, he recruited hundreds of priests as commissioned officers or chaplains. He was also one of the four episcopal members of the executive committee of the National Catholic War Council.

==Archbishop of New York==
Following the death of Cardinal Farley in September 1918, Hayes was appointed by Pope Benedict XV as the fifth Archbishop of New York on March 10, 1919. He was formally installed as Archbishop on the following March 19. He founded the archdiocesan Catholic Charities in 1920, and subsequently became known as &quot;the Cardinal of Charities.&quot; In a 1921 pastoral letter, Hayes strongly condemned abortion, contraception and divorce. He had the first convention of the American Birth Control League raided, and later called its members &quot;prophets of decadence&quot;. He welcomed the election of Éamon de Valera as President of the Irish Republic and contributed $1,000 to Sinn Féin.

===Cardinal===
Pope Pius XI created him Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Via in the consistory of March 24, 1924. It was speculated that the Pope delayed his elevation to the Sacred College of Cardinals because a group affiliated with New York&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral had stoned the Union Club for flying a British flag, but Pius nevertheless warmly greeted Hayes at the consistory as &quot;dear little brother&quot;.

The cardinal opposed Prohibition, backed legislation to limit indecency on the stage, and endorsed unemployment relief during the Great Depression. Commenting on the Depression in 1931, he stated, &quot;The American people are experiencing a return to religion following a period of carelessness and cynicism marked by the prosperity of the land...Now they are returning when they find they are in need of something greater than the material in facing adversity and stress.&quot;

After the Rev. Charles Coughlin praised the former Mayor Jimmy Walker in New York, Hayes, who had earlier denounced Walker for his perceived lack of morality, ruled that no ecclesiastical visitor might address a religious gathering without the cardinal&#x27;s permission.

On June 24, 1924, he offered the invocation at the opening of the 1924 Democratic National Convention. He used his Tammany Hall connections to line up Democratic support in Congress for legislation protecting Catholic schools in the Philippines in 1932. During the Spanish Civil War, Hayes was outspoken in his support for the fascist-nationalist forces of General Franco, &quot;claiming that &#x27;Loyalists are controlled by radicals and communists&#x27;.&quot;
Hayes had a summer house in the Catskill Mountains, near St. Joseph&#x27;s camp, maintained by the Amityville Dominican nuns; he once encountered a group of Klansmen there.

==Death and legacy==
In September 1938, Hayes died from a heart attack, caused by coronary thrombosis, in Monticello, New York, at age 70. 

Cardinal Hayes High School in The Bronx is named after him.

<doc id="245242" wikidata="Q547365" url="?curid=245242" title="John Murphy Farley">
<text>John Murphy Farley (April 20, 1842 – September 17, 1918) was an Irish-American cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of New York from 1902 until his death in 1918, and became a cardinal in 1911.

==Early life and education==
John Farley was born in Newtownhamilton, County Armagh, Ireland, to Catherine (née Murphy) and Philip Farrelly. At age twelve, he was orphaned and went to live with his mother&#x27;s family in the townland of Moyles. He received his early education under the direction of a private tutor named Hugh McGuire. He then attended St. Macartan&#x27;s College in Monaghan from 1859 to 1864.

Under the auspices of an uncle, Farley emigrated to the United States at the height of the Civil War in 1864. He immediately enrolled at St. John&#x27;s College in New York City, graduating in 1865. He then began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph&#x27;s Provincial Seminary in Troy. In 1866, he was sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He was present in Rome during the whole period of the First Vatican Council.

==Priesthood==
Farley was ordained a priest by Cardinal Costantino Patrizi Naro on June 11, 1870. His first assignment, following his return to New York, was as a curate at St. Peter&#x27;s Church (Staten Island), where he remained for two years. Following the appointment of Francis McNeirny to the Diocese of Albany, in 1872 Farley became secretary to Archbishop John McCloskey, whom he had earlier met while in Rome. It was about this time that he changed the spelling of his name from &quot;Farrelly&quot; to &quot;Farley&quot;. He accompanied McCloskey to the 1878 papal conclave, but they arrived after the election of Pope Leo XIII had already taken place. Farley wrote the article on Cardinal McCloskey for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

From 1884 to 1902, Farley served as pastor of St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church in Manhattan. During his tenure at St. Gabriel&#x27;s, he freed the parish from debt, oversaw the consecration of the church, and built a parish hall. He was named a papal chamberlain in 1884 with the title of &quot;monsignor&quot;, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1892. In addition to his pastoral duties at St. Gabriel&#x27;s, Farley served as vicar general for the Archdiocese of New York from 1891 to 1902. He also served as president of the Catholic school board, in which position he organized a Catholic school parade in 1892. He later organized a Catholic school exhibit in 1894. He became a protonotary apostolic in 1895.

==Episcopal career==
On November 18, 1895, Farley was appointed auxiliary bishop of New York and titular bishop of &quot;Zeugma in Syria&quot; by Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 from Archbishop Michael Corrigan, with Bishops Charles Edward McDonnell and Henry Gabriels serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Farley became Apostolic Administrator of the archdiocese upon the death of Archbishop Corrigan on May 5, 1902, and was himself named the fourth Archbishop of New York on September 15 of that year. He was honored as an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1905.

Pope Pius X created him Cardinal Priest of &quot;Santa Maria sopra Minerva&quot; in the consistory of November 27, 1911. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV. Following the outbreak of World War I, Farley stated,&quot;As Catholics in America, we owe unswerving allegiance to the Government of America, and it is our sacred duty to answer with alacrity every demand our country makes upon our loyalty and devotion... I would that peace could come by arbitration and diplomacy. It seems, however, that no permanent peace can be hoped for except through the defeat of German arms in the field or the repudiation of the Prussian autocracy by the German people themselves. Criticism of the government irritates me. I consider it little short of treason.&quot;His dedication to victory in the war angered the Sinn Féin element of the New York clergy, who believed the Cardinal was bowing to anti-Irish bigots.

He made progress in Catholic education in the archdiocese the keynote of his tenure as Archbishop, and established nearly fifty new parochial schools within his first eight years; he also founded the Cathedral Preparatory Seminary. He was known to take daily walks with one of his priests down Madison or Fifth Avenue, noting, &quot;A man never collects his thoughts so well as when he walks alone or with a congenial spirit.&quot;

Farley died in Mamaroneck, at age 76. He is buried in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

<text>Michael Augustine Corrigan (August 13, 1839May 5, 1902) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church who served as the third archbishop of New York from 1885 to 1902.

==Early life==
Michael Augustine Corrigan was born August 13, 1839, in Newark, New Jersey, the fifth of nine children of Thomas and Mary English Corrigan, both of whom had emigrated from Ireland. Thomas Corrigan owned a retail grocery and liquor business in Newark, and the family&#x27;s well-to-do status allowed Michael to pursue his educational interests. He attended St. Mary&#x27;s College in Wilmington, Delaware, from 1853 to 1855, Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland, from 1855 to 1857, spent a year in Europe, and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s in 1859. He became a member of the first class at the North American College in Rome, was ordained to the priesthood in September 1863 at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, and received a doctorate of divinity in 1864.

Corrigan returned to New Jersey in 1864, where he joined the faculty at Seton Hall College and the Immaculate Conception Seminary, both in South Orange, as professor of theology and history. He soon achieved a reputation within the hierarchy for sound scholarship, and he also provided pastoral care to Catholics in the Seton Hall vicinity. When Bernard J. McQuaid left Seton Hall in 1869 to assume his duties as bishop of the Diocese of Rochester, Corrigan succeeded him as college president and also became vicar general of the Diocese of Newark.

==Bishop of Newark==
Corrigan succeeded James Roosevelt Bayley as bishop of Newark, becoming the second ordinary of the diocese. He was consecrated bishop on May 4, 1873, at 34 years old—becoming the youngest Catholic bishop in US history. The diocese encompassed the entire state of New Jersey during Corrigan&#x27;s tenure. He administered diocesan affairs during a time of rapid population growth, Roman Catholic institutional development, immigration from Ireland and Germany, and considerable urbanization in the northern part of the state.

When boys sent to state institutions were not allowed to attend Mass, the Bishop offered to provide clergy, was refused. He then established The Catholic Protectory in Denville, where the boys were taught skills and trades.

==Archbishop of New York==
Corrigan was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop to John Cardinal McCloskey of New York on October 1, 1880, with the titular see of Petra, and succeeded to the archbishopric on October 10, 1885, serving as archbishop until his death.

Corrigan&#x27;s career in New York proved controversial on a number of levels. He aligned himself closely with his former mentor, Bernard J. McQuaid and has been considered one of the leaders of the &quot;conservative&quot; movement within the American Catholic hierarchy. He proved to be a strong supporter of national parishes and parochial schools, a vocal opponent of John Ireland, James Gibbons and other bishops who advocated &quot;Americanization&quot; within the Catholic Church. Within the American hierarchy, he was the closest supporter of Pope Leo XIII on &quot;Testem benevolentiae nostrae&quot;. He also proved unpopular with many bishops for his involvement in backstage intrigue at the Vatican.

Within the Archdiocese of New York his most serious controversy involved his conflict with Father Edward McGlynn. During the 1886 mayoral campaign in New York City, the outspoken McGlynn supported Henry George, the candidate of the United Labor Party who proved popular with labor organizers, radicals, socialists, and Irish nationalists. Corrigan himself had been very close to Tammany Hall and ordered McGlynn to refrain from politics. McGlynn refused, continued to clash with the bishop, and ultimately was removed as pastor of St. Stephen&#x27;s Church in New York. McGlynn was summoned to Rome but refused on the grounds of ill health and was excommunicated in 1887. The censure was eventually lifted in 1892. This highly public scandal took its toll on Corrigan and contributed to his poor relationships with an influential group of New York intellectual priests. His greatest accomplishment probably involved the building of a new seminary, St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary, Dunwoodie.

In 1897, Edgardo Mortara preached in St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral New York City, but the Archbishop of New York told the Holy See that he opposed Mortara&#x27;s efforts to evangelize the Jews on the grounds that such efforts might embarrass the Church in the view of the United States government.

Corrigan was rebuked by the Vatican in 1887 for neglecting the spiritual needs of the surge of Italian immigrants settling in New York and for treating them in a humiliating way. Italians were neither permitted to attend Mass at Irish churches nor construct their own churches, instead being permitted to hear Mass only in the basements of Irish churches. Corrigan justified this exclusion on the grounds that the Italians were &quot;not very clean&quot; and would drive down revenues unless segregated from the Irish.

He also had invited Mother Cabrini to New York, but had to withdraw his invitation. By then Mother Cabrini and her missionaries had already embarked on their sea voyage to New York.

Corrigan slipped and fell when inspecting the excavation of the seminary in 1902. He contracted pneumonia during his convalescence and died. He was interred in the crypt under the altar of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

<text>John McCloskey (March 10, 1810 – October 10, 1885) was an American Catholic prelate who served as the first American-born Archbishop of New York from 1864 until his death in 1885, having previously served as Bishop of Albany (1847–1864). In 1875, McCloskey became the first American cardinal. He served as the first president of St. John&#x27;s College, now Fordham University, beginning in 1841.

==Early life and education==
John McCloskey was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Patrick and Elizabeth (née Hassan) McCloskey, who had immigrated to the United States from County Londonderry, Ireland, shortly after their marriage in 1808. He was baptized by Rev. Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., on May 6, 1810, at St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Manhattan. At that time Brooklyn did not yet have a Catholic church, so the family would row across the East River to Manhattan to attend Mass. 

At age 5, he was enrolled at a boarding school for boys in Brooklyn run by retired English actress Charlotte Melmoth. Even in his advanced years, he attributed his distinct enunciation to his training there. He moved with his family to Manhattan in 1817, and then entered the Latin school run by Thomas Brady, father of attorney James T. Brady and Judge John R. Brady. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1820, the family moved to a farm in Bedford, Westchester County.
He became the ward of Cornelius Heeney, a wealthy merchant and friend of the family.

The 11-year-old McCloskey, after a brief visit with Rev. John Dubois, entered Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in September 1821.
When McCloskey attended Mount St. Mary&#x27;s John Hughes, future archbishop of New York, taught Latin. As a student at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s, he was described as having &quot;won the admiration and esteem of his teachers and the respect and love of his college-mates by the piety and modesty of his character, his gentleness, and sweet disposition, the enthusiasm with which he threw himself into his studies, and his prominent standing in class.&quot; In his graduating year, he delivered a speech on patriotism that doubled as a defense of Horace&#x27;s phrase, &quot;&quot;It is sweet and fitting to die for one&#x27;s country&quot;.&quot; Following his graduation in 1826, he returned to his mother&#x27;s farm in Bedford.

==Priesthood==
During the spring of 1827, McCloskey was attempting to drive a team of oxen drawing a heavy load of logs when the wagon overturned and he was buried under the logs for several hours. After being discovered and taken to the house, he was completely blind and unconscious for several days. During his convalescence, however, McCloskey decided upon a vocation to the priesthood and later returned to Mount St. Mary&#x27;s in September 1827 for his seminary training. Although he regained his eyesight, he tired easily and was generally in poor health throughout the rest of his life. In addition to his studies, he became a professor of Latin in 1829. He received the tonsure, minor orders, and subdiaconate all from Bishop Francis Kenrick.

On January 12, 1834, McCloskey was ordained a priest for the Diocese of New York by Bishop John Dubois, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral. He thus became the first native New Yorker to enter the diocesan priesthood. 
He then served as a parochial vicar at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and a chaplain at Bellevue Hospital until February 1834, when he became professor of philosophy and vice-president at the newly established St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Nyack. However, the seminary was destroyed by a fire in August of that same year.

McCloskey expressed his desire to minister to the victims of the cholera epidemic in New York City, but Bishop Dubois, at the suggestion of Heeney, instead sent him to Rome to strengthen his health and to further his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University and University of the Sapienza (1834–1837). While in Rome, he befriended the likes of Père Lacordaire and Cardinals Thomas Weld and Joseph Fesch. Abandoning his pursuit of the degree of Doctor of Divinity in Rome, and departing from there in February 1837, he visited Germany, Belgium, France and England before returning to New York that summer. From August 1837 to March 1844, McCloskey served as pastor of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Greenwich Village. His tenure at the parish was initially a rather contentious one, with the trustees refusing to pay him a salary or furnish his house; one of his younger parishioners was Eugene Casserly, later a U.S. Senator from California. He also showed concern for the needs of the homeless children living in Greenwich Village. In addition to his duties at St. Joseph&#x27;s, McCloskey was the first President of St. John&#x27;s College in Fordham from 1841 to 1842, where he also taught rhetoric and literature.

==Episcopal ministry==

===Coadjutor Bishop of New York===
In 1843, McCloskey returned full-time to St. Joseph&#x27;s. Later that year he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of New York and Titular Bishop of &quot;Axieri&quot; by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 10, 1844—his 34th birthday—from Bishop John Hughes, with Bishops Benedict Fenwick (who had baptized him as a child) and Richard Vincent Whelan serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. Whereas Bishop Hughes was active and aggressive, his coadjutor was more meek and gentle. McCloskey busied himself primarily with a visitation of the entire diocese, and was also instrumental in the conversion of Isaac Hecker, founder of the Paulist Fathers, and of James Roosevelt Bayley, later Archbishop of Baltimore.

===Bishop of Albany===

McCloskey was named the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Albany by Pope Pius IX on May 21, 1847. He was formally installed by Bishop Hughes on the following September 19. At the time of his arrival, the Upstate New York diocese covered , containing 60,000 Catholics, 25 churches, 34 priests, 2 orphanages, and 2 free schools. McCloskey’s flock was made up largely of poor, uneducated Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine.

McCloskey first selected St. Mary&#x27;s Church as his episcopal see but it soon proved unsuitable, leading him to construct the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, whose cornerstone was laid in July 1848 and dedication took place in November 1852.

He attended the First Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1852, convened the first diocesan synod in October 1855, and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1862. During his tenure, he increased the number of parishes to 113 and the number of priests to 84, and established three academies for boys and one for girls, four orphanages, fifteen parochial schools, and St. Joseph&#x27;s Provincial Seminary in Troy. He also introduced the Jesuits, Franciscans, Capuchins, Religious of the Sacred Heart, Sisters of Charity, Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Joseph, and the De La Salle Christian Brothers into the diocese.

===Archbishop of New York===
Following the death of Archbishop Hughes in January 1864, McCloskey was widely expected to be named his successor. Distressed by the rumors, he wrote to Cardinal Karl von Reisach of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, objecting, &quot;I possess neither the learning, nor prudence, nor energy, nor firmness, nor bodily health or strength.&quot; Nevertheless, he was appointed the second Archbishop of New York on May 6, 1864. McCloskey, following the end of the Civil War in 1865, resumed the construction of the new cathedral begun under his predecessor; he later dedicated it in May 1879. In 1866 he attended the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, where he preached the opening sermon with remarkable self-control and composure given the fact he had learned only moments before that St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral had been gutted by a fire. However, the Trustees of the Cathedral immediately affirmed their intention to rebuild the Cathedral, and under the supervision of the Archbishop, the Cathedral was rebuilt sufficiently enough to celebrate Mass by Easter Sunday, April 21, 1867, just six months after the conflagration. The Cathedral rebuilding project was completed in full by March 13, 1868, and rededicated four days later on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day by Archbishop McCloskey, and assisted by the pastor of the Cathedral, Father William Starrs. McCloskey participated in the First Vatican Council from 1869 to 1870, and voted in favor of papal infallibility despite his feelings that such a declaration was &quot;untimely.&quot; On December 8, 1873, he solemnly dedicated the Archdiocese of New York to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
McCloskey was created Cardinal-Priest of &quot;S. Maria sopra Minerva&quot; by Pius IX in the consistory of March 15, 1875, thus becoming the first American cardinal. The news of his elevation was well received by Catholics and non-Catholics alike, and was viewed as a sign of the growing prestige of the United States. He received the red biretta from Archbishop Bayley in a ceremony at the rebuilt St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Mott Street on the following April 27. The Cardinal declared, &quot;Not to my poor merits but to those of the young and already vigorous and most flourishing Catholic Church of America has this honor been given by the Supreme Pontiff. Nor am I unaware that, when the Holy Father determined to confer me this honor he had regard to the dignity of the See of New York, to the merits and devotion of the venerable clergy and numerous laity, and that he had in mind even the eminent rank of this great city and the glorious American nation.&quot; Following the death of Pius IX in February 1878, McCloskey left for Rome but arrived too late to participate in the papal conclave, which elected Pope Leo XIII. The new Pope bestowed the red hat upon him on March 28, 1878.

When Thomas Ewing Sherman, son of the famed Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, expressed his desire to become a Jesuit to his father, the elder Sherman wrote a letter to McCloskey in 1879 telling him to dissuade his son from such a course of action. However, the Cardinal encouraged the boy in his vocation after visiting with him. In response, the General condemned McCloskey in a St. Louis, Missouri newspaper in offensive terms and accused him of robbing him of a son. When pressed for comment by the newspaper&#x27;s editor, McCloskey simply replied: &quot;General Sherman&#x27;s letter was marked &#x27;personal and confidential.&#x27;&quot; In 1880, he received Michael Corrigan, Bishop of Newark, as his coadjutor. His last major public appearance was in January 1884 for the Golden Jubilee celebration of his priestly ordination, for which Leo XIII sent him a jeweled chalice. In March 1884, with the help of President Chester A. Arthur and Secretary of State Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, the Cardinal helped save the Pontifical North American College from spoliation by the Italian government.

McCloskey&#x27;s 21-year-long tenure as Archbishop of New York was a productive one. In response to the growing Catholic population in New York, he established 88 additional parishes (for a total of 229) in the Archdiocese, 25 of them in Manhattan, four in the Bronx, and one in Staten Island; the remaining were established outside the city. Among these were the first parish for black Catholics as well as new churches for the growing Polish and Italian communities. The number of priests also rose from 150 to 400 during his tenure. An advocate of Catholic education, at the time of his death there were 37,000 children enrolled at archdiocesan schools. He established several charitable societies for children and a hospital for the mentally ill.

==Death==
Throughout 1885, Cardinal McCloskey suffered from bouts of fever, intense pain, loss of sight, and a recurrence of malaria that aggravated what appeared to be signs of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Within a few months, he was hospitalized and later died at 75. Present were his private secretary, Msgr. John Farley as well as his three beloved nieces. His funeral Mass was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on October 25, 1885; during the eulogy, Archbishop James Gibbons described him as &quot;a kind father, a devoted friend, a watchful shepherd, a fearless leader and, above all, an impartial judge.&quot; John McCloskey is interred under the main altar at St. Patrick’s on Fifth Avenue.

<text>John Joseph Hughes (June 24, 1797 – January 3, 1864) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as Bishop (and later Archbishop) of New York from 1842 until his death. In 1841, he founded St. John&#x27;s College, which would later become Fordham University.

A native of Ireland, Hughes was born and raised in Augher in the south of County Tyrone. He emigrated to the United States in 1817, and became a priest in 1826 and a bishop in 1838. A figure of national prominence, he exercised great moral and social influence, and presided over a period of explosive growth for Catholicism in New York. He was regarded as &quot;the best known, if not exactly the best loved, Catholic bishop in the country.&quot; He became known as &quot;Dagger John,&quot; both for his following the Catholic practice wherein a bishop precedes his signature with a cross, as well as for his aggressive personality. His sister Angela Hughes was a nun and oversaw the opening of 15 schools and convents in New York.

==Early life==
Hughes was born in the hamlet of Annaloghan, near Augher, in County Tyrone, part of the Province of Ulster in the north of Ireland. He was the third of seven children of Patrick and Margaret ( McKenna) Hughes who were from Errigal Truagh, County Monaghan. In reference to the anti-Catholic penal laws of Ireland, he later observed that, prior to his baptism, he had lived the first five days of his life on terms of &quot;social and civil equality with the most favored subjects of the British Empire.&quot; He and his family suffered religious persecution in their native land; his late sister was denied a Catholic burial conducted by a priest, and Hughes himself was nearly attacked by a group of Orangemen when he was about 15. He was sent with his elder brothers to a day school in the nearby village of Augher, and afterwards attended a grammar school in Aughnacloy.

Patrick Hughes, a poor but respectable tenant farmer, was forced to withdraw John from school and sent him to work one of his farms. However, being disinclined to farm life, he was placed as an apprentice to Roger Toland, the gardener at Favour Royal Manor, to study horticulture. His family emigrated to the United States in 1816 and settled in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Hughes joined them there the following year. He made several unsuccessful applications to Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College in Emmitsburg, Maryland, where he was eventually hired by its Rector, the Abbé John Dubois, S.S., as a gardener. During this time he befriended Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton, who was favorably impressed by Hughes and persuaded Dubois to reconsider his admission. Hughes was subsequently admitted as a regular student of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s in September 1820. In addition to his studies, he continued to supervise the garden, and served as a tutor in Latin and mathematics as well as prefect over the other students.

At that time, the president of Mount St. Mary&#x27;s was the brilliant Simon Bruté, who also lectured on Sacred Scripture and taught Theology and Moral Philosophy. (Bruté would later become the first bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana.) Hughes would on numerous occasions consult with his former teacher for advice long after he had left Emmitsburg.

==Priesthood==
As a seminarian, Hughes resolved to serve his home Diocese of Philadelphia, then governed by Bishop Henry Conwell. The bishop, while performing a canonical visitation of his diocese, met Hughes at his parents&#x27; home in Chambersburg and invited him to accompany him on the remainder of his visitation. On October 15, 1826, Hughes was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Conwell at Old St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia.

Hughes&#x27; first assignment was as a curate at St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia, where he assisted its pastor, the Rev. Father Michael Hurley, O.E.S.A., by celebrating Mass, hearing confessions, preaching sermons, and other duties in the parish. Later that year he was sent to serve as a missionary in Bedford, where he secured the conversions of several Protestants. In January 1827, he was recalled to Philadelphia and named pastor of St. Joseph&#x27;s Church. He labored afterwards at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, whose trustees were in open revolt against the bishop, and were subdued by Hughes only when he built St. John the Evangelist Church in 1832, then considered one of the finest in the country. Previous to this, in 1829, he founded St. John&#x27;s Orphan Asylum.

About this time Hughes became engaged in a public controversy over Catholic beliefs with the Rev. John A. Breckinridge, a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman and son of the former Attorney General in the Jefferson Administration. Several debates ensued between the two concerning whether Catholicism was compatible with American republicanism and liberty. Though it was predicted that the Irish immigrant would be outclassed by his better educated Protestant adversary, Hughes acquitted himself very well against his opponent&#x27;s attacks on his religion. The debates resulted in the pugnacious Hughes&#x27; emergence as a vigorous defender of Catholicism in America. His name was mentioned for the vacant see of Cincinnati and as a coadjutor for Philadelphia.

==Episcopacy==
===Coadjutor bishop===
Hughes was chosen by Pope Gregory XVI as the coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of New York on August 7, 1837. He was consecrated bishop at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral on January 7, 1838, with the title of the titular see of Basilinopolis, by the Bishop of New York, John Dubois, S.S., his former Rector. Although wishing Hughes no ill, many of the priests in the diocese had favored the popular Rev John Power, Vicar-General. Power had been overlooked for the position in 1826 when Dubois won the appointment as bishop. The clergy demonstrated their disappointment by not attending the consecration.

===Trusteeism===
One challenge Hughes took on upon arriving in New York was the dispute between the trustees of various parishes in the city, who held the control of these institutions. This practice was known as trusteeism, and the bishop challenged both the practicality and the legitimacy of it. Hughes drew upon his experience with this situation in Philadelphia and was able to get a referendum passed by the Catholics of the city in 1841 supporting the authority of the bishop.

===Education===
In 1840-1842 Hughes led a political battle to secure funding for the Catholic schools. He rallied support from both the Tammany Hall Democrats, and from the opposition Whig Party, whose leaders, especially Governor William H. Seward, supported Hughes. He argued Catholics paid double for schools—they paid taxes to subsidize private schools they could not use and also paid for the parochial schools they did use. Catholics could not use Public School Society schools because they forced students to listen to readings from the Protestant King James Bible which they believed undermined their Catholic faith. With the Maclay Act in 1842, the New York State legislature established the New York City Board of Education. It gave the city an elective Board of Education empowered to build and supervise schools and distribute the education fund. It provided that no money should go to the schools that taught religion, so Hughes lost his battle. He turned inward: he founded an independent Catholic school system in the city. His new system included the first Catholic college in the Northeast, St. John&#x27;s College, now Fordham University. By 1870 19 percent of the city&#x27;s children were attending Catholic schools.

===Bishop of New York===
Hughes was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the diocese the following year, due to Dubois&#x27; failing health. As coadjutor, he automatically succeeded Dubois upon the bishop&#x27;s death on December 20, 1842. He took over a diocese which covered the entire State of New York and northern New Jersey, having only some 40 priests to serve a Catholic population estimated to be about 200,000 at the time.

In 1844 anti-Catholic riots instigated by Nativist agitators threatened to spread to New York from Philadelphia, where two churches had been burned and twelve people had died. Hughes put armed guards at Catholic churches and, after learning a Nativist rally was scheduled to take place in New York, famously told the Nativist sympathizing mayor that &quot;if a single Catholic Church were burned in New York, the city would become a second Moscow&quot; – a reference to the Fire of Moscow. City leaders took him at his word, and the anti-Catholic faction was not allowed to conduct its rally.

Hughes founded the Ultramontane newspaper the &quot;New York Freeman&quot; to express his ideas. In 1850 he delivered an address entitled &quot;The Decline of Protestantism and Its Causes,&quot; in which he announced as the ambition of Catholicism &quot;to convert all Pagan nations, and all Protestant nations. ... Our mission [is] to convert the world –including the inhabitants of the United States – the people of the cities, and the people of the country, ... the Legislatures, the Senate, the Cabinet, the President, and all!&quot;

Hughes held a &quot;strong commitment to the cause of Irish freedom&quot; but also felt that immigrants, particularly his fellow Irish immigrants, &quot;should demonstrate their unswerving loyalty to their adopted land.&quot;

===Archbishop===
Hughes became an archbishop on July 19, 1850, when the diocese was elevated to the status of archdiocese by Pope Pius IX. As archbishop, Hughes became the metropolitan for the Catholic bishops serving all the dioceses established in the entire Northeastern United States. He convened the first meeting of the Ecclesiastical Province of New York in September 1854. After this he traveled to Rome, where he was present at the proclamation of the Immaculate Conception as a dogma of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius. Hughes served as President Lincoln&#x27;s semiofficial envoy to the Vatican and to France in later 1861 and early 1862. Lincoln also sought Hughes&#x27; advice on the appointment of hospital chaplains. On 3 September 1855, Archbishop Hughes traveled to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland for the consecration of the new Roman Catholic Cathedral.

In an address in March 1852, Hughes lionized what he referred to as the &quot;spirit of the constitution,&quot; expressed hope that the &quot;parties&quot; of the republic would be completely &quot;penetrated&quot; by that spirit, and stated that the founders&#x27; achievements in the realm of religious freedom were &quot;original&quot; in history and that the constitution&#x27;s &quot;negation of all power to legislate&quot; on &quot;rights of conscience&quot; made American law on that topic superior to that of other countries which had secured these rights &quot;by some positive statute.&quot; In the same address, Hughes also expressed sentiments of religious toleration, stating that &quot;we are indebted&quot; to the &quot;liberality of Protestantism,&quot; in light of the fact that the framers of the Constitution &quot;were almost, if not altogether, exclusively Protestants.&quot; He averred that the strong leadership of Washington and the variety of opposing Protestant views were likely more influential to the framers&#x27; stance on religious freedom than was Protestantism itself.

Hughes also stated that &quot;the great men who framed the Constitution saw, with keen and delicate perception, that the right to tolerate implied the equal right to refuse toleration, and on behalf of the United States, as a civil government, they denied all right to legislate in the premises, one way or the other.&quot; He affirmed the role of Catholic soldiers in American wars and declared, &quot;I think I shall be safe in saying that there has not been one important campaign or engagement in which Catholics have not bivouacked, fought, and fallen by the side of Protestants, in maintaining the rights and honor of their common country.&quot; Hughes also said that &quot;It is... out of place, and altogether untrue, to assert or assume that this is a Protestant country or a Catholic country. It is neither. It is a land of religious freedom and equality; and I hope that, in this respect, it shall remain just what it now is to the latest posterity&quot; and also that &quot;Catholics, as such, are by no means strangers and foreigners in this land... The Catholics have been here from the earliest dawn of the morning.&quot;

===Slavery and John Mitchel===
While Hughes did not endorse slavery, he suggested that the conditions of the &quot;starving laborers&quot; in the Northern states were often worse than that of those held in bondage in the South. He believed the Abolitionist movement veered towards ideological excess. In 1842 Hughes had cautioned his flock against signing O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s abolitionist petition (&quot;An Address of the People of Ireland to their Countrymen and Countrywomen in America&quot;) which he regarded as unnecessarily provocative.

Against what he saw as the Protestant republican agenda promoted by the Young Irelander exile John Mitchel and his journal the &quot;Citizen&quot;, Hughes, nonetheless, took a stand on the issue. Mitchel was uncompromising in defense of slavery by denying it was a crime &quot;or even a peccadillo to hold slaves, to buy slaves, to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction.&quot; He himself might wish for &quot;a good plantation well-stocked with healthy negroes in Alabama.&quot; At Mitchel saw it, Hughes copied the abolition press &quot;to cast an Alabama plantation&quot; in his &quot;teeth.&quot;

==Death==

Hughes served as archbishop until his death. He was originally buried in the old St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, but his remains were exhumed in 1882 and reinterred in the crypt under the altar of the new St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral which he had undertaken to build.

==Character==
Monsignor Thomas Shelley in his study on Hughes described him as a very &quot;complex character,&quot; with one side that was &quot;impetuous and authoritarian, a poor administrator and worse financial manager, indifferent to the non-Irish members of his flock, and prone to invent reality when it suited the purposes of his rhetoric.&quot; But Shelley finds this did not detract from the effectiveness of Hughes, who established 61 new parishes along with many other institutions.

Historian Daniel Walker Howe writes that Hughes &quot;labored to bring a largely working-class Irish community into a meaningful relationship with Catholic Christianity&quot; while at the same time working &quot;to conciliate middle-class Catholics and Protestant well-wishers whose financial support he needed for his amazingly ambitious program of building.&quot; Howe continues, &quot;Although no theologian, John Hughes ranks high for political judgment and in the significance of his accomplishments among nineteenth century American statesmen, civil as well as ecclesiastical. He successfully coped with fierce party competition in New York, bitter battles over the public school system, revolutions in Europe, the rise of nativism across the United States, and soaring rates of immigration after the Great Famine of Ireland. He encouraged his people to hard work, personal discipline, and upward social mobility.&quot; &quot;Crucially, he combined his staunch American patriotism with staunch devotion to a nineteenth-century papacy deeply suspicious of all liberalism, especially American.&quot; Hughes &quot;succeeded in fostering a strong Irish American identity, one centered on the Catholic faith rather than on the secular radicalism of the Irish nationalists who competed with him for community leadership.&quot; This achievement, however, came &quot;at the cost of losing to the Irish-American community the Irish Protestant immigrants.&quot;

According to his later successor, Patrick Cardinal Hayes, named archbishop of New York in 1919, Archbishop Hughes was severe of manner, and kindly of heart, but was not aggressive until assailed.

==Legacy==
In New York, Hughes founded St. John&#x27;s College (now Fordham University) and, under his administration, invited many religious congregations to staff and administrate schools in New York, among them members of the Society of Jesus (to whom he entrusted the care of St. John&#x27;s), who also established Fordham Preparatory School and Xavier High School; the Brothers of the Christian Schools who founded Manhattan College; and he established as an autonomous congregation the Sisters of Charity of New York, in which his sister Angela was a member, who founded the Academy of Mount St. Vincent (now College of Mount Saint Vincent). All of these institutions remain active to this day.

&quot;Hughes Hall,&quot; the first purpose-built home of Fordham Prep, was named for the archbishop in 1935. The building currently houses Fordham University&#x27;s Gabelli School of Business on its Rose Hill campus. There is also a dining space on the Rose Hill campus named &quot;Dagger John&#x27;s&quot; in honor of Hughes. A street near Fordham University is named in his honor (Hughes Avenue). In addition, each year, Fordham recognizes a graduating senior who has demonstrated achievement in the study of philosophy with an award named in honor of Hughes.

To the dismay of many in New York&#x27;s Protestant upper class, Hughes foresaw the uptown expansion of the city and began construction of the current St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral on Fifth Avenue between 50th and 51st Street, laying its cornerstone on August 15, 1858. It was not completed until after his death. At the time, due to its remote location in a still-rural part of Manhattan, the new cathedral was initially dubbed &quot;Hughes&#x27; Folly&quot; by the press for many years. Ultimately, Hughes&#x27;s foresight proved providential, as the rapid urban growth uptown would soon place the new cathedral in the emerging urban center of midtown Manhattan.

<doc id="245248" wikidata="Q438535" url="?curid=245248" title="R. Luke Concanen">
<text>Richard Luke Concanen, O.P. (December 27, 1747 – June 19, 1810) was an Irish-born Catholic prelate who served as the first Bishop of New York from 1808 to 1810. He was a member of the Dominicans.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Richard Concanen was born on December 27, 1747, in Connaught in the Kingdom of Ireland to a wealthy family. He received an early education in Ireland, but Catholic schools were outlawed there. He was forced to travel to Italy at age 17 to continue his education.

Deciding to become a priest in the Dominican Order, Concanen probably entered the Irish Dominican College in Louvain, Belgium. He took his vows to the Dominicans in Louvain and assumed the name of Luke. The Dominicans then sent him to Rome to study philosophy at Dominican House of Studies, the predecessor to the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas.

After finishing his philosophy coursework in 1769, he began studying theology at San Clemente al Laterano, a convent for seminarians run by the Irish Dominicans. He studied under Reverend Thomas Troy, who later became archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dublin. Concanen was fluent in Italian, and also knew Irish, English, Latin, French, and German.

=== Priesthood ===
Concanen was ordained a priest in the Dominican Order by Patriarch François Mattei on December 22, 1770, at the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome. He finished his theological studies in 1773, receiving the Dominican Lectorate of Sacred Theology.

After Concanen received his theology degree, the Dominicans assigned him as master of the Dominican novices at San Clemente in 1773. That same year, he joined the faculty at San Clemente and was named secretary of the convent council. By 1774, he had been named superior of San Clemente, and in 1775 he was its master of studies. However, feeling overloaded with these positions, Concaner resigned as master of studies the next year. Around this time, he was elected regent of the convent and in 1881 he was named its prior.

A gifted speaker with fluency in Italian, Concanen frequently preached in churches around Rome. He was appointed penitentiary-apostolic of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. In 1792/1793, he was named as theologian for the Biblioteca Casanatense, the Dominican library in Rome. He also served as an agent or secretary of the Irish Catholic bishops. He also assisted the English prelates and Bishop John Carroll in Baltimore, Maryland. 

Pope Pius VI nominated Concanen as Bishop of Kilfenora and Apostolic Administrator of Kilmacduagh in 1798, but Concanen declined the appointment. In a letter to a friend, he explained:Conscious of my inability for the awful Episcopal Charge, I have, from the very beginning, renounced my appointment...I am resolved to live and die in the obscure and retired way of life I have chosen from my youth.In 1798, a French army under General Louis-Alexandre Berthier entered Rome, sent Pius VI into exile and ravaged both San Clemente and the Dominican House of Studies. During this period, Concanen served as administrator for the House of Studies. Deeply interested in the Catholic missions in the new United States, Concanen was instrumental in persuading the Dominicans in the early 19th century to send Reverend Edward Fenwick to set up a Dominican province in that nation. Concanen made large financial contributions to St. Rose Priory, established by Fenwick in Springfield, Kentucky, as the first Dominican priory in the United States. Concanen later bequeathed his personal library to St. Rose.

=== Bishop of New York ===
On April 8, 1808, Concanen was appointed the first bishop of the newly erected Diocese of New York by Pope Pius VII. As with his appointment as bishop of Kilfenora in 1798, Concanen tried to decline the appointment. At that time, he was in poor health. However, he quickly changed his mind. Concanen received his episcopal consecration in Rome on April 24, 1808, from Cardinal Michele di Pietro, with Archbishops Tommaso Arezzo and Benedetto Sinibaldi serving as co-consecrators. 

Soon after his consecration, Concanen attempted to sail from Livorno, Italy, on an American ship to New York City. However, since that ship had also visited the United Kingdom, then at war with France, French authorities in Tuscany had stopped it from leaving port. He then considered traveling through France to a different port, but believed he was too weak to tolerate the long overland trip. Concanen also feared being arrested by the Napoleonic government in France and having papal documents confiscated. He remained in Livorno for four months trying to find another ship, then returned to Rome. 

In July 1808, Concanen wrote to Carroll, asking him to appoint a vicar general to serve as Concanen&#x27;s representative in New York; Carroll appointed Reverend Anthony Kohlman, a Jesuit priest, to fill the position in late 1809. Already working in New York, Kohlman had established the first St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in that city earlier that year. 

In June 1810, having heard of an American ship with permission to sail from the Kingdom of Naples to Boston, Massachusetts, Concanen traveled to Naples. However, soon after arriving there, the Kingdom authorities, allied with the French, denied him permission to board the ship because he was an Irish national. Very disappointed, Concanen remarked to one of his companions, &quot;Well, now I may say a farewell to America forever.&quot;

=== Death and legacy ===
Concanen died on June 19, 1810, in Naples at age 62, two days after being refused permission to sail. He was interred in the vault of the Dominican Church of San Domenico Maggiore in Naples. 

On July 9, 1978, Cardinal Terence Cooke of New York, accompanied by Auxiliary Bishops Anthony F. Mestice and Patrick V. Ahern, traveled to Naples to attach a commemorative plaque to Concanen&#x27;s tomb in the church.

<doc id="245273" wikidata="Q770100" url="?curid=245273" title="Erin">
<text>Erin is a personal name taken from the Hiberno-English word for Ireland, originating from the Irish word &quot;Éirinn&quot;. &quot;Éirinn&quot; is the dative case of the Irish word for Ireland, &quot;Éire&quot;, genitive &quot;Éireann&quot;, the dative being used in prepositional phrases such as &quot;go hÉirinn&quot; &quot;to Ireland&quot;, &quot;in Éirinn&quot; &quot;in Ireland&quot;, &quot;ó Éirinn&quot; &quot;from Ireland&quot;.

The dative has replaced the nominative in a few regional Irish dialects (particularly Galway-Connemara and Waterford). Poets and nineteenth-century Irish nationalists used &quot;Erin&quot; in English as a romantic name for Ireland. Often, &quot;Erin&#x27;s Isle&quot; was used. In this context, along with Hibernia, Erin is the name given to the female personification of Ireland, but the name was rarely used as a given name, probably because no saints, queens, or literary figures were ever called Erin.

According to Irish mythology and folklore, the name was originally given to the island by the Milesians after the goddess &quot;Ériu&quot;.

The phrase Erin go bragh (&quot;Éire go brách&quot; in standard orthography, dative &quot;in Éirinn go brách&quot; &quot;in Ireland forever&quot;), a slogan associated with the United Irishmen Rebellion of 1798, is often translated as &quot;Ireland forever&quot;. The songs &#x27;Let Erin Remember&#x27; and &#x27;Érin grá mo chroí&#x27; are more examples of the word&#x27;s usage in Irish romantic nationalism.

==Usage as a given or family name==
As a given name, Erin is used for both sexes, although, given its origins, it is principally used as a feminine forename. It first became a popular given name in the United States. Its US popularity for males peaked in 1974 with 321 boys registered with the name. &quot;Erin&quot; is also a name for Ireland in Welsh, and is one of the 20 most popular girls&#x27; names in Wales. 

As a family name, Erin has been used as one of the many spellings of the name of the Scottish clan &quot;Irwin&quot;—which was involved in the Scottish Plantations of Ireland. However, that name was originally derived from the place of the same name near Dumfries, and means &quot;green water&quot;, from Brittonic &quot;ir afon&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, an L&quot;-functionis a [[meromorphic]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] on the [[complex plane]], associated to one out of several categories of [[mathematical object]]s. An L&quot;-series is a Dirichlet series, usually convergent on a half-plane, that may give rise to an &quot;L&quot;-function via analytic continuation. The Riemann zeta function is an example of an &quot;L&quot;-function, and some important conjectures involving &quot;L&quot;-functions are the Riemann hypothesis and its generalizations.

The theory of &quot;L&quot;-functions has become a very substantial, and still largely conjectural, part of contemporary analytic number theory. In it, broad generalisations of the Riemann zeta function and the &quot;L&quot;-series for a Dirichlet character are constructed, and their general properties, in most cases still out of reach of proof, are set out in a systematic way. Because of the Euler product formula there is a deep connection between &quot;L&quot;-functions and the theory of prime numbers.

The mathematical field that studies &quot;L&quot;-functions is sometimes called analytic theory of &quot;L&quot;-functions.

== Construction ==

We distinguish at the outset between the L&quot;-series, an infinite series representation (for example the Dirichlet series for the Riemann zeta function), and the L&quot;-function, the function in the complex plane that is its analytic continuation. The general constructions start with an &quot;L&quot;-series, defined first as a Dirichlet series, and then by an expansion as an Euler product indexed by prime numbers. Estimates are required to prove that this converges in some right half-plane of the complex numbers. Then one asks whether the function so defined can be analytically continued to the rest of the complex plane (perhaps with some poles).

It is this (conjectural) meromorphic continuation to the complex plane which is called an &quot;L&quot;-function. In the classical cases, already, one knows that useful information is contained in the values and behaviour of the &quot;L&quot;-function at points where the series representation does not converge. The general term &quot;L&quot;-function here includes many known types of zeta functions. The Selberg class is an attempt to capture the core properties of &quot;L&quot;-functions in a set of axioms, thus encouraging the study of the properties of the class rather than of individual functions.

== Conjectural information ==

One can list characteristics of known examples of &quot;L&quot;-functions that one would wish to see generalized:

* location of zeros and poles;
* functional equation, with respect to some vertical line Re(&quot;s&quot;) = constant;
* interesting values at integers related to quantities from algebraic &quot;K&quot;-theory.

Detailed work has produced a large body of plausible conjectures, for example about the exact type of functional equation that should apply. Since the Riemann zeta function connects through its values at positive even integers (and negative odd integers) to the Bernoulli numbers, one looks for an appropriate generalisation of that phenomenon. In that case results have been obtained for &quot;p&quot;-adic &quot;L&quot;-functions, which describe certain Galois modules.

The statistics of the zero distributions are of interest because of their connection to problems like the generalized Riemann hypothesis, distribution of prime numbers, etc. The connections with random matrix theory and quantum chaos are also of interest. The fractal structure of the distributions has been studied using rescaled range analysis. The self-similarity of the zero distribution is quite remarkable, and is characterized by a large fractal dimension of 1.9. This rather large fractal dimension is found over zeros covering at least fifteen orders of magnitude for the Riemann zeta function, and also for the zeros of other &quot;L&quot;-functions of different orders and conductors.

== Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture ==
One of the influential examples, both for the history of the more general &quot;L&quot;-functions and as a still-open research problem, is the conjecture developed by Bryan Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer in the early part of the 1960s. It applies to an elliptic curve &quot;E&quot;, and the problem it attempts to solve is the prediction of the rank of the elliptic curve over the rational numbers (or another global field): i.e. the number of free generators of its group of rational points. Much previous work in the area began to be unified around a better knowledge of &quot;L&quot;-functions. This was something like a paradigm example of the nascent theory of &quot;L&quot;-functions.

== Rise of the general theory ==

This development preceded the Langlands program by a few years, and can be regarded as complementary to it: Langlands&#x27; work relates largely to Artin &quot;L&quot;-functions, which, like Hecke &quot;L&quot;-functions, were defined several decades earlier, and to &quot;L&quot;-functions attached to general automorphic representations.

Gradually it became clearer in what sense the construction of Hasse–Weil zeta functions might be made to work to provide valid &quot;L&quot;-functions, in the analytic sense: there should be some input from analysis, which meant &quot;automorphic&quot; analysis. The general case now unifies at a conceptual level a number of different research programs.

<doc id="245284" wikidata="Q678539" url="?curid=245284" title="Earl of Sandwich">
<text>Earl of Sandwich is a noble title in the Peerage of England, held since its creation by the House of Montagu. It is nominally associated with Sandwich, Kent. It was created in 1660 for the prominent naval commander Admiral Sir Edward Montagu. He was made Baron Montagu of St Neots, of St Neots in the County of Huntingdon, and Viscount Hinchingbrooke, at the same time, also in the Peerage of England. The viscountcy is used as the courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. A member of the prominent Montagu family, Lord Sandwich was the son of Sir Sidney Montagu, youngest brother of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (from whom the Dukes of Manchester descend), and Edward Montagu, 1st Baron Montagu of Boughton (from whom the Dukes of Montagu descended).

He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He briefly represented Dover in the House of Commons and served as Ambassador to Portugal and as Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire.

The second Earl&#x27;s great-grandson was The 4th Earl of Sandwich, who was a prominent statesman and served as First Lord of the Admiralty and as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Lord Sandwich is also remembered for sponsoring the voyages of discovery made by Captain James Cook, R.N., who named the Sandwich Islands in his honour, and as the namesake of the sandwich.

He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Brackley and Huntingdonshire and served as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and as Master of the Buckhounds. His son, the sixth Earl, also represented Huntingdonshire in Parliament.

He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He held office in the first two Conservative administrations of the Earl of Derby as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Master of the Buckhounds and was also Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire. His eldest son, the eighth Earl, represented Huntingdon in the House of Commons as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire.

He was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of Rear-Admiral the Hon. Victor Alexander Montagu, second son of the seventh Earl. Lord Sandwich was Member of Parliament for Huntingdon and Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire.

His son, the tenth Earl, represented South Dorset in Parliament as a Conservative from 1941 to 1962, when he succeeded his father in the earldom and had to resign his seat in the House of Commons and enter the House of Lords. He disclaimed his peerages in 1964 but never returned to the House of Commons.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, John Montagu, the 11th Earl of Sandwich, who succeeded him in 1995. John Montagu was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat as a cross-bencher.

The twelfth and current Earl succeeded his father in 2025. Lord Sandwich is known for his philanthropy, and was once Director at the MetFilm School.

Today the family seat is at Mapperton in Dorset. From the 17th century until the 1960s, the family also owned Hinchingbrooke House in Huntingdonshire, now a school, from which the title Viscount Hinchingbrooke was derived.

Some historical papers of the family and its Hinchingbrooke estate are held by Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Huntingdon.

<doc id="245286" wikidata="Q155975" url="?curid=245286" title="Kutná Hora">
<text>Kutná Hora (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 22,000 inhabitants. The history of Kutná Hora is linked to silver mining, which made it a rich and rapidly developing town. The centre of Kutná Hora, including the Sedlec Abbey and the Sedlec Ossuary, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 because of its outstanding architecture and its influence on subsequent architectural developments in other Central European city centres. The historic town centre is also protected as an urban monument reservation, the fourth largest in the Czech Republic.

The large concentration of monuments and its inclusion on the UNESCO list make Kutná Hora a significant tourist destination. The town&#x27;s sacral monuments are among the most important and most visited monuments in the Czech Republic. In addition to tourism, the town&#x27;s economy also includes industry, which is represented by production of tobacco products and the electrical engineering industry.

==Administrative division==
Kutná Hora consists of 12 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Kutná Hora-Vnitřní Město (2,813)
*Hlouška (5,156)
*Kaňk (813)
*Karlov (653)
*Malín (991)
*Neškaredice (164)
*Perštejnec (52)
*Poličany (187)
*Sedlec (1,138)
*Šipší (4,439)
*Vrchlice (364)
*Žižkov (3,390)
==Etymology==
The name of the town was derived from the eponymous mountain ( = &#x27;mountain&#x27;). According to legends, the name of the mountain was derived from the monks&#x27; cowls (&quot;Kutten&quot; in German, &quot;kutny&quot; in Czech). However, it is more likely that it derived from the Middle High German word &quot;kutte&quot; (&#x27;pit&#x27;). The name can also be derived from the Czech words &quot;kutit&quot; (&#x27;to work&#x27;) or &quot;kutat&quot; (&#x27;to mine&#x27;), but the Czech origin of the name is less likely.

==Geography==
Kutná Hora is located about east of Prague. The eastern part of the municipal territory lies in a flat agricultural landscape in the Central Elbe Table. The western part lies in the Upper Sázava Hills and includes the highest point of Kutná Hora, which is the hill Malý Kuklík at above sea level. The Vrchlice Stream flows through the town.

==History==

===Bronze Age and Iron Age===
Archaeological finds show that the area around the Kaňk hill was populated by Celts during the Hallstatt and La Tène periods. At the Celtic settlement site between Libenice and Kaňk, numerous ceramic finds from the 5th–1st century BC were discovered in 1981. One of the most important finds is a smelting furnace with 10 kg of slag from the 2nd–1st century BC with traces of pyrrhotine, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and copper, which also testify to early underground mining in the Kaňk hill.

===Establishment===

The earliest traces of silver have been found dating back to the 10th century, when Bohemia already had been in the crossroads of long-distance trade for many centuries. Silver dinars from the period between 985–995 were discovered in the settlement of Malín, which is now a part of Kutná Hora.

In 1142, the Sedlec Abbey, the first Cistercian monastery in Bohemia, was founded in the area of Sedlec by the monks from the Waldsassen Abbey in Bavaria. The abbey&#x27;s economic problems were solved by the discovery of silver near Sedlec, which attracted new settlers, especially from nearby German-speaking regions. Silver began to be mined in 1260. In the early days of mining, several nameless settlements emerged. The first mention of Kutná Hora (under its Latin name &quot;Mons Cuthna&quot;) is from 1289.

===Middle Ages===

In 1300, King Wenceslaus II issued the new royal mining code &quot;&quot;. This was a legal document that specified all administrative as well as technical terms and conditions necessary for the operation of mines. Shortly after 1300, Kutná Hora became the seat of the central mint of the Czech lands, in which Prague groschen were minted. The town gradually became the second most important town of the Kingdom of Bohemia (after Prague) and its main financial centre.

In December 1402, the town was sacked by King Sigismund after the imprisonment of Wenceslaus IV. It was heavily defended by its residents. After several bloody skirmishes, Sigismund prevailed and forced the defenders to march to Kolín and kneel in subjugation. Although Sigismund was successful in his conquest, his hetman Markvart of Úlice died after being struck by an arrow during the siege on 27 December.

On 18 January 1409, King Wenceslaus IV signed the Decree of Kutná Hora in the town, by which the Czech university nation was given three votes in the elections to the faculty of Prague University as against one for the three other nations.

In 1420, Sigismund made the town the base for his unsuccessful attack on the Taborites during the Hussite Wars, leading to the Battle of Kutná Hora. The development of the town was interrupted in 1421, when the Hussites burned down the Sedlec Abbey and captured Kutná Hora. In 1422–1424, part of the German population was expelled and the town was hit by two large fires. Silver mining was restored in 1469. Religious peace of Kutná Hora was concluded in Kutná Hora in 1485.

===Modern era===

Due to the threat of flooding in the deepest mines and the decreasing potency of silver ore, mining in Kutná Hora was reduced in the 1530s. The most important mining zone was closed in 1543. The production of the Prague groschen terminated in 1547. Despite these events, the remaining activities of the town were sufficient to ensure Kutná Hora&#x27;s prosperity.

As a result of the Battle of White Mountain, religious freedom began to be violated. In 1626, Jesuits were invited to Kutná Hora and built here a college. The Thirty Years&#x27; War caused economic difficulties. Mining was stopped in 1625. Two major raids by the Swedish army in 1639 and 1643 caused extensive damage to the town and a reduction in population. The town&#x27;s economic recovery occurred at the end of the 1650s with the development of crafts. The town also began to be a centre of education thanks to the Jesuits.

At the beginning of the 18th century, there were attempts to open new silver mines. However, the new silver veins were thin and therefore unprofitable. In 1727, the mint was closed and Kutná Hora definitely ceased to be a mining town. At the beginning of the 19th century, Kutná Hora was still among the larger towns in the Czech lands, but its importance was declining.

Until 1918, the town was the capital of the district of the same name in Austria-Hungary, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia. Together with the rest of Bohemia, the town became part of the newly founded Czechoslovakia after World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
A factory for production of tobacco products was founded in Kutná Hora in 1812 and is located in the premises of the former Cistercian monastery in Sedlec. In 1882, production of cigarettes began. From 1992, the factory is owned by Philip Morris ČR, a subsidiary of Philip Morris International. In Kutná Hora, the company employs more than 800 people.

The largest employer with headquarters in Kutná Hora is Foxconn Technology CZ, a manufacturer of electronic components with more than 1,500 employees.

==Transport==
The I/2 road from Prague to Pardubice passes through the town.

Kutná Hora is located on the railway lines Prague–Brno and Kutná Hora-Zruč nad Sázavou. The town is served by four stations: &quot;Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží&quot;, &quot;Kutná Hora město&quot;, &quot;Kutná Hora předměstí&quot; and &quot;Kutná Hora-Sedlec&quot;.

==Sights==

Since 1961, the historic town centre is protected as an urban monument reservation, the fourth largest in the Czech Republic with an area of . In 1995, the centre of Kutná Hora, including the Sedlec area, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its outstanding architecture and its influence on subsequent architectural developments in other Central European city centres.

The most valuable monuments in the town centre, protected as national cultural monuments, are the Church of Saint Barbara and the Italian Court, but the historic town centre also includes more than 300 other cultural monuments. In 2023, the Sedlec area and the Church of Saint Barbara were visited by 290 and 250 thousand people respectively, making them one of the most important tourist destinations of the region and the 2nd and 3rd most visited sacral monuments in the Czech Republic (after Svatá Hora in Příbram).

===National cultural monuments===

The Italian Court was built in the Gothic style between 1260 and 1300. It is the oldest monument in Kutná Hora. It was originally a part of the town&#x27;s fortification system. In 1300, it became the seat of the royal mint, which was in operation until 1727. In the 1380s, another building was added, which served as a royal residence. The Italian Court is a complex of several buildings, the youngest of which were built in 1893–1898, when several dilapidated buildings were demolished and replaced under the leadership of the architect Ludvík Lábler, but the most valuable part of the complex was preserved. Of particular value and international distinction is the Chapel of Saints Wenceslaus and Ladislaus from around 1400.

The Church of Saint Barbara is among the main examples of European Gothic architecture. It was built in 1385–1395, on a site that was originally located outside the town walls, when there was already a chapel dedicated to St. Barbara. The cathedral was to represent the wealth of the town and was to compete with the nearby cathedral in Sedlec, as well as St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague. The construction project was created by Peter Parler and the construction was completed by Johann Parler. Architects and builders Master Hanuš, Matěj Rejsek and Benedikt Rejt participated in further construction stages in the 15th century. The purist reconstruction that took place from the 1880s until 1905 and was carried out by Josef Mocker and Ludvík Lábler is also considered valuable. The church complex includes a free-standing Chapel of Corpus Christi, originally a charnel house. It was also built in the Gothic style at the end of the 14th century.

===Other monuments in the historic town centre===
Next to the Church of Saint Barbara is the Jesuit College, also an important landmark of the town. It was designed by the architect Giovanni Domenico Orsi and the construction of this early Baroque building started in 1666. After Orsi&#x27;s death in 1676, the construction was continued by Carlo Lurago. Construction continued throughout the 18th century, but was never completed to the planned extent. An important part of the complex is the promenade to the Church of St. Barbara with sculptural decoration by František Baugut.

The so-called Stone House ( is a late Gothic burgher house from the 1480s. Since 1902, it houses the Museum of Silver.

Hrádek was originally a wooden fortress from 1312, rebuilt into a small castle in 1400–1420 and then completely rebuilt into a palace at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. A Jesuit seminary was established in its premises in 1686. It was used by the Jesuits until the abolishment of the order in 1773. From 1910, it was owned by the Kutná Hora town. Since 1947, it has been used by the Museum of Silver.

A notable technical monument is a dodecagon-shaped stone fountain, situated on today&#x27;s Rejsek Square. It was probably created by Matěj Rejsek and is sometimes called Rejsek&#x27;s Fountain. From its construction in 1495 until 1663, it served as a drinking water reservoir. It solved the absence of water sources that were disrupted by mining activities. The late Gothic fountain is unique not only in its dimensions, but also in the material used, which was not common in other fountains in the town.

The plague column in Kutná Hora was created by the Jesuit sculptor František Baugut in 1714–1715. It is a sculturally valuable Baroque work, created as a pieta for those who died during the plague epidemic in 1713. The top of the column is decorated by the statue of the Virgin Mary Immaculate. The pedestal is decorated by statues of saints and miners, typical for Kutná Hora.

====Churches====

A prominent building is the Church of Saint James the Great, located next to the Italian Court. It was built in the Gothic style in 1300–1370 and modiefied during the reconstructions at the end of the 19th century and in 1941–1946. It is a monumental church with a high tower.

The Church of Saint John of Nepomuk was built in the Baroque style in 1734–1752, on the site of houses that was destroyed by the 1730 fire. It was built according to the design by František Maxmilián Kaňka, but other important artists of the Baroque era also participated in its creation. Today it serves mainly for cultural purposes.

The Church of Our Lady &quot;Na Náměti&quot; is a late Gothic building with neo-Gothic modifications. The oldest part of the church dates from the beginning of the 14th century. The church was damaged by fires in 1770 and 1823, but the late Gothic style still prevails today.

In 1712, the Ursulines arrived to Kutná Hora. The Ursuline Convent was built in the Baroque style in 1738–1743 according to the design by Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer, but only three wings were completed. Next to the convent is the neo-Baroque Church of the Sacred Heart, designed by Friedrich Ohmann and built in 1897–1901. Today, part of the convent is used as a school, part is used by the National Heritage Institute, and part has been returned to the order. The cellars are used commercially as wine cellars.

===Sedlec===

The Sedlec suburb of Kutná Hora is known for the Sedlec Abbey with the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist. Founded in 1142, the monastery was founded in 1142, but most of the monastery complex was built in the second half of the 13th century. The large complex had an area of at its peak and belonged to the largest and wealthiest monasteries of the Czech lands in the Middle Ages. At the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries, the church acquired a unique Baroque-Gothic form according to the design of the architect Jan Santini Aichel.

Near the abbey is the Church of All Saints, known for the Sedlec Ossuary. The ossuary was a cemetery chapel, built at the end of the 14th century and modified in the Baroque style at the beginning of the 18th century by Jan Santini Aichel. It is estimated that the ossuary is decorated with bones of more than 40,000 skeletons that belonged to those who died from plague epidemics and the Hussite Wars. The unique decoration, the main element of which is a chandelier composed of all the large bones of the human body, was created by the carver František Rint. The cemetery around the church was used in the 13th–16th centuries. Today it is an archaeological site where 30 mass graves have been identified.

===Malín===
The village of Malín used to be a site of an early medieval gord. The main landmark of Malín is the Church of Saint Stephen. Originally a Romanesque building, it was rebuilt in the Gothic style in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1710, it was rebuilt into its current Baroque form. Next to the church is a separate wooden bell tower from the end of the 15th century. Malín gave its name to Malin, Oregon.

<doc id="245296" wikidata="Q13844" url="?curid=245296" title="Leyte (province)">
<text>Leyte (also Northern Leyte; ; Cebuano: &quot;Amihanang Leyte&quot;; ), officially the Province of Leyte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region occupying the northern three-quarters of Leyte Island (with the remaining portion being the province of Southern Leyte). Its capital (and largest city) is the city of Tacloban, administered independently from the province, as well as the regional center of Eastern Visayas. Leyte is thus north of Southern Leyte, south of Biliran, and west of Samar Island. To the west across the Camotes Sea is the province of Cebu.

The historical name of the Philippines, &quot;Las Islas Felipenas&quot;, named by Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos in honor of Prince Philip of Spain, used to refer to the islands of Leyte and Samar only, until it was adopted to refer to the entire archipelago.

The island of Leyte is known as Tandaya during the 16th century.

Leyte is also known as the site of the largest naval battle in modern history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which took place during the Second World War.

Leyte is especially prone to typhoons because it geographically faces toward the Pacific Ocean. On 8 November 2013, the province was severely affected by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). The typhoon, known internationally as Haiyan, and domestically referred to as Yolanda, killed thousands of people and garnered significant international media attention. Leyte suffered similar destruction and loss of life in 1991 from Tropical Storm Thelma.

==History==
===Early history===
The island of Leyte was once the location of &quot;Mairete&quot;, meaning &quot;land of Ete&quot;, a historic community which was ruled by Datu Ete centered in present-day municipality of Leyte and nearby towns. It was the oldest city-state in the entire Eastern Visayas region. Before being colonized by Spain, the island was once home to indigenous animist Warays to the East and other indigenous Hindu-Buddhist Visayan groups to the west.

===Spanish colonial era===
The Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos, first came to the island in 1543 and named it &quot;Las Islas Felipinas&quot;. When the Spanish government established government in Cebu, Leyte and Samar became part of the province of Cebu. In 1595, the religious Jesuits established mission in Carigara which preceded the mission established in Palo in 1596 and Ormoc and Alangalang missions in 1597. In 1735, Leyte and Samar were separated from Cebu to be established as a single provincial government with Carigara as the first provincial capital. Leyte had jurisdiction over Samar. In 1768, Leyte and Samar were split into two separate provinces.

===American colonial era===
On March 27, 1923, &quot;Act No 3117&quot; was proposed to divide Leyte into &quot;Occidental Leyte&quot; and &quot;Oriental Leyte&quot; but was not proclaimed by the Governor-General of the Philippines.

===Japanese occupation===
During the World War II era, the Leyte Provincial Capitol briefly became the seat of the Philippine Commonwealth Government.

====Battle of Leyte Gulf====
The Battle of Leyte Gulf took place in the seas surrounding this island from October 23 to 26, 1944. It was the largest naval battle in modern history, when at least 212 Allied ships clashed with the remnants of the Imperial Japanese Navy, some 60 ships, including the super battleships Yamato and Musashi.

The First Battle of Leyte occurred on October 20, 1944. A successful Allied invasion of the island was the crucial element to the eventual Filipino and American victory in the Philippines.
===Contemporary===
On April 8, 1959, Biliran became a sub-province of Leyte by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 2141&quot;. On May 22, 1959, &quot;Republic Act No. 2227&quot; was passed into law that separated the third Congressional District of Leyte, then comprising the southern portion of the namesake island, into a separate province of Southern Leyte. 

On May 11, 1992, Biliran was separated from Leyte to become an independent province, by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 7160&quot;.

===Proposed creation of Western Leyte===
In November 2024, 4th District Representative Richard Gomez filed House Bill No. 11077, seeking to create Western Leyte, which would cover two cities (Ormoc and Baybay) and 16 municipalities (Albuera, Bato, Calubian, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan, Isabel, Kananga, Leyte, Matag-ob, Matalom, Merida, Palompon, San Isidro, Tabango, and Villaba) where Cebuano is predominantly spoken. The remaining areas of Leyte, where Waray is predominantly spoken, would remain intact. However, the proposal was met by opposition from Leyte Governor Carlos Jericho Petilla, 41 of 42 mayors in Leyte, and the Sangguniang Bayan (municipal council) of Palompon.

==Geography==

Leyte covers a total area of , occupying the northern and central sections of Leyte Island in the Eastern Visayas region. The province is situated west of Samar Island, north of Southern Leyte, south of Biliran, and east of the Camotes Sea.

===Administrative divisions===
Leyte comprises 40 municipalities and three cities, all clustered into 6 congressional districts.

Ormoc is an &quot;independent component city&quot;, while the capital Tacloban was declared a &quot;highly urbanized city&quot; in 2008. Both cities govern themselves independently of the province and their residents do not vote for elective provincial officials.

Baybay attained cityhood in 2007 but reverted to its municipal status when the Supreme Court declared its city charter unconstitutional in 2008. It regained its city status following the reversal of the Supreme Court decision dated December 22, 2009. In August 2010, however, a resolution had been passed reverting 16 cities, one of which was Baybay, to municipal status. It was on February 15, 2011, that the Supreme Court reversed its decision once again, allowing Baybay, along with the other 16 cities, to retain their cityhood status.



==Demographics==

The population of Leyte in the 2020 census was 1,776,847 people, with a density of . When Tacloban is included for geographical purposes, the population comes to 1,966,768 people, with a density of .

The people of Leyte province are subdivided into two closely related Visayan ethnolinguistic groups. In the northern, central and eastern parts are the Warays and in the western part are the Cebuanos.

Tacloban-Waray dialect is considered as the standard form of Waray language and is used as the de facto lingua franca in both Leyte and Samar Islands. Aside from Cebuano and Waray, most Leyteños can also speak and understand Filipino and English. Some students who have studied the Spanish language and a few descendants of Spanish colonists can also speak and understand Spanish.

Leyte is predominantly a Roman Catholic Christian province. The 2000 census stated that 97% of Leyte&#x27;s population adhered to Roman Catholicism, one of the highest percentages in the Visayas. The remaining 3% were adherents of other different Christian denominations and sects, such as the indigenous Iglesia ni Cristo, the Kingdom of Jesus Christ and Members Church of God International, popularly known as &quot;Ang Dating Daan&quot;, and many other foreign religious groups like the Mormons, Born Again Christians, Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-Day Adventists (&quot;Sabadistas&quot;), and many more.

Islam is also present in the province and concentrated in the metropolitan Tacloban area. It comprises 0.3% of Tacloban City&#x27;s population, and its adherents are mainly the Maranao people and other Moro migrants from Mindanao who work mostly as traders.

==Official provincial seal==
The upper portion is a perspective of the national Freedom Park commemorating the landing of General Douglas MacArthur and the American Liberation Forces in Leyte during World War II. The white cross represents the 2nd phase of Leyte&#x27;s development when Magellan stopped here on his way to Cebu. The alphabet on the cross argent is the ancient Visayan paleographic syllabary of the letter L which stands for Leyte. The stars around the inner circle symbolize the forty-one towns of Leyte and the everlasting flame symbolizes the soldiers who died during World War II.
==Economy==

The economy of Leyte is a mixed agriculture, fishing, industrial, energy and mining. Rice is farmed in the lowland plains areas specifically those around Tacloban, while coconut farming, is the main cash crop in upland and mountainous areas. Sugarcane plantation is no. 1 produce in Ormoc City. Since Leyte is an island province, fishing is a major source of livelihood among coastal residents.

The province is the site of the largest geothermal power plant in Asia, making it one of the resource-rich provinces of the Philippines. Excess energy of the numerous powerplants in the geothermal valley that generate electricity is supplied to the national grid that adds to the energy demand in Luzon and Mindanao. Mining industry has started to pick up in the province with the exploration in MacArthur. The iron smelting in Isabel has been operational for more than 20 years since its inception.

===Leyte ICT Park===
The Leyte Information Communications Technology (ICT) Park is one of the economic zones approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). Located at Pawing, Palo, Leyte, the 6.8 facility hosts two business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, namely, the Expert Global Solutions (EGS) Company (formerly APAC Customer Services, Inc.) and ACUDATA, Inc. (a financial and data services BPO). However, EGS decided to fully close its operations after its facility was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.

Leyte is emerging to be an ICT-BPO Hub for Eastern Visayas.

==Transportation==
Leyte is connected by air with its only commercial airport located in Tacloban City. Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport, which is one of the busiest airports in the Philippines, is served by three major airlines, Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific and AirAsia. Tacloban Airport primarily serves connecting flights from major Philippine cities (Manila and Cebu).

Philtranco, which has a bus stop in Tacloban and Ormoc, operates a route along Manila-Maharlika highway, passing through Allen, Northern Samar in Samar Island (via ferry boat) from Matnog, Sorsogon in Bicol region.

Commercial seaport is of vital importance. Major ports of the province are located at Ormoc City, in the south and Tacloban City, in the north. Small ports are also located in Palompon, San Isidro, Bato, Hilongos and Baybay.

<doc id="245298" wikidata="Q3748370" url="?curid=245298" title="Barcan formula">
<text>In quantified modal logic, the Barcan formula and the converse Barcan formula (more accurately, schemata rather than formulas) (i) syntactically state principles of interchange between quantifiers and modalities; (ii) semantically state a relation between domains of possible worlds. The formulas were introduced as axioms by Ruth Barcan Marcus, in the first extensions of modal propositional logic to include quantification.

Related formulas include the Buridan formula.

== The Barcan formula ==

The Barcan formula is:

:formula_1.

In English, the schema reads: If every x is necessarily F, then it is necessary that every x is F. It is equivalent to

:formula_2.

The Barcan formula has generated some controversy because—in terms of possible world semantics—it implies that all objects which exist in any possible world (accessible to the actual world) exist in the actual world, i.e. that domains cannot grow when one moves to accessible worlds. This thesis is sometimes known as actualism—i.e. that there are no &quot;merely&quot; possible individuals. There is some debate as to the informal interpretation of the Barcan formula and its converse.

An informal argument against the plausibility of the Barcan formula would be the interpretation of the predicate &quot;Fx&quot; as &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a machine that can tap all the energy locked in the waves of the Atlantic Ocean in a practical and efficient way&quot;. In its equivalent form above, the antecedent formula_3 seems plausible since it is at least theoretically possible that such a machine could exist. However, it is not obvious that this implies that there exists a machine that possibly could tap the energy of the Atlantic.

== Converse Barcan formula ==
The converse Barcan formula is:

:formula_4.

It is equivalent to

:formula_5.

If a frame is based on a symmetric accessibility relation, then the Barcan formula will be valid in the frame if, and only if, the converse Barcan formula is valid in the frame. It states that domains cannot shrink as one moves to accessible worlds, i.e. that individuals cannot cease to exist. The converse Barcan formula is taken to be more plausible than the Barcan formula.

<doc id="245303" wikidata="Q671382" url="?curid=245303" title="Chess prodigy">
<text>A chess prodigy is a young child who possesses an aptitude for the game of chess that far exceeds what might be expected at their age. Their prodigious talent will often enable them to defeat experienced adult players and even titled chess masters. Some chess prodigies have progressed to become grandmasters or even World Chess Champions.

==Early chess prodigies==
Early chess prodigies included Paul Morphy (1837–1884) and José Raúl Capablanca (1888–1942), both of whom won matches against strong adult opponents at the age of 12, and Samuel Reshevsky (1911–1992), who was giving simultaneous exhibitions at the age of six. Morphy went on to become the world&#x27;s leading player before the formal title of World Champion existed. Capablanca became the third World Champion, and Reshevsky—while never attaining the title—was amongst the world&#x27;s elite players for many decades. Jutta Hempel at the age of 6 played 12 simultaneous games and won 9.5-2.5.

Arturo Pomar (1931–2016) was another to be labelled a prodigy by chess writers. He played his first international tournament (Madrid 1943) at the age of 11 and went on to become Spain&#x27;s first grandmaster.

== Youngest to defeat a grandmaster ==
There is often widespread attention when a young player defeats a Grandmaster, whether in a standard tournament game or less formal conditions.

===Formal conditions===
The youngest player to defeat a grandmaster under standard time controls is Ashwath Kaushik, who in February 2024 defeated Jacek Stopa at the age of 8 years, 6 months, and 11 days.

The previous record was set by Leonid Ivanovic, who in January 2024 defeated Milko Popchev at the Novogodisnji rating ŠSB in Belgrade, Serbia at the age of 8 years, 11 months, and 7 days. 

Aarit Kapil, at just 9 years, 2 months, and 18 days old, has become the youngest Indian and the third youngest player worldwide to defeat a Grandmaster under classical time control.

===Informal conditions===

In 1976, a ten-year-old Nigel Short beat Viktor Korchnoi as a participant in a simultaneous exhibition, the only game Korchnoi lost in the event.

In 1999, David Howell defeated John Nunn in a blitz game at the age of eight.

In 2021, 10-year-old Frederick Waldhausen Gordon, from Scotland, won against GM Bogdan Lalic in an online rapid 10+5 game in the ECF Grand Prix Rapid Event 1 held on lichess.org.

In 2023, 8-year-old Roman Shogdzhiev, from Russia, defeated GM Jakhongir Vakhidov and GM Johan-Sebastian Christiansen in the World Rapid Chess Championship 2023, and after a couple of days defeated GM Kirill Shevchenko, GM Alan Pichot and GM Pranav V in the World Blitz Chess Championship 2023.

==List of youngest grandmasters==

Since 1950, when the Grandmaster (GM) title was introduced by FIDE, one measure of chess prodigies is the age at which they gain the GM title. Below are players who have held the record for the youngest grandmaster; the age listed is the age at which they qualified for the title. This is not equal to the age at which they officially became grandmasters, because GM titles can only be awarded at FIDE congresses. The country listed indicates the federation the player was affiliated with at the time of gaining the title, not their current or later affiliation. The first record holder was David Bronstein, who was the youngest of the 27 inaugural players to be awarded the title by FIDE in 1950 at age 26; the record is currently held by Abhimanyu Mishra, who qualified at age 12. 

This is a list of the players who fulfilled the requirements to attain the title of Grandmaster before their 14th birthday.
Note: Karjakin has changed federations since attaining the grandmaster title.

===List of youngest female grandmasters===
Below are the holders of the record for the youngest female player to qualify for the grandmaster title (not to be confused with the lesser Woman Grandmaster title):

<text>Treeswifts or crested swifts are a family, the Hemiprocnidae, of aerial near passerine birds, closely related to the true swifts. The family contains a single genus, Hemiprocne, with four species. They are distributed from India and Southeast Asia through Indonesia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

Treeswifts are small to medium-sized swifts, ranging in length from 15 to 30 cm. They have long wings, with most of the length coming from the length of the primaries; their arms are actually quite short. They visibly differ from the other swifts in matters of plumage, which is softer, and they have crests or other facial ornaments, and long, forked tails. Anatomically they are separated from the true swifts by skeletal details in the cranium and palate, the anatomy of the tarsus, and a nonreversible hind toe that is used for perching on branches (an activity in which true swifts are unable to engage). The males have iridescent mantle plumage. They also have diastataxic wings, that is they lack a fifth secondary feather unlike swifts in the Apodini, which are eutaxic.
The treeswifts exhibit a wide range of habitat preferences. One species, the whiskered treeswift, is a species belonging to primary forest. Highly manoeuvrable, it feeds close to vegetation beneath the canopy, and only rarely ventures into secondary forests or plantations, but never over open ground. Other species are less restricted; the crested treeswift makes use of a range of habitats including humid forests and deciduous woodland, and the grey-rumped treeswift occupies almost every habitat type available from the mangrove forests to hill forests. All species feed on insects, although exact details of what prey are taken has not been studied in detail.

Nest-building responsibilities are shared by the male and female. They lay one egg in the nest, which is glued to an open tree branch. Egg colour varies from white to grey. Little information is available about incubation times, but they are thought to be longer for the larger species. Chicks hatch with a covering of grey down and are fed a bolus of regurgitated food by the parents.

<doc id="245318" wikidata="Q206890" url="?curid=245318" title="Carrie-Anne Moss">
<text>Carrie-Anne Moss (born August 21, 1967) is a Canadian-American actress. After early roles on television, she rose to international prominence for her role of Trinity in &quot;The Matrix&quot; series (1999–present). She has starred in &quot;Memento&quot; (2000), for which she won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female, &quot;Red Planet&quot; (2000), &quot;Chocolat&quot; (2000), &quot;Fido&quot; (2006), &quot;Snow Cake&quot; (2006), for which she won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, &quot;Disturbia&quot; (2007), &quot;Unthinkable&quot; (2010), &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot; (2012), and &quot;Pompeii&quot; (2014). She also portrayed Jeri Hogarth in several television series produced by Marvel Television for Netflix, most notably &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2015–2019).

== Early life ==
Carrie-Anne Moss was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, the daughter of Barbara and Melvyn Moss. She has an older brother, Brooke. Moss&#x27;s mother reportedly named her after the Hollies&#x27; 1967 hit song, &quot;Carrie Anne&quot;, which had been released in May of that year. Moss lived with her mother in Vancouver as a child. At the age of 11, she joined the Vancouver children&#x27;s musical theatre and later went on to tour Europe with the Magee Secondary School Choir in her senior year.

== Career ==
=== 1990s and breakthrough ===
While living in Spain, Moss obtained a role as Tara, the clerk to Judge Nicholas Marshall in the drama series &quot;Dark Justice&quot;, her first television appearance. She moved from Barcelona to Los Angeles with the series in 1992. Moss left &quot;Dark Justice&quot; before the series&#x27; third and final season and was replaced by Elisa Heinsohn as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Collins. She enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena upon her return, and she subsequently starred in Fox&#x27;s primetime soap opera &quot;Models Inc.,&quot; a spin-off of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, as a model. The series was cancelled in July 1995. She headlined a short-lived made-in-Canada series entitled &quot;Matrix.&quot; For most of the 1990s, she appeared in several television series such as &quot;Street Justice&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;F/X: The Series&quot;, and &quot;Due South&quot;, for which she scored a nomination for the Gemini Award for Best Guest Actress in a Drama. Many of her film roles in the decade were in B movies, including &quot;Flashfire&quot; (1994), &quot;The Soft Kill&quot; (1994), &quot;Tough Guy&quot; (1994), &quot;Lethal Tender&quot; (1996), &quot;Sabotage&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Secret Life of Algernon&quot; (1997).

Her breakthrough role came when she played Trinity in the science-fiction thriller &quot;The Matrix&quot; (1999). Her role demanded extreme acrobatic actions, and she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting. The film grossed over US$460 million worldwide and was highly acclaimed by critics, some of whom have considered it one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made. Moss asserted that prior to being cast in &quot;The Matrix&quot;, she had &quot;no career&quot;. It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a &quot;New York Daily News&quot; interview, she stated, &quot;&quot;The Matrix&quot; gave me so many opportunities. Everything I&#x27;ve done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much.&quot; Moss was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress, and for the MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance.

=== 2000s ===
Moss had four film releases in 2000—&quot;Chocolat&quot;, &quot;Red Planet&quot;, &quot;The Crew&quot;, and &quot;Memento&quot;. In the romantic comedy &quot;Chocolat&quot;, she took on the role of Caroline Clairmont, a cold, devoutly pious woman living in a French village. As part of an overall positive response towards the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that Moss, &quot;as an upright widowed mother swathed in mournful baby blue, radiates glimmers of hurt; she shows it&#x27;s not easy to keep up such a front.&quot; The film made US$152 million at the international box office. The science-fiction thriller &quot;Red Planet&quot; had her play the commander and leader of a rescue mission to Mars. &quot;A.V. Club&quot; felt that Moss was &quot;largely reduced to worrying while modelling a series of tight-fitting space fashions&quot;. Despite a US$80 million budget, the film only grossed US$33 million worldwide. She appeared as detective Olivia Neal in the crime black comedy &quot;The Crew&quot;, directed by Michael Dinner.

In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s neo-noir psychological thriller &quot;Memento&quot;, she portrayed a manipulative bartender who meets a man suffering from anterograde amnesia. Producer Jennifer Todd suggested Moss for the part after being impressed by her performance in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Nolan decided to cast Moss as Natalie, saying, &quot;She added an enormous amount to the role of Natalie that wasn&#x27;t on the page&quot;. The film became a sleeper hit, being acclaimed by critics and earning US$39.7 million over a US$9 million budget. She won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female for her performance.

Moss reprised the role of Trinity in the back-to-back sequels &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;, both released in 2003. Like the original, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; received positive critical reception, and became a major box office hit, grossing US$742.1 million worldwide. &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; received a lukewarm critical reception, but made US$427.3 million globally. During an interview with BBC Online, Moss expressed her pride for starring in the franchise, which she described as a &quot;segment of [her] life&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s deep and it&#x27;s beautiful to have been part of it for so long. It&#x27;s pretty spectacular&quot;. She provided voiceovers for video game and animated spin-offs of the films.

In 2005, Moss starred in the little-seen thriller &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; as FBI agent Fran Kulok, and was part of an ensemble cast in the independent dramedy &quot;The Chumscrubber&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Moss next appeared in the zombie comedy &quot;Fido&quot; (2006), playing a housewife in a 1950s-esque alternate universe where radiation from space has turned the dead into zombies. She noted the &quot;very rich&quot; and &quot;very visual&quot; script for the film, and became drawn to the project for its &quot;underlying messages about control and domination&quot;. &quot;Fido&quot; was an opening night film at the Toronto International Film Festival, and received largely favourable reviews, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; calling it a &quot;crafty mixture of George A. Romero and Douglas Sirk.&quot; Moss played the neighbour of an autistic woman in the small-scale romantic drama &quot;Snow Cake&quot; (2006). It was released in selected theatres, to positive reviews from critics. Moss earned a nomination for Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.
In the Hitchcockian thriller &quot;Disturbia&quot; (2007), Moss portrayed the mother of a troubled teenager who suspects one of his neighbours is a serial killer. The film was met with a positive critical reception and made US$117.8 million around the globe. She played one of the people who are brought together in the wake of a deadly car accident in the independent drama &quot;Normal&quot; (2007), released for selected theatres. Moss appeared in the drama &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot;, which revolved around the inner lives and affairs of a family. The production premiered at the 2008 Berlin International Film Festival and was released theatrically in the United States in October 2011. She starred in the straight-to-DVD romantic comedy &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (2009).

=== 2010s ===
In the thriller &quot;Unthinkable&quot; (2010), directed by Gregor Jordan, Moss played the leader of an FBI counter-terrorism team assigned to interrogate a man who threatens to detonate three nuclear bombs in the United States. The film was released direct-to-DVD and generated controversy over its subject matter. She took on the role of antagonist Claudia Wolf in the sequel to the 2006 horror film &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot; (2012). Budgeted at US$20 million, the film grossed US$52.3 million worldwide, but garnered an overwhelmingly negative reception among film critics and fans alike. Mentioning Moss in its review for the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the supporting actors &quot;deserve much, much better&quot;. She voiced the character Aria in the video games &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; (2010) and &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot; (2012).

She had a four-episode arc in the series &quot;Chuck&quot; between 2011 and 2012, and played the regular role of Las Vegas Assistant District Attorney Katherine O&#x27;Connell in the CBS period drama series &quot;Vegas&quot;, which premiered in September 2012, but was cancelled after its first season, despite an overall positive response. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mike Hale felt that Moss &quot;feels out of place in this frontier tale, but looks great in snug wool suits&quot;. Moss obtained the role of Penelope, a California candidate for governor who runs a free health clinic, in the political thriller &quot;Knife Fight&quot; (2012), directed by Bill Guttentag. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was released for a two-theater run and digital platforms. Moss headlined the psychological dark comedy &quot;Compulsion&quot; (2013), in which she played one of two people occupying neighbouring apartments, each one grappling with psychological disorders that begin to overtake their lives. The film opened for limited release. She voiced the character of Admiral Wells in the fantasy animated film &quot;The Clockwork Girl&quot; (2014).

She starred in the 3D historical disaster picture &quot;Pompeii&quot; (2014), produced and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson. The film, inspired by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 that destroyed the Roman Empire city Pompeii, had her portray Aurelia, the wife of the city governor. In the independent drama &quot;Elephant Song&quot; (2014), directed by Charles Binamé, Moss starred as the wife of a psychiatrist. The film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, and in its review for the film, &quot;Variety&quot; described her role as &quot;a pushily self-centered second wife&quot; and found her part to be &quot;a poorly integrated subplot&quot; in the film. In 2015, she voiced a widowed mother in the made-for-television animated film &quot;Pirate&#x27;s Passage&quot;, was one of the narrators in the documentary &quot;Unity&quot;, and appeared as the wife of Victor Frankenstein in &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, an updated adaptation of Mary Shelley&#x27;s book.

In 2015, Moss appeared in &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; as Jeri Hogarth, an attorney and potentially powerful ally to the title character. The gender of the character was changed from male to female for the series, and the character was written as a lesbian. Moss signed on to the series after reading the first two scripts, having been pitched the character by producer Jeph Loeb and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg. She described the character by saying, &quot;she&#x27;s fierce, she&#x27;s strong, she&#x27;s powerful, and she likes that power&quot;. The web series premiered on Netflix, to critical acclaim. Moss has also reprised her role of Jeri Hogarth in the second-season finale of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, and has had recurring arcs in &quot;Iron Fist&quot; and &quot;The Defenders&quot;. Moss took on the lead role of Dr. Athena Morrow, an AI researcher invited to reverse engineer a consciousness program, in the second season of the science-fiction series &quot;Humans&quot;. Moss filmed a supporting part in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Bye Bye Man&quot; (2017), playing what &quot;Variety&quot; described as &quot;the world&#x27;s most soft-edged hard-bitten police detective&quot;. Despite negative reviews, the film grossed US$24 million worldwide on a budget of US$7 million.

=== 2020s ===
Moss returned to the Matrix film series in the 2021 film &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;, in which Moss reprises her role as Trinity. The film was released on December 22, 2021, in theaters and on HBO Max. The film overall received mixed reviews from critics, yet Moss&#x27;s performance as Trinity was again praised. Moss welcomed her return to the role, stating, &quot;Who am I if not Trinity?&quot;

== Personal life ==
Moss married Canadian actor Steven Roy in 1999, and they have two sons (b. 2003 and 2005) and a daughter (b. 2009). As of 2020, they live in New Hampshire. She is the founder of Annapurna Living, a lifestyle brand designed to empower women through mindfulness, meditation, and devotion. Moss stresses that her spiritual practice has been instrumental in navigating the &quot;rejection&quot; and stresses in the Hollywood movie business.

<text>Arnošt of Pardubice (, ; 25 March 1297 – 30 June 1364) was the first Archbishop of Prague (and the last bishop). He was also an advisor and diplomat to Emperor Charles IV.

==Life==
Arnošt of Pardubice was probably born in Hostinka (today part of Vestec), but possibly also in Kłodzko. He was the eldest son of Knight Arnošt of Hostinka, and spent his childhood in Kłodzko.

Arnošt inherited the town of Pardubice in 1340. He was confirmed bishop of Prague on 11 March 1343 (3 March 1343 O.S.), and was commissioned the first Archbishop of Prague on 8 May 1344 (30 April 1344 O.S.). He ordered the monks to contribute to the newly founded Charles University (14th century), hence enhancing the quality of the education in the institution.

<doc id="245327" wikidata="Q278020" url="?curid=245327" title="Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois">
<text>Jean-Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois (; 19 June 1749 – 8 June 1796) was a French actor, dramatist, essayist, and revolutionary. He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety during the Reign of Terror and, while he saved Madame Tussaud from the Guillotine, he administered the execution of more than 2,000 people in the city of Lyon.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, Collot left his home in the rue St. Jacques in his teens to join the travelling theatres of provincial France. His moderately successful career as an actor, supplemented by a vigorous outpouring of works for the stage, took him from Bordeaux in the south of France to Nantes in the west and Lille in the north and even into the Dutch Republic, where he met his wife.

In 1784 he became director of the theatre in Geneva, Switzerland, and then at the prestigious playhouse at Lyon in 1787. At the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789 he dropped everything and returned to Paris, where his lead actor&#x27;s voice, his writing skills, and his ability to organise and direct large-scale &quot;fêtes&quot; (civic feasts) were to make him famous.

==Activism==
Collot contributed to revolutionary agitation from the very beginning, but it was not until 1791 that he became a figure of importance. With the publication of &quot;&quot;, an almanac advocating a constitutional monarchy in popular terms, he suddenly acquired great popularity.

His fame was soon increased by his involvement on behalf of the Swiss of the Château-Vieux Regiment, condemned to the galleys for mutiny at Nancy. Collot d&#x27;Herbois&#x27; efforts resulted in their freedom, he went to Brest in search of them, and a civic feast was held on his behalf and theirs, which occasioned a poem by André de Chénier.

His opinions became more and more radical as the revolution progressed. Collot d&#x27;Herbois was a member of the Paris Commune during the insurrection of 10 August 1792 and was subsequently elected deputy for Paris to the National Convention. On the first day of the Convention, 21 September 1792, he was the first to demand the abolition of the French monarchy. Collot d&#x27;Herbois later voted for the death of Louis XVI (&quot;without delay&quot;).

==Terror, Thermidor, Deportation and Death==

After the insurrection of August 10 and the establishment of the National Convention, Collot d&#x27;Herbois became engaged in the struggle between the two main political parties, the Mountain and the Girondists. After François Hanriot&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 31 May 1793 and the ousting of the Girondins, he was conspicuous in his attack on the defeated party. Along with his close friend Jacques-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne, he sat at the extreme left of the Convention, attacking speculators and proposing egalitarian programmes. In June, he was made President of the Convention, and in September he was appointed with Billaud-Varenne to the Committee of Public Safety, where he was active as a sort of general secretary.

After having entrusted him with several missions to Nice, Nevers, and Compiègne, the Convention sent him, along with Joseph Fouché, on 30 October 1793, to punish the revolt of Lyon. There, he introduced the Reign of Terror in its most violent form, with mass executions, including more than a hundred priests and nuns, and began the dismantling of the city itself. His excessive behavior led the Committee of Public Safety to have Collot return to Paris as a suspect.

The month of May 1794 saw assassination attempts on Collot on the 23rd and fellow Committee member Maximilien Robespierre on the 25th. As Collot was accused of excessive slaughter and destruction, and suspected his own arrest and execution, he opposed Robespierre during the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794 while presiding over the Convention during the initial session. Despite this change of heart, Collot d&#x27;Herbois was accused of complicity with Robespierre, the two having previously been colleagues on the Committee of Public Safety, but was acquitted. Denounced a second time, he defended himself by pleading that he had acted for the Revolution, but, in March 1795, he was condemned with Bertrand Barère and Billaud-Varenne to transportation to Cayenne, French Guiana, where he exerted a brief revolutionary influence before dying of yellow fever in 1796.

== Works ==
Beginning his literary career in 1772 with the critically acclaimed &quot;Lucie, ou les Parents imprudents&quot; and finishing in 1792 with &quot;L&#x27;Aîné et le cadet&quot;, Collot was an accomplished, if minor, dramatist in a turbulent period of the French stage.

Before the Revolution, he wrote at least fifteen plays, of which ten survive, including &quot;Lucie&quot;, an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (titled, &quot;M. Rodomont, ou l&#x27;Amant loup-garou&quot;), and an adaptation of Pedro Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s &quot;El Alcalde de Zalamea&quot; (titled, &quot;Il y a bonne justice, ou le Paysan magistrat&quot;), all three of which kept the stage throughout France for over a decade. During the first three years of the Revolution he wrote at least seven more plays, of which six survive, juggling the tearful love themes of &quot;le drame bourgeois&quot; () with political themes and messages in such plays as &quot;L&#x27;Inconnu, ou le Préjugé vaincu&quot; () and &quot;Socrate&quot; (on Socrates).

In 1791, he wrote the prize-winning &quot;L&#x27;Almanach du père Gérard&quot; (), a fictional account of revolutionary morality which went on to become the best-seller of the period, establishing his political credentials in the process.

He was also one of the authors of the first French republican Constitution, which was written in 1793 but never applied.

<text>HTM Personenvervoer NV (HTM, from the former name Haagsche Tramweg Maatschappij) is a public transport company in the Netherlands operating trams, lightrail and buses in The Hague, Rijswijk, Leidschendam, Voorburg, Delft, Zoetermeer, Wateringen, Pijnacker and Nootdorp, the so-called Conurbation Haaglanden. The lightrail connection (called RandstadRail, RR) to Zoetermeer is operated in cooperation with RET, the Rotterdam-public transport company, which operates the connection between The Hague Central Station and Slinge in the south of Rotterdam, thus giving a fast and easy connection between the two city-centres.
Regional transports are serviced by Connexxion, Arriva and RET.

In September 2012 it was announced that Dutch Railways (NS) wanted to acquire a 49% stake in HTM. The initiative came from HTM and was received positively by the (then) sole shareholder in HTM, the municipality of The Hague. The House of Representatives was less positive, VVD parliament member Aukje de Vries, for example, felt that &quot;a state-owned company should not step further into a market where it has been agreed that the market must do its job.&quot; On 5 April 2013, the city council of The Hague approved the proposal, with NS paying €45 million for the shares.

Because on 15 October 2013 the NS took a 49% stake in HTM, and was 100% shareholder of Qbuzz, the HTMbuzz shares were once again fully owned by HTM. The NS remained co-owner of HTMbuzz, through HTM, for almost half of this shift in shares.

On 6 July 2016 it was announced that the municipality of The Hague wanted to buy back the shares of HTM from NS, which announced that it would continue to work together with the municipality and HTM on better traffic.

Since 7 December 2016, the HTM shares have been held by the municipality of The Hague again and MRDH has a share with special rights.

On this date, HTM also obtained the rail concession for public transport in the region of The Hague for the period from 2016 to 2026. On 17 May 2017, the Metropolitan Region of Rotterdam The Hague announced that it would give HTM the allocation of bus transport in the Hague region. On 8 December 2019, the bus concession officially takes effect and applies for the period 2019 - 2034.

From 9 December 2012 till 9 December 2018, citybus-services were, as mentioned, run by HTMbuzz, a joint-venture of HTM and Qbuzz, regional transports being serviced by Veolia, Arriva and RET. Fares on the network fall under the National Tariff System. Since 9 December 2018 HTMbuzz changed the name in HTM, as it used to be till 9 December 2012.

Since 2004 there is a tram tunnel with two underground tram stations (Spui and Grote Markt) in The Hague city centre; it is shared by tramline 6 and RR-lines 2, 3 and 4.

Trams &amp; LRVs:
* 600 volt DC-series: 70 GTL8-trams and 40 Avenio-trams;
* 600 &amp; 750 volt DC-series: 72 LRVs called RegioCitadis.

HTM once owned shares in SVD, the city bus company of Dordrecht. However, HTM has sold its shares because the ministry of transport and public works opposed the company competing for public transport concessions in tenders. In addition to this Arriva took over the service as of January 1, 2007, due to a better offer.

<doc id="245335" wikidata="Q3315360" url="?curid=245335" title="Found poetry">
<text>Found poetry is a type of poetry created by taking words, phrases, and sometimes whole passages from other sources and reframing them (a literary equivalent of a collage) by making changes in spacing and lines, or by adding or deleting text, thus imparting new meaning. The resulting poem can be defined as treated: changed in a profound and systematic manner; or untreated: virtually unchanged from the order, syntax and meaning of the poem.

==Concepts==

The concept of found poetry is closely connected to the revision of the concept of authorship, in the 20th century, (as John Hollander put it, &quot;anyone may &#x27;find&#x27; a text; the poet is he who names it, &#x27;Text). See Charles Reznikoff&#x27;s &quot;Testimony&quot;, whose source material was courtroom testimonies from the Gilded Age, and whose many iterations were aimed at debunking a national U.S. narrative that denied the country&#x27;s violent, discriminatory past. 

Types of common forms and practices of found poetry include free form excerpting and remixing, erasure, cento and cut-up.

== Comparisons and predecessors ==
Marquive Stenzel describes the Dadaism movement with its readymade philosophy as a predecessor for the practice that later became found poetry. Dadaists like Duchamp placed everyday practical objects in an environment that was aesthetic and in so doing called into question that object as art, the observer, the aesthetic environment and the definition of what art is.

Stylistically, found poetry is similar to the visual art of &quot;appropriation&quot; in which two- and three-dimensional art is created from recycled items, giving ordinary/commercial things new meaning when put within a new context in unexpected combinations or juxtapositions.

== Examples ==
An example of found poetry appeared in William Whewell&#x27;s &quot;An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
Hence no force, however great,
can stretch a cord, however fine,
into an horizontal line
which is accurately straight.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1972, Bern Porter published &quot;Found Poems&quot; via Something Else Press. It features hundreds of found poems selected from newspapers, ads and everyday printed matter, some involving collage techniques, others displayed as readymades. 

In 2003, &quot;Slate&quot; writer Hart Seely found poetry in the speeches and news briefings of Donald Rumsfeld. In a transcript of a Department of Defense news briefing from February 12, 2002, Rumsfeld ruminated on &quot;The Unknown&quot;: 
&lt;poem&gt;
As we know,
There are known knowns.
There are things we know we know.

We also know
There are known unknowns.
That is to say
We know there are some things
We do not know.

But there are also unknown unknowns,
The ones we don&#x27;t know
We don&#x27;t know.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Hart Seely published Rumsfeld&#x27;s poetry in the book, &quot;Pieces of Intelligence: The Existential Poetry of Donald H. Rumsfeld&quot; (2003). American composer Phil Kline set Rumsfeld&#x27;s lyrics to music in &quot;Rumsfeld&#x27;s Songs&quot;, a song cycle released on &quot;Zippo Songs&quot; (2004). Pianist Bryant Kong also used Rumsfeld&#x27;s lyrics on his release &quot;Poetry of Donald Rumsfeld&quot;.

In 2009, on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, the talk show host twice asked actor William Shatner to deliver the written words of former Alaskan Governor and Vice-Presidential nominee Sarah Palin in the style of beat poetry. Shatner performed Palin&#x27;s farewell speech on July 27, and several of her tweets on July 29. Shatner was supported by a bongo player and contrabassist.

Another well-known example of a public figure&#x27;s speech being converted into found poetry was the baseball play calls of Phil Rizzuto. Rizzuto was the announcer for the New York Yankees baseball team for some 40 years, and some of his at times rambling or disjointed commentary was collected and reformatted by Hart Seely and Tom Peyer into a collection of Rizzuto&#x27;s found poetry. An example is Rizzuto&#x27;s thoughts on the death of Yankees catcher Thurmon Munson in an airplane crash:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;

The Yankees have had a traumatic four days.
Actually five days.
That terrible crash with Thurman Munson.
To go through all that agony,
And then today,
You and I along with the rest of the team
Flew to Canton for the services,
And the family...
Very upset.

You know, it might,
It might sound a little corny.
But we have the most beautiful full moon tonight.
And the crowd,
Enjoying whatever is going on right now.
They say it might sound corny,
But to me it&#x27;s like some kind of a,
Like an omen.

Both the moon and Thurman Munson,
Both ascending up into heaven.
I just can&#x27;t get it out of my mind.
I just saw the full moon,
And it just reminded me of Thurman Munson,
And that&#x27;s it.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The website Verbatim Poetry has been publishing found poems weekly since March 2009. It emphasizes the poetry found in ordinary places, and employs traditional poetic forms such as the Shakespearean sonnet as well as free verse. As of November 2023, it is not accepting submissions.

The Internet&#x27;s first formal literary journal devoted to found poetry, &quot;The Found Poetry Review&quot;, debuted in 2011. The quarterly journal featured traditional centos and poems taken from textbooks, Marcel Duchamp paintings, Charles Manson&#x27;s trial testimony, AOL search data, Emily Post&#x27;s etiquette books, Wikipedia articles, Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, Wonder Woman comics and more. It is no longer on the web as of 2024.

&quot;Unlost Journal&quot; is a biannual online journal that publishes found poetry and collage and other visual art based on found sources. 

Comedian Dave Gorman frequently creates comical found poems using bizarre or humorous comments that people have left in the comment sections of online news websites on his Dave series &quot;Dave Gorman: Modern Life Is Goodish&quot;.

In a literary critic Galina Rymbu&#x27;s opinion, «Bot Conversation» of Yuri Rydkin is written in the genre of &quot;found poetry&quot;. His work are screenshots of artistic dialogue with virtual interlocutor.

<text>Galician-language literature is the literature written in Galician. The earliest works in Galician language are from the early 13th-century &quot;trovadorismo&quot; tradition. In the Middle Ages, &quot;Galego-português&quot; (Galician-Portuguese) was a language of culture, poetry (troubadours) and religion throughout not only Galicia and Portugal but also in the Castile-León region.

After the separation of Portuguese and Galician, Galician was considered provincial and was not widely used for literary or academic purposes. It was with the &quot;Rexurdimento&quot; (&quot;Rebirth&quot;), in the mid-19th century that Galician was used again in literature, and then in politics.

Much literature by Galician authors is written in Spanish, such as by Ignacio Ramonet or Gonzalo Torrente Ballester - though such writers tend to be excluded from discussion of Galician literature and counted as Spanish-language literature.

Rosalia Castro de Murguía&#x27;s &quot;Cantares Gallegos&quot; (1863; Galician Songs) was the first Galician-language book to be published in four centuries. Related to literature, &#x27;s 1989 &quot;Sempre Xonxa&quot; is regarded as the first Galician-language film. The intellectual group Xeración Nós, a name that alludes to the Irish Sinn Féin (&quot;We Ourselves&quot;) promoted Galician culture in the 1920s. Xeración Galaxia was established to translate modern texts that would link an independent Galician culture with the European context. The Galician translation of the Bible was begun in 1968 by Editorial SEPT and published in 1989.

<text>The Ostalbkreis is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the east of Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on the border to Bavaria. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Schwäbisch Hall, Ansbach, Donau-Ries, Heidenheim, Göppingen and Rems-Murr.

==History==
The district was created in 1973, when the District of Aalen merged with most of the former District of Schwäbisch Gmünd.

==Geography==
The district is located in the eastern part of the Swabian Alb (&quot;Schwäbische Alb&quot;), hence its name which translates to &quot;Eastern Alb District&quot;. Main rivers in the district are the Rems, the Jagst and the Kocher, all affluents of the Neckar.

==Politics==
Federally, the district is part of two electoral ridings: 270 (Backnang – Schwäbisch Gmünd) and 271 (Aalen – Heidenheim). For the 2009 Election, the numeral designation was changed to 269 and 270 respectively. Both ridings are held by the CDU: Norbert Barthle (Backnang – Schwäbisch Gmünd) and Roderich Kiesewetter (Aalen - Heidenheim).

At the State level, the district also is part of two electoral ridings: 25 (Schwäbisch Gmünd) and 26 (Aalen). The last election was held on March 26, 2006 and both ridings were won by the CDU: Dr. Stefan Scheffold (Schwäbisch Gmünd) and Winfried Mack (Aalen).

The District election was held on June 7, 2009. Election results.

==Partnerships==
Since 1992 the district has an official partnership with the Italian Province of Ravenna. Also since the 1990s it has a friendship with the Finnish Province of Oulu.

==Coat of arms==
The imperial eagle to the right represents the free imperial cities in the district, especially the city of Aalen. The lion on the left is the symbol of the Staufen family, who founded the city of Schwäbisch Gmünd. These two symbols were taken from the coats of arms of the two precursor districts. The crosier in the middle represents Ellwangen Abbey, which possessed many smaller areas scattered in the district.

<text>Emil Artin (; March 3, 1898 – December 20, 1962) was an Austrian mathematician of Armenian descent.

Artin was one of the leading mathematicians of the twentieth century. He is best known for his work on algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields.

Along with Emmy Noether, he is considered the founder of modern abstract algebra.

==Early life and education==

===Parents===
Emil Artin was born in Vienna to parents Emma Maria, née Laura (stage name Clarus), a soubrette on the operetta stages of Austria and Germany, and Emil Hadochadus Maria Artin, Austrian-born of mixed Austrian and Armenian descent. His Armenian last name was Artinian which was shortened to Artin. Several documents, including Emil&#x27;s birth certificate, list the father&#x27;s occupation as &quot;opera singer&quot; though others list it as &quot;art dealer.&quot; It seems at least plausible that he and Emma had met as colleagues in the theater. They were married in St. Stephen&#x27;s Parish on July 24, 1895.

===Early education===

Artin entered school in September 1904, presumably in Vienna. By then, his father was already suffering symptoms of advanced syphilis, among them increasing mental instability, and was eventually institutionalized at the recently established (and imperially sponsored) insane asylum at Mauer Öhling, 125 kilometers west of Vienna. It is notable that neither wife nor child contracted this highly infectious disease. Artin&#x27;s father died there July 20, 1906. Young Artin was eight.

On July 15, 1907, Artin&#x27;s mother remarried to Rudolf Hübner: a prosperous manufacturing entrepreneur from Reichenberg, Bohemia (now Liberec in the Czech Republic). Documentary evidence suggests that Emma had already been a resident in Reichenberg the previous year, and in deference to her new husband, she had abandoned her vocal career. Hübner deemed a life in the theater unseemly—unfit for the wife of a man of his position.

In September 1907, Artin entered the Volksschule in Horní Stropnice. For that year, he lived away from home, boarding on a local farm. The following year, he returned to the home of his mother and stepfather, and entered the Realschule in Reichenberg, where he pursued his secondary education until June 1916.

In Reichenberg, Artin formed a lifelong friendship with a young neighbor, Arthur Baer, who became an astronomer, teaching for many years at University of Cambridge. Astronomy was an interest the two boys shared already at this time. They each had telescopes. They also rigged a telegraph between their houses, over which once Baer excitedly reported to his friend an astronomical discovery he thought he had made—perhaps a supernova, he thought—and told Artin where in the sky to look. Artin tapped back the terse reply &quot;A-N-D-R-O-M-E-D-A N-E-B-E-L.&quot; (Andromeda nebula)

Artin&#x27;s academic performance in the first years at the Realschule was spotty. Up to the end of the 1911–1912 school year, for instance, his grade in mathematics was merely &quot;genügend,&quot; (satisfactory). Of his mathematical inclinations at this early period he later wrote, &quot;Meine eigene Vorliebe zur Mathematik zeigte sich erst im sechzehnten Lebensjahr, während vorher von irgendeiner Anlage dazu überhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte.&quot; (&quot;My own predilection for mathematics manifested itself only in my sixteenth year; before that, one could certainly not speak of any particular aptitude for it.&quot;) His grade in French for 1912 was actually &quot;nicht genügend&quot; (unsatisfactory). He did rather better work in physics and chemistry. But from 1910 to 1912, his grade for &quot;Comportment&quot; was &quot;nicht genügend.&quot;

Artin spent the school year 1912–1913 away from home, in France, a period he spoke of later as one of the happiest of his life. He lived that year with the family of Edmond Fritz, in the vicinity of Paris, and attended a school there. When he returned from France to Reichenberg, his academic work markedly improved, and he began consistently receiving grades of &quot;gut&quot; or &quot;sehr gut&quot; (good or very good) in virtually all subjects—including French and &quot;Comportment.&quot; By the time he completed studies at the Realschule in June 1916, he was awarded the Reifezeugnis (diploma—not to be confused with the Abitur) that affirmed him &quot;reif mit Auszeichnung&quot; (qualified with distinction) for graduation to a technical university.

===University education===
Now that it was time to move on to university studies, Artin was no doubt content to leave Reichenberg, for relations with his stepfather were clouded. According to him, Hübner reproached him &quot;day and night&quot; with being a financial burden, and even when Artin became a university lecturer and then a professor, Hübner deprecated his academic career as self-indulgent and belittled its paltry emolument.

In October 1916, Artin matriculated at the University of Vienna, having focused by now on mathematics. He studied there with Philipp Furtwängler, and also took courses in astrophysics and Latin.

Studies at Vienna were interrupted when Artin was drafted in June 1918 into the Austrian army (his Army photo ID is dated July 1, 1918). Assigned to the K.u. K. 44th Infantry Regiment, he was stationed northwest of Venice at Primolano, on the Italian front in the foothills of the Dolomites. To his great relief, Artin managed to avoid combat by volunteering for service as a translator—his ignorance of Italian notwithstanding. He did know French, of course, and some Latin, was generally a quick study, and was motivated by a highly rational fear in a theater of that war that had often proven a meat-grinder. In his scramble to learn at least some Italian, Artin had recourse to an encyclopedia, which he once consulted for help in dealing with the cockroaches that infested the Austrian barracks. At some length, the article described a variety of technical methods, concluding finally with—Artin laughingly recalled in later years—&quot;la caccia diretta&quot; (&quot;the direct hunt&quot;). Indeed, &quot;la caccia diretta&quot; was the straightforward method he and his fellow infantrymen adopted.

Artin survived both war and vermin on the Italian front, and returned late in 1918 to the University of Vienna, where he remained through Easter of the following year.

By June 1919, he had moved to Leipzig and matriculated at the university there as a &quot;Class 2 Auditor&quot; (&quot;Hörer zweiter Ordnung&quot;). Late the same year, Artin undertook the formality of standing for a qualifying examination by an academic board of the Oberrealschule in Leipzig, which he passed with the grade of &quot;gut&quot; (good), receiving for the second time the Reifezeugnis (diploma attesting the equivalence of satisfactory completion of 6 years at a Realschule). How this Leipzig Reifezeugnis differed technically from the one he had been granted at Reichenberg is unclear from the document, but it apparently qualified him for regular matriculation as a student at the university, which normally required the Abitur.

From 1919 to June 1921, Artin pursued mostly mathematical studies at Leipzig. His principal teacher and dissertation advisor was Gustav Herglotz. Additionally, Artin took courses in chemistry and various fields of physics, including mechanics, atomic theory, quantum theory, Maxwellian theory, radioactivity, and astrophysics. In June 1921 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree, based on his &quot;excellent&quot; dissertation, &quot;Quadratische Körper im Gebiete der höheren Kongruenzen&quot; (&quot;Quadratic Fields in the domain of higher congruences&quot;), and the oral examination which—his diploma affirms—he had passed three days earlier &quot;with extraordinary success.&quot;

In the fall of 1921, Artin moved to the University of Göttingen, considered the &quot;Mecca&quot; of mathematics at the time, where he pursued one year of post-doctoral studies in mathematics and mathematical physics with Richard Courant and David Hilbert. While at Göttingen, he worked closely with Emmy Noether and Helmut Hasse.

Aside from consistently good school grades in singing, the first documentary evidence of Artin&#x27;s deep and lifelong engagement with music comes from the year in Göttingen, where he was regularly invited to join in the chamber music sessions hosted by Richard Courant. He played all the keyboard instruments, and was an especially accomplished flautist, although it is not known exactly by what instruction he had achieved proficiency on these instruments. He became especially devoted to the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

==Career==
===Professorship at Hamburg===
Courant arranged for Artin to receive a stipend for the summer of 1922 in Göttingen, which occasioned his declining a position offered him at the University of Kiel. The following October, however, he accepted an equivalent position at Hamburg, where in 1923, he completed the Habilitation thesis (required of aspirants to a professorship in Germany), and on July 24 advanced to the rank of Privatdozent.

On April 1, 1925, Artin was promoted to Associate Professor (außerordentlicher Professor). In this year also, Artin applied for and was granted German citizenship. He was promoted to full Professor (ordentlicher Professor) on October 15, 1926.

Early in the summer of 1925, Artin attended the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near Kassel with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through Iceland later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during World War II) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure. Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to Norway, where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, Húsavík in the north of the island. Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Laxá River to Lake Mývatn. They made a circuit of the large, irregular lake, staying in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well.

Artin kept a meticulous journal of this trip, making daily entries in a neat, minuscule hand. He and several of the young men had brought cameras, so that the trek is documented also by nearly 200 photographs. Artin&#x27;s journal attests to his overarching interest in the geology of this mid-Atlantic island, situated over the boundary of two tectonic plates whose shifting relation makes it geologically hyperactive.

In keeping with the Wandervogel ethos, Artin and his companions carried music with them wherever they visited. The young men had packed guitars and violins, and Artin played the harmoniums common in the isolated farmsteads where they found lodging. The group regularly entertained their Icelandic hosts, not in full exchange for board and lodging, to be sure, but for goodwill certainly, and sometimes for a little extra on their plates, or a modestly discounted tariff.

From Lake Mývatn, Artin and his companions headed west towards Akureyri, passing the large waterfall Goðafoss on the way. From Akureyri, they trekked west down the Öxnadalur (Ox Valley) intending to rent pack horses and cross the high and barren interior by foot to Reykjavík. By the time they reached the lower end of Skagafjörður, however, they were persuaded by a local farmer from whom they had hoped to rent the horses that a cross-country trek was by then impracticable; with the approach of winter, highland routes were already snow-bound and impassable. Instead of turning south, then, they turned north to Siglufjörður, where they boarded another steamer that took them around the western peninsula and down the coast to Reykjavík. From Reykjavík, they returned via Norway to Hamburg. By Artin&#x27;s calculation the distance they had covered on foot through Iceland totaled 450 kilometers.

Early in 1926, the University of Münster offered Artin a professorial position; however, Hamburg matched the offer financially, and (as noted above) promoted him to full professor, making him (along with his young colleague Helmut Hasse) one of the two youngest professors of mathematics in Germany.

It was in this period that he acquired his lifelong nickname, &quot;Ma,&quot; short for mathematics, which he came to prefer to his given name, and which virtually everyone who knew him well used. Although the nickname might seem to imply a narrow intellectual focus, quite the reverse was true of Artin. Even his teaching at the University of Hamburg went beyond the strict boundaries of mathematics to include mechanics and relativity theory. He kept up on a serious level with advances in astronomy, chemistry and biology (he owned and used a fine microscope), and the circle of his friends in Hamburg attests to the catholicity of his interests. It included the painter Heinrich Stegemann, and the author and organ-builder Hans Henny Jahnn. Stegemann was a particularly close friend, and made portraits of Artin, his wife Natascha, and their two Hamburg-born children. Music continued to play a central role in his life; he acquired a Neupert double manual harpsichord, and a clavichord made by the Hamburg builder Walther Ebeloe, as well as a silver flute made in Hamburg by G. Urban. Chamber music gatherings became a regular event at the Artin apartment as they had been at the Courants in Göttingen.

On August 15, 1929, Artin married Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha), a young Russian émigré who had been a student in several of his classes. One of their shared interests was photography, and when Artin bought a Leica for their joint use (a Leica A, the first commercial model of this legendary camera), Natascha began chronicling the life of the family, as well as the city of Hamburg. For the next decade, she made a series of artful and expressive portraits of Artin that remain by far the best images of him taken at any age. Artin, in turn, took many fine and evocative portraits of Natascha. Lacking access to a professional darkroom, their films and prints had to be developed in a makeshift darkroom set up each time (and then dismantled again) in the small bathroom of whatever apartment they were occupying. The makeshift darkroom notwithstanding, the high artistic level of the resulting photographic prints is attested to by the exhibit of Natascha&#x27;s photographs mounted in 2001 by the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, and its accompanying catalogue, &quot;Hamburg—Wie Ich Es Sah.&quot;

In 1930, Artin was offered a professorship at ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) in Zürich, to replace Hermann Weyl, who had moved to Göttingen. He chose to remain at Hamburg, however. Two years later, in 1932, for contributions leading to the advancement of mathematics, Artin was honored—jointly with Emmy Noether—with the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award, which carried a grant of 500 marks.

===Nazi period===

In January 1933, Natascha gave birth to their first child, Karin. A year and a half later, in the summer of 1934, son Michael was born. The political climate at Hamburg was not so poisonous as that at Göttingen, where by 1935 the mathematics department had been purged of Jewish and dissident professors. Still, Artin&#x27;s situation became increasingly precarious, not only because Natascha was of Jewish descent, but also because Artin made no secret of his distaste for the Hitler regime (he evidently signed the 1933 Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State, though he said his name had been added without his knowledge). At one point, Wilhelm Blaschke, by then a Nazi Party member, but nonetheless solicitous of the Artins’ well-being, warned Artin discreetly to close his classroom door so his frankly anti-Nazi comments could not be heard by passersby in the hallway.

Natascha recalled going down to the newsstand on the corner one day and being warned in hushed tones by the man from whom she and Artin bought their paper that a man had daily been watching their apartment from across the street. Once tipped off, she and Artin became very aware of the watcher (Natascha liked to refer to him as their &quot;spy&quot;), and even rather enjoyed the idea of his being forced to follow them on the long walks they loved taking in the afternoons to a café far out in the countryside.

Toying with their watcher on a fine autumn afternoon was one thing, but the atmosphere was in fact growing inexorably serious. Natascha&#x27;s Jewish father and her sister, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had already left for the U.S. in the summer of 1933. Of Jewish descent, Natascha&#x27;s status was, if not ultimately quite hopeless, certainly not good. Hasse, like Blaschke a nationalistic supporter of the regime, had applied for Party membership, but was nonetheless no anti-Semite. Besides he was a long-time friend and colleague of Artin&#x27;s. He suggested that the two Artin children—in Nazi terminology, &quot;Mischlinge zweiten Grades&quot;—might, if a few strategic strings could be pulled, be officially &quot;aryanized.&quot; Hasse offered to exert his influence with the Ministry of Education (Kultur- und Schulbehörde, Hochschulwesen), and Artin—not daring to leave any stone unturned, especially with respect to the safety of his children—went along with this effort. He asked his father-in-law, by then resident in Washington D.C., to draft and have notarized an affidavit attesting to the Christian lineage of his late wife, Natascha&#x27;s mother. Artin submitted this affidavit to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail.

By this time, to be precise, on July 15, 1937, because of Natascha&#x27;s status as &quot;Mischling ersten Grades,&quot; Artin had lost his post at the university—technically, compelled into early retirement—on the grounds of paragraph 6 of the Act to Restore the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums) of April 7, 1933. Ironically, he had applied only some months earlier, on February 8, 1937, for a leave of absence from the university in order to accept a position offered him at Stanford. On March 15, 1937, the response had come back denying his application for leave on the grounds that his services to the university were indispensable (&quot;Da die Tätigkeit des Professors Dr. Artin an der Universität Hamburg nicht entbehrt werden kann. . .&quot;).

By July, when he was summarily &quot;retired,&quot; (&quot;in Ruhestand versetzt&quot;) the position at Stanford University had been filled. However, through the efforts of Richard Courant (by then at New York University), and Solomon Lefschetz at Princeton University, a position was found for him at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.

===Emigration to the U.S.===
The family must have worked feverishly to prepare for emigration to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment. Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of money out of the country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double-manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and potato masher to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment.

On the morning they were to board the Hamburg-Amerika line ship in Bremerhaven, October 21, 1937, daughter Karin woke with a high temperature. Terrified that should this opportunity be missed, the window of escape from Nazi Germany might close forever, Artin and Natascha chose to risk somehow getting Karin past emigration and customs officials without their noticing her condition. They managed to conceal Karin&#x27;s feverish state, and without incident boarded the ship. When they landed a week later at Hoboken, New Jersey, Richard Courant and Natascha&#x27;s father, the Russian agronomist Naum Jasny (then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were on the dock to welcome the family to the United States.

===Bloomington years===

It was early November 1937 by the time they arrived in South Bend, where Artin joined the faculty at Notre Dame, and taught for the rest of that academic year. He was offered a permanent position the following year 170 miles to the south at Indiana University, in Bloomington. Shortly after the family resettled there, a second son, Thomas, was born on November 12, 1938.

After moving to Bloomington, Artin quickly acquired a piano, and soon after that a Hammond Organ, a recently invented electronic instrument that simulated the sound of a pipe organ. He wanted this instrument in order primarily to play the works of J. S. Bach, and because the pedal set that came with the production model had a range of only two octaves (not quite wide enough for all the Bach pieces), he set about extending its range. Music was a constant presence in the Artin household. Karin played the cello, and then the piano as well, and Michael played the violin. As in Hamburg, the Artin living room was regularly the venue for amateur chamber music performances.

The circle of the Artins’ University friends reflected Artin&#x27;s wide cultural and intellectual interests. Notable among them were Alfred Kinsey and his wife of the Psychology Department, as well as prominent members of the Fine Arts, Art History, Anthropology, German Literature, and Music Departments. For several summer semesters, Artin accepted teaching positions at other universities, viz., Stanford in 1939 and 1940, The University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1941 and 1951, and The University of Colorado, in Boulder, in 1953. On each of these occasions, the family accompanied him.

Artin insisted that only German be spoken in the house. Even Tom, born in the U.S., spoke German as his first language, acquiring English only from his siblings and his playmates in the neighborhood; for the first four or five years of his life, he spoke English with a pronounced German accent. Consistent with his program of maintaining the family&#x27;s German cultural heritage, Artin gave high priority to regularly reading German literature aloud to the children. The text was frequently from Goethe&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit&quot;, or his poems, &quot;Erlkönig,&quot; for instance. Occasionally, he would read from an English text. Favorites were Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, Charles Dickens’s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, and Oscar Wilde’s &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;. For the Artin children, these readings replaced radio entertainment, which was strictly banned from the house. There was a radio, but (with the notable exception of Sunday morning broadcasts by E. Power Biggs from the organ at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, to which Artin and Natascha listened still lounging in bed) it was switched on only to hear news of the war. Similarly, the Artin household would never in years to come harbor a television set. Once the war had ended, the radio was retired to the rear of a dark closet.

As German citizens, Artin and Natascha were technically classified as enemy aliens for the duration of the war. On April 12, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe only weeks away, they applied for naturalization as American citizens. American citizenship was granted them on February 7, 1946.

On the orders of a Hamburg doctor whom he had consulted about a chronic cough, Artin had given up smoking years before. He had vowed not to smoke so long as Adolf Hitler remained in power. On May 8, 1945, at the news of Germany&#x27;s surrender and the fall of the Third Reich, Natascha made the mistake of reminding him of this vow, and in lieu of a champagne toast, he indulged in what was intended to be the smoking of a single, celebratory cigarette. Unfortunately, the single cigarette led to a second, and another after that. Artin returned to heavy smoking for the rest of his life.

===Princeton years===
If Göttingen had been the &quot;Mecca&quot; of mathematics in the 1920s and early 1930s, Princeton, following the decimation of German mathematics under the Nazis, had become the center of the mathematical world in the 1940s. In April 1946, Artin was appointed Professor at Princeton, at a yearly salary of $8,000. The family moved there in the fall of 1946.

Notable among his graduate students at Princeton are Serge Lang, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, and O. Timothy O&#x27;Meara. Emil chose also to teach the honors section of Freshman calculus each year. He was renowned for the elegance of his teaching. Frei and Roquette write that Artin&#x27;s &quot;main medium of communication was teaching and conversation: in groups, seminars and in smaller circles. We have many statements of people near to him describing his unpretentious way of communicating with everybody, demanding quick grasp of the essentials but never tired of explaining the necessary. He was open to all kinds of suggestions, and distributed joyfully what he knew. He liked to teach, also to young students, and his excellent lectures, always well prepared but without written notes, were hailed for their clarity and beauty.&quot;

Whenever he was asked whether mathematics was a science, Artin would reply unhesitatingly, &quot;No. An art.&quot; His explanation was that: &quot;[Mathematicians] all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners. In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements. Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous. We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realizing that we have enabled our listeners to see at a glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.&quot;

During the Princeton years, Artin built a reflecting telescope to plans he found in the magazine &quot;Sky and Telescope&quot;, which he subscribed to. He spent weeks in the basement attempting to grind the mirror to specifications, without success, and his continued failure to get it right led to increasing frustration. Then, in California to give a talk, he made a side trip to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he discussed his project with the astronomers. Whether it was their technical advice, or Natascha&#x27;s intuitive suggestion that it might be too cold in the basement, and that he should try the procedure upstairs in the warmth of his study (which he did), he completed the grinding of the mirror in a matter of days. With this telescope, he surveyed the night skies over Princeton.

In September 1955, Artin accepted an invitation to visit Japan. From his letters, it is clear he was treated like royalty by the Japanese mathematical community, and was charmed by the country. He was interested in learning about the diverse threads of Buddhism, and visiting its holy sites. In a letter home he describes his visit to the temples at Nara. &quot;Then we were driven to a place nearby, Horiuji where a very beautiful Buddhist temple is. We were received by the abbot, and a priest translated into English. We obtained the first sensible explanation about modern Buddhism. The difficulty of obtaining such an explanation is enormous. To begin with most Japanese do not know and do not understand our questions. All this is made more complicated by the fact that there are numerous sects and each one has another theory. Since you get your information only piece wise, you cannot put it together. This results in an absurd picture. I am talking of the present day, not of its original form.&quot;

His letter goes on to outline at length the general eschatological framework of Buddhist belief. Then he adds, &quot;By the way, a problem given by the Zens for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?&quot;

==Return to Hamburg and personal life==
The following year, Artin took a leave of absence to return to Germany for the first time since emigration, nearly twenty years earlier. He spent the fall semester at Göttingen, and the next at Hamburg. For the Christmas holidays, he travelled to his birthplace, Vienna, to visit his mother, Vienna being a city he had not seen in decades. In a letter home he described the experience of his return in a single, oddly laconic sentence: &quot;It is kind of amusing to walk through Vienna again.&quot; In 1957, an honorary doctorate was conferred on Artin by the University of Freiburg. That fall, he returned to Princeton for what would be his final academic year at that institution. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957.

Artin&#x27;s marriage to Natascha had by this time seriously frayed. Though nominally still husband and wife, resident in the same house, they were for all intents and purposes living separate lives. Artin was offered a professorship at Hamburg, and at the conclusion of Princeton&#x27;s spring semester, 1958, he moved permanently to Germany. His decision to leave Princeton University and the United States was complicated, based on multiple factors, prominent among them Princeton&#x27;s (then operative) mandatory retirement age of 65. Artin had no wish to retire from teaching and direct involvement with students. Hamburg&#x27;s offer was open-ended.

Artin and Natascha were divorced in 1959. In Hamburg, Artin had taken an apartment, but soon gave it over to his mother whom he had brought from Vienna to live near him in Hamburg. He in turn moved into the apartment of the mathematician Hel Braun in the same neighborhood; though they never married, their relationship was equivalent to marriage. On January 4, 1961, he was granted German citizenship. In June 1962, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of Blaise Pascal, the University of Clermont-Ferrand conferred an honorary doctorate on him. On December 20 of the same year, Artin died at home in Hamburg, aged 64, of a heart attack.

The University of Hamburg honored his memory on April 26, 2005, by naming one of its newly renovated lecture halls The Emil Artin Lecture Hall.

==Influence and work==
Artin was one of the leading algebraists of the century, with an influence larger than might be guessed from the one volume of his &quot;Collected Papers&quot; edited by Serge Lang and John Tate. He worked in algebraic number theory, contributing largely to class field theory and a new construction of L-functions. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields. The influential treatment of abstract algebra by van der Waerden is said to derive in part from Artin&#x27;s ideas, as well as those of Emmy Noether. Artin solved Hilbert&#x27;s seventeenth problem in 1927. He also developed the theory of braids as a branch of algebraic topology.

In 1955 Artin was teaching foundations of geometry at New York University. He used his notes to publish &quot;Geometric Algebra&quot; in 1957, where he extended the material to include symplectic geometry.

Artin was also an important expositor of Galois theory, and of the group cohomology approach to class ring theory (with John Tate), to mention two theories where his formulations became standard.

==Conjectures==

He left two conjectures, both known as Artin&#x27;s conjecture. The first concerns Artin L-functions for a linear representation of a Galois group; and the second the frequency with which a given integer &quot;a&quot; is a primitive root modulo primes &quot;p&quot;, when &quot;a&quot; is fixed and &quot;p&quot; varies. These are unproven; in 1967, Hooley published a conditional proof for the second conjecture, assuming certain cases of the generalized Riemann hypothesis.

==Supervision of research==
Artin advised over thirty doctoral students, including Bernard Dwork, Serge Lang, K. G. Ramanathan, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, Hans Zassenhaus and Max Zorn. A more complete list of his students can be found at the Mathematics Genealogy Project website (see &quot;External links,&quot; below).

==Family==
In 1932 he married Natascha Jasny, born in Russia to mixed parentage (her mother was Christian, her father, Jewish). Artin was not himself Jewish, but, on account of his wife&#x27;s racial status in Nazi Germany, was dismissed from his university position in 1937. They had three children, one of whom is Michael Artin, an American algebraic geometer and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His daughter, Karin Artin, was the first wife of John Tate.

<text>Norman George Painting (23 April 1924 – 29 October 2009) was an English actor, broadcaster and writer. He played Phil Archer in the BBC Radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; from the pilot episodes aired on the BBC Midlands Home Service in summer 1950, after the series went national on the Light Programme on 1 January 1951, until his death in 2009, when he was the longest-serving member of the cast. His last episode, recorded two days before he died, was broadcast on 22 November 2009. The character lived on until Phil was &quot;found dead&quot; in his armchair in February 2010. According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, Painting held the world record for an actor playing a continuous role, a total of 59 years, which has now been surpassed by co-actor Lesley Saweard and co-star Patricia Greene.

==Early life==
Painting was born in Leamington Spa, the son of a railway signalman. He was educated at Leamington College and King Edward VI School, Nuneaton, but left school aged 15 to work in a library. He was found to be medically unfit for military service in the Second World War, and studied English at the University of Birmingham instead, graduating with a first-class degree. He did post-graduate research at Christ Church, Oxford, and then became a tutor in Anglo-Saxon at Exeter College, Oxford.

==Radio career==
He began to appear on BBC radio while at the University of Birmingham, and continued while also performing as an actor with Oxford University Dramatic Society. He left Oxford University in 1949 to work for the BBC in Birmingham.

Painting had worked as a performer, interviewer, writer and producer for the BBC before he first appeared as Philip in &quot;The Archers&quot; in 1950. He became a script writer for the series in 1966, following in the footsteps of Edward J. Mason, Geoffrey Webb, David Turner and John Keir Cross. He wrote in his memoir of the programme, &quot;Forever Ambridge&quot; (named after Ambridge, the fictional West Midlands village in which the programme is set), that he believed that Geoffrey Webb, who had died some time before, was guiding his hand as he wrote. He wrote about 1,200 episodes under the pseudonym Bruno Milna. Artistic disagreements with a then editor, plus a general disillusionment with the BBC management, led him to retire from writing scripts in 1982 and to stick to just performing them.

The character of Phil Archer developed from the lusty young romantic lead of the early episodes, working on the neighbouring Fairbrother estate, into a father and grandfather, replacing Dan Archer as the patriarch of Brookfield Farm and a senior figure in the series. Perhaps his most famous moment occurred on 22 September 1955, when his wife, Grace Archer (née Fairbrother), was killed while trying to rescue a horse, Midnight, from a burning barn – the episode being transmitted on first day of ITV broadcasts. The character survived Painting by four months, dying peacefully in February 2010.

==Awards and honours==

He was appointed OBE in 1976, for services to broadcasting. He published two books on the Archers entitled &quot;Forever Ambridge&quot; (1975 and 1980, for the programme&#x27;s 25th and 30th anniversaries), and a personal memoir, &quot;Reluctant Archer&quot; (1982). He was the subject of a programme in the TV series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1991. On 12 September 2008, along with &quot;The Archers&quot;, Painting was inducted into the Birmingham Walk of Stars, becoming the sixth person to do so.

==Later life==
Painting suffered from poor health in later life, with several heart attacks in 1982 and later pancreatitis, a retinal detachment, and prostate surgery. In 2000, he stated he was suffering from bladder cancer.

He remained a bachelor, and lived alone at Warmington in Warwickshire. His body was found in his home in October 2009, shortly after he had died from heart failure. His ashes were scattered at Painting&#x27;s Plantation in Leamington Spa, with a memorial service at St Martin-in-the-Fields in May 2010.

He left his recordings, scripts, books, papers and letters to the University of Birmingham, and they are currently held at the Cadbury Research Library.

<text>Blackpool Football Club is a professional association football club based in the seaside resort of Blackpool, Lancashire, England. The team competes in EFL League One, the third tier of the English football league system.

Founded in 1887, the club formerly played its home games at Raikes Hall and the Athletic Grounds before moving to Bloomfield Road in 1901. Blackpool were founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889 and were invited into the Football League Second Division in 1896. They failed re-election in 1899 but had their Football League membership reinstated the following year. From 1923 onwards, Blackpool have worn the tangerine shade of orange shirts, traditionally accompanied by white shorts and tangerine socks.

Blackpool remained in the Second Division until they won the league title in 1929–30, though they were relegated after three seasons in the First Division. Promoted again in 1936–37, the club entered a golden period under the stewardship of long-time manager Joe Smith. Blackpool lost the 1948 and 1951 FA Cup finals before winning the competition in 1953, the so-called &quot;Matthews final&quot;, in which they beat Bolton Wanderers 4–3, overturning a 3–1 deficit in the closing stages of the game. That same year, four Blackpool players were in the England team which lost against Hungary at Wembley. In the 1950s they had four top-six finishes in the First Division, with their best position being runners-up to Manchester United in 1955–56. In 1956, Stanley Matthews was the inaugural recipient of the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Blackpool were relegated from the First Division in 1967, and again in 1971 after winning promotion in 1969–70. They dropped into the fourth tier after suffering relegations in 1978 and 1981, then gained promotion in 1984–85. They won the 1971 Anglo-Italian Cup final, and remain the only Lancashire club to have won a European trophy.

Between 1987 and 2019, the club was owned by the Oyston family. In 1996, Owen Oyston was jailed for the rape and indecent assault of a 16-year-old girl four years earlier. His wife, Vicki, took over the chairmanship of the club during her husband&#x27;s three-year prison term. The couple&#x27;s son, Karl, took over in 1999 and remained in the role for nineteen years. In 2018, after the Oyston family was found, in a High Court judgement, to have operated an &quot;illegitimate stripping&quot; of the club, paying out £26.77 million to companies they owned, Owen relieved Karl of his role and gave it to his daughter, Natalie. In June 2019, Simon Sadler, a 49-year-old Blackpool-born businessman, bought a 96.2% share in the club, completely removing the Oyston family from any involvement.

During the long years of Oyston ownership, Blackpool were relegated to the fourth tier in 1990, promoted via the play-offs in 1992, then relegated again in 2000. Blackpool reached the Premier League in 2010, after becoming the first club to gain promotion from every division of the Football League via the play-off system; they won the 2001 Third Division play-offs, 2007 League One play-offs and the 2010 Championship play-offs. They spent one season in the Premier League, under manager Ian Holloway, and later suffered a double relegation into League Two by 2016, though gained immediate promotion by winning the 2017 League Two play-off final, their sixth success in the format in eight finals.

==History==


===Formation and early years (1877–1900)===
Football had developed in Blackpool by 1877, when Victoria F.C. were founded as a church club with a ground in Caunce Street. This team disbanded a few years later but some of its members are understood to have merged with old boys from St John&#x27;s School to form a new club called Blackpool St John&#x27;s. The two factions remained disunited, however, and on 26 July 1887, at a meeting in the Stanley Arms public house, the members resolved to wind up St John&#x27;s and form a new club to represent the whole town. It was named Blackpool Football Club.

The new club managed to win two pieces of silverware in its first season in existence, 1887–88: the Fylde Cup and the Lancashire Junior Cup.

At the conclusion of the following 1888–89 season, Blackpool became founder members of the Lancashire League. In their first season in the competition, the club finished fifth out of the 13 member clubs. They finished as runners-up over the following three seasons (to Bury twice and Liverpool once), before winning the championship themselves on their fourth attempt.

Blackpool&#x27;s home at that point in time was Raikes Hall (also known as the Royal Palace Gardens), which was part of a large entertainment complex that included a theatre and a boating lake, amongst other attractions. This meant that the club&#x27;s average attendances were around the 2,000 mark, making the club&#x27;s formative years a financial success.

After struggling to repeat the success of the 1893–94 season, the Blackpool board decided it was time to leave local football behind, so on 13 May 1896 the club became a limited company and applied for entry to the Football League.

Their application was successful, and for the club&#x27;s debut season, 1896–97, they joined the 16-team Second Division. Blackpool&#x27;s first-ever Football League game took place on 5 September 1896, at Lincoln City, which they lost 3–1 in front of around 1,500 spectators.

For the 1897–98 campaign, the club played their home games at the Athletic Grounds (at the present-day Stanley Park). They remained there for the first seven home games of 1898–99, before returning to Raikes Hall for the remaining 10.

After finishing third-bottom, the club were not re-elected at the end of the 1898–99 season, and spent the 1899–1900 term back in the Lancashire League. They finished third, and after the Football League&#x27;s annual meeting, on 25 May 1900, were permitted back into Division Two. It was during this season out of the League that Blackpool amalgamated with local rivals South Shore and moved to Bloomfield Road.

===Early 20th century (1900–1946)===
During the 10 seasons that followed, Blackpool could finish no higher than 12th place. The club&#x27;s top goalscorers in the league included Bob Birket (10 goals in 1900–01), Geordie Anderson (12 goals in 1901–02) and Bob Whittingham (13 in 1908–09).

At the end of 1910–11, the club found themselves in seventh place, thanks largely to Joe Clennell&#x27;s haul of 18 goals.

It was a case of &quot;as you were&quot;, however, for the four seasons leading up to the First World War, with finishing positions of 14th, 20th, 16th and 10th. For the last of those seasons, Joe Lane netted 28 goals.

The outbreak of war forced the cancellation of League football for four years, during which time regional competitions were introduced. When normality resumed, in 1919–20, Blackpool had appointed their first full-time manager in the form of Bill Norman. Norman guided the club to fourth-placed finishes in his first two league seasons in charge (he was installed as manager during the final inter-war season), with Lane again netting close to 30 goals in the former.

The club&#x27;s form nosedived in the 1921–22 season, with a finishing position of 19th, before bouncing back to a fifth-placed finish the following campaign. Harry Bedford, who had joined the club from Nottingham Forest, was the country&#x27;s top league scorer, with 32 goals to his name.

Bedford repeated the feat the following season, this time under the watchful eye of new manager Frank Buckley, who replaced Bill Norman after his four years of service. Blackpool finished fourth in Buckley&#x27;s first season in charge.

The 1924–25 season was not as successful; a 17th-placed finish tempered only slightly by the club&#x27;s reaching the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time. A single-goal defeat at fellow Lancastrians Blackburn Rovers ended &quot;the Seasiders&quot;&#x27; run.

Buckley guided Blackpool to top-10 finishes in his final two seasons as manager – with Billy Tremelling&#x27;s 30 goals in the latter helping considerably – before he left to take the helm at Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Buckley&#x27;s replacement was Sydney Beaumont, who took charge for the 1927–28 season, but he lasted only until the spring after the club finished in 19th position.

Harry Evans was installed as the new Blackpool manager, in an honorary capacity, for the 1928–29 campaign. Due in no small part to Jimmy Hampson&#x27;s 40 goals, the club finished eighth. In his second season, Evans guided Blackpool to the Division Two championship (their only championship to date), finishing ahead of promotion rivals Chelsea and Oldham Athletic by three and four points respectively. Hampson had bagged 45 of the club&#x27;s 98 league goals.

Blackpool lasted only three seasons in the First Division. Two third-bottom finishes were followed by a last-placed finish, and the club returned to the Second Division.

The club&#x27;s relegation prompted the Blackpool board to install a recognised manager, and they opted for Sandy MacFarlane. MacFarlane occupied the Bloomfield Road hot seat for just two seasons, in which the club finished 11th and fourth. MacFarlane&#x27;s final season, 1934–35, marked Jimmy Hampson&#x27;s eighth successive (and final) season as Blackpool&#x27;s top League goalscorer.

Joe Smith was appointed Blackpool&#x27;s sixth manager in August 1935, a role in which he remained for the next 23 years.

The club finished 10th in Smith&#x27;s first season, with Bobby Finan taking over from Hampson as top scorer, with 34 goals. It was Smith&#x27;s second season in charge, however, that marked the starting point of the success to come. Blackpool finished the 1936–37 season as runners-up in the Second Division to Leicester City and were promoted back to the First Division.

Two seasons of Division One football were played before the Second World War intervened. Blackpool sat atop the table at the time the abandonment occurred. Regional competitions were implemented again between 1939 and 1945. For the 1945–46 season, after the war&#x27;s conclusion, Blackpool spent one season in the Football League North.

===Post-Second World War (1946–1967)===
Scottish defender Hugh Kelly had arrived at Blackpool in 1943, as had fellow defender Tommy Garrett in 1942. Forward Stan Mortensen joined the club after the war in 1946. Mortensen went on to become Blackpool&#x27;s top League goalscorer for the next nine seasons, sharing the honour with Allan Brown in 1952–53. Stanley Matthews, who became a regular source of goals for Mortensen, joined Blackpool in 1947, as did centre-forward Jackie Mudie. Goalkeeper George Farm signed in 1948, followed by outside-left Bill Perry in 1949. Kelly, Garrett, Matthews, Mudie, Farm and Perry would play with the club throughout the 1950s, the most successful decade in the club&#x27;s history.

Post-war Blackpool reached the FA Cup final on three occasions, losing to Manchester United in 1948 and Newcastle United three years later, and winning it in 1953, captained by Harry Johnston.

For the first and only time in the club&#x27;s history, four Blackpool players (Johnston, Matthews, Mortensen and debutant Ernie Taylor) represented England in the infamous 6–3 defeat by Hungary at Wembley on 25 November 1953. Of the four, only Matthews would ever represent his country again.

In 1955–56, and now captained by Kelly, Blackpool attained their highest-ever finish in the Football League: runners-up to Manchester United, despite losing their final four league games. It was a feat that could not be matched or bettered over the following two seasons, with fourth and seventh-placed finishes, and Smith left Blackpool as the club&#x27;s most successful and longest-serving manager.

Smith was succeeded, in May 1958, by Ron Suart, the first former &quot;Tangerine&quot; to return to the club as manager. In his first season, he led the club to eighth in the First Division and the sixth round of the FA Cup. A 23-year-old Ray Charnley topped the club&#x27;s goalscoring chart with 20, in his first season as a professional, and went on to repeat the feat for seven of the eight seasons that followed.

The League Cup came into existence in 1960–61. Blackpool were knocked out in the second round, the round in which they entered. The club&#x27;s First Division status came under threat, but they managed to avoid relegation by one point, at the expense of Newcastle United. Local arch-rivals Preston North End were the other club to make the drop.

In October 1961, Matthews, now aged 46, was sold back to Stoke City. Mid-table finishes in 1961–62 and 1962–63 (and an appearance in the League Cup semi-finals during the former) were offset by another lowly finish of 18th in 1963–64, with Alan Ball top-scoring with 13 goals. Much of the same ensued over the following two seasons, before relegation finally occurred in 1966–67. Blackpool finished bottom of the table, eight points adrift of fellow demotion victims Aston Villa. Suart had resigned four months before the end of the season. His replacement was another former Blackpool player, Stan Mortensen.

===Late 20th century (1967–2000)===
Mortensen picked up the pieces for the club&#x27;s first season back in the Second Division in 30 years, guiding them to a third-placed finish. They had gone into the final game of the season at Huddersfield Town knowing that a win would likely secure a return to the First Division. They won 3–1, but once the premature celebrations had ended, they discovered that their nearest rivals, Queens Park Rangers, had scored a last-minute winner at Aston Villa. Q.P.R. were promoted by virtue of a better goal-average: 1.86, to Blackpool&#x27;s 1.65.

At the end of the following 1968–69 campaign, the Blackpool board made the decision to sack Mortensen after just over two years in the job. Their decision was met by fans with shock and anger, as Mortensen was as popular a manager as he was a player.

Les Shannon, who spent the majority of his playing career with Blackpool&#x27;s Lancashire rivals Burnley, was installed as manager for the 1969–70 season. In his first season, he succeeded where Mortensen had failed, by guiding the club back to the top flight as runners-up behind Huddersfield Town. Their promotion had been sealed after the penultimate game of the season, a 3–0 victory at rivals Preston North End, courtesy of a Fred Pickering hat-trick. The result effectively relegated the hosts to the Third Division.

As quickly as Shannon had taken Blackpool up, he saw them return whence they came. The club finished at the foot of the table and were relegated back to Division Two, along with Burnley. Before the season&#x27;s conclusion, Shannon was briefly replaced by Jimmy Meadows as caretaker manager, who in turn was permanently replaced by Bob Stokoe. On 12 June 1971, well over a month after the conclusion of the League season, Blackpool won the Anglo-Italian Cup with a 2–1 victory over Bologna in the final. This was achieved without the services of Jimmy Armfield, who retired in May after 17 years and 627 appearances for the club.

Blackpool finished amongst the top 10 teams in the Second Division for six consecutive seasons, under three different managers: Stokoe, Harry Potts and Allan Brown. Twice Blackpool narrowly missed promotion to Division One, by two points in 1974 and 1977.

In February 1978, midway through 1977–78, Brown&#x27;s second season at the helm, Blackpool were seventh in the division. Having just beaten local rivals Blackburn Rovers 5–2, on 6 February 1978, Brown was sacked by chairman Billy Cartmell for personal reasons. The team won only one more game that season, which ended with their relegation to the Division Three for the first time in their history.

On 1 April 1978, with six games to go, Blackpool were in eighth place, nine points off the third relegation slot. On 25 April, with one game to go, Blackpool were 14th, three points above Cardiff City in the third relegation slot. Four days later, Blackpool completed their programme and were 16th with 37 points – two points clear of Leyton Orient in the third relegation slot, with a vastly superior goal difference (−1, which was four better than fifth-placed Blackburn Rovers). At that point, all the teams below Blackpool still had games to play, apart from bottom placed Hull City. The bottom of the Division Two table read:

The only other team in the division with games to play was Notts County, in 14th place with 38 points.

After Millwall achieved safety by beating already-relegated Mansfield Town, the three remaining fixtures were Cardiff City v. Notts County, Leyton Orient v. Charlton Athletic, and Cardiff City v. Leyton Orient. Only one combination from the 27 possible outcomes of those three games would have resulted in all three teams getting more than 37 points and Blackpool being relegated. Inevitably, Cardiff City beat Notts County, Leyton Orient drew with Charlton and, in the final match, Leyton Orient, who up to that point had only won one away game all season, and had lost six out of their previous eight away games, with no wins, beat now-safe Cardiff City, who had lost only two home games all season and had won six out of their previous seven homes games, with no defeats. Blackpool were relegated with 37 points (the seven teams above them all having 38 ), and were not to return to the second tier for 29 years:

Bob Stokoe returned for a second stint as manager for the 1978–79 campaign, at the end of which Blackpool finished mid-table. Stokoe resigned during the summer.

Stan Ternent became Blackpool&#x27;s seventh manager in nine years, only to be replaced in February 1980 by Alan Ball, the popular former Blackpool midfielder who left the club for Everton 14 years earlier. Ball himself only lasted a year in the job, and departed when the club were relegated to the League&#x27;s basement division.

Allan Brown had taken over from Ball in February 1981, and he remained in charge for the following 1981–82 term. Blackpool finished twelfth in their first season in Division Four; however, unable to handle the pressure of the job, Brown resigned during the close season.

Sam Ellis took over from Brown in June 1982, three years after he finished his playing career with Watford. His first season saw Blackpool finish 21st, with Dave Bamber topping the club&#x27;s goalscoring chart for the second consecutive season with 10 strikes.

It was Ellis&#x27;s third season, however, that brought the success the club had been looking for. Blackpool finished second behind Chesterfield and were back in Division Three.

The club managed to finish in the top half of the table for their first three seasons in the Third Division, but slipped to 19th in Ellis&#x27;s seventh and final season in charge.

On 17 April 1986, the board of directors put the club on the market after councillors rejected plans to sell Bloomfield Road for a supermarket site in a £35 million redevelopment scheme. The club was then sold to Owen Oyston for £1.

For the 1989–90 season, Blackpool appointed Jimmy Mullen as manager. Mullen&#x27;s reign last only 11 months, however, and he left the club after their relegation back to Division Four.

Graham Carr replaced Mullen, but his spell in the manager&#x27;s seat was even shorter – just four months. He was sacked in November 1990 with Blackpool in 18th place.

Carr&#x27;s replacement was his assistant, Billy Ayre. Ayre guided the team to a fifth-placed finish and qualification for the play-offs. They lost only five of their 30 league games that remained at the time of Ayre&#x27;s appointment. The run included 13 consecutive home league wins in an eventual 24–game unbeaten run at Bloomfield Road. The run was extended to 15 consecutive home wins at the start of the 1991–92 campaign, which remains the club record.

After beating Scunthorpe United in the two-legged semi-finals of the play-offs, Blackpool lost to Torquay United in the Wembley final, on penalties after the score was tied 2–2 after regular and extra time.

The following 1991–92 season finished with Blackpool in fourth place, missing out on automatic promotion by one point, which meant another play-offs experience. This time they met Barnet in the semi-finals and won 2–1 on aggregate. They returned to Wembley, where they faced Scunthorpe United in the final, the team they knocked out of the play-offs 12 months earlier. Again the score was tied at the end of regular and extra time, but Blackpool were victorious in the penalty shootout and booked their place in the new Division Two.

Blackpool struggled in their first term back in the third tier of English football but pulled to safety in 18th place by the end. In late 1993 they were as high as fourth but tumbled down the table in the second half of that season to miss the drop by a whisker in 20th, avoiding relegation by virtue of a 4–1 victory over Leyton Orient on the final day of the season. Ayre was sacked in the summer of 1994 and was replaced by Sam Allardyce.

Allardyce led Blackpool to a mid-table finish in his first season and saw the club knocked out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle. Tony Ellis was the club&#x27;s top scorer with 17 league goals.

The 1995–96 season saw Blackpool finish third and claim a place in the play-offs for the third time in six seasons. In the semi-finals, Blackpool travelled to Bradford City and won 2–0. Three days later, they hosted the Yorkshiremen at Bloomfield Road and lost 3–0. Blackpool remained in Division Two, and Allardyce was sacked not long afterwards.

In 1996, owner Oyston was convicted of the rape of a 16-year-old girl.
Former Norwich City manager Gary Megson replaced Allardyce, and attained a seventh-placed finish in his only season in charge. Nigel Worthington succeeded Megson in the summer of 1997, and in the Northern Irishman&#x27;s two full campaigns in the hot seat, Blackpool finished 12th and 14th. Worthington resigned towards the end of the 1999–2000 season, and his seat was filled by the former Liverpool and England midfielder Steve McMahon.

===Rise to the Premier League (2001–2010)===
McMahon arrived too late to save the club from relegation to the Third Division (fourth tier) after a 22nd-placed finish in the table. In his first full season in charge, Blackpool were promoted to Division Two by winning the play-offs. The following season the club received its then record outgoing transfer fee; £1.75million from Southampton for Brett Ormerod, eclipsing the £600,000 QPR paid for Trevor Sinclair eight years earlier. They also gained the first of two Football League Trophy wins in 2002 as Blackpool beat Cambridge United 4–1 at the Millennium Stadium. Their second win was in 2004, this time beating Southend United 2–0 again in Cardiff. In the summer following the Trophy win, McMahon resigned, believing he could not take the club any further with the budget he was being offered. Colin Hendry became the new manager, but was replaced by Simon Grayson in November 2005 after an unsuccessful stint which left Blackpool languishing just above the relegation zone of League One (third tier).

In the 2006–07 FA Cup Blackpool reached the fourth round for the first time in 17 years, after beating Aldershot Town 4–2 at Bloomfield Road, but were knocked out by Norwich City, 3–2 after a replay at Carrow Road. They finished in third place, and qualified for the play-offs, and as top scorers in League One with 76 goals. After beating Oldham Athletic 5–2 on aggregate in the semi-final they met Yeovil Town in the final at the new Wembley Stadium, their first appearance at England&#x27;s national stadium in 15 years. Blackpool won 2–0, a club-record 10th consecutive victory, and were promoted to the Championship in their 100th overall season in the Football League. The promotion marked their return to English football&#x27;s second tier for the first time in 29 years.

Blackpool knocked Premier League side Derby County out of the League Cup at the second-round stage on 28 August 2007. The match ended 1–1 after 90 minutes and 2–2 after extra time. The Seasiders won the resulting penalty shootout 7–6. On 25 September, Blackpool beat Southend United 2–1 after extra time to reach the fourth round for the first time in 35 years. They were drawn away to Premiership side Tottenham Hotspur in the last 16, a match they lost 2–0. Tottenham went on to win the competition.

Blackpool finished the 2007–08 season in 19th place, escaping relegation by two points and ensuring their safety in a 1–1 draw with Watford on the final day of the Championship season.

On 23 December 2008, Simon Grayson left the club to join League One club Leeds United after just over three years in charge at Bloomfield Road. Under the guidance of Grayson&#x27;s assistant Tony Parkes, as caretaker manager, Blackpool finished the 2008–09 campaign in 16th place. Parkes left the club on 18 May 2009 after a meeting with chairman Karl Oyston about finances.

On 21 May 2009, Ian Holloway was appointed as manager, signing a one-year contract with the club with an option of a further year. On 31 July it was announced that club president Valērijs Belokoņs was setting up a new transfer fund, into which he was adding a &quot;considerable amount&quot; to invest in new players identified by Holloway. Four days later Blackpool broke their transfer record by signing Charlie Adam from Scottish champions Rangers for £500,000, topping the £275,000 paid to Millwall for Chris Malkin in 1996.

Blackpool finished the 2009–10 regular season in sixth place in the Championship, their highest finish in the Football League since 1970–71, and claimed a spot in the play-offs. On 2 May 2010, the 57th anniversary of Blackpool&#x27;s FA Cup final victory, Blackpool hosted Bristol City for the final League game of the season. They needed to match or better Swansea City&#x27;s result in their match at home to Doncaster Rovers. Both matches ended in draws, with Swansea&#x27;s Lee Trundle having a late goal disallowed for handball, which meant Blackpool secured the remaining play-off place.

On 8 May, Blackpool beat Nottingham Forest 2–1 at Bloomfield Road in the semi-final first leg. Three days later, they beat them 4–3 (6–4 on aggregate) at the City Ground in the second leg to progress to the final against Cardiff. The result meant Blackpool had beaten Forest in all four of the clubs&#x27; meetings in 2009–10.

Blackpool defeated Cardiff City 3–2 on 22 May in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium to earn promotion to the Premier League. It was Blackpool&#x27;s debut appearance in the Premier League in its 18-year existence and their first appearance in English football&#x27;s top flight in 39 years. Blackpool had now, uniquely, been promoted through all three tiers of the Football League via the play-off system. Furthermore, they won all nine play-off games they were involved in during the 10 seasons between 2001 and 2010. The fixture was dubbed &quot;the richest game in football&quot;, because the victorious club would receive a £90 million windfall. It was more than double the £36 million that the winners of the Champions League received.

On 24 May, a promotion parade was held along Blackpool&#x27;s promenade for the club&#x27;s personnel, who travelled on an open-top double-decker bus from Gynn Square down the Golden Mile to the Waterloo Headland. The police estimated that about 100,000 people lined the route. At the Headland, the manager and squad took to a stage to address the gathered mass crowd. &quot;This is the most unbelievable moment of my life,&quot; said Ian Holloway. &quot;I&#x27;ve jumped on the best ride of my life and I don&#x27;t want to go home.&quot;

===Premier League campaign (2010–11)===
In their first-ever Premier League match on 14 August 2010, Blackpool defeated Wigan Athletic 4–0 at the DW Stadium. The result saw &quot;the Seasiders&quot; at the top of the entire English football pyramid until Chelsea&#x27;s 6–0 victory over West Bromwich Albion later in the day. It was the first time they had been in such a position since they won their opening game of the 1957–58 top-flight campaign. The initial fixture list had the game being played at Bloomfield Road, but the Premier League allowed the fixture to be reversed because construction work on Bloomfield Road&#x27;s East Stand had not been completed in time.

On 27 January 2011, the Premier League fined Blackpool £25,000 for fielding what they believed to be a weakened team against Aston Villa on 10 November. Ian Holloway, who initially threatened to resign if punishment was dealt, had made 10 changes to the team for the fixture. The club had 14 days to appeal against the decision but chose not to, with Karl Oyston saying that if the punishment was upheld there was a threat of a point deduction and an increase in the fine.

On 22 May 2011, exactly 365 days after their promotion, Blackpool were relegated back to the Championship after losing 4–2 at champions Manchester United on the final day of the season, though results elsewhere also impacted the final league standings. Despite predictions that they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t get 10 points,&quot; Blackpool took 39 from their 38 games, including home and away victories over Liverpool, consecutive away wins at Stoke City and Sunderland, and a home victory over Tottenham Hotspur. Seven of their 10 overall wins were obtained before the new year, and at the end of 2010 they sat in eighth place; however, seven defeats in the opening eight fixtures of 2011 saw them drop down the table. The next match, a draw at home Aston Villa, left them in 15th, their lowest placing of the campaign to date. Another run of defeats – this time five in six – put them in the relegation zone for the first time. They climbed out of the bottom three, at the expense of Wigan Athletic, with successive home draws against Newcastle United and Stoke City. Blackpool dropped back into the relegation zone after conceding a late equaliser to draw at Tottenham, switching places with Wolves; they were level on points with Wigan and three ahead of bottom club West Ham United. A victory, their first in three months, over Bolton Wanderers, in their penultimate league fixture, was not enough to change the position as Wolves won at Sunderland. Blackpool went to Old Trafford for the final match and were leading 2–1 12 minutes into the second half, but Manchester United, who were crowned champions a week earlier, took control and won 4–2 to condemn 19th-placed Blackpool to relegation along with Birmingham City and West Ham United.

===Fall to the fourth tier (2011–2017)===
In July 2011, Blackpool smashed their outgoing transfer record when Charlie Adam signed for Liverpool in a £7-million deal. A portion of these funds was used to bring former Scotland, Rangers, Blackburn Rovers and Birmingham captain Barry Ferguson to Bloomfield Road, where he once again assumed the armband. On 9 May 2012, Blackpool secured their place in the Championship play-off final in their second consecutive season in the division after beating Birmingham City 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals. They met West Ham United in the final at Wembley on 19 May, losing 2–1, conceding a last-gasp goal to &quot;the Hammers&quot;″ Ricardo Vaz Tê, their first play-off final reversal in 21 years.

On 3 November 2012, Ian Holloway decided to leave Blackpool after accepting an offer from fellow Championship club Crystal Palace to be their manager. He was replaced four days later by Michael Appleton, who left League One side Portsmouth to take up the position; however, after being in charge for just two months, Appleton left for Lancashire neighbours Blackburn Rovers, becoming the shortest-serving manager in Blackpool&#x27;s history. On 18 February, after just over a month without an appointment, the club made former England captain Paul Ince their third manager of the campaign. It was under Ince that the club made their best-ever start to a league season. Their victory at AFC Bournemouth on 14 September 2013 gave them 16 points out of a possible 18. The sequence of results was two wins, a draw, and three wins. This was countered by a run of nine defeats in 10 games, which resulted in Ince being sacked on 21 January 2014, 11 months into his tenure.

Barry Ferguson was named caretaker manager upon Ince&#x27;s dismissal. Of Ferguson&#x27;s 20 league games in charge, Blackpool won just three and finished the 2013–14 season in 20th place. On 11 June 2014, almost five months after Paul Ince&#x27;s dismissal, the club appointed Belgian José Riga as manager. He was Blackpool&#x27;s first overseas manager.

Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season Blackpool suffered a major crisis with some 27 players leaving the club; just two weeks before the season started, the club had only eight outfield players and no goalkeeper. Riga was able to assemble a squad in time for Blackpool&#x27;s first game against Nottingham Forest, but could still only name four substitutes instead of the permitted seven. Blackpool lost the match 2–0. On 27 October 2014, after 15 games in charge, Riga was sacked and replaced by Lee Clark.

On 6 April 2015, with six league fixtures remaining, Blackpool were relegated to League One. On 2 May 2015, the final match of the Championship season against Huddersfield Town was abandoned in the 48th minute following an on-pitch protest by hundreds of Blackpool supporters regarding the actions and management style of the directors and owners. The Football League subsequently declared the result the 0–0 scoreline it was at the time of abandonment, which meant Blackpool finished the season with 26 points. Following the resignation of Lee Clark on 9 May 2015, Blackpool appointed Neil McDonald as manager on 2 June.

In May 2016, a second successive relegation occurred, which put Blackpool in the bottom tier of English professional football for the first time in 15 years. Less than two weeks later, Neil McDonald was sacked as manager. He was replaced by Gary Bowyer, the club&#x27;s eighth manager in three-and-a-half years.

In late 2016, as the sexual abuse scandal developed, former Blackpool player Paul Stewart alleged he had been abused by Frank Roper, a coach associated with Blackpool in the 1980s.

In May 2017, under Bowyer, Blackpool won promotion to League One after beating Exeter City 2–1 at Wembley in the play-off final. The victory meant that Blackpool became the most successful side in English play-off history, winning their fifth final.

===End of the Oyston era (2017–2019)===

On 10 November 2017, Blackpool was put up for sale by the Oyston family. The sale included the club itself and the properties division that owns Bloomfield Road stadium.

On 2 February 2018, Owen Oyston relieved Karl Oyston of his role as chairman and appointed his 32-year-old daughter, Natalie Christopher, in his place, just two weeks after appointing her to the club&#x27;s board.

Gary Bowyer resigned in August 2018 after two years in charge, after the first game of the season for undisclosed reasons. He was replaced with his assistant Terry McPhillips as caretaker manager. McPhillips was made the permanent manager a month later.

On 13 February 2019, the football club was put into receivership by the High Court, which forced Owen Oyston to pay ex-director Valērijs Belokoņs some of the £25m he was owed. Oyston was removed from the board of the club by the receiver on 25 February 2019. The receiver was tasked with discharging some of Oyston&#x27;s assets, as well as Blackpool Football Club (Properties) Ltd, which owns the football club. The ruling could have resulted in the club being deducted 12 league points; however, this was eventually ruled against by the EFL on 11 April 2019.

=== Under new ownership (2019–present) ===
On 13 June 2019, Simon Sadler was announced as the new owner of the club, officially ending the Oystons&#x27; 32-year tenure, purchasing a 96.2% stake. Sadler was born and raised in Blackpool and has worked in asset management in Hong Kong since 2007. He is the founder and Chief Investment Officer of Segantii Capital Management.

Terry McPhillips resigned as Blackpool manager on 5 July 2019, having informed the club&#x27;s board that he had no long-term desire to be a manager. He was replaced by Simon Grayson, who returned for a second spell in charge; however, after a long run of defeats, he was sacked on 12 February 2020. Grayson&#x27;s last game in charge was a 3–2 home loss to Gillingham. Liverpool U23s manager Neil Critchley was appointed head coach – the first such role for the club – as his replacement on 2 March 2020. After a curtailed regular season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, Blackpool finished the 2019–20 season in 13th position after standings were amended to reflect a points-per-game ratio.

At the end of the following campaign, Blackpool were promoted back to the second tier of English football, after a six-year absence, after winning the 2021 EFL League One play-off final. It was Blackpool&#x27;s sixth victory in a play-off final in eight such appearances.

The 2021-22 season saw Blackpool secure a sixteenth-place finish in the Championship. On 2 June 2022, Neil Critchley resigned from his role as head coach and joined Aston Villa as assistant head coach. Critchley told Simon Sadler he was keen to work again with Steven Gerrard and &quot;pit himself against some of the best coaches in the world&quot;. Just over two weeks later, the club appointed its former manager Michael Appleton as Critchley&#x27;s successor. Appleton was sacked seven months later, on 18 January 2023, after the club managed one win in eleven games. Veteran Mick McCarthy was appointed to oversee the rest of the season, but an Easter Monday defeat at home to fellow strugglers Cardiff City ended his spell in charge. Interim manager and former &quot;Seasiders&quot; striker Stephen Dobbie could not keep them in the division. Blackpool were relegated to League One after a home defeat to Millwall on 28 April 2023.

Neil Critchley returned for a second spell as manager in the summer, and the following 2023–24 season saw an eighth-placed finish in League One, two places outside the play-off positions. He was sacked in August 2024. On 3 September 2024, Steve Bruce was appointed as head coach.

In January 2025, it was revealed that Sadler was looking to sell the club as he faces accusations of insider trading with Segantii.

==Colours==

Blackpool first began wearing tangerine for the 1923–24 season, after a recommendation from referee Albert Hargreaves, who officiated an international match between the Netherlands and Belgium and was impressed by the Dutchmen&#x27;s colours.

Before changing to tangerine permanently, the team tried several different colours: blue-and-white striped shirts in the 1890s (becoming known as &quot;the&quot; Merry Stripes); a mixture of red or white shirts at the turn of the 20th century; and, during the First World War, black, yellow and red. The latter was adopted to include the colours of the flag of Belgium, a show of support for the large number of Belgian refugees that had arrived in the town. After the war, they wore white shirts and navy-blue shorts. The board introduced another change in 1934 when the team appeared in alternating dark- and light-blue stripes (which have been reintroduced several times in the mid-1990s and 2002, for Blackpool&#x27;s return to the top flight in 2010 as the club&#x27;s third kit, and as their away kit in 2019–20), but they bowed to public pressure in 1939 and settled on tangerine. Between 1938 and 1958 Blackpool&#x27;s kit consisted of tangerine shirts, white shorts and navy blue socks. The club now uses tangerine socks, though navy was used as a secondary colour in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==Stadium==

Blackpool have played their home games at Bloomfield Road since 1901. The stadium&#x27;s current capacity is 16,616, all-seated.

In the summer of 2010, work was done on the stadium to prepare for the club&#x27;s debut season in the Premier League. A new 5,120-capacity temporary East Stand was built, together with improvements to the floodlighting, media and medical facilities and the dugouts. Painting work was also done on the Stanley Matthews (West) Stand and the Mortensen Kop (North Stand). A new video screen was also installed. A new South Stand named after Jimmy Armfield was opened in 2010 with 3,600 seats. From the first home game in the Premier League, against Fulham on 28 August 2010, the capacity was 16,220, the highest at Bloomfield Road in 30 years.

In the 2011–12 season, the south east corner between the Armfield Stand and the temporary East Stand was filled with an additional 500 seats, the area also incorporating the BFC Hotel, which welcomed its first guests at the end of June 2012. It was officially opened on 26 July 2012, the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary. The hotel has a four-star rating, although the source of the accreditation is not specified on its website. It also houses a conference centre. From the 2015–16 season to Blackpool&#x27;s homecoming game against Southend United, the East Stand had been closed to fans. In the latter part of the 2018–19 EFL League One season, away fans moved to the North-East Stand. As of the 2019–20 season, away fans are now accommodated in the East Stand.

==Supporters==
Blackpool supporters are known by the general terms Tangerine Army or Seaside Barmy Army. Whilst Blackpool had the lowest average home attendance in the Premier League, the atmosphere generated by the home support was regarded as loud and intimidating.

After Steve McMahon resigned as Blackpool manager in 2004, he said of the Tangerine support: &quot;During my time here, the supporters have been fantastic and are a credit to the club. Whilst they have that support, I am sure they can go a long way. I think both on and off the pitch the club is going forward in a big way and unfortunately I&#x27;m not part of that anymore.&quot; The club was promoted three years later to the Championship, and again in 2010 to the Premier League for the 2010–11 season.

In September 2009, freelance journalist Mike Whalley said after attending a game against Peterborough United: &quot;The home fans certainly make plenty of noise. Bloomfield Road does not lack for atmosphere. Or a drummer. Every home game is played to a thumping drum beat.&quot; After Blackpool beat Newcastle United 2–1 on 16 September 2009, Scott Wilson of &quot;the Northern Echo&quot; wrote: &quot;Almost 10,000 spectators created a hostile and intimidating atmosphere that was a throwback to footballing days gone by&quot; while the Sky Sports match report described the Blackpool support as &quot;boisterous&quot;.

On 28 August 2010 Blackpool played Fulham in their first-ever home Premier League game, in front of a crowd of 15,529, the largest attendance for over 30 years at Bloomfield Road. On Sky Sports&#x27; &quot;Football First&quot; programme, co-commentator Barry Horne said: &quot;They are a fantastic crowd. I&#x27;ve watched a lot of Championship games here and the crowd have always been brilliant; they get behind their team.&quot; Commentator Will Cope later said: &quot;It&#x27;s deafening; deafening by the seaside. You wouldn&#x27;t have thought 15,000 fans could make so much noise.&quot; After the game Fulham manager Mark Hughes also praised the home support saying that the atmosphere in the stadium would really help the team in their debut season in the Premier League.

During the 2010–11 Premier League campaign, a decibel-metre was set up three times at each stadium, and an average then taken to indicate the loudest supporters. Despite having a capacity of 16,220, the Blackpool support was ranked the fifth-loudest, at 85 decibels.

In January 2013, a supporters&#x27; group named SISA (Seasiders Independent Supporters Association) was formed. It folded in July the following year to become Blackpool Supporters Trust.

Blackpool Fans&#x27; Progress Group, a supporters&#x27; liaison group, was founded in 2015.

===Rivalries===
Blackpool&#x27;s primary rival is Preston North End – the two clubs&#x27; grounds being seventeen miles apart – and matches between the two clubs are known as the West Lancashire derby. They have met 96 times across all four divisions of the Football League, including the old First Division, and eight times in either the FA Cup and League Cup (Blackpool having won none of the ties).

Since 2012–13, a Fylde Coast derby has developed with Fleetwood Town. Eight-and-a-half miles separate Bloomfield Road and &quot;The Fishermen&quot;″s Highbury Stadium.

According to a survey conducted in 2019, Blackpool&#x27;s other significant rivalries are with Bolton Wanderers, Burnley and Blackburn Rovers.

==Sponsors==


1 Derek Woodman BMW sponsored the club&#x27;s home shorts, while Derek Woodman Mini sponsored their away versions

2 Blackpool Leisure were the shorts sponsors

3 Tower Insurance were the shorts sponsors

Between the 2005–06 season and the 2009–10 season, Glyn Jones Estate Agents appeared in the back of their home shirts, while JMB Properties Ltd. appeared on the back of their away shirts. For the 2020–21 season, FTS became the back-of-shirt sponsor.
==Players==
===First-team squad===











===Out on loan===





===Reserve team===
Up until the 2009–10 season the reserve team competed in the Central League Division One West. They have been Central League champions twice, in 1919–20 and 1949–50.

With the first team promoted to the Premier League, for the 2010–11 season the reserves competed in the Premier Reserve League. They were in North Group B, with Blackburn Rovers, Everton, Liverpool and Sunderland. At the end of the campaign, the club withdrew from reserve league football, preferring to play such games behind closed doors.

Blackpool reintroduced reserve-team football for the 2019–20 season. They joined a regional five-team Central Division. But at the end of the 2023-24 season, it was announced that the team would withdraw from the Central Division, with the club opting for loan-based development for younger players coming through the ranks.

=== Academy ===
The club&#x27;s Academy, headed by Ciaran Donnelly, is rated as Category 3 (the highest, of four categories, being Category 1). It consists of an under-18s squad and a development squad. As of 2021, the academy had around 140 players, ranging in age from six to twenty-one, and employed twelve full-time members of staff. Its facilities are split between Myerscough College and Blackpool&#x27;s Stanley Park.

===Internationals===
Blackpool have had 61 full-international representatives. Their first was Fred Griffiths, for Wales, in 1900. Their most recent was CJ Hamilton, for the Republic of Ireland, in 2022. In 1996, Northern Ireland&#x27;s James Quinn became the club&#x27;s first player in sixteen years to be selected for a full international, the previous one being Derek Spence in 1980.

:&quot;Many players won additional caps with other clubs, but the totals given below apply solely to appearances made while with Blackpool.&quot;

===One-club men===

Nine players spent their entire professional playing careers with Blackpool:


===Training facility===
Blackpool&#x27;s training ground, currently known as the e-Energy Training Centre, is located in the Squires Gate area of Blackpool&#x27;s South Shore. It has been used, with minimal upkeep, since the 1940s. It was described by Blackpool manager Ian Holloway as a &quot;hell hole&quot; in 2009, shortly after which chairman Karl Oyston pledged to build a new facility. &quot;We are never going back to our training ground again,&quot; explained Holloway. &quot;Every player this club has ever had hates it, and every player we have is frightened of it. It is a horrible environment to work in.&quot; In 2009, with the training ground frozen, Holloway attempted to train on Blackpool&#x27;s beach, but that too was iced over. An initial plan was to use the facilities of Fylde Rugby Club, but training is still held at the two-pitch Squires Gate, however, and no development has come to fruition.

In August 2014, former Blackpool defender Alex Baptiste reminisced on his time at Squires Gate: &quot;No balls in training, having to run on the beach because the pitch had been frozen for two weeks, no food after training, leaks in the Portacabins, having to buy our own weights – just random stuff like that! It was definitely an experience!&quot;

In June 2020, the club purchased a modular building for the training ground. It includes changing facilities for players and staff, along with eating areas, meeting rooms and medical facilities.

A site for a new training facility, bordering the Grange Park Estate and Baines School on Garstang Road, was purchased in May 2022. The new training facility, combined with replacing Bloomfield Road&#x27;s temporary East Stand with a permanent structure, is estimated to cost between £30 and £40 million. A planning application was expected to be submitted in May 2023.

==Managers==
Including repeat appointments, there have been 42 full-time managers of Blackpool F.C., the first being Bill Norman between 1918 and 1923. The longest-serving manager was Joe Smith, who occupied the role for 23 years; Michael Appleton, meanwhile, lasted 65 days in the role in his first stint at the club. Blackpool has, on average, appointed a new manager just under every three years. As of May 2024, the club has had thirteen full-time managers in twelve years.

There have been five repeat appointments: Bob Stokoe, Allan Brown, Simon Grayson, Michael Appleton and Neil Critchley.

In 2014, Jose Riga became the club&#x27;s first foreign manager.

In 2020, Neil Critchley became the first appointment to be known as a head coach.

<text>Liberec (; ) is a city in the Czech Republic. It has about 108,000 inhabitants, making it the fifth largest city in the country. It lies on the Lusatian Neisse River, in a basin surrounded by mountains. The city centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

Liberec was once home to a thriving textile industry and hence nicknamed the &quot;Manchester of Bohemia&quot;. For many Czechs, Liberec is mostly associated with the city&#x27;s dominant Ještěd Tower. Since the end of the 19th century, the city has been a conurbation with the suburb of Vratislavice nad Nisou and the neighbouring city of Jablonec nad Nisou.

In the early 1990s, some parts became independent municipalities: Stráž nad Nisou (formerly Liberec XXVI-Stráž nad Nisou and Liberec XXVII-Svárov), Dlouhý Most (formerly Liberec XXXVI-Dlouhý Most), Jeřmanice (formerly Liberec XXXVII-Jeřmanice) and Šimonovice (formerly Liberec XXXVIII-Minkovice and Liberec XXXIX-Šimonovice).

Vratislavice nad Nisou is declared a self-governing borough, while the rest of the city is governed directly.

==Etymology==
The oldest known names of the city are German, Reychinberch (1352) and Reychmberg (1369), meaning &quot;rich/resourceful mountain&quot; (&quot;reicher Berg&quot; in modern German). It was also spelled Reichenberg (1385–1399) and Rychmberg (1410).

The Czech equivalent originated as a distortion: Rychberk (1545), Libercum (1634), Liberk (1790), and finally Liberec (1845). In Czech, words starting with &quot;R&quot; were often dissimilated into &quot;L&quot;. Since then, the city was known as Liberec in Czech and as Reichenberg in German.

==Geography==

Liberec is located about northeast of Prague. Most of the municipal territory lies in the Zittau Basin. In the northeast, the territory extends into the Jizera Mountains and to the eponymous protected landscape area. In the west, the territory extends into the Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge and includes the highest point of Liberec and of the entire Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge, the mountain Ještěd at above sea level.

Liberec is situated on the Lusatian Neisse River. The largest body of water is Harcov Reservoir (also called Liberec Dam). The reservoir is located inside the built-up area on the Lusatian Neisse&#x27;s tributary, the stream of Harcovský potok. Today it serves mainly as a recreational place for the residents of Liberec, but it was originally designed to protect the city from floods and as a water reservoir for industrial use. It is also important as a biotope with the occurrence of protected animals.

===Climate===
Liberec has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dcbo&quot;). The annual average temperature is , the hottest month in July is , and the coldest month is in January. The annual precipitation is , of which July is the wettest with , while April is the driest with only . The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from on 11 February 1929 to on 16 July 1928.
==History==


===11th–16th centuries===
In the 11th or 12th century, a settlement named Habersdorf, which was the predecessor of Liberec, was established on the trade route from Bohemia to Lusatia by Czech settlers and German colonizers. In the 13th century, a second settlement named Reichenberg was established near the first one. The two settlements later merged. The first written mention of Liberec under its German name Reichenberg is from 1352.

Starting in 1278, the area was owned by the noble Bieberstein family. Reichenberg suffered from the passing through of troops during the Hussite Wars, then was burned down in 1469 during a battle with the army of King George of Poděbrady. After the Biebersteins died out, the Frýdlant estate, which included Reichenberg, was bought by the Redern family in 1558. The Rederns contributed significantly to the development of the settlement, as they built new buildings, modernized the settlement and laid the foundation of the textile industry. In 1577, Reichenberg was promoted to a town by Emperor Rudolf II. He gave the town the coat of arms it still uses today.

===17th–19th centuries===
From 1600, the town was administered by Kateřina of Redern, who obtained the right to trade in salt for the town, had a chapel added to the castle and contributed to the construction of the town hall. When the Redern family was forced to leave Reichenberg after the Battle of White Mountain (1620), it was acquired by Albrecht von Wallenstein. After his death it belonged to the Gallas and Clam Gallas families, who did not care much about the town. The prosperous local industry was interrupted by the Thirty Years&#x27; War and a great plague in 1680. The crises resulted in a series of harshly suppressed serf uprisings.

In the 18th century, Reichenberg flourished. The number of inhabitants tripled and the cloth industry was very successful. The Battle of Reichenberg between Austria and Prussia occurred nearby in 1757 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, but the town continued to develop. During the 19th century, the town became the centre of textile industry for all of Austria-Hungary. In 1850, it became a self-governing city.

Reichenberg became a rich industrial city without representative buildings. In the late 19th century, a spectacular collection of representative buildings was created, mostly in the neo-Renaissance style: the city hall, the opera house, the North Bohemian Museum, the Old Synagogue, and others. A representative villa district and a forest with a botanical garden and a zoo were created.

===20th century===
Until 1918, the city was part of Austria-Hungary, seat of the Reichenberg district, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia. After the end of World War I, Austria-Hungary fell apart and the Czechs of Bohemia joined newly established Czechoslovakia on 29 October 1918 whilst the Germans wanted to stay with Austria to form reduced German Austria on 12 November 1918, both citing Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and the doctrine of self-determination. Liberec was declared the capital of the German-Austrian province of German Bohemia. Czechs however argued that these lands, though German-settled since the Middle Ages, were historically an integral part of the Duchy and Kingdom of Bohemia. On 16 December 1918, the Czechoslovak Army entered Liberec and the whole province remained part of Bohemia.

The Great Depression devastated the economy of the area with its textile, carpet, glass and other light industry. The high number of unemployed people, hunger, fear of the future and dissatisfaction with the Prague government led to the flash rise of the populist Sudeten German Party (SdP), founded by Konrad Henlein, born in the suburbs of Liberec. The city became the centre of Pan-German movements and later of the Nazis, especially after the 1935 election, despite its important democratic mayor, Karl Kostka (German Democratic Freedom Party). The final change came in Summer 1938, after the radicalization of the terror of the SdP, whose death threats forced Kostka and his family to flee to Prague.

In September 1938, the Munich Agreement awarded the city to Nazi Germany. In 1939, it became the capital of Reichsgau Sudetenland. Most of the city&#x27;s Jewish and Czech population fled to the rest of Czechoslovakia or were expelled. The important synagogue was burned down. Henlein himself confiscated a villa in Liberec that had belonged to a Jewish businessman, which remained Henlein&#x27;s home until 1945.

After World War II, the city again became a part of Czechoslovakia and nearly all of the city&#x27;s German population was expelled following the Beneš decrees. The region was then resettled with Czechs.

<text>Tábor (; ) is a town in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 34,000 inhabitants, which makes it the second most populated town in the region. The town was founded by the Hussites in 1420. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Tábor consists of 15 municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Tábor (25,625)
*Čekanice (1,355)
*Čelkovice (680)
*Hlinice (208)
*Horky (1,047)
*Klokoty (1,092)
*Měšice (1,759)
*Náchod (340)
*Smyslov (58)
*Stoklasná Lhota (180)
*Větrovy (393)
*Všechov (37)
*Zahrádka (49)
*Záluží (189)
*Zárybničná Lhota (348)
==Etymology==
Although the town&#x27;s Czech name translates directly to &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;encampment&quot;, these words were derived from the Tábor&#x27;s name, and the town was named after the biblical Mount Tabor located in Israel. The town also gave its name to the Taborites, a radical wing of the Hussites. Tábor was initially called &quot;Hradiště hory Tábor&quot; (&quot;fortified settlement of the Tábor mountain&quot;).

==Geography==

Tábor is located about north of České Budějovice and south of Prague. It lies on the river Lužnice.

Tábor is located in the Tábor Uplands. The highest point is the Hýlačka hill with an altitude of and the lowest is the surface of the river Lužnice. The historic old town is situated on a hill above the river, which was used for the protection of the town.

In the middle of the town lies the Jordán Reservoir, which was created in 1492 and named after the biblical Jordan River. It was originally used for storage of water, but nowadays it is mainly used for recreation. It is the oldest reservoir in Central Europe. There are also many fish ponds in the municipal territory.

==History==
The area is known to have been settled since the early Iron Age (6th–5th century BC). The next permanent settlement is documented in the Middle Ages. In around 1270, a short-lived settlement called Hradiště (meaning &quot;gord&quot;) was founded, which was destroyed most likely in a rebellion against King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1276.

Tábor was founded in the spring of 1420, probably by Petr Hromádka of Jistebnice and other members of the most radical wing of the Hussites, who became known as the Taborites. Soon after the Taborites were victorious in the Battle of Tábor. The fortified settlement became the base from which the Hussites led their victorious expeditions. After the defeat of the Hussites in the Battle of Lipany, the Taborites reconciled with King Sigismund, and in 1437, it was promoted by Sigismund to a royal town. In 1452, the town surrendered to the troops under the command of the country&#x27;s steward of George of Poděbrady.

From the end of the 15th century, the rapid development of Tábor occurred, which began to look like a real town and formed into its present form. Most of its landmarks were built in the 16th century. Great fires in 1532 and 1559 destroyed most of the citizens&#x27; houses which were usually made of wood, but the fires also became an impetus for further construction development.

In 1547, the town refused to provide military assistance to King Ferdinand I in his campaign against the German Lutherans. Ferdinand I punished Tábor by confiscation of vast lands which were the source of prosperity of the town. After the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 the town did not surrender to the rule of King Ferdinand II and so the Imperial Army under the command of general Marradas began the half-year long siege that ended in November 1621 when the town surrendered mainly due to lack of food. In 1648, the town was stormed and looted by Swedish army. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, a long period of peace occurred and the town recovered. In the mid-17th century, the monks from the Order of Discalced Augustinians were invited to spread the Catholic faith.

Until 1918, &quot;Tabor – Tábor&quot; was part of Austria-Hungary, in the district with the same name, one of the 94 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Bohemia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The Tábor Hospital is by far the largest employer based in the town. The largest industrial employer is Brisk Tábor, producer of spark plugs. The tradition of this production in Tábor dates back to 1935. 

There is a military base that hosts 42nd Mechanized Battalion of the 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade. Czech Armed Forces Territorial Command headquarters is also located in the town.

==Transport==
Tábor is a significant transport hub. It lies on the mainline railway linking Prague with České Budějovice and Linz and local branch lines to Písek, Pelhřimov and Bechyně. The Tábor–Bechyně railway, built in 1903, was the first electrified railway line in Austria-Hungary.

The town also lies on the D3 motorway that is part of the European route E55 that connect it with Prague and České Budějovice. The other important road is the I/19 that connect Tábor with Plzeň, Písek, Pelhřimov and the D1 motorway in Humpolec. 

Tábor is also hub for a bus transportation network in the Tábor District and the northern part of the South Bohemian Region with bus terminal constructed just next to a train station.

==Sport==
The local football club FC Silon Táborsko plays in the second-level Czech National Football League.

Tábor is also equipped with a winter stadium. The local ice hockey club, HC Tábor, plays in the third-level ice hockey league.

Other sport facilities in Tábor include a swimming pool and the Komora sports complex.

The town hosts Cyklokros Tábor, an annual cyclo-cross race that is part of the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup.

==Sights==

Though a large part of the ancient fortifications has been demolished, Tábor still preserves many memorials of its past fame. The historical centre is formed by Žižka Square and adjacent streets, and is delimited by remains of the town walls. Only very narrow streets lead to it; this rendered the approach to the square more difficult in times of war. Many architecturally valuable burgher houses decorated by frescos, sgraffiti and gables are preserved, and represent almost all architectural styles.

Tábor is rich in monuments. There are four monuments, protected as national cultural monuments: Old Town Hall, Kotnov Castle with the Bechyně Gate, the monastery in Tábor-Klokoty with the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, and the Altar Wings of Roudníky in the Hussite Museum.

===Town fortifications===

The Kotnov Castle was probably founded at the end of the 13th century and was first documented in 1370. It was rebuilt into a brewery in the 16th century. The current appearance of the castle is the result of modifications made after 1860. Major parts of the town fortifications, including the Kotnov Tower and the Bechyně Gate near the tower, still exist. Kotnov Tower is a landmark on the town&#x27;s skyline, and today it serves as an observation tower.

A labyrinth of tunnels lies under the houses and streets. The townspeople dug cellars under their houses, and these were subsequently interconnected; an approximately -long section of the tunnel system is open to the public and is a part of the Hussite Museum.

===Main square===

The largest building on the square is the Dean Church of the Transfiguration of Jesus on the Mount Tabor. It was built in 1480–1512 in the style of the Bohemian Renaissance. In the centre of the square there are a Renaissance fountain from 1567–1568, and a statue of Jan Žižka, the greatest of the Hussite leaders. The statue was created in 1884 by Josef Strachovský and replaced a defective statue from 1877 by Josef Václav Myslbek.

The Old Town Hall was built in stages from 1420 to 1521 in late Gothic style. After it was damaged in the Thirty Year&#x27;s War, it was reconstructed in Baroque style, but in 1878 its late Gothic appearance was restored, and since then no major alterations have been made. Since 1960, its premises have been used for the Hussite Museum and galleries, and the largest and most representative hall is used for important cultural events. The museum contains interesting relics of the Hussite period such as the Altar Wings of Roudníky.

===Ecclesiastical buildings===

The second church in the historical centre is the Church of Nativity of the Virgin Mary in the complex of the Discalced Augustinian Monastery. The monastery complex was built on the site of abandoned houses in 1642–1666. The church has a Classical Baroque facade. At the beginning of the 19th century the monastery was closed down and the building was converted into a prison. Today, the local museum has its headquarters and depository there, and both the monastery and the church are inaccessible.

The former Church of Saints Philip and James is located below the town walls and is the oldest sacral building in Tábor. Its existence was first mentioned in 1377. It was originally a cemetery chapel, rebuilt as a Baroque church after 1744. Today it serves cultural purposes.

The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in Klokoty is a Baroque pilgrimage church. The church was built in 1700–1714 and in the following years, cloisters and chapels were added. It is one of the most valuable cultural monuments in the region. It still serves religious purposes. The way to it is lined with Stations of the Cross.

===Other cultural sights===
Měšice Castle is located in Měšice village. It was built in 1545 as a Renaissance fortress and redesigned into the Baroque style in 1699.

===Natural sights===
In Klokoty, there is the Pod Klokoty Geological Exposition along the Lužnice.

On the east edge of the town, there is a rock formation called (&quot;garnet rock&quot;). The rock is a deposit of red garnets that can be as large as hazelnuts and is protected as a nature monument. The majority of the rock was mined and used as construction material.

Tábor Zoo in Větrovy is the largest zoological garden in the South Bohemian Region with the area of . It was opened in 2015. In 2021, it bred 74 species. In 2021 it had almost 110,000 visitors.

The botanical garden in Tábor was founded in 1866, which makes it the second oldest in the country. It belongs to the neighbouring Secondary Agricultural School. It contains more than 4,000 plants and 400 trees. The seeds from there are sent to more than 400 places in the world. Most of the garden is occupied by an arboretum. There is a small lake and a rock garden. The three glasshouses contains cacti, succulents, orchids, carnivorous plants and many other exotic plants.

U Popraviště is the biggest park in Tábor. The park is built around a former gallows, which was used in 1942 during World War II. There is a monument to 156 victims of repression by the Nazi German occupiers that was built in 1947–1948, which includes a bronze board with lions and bronze relief board with figures. The rest of the park was created in the 1980s.

<text>Ophidiiformes is an order of ray-finned fish that includes the cusk-eels (family Ophidiidae), pearlfishes (family Carapidae), viviparous brotulas (family Bythitidae), and others. Members of this order have small heads and long slender bodies. They have either smooth scales or no scales, a long dorsal fin and an anal fin that typically runs into the caudal fin. They mostly come from the tropics and subtropics, and live in both freshwater and marine habitats, including abyssal depths. They have adopted a range of feeding methods and lifestyles, including parasitism. The majority are egg-laying, but some are viviparous.

The earliest fossil members are known from the Maastrichtian, and include the basal ophidiiform &quot;Pastorius&quot; from Italy and several species of the basal cusk-eel &quot;Ampheristus&quot; from the United States and Germany.

==Distribution==
This order includes a variety of deep-sea species, including the deepest known, &quot;Abyssobrotula galatheae&quot;, found at in the Puerto Rico Trench. Many other species, however, live in shallow water, especially near coral reefs, while a few inhabit freshwater. Most species live in tropical or subtropical habitats, but some species are known from as far north as the coast of Greenland, and as far south as the Weddell Sea.

==Characteristics==
Ophidiiform fish typically have slender bodies with small heads, and either smooth scales, or none at all. They have long dorsal fins, and an anal fin that is typically united with the caudal fin. The group includes pelagic, benthic, and even parasitic species, although all have a similar body form. Some species are viviparous, giving birth to live young, rather than laying eggs. They range in size from &quot;Grammanoides opisthodon&quot; which measures just in length, to &quot;Lamprogrammus shcherbachevi&quot; at in length.

The families Ranicipitidae (tadpole cods) and Euclichthyidae (eucla cods) were formerly classified in this order, but are now preferred in Gadiformes; Ranicipitidae has been absorbed within the family Gadidae.

==Timeline of genera==
==Classification==
The order Ophidiiformes is subdivided into suborders and families as follows:

* Genus †&quot;Pastorius&quot; (Late Cretaceous of Italy)
* Suborder Ophidioidei 
** Family Carapidae — pearlfishes
** Family Ophidiidae — cusk-eels
*Suborder Bythitoidei
** Family Bythitidae — viviparous brotulas
** Family Aphyonidae — aphyonids, blind cusk-eel
** Family Parabrotulidae — false brotulas

The suborder Ophidioidei may be a paraphyletic grouping but the suborder Bythitoidei are viviparous and seem to make up a monophyletic group, while the Ophidioidei are oviparous.

<text>Esch-sur-Alzette (, ; ; or &quot;Esch an der Alzig&quot;) is a city in Luxembourg and the country&#x27;s second-most populous commune, with a population of 36,625 inhabitants, . It lies in the south-west of the country, on the border with France and in the valley of the Alzette, which flows through the city. The city is usually referred to as just Esch; however, the full name distinguishes it from the village and commune of Esch-sur-Sûre which lies further north. The country&#x27;s capital, Luxembourg City, is roughly to the north-east. Esch was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2022, alongside Kaunas and Novi Sad.

==History==
The town was mentioned for the first time in 12 April 1128 in a message for Pope Honorius II.
For a long time Esch was a small farming village in the valley of the Uelzecht river. This changed when important amounts of iron ore were found in the area in the 1850s. With the development of the mines and the steel industry the town&#x27;s population multiplied tenfold in a couple of decades. In 1911 the steel- and iron-producing company ARBED was founded. The development of the steel industry, especially in the south of the country, provided Luxembourg with sustained economic growth during the second half of the 19th century.

In the 1970s, as a result of the steel crisis, the mines and many of the blast furnaces were shut down, the last one, in Esch-Belval, definitively halting its operations in 1997. The blast furnaces were replaced by an electric furnace that is fed with scrap metal rather than iron ore.

Today the industrial wastelands on Belval left behind by the steel industry, are being redeveloped and converted into a new, modern town quarter. New cultural buildings such as the cinema Kinepolis Belval in the Belval Plaza shopping mall and the Rockhal, Luxembourg&#x27;s biggest concert hall have been made.

The area around the old blast furnaces will host different structures of the University of Luxembourg, many research centres and the national archives.

==Government and politics==
===Local===

Esch is governed by its communal council, consisting of 19 councillors. Communal elections take place every 6 years, under a system of proportional representation. Currently the mayor is Christian Weis, of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV). The governing majority on the council consists of the CSV, the DP and The Greens.

==Demographics==
==Places of interest==
The Lankelz miniature railway operates on Sunday afternoons and public holidays from May to mid-October.

Esch is home to the Esch Conservatory of Music.

The city has the longest shopping street in Luxembourg.

In 2001, a Luxembourg film production company had depicted a 40,000 m2 and 15 meter high backdrop built for the feature film Secret Passage with John Turturro on the &quot;Terre Rouge&quot;, a site of a former steelwork in Esch-sur Alzette. The filmset represents the contemporary Venice of the 16th century with a 600 meter long copy of the Grand Canal and 118 house facades. The &quot;Venice-sur-Alzette&quot; was built for around 5 million Euro and was one of the largest open-air film sets in European film history.

Between 2001 and 2007 many film productions used the gigantic filmset. Among others the feature films &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Al Pacino and &quot;The Girl with the Pearl Earring&quot; with Scarlett Johansson were shot in Esch. In the summer of 2007, the filmset was torn down because the weather was affecting the buildings.

===European Capital of Culture for 2022===

<text>Teplice (, until 1948 Teplice-Šanov; , &quot;Teplitz-Schönau&quot;) is a city in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 51,000 inhabitants. It is the most populous Czech spa town, followed by Karlovy Vary. The historic city centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Teplice consists of seven municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Teplice (19,441)
*Hudcov (651)
*Nová Ves (1,315)
*Prosetice (3,359)
*Řetenice (4,016)
*Sobědruhy (1,144)
*Trnovany (18,502)
==Etymology==
&quot;Teplice&quot; is an Old Czech word meaning &#x27;warm (hot) water&#x27;.

==Geography==
Teplice is located about west of Ústí nad Labem and northwest of Prague. The northern part of the municipal territory lies in the Most Basin and the southern part lies in the Central Bohemian Uplands. The highest point is the hill Doubravská hora at above sea level. There are several small fishponds in the territory of Teplice.

==History==
According to the 1541 &quot;Annales Bohemorum&quot; by chronicler Wenceslaus Hajek, the thermal springs are fabled to have been discovered as early as 762; however, the first authentic mention of the baths occurred in the 16th century. The settlement of Trnovany was first documented in a 1057 deed, while Teplice proper was first mentioned in 1154, when Judith of Thuringia, queen consort of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, founded a Benedictine convent near the hot springs, the second in Bohemia. A fortified town arose around the monastery, which was destroyed in the course of the Hussite Wars after the 1426 Battle of Aussig. In the late 15th century, queen consort Joanna of Rožmitál, wife of King George of Poděbrady, had a castle erected on the ruins.

Teplice figures in the history of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when it was a possession of the Protestant Bohemian noble Vilém Kinský, who was assassinated together with Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein in Cheb in 1634. The Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II thereafter enfeoffed castle and town to his general Johann von Aldringen, who nevertheless was killed in battle in the same year, and Teplice fell to his sister Anna Maria von Clary-Aldringen. Consequently, and until 1945, Teplice Castle was the primarily seat of the princely House of Clary-Aldringen. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the devastated town was the destination of many German settlers.

After a blaze in 1793, large parts of the town were rebuilt in a Neoclassical style. The health resort was a popular venue for wealthy bourgeois like the poet Johann Gottfried Seume, who died on his stay in 1810, or Ludwig van Beethoven, who met here with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in 1812; as well as for European monarchs. During the Napoleonic War of the Sixth Coalition, Teplice in August 1813 was the site where Emperor Francis I of Austria, Emperor Alexander I of Russia and King Frederick William III of Prussia first signed the triple alliance against Napoleon I of France that led to the coalition victory at the nearby Battle of Kulm.

In 1895, Teplice merged with neighbouring Lázně Šanov (&quot;Schönau&quot;). Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary after World War I and the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the predominantly German-speaking population found itself in newly established Czechoslovakia. According to the 1930 census there were 30 799 people living in the city (5,232 persons of Czechoslovak ethnicity, 12 persons of Hungarian ethnicity, 23,127 persons of German ethnicity and 667 of Jewish ethnicity). Right-wing political groups like the German National Socialist Worker&#x27;s Party referred to themselves as &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; and began to urge for a unification with Germany, their efforts laid the foundation for the rise of the Sudeten German Party under Konrad Henlein after 1933. In 1938, Teplice was annexed by Nazi Germany according to the 1938 Munich Agreement and was administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. In 1930, 3,213 Jews lived in Teplice, 10% of the population. Under the Nazi regime they faced the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. Many fled and the Teplice Synagogue was burnt during Kristallnacht.
After World War II, the Czechoslovak government enacted the Beneš decrees, whereafter the German-speaking majority of the population was expelled from Teplice. In 1945, the Princes of Clary-Aldringen, lords of Teplice since 1634, were expropriated.

In 1994, Jaroslav Kubera of the ODS became mayor of Teplice and he held the position until 2018.

==Demographics==
==Economy==

The largest employers based in the city are AGC Flat Glass Czech (manufacturer of flat glass for the construction and automotive industries) and Severočeská servisní (a company that deals with construction and maintenance of pipelines), both with more than 1,000 employees.

===Spa===
One of the most important employers is the spa. The thermal mineral springs were mentioned already in 1154, which makes the spa the oldest in the country and Central Europe. The Pravřídlo spring reaches a temperature of 41 °C. The spa focuses on treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, nervous system diseases, and vascular diseases.

==Culture==

The city used to be nicknamed &quot;Little Paris&quot; and &quot;Salon of Europe&quot; for its spa architecture and cultural level until World War II, when it has been visited by prominent personalities including emperors, artists and other celebrities. The opening of the spa season is an annual three-day celebration with a rich cultural program.

The main venue for cultural events in the city is &quot;Dům kultury Teplice&quot; (&#x27;House of Culture Teplice&#x27;). It was built in 1981–1986. It includes a concert hall, a hall for dance activities, a cinema, and a puppet theatre.

The Krušnohorské Theatre is the city&#x27;s main venue for operas and plays. It was opened in 1924. The theatre had its own operetta troupe, but it ceased to exist in 1994, and since then only guest troupes have performed in the theatre.

Teplice is the home of the North Czech Philharmonic Teplice, which was founded in 1838. Performances regularly take place in the concert hall of the House of Culture Teplice.

==Sport==
Teplice is home to the professional football club FK Teplice playing in the Czech First League. The stadium &quot;Na Stínadlech&quot; is one of the largest in the country and has hosted international matches.

==Sights==

The main landmark is Teplice Castle. It houses a regional museum with historic castle interiors and a library. In the inner courtyard of the castle, there is a unique Romanesque exposition with the remains of Queen Judith and the remains of a Romanesque basilica with a rarely preserved Romanesque crypt. Adjoining the castle is a large castle garden.

The Church of Saint John the Baptist is a baroque building from 1594, rebuilt in 1703 to its current form. Its tower is open to the public and serves as a lookout tower.

The neo-Gothic Church of Saint Bartholomew was built in 1884 for German population of Lutheran faith. After their expulsion, the church changed owners several times and ceased to serve its purpose. Today it is conserved as a cultural monument and there are expositions concerning the history of the Jewish community in Teplice, and other.

Doubravka Castle is a castle ruin located in Trnovany part of Teplice. It was built in 1483 and conquered in 1639 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The castle began to serve as a destination for walks and in the 19th century, a restaurant and the neo-Gothic extension were built. Today there is a restaurant and a private lookout tower.

==Paleontology==
Fossils of an elasmosaurid plesiosaur (large carnivorous marine reptile from the Cretaceous period) were found near Teplice at the end of the 19th century. In the village of Hudcov (a part of Teplice), plesiosaur &quot;Cimoliasaurus teplicensis&quot; was described in 1906 by Czech paleontologist Antonín Frič.

<text>André Marie Chénier (; 30 October 176225 July 1794) was a French poet of Greek and Franco-Levantine origin, associated with the events of the French Revolution, during which he was sentenced to death. His sensual, emotive poetry marks him as one of the precursors of the Romantic movement. His career was brought to an abrupt end when he was guillotined for supposed &quot;crimes against the state&quot;. Chénier&#x27;s life has been the subject of Umberto Giordano&#x27;s opera &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; and other works of art.

==Life==

Chénier was born in the Galata district of Constantinople. His family home, destroyed in a fire, was located on the site of the present Saint Pierre Han, in today&#x27;s Karaköy neighborhood of Istanbul. His father, Louis Chénier, a native of Languedoc, after twenty years in the Levant as a cloth-merchant, was appointed to a position equivalent to that of French consul at Constantinople. His mother, Élisabeth Santi-Lomaca, whose sister was grandmother of Adolphe Thiers, was of Greek Cypriot origin. When André was three years old, his father returned to France, and from 1768 to 1775 served as consul-general of France in Morocco. The family, of which André was the third son, and Marie-Joseph (see below) the fourth, remained in France and for a few years André was given his youthful freedom while living with an aunt in Carcassonne. A square in Carcassonne is named to commemorate him. He distinguished himself as a verse-translator from the classics at the Collège de Navarre in Paris.

In 1783, Chénier enlisted in a French regiment at Strasbourg, but the novelty soon wore off. He returned to Paris before the end of the year, was well received by his family, and mixed in the cultivated circle which frequented his mother&#x27;s salon, including Lebrun-Pindare, Antoine Lavoisier, Jean François Lesueur, Claude Joseph Dorat, and, a little later, the painter Jacques-Louis David.

Chénier had already decided to become a poet, and worked in the neoclassical style of the time. He was especially inspired by a 1784 visit to Rome, Naples, and Pompeii. For nearly three years, he studied and experimented in verse without any pressure or interruption from his family. He wrote mostly idylls and bucolics, imitated to a large extent from Theocritus, Bion of Smyrna and the Greek anthologists. Among the poems written or at least sketched during this period were &quot;L&#x27;Oaristys&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Aveugle&quot;, &quot;La Jeune Malode&quot;, &quot;Bacchus&quot;, &quot;Euphrosine&quot; and &quot;La Jeune Tarentine&quot;. He mixed classical mythology with a sense of individual emotion and spirit.

Apart from his idylls and his elegies, Chénier also experimented with didactic and philosophic verse, and when he commenced his &quot;Hermès&quot; in 1783 his ambition was to condense the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Denis Diderot into a long poem somewhat after the manner of Lucretius. Now extant only in fragments, this poem was to treat of man&#x27;s place in the universe, first in an isolated state, and then in society. Another fragment called &quot;L&#x27;Invention&quot; sums up Chénier&#x27;s thoughts on poetry: &quot;De nouvelles pensées, faisons des vers antiques&quot; (&quot;From new thoughts, let us make antique verses&quot;).

Chénier remained unpublished. In November 1787, an opportunity for a fresh career presented itself. The Chevalier de la Luzerne, a friend of the Chénier family, had been appointed ambassador to Britain. When he offered to take André with him as his secretary, André knew the offer was too good to refuse, but was unhappy in England. He bitterly ridiculed &quot;... ces Anglais. Nation toute à vendre à qui peut la payer. De contrée en contrée allant au monde entier, Offrir sa joie ignoble et son faste grossier.&quot; Translation: &quot;... these English. A nation for sale to whoever can pay for it. Going from country to country and out to the whole world, offering its ignoble joy and its coarse splendor.&quot; Although John Milton and James Thomson seem to have interested him, and a few of his verses show slight inspiration from Shakespeare and Thomas Gray, it would be an exaggeration to say Chénier studied English literature.

The events of 1789, and the startling success of his younger brother, Marie-Joseph, as political playwright and pamphleteer, concentrated all his thoughts upon France. In April 1790 he could stand London no longer, and once more joined his parents at Paris in the rue de Cléry. France was on the verge of anarchy. A &quot;monarchien&quot; believing in a constitutional monarchy for France, Chénier believed that the Revolution was already complete and that all that remained to be done was the inauguration of the reign of law. Though his political viewpoint was moderate, his tactics were dangerously aggressive: he abandoned his gentle idyls to write poetical satires. His prose &quot;Avis au peuple français&quot; (24 August 1790) was followed by the rhetorical &quot;Jeu de paume&quot;, a somewhat declamatory moral ode occasioned by the Tennis court oath addressed to the radical painter Jacques-Louis David.

In the meantime Chénier orated at the Feuillants Club, and contributed frequently to the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; from November 1791 to July 1792, when he wrote his scorching iambs to Jean Marie Collot d&#x27;Herbois, &quot;Sur les Suisses révoltés du regiment de Châteauvieux&quot;. The insurrection of 10 August 1792 uprooted his party, his paper and his friends, and he only escaped the September Massacres by staying with relatives in Normandy. In the month following these events his brother, Marie-Joseph, had entered the anti-monarchical National Convention. André raged against all these events, in such poems as &quot;Ode à Charlotte Corday&quot; congratulating France that &quot;un scélérat de moins rampe dans cette fange&quot;, &quot;one scoundrel less creeps in this mire&quot;. At the request of Malesherbes, the defense counsel to King Louis XVI, Chénier provided some arguments for the king&#x27;s defense.

After the king&#x27;s execution, Chénier sought a secluded retreat on the Plateau de Satory at Versailles, and only went out after nightfall. There he wrote the poems inspired by Fanny (Mme Laurent Lecoulteux), including the exquisite &quot;Ode à Versailles&quot;. His solitary life at Versailles lasted nearly a year. On 7 March 1794 he was arrested at the house of Mme Pastoret at Passy. Two obscure agents of the Committee of Public Safety (one of them named Nicolas Guénot) were in search of a marquise who had fled, but an unknown stranger was found in the house and arrested on suspicion of being the aristocrat they were searching for. This was Chénier, who had come on a visit of sympathy.

Chénier was taken to the Luxembourg Palace and afterwards to the Prison Saint-Lazare. During the 140 days of his imprisonment he wrote a series of iambs (in alternate lines of 12 and 8 syllables) denouncing the Convention, which &quot;hiss and stab like poisoned bullets&quot;, and which were smuggled to his family by a jailer. In prison he also composed his most famous poem, &quot;Jeune captive&quot;, a poem at once of enchantment and of despair, inspired by the misfortunes of his fellow captive the duchesse de Fleury, née Aimée de Coigny. Ten days before Chénier&#x27;s death, the painter Joseph-Benoît Suvée completed the well-known portrait of him, shown in the box above. Aimée de Coigny survived the Terror, her freedom being bought by Casimir, Comte de Montrond on the same day that she was to follow Chénier to the guillotine.

Chénier might have been overlooked but for the well-meant, indignant officiousness of his father. Marie-Joseph tried, but failed, to prevent his brother&#x27;s execution. It is possible that the French government remembered Chénier as the author of the venomous verses in the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; and had him tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal for that reason.

Chénier was convicted by the Revolutionary Tribunal. At sundown, he was taken by tumbrel to the guillotine at what is now the Place de la Nation. He was executed along with Françoise-Thérèse de Choiseul-Stainville, Princesse Joseph de Monaco, on a charge of conspiracy. Robespierre was seized by the National Convention only two days later, and executed on July 28. Chénier, aged 31 at his execution, was buried in the Cimetière de Picpus.

==Works==
During Chénier&#x27;s lifetime only his &quot;Jeu de paume&quot; (1791) and &quot;Hymne sur les Suisses&quot; (1792) had been published. For the most part, then, his reputation rests on his posthumously published work, retrieved from oblivion page by page.

The &quot;Jeune Captive&quot; appeared in the &quot;Décade philosophique&quot;, on 9 January 1795; &quot;La Jeune Tarentine&quot; in the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; of 22 March 1801. François-René de Chateaubriand quoted three or four passages in his &quot;Génie du Christianisme&quot;. Fayolle and Jules Lefèvre-Deumier also gave a few fragments; but it was not until 1819 that an attempt was made by Henri de Latouche to collect the poems in a substantive volume, from manuscripts retained by Marie-Joseph Chénier. Many more poems and fragments were discovered after Latouche&#x27;s publication, and were collected in later editions. Latouche also wrote an account of Chénier&#x27;s last moments.

Critical opinions of Chénier have varied wildly. He experimented with classical precedents rendered in French verse to a much greater extent than other 18th-century poets; on the other hand, the ennui and melancholy of his poetry recalls Romanticism. In 1828, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve praised Chénier as a heroic forerunner of the Romantic movement and a precursor of Victor Hugo. Chénier, he said, had &quot;inspired and determined&quot; Romanticism. Many other critics also wrote about Chénier as modern and proto-Romantic. However, Anatole France contests Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s theory: he claims that Chénier&#x27;s poetry is one of the last expressions of 18th-century classicism. His work should not be compared to Hugo and the &quot;Parnassien&quot; poets, but to &quot;philosophes&quot; like André Morellet. Albert Camus in 1951&#x27;s The Rebel called Chenier &quot;the only poet of the times&quot;. Paul Morillot has argued that judged by the usual test of 1820s Romanticism (love for strange literature of the North, medievalism, novelties and experiments), Chénier would have been excluded from Romantic circles.

The poet José María de Heredia held Chénier in great esteem, saying &quot;I do not know in the French language a more exquisite fragment than the three hundred verses of the &quot;Bucoliques&quot;&quot; and agreeing with Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s judgment that Chénier was a poet ahead of his time. Chénier has been very popular in Russia, where Alexandr Pushkin wrote a poem about his last hours based on Latouche and Ivan Kozlov translated &quot;La Jeune Captive&quot;, &quot;La Jeune Tarentine&quot; and other famous pieces. Chénier has also found favor with English-speaking critics; for instance, his love of nature and of political freedom has been compared to Shelley, and his attraction to Greek art and myth recalls Keats.

Chénier&#x27;s fate has become the subject of many plays, pictures and poems, notably in the opera &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot; by Umberto Giordano, the epilogue by Sully-Prudhomme, the &quot;Stello&quot; by Alfred de Vigny, a poem by Pushkin, the delicate statue by Denys Puech in the Luxembourg, and the well-known portrait in the centre of Charles Louis Müller&#x27;s &quot;Last Days of the Terror&quot;.

<text>Dachau () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Fürstenfeldbruck, Aichach-Friedberg, Pfaffenhofen, Freising and Munich, and by the city of Munich.

== History ==
The district was established in 1952. There were slight changes to the territory in the administrative reform of 1972.

== Geography ==

The district extends from the northwestern suburbs of Munich to the so-called Dachauer Land. It is a hilly countryside, which is now densely populated. The growing Munich metropolitan area is advancing more and more into the district&#x27;s territory.

== Coat of arms ==
The arms include a red zigzag line on white background, which was the heraldic figure of the Wittelsbach family during the 12th and 13th century. Although it was not used anymore from the 14th century on, it is now part of the arms of Dachau in order to symbolise, that Dachau is an old part of the Bavarian state. In the upper part of the arms the blue and white checkered pattern of Bavaria is displayed.
