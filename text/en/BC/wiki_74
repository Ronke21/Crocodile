It is in the foothills of the Cordillera Central on the eastern edge of the Central Valley. The city, which was once named &quot;the cleanest city in Latin America,&quot;

== Geography ==
Grecia has an area of and an elevation of . It is in the foothills of the Cordillera Central on the eastern edge of the Central Valley. The city, which was once named &quot;the cleanest city in Latin America,&quot; is northwest of the provincial capital city of Alajuela, from Juan Santamaría International Airport, and from the national capital city of San José.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian Era ===
Grecia, and its neighboring districts, was previously inhabited by indigenous peoples belonging to the Western Huetar Kingdom. This presence occurred during the reign of King Garabito.

=== 19th Century ===
Grecia was petitioned to be founded as a town as early as October 1828. The first group of settlers, who later became bosses to future settlers, found the unestablished land to be very fertile. Furthermore, the state government motivated these travelers to discover pathways up North by offering them incentives. These discoveries and rewards led to an increase of migration of settlers into the northwest of the Central Valley, looking for unclaimed land to work on.

Eventually, the increase of settlements and construction of homes in the territory motivated residents to look for permission from the local government to officially establish the town. Their request, named File Number 21, was not approved until ten years later.

Legislation Number 69 was signed and enacted on April 27, 1838. The act allowed travelers to explore past the &quot;other side of the Poas&quot; and construct a settlement they would call Grecia.

==Economy==
Grecia is part of the tourist route of the western region of the Central Valley of Costa Rica, given the existence in the canton of waterfalls, protected areas, and the Catholic church of Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, which is part of Costa Rica&#x27;s historical-architectural heritage.

==Culture==
===Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes===
Grecia is noted for its unique church, , made entirely of pre-fabricated steel plates painted red. The building was constructed in the 19th century to represent the practice of Catholic religion in Grecia and honor the Virgin Mary.

Initially approved to be designed as a doric style brick temple, the Church of Our Lady of Mercy is built with neoclassical influence due to Angel Miguel Velasquez, secretary of public works at the time who introduced the design to the district.

There are several urban legends about this church. One recounts how the church was donated by some foreign country, and sent to Greece as a gift, but was wrongly shipped to Grecia, Costa Rica. Another legend states that the final destination of the church was the city of Punta Arenas in Chile but was disembarked, by mistake, in the port of Puntarenas, Costa Rica, and later sent to the city of Grecia, where it was assembled.

However, records clearly show that the instruction, shipment, and construction of the church were a coordinated effort of Grecia&#x27;s population, the Catholic Church, the Costa Rican government, and Alejo E. Jiménez Bonnefil (1858–1922), a Costa Rican coffee producer and exporter who was in charge of commanding and importing the church from the manufacturer in Belgium, in the late 19th century.

== Parks and recreation ==

=== Grecia Central Park ===

Located in front of Our Lady of Mercy Church, Grecia Central Park is one of the many parks in the district. The park has undergone numerous changes over the past few years, including the remodeling of its entire electrical system. The recreation ground is primarily used for walking. After numerous closures, however, the local government made an effort to promote the use of the space for its residents. The Vamos al Parque program, in collaboration with the University of Costa Rica, developed events such as free art, education, and recreation activities for its residents.

== Flora and fauna ==
A toucan named Grecia is the first toucan to receive a prosthetic beak. Its name is due to where the bird was found injured prior to its admission to the Rescate Wildlife Rescue Center (formerly Rescate Animal Zoo Ave), south of the city.

== Demographics ==

In June 2023, the population of Grecia was predicted to be 16,158—an 8% increase over 2011.

In the district, population is predicted to vary by age, with 21.4% at age 19 and under, 6.5% from 20 to 24, 35.7% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64 and 11.1% who were 65 or more.

== Government and politics ==

The local government of the district of Grecia is that of the Grecia canton—Grecia is a district in the Grecia canton. The municipality serves every district in the canton and its main responsibility is to administer local services and satisfy the interests of its residents. In 2020, Francisco Murillo Quesada, a lawyer, became the mayor of the Grecia canton. This also made him the mayor of the district of Grecia. He succeeded Minor Molina in May 2020. The first and second vice mayors of Grecia are Nora Maria Suarez Cruz and Francisco Rodriguez Gutierrez, respectively.

The district of Grecia is one of the seven districts that belong to the local government of the Grecia canton. The municipality consists of a popularly elected council, a trustee for each district, and a mayor. Currently, the trustee of the Grecia district is Luz María Jiménez Arrieta. She succeeded Roy José Rodríguez Corrales, who resigned in 2023.

== Transportation ==
=== Road transportation ===
The district is covered by the following road routes:
* National Route 107
* National Route 118
* National Route 154
* National Route 711

<doc id="251074" wikidata="Q1357659" url="?curid=251074" title="Raymond de Sèze">
<text>Raymond Romain, Comte de Sèze or Desèze (26 September 17502 May 1828) was a French advocate. Together with François Tronchet and Malesherbes, he defended Louis XVI, when the King was brought before the Convention for trial. De Sèze is remembered for a speech on Louis&#x27; behalf which impressed even his opponents.

==Life==
Raymond de Sèze was born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine, and studied in the famous law school of that city. He gained a reputation for remarkable passion and persuasiveness, and came to prominence in 1789 when he defended Pierre Victor, Baron de Besenval de Brunstatt, against the charge of the crime of lèse-nation.

When, at forty-four, he was called out of retirement to assist Louis XVI&#x27;s defence, he was considered one of the best lawyers in France. Though he had to prepare his defence arguments in a short amount of time, his brilliance shone through in a first draft that, although moving, Louis rejected as too rhetorical, saying, &quot;I do not want to play on their (the Convention&#x27;s) feelings&quot;. When the time for the real defence came, despite having had no sleep for over four days, de Sèze pleaded the King&#x27;s case for three hours, arguing eloquently yet discreetly that the Convention should spare his life. Beginning with a description of why the charges were invalid (under the terms of the constitution of 1791 Louis, as King, was immune from prosecution), he attacked the right of Convention to stand as judge and jury. Finally, he moved to a rejection of the charges in the &quot;acte enonciatif&quot; drawn up by the constitution charge by charge, with a royalist history of the revolution, portraying Louis as &#x27;the restorer of French Liberty&quot;. De Sèze finished, like many of the set-piece speeches of the revolution, with an appeal to history:
Jean-Paul Marat, the &quot;démagogue&quot; of the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, was favourably impressed, and declared: &quot;De Séze read a long speech made with a great deal of art&quot;. The Commune, the most violent of the factions at the time, described the speech as &quot;very adroit&quot;. Nevertheless, the case was lost, and the King was sent to the guillotine.

De Sèze himself was imprisoned during the revolution, but he managed to elude the scaffold. He was released after the fall of Robespierre, but he disappeared from public life, serving neither the Directory nor the Napoleonic government, both of which he saw as illegitimate. Upon the return of the Bourbons he was made a peer, as well as a judge and a member of the French Academy, before dying at the age of seventy eight.

<doc id="251075" wikidata="Q207450" url="?curid=251075" title="Induction motor">
<text>An induction motor or asynchronous motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor that produces torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding. An induction motor therefore needs no electrical connections to the rotor. An induction motor&#x27;s rotor can be either wound type or squirrel-cage type.

Three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors are widely used as industrial drives because they are self-starting, reliable, and economical. Single-phase induction motors are used extensively for smaller loads, such as garbage disposals and stationary power tools. Although traditionally used for constant-speed service, single- and three-phase induction motors are increasingly being installed in variable-speed applications using variable-frequency drives (VFD). VFD offers energy savings opportunities for induction motors in applications like fans, pumps, and compressors that have a variable load.

==History==
In 1824, the French physicist François Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields, termed Arago&#x27;s rotations. By manually turning switches on and off, Walter Baily demonstrated this in 1879, effectively the first primitive induction motor.

The first commutator-free single-phase AC induction motor was invented by Hungarian engineer Ottó Bláthy; he used the single-phase motor to propel his invention, the electricity meter.

The first AC commutator-free polyphase induction motors were independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla, a working motor model having been demonstrated by the former in 1885 and by the latter in 1887. Tesla applied for US patents in October and November 1887 and was granted some of these patents in May 1888. In April 1888, the &quot;Royal Academy of Science of Turin&quot; published Ferraris&#x27;s research on his AC polyphase motor detailing the foundations of motor operation. In May 1888 Tesla presented the technical paper &quot;A New System for Alternating Current Motors and Transformers&quot; to the &quot;American Institute of Electrical Engineers&quot; (AIEE) describing three four-stator-pole motor types: one having a four-pole rotor forming a non-self-starting reluctance motor, another with a wound rotor forming a self-starting induction motor, and the third a true synchronous motor with a separately excited DC supply to the rotor winding.

George Westinghouse, who was developing an alternating current power system at that time, licensed Tesla&#x27;s patents in 1888 and purchased a US patent option on Ferraris&#x27; induction motor concept. Tesla was also employed for one year as a consultant. Westinghouse employee C. F. Scott was assigned to assist Tesla and later took over development of the induction motor at Westinghouse. Steadfast in his promotion of three-phase development, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky invented the cage-rotor induction motor in 1889 and the three-limb transformer in 1890. Furthermore, he claimed that Tesla&#x27;s motor was not practical because of two-phase pulsations, which prompted him to persist in his three-phase work. Although Westinghouse achieved its first practical induction motor in 1892 and developed a line of polyphase 60 hertz induction motors in 1893, these early Westinghouse motors were two-phase motors with wound rotors until B. G. Lamme developed a rotating bar winding rotor.

The General Electric Company (GE) began developing three-phase induction motors in 1891. By 1896, General Electric and Westinghouse signed a cross-licensing agreement for the bar-winding-rotor design, later called the squirrel-cage rotor. Arthur E. Kennelly was the first to bring out the full significance of complex numbers (using &quot;j&quot; to represent the square root of minus one) to designate the 90º rotation operator in analysis of AC problems. GE&#x27;s Charles Proteus Steinmetz improved the application of AC complex quantities and developed an analytical model called the induction motor Steinmetz equivalent circuit.

Induction motor improvements flowing from these inventions and innovations were such that a modern 100-horsepower induction motor has the same mounting dimensions as a 7.5-horsepower motor in 1897.

==Principle ==

=== 3-phase motor ===
In both induction and synchronous motors, the AC power supplied to the motor&#x27;s stator creates a magnetic field that rotates in synchronism with the AC oscillations. Whereas a synchronous motor&#x27;s rotor turns at the same rate as the stator field, an induction motor&#x27;s rotor rotates at a somewhat slower speed than the stator field. The induction motor stator&#x27;s magnetic field is therefore changing or rotating relative to the rotor. This induces an opposing current in the rotor, in effect the motor&#x27;s secondary winding. The rotating magnetic flux induces currents in the rotor windings, in a manner similar to currents induced in a transformer&#x27;s secondary winding(s).

The induced currents in the rotor windings in turn create magnetic fields in the rotor that react against the stator field. The direction of the rotor magnetic field opposes the change in current through the rotor windings, following Lenz&#x27;s Law. The cause of induced current in the rotor windings is the rotating stator magnetic field, so to oppose the change in rotor-winding currents the rotor turns in the direction of the stator magnetic field. The rotor accelerates until the magnitude of induced rotor current and torque balances the load on the rotor. Since rotation at synchronous speed does not induce rotor current, an induction motor always operates slightly slower than synchronous speed. The difference, or &quot;slip,&quot; between actual and synchronous speed varies from about 0.5% to 5.0% for standard Design B torque curve induction motors. The induction motor&#x27;s essential character is that torque is created solely by induction instead of the rotor being separately excited as in synchronous or DC machines or being self-magnetized as in permanent magnet motors.

For rotor currents to be induced, the speed of the physical rotor must be lower than that of the stator&#x27;s rotating magnetic field (formula_1); otherwise the magnetic field would not be moving relative to the rotor conductors and no currents would be induced. As the speed of the rotor drops below synchronous speed, the rotation rate of the magnetic field in the rotor increases, inducing more current in the windings and creating more torque. The ratio between the rotation rate of the magnetic field induced in the rotor and the rotation rate of the stator&#x27;s rotating field is called &quot;slip&quot;. Under load, the speed drops and the slip increases enough to create sufficient torque to turn the load. For this reason, induction motors are sometimes referred to as &quot;asynchronous motors&quot;.

An induction motor can be used as an induction generator, or it can be unrolled to form a linear induction motor which can directly generate linear motion. The generating mode for induction motors is complicated by the need to excite the rotor, which begins with only residual magnetization. In some cases, that residual magnetization is enough to self-excite the motor under load. Therefore, it is necessary to either snap the motor and connect it momentarily to a live grid or to add capacitors charged initially by residual magnetism and providing the required reactive power during operation. Similar is the operation of the induction motor in parallel with a synchronous motor serving as a power factor compensator. A feature in the generator mode in parallel to the grid is that the rotor speed is higher than in the driving mode. Then active energy is being given to the grid. Another disadvantage of the induction motor generator is that it consumes a significant magnetizing current I0 = (20–35)%.

===Synchronous speed===
An AC motor&#x27;s synchronous speed, formula_2, is the rotation rate of the stator&#x27;s magnetic field,
: formula_3,

where formula_4 is the frequency of the power supply, formula_5 is the number of magnetic poles, and formula_2 is the synchronous speed of the machine. For formula_4 in hertz and formula_1 synchronous speed in RPM, the formula becomes:
: formula_9.

For example, for a four-pole, three-phase motor, formula_5 = 4 and formula_11 = 1,500 RPM (for formula_4 = 50 Hz) and 1,800 RPM (for formula_4 = 60 Hz) synchronous speed.

The number of magnetic poles, formula_5, is the number of north and south poles per phase. For example; a single-phase motor with 3 north and 3 south poles, having 6 poles per phase, is a 6-pole motor. A three-phase motor with 18 north and 18 south poles, having 6 poles per phase, is also a 6-pole motor. This industry standard method of counting poles results in the same synchronous speed for a given frequency regardless of polarity.

===Slip===

Slip, formula_15, is defined as the difference between synchronous speed and operating speed, at the same frequency, expressed in rpm, or in percentage or ratio of synchronous speed. Thus

:formula_16
where
formula_1 is stator electrical speed, formula_18 is rotor mechanical speed. Slip, which varies from zero at synchronous speed and 1 when the rotor is stalled, determines the motor&#x27;s torque. Since the short-circuited rotor windings have small resistance, even a small slip induces a large current in the rotor and produces significant torque. At full rated load, slip varies from more than 5% for small or special purpose motors to less than 1% for large motors. These speed variations can cause load-sharing problems when differently sized motors are mechanically connected. Various methods are available to reduce slip, VFDs often offering the best solution.

===Torque===
====Standard torque====

The typical speed-torque relationship of a standard NEMA Design B polyphase induction motor is as shown in the curve at right. Suitable for most low performance loads such as centrifugal pumps and fans, Design B motors are constrained by the following typical torque ranges:
* &quot;Breakdown torque&quot; (peak torque), 175–300% of rated torque
* &quot;Locked-rotor torque&quot; (torque at 100% slip), 75–275% of rated torque
* Pull-up torque, 65–190% of rated torque.

Over a motor&#x27;s normal load range, the torque&#x27;s slope is approximately linear or proportional to slip because the value of rotor resistance divided by slip, formula_19, dominates torque in a linear manner. As load increases above rated load, stator and rotor leakage reactance factors gradually become more significant in relation to formula_19 such that torque gradually curves towards breakdown torque. As the load torque increases beyond breakdown torque the motor stalls.

====Starting====

There are three basic types of small induction motors: split-phase single-phase, shaded-pole single-phase, and polyphase.

In two-pole single-phase motors, the torque goes to zero at 100% slip (zero speed), so these require alterations to the stator such as shaded-poles to provide starting torque. A single phase induction motor requires separate starting circuitry to provide a rotating field to the motor. The normal running windings within such a single-phase motor can cause the rotor to turn in either direction, so the starting circuit determines the operating direction.

In certain smaller single-phase motors, starting is done by means of a copper wire turn around part of a pole; such a pole is referred to as a shaded pole. The current induced in this turn lags behind the supply current, creating a delayed magnetic field around the shaded part of the pole face. This imparts sufficient rotational field energy to start the motor. These motors are typically used in applications such as desk fans and record players, as the required starting torque is low, and the low efficiency is tolerable relative to the reduced cost of the motor and starting method compared to other AC motor designs.

Larger single phase motors are split-phase motors and have a second stator winding fed with out-of-phase current; such currents may be created by feeding the winding through a capacitor or having it receive different values of inductance and resistance from the main winding. In &quot;capacitor-start&quot; designs, the second winding is disconnected once the motor is up to speed, usually either by a centrifugal switch acting on weights on the motor shaft or a thermistor which heats up and increases its resistance, reducing the current through the second winding to an insignificant level. The &quot;capacitor-run&quot; designs keep the second winding on when running, improving torque. A &quot;resistance start&quot; design uses a starter inserted in series with the startup winding, creating reactance.

Self-starting polyphase induction motors produce torque even at standstill. Available squirrel-cage induction motor starting methods include direct-on-line starting, reduced-voltage reactor or auto-transformer starting, star-delta starting or, increasingly, new solid-state soft assemblies and, of course, variable frequency drives (VFDs).

Polyphase motors have rotor bars shaped to give different speed-torque characteristics. The current distribution within the rotor bars varies depending on the frequency of the induced current. At standstill, the rotor current is the same frequency as the stator current, and tends to travel at the outermost parts of the cage rotor bars (by skin effect). The different bar shapes can give usefully different speed-torque characteristics as well as some control over the inrush current at startup.

Although polyphase motors are inherently self-starting, their starting and pull-up torque design limits must be high enough to overcome actual load conditions.

In wound rotor motors, rotor circuit connection through slip rings to external resistances allows change of speed-torque characteristics for acceleration control and speed control purposes.

====Speed control====
=====Resistance=====

Before the development of semiconductor power electronics, it was difficult to vary the frequency, and cage induction motors were mainly used in fixed speed applications. Applications, such as electric overhead cranes, used DC drives or wound rotor motors (WRIM) with slip rings for rotor circuit connection to variable external resistance allowing considerable range of speed control. However, resistor losses associated with low speed operation of WRIMs is a major cost disadvantage, especially for constant loads. Large slip ring motor drives, termed slip energy recovery systems, some still in use, recover energy from the rotor circuit, rectify it, and return it to the power system using a VFD.

=====Cascade=====
The speed of a pair of slip-ring motors can be controlled by a cascade connection, or concatenation. The rotor of one motor is connected to the stator of the other. If the two motors are also mechanically connected, they will run at half speed. This system was once widely used in three-phase AC railway locomotives, such as FS Class E.333. By the turn of this century, however, such cascade-based electromechanical systems became much more efficiently and economically solved using power semiconductor elements solutions.

=====Variable-frequency drive=====

In many industrial variable-speed applications, DC and WRIM drives are being displaced by VFD-fed cage induction motors. The most common efficient way to control asynchronous motor speed of many loads is with VFDs. Barriers to adoption of VFDs due to cost and reliability considerations have been reduced considerably over the past three decades such that it is estimated that drive technology is adopted in as many as 30–40% of all newly installed motors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motoring Ahead 1/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Variable frequency drives implement the scalar or vector control of an induction motor.

With scalar control, only the magnitude and frequency of the supply voltage are controlled without phase control (absent feedback by rotor position). Scalar control is suitable for application where the load is constant.

Vector control allows independent control of the speed and torque of the motor, making it possible to maintain a constant rotation speed at varying load torque. But vector control is more expensive because of the cost of the sensor (not always) and the requirement for a more powerful controller.

==Construction==

The stator of an induction motor consists of poles carrying supply current to induce a magnetic field that penetrates the rotor. To optimize the distribution of the magnetic field, windings are distributed in slots around the stator, with the magnetic field having the same number of north and south poles. Induction motors are most commonly run on single-phase or three-phase power, but two-phase motors exist; in theory, induction motors can have any number of phases. Many single-phase motors having two windings can be viewed as two-phase motors, since a capacitor is used to generate a second power phase 90° from the single-phase supply and feeds it to the second motor winding. Single-phase motors require some mechanism to produce a rotating field on startup. Induction motors using a squirrel-cage rotor winding may have the rotor bars skewed slightly to smooth out torque in each revolution.

Standardized NEMA &amp; IEC motor frame sizes throughout the industry result in interchangeable dimensions for shaft, foot mounting, general aspects as well as certain motor flange aspect. Since an open, drip proof (ODP) motor design allows a free air exchange from outside to the inner stator windings, this style of motor tends to be slightly more efficient because the windings are cooler. At a given power rating, lower speed requires a larger frame.

==Rotation reversal==
The method of changing the direction of rotation of an induction motor depends on whether it is a three-phase or single-phase machine. A three-phase motor can be reversed by swapping any two of its phase connections. Motors required to change direction regularly (such as hoists) will have extra switching contacts in their controller to reverse rotation as needed. A variable frequency drive nearly always permits reversal by electronically changing the phase sequence of voltage applied to the motor.

In a single-phase split-phase motor, reversal is achieved by reversing the connections of the starting winding. Some motors bring out the start winding connections to allow selection of rotation direction at installation. If the start winding is permanently connected within the motor, it is impractical to reverse the sense of rotation. Single-phase shaded-pole motors have a fixed rotation unless a second set of shading windings is provided.

==Power factor==
The power factor of induction motors varies with load, typically from about 0.85 or 0.90 at full load to as low as about 0.20 at no-load, due to stator and rotor leakage and magnetizing reactances. Power factor can be improved by connecting capacitors either on an individual motor basis or, by preference, on a common bus covering several motors. For economic and other considerations, power systems are rarely power factor corrected to unity power factor.
Power capacitor application with harmonic currents requires power system analysis to avoid harmonic resonance between capacitors and transformer and circuit reactances. Common bus power factor correction is recommended to minimize resonant risk and to simplify power system analysis.

==Efficiency==

Full-load motor efficiency ranges from 85–97%, with losses as follows:
* Friction and windage, 5–15%
* Iron or core losses, 15–25%
* Stator losses, 25–40%
* Rotor losses, 15–25%
* Stray load losses, 10–20%.

For an electric motor, the efficiency, represented by the Greek letter Eta, is defined as the quotient of the mechanical output power and the electric input power, calculated using this formula:

: formula_21

Regulatory authorities in many countries have implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency electric motors. Some legislation mandates the future use of premium-efficiency induction motors in certain equipment. &quot;For more information, see: Premium efficiency.&quot;

==Steinmetz equivalent circuit==
Many useful motor relationships between time, current, voltage, speed, power factor, and torque can be obtained from analysis of the Steinmetz equivalent circuit (also termed T-equivalent circuit or IEEE recommended equivalent circuit), a mathematical model used to describe how an induction motor&#x27;s electrical input is transformed into useful mechanical energy output. The equivalent circuit is a single-phase representation of a multiphase induction motor that is valid in steady-state balanced-load conditions.

The Steinmetz equivalent circuit is expressed simply in terms of the following components:
* Stator resistance and leakage reactance (formula_22, formula_23).
* Rotor resistance, leakage reactance, and slip (formula_24, formula_25 or formula_26, formula_27, and formula_15).
* Magnetizing reactance (formula_29).

Paraphrasing from Alger in Knowlton, an induction motor is simply an electrical transformer the magnetic circuit of which is separated by an air gap between the stator winding and the moving rotor winding. The equivalent circuit can accordingly be shown either with equivalent circuit components of respective windings separated by an ideal transformer or with rotor components referred to the stator side as shown in the following circuit and associated equation and parameter definition tables.

The following rule-of-thumb approximations apply to the circuit:
* Maximum current happens under locked rotor current (LRC) conditions and is somewhat less than formula_30, with LRC typically ranging between 6 and 7 times rated current for standard Design B motors.
* Breakdown torque formula_31 happens when formula_32 and formula_33 such that formula_34 and thus, with constant voltage input, a low-slip induction motor&#x27;s percent-rated maximum torque is about half its percent-rated LRC.
* The relative stator to rotor leakage reactance of standard Design B cage induction motors is
*: formula_35.
* Neglecting stator resistance, an induction motor&#x27;s torque curve reduces to the Kloss equation
*: formula_36, where formula_37 is slip at formula_31.

==Linear induction motor==

Linear induction motors, which work on the same general principles as rotary induction motors (frequently three-phase), are designed to produce straight line motion. Uses include magnetic levitation, linear propulsion, linear actuators, and liquid metal pumping.

<doc id="251076" wikidata="Q334614" url="?curid=251076" title="Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton">
<text>Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton, FRS (19 June 1809 – 11 August 1885) was an English poet, patron of literature and a politician who strongly supported social justice.

==Background and education==
Milnes was born in London, the son of Robert Pemberton Milnes, of Fryston Hall, Castleford, West Yorkshire, and the Honourable Henrietta, daughter of Robert Monckton-Arundell, 4th Viscount Galway. His grandmother was Rachel Slater Milnes (née Busk, 1760–1835), niece of Sir Wadsworth Busk. Milnes was educated privately, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827. There he was drawn into a literary set, and became a member of the famous Apostles Club, which then included Alfred Lord Tennyson, Arthur Hallam, Richard Chenevix Trench, Joseph Williams Blakesley, and others. After graduating with an M.A. in 1831, Milnes travelled abroad, spending some time at the University of Bonn.

He went to Italy and Greece, and published in 1834 a volume of &quot;Memorials of a Tour in some Parts of Greece&quot;, describing his experiences.

==Political career==
Milnes returned to London in 1837, and was elected to Parliament as a member for Pontefract as a Conservative. In parliament, he interested himself particularly in the question of copyright and the conditions of reformatory schools. He left Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s party over the Corn Law controversy, and was afterwards identified in politics with Lord Palmerston. His easy good nature had the effect that his political career was viewed with less seriousness by his contemporaries than it might otherwise have been. In 1848, he went to Paris to see something of the revolution, and to fraternise with both sides. On his return he wrote, as a ‘Letter to Lord Lansdowne,&#x27; 1848, a pamphlet on the events of that year, in which he offended the conservatives by his sympathy with continental liberalism, and in particular with the struggle of Italy against Austria. During the Chartist riots of 1848, Matthew Arnold wrote to his mother:Tell Miss Martineau it is said here that Monckton Milnes refused to be sworn in a special constable, that he might be free to assume the post of President of the Republic at a moment&#x27;s notice.

Milnes shared similar interests and concerns - such as female education and slavery in the United States - with his relative Harriet Martineau whose niece, educationalist Frances Lupton, was the sister-in-law of Anna Jane Lupton (née Busk), a second cousin of Milnes&#x27; father. Frances&#x27;s second cousin was local politician Philip Meadows Martineau (1831-1911) who joined Milnes as a member of the Early English Text Society as did her son, Francis Martineau Lupton, also a local politician and Lord Tennyson. 

In 1863, Palmerston elevated Milnes to the peerage as Baron Houghton, of Great Houghton in the West Riding of the County of York.

George W. E. Russell said of him: &quot;As years advanced he became not (as the manner of most men is) less Liberal, but more so; keener in sympathy with all popular causes; livelier in his indignation against monopoly and injustice.&quot;

==Literary career and interests==

Milnes&#x27; literary career was often influenced by church matters. He wrote a tract in 1841, which was praised by John Henry Newman. He took part in the discussion about &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot;, defending the tractarian position in &quot;One Tract More&quot; (1841). He published two volumes of verse in 1838, &quot;Memorials of Residence upon the Continent&quot; and &quot;Poems of Many Years&quot;, &quot;Poetry for the People&quot; in 1840 and &quot;Palm Leaves&quot; in 1844. He also wrote a &quot;Life and Letters of Keats&quot; in 1848, the material for which was largely provided by the poet&#x27;s friend, Charles Armitage Brown. Milnes&#x27; ballads were among the most popular of their day. In 1868, Lord Houghton was elected to the Royal Society. In 1870, he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

Despite his piety, he had apparently an almost unsurpassed collection of erotic literature, which he bequeathed to the British Library, a collection known to few in his lifetime. A man whom his biographer Saunders said, &quot;had many fine tastes and some coarse ones&quot;, Milnes authored &quot;The Rodiad&quot;, a pornographic poem on the subject of flagellation.

However, his chief distinctions were his sense of literary merit in others and the way he fostered it. He was surrounded by the most brilliant men of his time, many of whom he had been the first to acclaim. His reputation rests largely on the part he played, as a man of influence in society and in moulding public opinion on literary matters, in connection with his large circle of talented friends. He secured a pension for Tennyson and, as an abolitionist, helped to make Ralph Waldo Emerson known in Britain. He was one of the earliest champions of Algernon Charles Swinburne and helped David Gray by writing a preface for &quot;The Luggie&quot;. He helped to obtain a job for Coventry Patmore at the British Museum. He was, in the traditional sense, a patron of literature, who never abused the privileges of his position.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
He admired the literacy brilliance in female writers and was a firm friend of the Gaskell family of Manchester. A champion of women&#x27;s rights, in 1871 he served as a vice-president on the Leeds Committee of the National Association for the Promotion of Social Science and was president of the association in 1873. He supported Meta, the daughter of novelist Elizabeth Gaskell in her work as the Representative of the Manchester Ladies&#x27; Educational Association and on The North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women. The Spectator reported upon Meta&#x27;s death in 1913 that, &quot;Lord Houghton once said that the conversation and society to be met with in the house of the Gaskells at Manchester – Plymouth Grove – were the one thing which made life in that city tolerable for people of literary tastes&quot;.

==Personal life==
Milnes was a persistent suitor of Florence Nightingale (who finally refused to marry him), and one of her staunchest supporters along with the statesman Sidney Herbert. On 30 July 1851, he married the Honourable Annabella Hungerford Crewe, daughter of John Crewe, 2nd Baron Crewe. Together they had three children:

* Hon. Amicia Henrietta Milnes (d. 4 Jul 1902). She married Sir Gerald FitzGerald. They had one known son, archaeologist Capt. Gerald Milnes FitzGerald (b. 5 October 1883).
* Hon. Florence Ellen Hungerford Milnes (d. 4 Apr 1923). She married Maj.-Gen. Arthur Henry Henniker-Major, son of John Henniker-Major, 4th Baron Henniker. They had no issue.
* Lord Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st and last Marquess of Crewe (12 Jan 1858 – 20 Jun 1945)

She died in 1874. Lord Houghton died at Vichy, France, in August 1885, aged 76, and was buried at Fryston. He was succeeded in the barony by his son, Robert, who became a prominent Liberal statesman and was created Earl of Crewe in 1895 and Marquess of Crewe in 1911.

Richard and Annabella&#x27;s two daughters were Amicia Henrietta and the novelist Florence Henniker.

Milnes took an interest in parapsychology and was a member of the Society for Psychical Research.

<text>Asha Bhosle (; ; born 8 September 1933) is an Indian playback singer, entrepreneur, actress and television personality who predominantly works in Indian cinema. Known for her versatility, she has been described in the media as one of the greatest and most influential singers in Hindi cinema. In her career spanning over eight decades she has recorded songs for films and albums in various Indian languages and received several accolades including two National Film Awards, four BFJA Awards, eighteen Maharashtra State Film Awards, nine Filmfare Awards including a Lifetime Achievement Award and a record seven Filmfare Awards for Best Female Playback Singer, in addition to two Grammy nominations. In 2000, she was honoured with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India&#x27;s highest award in the field of cinema. In 2008, she was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian honour of the country. The Guinness Book of World Records acknowledged her in 2011 as the most recorded artist in music history.

Bhosle is the sister of playback singer Lata Mangeshkar and belongs to the prominent Mangeshkar family. Renowned for her soprano voice range and often credited for her versatility, Her work includes film music, pop, ghazals, bhajans, traditional Indian classical music, folk songs, qawwalis, and Rabindra Sangeet. Apart from Hindi, she has sung in over 20 Indian and foreign languages. In 2013, she made her debut as an actress in the film &quot;Mai&quot;, and received critical acclaim for her performance. In 2006, she stated that she has recorded over twelve thousand songs in her career, a figure repeated by several other sources.

==Early life and career==
Asha Mangeshkar was born in the small hamlet of Goar in Sangli, then in the salute princely state of Sangli (now in Maharashtra), into the musical family of Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar, who was Marathi and Konkani, and his Gujarati wife, Shevanti. Deenanath was an actor and classical singer on the Marathi musical stage. When Bhosle was nine years old, her father died. The family moved from Pune to Kolhapur and then to Mumbai. She and her elder sister Lata Mangeshkar began singing and acting in films to support their family. She sang her first film song &#x27;&quot;Chala Chala Nav Bala&quot; for the Marathi film &quot;Majha Bal&quot; (1943). The music for the film was composed by Datta Davjekar. She made her Hindi film debut when she sang the song &quot;Saawan Aaya&quot; for Hansraj Behl&#x27;s &quot;Chunariya&quot; (1948), though another film &quot;Andhon Ki Duniya&quot; was released before &quot;Chunariya&quot; in the same year, in both films she has sung one trio each. Her first solo Hindi film song was for the movie &quot;Raat Ki Rani&quot; (1949).

At the age of 16, she eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle, marrying him against her family&#x27;s wishes.

==Career==

In the late 1940s to early 1950s, prominent playback singers like Geeta Dutt, Shamshad Begum and Lata Mangeshkar dominated the singing for the female lead and the big films. In the 1950s, Bhosle sang more songs than most playback singers in Hindi films. Most of these were in low budget films. Her earliest songs were composed by A. R. Qureshi, Sajjad Hussain, S. Mohinder, Sardar Malik, Ghulam Mohammed and some others. Singing in &quot;Sangdil&quot; (1952), composed by Sajjad Hussain, she got reasonable recognition. In the same year, she has lead in the film &quot;Chham Chhama Chham&quot;, under O. P. Nayyar, she has sung 10 out of 11 songs in that film. Consequently, film director Bimal Roy gave her a chance to sing in &quot;Parineeta&quot; (1953). Raj Kapoor signed her to sing all songs in &quot;Boot Polish&quot; (1954), which gained her popularity.

O. P. Nayyar gave Bhosle a number of songs during 1952-1956, although she first achieved success in B. R. Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957), composed by him. Her duets with Rafi like &quot;Maang Ke Saath Tumhara&quot;, &quot;Saathi Haath Badhana&quot; and &quot;Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri&quot;, penned by Sahir Ludhianvi, earned her recognition. It was the first time she sang all the songs for a film&#x27;s leading actress. B. R. Chopra then approached her for several of his later productions, including &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot;, &quot;Gumrah&quot; (1963), &quot;Waqt&quot; (1965), &quot;Hamraaz&quot; (1967), &quot;Aadmi Aur Insaan&quot; (1969), &quot;Dhund&quot; (1973) and many more. O. P. Nayyar&#x27;s future collaboration with Bhosle also resulted in success. Gradually, she established her status and received the patronage of such composers as Sachin Dev Burman and Ravi. Bhosle and O. P. Nayyar had a professional and personal parting of ways in the 1970s.
In 1966, Bhosle&#x27;s performances in the duets from one of music director R.D. Burman&#x27;s soundtracks, for the movie &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot;, won popular acclaim. Reportedly, when she first heard the dance number &quot;Aaja Aaja&quot;, she felt she would not be able to sing this westernised tune. While Burman offered to change the music, she refused, taking it as a challenge. She completed the song after ten days of rehearsals, and &quot;Aaja Aaja&quot;, along with such other songs as &quot;O Haseena Zulfonwali&quot; and &quot;O Mere Sona Re&quot; (all three duets with Rafi), became successful. Shammi Kapoor, the film&#x27;s leading actor, was once quoted as saying– &quot;If I did not have Mohammad Rafi to sing for me, I would have got Asha Bhosle to do the job&quot;. Bhosle&#x27;s collaboration with Burman resulted in numerous hits and a marriage. During the 1960-70s, she was the voice of Hind film actress and dancer, Helen, on whom &quot;O Haseena Zulfon Wali&quot; was picturised. It is said that Helen would attend her recording sessions so that she could understand the song better and plan dance steps accordingly. Some of their other popular numbers include &quot;Piya Tu Ab To Aaja&quot; (&quot;Caravan&quot;) and &quot;Yeh Mera Dil&quot; (&quot;Don&quot;), among others.

In 1981, Bhosle attempted a different genre by singing several ghazals for the Rekha-starrer &quot;Umrao Jaan&quot;, including &quot;Dil Cheez Kya Hai&quot;, &quot;In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke&quot;, &quot;Yeh Kya Jagah Hai Doston&quot; and &quot;Justju Jiski Thi&quot;. The film&#x27;s music director Khayyam, had lowered her pitch by half a note. Bhosle herself expressed surprise that she could sing so differently. The ghazals won her the first National Film Award of her career. A few years later, she won another National Award for the song &quot;Mera Kuchh Saamaan&quot; from &quot;Ijaazat&quot; (1987).

In 1995, 62-year-old Bhosle sang for actress Urmila Matondkar in the movie &quot;Rangeela&quot;. The soundtrack featured songs like &quot;Tanha Tanha&quot; and &quot;Rangeela Re&quot; sung by her, and composed by music director A. R. Rahman, who would go on to record several songs with her. During the 2000s, several of Bhosle&#x27;s numbers became chartbusters, including &quot;Radha Kaise Na Jale&quot; from &quot;Lagaan&quot; (2001), &quot;Kambakht Ishq&quot; from &quot;Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya&quot; (2001), &quot;Yeh Lamha&quot; from &quot;Filhaal&quot; (2002) and &quot;Lucky Lips&quot; from &quot;&quot; (2005). In October 2004, &quot;The Very Best of Asha Bhosle, The Queen of Bollywood&quot;, a compilation album of songs recorded by Bhosle for albums and Hindi language films that were released between 1966 and 2003, was released.

In 2012 she judged Sur Kshetra.

In 2013, Bhosle debuted in the film &quot;Mai&quot; in the title role, at the age of 79. Bhosle played the role of a 65-year-old mother who suffers from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and is abandoned by her children. She received positive reviews for her acting as well from critics.

In May 2020, Bhosle launched her YouTube channel named &quot;Asha Bhosle Official&quot;.

==Partnership with music directors==

===O. P. Nayyar===

Music director O. P. Nayyar&#x27;s association with Bhosle is part of Hindi film lore. He was the composer who first gave Bhosle her own identity. Many people have speculated about a romantic relationship between the two.

Nayyar first met Bhosle in 1952, at the music recording of &quot;Chham Chhama Chham&quot;. He then called her for a film called &quot;Mangu&quot; (1954), and gave her a big break in superhit films like &quot;Baap Re Baap&quot; (1955), &quot;Ham Sab Chor Hain&quot; (1956), &quot;C.I.D.&quot; (1956), Duniya Rang Rangeeli (1957), Mr. Qartoon M. A. (1958) and many more. However, it was the success of Naya Daur (1957) that made the duo popular. After 1959, she was emotionally and professionally involved with O. P. Nayyar.

The team of O. P. Nayyar and Bhosle is best remembered for their breezy and sometimes sirenish songs. Some good examples of their sensuous numbers are &quot;Aaiye Meharbaan&quot; picturised on Madhubala (&quot;Howrah Bridge&quot;, 1958) and &quot;Yeh Hai Reshmi Zulfon Ka Andhera&quot;, (&quot;Mere Sanam&quot;, 1965). &quot;Aao Huzoor Tumko&quot; (&quot;Kismat&quot;, 1968) and &quot;Jaiye Aap Kahan Jayenge&quot; (&quot;Mere Sanam&quot;, 1965) were also popular. They also recorded songs for many hit movies like &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha&quot; (1957), &quot;Ek Musafir Ek Hasina&quot; (1962) and &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot; (1964). O. P. Nayyar used the Bhosle-Rafi duo for his most popular duets such as &quot;Mangke Saath Tumhara&quot;, &quot;Uden Jab Jab Zulfein Teri&quot; (both from &quot;Naya Daur&quot;), &quot;Aap Yun Hi Agar Humse Milte Rahe&quot;, &quot;Main Pyaar Ka Rahi Hoon&quot; (both from &quot;Ek Musafir Ek Hasina&quot;), &quot;Deewana Hua Baadal&quot;, &quot;Ishaaron Ishaaron Mein&quot; (both from &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot;).

Bhosle recorded her last song for O. P. Nayyar in the movie &quot;Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye&quot; (1974). The solo number &quot;Chain Se Humko Kabhi&quot; garnered many awards, but it was not included in the movie.

They separated on 5 August 1972. It is not clear what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O. P. Nayyar once said, &quot;I know astrology very well. I knew that one day I had to part with her. Something also happened that upset me, so I left her.&quot; Nevertheless, he also said &quot;...now that I am seventy-six, I can say that the most important person in my life was Asha Bhosle. She was the best person I ever met.&quot;

The parting of Bhosle and O. P. Nayyar was bitter, and probably therefore she has hesitated to give Nayyar his due. While talking about O. P. Nayyar in an interview with The Times of India, she once remarked, &quot;Whichever composer gave me work, it was because my voice was suited to his music at that point. No &quot;one&quot; musician did me any favor by asking me to sing for him.&quot; She gives the credit for her first big break to B. R. Chopra, the producer of &quot;Naya Daur&quot;.

===Khayyam===
Another music director who recognized Bhosle&#x27;s talent early was Khayyam. Their partnership dates back to his first movie &quot;Biwi&quot; (1948), in which Khayyam was assistant music director. Khayyam gave her some good assignments in the 1950s, including &quot;Footpath&quot; and &quot;Phir Subah Hogi&quot;. However, their collaboration is chiefly remembered for the songs of &quot;Umrao Jaan&quot;.

===Ravi===
Music composer Ravi considered Bhosle one of his favorite singers. She sang for his first movie &quot;Vachan&quot; (1955). The melodious lullaby from this movie, &quot;Chanda Mama Door Ke&quot; became an overnight hit among young mothers in India. Ravi got her to sing bhajans for the movies &quot;Gharana&quot;, &quot;Grahasti&quot;, &quot;Kaajal&quot; and &quot;Phool Aur Patthar&quot;, Ravi and Bhosle recorded a variety of songs, including the popular comic duet with Kishore Kumar :– &quot;C A T...Cat, Cat Maane Billi&quot; (&quot;Dilli Ka Thug&quot;). The bhajan &quot;Tora Man Darpan Kehlaye&quot; (&quot;Kaajal&quot;) attained great popularity.

They also recorded songs for many popular movies like &quot;Waqt&quot;, &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot;, &quot;Gumrah&quot;, &quot;Bahu Beti&quot;, &quot;China Town&quot;, &quot;Aadmi Aur Insaan&quot;, &quot;Dhund&quot;, &quot;Hamraaz&quot; and many more. For &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot;, Ravi wanted Geeta Dutt (the wife of actor and producer Guru Dutt) to sing the songs. Guru Dutt insisted that only Bhosle could do justice with those songs, which has been proved.

===Sachin Dev Burman===
Sachin Dev Burman was one of those composers, who had recognized the potentiality and versatility in Bhosle and apart from Lata Mangeshkar, he had utilised the voice of Bhosle as well, he had some misunderstandings with Lata from 1957 to 1962, on that time only Bhosle used to be his only female voice. She and Burman Dada gave many songs in movies such as &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot;, &quot;Kala Pani&quot;, &quot;Kala Bazar&quot;, &quot;Insan Jaag Utha&quot;, &quot;Lajwanti&quot;, &quot;Sujata&quot;, &quot;Teen Devian&quot; and many more. They recorded many songs together after 1962 as well.

===Rahul Dev Burman (Pancham)===

Bhosle first met Rahul Dev Burman (also known as Pancham) when she was the mother of two and he was in 10th grade having dropped out to pursue music. Their partnership was first noticed in &quot;Teesri Manzil&quot; (1966). She went on to record a variety of songs with him – cabarets, rock, disco, ghazals and classical.

In the 1970s, Bhosle and Burman&#x27;s youthful Western songs took Hindi film music by storm – the raunchy cabaret &quot;Piya Tu Ab To Aaja&quot; (&quot;Caravan&quot;, picturized on Helen), the rebellious &quot;Dum Maro Dum&quot; (&quot;Hare Rama Hare Krishna&quot;, 1971), the sexy &quot;Duniya Mein Logon Ko&quot; (&quot;Apna Desh&quot;, 1972) and the romantic &quot;Chura Liya Hai Tumne&quot; (&quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot;, 1973). Burman also recorded many hit duets with Bhosle and Kishore Kumar such as &quot;Jaan-E-Jaan Dhundhta Phir Raha&quot; (&quot;Jawani Diwani&quot;) and &quot;Bhali Bhali Si Ek Soorat&quot; (&quot;Buddha Mil Gaya&quot;).

In the 1980s, Burman and Bhosle recorded subtle numbers for films like &quot;Ijaazat&quot; (1987) - &quot;Mera Kuch Saaman&quot;, &quot;Khaali Haath Shaam Aayi Hai&quot; and &quot;Katra Katra&quot;. They also recorded the duet &quot;O Maria!&quot; (&quot;Saagar&quot;).

Bhosle used to call R. D. Burman &quot;Bob&quot;. She married him in 1980. Their partnership lasted until his death.

R. D. Burman made her sing some of the most legendary songs in Bengali as well, namely &quot;Mohuaye Jomechhe Aaj Mou Go&quot;, &quot;Chokhe Chokhe Kotha Bolo&quot;, &quot;Chokhe Naame Brishti&quot; (Bengali version of &quot;Jaane Kya Baat Hai&quot;), &quot;Baanshi Sune Ki Ghore Thaka Jaye&quot;, &quot;Sondhya Belay Tumi Aami&quot; and &quot;Aaj Gun Gun Gun Kunje Amar&quot; (Bengali version of &quot;Pyaar Deewana Hota Hai&quot;) and many other songs.

==Non-film music==
===Private albums===
In a rare feat, noted lyricist Gulzar, music director R.D. Burman and Bhosle came together in 1987 to create a double album titled &quot;Dil Padosi Hai&quot;, which was released on 8 September 1987. In 1995, Bhosle underwent the &quot;gatha bandan&quot; (thread-tying) ceremony with Hindustani classical music maestro Ali Akbar Khan to learn a classical repertoire held within the Maihar &quot;gharana&quot; (stylistic school of Indian classical music), as handed down to Khan by his father Allauddin Khan (the guru of Ravi Shankar). Later, Bhosle and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan recorded eleven fixed compositions (or &quot;bandish&quot;es) in California for &quot;Legacy&quot;, a private album that earned them a Grammy Award nomination.

In the 1990s, Bhosle experimented with remixed R.D. Burman songs. She was criticized by many, including Khayyam, for tampering with old melodies. Nevertheless, albums like &quot;Rahul And I&quot; became quite popular. In 1997, Bhosle did a private Indipop album &quot;Janam Samjha Karo&quot; with Lesle Lewis. The album was hugely popular and won her many awards including the 1997 MTV Award.

Bhosle had been once asked by director B. R. Ishara to compose music for one of his films, but she had politely declined. In 2002, she turned music composer with the album &quot;Aap Ki Asha&quot;, an eight-song music and video album. The lyrics were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri. The album was released by Sachin Tendulkar on 21 May 2001 at a lavish party in Mumbai. The album received mixed reviews.

Bhosle had spotted Pakistani singer Adnan Sami&#x27;s talent when he was about 10 years old. At that time, she was performing in London with R. D. Burman. It was she who had asked him to pursue his interests in music. When Adnan grew up and became a professional musician, Bhosle sang the title duet with him for his best-selling album &quot;Kabhi to nazar milao&quot;. The two came together again in the album &quot;Barse Badal&quot;. The album comprises eight songs, based on Indian Classical music. She contributed the song &quot;Yun Na Thi&quot; to the recording &quot;Womad Talking Book Volume Four: An Introduction to Asia 1&quot; on Womad Records.

Bhosle has sung ghazals for many albums like &quot;Meraj-E-Ghazal&quot;, &quot;Aabshar-e-Ghazal&quot; and &quot;Kashish&quot;. In 2005, Bhosle released a self-titled album as a tribute to the four ghazal maestros – Mehdi Hassan, Ghulam Ali, Farida Khanum and Jagjit Singh. The album features eight of her favorite ghazals like Farida Khanum&#x27;s &quot;Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo&quot;, Ghulam Ali&#x27;s &quot;Chupke Chupke&quot;, &quot;Aawargi&quot; and &quot;Dil Mein Ek Lahar&quot;, Jagjit Singh&#x27;s &quot;Ahista Ahista&quot; and Mehdi Hassan&#x27;s &quot;Ranjish Hi Sahi&quot;, &quot;Rafta Rafta&quot; and &quot;Mujhe Tum Nazar Se&quot;. These classic ghazals were recreated with modern sounds by musician Pandit Somesh Mathur. The album was aimed at the younger generation, who, according to Bhosle, are &quot;turned off&quot; by the traditional sounds of tabla and sarangi.

Numerous compilations of Bhosle&#x27;s songs have been released as well. To commemorate her 60th birthday, EMI India released three cassettes: &quot;Bala Main Bairagan Hoongi&quot; (devotional songs), &quot;The Golden Collection: Memorable Ghazals&quot; (non-film ghazals by composers such as Ghulam Ali, R.D. Burman and Nazar Hussain), and &quot;The Golden Collection: The Ever Versatile Asha Bhosle&quot; (44 popular film songs).

The album was named after her age at the time of recording. About the album &quot;82&quot;, Bhosle said, &quot;I had a long association with Suresh Bhat and have a lot of memories about him. With this album, I will relive those memories. I don&#x27;t need to tell you how powerful his words were and, with the album, that power can be experienced again. Mr. Bhat always wanted to record these ghazals in the pop and rock genres and it is good to see Mandar fulfilling that wish. I just wish Mr. Bhat was among us today.&quot;

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown throughout the nation, Bhosle along with many noted artists like S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Udit Narayan, Kailash Kher, Usha Uthup, Shaan, Alka Yagnik, Sonu Nigam and other 200 artists of India, made a song named &#x27;Jayatu Jayatu Bharatam&#x27; to make the country unite during the pandemic.

==Personal life==
Bhosle house is situated in Prabhukunj Apt on the Pedder Road(now named Gopalrao Deshmukh Marg) area of South Mumbai.

Bhosle, at the age of 16, had eloped with 31-year-old Ganpatrao Bhosle. Ganpatrao was her personal secretary. Her husband and in-laws mistreated her. After a few years of marriage, Bhosle was turned out by a suspicious Ganpatrao and she went to her maternal home with two children while pregnant with her third child. They separated in 1960. The eldest of her three children, Hemant Bhosle (named after Hemant Kumar), spent most of his early years as a pilot and quit to have a brief career as a music director. Hemant Bhosle &#x27;s best known compositions were the Kishore-Bhosle duets such as &quot;Aji Kaho Kya Haal Hai&quot; from &quot;Anpadh&quot; picturised on Vijendra Ghatke and &quot;Sarika&quot; and &quot;Salamat Raho Tum&quot; from the same film &quot;Anpadh&quot; picturised on Ashok Kumar and Sarika. Hemant died of cancer in 2015. Bhosle&#x27;s daughter Varsha committed suicide on 8 October 2012; she was 56 years old and worked as a columnist for &quot;The Sunday Observer&quot; and &quot;Rediff&quot;. Bhosle&#x27;s youngest child, Anand Bhosle, has studied business and film direction. He manages Bhosle&#x27;s career. Her grandson, Chaitanya (Chintu) Bhosle (Hemant&#x27;s son) is a part of the world of music. He is a member of India&#x27;s first &amp; only boy band, &quot;A Band of Boys&quot;. Her sisters Lata and Usha Mangeshkar are playback singers. Her other, sister Meena Mangeshkar and brother Hridaynath Mangeshkar are music directors. Her granddaughter Zanai Bhosle (daughter of Anand Bhosle) runs iAzure Apple Inc. Store in Mumbai. Zanai is an emerging singer and Kathak dancer and had sung with Bhosle.

Bhosle married Rahul Dev Burman in 1980. This was the second marriage for both Rahul and Bhosle. Rahul, 6 years younger than her, earlier got divorced from Rita Patel in 1971.

Bhosle is an excellent cook and cooking is her favorite hobby. She often gets flooded with requests by Hind film celebrities for &quot;kadai ghosht&quot; and &quot;biryani&quot; dishes and has rarely turned down a request. In fact, her &quot;paya curry&quot;, &quot;Goan fish curry&quot; and &quot;dal&quot; are very popular with the Kapoor family of Hindi films. Once, when asked in a &quot;The Times of India&quot; interview, what if her singing career had not taken off, she said &quot;I would have become a cook. I&#x27;d have cooked in four houses and made money.&quot; The love of cooking got Bhosle into a successful restaurant business. She runs restaurants in Dubai and Kuwait called Bhosle&#x27;s which offers traditional north-western Indian cuisine. It has a presence in the Wafi City development in Dubai, as well as three restaurants in Kuwait, at The Avenues Mall, the Marina Mall and a brand new third outlet at the Spoons Complex. Other restaurants can be found in Abu Dhabi&#x27;s Khaldiya Mall, Doha&#x27;s Villagio and Bahrain&#x27;s City Center Mall, with future outposts planned for Dubai&#x27;s Mall of the Emirates and Cairo, Egypt. Bhosle has a 20% stake in the business. Bhosle is not involved in the day-to-day running of the restaurant which is looked after by the Wafi Group. She takes care of the kitchen and the décor. She personally trained the chefs for almost six months. According to a December 2004 report in Menu Magazine, Russell Scott, a former head of Harry Ramsden&#x27;s (the fish and chips chain), secured the UK rights to the Bhosle&#x27;s brand and planned to open up to 40 restaurants over the next five years. As part of her chain of restaurants, Bhosle has recently opened a new restaurant in Birmingham, UK. Bhosle will be on view at the Madame Tussauds gallery that opened in New Delhi in 2017.

===Rivalry with Lata Mangeshkar===
Bhosle&#x27;s sibling rivalry with Lata Mangeshkar is often talked about, in spite of their insistence that these are just tales. As young children, they were very close. As a child, Lata used to carry Bhosle all the time. They were so inseparable that when Lata went to school she would take Bhosle with her. One day the teacher protested and said that they cannot have two students on one fee. Lata refused to return to school without Bhosle and quit her studies.

Lata considered Bhosle&#x27;s act of eloping with her lover as irresponsible, leaving her alone to sing and earn for the family. This led to tensions between them. Bhosle herself stated in an interview – &quot;It was a love marriage and Lata &quot;didi&quot; did not speak to me for a long time. She disapproved of the alliance.&quot; At one time, their relationship was very adversarial and there have been periods of non-communication.

In her initial days in the industry, Bhosle always played second fiddle to her elder sister. Some say that Lata had once criticised Bhosle&#x27;s relationship with O. P. Nayyar. This widened the rift between the two sisters and O. P. Nayyar also decided that he would never work with Lata. O. P. Nayyar had once revealed that &quot;Asha and Lata, staying in opposite flats at Bombay&#x27;s Pedder Road, shared a maid. Said maid&#x27;s responsibility was to come and tell the younger sister that Lata had just recorded something wonderful for Bhosle to lose her vocal poise. Such was her Lata phobia that it took me some months to convince Bhosle that she had a voice individualistic enough to evolve a singing style all of her own.&quot; Bhosle once said that she has worked for years to create a voice and a style that was different from Lata, so that she could carve her own niche and not be banished to live in her sister&#x27;s shadow.

Bhosle and Lata have also sung together. Their first duet was for the film &quot;Daman&quot; (1951). Some of their songs include &quot;Man Bhawan Ke Ghar aye&quot; (&quot;Chori Chori&quot;, 1956), &quot;Sakhi ri sun bole papihaa us paar&quot; (&quot;Miss Mary&quot;, 1957), &quot;O chand jahaan woh jayein&quot; (&quot;Sharada&quot;, 1957), &quot;Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahi&quot; (&quot;Mere Mehboob&quot;, 1963), &quot;Unse Nazrein Mili&quot; (&quot;Gazal&quot;, 1964), &quot;Ai kash kisi deewane ko&quot; (&quot;Aaye Din Bahar Ke&quot;, 1966), &quot;Jabse Laagi Toose Najariya&quot; (&quot;Shikar, 1968&quot;), &quot;Main Haseena Nazneena Koi Mujhsa Nahi&quot; &quot;(Baazi, 1968)&quot;, &quot;Main Chali Main Chali&quot; (&quot;Padosan&quot;, 1968), &quot;Chhap tilak sab&quot; (&quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot;, 1978), and &quot;Man kyun behka&quot; (&quot;Utsav&quot;, 1984). While singing, Lata used to hold her notebook in her right hand, while Bhosle held hers in the left hand. This meant Lata had her face away from Bhosle, making it difficult for them to &quot;anticipate&quot; each other.

The movie &quot;Saaz&quot; was supposedly based on Lata and Bhosle&#x27;s rivalry. Bhosle said about the movie – &quot;To have two women in long plaits, take a couple of incidents and exaggerate them into a 3-hour film is such a waste of time.&quot; In the last few years, Bhosle and Lata have often been seen in public, enjoying each other&#x27;s company. In an interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Bhosle once said – &quot;I remember, sometimes both of us would be at a function and some industry types would ignore me and interact only with her, as if to prove their loyalty. Later, didi and I would have a good laugh!&quot;

==In popular culture==
British alternative rock band Cornershop released &quot;Brimful of Asha&quot; in 1997. The song, dedicated to Bhosle, became an international hit single for the band and topped the UK Singles Chart in February 1998. A number of remixes have been released as well, notably by Norman Cook, also known as Fatboy Slim.

(Mangeshkar asked not to be considered for the award nominations after 1969 to promote new talent). After receiving the award in 1979, Bhosle emulated her elder sister and requested that her name not be considered for the nominations hereafter. Despite this, Bhosle is the most frequent winner of this award to date, tying with Alka Yagnik. She was later given a &quot;Special Award&quot; for &quot;Rangeela&quot; in 1996, and the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001. Following is the list of her Filmfare Awards:

<text>Sir John Robert Seeley, KCMG (10 September 1834 – 13 January 1895) was an English Liberal historian and political essayist. A founder of British imperial history, he was a prominent advocate for the British Empire, promoting a concept of Greater Britain. This he expounded in his most widely known book &quot;The Expansion of England&quot; (1883). While he was an early advocate of the establishment of political science as a distinct academic discipline, he retained a theological approach in which this was embedded.

==Early life==
Seeley was born in London. His father was Robert Benton Seeley, a publisher who issued books under the name of Seeley, Jackson and Halliday, was a strong advocate of Evangelical Anglicanism, and was the author of several religious books and of &quot;The Life and Times of Edward I&quot;. His mother was Mary Ann Jackson (1809–1868), who shared her husband&#x27;s religious views. Her brother, John Henry Jackson, was a partner in Robert Seeley&#x27;s publishing company. John was related to the chemist Arthur Herbert Church, a cousin through his mother.

John was educated at City of London School, where he enjoyed history, theology and literature. While there, he wrote two essays comparing Shakespeare and classical Greek drama in 1850 and 1851, the latter of which won him a Beaufoy Prize, now held by the Heberden Coin Room, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. He went on to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was head of the Classical tripos and senior Chancellor&#x27;s medallist. His education at Cambridge was interrupted by illness and he only completed his exams in 1858. During his time at Christ&#x27;s he became friends with Charles Stuart Calverley, John Wesley Hales, Walter Besant, Walter Skeat and Walter Sendall. He was elected a fellow of Christ&#x27;s and subsequently became a classical studies tutor at the college. He published an anonymous book of poetry and then went through a personal crisis during which he abandoned many of the conventional beliefs of his youth and sought to replace them with more well-founded and secure beliefs. He left Cambridge in 1860.

==Middle and later life==
Seeley returned to his old school, where he became a teacher. In 1863, he was appointed professor of Latin at University College, London. This drew him into quite different intellectual circles. Seeley believed many of the staff at University College to be anti-Christian. Some of these—and of his other London acquaintances—were Positivists who followed Auguste Comte in asserting that all genuine knowledge was based on experiment and logic, and some of whom were interested in Comte&#x27;s Religion of Humanity. One such was Edward Spencer Beesly. Seeley also mixed with Christian Socialists, and in 1862 and 1863 taught in the Working Men&#x27;s College under its founder and principal, F. D. Maurice.

Seeley developed his own approach to reconciling religion with the needs of modern society, which bore fruit in 1865 with his first published book, &quot;Ecce Homo: A Survey of the Life and Work of Jesus Christ.&quot; His authorship was anonymous partly because he feared upsetting colleagues and members of his family with views that might seem impious, but several of them were upset anyway, the authorship becoming an open secret by the end of 1866. However, the work, widely controversial as it was, attracted favourable attention as well as disparagement. One of the warmest reviews was penned by the leading politician William Gladstone. In 1869 Gladstone, having become Prime Minister the previous year, bore the duty of recommending a new Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, an appointment that went to Seeley despite his lack of publications in the field, after two other preferred candidates dropped out.

In August 1869, Seeley married Mary Agnes Phillot (1839–1921), who was a granddaughter of William Frend and a sister of Constance Phillott. Despite his Cambridge appointment, the couple maintained their main home in London until 1880, although Seeley often stayed in lodgings at the University in term time. As Regius Professor, Seeley described himself as a Liberal in politics, but a Radical in education; he made important contributions to education reform, including on the admission of women into the ancient universities.

He is buried in the Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge, with his wife.

==Works==
===&quot;Ecce Homo: A Survey in the Life and Work of Jesus Christ&quot; (1865)===
Seeley&#x27;s first published book was &quot;Ecce Homo: A Survey of the Life and Work of Jesus Christ&quot;, which was published anonymously in 1865. It set itself the questions: &quot;What was Christ&#x27;s object in founding the Society which is called by his name, and how is it adapted to attain that object?&quot; and proposed to investigate these by studying Jesus biographically, without relying on the established views of religious authorities but looking at &quot;the facts themselves, critically weighed&quot;. It purports to show how Jesus, through the impressiveness of his personality and the brilliance of his plan, created a &quot;divine society...that...has extended over a large and the most highly civilised portion of the earth&#x27;s surface, and...continues full of vigour at the present day&quot;, and how, for the members of this society, Jesus &quot;raised the feeling of humanity from being a feeble restraining power to be an inspiring passion&quot;.

The book sold well on its release, partly due to being controversial among reviewers and public figures, the controversy being cleverly stimulated by its publisher, Macmillan. The eminent politician Lord Shaftesbury famously spoke of it as a &quot;most pestilential book...vomited from the jaws of Hell&quot;. Many, in more moderate language, expressed disgust or mistrust at its avoidance of mainstream theological themes such as affirmation of the reality of Christ&#x27;s miracles. But others found it to be a sincere-sounding defence of faith for the modern-minded from the more extreme scepticism propounded in the Lives of Jesus written by David Strauss and Ernest Renan. The widespread perplexity was summed up by Cardinal Newman in writing that it was impossible to tell whether the author was &quot;an orthodox believer on his road to liberalism, or a liberal on his road to orthodoxy&quot;.

Many considered the book to be extraordinary in its prose style in addition to in its content. It is characterised by relatively terse and fluid prose. Its anonymous status also added a significant dimension to the controversy surrounding its publication, as readers sought to discover the author&#x27;s identity. George Eliot, John Henry Newman, William Ewart Gladstone and Napoleon III were some of the more well-known figures believed to have written the book. Seeley was eventually discovered as the author, and from November 1866, his authorship became an open secret. However, Seeley declined to acknowledge publicly his authorship of &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, which was first officially stated only in a posthumous edition that was produced in 1895.

===Subsequent work===
His later essay on &quot;Natural Religion&quot;, signed &quot;by the Author of &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;,&quot; which denied that supernaturalism is essential to religion and maintained that the negations of science tend to purify rather than destroy Christianity, satisfied few and excited far less interest than his earlier work. In 1869, Seeley was appointed professor of modern history at the University of Cambridge. He was a popular instructor and prepared his lectures carefully, which were well attended. In historical work, he is distinguished as a thinker rather than as a scholar. He valued history solely in its relation to politics as the science of the state. He maintained that history should be studied scientifically and for a practical purpose, the solution of existing political questions. Thus, he naturally devoted himself mainly to recent history, especially the relations between England and other states. His &quot;Life and Times of Stein&quot;, a valuable narrative of the anti-Napoleonic revolt, led by Prussia mainly at Heinrich Friedrich Karl von und zum Stein&#x27;s instigation, was written under German influence and shows little of the style of his short essays. Its length, its colourlessness and the space that it devotes to subsidiary matters render it unattractive.

===&quot;The Expansion of England&quot; (1883)===
Far otherwise was Seeley&#x27;s &quot;The Expansion of England&quot; (1883). Written in his best manner, that essay answered to his theory that history should be used for a practical purpose and pointed out how and why Britain gained its colonies and India, the character of the British Empire and the light in which it should be regarded. As a historical essay, the book was a fine composition, and its defence of the empire was then very persuasive. His defence consisted largely of the claim that British rule was in India&#x27;s best interest. Seeley also questioned the usefulness of India to the power and security of Britain and even claimed that there was &#x27;no doubt&#x27; that India vastly increased the responsibilities and dangers to Britain. The book contains this much-quoted statement: &quot;we seem, as it were, to have conquered half the world in a fit of absence of mind.&quot; It appeared at an opportune time and did much to make Englishmen regard the colonies not as mere appendages but as an expansion of the British state as well as of British nationality and to remind them of the value of the empire in the East. The essay was reprinted ten times in the year in which it was published and many more times in later years. In 1894 Seeley was rewarded for public service by being made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, on the recommendation of Lord Rosebery.

In the spring of 1883, Seeley started a debate over the Tripos bachelor&#x27;s honours exam at Cambridge, wishing it to concentrate on political history, but historians Frederick William Maitland, George Walter Prothero, Henry Melvill Gwatkin and Mandell Creighton argued for a broader more scientific approach, reaching a compromise emphasising the reading of primary sources, requiring a compulsory paper on &quot;Political Science&quot;, with required readings including &quot;Introduction to Political Science&quot; (1896) by Seeley and &quot;The Elements of Politics&quot; (1891) by Sidgwick.

===&quot;The Growth of British Policy&quot;===
His last book, &quot;The Growth of British Policy&quot;, written as an essay and intended to be an introduction to a full account of the expansion of Britain, was published posthumously.

===Later matters===
Inagaki Manjiro dedicated his &quot;Japan and the Pacific and the Japanese View of the Eastern Question&quot; (1890) to Seeley, who had taught him at Caius College.

Correspondence to and from Seeley, including that relating to the publication of and reactions to &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, is held by the archives in Senate House Library.

In 1897, the history library of the University of Cambridge was named the Seeley Historical Library in his honour. In 1895 a memorial fund was raised to commemorate his services to the British Empire and to the University; the greater part of this fund was devoted to the endowment of the library. After moving from King&#x27;s College and Caius College, in 1912, the collection relocated to the newly reopened Arts School, Bene&#x27;t Street, then in 1935 to the Old Schools. In 1968 the Seeley moved to the Sidgwick Site of Cambridge University as part of the new History Faculty building designed by James Stirling.

==Significance of empire==
Seeley wrote that the first chapter of the history of British India &quot;embraces chronologically the first half of George III&#x27;s reign, that stormy period of transition in English history when at the same time America was lost and India won... [and] covers the two great careers of Robert Clive and Hastings... [T]he end of the struggle is marked by the reign of Lord Cornwallis, which began in 1785&quot;.

The trial of Warren Hastings had been the final act in the efforts spanning the eighteenth century to harness imperial power, along with imperial wealth and prestige, securely to Britain, both as a &quot;nation&quot; and as a &quot;state&quot;. Once Edmund Burke had succeeded in that endeavour, the stain of commercial origins could be removed, with the special mix of economic and political interests realigned as the expression of national interest and the blot of scandal washed out, as the moral mandate for a new kind of imperial project was launched.

===Blinkers of English historiography===
Seeley was far more astute than many later imperial historians, as he complained that very transformation had made possible a national amnesia about the significance of empire in the history of England itself. His lectures were filled with a critique of the blinkers of English historiography: &quot;They [our historians] make too much of the parliamentary wrangle and the agitations about liberty, in all which matters the eighteenth century of England was but a pale reflection of the seventeenth. They do not perceive that in that century the history of England is not in England but in Americas and Asia&quot;.

===Justifications for empire===
Seeley&#x27;s account of imperial wars and conquest repeats the justifications made first by the conquerors themselves: the sole objective of trade turned into political conquest by accident, rather than contrivance or calculation.

Most historians have argued that the East India Company was drawn reluctantly into political and military conflict in India, and took an interest in territorial power and revenue only as a last-ditch effort to protect its trading activities. Among the narratives of imperial historians, Seeley concurred and wrote that India &quot;lay there waiting to be picked up by somebody&quot;. He considered that what happened in India in the late 18th century was thus an &quot;internal revolution&quot;, rather than a &quot;foreign conquest&quot;.

==Notable quotations==
&quot;History is the school of statesmanship&quot;.

&quot;History without politics descends to mere literature&quot;.

He is often erroneously believed to have said, &quot;History is past politics, and politics present history&quot;.

<text>Branxton is a village and civil parish in northern Northumberland, England. It lies about from the England-Scotland border and about from the Scottish border town of Coldstream, just off the A697 Newcastle-Edinburgh road. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 123, increasing slightly from 121 at the 2001 Census.

== Landmarks ==
Branxton is very close to the site of the Battle of Flodden, fought on 9 September 1513 between Scotland and England, the latter prevailing. A granite cross on the nearby Piper Hill (UK map reference NT890373) commemorates the battle. In 2013, the local community commemorated the 500 year anniversary of the battle. 

Pallinsburn House, an 18th-century country mansion, stands nearby.

There is a painted concrete menagerie in the garden of one of the houses in the village. The sculptures were made, starting in 1962, by James Beveridge to designs by retired joiner John Fairnington (d. 1981) to amuse his disabled son, Edwin. As well as animals, there are statues of Winston Churchill, T. E. Lawrence and Robert Burns, and many texts set into the plinths and pathways. It has been a popular tourist attraction, with its own tea room, and may still be accessible by the public for free (although with a coin box for voluntary donations).

== Religious sites ==
The parish church, dedicated to Saint Paul, occupies the site of an ancient church which was taken down and replaced by the present structure in 1849.

== Notable people ==
*Percival Stockdale, (1736–1811) poet, writer and reformer, especially in opposing slavery.

<text>Gold, also called golden, is a color tone resembling the gold chemical element.

The web color &quot;gold&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;golden&quot; to distinguish it from the color &quot;metallic gold&quot;. The use of &quot;gold&quot; as a color term in traditional usage is more often applied to the color &quot;metallic gold&quot; (shown below).

The first recorded use of &quot;golden&quot; as a color name in English was in 1300 to refer to the element gold. The word &quot;gold&quot; as a color name was first used in 1400 and in 1423 to refer to blond hair.

Metallic gold, such as in paint, is often called goldtone or gold tone, or gold ground when describing a solid gold background. In heraldry, the French word or is used. In model building, the color gold is different from brass. A shiny or metallic silvertone object can be painted with transparent yellow to obtain goldtone, something often done with Christmas decorations.

== Metallic gold ==

=== Gold (metallic gold) ===

At right is displayed a representation of the color metallic gold (the color traditionally known as &quot;gold&quot;) which is a simulation of the color of the actual metallic element gold itself—gold &quot;shade&quot;.

The source of this color is the ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (1955), a color dictionary used by stamp collectors to identify the colors of stamps—See color sample of the color Gold (Color Sample Gold (T) #84) displayed on indicated web page:

=== Web color gold vs. metallic gold ===

The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; defines the color metallic gold as &quot;A light olive-brown to dark yellow, or a moderate, strong to vivid yellow.&quot;

Of course, the visual sensation usually associated with the metal gold is its metallic shine. This cannot be reproduced by a simple solid color, because the shiny effect is due to the material&#x27;s reflective brightness varying with the surface&#x27;s angle to the light source.

This is why, in art, a metallic paint that glitters in an approximation of real gold would be used; a solid color like that of the cell displayed in the adjacent box does not aesthetically &quot;read&quot; as gold. Especially in sacral art in Christian churches, real gold (as gold leaf) was used for rendering gold in paintings, e.g. for the halo of saints. Gold can also be woven into sheets of silk to give an East Asian traditional look.

More recent art styles, e.g. Art Nouveau, also made use of a metallic, shining gold; however, the metallic finish of such paints was added using fine aluminum powder and pigment rather than actual gold.

== Shades ==

Old gold is a dark yellow, which varies from heavy olive or olive brown to deep or strong yellow. The widely accepted color old gold is on the darker rather than the lighter side of this range.

When the team first switched from shades of blue to black and gold in 1980, the color scheme was similar to that of the Bruins, who protested the Penguins&#x27; new uniforms. The protest failed—largely due to Pittsburgh having a tradition of sports teams wearing gold and black—and the Penguins wore the shade of gold, now dubbed &quot;Pittsburgh gold&quot;, until 2002 and once again in 2014.

<doc id="251088" wikidata="Q3643409" url="?curid=251088" title="William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne">
<text>William Waldegrave Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne (17 October 185926 February 1942), styled Viscount Wolmer between 1882 and 1895, was a British politician and colonial administrator, who served as High Commissioner for Southern Africa.

==Background and education==
Selborne was the son of Lord Chancellor Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, and Lady Laura, daughter of Vice-Admiral William Waldegrave, 8th Earl Waldegrave. He was educated at Temple Grove School, Winchester College and University College, Oxford, where he took a first class degree in history.

He was commissioned as a Second lieutenant in the part-time 3rd (Hampshire Militia) Battalion, Hampshire Regiment on 21 May 1879, promoted to Lieutenant on 23 March 1881, Captain on 29 July 1885, and to the command as a Lieutenant-Colonel on 22 April 1899. At the end of his term of command he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the battalion on 23 July 1904, a position that he retained until his death, by which time he was the only remaining officer of the battalion, which had never been re-embodied after World War I.

==Political career==

===1882–1910===

As Viscount Wolmer, he was assistant private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Childers, from 1882 to 1885, when he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Petersfield. Like his father, he became a Liberal Unionist in 1886 when William Ewart Gladstone proposed Irish Home Rule. He retained his seat till 1892, when he was elected for Edinburgh West. Despite succeeding to the Earldom on his father&#x27;s death, on 13 May 1895 he attempted to sit as before in the Commons, arguing that, although he was now a Peer, he had not requested a writ of summons to the Lords. After some debate, on 21 May the Commons moved a by-election writ. 

After the 1895 general election, Selborne, now sitting in the Lords, was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies by his father-in-law Lord Salisbury, where he became junior to the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. During the difficult period before the outbreak of the Second Boer War he progressed rapidly. In November 1900, Selborne was sworn of the Privy Council and made First Lord of the Admiralty under Salisbury, with a seat in the cabinet, an office he retained when Arthur Balfour became Prime Minister in 1902. In 1905 he succeeded Lord Milner as High Commissioner for Southern Africa and governor of the Transvaal and Orange River colonies. He assumed office at Pretoria in May of that year. He had gone out with the intention of guiding the destinies of South Africa during a period when the ex-Boer republics would be in a transitional state between crown colony government and self-government, and letters patent were issued granting the Transvaal representative institutions.

But the Liberal Party came into office in Britain the following December, before the new constitution had been established, and, the decision was now taken to give both the Transvaal and Orange River colonies self-government without delay. Lord Selborne accepted the changed situation, and the experiment proved successful, from the perspective of avoiding a further war with the Boers. But the new constitution allowed the franchise only to those of European descent, and Selborne pushed through policies to keep out non-white immigrants, stating that Indians were not wanted because they didn’t know how to use arms.

He ceased to be governor of the Orange River Colony on its assumption of Responsible government in June 1907, but retained his other posts until May 1910, retiring on the eve of the establishment of the Union of South Africa.

The despatch, dated 7 January 1907 and known as the Selborne Memorandum, in which he reviewed the situation in its economic and political aspects, was a comprehensive statement of the dangers inherent in the existing system and of the advantages likely to attend union. The document had in fact been compiled by Lionel Curtis and other members of Milner&#x27;s Kindergarten. The force of its appeal had a marked influence on the course of events, while the loyalty with which Lord Selborne co-operated with the Botha administration was an additional factor in reconciling the Dutch and British communities.

===1910–1942===
He returned to England with his reputation, according to the &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;as a statesman enhanced by the respect of all parties, and with a practical experience, second only to that of Lord Milner, of British imperialism in successful operation.&quot; His experience made him a valuable ally in the movement among the Unionist party at home for Tariff Reform and Imperial Preference, to which he could now give his full support.

In 1915 Selborne returned to government during the First World War when he became President of the Board of Agriculture in the war time coalition of Liberal prime minister H. H. Asquith. He resigned from Cabinet in June 1916 because of David Lloyd George&#x27;s handling of the botched Home Rule negotiations (May–July) and the Prime Minister&#x27;s failure to bring Lloyd George to task while the negotiations were still in progress. Selborne did not hold high political office again. The Selborne Committee on Church and State from 1914 to 1916 was chaired by Lord Selborne.

Apart from his political career Selborne served as Master of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in 1910 and 1933, as his father had done before him, in 1875. In 1916, he was elected a member of the Society for Psychical Research. He was also Warden of Winchester College between 1920 and 1925 and High Steward of Winchester between 1929 and 1942. In 1939, after the failure of the Munich Agreement and appeasement in general to halt Nazi Germany&#x27;s expansionism in Continental Europe, he wrote a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; advocating for Winston Churchill to be admitted into the National Government Cabinet. He was made a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1909.

==Family==
Lord Selborne married Lady Maud Cecil, elder daughter of future Prime Minister Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, in 1883. A Suiderberg, Pretoria district, Lady Selborne, is named after her.

They had three sons and one daughter.
* Lady Mabel Laura Georgiana Palmer (6 October 188415 July 1958); married Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey, and had two daughters.
* Roundell Cecil Palmer, 3rd Earl of Selborne (15 April 18873 September 1971); married, firstly, Hon. Grace Ridley in 1910; had issue. Married, secondly, Valerie Irene Josephine Margaret de Thomka de Thomkahaza in 1966; no issue.
* Hon. Robert Stafford Arthur Palmer (26 September 188821 January 1916)
* Hon. William Jocelyn &quot;Lewis&quot; Palmer (15 September 18946 June 1971); married Hon. Dorothy Cicely Sybil Loder in 1922 and had two children.

His second son, the Hon. Robert Palmer, was a captain in the Hampshire Regiment and was killed on active service in Mesopotamia in 1916. His daughter was Lady Mabel Laura Georgiana Palmer, who became Countess Grey as the wife of Charles Grey, 5th Earl Grey. His letters home were privately published as &quot;Letters from Mesopotamia&quot;. Lord Selborne died in February 1942, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Roundell, Viscount Wolmer, who had already the previous year been summoned to the House of Lords by writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Selborne. The Countess of Selborne died in April 1950.

<doc id="251093" wikidata="Q1217502" url="?curid=251093" title="Hugh Childers">
<text>Hugh Culling Eardley Childers (25 June 1827 – 29 January 1896) was a British Liberal of the nineteenth century. He is perhaps best known for his reform efforts at the Admiralty and the War Office. Later in his career, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, his attempt to correct a budget shortfall led to the fall of the Liberal government led by William Gladstone.

==Early life==
Childers was born in London, the son of Reverend Eardley Childers and his wife Maria Charlotte (&quot;née&quot; Smith),
sister of Sir Culling Eardley, 3rd Baronet and granddaughter of Sampson Eardley, 1st Baron Eardley. He was educated at Cheam School under Pestalozzi and then both Wadham College, Oxford and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. from the latter in 1850. Influential on his intellectual development were Adam Smith&#x27;s theories of free trade, and capital returns.

Childers then decided to seek a career in Australia and on 26 October 1850 arrived in Melbourne, Victoria along with his wife Emily Walker.

==Australia==
Childers joined the government of Victoria and served as Inspector of Denominational schools (meaning Protestant and Catholic schools) and immigration agent. In 1852 he became a director of the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company. Childers became auditor-general on 26 October 1852 and was nominated to the Victorian Legislative Council. In 1852 he placed a bill before the colonial legislature proposing the establishment of a university for Victoria, the second in Australia following the foundation of the University of Sydney in 1850. With the receipt of the Royal Assent in 1853, the University of Melbourne was founded, with Childers as its first vice-chancellor. Childers was Collector of Customs from 5 December 1853 to 28 November 1855 and Commissioner of Trade and Customs 28 November 1855 to 25 February 1857. Childers was elected to the inaugural Victorian Legislative Assembly for Portland in November 1856, a seat he held until resigning in February 1857.

==Return to Britain==
Childers retained the vice-chancellorship until his return to Britain in March 1857 and received an M.A. from Cambridge in the same year.

==Enters British politics==
In 1860 he entered the House of Commons as a Liberal member for Pontefract, and within a few years joined the government of Lord Palmerston, becoming a Civil Lord of the Admiralty in 1864 and then Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1865.

==First Lord of the Admiralty==

With the election of Gladstone&#x27;s government in December 1868, he rose to greater prominence, serving as First Lord of the Admiralty. Childers &quot;had a reputation for being hardworking, but inept, autocratic and notoriously overbearing in his dealing with colleagues.&quot; He &quot;initiated a determined programme of cost and manpower reductions, fully backed by the Prime Minister, Gladstone described him [Childers] as &#x27;a man likely to scan with a rigid eye the civil expenses of the Naval Service&#x27;. He got the naval estimates just below the psychologically important figure of £10,000,000. Childers strengthened his own position as First Lord by reducing the role of the Board of Admiralty to a purely formal one, making meetings rare and short and confining the Sea Lords rigidly to the administrative functions... Initially Childers had the support of the influential Controller of the Navy, Vice-Admiral Sir [Robert] Spencer Robinson.&quot; &quot;His re-organisation of the Admiralty was unpopular and poorly done.&quot;

Childers was responsible for the construction of HMS &quot;Captain&quot; in defiance of the advice of his professional advisers, the Controller (Robinson) and the Chief Constructor Edward James Reed. &quot;Captain&quot; was commissioned in April 1870, and sank on the night of 6/7 September 1870. She was, as predicted by Robinson and Reed, insufficiently stable. &quot;Shortly before the battleship sank, Childers had moved his son, Midshipman Leonard Childers from Reed&#x27;s designed HMS Monarch onto the new ship-of-the-line; Leonard did not survive.&quot; Childers &quot;faced strong criticism following the Court Martial on the loss of &quot;HMS Captain&quot;, and attempted to clear his name with a 359-page memorandum, a move described as &quot;dubious public ethics&quot;. Vice Admiral Sir Robert Spencer Robinson wrote &#x27;His endeavors were directed to throw the blame which might be supposed to attach to himself on those who had throughout expressed their disapproval of such methods of construction&#x27;.&quot; Childers unfairly blamed Robinson for the loss of the &quot;Captain&quot;, and as a result of this Robinson was replaced as Third Lord and Controller of the navy in February 1871. &quot;Following the loss of his son and the recriminations that followed, Childers resigned through ill health as First Lord in March 1871.&quot;

==1871–1880==
Following his resignation he spent some months on the Continent, and recovered sufficiently to take office in 1872 as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The consequent ministerial by-election on 15 August 1872 was the first Parliamentary election to be held after the Ballot Act 1872 required the use of a secret ballot.

==Secretary for War==

When the Liberals regained power in 1880, Childers was appointed Secretary for War, a position he accepted reluctantly. He therefore had to bear responsibility for cuts in arms expenditure, a policy that provoked controversy when Britain began fighting; first the Boers in South Africa in 1880 and then the invasion of Egypt in 1882. Childers was also very unpopular with Horse Guards for the reinforcement and expansion of the Cardwell reforms. On 1 May 1881 he passed General Order 41, which outlined a series of improvements known as the Childers reforms.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
Childers became Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1882, a post he had coveted. As such, he attempted to implement a conversion of Consols in 1884. Although the scheme proved a failure, it paved the way for the subsequent conversion in 1888. He attempted to resolve a budget shortfall in June 1885 by increasing alcohol duty and income tax. His budget was rejected by Parliament, and the government – already unpopular due to events in Egypt – was forced out of office. Childers&#x27;s colleague the Earl of Rosebery commented resignedly: &quot;So far as I know the budget is as good a question to go out upon as any other, and Tuesday as good a day.&quot;

==Home Secretary==
At the subsequent election in December 1885 Childers lost his Pontefract seat, but returned as an independent Home Ruler for Edinburgh South (one of the few Liberals who adopted this policy before Gladstone&#x27;s conversion in 1886). Childers then served as Home Secretary in the short-lived ministry of 1886. He was critical of the financial clauses of the First Home Rule Bill, and their withdrawal was largely due to his threat of resignation. Nevertheless, the bill still failed to pass, and its rejection brought down the Liberal government.

==Retirement and the Childers Commission==
He retired from parliament in 1892, and his last piece of work was the drafting of a report for the 1894 &quot;Financial Relations Commission&quot; on Irish financial matters, of which he was chairman (generally known as the Childers Commission). This found that, compared to the rest of the United Kingdom, Ireland had been overtaxed on a per capita basis by some £2 or £3 million annually in previous decades. The matter was finally debated in March 1897. In the following decades Irish nationalists frequently quoted the report as proof that some form of fiscal freedom was needed to end imperial over-taxation, which was prolonging Irish poverty. Their opponents noted that the extra tax received had come from an unduly high consumption of tea, stout, whiskey and tobacco, and not from income tax. His younger cousin Erskine Childers wrote a book on the matter in 1911.

Childers&#x27; 1894 report was still considered influential in 1925 in considering the mutual financial positions between the new Irish Free State and the United Kingdom. In 1926 an Irish Senate debate included claims by some Senators that, with compound interest, Ireland was owed as much as £1.2 billion by Britain. This, however, ignored the changed economic conditions since 1894, and at the eve of secession Southern Ireland was being heavily subsidised by the British taxpayer. This economic reality forced the initial Irish Free State government to cut the old age pension from five to four shillings. In 1932 on the start of the Anglo-Irish Trade War, the Irish government made a claim for £400 million in respect of past overtaxation, amongst others, but this was not mentioned when the dispute was settled in 1938.

==Family, later life and death==
Childers married Emily Walker in 1850. They had six sons and two daughters. One of their daughters, Emily &quot;Milly&quot; Childers, was a portrait and landscape painter. His first wife died in 1875 and Childers married Katherine Anne Gilbert in 1879. A cousin, Erskine Childers, was the author of the spy novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, an important figure in the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War (during which he was executed), and father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers.

Towards the end of his ministerial career &quot;HCE&quot; Childers was known for his girth, and so acquired the nickname &quot;Here Comes Everybody&quot;, which was later used as a motif in &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; by James Joyce.

Childers died in January 1896, aged 68. He is buried on the south side of the central enclosed roundel in Brompton Cemetery, London.

<doc id="251097" wikidata="Q2698623" url="?curid=251097" title="Henry Alford (theologian)">
<text>Henry Alford (7 October 181012 January 1871) was an English churchman, theologian, textual critic, scholar, poet, hymnodist, and writer.

==Life==
Alford was born at 25 Alfred Place, Bedford Square, London 

of a Somersetshire family, which had given five consecutive generations of clergymen to the Anglican church. Alford&#x27;s early years were passed with his widowed father, who was curate of Steeple Ashton in Wiltshire. He was a precocious lad, and before he was ten had written several Latin odes, a history of the Jews and a series of homiletic outlines. After a peripatetic school course he went up to Cambridge in 1827 as a scholar of Trinity in 1827. In 1832 he was 34th wrangler and 8th classic, and in 1834 was made a fellow of Trinity.

==Service==
He had already taken orders, and in 1835 began his eighteen years&#x27; tenure of the vicarage of Wymeswold in Leicestershire, from which seclusion the twice-repeated offer of a colonial bishopric failed to draw him. He was Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1841–1842, and steadily built up a reputation as scholar and preacher, which would have been enhanced but for his discursive ramblings in the fields of minor poetry and magazine editing.

In 1844, he joined the Cambridge Camden Society (CCS) which published a list of do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts for church layout which they promoted as a science. He commissioned A.W.N. Pugin to restore St Mary&#x27;s church. He also was a member of the Metaphysical Society, founded in 1869 by James Knowles.

In September 1853 Alford moved to Quebec Street Chapel, Marylebone, London, where he had a large and cultured congregation. In March 1857 Lord Palmerston advanced him to the deanery of Canterbury, where, till his death [...], he lived the same strenuous and diversified life that had always characterized him.

==Personal life==
Henry Alford married his cousin Frances (Fanny) Oke Alford on 10 March 1835 in Curry Rivel, Somerset. They had four children, all born in Wymeswold, of whom both the sons died in childhood. The first was Clement Henry Oke, who died in 1844, aged 11 months; the second was his elder brother Ambrose Oke, who died in Babbacombe, Torquay aged 10, on 31 August 1850.

Henry and Francis&#x27; two daughters were:

Henry Alford was the friend of many of his eminent contemporaries, and was much loved for his amiable character. He was buried at St Martin&#x27;s Church, Canterbury. A description of the funeral and a tribute to Dean Alford were published in &quot;The Times&quot;. &quot;The inscription on his tomb, chosen by himself, is &quot;Diversorium Viatoris Hierosolymam Proficiscentis&quot; (&#x27;the lodging place of a traveller on his way to Jerusalem&#x27;).&quot; 
Frances Alford died in Middlesex on 18 November 1878.

==Published works==

Alford was a talented artist, as his picture-book &quot;The Riviera&quot; (1870) shows, and he had abundant musical and mechanical talent. Besides editing the works of John Donne, he published several volumes of his own verse, &quot;The School of the Heart&quot; (1835), &quot;The Abbot of Muchelnaye&quot; (1841), &quot;The Greek Testament. The Four Gospels&quot; (1849), and a number of hymns, the best-known of which are &quot;Forward! be our watchword,&quot; &quot;Come, ye thankful people, come&quot;, and &quot;Ten thousand times ten thousand.&quot; He translated the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, wrote a well-known manual of idiom,&quot;A Plea for the Queen&#x27;s English&quot; (1863), and was the first editor of the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; (1866–1870).

His chief fame, however, rests on his monumental edition of the New Testament in Greek (8 vols.), on which he worked from 1841 to 1861. In this work he first brought before English students a careful collation of the readings of the chief manuscripts and the researches of the ripest continental scholarship of his day. Philological rather than theological in character, it marked an epochal change from the old homiletic commentary, and though more recent research, patristic and papyral, has largely changed the method of New Testament exegesis, Alford&#x27;s work is still a quarry where the student can dig with a good deal of profit. 

See Alford&#x27;s Law for an example. Alford subsequently published the &quot;New Testament for English Readers&quot; (4 vols., Rivingtons, 1868). &quot;His &quot;Life&quot;, written by his widow, appeared in 1873 (Rivingtons).&quot;

<text>Major General Philip Michael Jeffery, (12 December 1937 – 18 December 2020) was a senior Australian Army officer and vice-regal representative. He was the 28th governor of Western Australia from 1993 to 2000, and the 24th governor-general of Australia, serving from 2003 to 2008.

From Perth, Western Australia, Jeffery graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and served in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War, being awarded the Military Cross during the latter conflict.

Jeffery was at various stages commander of the Special Air Service Regiment and the 1st Division, and subsequently Deputy Chief of General Staff, before retiring from active service in 1993. After serving for seven years as Governor of Western Australia, Jeffery was appointed Governor-General of Australia in 2003, following the resignation of Peter Hollingworth. He was the first career Australian Army officer to hold the position, and was succeeded by Quentin Bryce.

==Early life and military career==
Jeffery was born in Wiluna, Western Australia, on 12 December 1937, and was educated at Kent Street Senior High School. At 16 he left Perth to attend the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in Canberra.

After graduating in 1958, he served in a number of junior positions before being posted to Malaya in 1962 for operational service. From 1966 to 1969 he served in Papua New Guinea. During this posting, he married Marlena Kerr of Sydney, with whom he had three sons and a daughter. This was followed by a tour of duty in the Vietnam War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross (MC).

In 1972, Jeffery was promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanding the 2nd Battalion of the Pacific Islands Regiment from 1974 to 1975. He assumed command of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) in Perth from 7 January 1976 until 22 October 1977, and was then promoted to colonel as the first Director of the Army&#x27;s Special Action Forces in 1979.

From 1982 to 1983, Jeffery headed Australia&#x27;s national counter-terrorist co-ordination authority. In 1985 he was promoted to major general, being appointed to command the 1st Division the following year. In 1990 he became Deputy Chief of the General Staff and in 1991 he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff for Materiel.

Jeffery retired from the army in 1993, and was appointed to the ceremonial position of Honorary Colonel of the SASR.

==Career==

=== Governor of Western Australia (1993–2000) ===
In November 1993, Jeffery was appointed Governor of Western Australia and in June 1996 he was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) on 1 April 2000.

During his seven years in the post he made a number of public statements of his conservative views on marriage, sex and education. He received some criticism from the Labor opposition and sections of the media for appearing to take positions on political issues.

=== Governor-General of Australia (2003–2008) ===
Following the resignation of Peter Hollingworth as Governor-General of Australia, Prime Minister John Howard announced on 22 June 2003 that he had chosen Jeffery to succeed Hollingworth. He was formally appointed by Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia and sworn in on 11 August 2003, becoming the first Australian career soldier to become governor-general.

Jeffrey has represented Australia at multiple royal weddings, including the Wedding of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson and the Wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.

In 2005, Jeffery became a co-patron of the private, non-profit Australia China Friendship and Exchange Association (ACFEA), founded by Chinese-Australian businessman Chau Chak Wing. The organization promoted bilateral and international dialogue, particularly between China and Australia, having established the annual Imperial Springs International Forum in 2014.

On 8 April 2005, Jeffery represented Australia at the funeral of Pope John Paul II.

In 2007, in his position as governor-general, Jeffery was appointed as the colonel-in-chief of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps, succeeding the previous colonel-in-chief, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Jeffery was the Chief Scout of Australia.

Jeffery left Yarralumla prior to the swearing-in of his successor, Quentin Bryce, the former Governor of Queensland. Bryce was sworn in on 5 September 2008.

===Career after office===
On 23 October 2012, at the National Farmers&#x27; Federation Congress in Canberra, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the appointment of Jeffery as Australia&#x27;s first Advocate for Soil Health. Gillard noted that, as Governor-General, Jeffery had a passion for regional development and the future of our rural industries, a commitment he continued after leaving office. 
Prime Minister Tony Abbott extended Jeffery&#x27;s appointment as the national Advocate for Soil Health until December 2014, indicating Jeffery would continue to raise public awareness of the role soil plays in underpinning sustainable productivity, delivering quality ecosystem services and helping to meet global challenges including food security and climate change.

In June 2020, Jeffery stepped down from this role, now the Patron of the Soil Cooperative Research Centre, due to illness.

==Honours and awards==

==Personal life==
Jeffery was a Christian. He died on 18 December 2020, at the age of 83.

<doc id="251099" wikidata="Q1777087" url="?curid=251099" title="Captain Corelli's Mandolin">
<text>Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin, released simultaneously in the United States as Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin, is a 1994 novel by the British writer Louis de Bernières, set on the Greek island of Cephalonia during the Italian and German occupation of the Second World War. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 19 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

==Synopsis==
Dr. Iannis resides on the Greek island of Cephalonia with his daughter Pelagia, who has acquired medical knowledge through her observations of her father&#x27;s practice. Pelagia becomes romantically involved with a young fisherman named Mandras, and they become engaged just as World War II breaks out. Mandras decides to join the fight on the front lines, leaving Pelagia anxiously awaiting his letters, which never arrive. Meanwhile, Carlo Guercio, a closeted homosexual, fights alongside the Italian forces invading Albania and witnesses the tragic death of his beloved Francesco, for whom he harbors deep affection, at the hands of the Greek army.

In 1941, Italian and German soldiers are posted to Cephalonia, where they are ostracized by the locals. Pelagia is determined to hate them, especially when a young captain named Antonio Corelli is domiciled with her. Mandras comes home from the war and Pelagia realizes she no longer loves him. Mandras leaves for the Greek mainland, where he joins the communist partisan organisation ELAS. But this Greek resistance group is cruel towards the civilian population and frequently attacks other partisan groups for being ideologically no different than the Axis&#x27;s occupying forces.

When Italy surrenders, their former German allies turn on them. After defeating the Italian division, the German soldiers on Cephalonia carry out a massive execution. Corelli&#x27;s life is saved by Carlo Guercio, who shields him with his body when they face execution by firing squad. Guercio dies, and the wounded Corelli is aided by a Greek back to Pelagia&#x27;s house. Corelli has to stay hidden from the Germans, whose orders are to kill any surviving Italians.

As soon as he is well enough, Corelli escapes to Italy, promising Pelagia that he will return as soon as the war ends and then they will be married. Corelli leaves &quot;Antonia,&quot; his mandolin, with Pelagia for safekeeping.

The war eventually ends and communists take over the island. Dr Iannis is considered an intellectual, therefore suspect, and is sent to a camp along with some of his friends, who protest against his treatment. Mandras returns, having learned to read, indoctrinated with Communist ideologies. He has read Pelagia&#x27;s letters and knows that she does not love him, so he tries unsuccessfully to rape her. Mandras&#x27; mother realizes what almost happened and repudiates her own son. Ashamed, he commits suicide. Mandras&#x27; mother comforts Pelagia and remains close with Pelagia for the remainder of her life.

Some time after, a baby girl is left on Pelagia&#x27;s doorstep, who Pelagia adopts. Dr Iannis comes home, traumatised. The baby girl, whom Pelagia has named Antonia, grows up and marries. Antonia later has a son who is named Iannis in honor of the doctor.

Many years later, Corelli, now a famous mandolin player, visits Pelagia one last time.

==Real story and precedents==
Bernières has denied that the character of Corelli is based on who was then an Italian artillery captain in Cephalonia, despite the many similarities in their stories. Pampaloni survived execution, joined the Greek People&#x27;s Liberation Army, the Partisans in the Greek civil war, and fought with them in Epirus for fourteen months. Pampaloni was interviewed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 2000 and expressed the view that the novel misrepresented the Greek partisan movement.

The novel also shows some similarities to &quot;Bandiera bianca a Cefalonia&quot;, a novel by published in 1963, translated in English as &quot;The White Flag&quot; (1969).

==Reception==
The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; called &quot;Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin&quot; a &quot;radically traditionalist&quot; novel, &quot;a good nourishing tale full of true things, historical and psychological, spiced with opinion and contrariness, with not one dollop of regard for artistic fashion.&quot;

The &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; praised the multiple emotional levels of the novel, remarking, &quot;Like Puccini, de Bernières can evoke golden narrative, full of both pain and gladness.&quot;

Gene Hyde wrote, &quot;To defy Sisyphus and rebel against the absurd, especially in the face of war, is an excruciatingly difficult and noble task. The beauty of Bernières&#x27; unique and deeply moving novel is his insistence that our hope lies in these seemingly quixotic impulses.&quot;

==Awards==
* 1995 – Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best Book
* 2003 – 19th place on The Big Read

<text>&quot;Druk Tsenden&quot; (, ; &quot;The Thunder Dragon Kingdom&quot;) is the national anthem of Bhutan. Adopted in 1953, the lyrics were written by Dolop Droep Namgay and possibly translated into English by Dasho Gyaldun Thinley. The accompanying music was composed by Aku Tongmi.

==History==
Despite claims made in Brozović&#x27;s &quot;Enciklopedija&quot; (1999) and many subsequent authors, who attribute the authorship of the national anthem to Gyaldun Thinley, father of the former Prime Minister Jigme Thinley, there are many who believe that the words and the national anthem itself were penned by &quot;Dorji Lopen&quot; Dolop Droep Namgay of Talo, Punakha. The &quot;Dorji Lopen&quot; is the most senior of the four senior Lopens in Bhutan&#x27;s religious establishment, and often serves as the Deputy Je Khenpo. Dolop Droep Namgay maintained close personal and working relations with the third King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, during whose reign Gyaldun Thinley served in various capacities.

It is possible that Gyaldun Thinley may have been involved in working closely with Dolop Droep Namgay and translating the lyrics into English. It is also highly likely that he (and/or his son Jigme Thinley who served in many important government and political capacities since the 1990s) was one of the persons of first contact for Dalibor Brozović who attributed Gyaldun Thinley as the author of the lyrics; however, many regard Dolop Droep Namgay as the author.

Aku Tongmi was educated in Shillong, India and had recently been appointed leader of the military brass band when the need for an anthem rose at the occasion of a state visit from the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. His original score was inspired by the Bhutanese folk tune &quot;The Unchanging Lotus Throne&quot; (). The melody has twice undergone changes by Tongmi&#x27;s successors as band leaders. The original lyrics were 12 lines, but were shortened to the present six-line version in 1964 by a secretary to the king.

As the anthem is inspired by a folk tune, there is a choreography to it as well, originally directed by Tongmi.

In 1953, His majesty the king Jigme Dorji Wangchuk ordered to compose a national anthem for Bhutan. So, the lyrics, choreography and tune were then composed taking the national anthem of England and India as a references.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics to the national anthem are inscribed in the Constitution of Bhutan.

<text>The national anthem of Bolivia (), also known by its incipit &quot;Bolivians, the Propitious Fate&quot; () and by its original title &quot;Patriotic Song&quot; (), was adopted in 1851. José Ignacio de Sanjinés, a signer of both the Bolivian Declaration of Independence and the first Bolivian Constitution, wrote the lyrics. The music was composed by an Italian, Leopoldo Benedetto Vincenti.

It is a march in 4/4 time, although it is popularly sung in 12/8. It was premiered in the city of La Paz, in front of the Palacio de Gobierno, at noon on 18 November 1845, by about 90 instrumentalists belonging to the military bands of the 5th, 6th and 8th battalions. That day, the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Ingavi was celebrated with several acts of extraordinary magnitude, a highlight of which was the opening of the .

In 1851, during the government of General Manuel Isidoro Belzu, the national anthem of Bolivia was made official by a supreme decree. It was then printed for distribution in schools. It has since been performed and sung in all official school functions.

== History ==
=== Background ===
In the city of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre) in 1835, the composition called &quot;&quot; (&quot;National March&quot;) came to light, the first national anthem, the work of the Peruvian teacher Pedro Ximénez Abril Tirado, who was the chapelmaster of Chuquisaca Cathedral. This composition did not become official, quite possibly due to the creation, organization and subsequent elimination of the Peru–Bolivian Confederation (1836–1839).

The original scores are found in the Historical Archive of Chuquisaca Cathedral, where they are part of the musical heritage of Bolivia. A piano performance, performed by the teacher María Antonieta García Meza de Pacheco, exists in a compilation on CD as a tribute to the work of Ximenez Abrill Tirado.

=== National anthem ===
Once the independence and sovereignty of Bolivia were consolidated in the Battle of Ingavi on 18 November 1841, the need for a patriotic song was noted again because General José Ballivián, then president of Bolivia, noted that small bands of the Army were not managing to conquer popular fervor by performing inherited Spanish marches and popular pieces.

It was under these circumstances that Ballivián learned of the visit to Chile of Italian teacher and composer Leopoldo Benedetto Vincenti, whom he invited in 1844 to exercise the position of general director of bands of the Bolivian army and to compose, under contract, the music of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Patriotic Song&quot;), under which name it was to be known at the time. Vincenti arrived in La Paz in September 1844 and found the musical bands in a dire state, as could be established in his family letters. His work was exhausting; many times, he went to bed dressed to go to the barracks at dawn. The trials were long and pressing. Vincenti rejected one text after another; it was then that lawyer and poet José Ignacio Sanjinéz presented him with the verses of what is now the Bolivian national anthem, originally written in Spanish.

In the La Paz Plaza Murillo at noon on 18 November 1845, after Te Deum was performed at the Cathedral of La Paz in honor of the Battle of Ingavi, the military bands of the Battalions 5th, 6th and 8th played, for the first time, the chords of the Bolivian national anthem. Ballivián came out excited to one of the balconies of the Palacio Quemado, profusely congratulating the performance.

That same night, simultaneously, the was premiered in a lyrical-musical program, a central part of which was the interpretation of the &quot;&quot;. The new theatre was packed: the president of the republic, José Ballivián, attended with his cabinet; prefectural, municipal, and public authorities gathered.

==Lyrics==
The first verse and chorus are usually performed at official events. If brevity is required, only the chorus may be performed.

<text>The National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina was composed in 1998 by Dušan Šestić and was adopted provisionally in 1999, before being made official in 2001. It has no official lyrics, though unofficial lyrics have been written for it.

Following the Dayton Agreement that ended the Bosnian War in the mid-1990s, Bosnian state symbols were mandated to be inclusive of the country&#x27;s main ethnic groups and not make any overt references to a specific one. The Bosnian national anthem that was in use at the time was considered to be insufficiently inclusive towards all of the country&#x27;s ethnic groups and thus the United Nations, which oversaw the country as part of the Dayton Agreement, decided to replace it with an instrumental one, which was considered by it to be more inclusive. In the two decades since its inception, various attempts have been made to adopt lyrics for it, most recently in 2018, but due to political disagreements, none have been successful as yet.

The Bosnian and Herzegovinian anthem is one of very few national anthems to be protected under copyright. The copyright to the anthem is owned by the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==
===Background===
The national anthem was adopted provisionally by the UN&#x27;s High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina on 25 June 1999 by the promulgation of the Law on the National Anthem of Bosnia and Herzegovina, replacing the previous national anthem, &quot;Jedna si jedina&quot;, which was not particularly well-liked the country&#x27;s Serb and Croat communities. The Bosnian government itself formally adopted it in 2001, and it has reportedly been in use along with the flag and coat of arms since 10 February 1998.

Bosnian Serb composer Dušan Šestić from Banja Luka composed the melody, to which initially there were no lyrics under the working title &quot;Intermeco&quot; (&quot;Intermezzo&quot;), which is commonly referred to as its title although it was never officially adopted as such. Šestić was denounced by some Serbs who disliked that he had written the national anthem of a state whose existence they were opposed to, whereas some Croats and Bosniaks disliked that a Serb had composed the national anthem as opposed to a member of their ethnicity.

Due to its length, an abridged version omitting several bars near the middle of the piece is often played at occasions requiring brevity.

==Lyrics==
Since 2007, various attempts have been made to have lyrics adopted for the Bosnian national anthem. Lyrics written by Šestić, the original composer, and Benjamin Isović were proposed in June 2008 and accepted by a parliamentary commission in February 2009. The 2008 lyrics emphasize national unity and a focus on the future, rather than emphasizing the past or ethnic differences. Though he was reportedly supposed to be paid 17,000 Euros by the state split with Isović for his role in writing new lyrics, Šestić had not yet received compensation as of 2015. The decision still requires approval of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The proposed lyrics do not mention the two administrative entities or the constitutional nations that make up the state, leading to some opposition, and end with the line &quot;We are going into the future, together!&quot;. As part of the consideration process, a recording of the lyrics was sung for a government committee by Dragica Panić Kašanski, a musicologist.

A lyrical adoption was again proposed in 2016, but those were not approved either. In February 2018, a renewed effort for an adoption of lyrics was initiated, though due to the ethnically-fragmented nature of Bosnian politics, it is unlikely to succeed in light of several other similar attempts being made and never approved. Some have suggested using the words from the Serbo-Croatian poem &quot;Emina&quot; as the lyrics for the national anthem, due to its connection to Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs alike.

===Proposed lyrics===
==Reception==
According to a 2011 survey conducted of the Bosnian population, Bosnians&#x27; attitudes towards their country&#x27;s national anthem were shown to be sharply split along ethnic lines, with Bosniaks generally liking the national anthem, Croats being ambivalent towards it, and Serbs overwhelmingly disliking it, even booing it at some performances, refusing to stand for it, and displaying three-fingered salutes. In some cases, the Bosnian and Herzegovinian national anthem is not played in Republika Srpska even at events where others are played.

=== Controversy ===
In the late 2000s, commentators noted an aesthetic similarity of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian national anthem to Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s instrumental piece &quot;Faber College Theme&quot; that serves as the introductory music to the 1978 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, leading to accusations of plagiarism and calls for the composition to be replaced as a result. The composer Dušan Šestić defended himself against accusations of plagiarism, saying that he could not have plagiarized Bernstein&#x27;s work as he was unaware of the latter&#x27;s composition.

<text>Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke, GCB, PC (4 December 1811 – 27 July 1892), British , was a pivotal conservative spokesman who helped shape British politics in the latter half of the 19th century. He held office under William Ewart Gladstone as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1868 and 1873 and as Home Secretary between 1873 and 1874. Lowe is remembered for his work in education policy, his opposition to electoral reform and his contribution to modern UK company law. Gladstone appointed Lowe as Chancellor expecting him to hold down public spending. Public spending rose, and Gladstone pronounced Lowe &quot;wretchedly deficient&quot;; most historians agree. Lowe repeatedly underestimated the revenue, enabling him to resist demands for tax cuts and to reduce the national debt instead. He insisted that the tax system be fair to all classes. By his own main criterion of fairness — that the balance between direct and indirect taxation remain unchanged — he succeeded. Even in his time, however, this concept of fiscal incidence was obsolescent.

== Early life ==
Lowe was born in Bingham, Nottinghamshire, England, the second son of the Reverend Robert Lowe (rector of St Mary and All Saints, Bingham). His mother was Ellen, the daughter of the Rev. Reginald Pyndar. Lowe had albinism, and his sight was so weak that initially it was thought he was unfit to be sent to school.

In 1822, he went to a school at Southwell, then Latin House, Risley, and in 1825 to Winchester as a commoner. In Lowe&#x27;s fragment of autobiography he shows an unpleasing picture of the under-feeding and other conditions of the school life of the time. The languages of Latin and Greek were the main subjects of study and Lowe records that both were easy for him.

Lowe then attended University College, Oxford, and enjoyed the change; there as a pupil of Benjamin Jowett he gained a first class degree in Literae Humaniores and a second class in mathematics, besides taking a leading part in the Union debates.

In 1835, he won a fellowship at Magdalen, but vacated it on marrying, on 26 March 1836, Georgiana Orred (d. 1884). Lowe was for a few years a successful tutor at Oxford, but in 1838 was disappointed at not being elected to the professorship of Greek at the University of Glasgow.

==Australia==
In 1841 Lowe moved to London to read for the Bar, but his eyesight showed signs of serious weakness, and, acting on medical advice, he sailed to Sydney in the colony of New South Wales, where he set to work in the law courts. On 7 November 1843 he was nominated by Sir George Gipps, the Governor of New South Wales, to a seat in the New South Wales Legislative Council replacing Robert Jones who had to resign from the Council due to insolvency.

Owing to a difference of opinion with Gipps, Lowe resigned from the council on 9 September 1844, but was elected in April 1845 for Counties of St Vincent and Auckland. Lowe held that seat until 20 June 1848 and was elected for City of Sydney in July 1848, a seat he held until November 1849.

Lowe soon made his mark in the political world by his clever speeches, particularly on finance and education; and besides obtaining a large legal practice, he was involved with the founding and was one of the principal writers for the &quot;Atlas&quot; newspaper.

In 1844, Lowe defended a Royal Navy captain, John Knatchbull, on a charge of murdering a widowed shopkeeper named Ellen Jamieson; he was one of the earliest to raise in a British court the plea of moral insanity (unsuccessfully). Knatchbull was hanged on 13 February 1844. Lowe and his wife adopted Mrs. Jamieson&#x27;s two orphaned children, Bobby and Polly Jamieson.

On 27 January 1850, the Lowes and the two Jamieson children sailed to England.

==British politics==
===Early years===
Lowe&#x27;s previous university reputation and connections combined with his colonial experience stood him in good stead; &quot;The Times&quot; was glad to employ him, and, as one of its ablest leader-writers, he made his influence widely felt. In 1852, he was returned to Parliament for Kidderminster in the Liberal interest. In the House of Commons, his acute reasoning made a considerable impression, and, under successive Liberal ministries (1853–1858), he obtained official experience as Secretary to the Board of Control and Vice-President of the Board of Trade. During his time there, he saw the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 passed – the first nationwide codification of company law in the world. He has been referred to as &quot;the father of modern company law&quot;. This status was again referred to in the presentation by Lord Sainsbury of the second reading leading up to the new United Kingdom Companies Act 2006:
&quot;One hundred and fifty years ago, my predecessor Robert Lowe, later First Viscount Sherbrooke, brought forward the Bill that created the joint stock limited liability company. It was the first nationwide codification of company law in the world, and he has recently been described as &quot;the father of modern company law&quot;. Our company law continues to have an excellent record. Since 1997 new incorporations have risen by over 60 per cent and the number of foreign firms incorporating in the UK has more than quadrupled. No doubt this is because, according to the World Bank&#x27;s assessment, it is quicker and cheaper for companies to set up in the UK than in any other EU member state.&quot;

In 1859, Lowe went to the Education Office as Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education in Lord Palmerston&#x27;s ministry; there he pursued a vigorous policy, insisting on payment by results, and bringing in the revised code (1862), which embodied this principle and made an examination in &quot;the three R&#x27;s&quot; the test for grants of public money. He felt then, and still more after the Reform Act of 1867, that &quot;we must educate our masters,&quot; and he rather scandalized his old university friends by the stress he laid on physical science as opposed to classical studies. Considerable opposition was aroused by the new regime at the Education Office, and, in 1864, Lowe was driven to resign by an adverse vote in Parliament with reference to the way in which inspectors&#x27; reports were &quot;edited.&quot; This was the result of the strong feelings that had been aroused against Lingen&#x27;s administration of the Education Office.

=== Reform ===

Lord Palmerston had been a towering opponent to widening democratic participation and his death in October 1865 opened the way to the Russell–Gladstone reform ministry, which introduced the Reform Bill of 1866. Lowe carried on his former Prime Minister&#x27;s views, as part of the Canning and Peel Liberal school. Moreover, he had been heavily shocked by his experiences of the comparatively developed union movement in his time in Australia in a less rigid class system. He had already made known his objections to the advance of &quot;democracy&quot;, notably in his speech in 1865 on Sir Edward Baines&#x27;s Borough Franchise Bill. He was not invited to join the new ministry. Lowe retired into what Bright called the &quot;Cave of Adullam&quot;, and with other Liberals and Whig peers (known collectively as the &#x27;Adullamites&#x27; ) opposed the bill in a series of brilliant speeches, which raised his reputation as an orator to its highest point and helped to cause government&#x27;s downfall.

However, Benjamin Disraeli who led the subsequent Conservative government proposed his own Reform Bill, which by splitting the parties succeeded to become the Reform Act 1867. As he said in the third reading of the Bill, Lowe thought any step towards democracy was bad because it engendered &quot;a right existing in the individual as opposed to general expediency… numbers as against wealth and intellect&quot;. So the bill contained &quot;the terms of endless agitation&quot;.

Proponents of the Bill argued a lower property qualification would give the vote to respectable members of the working class. But Lowe thought:
Being a man of company law, Robert Lowe saw unions as a threat to the order, which as he drafted, allowed only for social participation through investment of capital, not investment of labour. As it was the case that participation in Parliament was also only possible through possession of property, Lowe was fearful that a change in one part of the world he understood would lead to another, ending in unforeseeable chaos.

Lowe concluded his speech with considerable flair.

=== Gladstone Ministry ===
In spite of the fact that his appeals did not prevent the passing of the Second Reform Act, Robert Lowe beat Walter Bagehot in the next election to become the first Member of Parliament (MP) for the London University, a new constituency created by the very Act he opposed. In 1868 he accepted office in the Gladstone Cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer, an office that he described in the following terms in the House of Commons on 11 April 1870: &quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man whose duties make him more or less of a taxing machine. He is entrusted with a certain amount of misery which it is his duty to distribute as fairly as he can.&quot;

Lowe was a rather cut-and-dried economist, who prided himself that during his four years of office he took twelve millions off taxation; but later opinion has hardly accepted his removal of the shilling registration duty on corn (1869) as good statesmanship, and his failures are remembered rather than his successes. His proposed tax of a halfpenny a box on Lucifer matches in 1871 (for which he suggested the epigram &quot;ex luce lucellum&quot;, &quot;out of light a little profit&quot;) roused a storm of opposition, and had to be dropped. In 1873 he was transferred to the Home Office, but in 1874 the government resigned.

==Later years==
Lowe spoke against the Royal Titles Bill 1876 at East Retford and implied that Queen Victoria had been responsible for the bill&#x27;s introduction. As a result, when the Liberals returned to power in 1880, Victoria made it clear that she would not accept any ministry that included Lowe. Nevertheless, he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Sherbrooke, of Sherbrooke in the County of Surrey (a peerage that would become extinct on his death), against the express wishes of Queen Victoria, but with the backing of William Gladstone. In 1885, he was also further honoured by being created Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath. But from 1875 till his death at Warlingham, Surrey, his health was constantly failing, and by degrees he figured less and less in public life. He became a supporter of the Liberal Unionist party in 1886.

During the 1870s the following epitaph was suggested for him by one of the wits of his day:

Here lies poor old Robert Lowe;
Where he&#x27;s gone to I don&#x27;t know;
If to the realms of peace and love,
Farewell to happiness above;
If, haply, to some lower level,
We can&#x27;t congratulate the devil.
Lowe was delighted with this, and promptly translated it into Latin, as follows:

Continentur hac in fossa
Humilis Roberti ossa;
Si ad coelum evolabit,
Pax in coelo non restabit;
Sin in inferis jacebit,
Diabolum ejus poenitebit.
On his death he was buried in Brookwood Cemetery.

== Australian federal electoral division ==
The Division of Lowe, a now abolished Australian electoral division located in Sydney, was named after him.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;Blessed Be This Noble Land&quot;) is the national anthem of Botswana. The music was composed by Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, who also authored the song&#x27;s Setswana lyrics. It was adopted when the country became independent in 1966. Since independence, the song is sung occasionally during the country&#x27;s important events such as Kgotla meetings, independence celebrations and other national events. The national anthem is highly respected to an extent that when it is sung movements are not allowed, people stand at attention, and security officers, like the police and soldiers, salute as a show of respect.

==History==
From the late 19th-century until the height of decolonisation during the 1960s, Bechuanaland (as it was then known) was a protectorate of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire. In the run up to independence, proposals for the national symbols for the future country were made. Although the flag and the coat of arms were straightforward choices, the selection of the national anthem became a source of contention. Despite its popularity, &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; was reportedly not the frontrunner because its composer – Kgalemang Tumediso Motsete, who possessed &quot;a music degree from London&quot; – was the co-founder and leader of the opposition Botswana People&#x27;s Party (BPP), which at the time was a radical faction. Instead, the government wanted to maintain &quot;Morena boloka Sechaba sa Etsho&quot; (&quot;Lord protect the nation of the world&quot;) as the anthem after independence. Although the latter song was considered by some government officials to be a &quot;colonial song&quot;, it was in fact embraced by nationalists in the south of the continent in their struggle against colonialism, as well as in South Africa during the apartheid era.
In an interview with the national newspaper &quot;Mmegi&quot;, fellow BPP co-founder Motsamai Mpho stated that &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; was written in 1962. He stated that Motsete had penned the anthem in Ghana, where he was inspired by the songs of liberation from that country. Indeed, Mpho asserts that himself, Motsete, and three others affiliated with the BPP were the first people to sing the anthem while returning home on a flight from a Pan-Africanist conference held in Accra that same year.

According to the biographer of Gobe Matenge, a former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs, he was one of several civil servants – including the future vice president Peter Mmusi – that compelled the Motswana government to adopt &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; as the anthem of the independent nation. In order to ascertain the opinion of the general public on the matter, the government transmitted all of the contending hymns over Radio Botswana. However, Matenge&#x27;s group was able to obtain recordings of these songs for themselves and air them in front of quasi-town hall gatherings held in major settlements like Lobatse, Molepolole, and Mafikeng, in addition to the capital Gaborone. They strategically played &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; as the last song – which in theory would increase the likelihood that the audience would remember the tune – while having their organisers add words of praise for it in an attempt to sway the crowd&#x27;s opinion in favour of that hymn. At the end of the exercise, they would circulate a boilerplate form letter articulating the author&#x27;s viewpoint of &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; being their favourite candidate for national anthem. This was done because of the low levels of literacy in Botswana at the time. Of the multitude of letters sent to the Department of Information and Broadcasting, the vast majority of them expressed an inclination towards the aforementioned song.

However, this account has been disputed by George Winstanley, the first clerk to the Cabinet after independence. He insists that stories about how the government was pressured into ratifying &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; are simply inaccurate, especially in light of the fact that the civil servants who supposedly did this were merely &quot;junior executive officers&quot; at the time. Rather, Winstanley remembers how Seretse Khama initially leaned towards selecting &quot;Morena&quot; (&quot;Lord keep the nation of the world&quot;), before he convinced Khama to select a hymn that was &quot;unique to Botswana&quot;. Khama&#x27;s deputy Quett Masire recalled how the future president wanted an anthem that was enduring and would transcend the political spectrum, so that it would not be changed when another political party assumed power in the future.

A total of seven hymns were shortlisted as finalists for the new national anthem. Motsete actually made another submission – &quot;Botswana Fatshe le Lentle&quot; (meaning &quot;Botswana, a Beautiful Country&quot;) – in addition to &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot;; the two compositions finished runner-up and winner, respectively. The latter was officially adopted in 1966, the year the country gained independence. One of the first public occasions where the anthem was played was at the flag hoisting ceremony at midnight on 30 September 1966, marking the end of British rule over Botswana.

===Modern day===
The anthem is normally sung in four part vocal harmony. It is performed at events, both at tribal and at national level. For instance, it is sung before traditional village meetings &quot;(kgotla&quot;).

==Lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;Fatshe leno la rona&quot; alludes to God and his standing as the bestower of the nation&#x27;s land. It also promotes values such as love of the country, and accord among the different ethnic groups residing in the state. The author is saying that this land is a gift from our forefathers and pleads that it must remain peaceful. He further suggests that the people of Botswana should work collectively to build up the nation, both men and women. He does not only call for cooperation but also commitment. Finally, the song echoes how beautiful the name Botswana is, expressly noting that this beauty is from the unity and stability of Botswana.

A usual rendition of the anthem consists of the first verse followed by the chorus; however the second verse and chorus may also be performed as well.

Kamphaeng Phet was already a royal city in the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 14th century, then known under its old name &quot;Chakangrao&quot;. It formed an important part of the defence system of the kingdom, as well as of the later Ayutthaya Kingdom.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the city walls surmounted by diamonds, since the city name means &#x27;diamond wall&#x27; (from the shape of the ramparts of the old city wall). The provincial tree is the areca nut palm (&quot;Acacia catechu&quot;), and the provincial flower the bullet wood (&quot;Mimusops elengi&quot;). Golden belly barb (&quot;Hypsibarbus wetmorei&quot;) is provincial fish, since it is a fish found in the Ping river especially in the area of Kamphaeng Phet.
==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 11 districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). These are further divided into 78 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 823 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Kamphaeng Phet Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 25 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Kamphaeng Phet, Pang Makha and Nong Pling have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 22 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 64 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="251117" wikidata="Q231618" url="?curid=251117" title="Carolyn S. Shoemaker">
<text>Carolyn Jean Spellmann Shoemaker (June 24, 1929 – August 13, 2021) was an American astronomer and a co-discoverer of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. She discovered 32 comets (then a record for the most by an individual) and more than 500 asteroids.

Having earned degrees in history, political science, and English literature, she had little interest in planetary science until she met and married geologist Eugene Merle Shoemaker. Her career in astronomy began when she demonstrated good stereoscopic vision, a particularly valuable quality for looking for objects in near-Earth space. Despite the fact that her degrees were not in science, having that visual ability motivated the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to hire her as a research assistant on a team led by her husband. She went on to making record-setting discoveries in the field of astronomy, as well as being awarded honorary degrees and many professional awards.

== Personal life ==
Shoemaker was born on June 24, 1929, in Gallup, New Mexico, to Hazel and Leonard Spellmann. Her family then moved to Chico, California, where she and her brother Richard grew up. She earned bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in history, political science, and English literature from Chico State.

When her brother attended Caltech, his roommate was a young graduate student named Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Shoemaker. Carolyn first met him in the summer of 1950 at her brother&#x27;s wedding. After graduating, Shoemaker had moved to New Jersey to begin work toward his doctoral degree at Princeton University. He had flown back to California to serve as Richard&#x27;s best man. When Shoemaker returned to his studies at Princeton, Carolyn and he maintained a pen pal relationship and later both attended a two-week camping trip on the Cumberland Plateau. They were married on August 18, 1951 and had three children: Christy, Linda, and Patrick (Pat).

The Shoemaker family lived in Grand Junction, Colorado, Menlo Park, California, and Pasadena, California, before settling down in Flagstaff, Arizona, where she and her husband worked together at the Lowell Observatory. In 1997, Carolyn and Gene were involved in a car crash in Australia. Gene was killed instantly, while Carolyn sustained severe injuries.

Shoemaker died at age 92, after a fall on August 13, 2021.

== Careers ==

Shortly after her marriage, the first job she held was teaching the seventh grade. Unsatisfied with the teaching profession, she quit to raise a family. Mary Chapman, author of Shoemaker&#x27;s biography for the USGS Astrogeology Center, wrote &quot;Carolyn is a warm, caring, and extremely patient woman, but her skills were better suited for a non-teaching environment.&quot; After her children had grown up and moved out, Shoemaker sought work. In her youth, she had never been interested in scientific topics. She had taken one course in geology, but found it extremely boring. However, she reportedly told others that, &quot;listening to Gene explaining geology made what she had thought was a boring subject into an exciting and interesting pursuit of knowledge&quot;.

At the suggestion of her husband, she began studying astronomy from a student at Lowell Observatory. Then she began working as a field assistant for her husband. She worked on his search program mapping and analyzing impact craters.

Carolyn Shoemaker started her astronomical career in 1980, at age 51, searching for Earth-crossing asteroids and comets at California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, and the Palomar Observatory, San Diego, California. That year, Shoemaker was hired at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as a visiting scientist in the astronomy branch, and then in 1989 began work as an astronomy research professor at Northern Arizona University. She concentrated her work on searching for comets and planet-crossing asteroids. Teamed with astronomer David H. Levy, the Shoemakers identified Shoemaker-Levy 9, a fragmented comet with an orbit that intersected that of Jupiter, on March 24, 1993.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Shoemaker used film taken at the wide-field telescope at the Palomar Observatory, combined with a stereoscope, to find objects that moved against the background of fixed stars.

Following recovery from the injuries she suffered in the 1997 automobile crash in which her husband was killed, she resumed her work at the Lowell Observatory with Levy. She was actively involved in astronomical observation work until at least 2002. Shoemaker had been credited with discovering or co-discovering 32 comets and over 500 asteroids.

== Awards and honors ==
The Hildian asteroid 4446 Carolyn, discovered by colleague Edward Bowell at Lowell Observatory in 1985, was named in her honor. In 1988, Shoemaker received the Rittenhouse Medal of the Rittenhouse Astronomical Society. In 1995, she received the Scientist of the Year Award, also from the Rittenhouse Astronomical Society.

In 1996, Shoemaker received an honorary doctorate degree from the Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal. In 1998, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences named both of the Shoemakers as the recipients of the James Craig Watson Medal.

The Carolyn Shoemaker formation within Gale crater, forms part of the broader Mount Sharp group was named after her. The formation is the layer of rocks that forms the strata within Glen Torridon - the layer of phyllosilicate rocks which was one of the primary objectives of the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity during its ascent of Aeolis Mons.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
 Shoemaker is tied with Takeshi Urata for place on the Minor Planet Center&#x27;s list of most discoveries with 377 numbered minor planets between the years 1980 and 1994.

<doc id="251118" wikidata="Q134654" url="?curid=251118" title="Brazilian National Anthem">
<text>The &quot;Brazilian National Anthem&quot; () was composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva in 1831 and had been given at least two sets of unofficial lyrics before a 1922 decree by president Epitácio Pessoa gave the anthem its definitive, official lyrics, by Joaquim Osório Duque-Estrada, after several changes were made to his proposal, written in 1909.

The lyrics have been described as Parnassian in style and Romantic in content.

==History==

The melody of the Brazilian national anthem was composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva, and was presented to the public for the first time in April 1831. On 7 April 1831, the first Brazilian Emperor, Pedro I, abdicated the Crown and days later left for Europe, leaving behind the then-five-year-old Emperor Pedro II.

From the Brazilian proclamation of independence in 1822 until the 1831 abdication, an anthem that had been composed by Pedro I himself, celebrating the country&#x27;s independence (and that now continues to be an official patriotic song, the Independence Anthem), was used as the national anthem. In the immediate aftermath of the abdication of Pedro I, the anthem composed by him fell in popularity.

Francisco Manuel da Silva then seized this opportunity to present his composition, and the anthem written by him was played in public for the first time on 13 April 1831. On that same day, the ship carrying the former Emperor left the port of Rio de Janeiro. The date of April 13 now appears in official calendars as the &quot;Day of the Brazilian National Anthem&quot;.

As to the actual date of composition of the music presented in April 1831, there is controversy among historians. Some hold that Francisco Manuel da Silva composed the music in the last four months of 1822 to commemorate Brazil&#x27;s independence (declared on 7 September 1822), others hold that the hymn was written in early 1823 and others consider the evidence of composition dating back to 1822 or 1823 unreliable, and hold that the Anthem presented on 13 April 1831 was written in 1831, and not before. In any event, the Anthem remained in obscurity until it was played in public on 13 April 1831. In style, the music resembles early Romantic Italian music such as that of Gioachino Rossini.

Initially, the music composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva was given lyrics by Appeals Judge Ovídio Saraiva de Carvalho e Silva not as a national anthem, but as a hymn commemorating the abdication of Pedro I and the accession of Pedro II to the Throne. It was known during this early period as &quot;April 7 Hymn&quot;. The lyrics by Ovídio Saraiva soon fell out of use, given that they were considered poor, and even offensive towards the Portuguese. The music, however, continued enjoying sustained popularity and by 1837 it was played, without lyrics, in all public ceremonies.

Although no statute was passed during the imperial period to declare Francisco Manuel da Silva&#x27;s musical composition as the national anthem, no formal enactment was considered necessary for the adoption of a national anthem. A national anthem was seen as resulting from praxis or tradition. Thus, by 1837, when it was played in all official solemnities, Francisco Manuel da Silva&#x27;s composition was already the &quot;de facto&quot; Brazilian National Anthem.

A new set of lyrics was proposed in 1841, to commemorate the coming of age and Coronation of Emperor Pedro II; those lyrics, popular but also considered poor, were soon abandoned as well, this time by order of Emperor Pedro II, who specified that in public ceremonies the anthem should be played with no lyrics. Emperor Pedro II directed that Francisco Manuel da Silva&#x27;s composition, as the national anthem of the Empire of Brazil, should be played, without lyrics, on all occasions when the monarch presented himself in public, and in solemnities of military or civilian nature; the composition was also played abroad in diplomatic events relating to Brazil or when the Brazilian Emperor was present.

During the Empire of Brazil era, the U.S. composer and pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk, then residing in Rio de Janeiro, composed two nationalistic works of classical music based on the Brazilian National Anthem that achieved great popularity at the time: the &quot;Brazilian Solemn March&quot; (&quot;Marcha Solene Brasileira&quot;, in the modern Portuguese spelling or &quot;Marcha Solemne Brazileira&quot;, in the original spelling in force at the time of composition) and the &quot;Great Triumphal Fantasy on the Brazilian National Anthem&quot; (&quot;Grande Fantasia Triunfal sobre o Hino Nacional Brasileiro&quot;). The former was dedicated to Emperor Pedro II, and the latter was dedicated to his heiress presumptive, the Princess Imperial Isabel. Those works are in the vein of similar compositions written at the time in other nations, such as Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Fantasy on the Russian National Anthem&quot;. The &quot;Grand Triumphal Fantasy&quot;, long forgotten, resurfaced in popularity in 1985, at the dawn of Brazil&#x27;s New Republic, during the country&#x27;s re-democratization process after the military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985, when it was played to accompany the funeral cortège of president-elect Tancredo Neves.

After the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889, the new republican rulers held a contest in order to choose a new anthem; the contest was won by Leopoldo Miguez, with lyrics by Medeiros e Albuquerque. After protests against the adoption of the proposed new anthem, however, the head of the Provisional Government, Deodoro da Fonseca, formalized Francisco Manuel da Silva&#x27;s composition as the national anthem, while the composition by Miguez and Medeiros e Albuquerque was declared the Anthem of the Proclamation of the Republic. Deodoro himself was said to prefer the old anthem to the new composition. The Decree of the Provisional Government (Decree No. 171 of 1890) confirming Francisco Manuel da Silva&#x27;s composition, that had served as the National Anthem of the Empire of Brazil, as the National Anthem of the new Republic, was issued on 20 January 1890.

In the early days of the new Federal Republic, the National Anthem continued without official lyrics, but several lyrics were proposed, and some were even adopted by different states of Brazil. The lack of uniform, official lyrics would only be terminated in 1922, during the celebrations of the first centennial of the Proclamation of Independence, when an adapted version of Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada&#x27;s lyrics, first proposed in 1909, were deemed official.

The official lyrics of the Brazilian National Anthem were proclaimed by decree of president Epitácio Pessoa (Decree No. 15,761 of 1922), issued on 6 September 1922, at the height of the celebrations of the Independence Centennial. This presidential decree was issued in accordance with authorization contained in a legislative decree adopted by the National Congress of Brazil on 21 August 1922. Furthermore, as allowed by said legislative decree, and before the President of the Republic issued his decree proclaiming the official adoption of Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada&#x27;s lyrics as the official lyrics of the National anthem, the Federal Government finalized the purchase of the lyrics written by Duque Estrada, signing with the composer the contract that transferred all the rights of authorship over the said lyrics to the Federal Union, and paying the agreed price of Rs5:000$ (five &quot;contos&quot; of réis).

On 7 September 1922, on the exact day of the Independence Centennial, radio broadcasts began in Brazil, and the first broadcast was the performance of the National Anthem with the new lyrics, followed by the speech by president Epitácio Pessoa, the first radio address by a Brazilian president.

The national anthem is considered by the current Constitution of Brazil, adopted in 1988, to be one of the four national symbols of the country, along with the Flag, the Coat of Arms and the National Seal. The legal norms currently in force concerning the national anthem are contained in a statute passed in 1971 (Law No. 5,700 of 1 September 1971), regulating the national symbols. This law regulates in great detail the form of the national anthem and how and when it is to be played.

The music of the national anthem was originally intended to be played by symphonic orchestras; for the playing of the anthem by bands, the march composed by Antão Fernandes is included in the instrumentation. This adaptation, long in use, was made official by the 1971 statute regulating national symbols. This same statute also confirmed as official the traditional vocal adaptation of the lyrics of the national anthem, in F major, composed by Alberto Nepomuceno.

Due to the fact that the traditional vocal adaptation composed by Alberto Nepomuceno for Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada&#x27;s lyrics of the national anthem was made official in 1971, other vocal arrangements (as well as other instrumental arrangements departing from the one recognized in law) are unofficial. Because of that, for the remainder of the Military Dictatorship era (that lasted until 1985), the playing of the anthem with any artistic arrangement that departed from the official orchestration and vocal adaptation was prohibited, and there was strict vigilance regarding the use of the National Symbols and the enforcement of this norm. Since the redemocratization of the country, far greater artistic liberty has been allowed regarding renderings of the national anthem. Singer Fafá de Belém&#x27;s interpretation of the national anthem (initially criticized during the final days of the Military Dictatorship, but now widely accepted), is an example of that. In any event, although the use of different artistic arrangements for the anthem is now allowed (and although the statutory norms that prohibited such arrangements are no longer enforced, on the grounds of constitutional freedom of expression), a rendering of the national anthem is only considered fully official when the statutory norms regarding the vocal adaptation and orchestration are followed. However, the traditional vocal adaptation composed by Alberto Nepomuceno was so well established by the time it became official that the interpretations of the national anthem that depart from the official orchestration or from the official vocal adaptation are few. Indeed, although other arrangements are now allowed, the traditional form tends to prevail, so that, with few exceptions, even celebrity singers tend to only lend their voices to the singing of the official vocal adaptation by Alberto Nepomuceno.

The anthem is sung in Brazil&#x27;s official national language, the Portuguese language.

==Lyrics==
The song consists of two consecutive stanzas. The adoption in 1922 of lyrics containing two stanzas thus created the present situation of the music of the anthem being played twice so as to allow for the singing of both stanzas.

The Brazilian law stipulates that the B-flat major music needs to be played only once in instrumental renditions of the anthem without vocal accompaniment (thus, in instrumental renditions without vocal accompaniment, the playing of the music twice is optional), but both stanzas must be sung in vocal performances (F major).

Certain renditions of the anthem exist for sporting events which vary in length and composition. For example, FIFA matches only have the first three paragraphs of the first stanza followed by the ending instrumental. The Olympic Games uses a version where the first and last sections of the first verse are used, followed by the chorus and the ending. Otherwise an official rendition of the anthem consists of the introductory section, the first verse, chorus, and ending. The second stanza is usually omitted from most official occasions.

In the lyrics, the opening line&#x27;s mention of the Ipiranga river refers to the stream near (and now part of) the city of São Paulo where Prince Dom Pedro, the future Emperor Dom Pedro I of Brazil, declared Brazilian independence from Portugal.

<doc id="251123" wikidata="Q19944476" url="?curid=251123" title="Urushiol">
<text>Urushiol is an oily mixture of organic compounds with allergenic properties found in plants of the family Anacardiaceae, especially &quot;Toxicodendron&quot; &quot;spp.&quot; (e.g., poison oak, Chinese lacquer tree, poison ivy, poison sumac), &quot;Comocladia spp.&quot; (maidenplums), &quot;Metopium spp&quot;. (poisonwood), and also in parts of the mango tree and the fruit of the cashew tree. 

In most individuals, urushiol causes an allergic skin rash on contact, known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis.

The name urushiol is derived from the Japanese word for the lacquer tree, . The oxidation and polymerization of urushiol in the tree&#x27;s sap in the presence of moisture allows it to form a hard lacquer, which is used to produce traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese lacquerware.

== History ==
Although urushiol-containing lacquers and their skin-irritating properties were well known in East Asia for several millennia beforehand, its first recorded Western texts were in 1624 by John Smith where he initially likened poison ivy to English ivy. He did not classify it as a poison at first due to the speed with which its rash disappeared and Smith hypothesized that there may actually be medicinal uses for the plant. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many experiments were done in this area to determine whether or not this theory was true. Because medicine was dominated by plant-based treatments at the time, physicians were hopeful that the strong effect this chemical produced on the body could be effective in some way. 

André-Ignace-Joseph Dufresnoy was one of the first to come up with a medicinal use for this chemical in 1780 when he boiled poison ivy to produce an infusion for internal use. This led to a distilled extract of poison ivy which he prescribed to many people suffering from skin problems and even paralysis. He claimed this treatment to have yielded several positive results.

For many years, poison ivy was thought to fall into the &quot;Rhus&quot; genus; however, in the 1900s, it was reclassified into a more appropriate genus, &quot;Toxicodendron&quot;, meaning &quot;poison tree&quot;. There were many documented cases of irritations and allergic reactions from the plant, and its prevalence in medicinal use quickly dwindled. After this new categorization, scientists began attempts to determine what it was that rendered plants of this genus noxious, starting with a hypothesis of a volatile oil present in the plants. 

While this proved incorrect, Rikou Majima from Japan was able to determine that the chemical urushiol was the irritant. Further, he determined that the substance was a type of alkyl catechol, and due to its structure it was able to penetrate the skin and survive on surfaces for months to years. Urushiol&#x27;s ability to polymerise into a hard glossy coating is the chemical basis for traditional lacquerware in many Asian countries. After urushiol comes in contact with oxygen, under certain conditions it becomes a black lacquer and has been named urushi lacquer.

== Characteristics ==
Urushiol in its pure form is a pale-yellow liquid with a density of about 0.968 g/mL and a boiling point of . It is soluble in diethyl ether, acetone, ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, and benzene.

Urushiol is a mixture of several closely related organic compounds. Each consists of a catechol substituted in the 3 position with a hydrocarbon chain that has 15 or 17 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon group may be saturated or unsaturated. The exact composition of the mixture varies, depending on the plant source. Whereas western poison oak urushiol contains chiefly catechols with C17 side-chains, poison ivy and poison sumac contain mostly catechols with C15 sidechains.

The likelihood and severity of allergic reaction to urushiol is dependent on the degree of unsaturation of the hydrocarbon chain. Less than half of the general population experience a reaction with the saturated urushiol alone, but over 90% do so with urushiol that contains at least two degrees of unsaturation (double bonds). Longer side chains tend to produce a stronger reaction.

Urushiol is an oleoresin contained within the sap of poison ivy and related plants, and after injury to the plant, or late in the fall, the sap leaks to the surface of the plant, where under certain temperature and humidity conditions the urushiol becomes a blackish lacquer after being in contact with oxygen. Urushi lacquer is very stable. It is able to withstand disturbances from alkali, acid, and alcohol, while also being able to resist temperatures of over 300 °C. However, the lacquer can be degraded by UV rays from the sun and other sources.

Within the United States, urushiol-containing plants are widely distributed. Poison ivy can be found in all states except California, Alaska, and Hawaii. Poison oak can be found on the west coast or in some states in the southeast, while poison sumac can be found only in the eastern half of the country.

These plants all have distinguishing features that will help in identification. Poison ivy always grows with groups of three glossy, pointed leaflets on leaves that alternate along the branch (in contrast to similar looking leaves of boxelder which has opposite leaves). Poison oak has a similar appearance, but with larger and more rounded lobes, with a light, velvety pubescence and grow in groups of 3, 5, or 7. Poison sumac grows in groups of 7 to 13 leaflets, always an odd number. The leaflets are ovate-lanceolate and glossy.

== Allergic response and treatment ==

Before the urushiol has been absorbed by the skin, it can be removed with a washcloth using soap and water. Substantial amounts of urushiol may be absorbed within minutes. Once urushiol has penetrated the skin, attempting to remove it with water is ineffective. After being absorbed by the skin, it is recognized by the immune system&#x27;s dendritic cells, otherwise called Langerhans cells. These cells then migrate to the lymph nodes, where they present the urushiol to T-lymphocytes and thus recruit them to the skin, and the T-lymphocytes cause pathology through the production of cytokines and cytotoxic damage to the skin. This causes the painful rash, blisters, and itching.

Once this response starts, only a few treatments, such as cortisone or prednisone, are effective. Medications that can reduce the irritation include antihistamines (diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or cetirizine (Zyrtec)). Other treatments include applying cold water or calamine lotion to soothe the pain and stop the itching.

Research conducted on urushiol by Mahmoud ElSohly led to the development of PDC-APB, a candidate for a vaccine against skin irritation from poison ivy.

== Mechanism of action ==

To cause an allergic dermatitis reaction, the urushiol is first oxidized to create two double-bonded oxygens on the chemical. It then reacts with a protein nucleophile to trigger a reaction within the skin. Dermatitis is mediated by an acquired immune response. Urushiol is too small to directly activate an immune response. Instead, it attaches to certain proteins of the skin, where it acts as a hapten, leading to a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

Hydrocortisone, the active ingredient in cortisone, works to alleviate this condition by stopping the release of chemicals that cause the dermatitis reaction. Hydrocortisone itself does not react with urushiol in any way.

<text>&quot;&quot; (Jawi: ; &quot;God Bless the Sultan&quot;) is the national anthem of Brunei Darussalam. The anthem is sung in Malay, the national language of the country. It was written by Pengiran Haji Muhammad Yusuf bin Pengiran Abdul Rahim, better known by his pen name Yura Halim, and composed by Haji Besar bin Sagap in 1947. The song was adopted in 1951 as the national anthem of the British protectorate of Brunei. It was adapted as the national anthem of Brunei Darussalam upon independence from the United Kingdom, and was sung as the national anthem of the independent state at the stroke of midnight 1 January 1984.

==Usage==
The national anthem is played each morning early breakfast on radio and television by Radio Televisyen Brunei (RTB) and at the station opening and station closedown of its transmission for the day.

<text>Ralph Robert Wheeler Lingen, 1st Baron Lingen (19 December 1819 – 22 July 1905) was an English civil servant.

==Background and education==
Lingen was born in Birmingham, where his father was in business. He was the grandson of Ralph Lingen, Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and was a descendant of Elisabeth de Burgh (d. 1522). Lingen was first educated at Bridgnorth Grammar School and then became a scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1837. He won the Ireland (1838) and Hertford (1839) scholarships; and after taking a first-class in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; (1840), was elected a fellow of Balliol (1841). He subsequently won the Chancellor&#x27;s Latin Essay (1843) and the Eldon Law Scholarship (1846).

==Career==
After teaching as an assistant master at Rugby School he entered the Inns of Court as a Barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He was called to the bar in 1847; but instead of practising as a barrister, he accepted an appointment in the Education Office. It was in this role that he became involved with the 1847 Blue Books episode in 1847-8 within which his disdain of the Welsh became apparent.

After a short period he was chosen in 1849 to succeed Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth as its secretary or chief permanent official. He retained this position till 1869. The Education Office of that day had to administer a somewhat chaotic system of government grants to local schools, and Lingen was conspicuous for his fearless discrimination and rigid economy, qualities which characterized his whole career. When Robert Lowe (Lord Sherbrooke) became, as vice-president of the council, his parliamentary chief, Lingen worked congenially with him in producing the Revised Code of 1862 which incorporated &quot;payment by results&quot;; but the education department encountered adverse criticism, and in 1864 the vote of censure in parliament which caused Lowe&#x27;s resignation, founded (but erroneously) on an alleged &quot;editing&quot; of the school inspectors&#x27; reports, was inspired by a certain antagonism to Lingen&#x27;s as well as to Lowe&#x27;s methods.

Shortly before the introduction of Forster&#x27;s Education Act of 1870, Lingen was transferred to the post of permanent secretary of the treasury. In this office, which he held till 1885, he proved a most efficient guardian of the public purse, and he was a tower of strength to successive chancellors of the exchequer. It used to be said that the best recommendation for a secretary of the treasury was to be able to say &quot;No&quot; so disagreeably that nobody would court a repetition. Lingen was at all events a most successful resister of importunate claims, and his undoubted talents as a financier were most prominently displayed in the direction of parsimony. In 1885 he retired. He had been made a CB in 1869 and a KCB in 1878, and on his retirement he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lingen, of Lingen in the County of Hereford. In 1889 he was made one of the first aldermen of the new London County Council, but he resigned in 1892 with increasing deafness. His portrait contains the heraldic arms of Trinity College and not his personal arms which are recorded in Burke&#x27;s Peerage and around his neck hangs his KCB order of knighthood.

==Personal life==
In 1852 Lord Lingen married Emma Hutton (1826-1908), daughter of Robert Hutton. There were no children from the marriage. He died on 22 July 1905, aged 85, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. The grave lies on the western side of the central enclosed roundel. The peerage died with him.

Lady Emma Lingen died in January 1908 and is buried with him.

<text>&quot;Ditanyè&quot; (usually written &quot;&#x27;&quot;), also known as &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;The Anthem of Victory&quot;, ;) or &quot;&quot; (&quot;One Single Night&quot;), is the national anthem of Burkina Faso. Former president Thomas Sankara, also a jazz guitarist, wrote the lyrics. The composer of the melody is unknown, but it has also been attributed to Sankara.

It was adopted during his presidency in a decree issued on 2 August 1984, effective midnight on 4 August 1984, the first anniversary of Sankara&#x27;s accession to the presidency. The decree also renamed the country from Upper Volta to its current name. The anthem replaced the &quot;Hymne National Voltaïque&quot;, the national anthem of Upper Volta.

<text>Sir James Phillips Kay-Shuttleworth, 1st Baronet (20 July 1804 – 26 May 1877, born James Kay) of Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire, was a British politician and educationist. He founded a further-education college that would eventually become Plymouth Marjon University.

==Early life==
He was born James Kay at Rochdale, Lancashire, the son of Robert Kay and the brother of Joseph Kay and Sir Edward Ebenezer Kay.

==Career==
At first engaged in a Rochdale bank, he became in 1824 a medical student at the University of Edinburgh. He settled in Manchester about 1827 and was instrumental in setting up the Manchester Statistical Society. He worked for the Ardwick and Ancoats Dispensary. While still known simply as Dr James Kay, he wrote &quot;The Moral and Physical Condition of the Working Class Employed in the Cotton Manufacture in Manchester&quot; (1832), which Friedrich Engels cited in &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;. The experience he gained of the conditions of the poor in Lancashire factory districts, along with his interest in economic science, led to an appointment in 1835 as poor law commissioner in Norfolk and Suffolk and later in the London districts. In 1839, he became first secretary of a committee formed by the Privy Council to administer the Government grant for public education in Britain.

In 1840, he founded with E. Carleton Tufnell the Battersea Normal College for the training of teachers of pauper children. This became St John&#x27;s College, Battersea, which later merged to form the College of St Mark and St John and moved to Plymouth. In 2012, it gained full university status as the University of St Mark &amp; St John. The original college was the first training college for schoolteachers; today&#x27;s system of national school education, with public inspection, trained teachers and the support of state as well as local funds, is largely due to its founders&#x27; initiative.

==Later life==

A breakdown in health led him to resign his post on the committee in 1849, but recovery allowed him an active part in the central relief committee instituted under Lord Derby during the Lancashire cotton famine of 1861–1865. He was created a baronet of Gawthorpe Hall in the County Palatine of Lancaster in 1849. Until the end of his life he interested himself in the movements of the Liberal Party in Lancashire and in the progress of education. His &quot;Physiology, Pathology and Treatment of Asphyxia&quot; became a standard textbook. He also wrote numerous papers on public education. He was a key figure in the foundation of the Girls&#x27; Public Day School Company and a member of its council until shortly before his death.

==Personal life==
In 1842, he married Janet Shuttleworth (born 9 November 1817, half-sister of Marianne North), assuming by royal licence his bride&#x27;s name and arms. His wife had inherited the estate centred on Gawthorpe Hall in Padiham at the age of four months.

They had five children. His eldest son, Sir Ughtred James Kay-Shuttleworth (1844–1939), became a well-known Liberal politician, as MP for Hastings from 1869 to 1880 and for the Clitheroe division of Lancashire from 1885 to 1902, when he was created Baron Shuttleworth. He was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1886, and secretary to the Admiralty between 1892 and 1895.

Charlotte Brontë visited the Kay-Shuttleworths twice at Gawthorpe Hall in 1850 and again in 1855. She was also introduced to Elizabeth Gaskell by the Kay-Shuttleworth&#x27;s, when both women were invited to stay at their rented home in the Lake District in 1850.

James Kay-Shuttleworth died in 1877 in London and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

<text>Henri-Alexandre Wallon (23 December 1812 – 13 November 1904) was a French historian and whose decisive contribution to the creation of the Third Republic led him to be called the &quot;Father of the Republic&quot;. He was the grandfather of psychologist and politician Henri Wallon.

==Early life==
Wallon was born at Valenciennes, Nord on 23 December 1812.

==Career==

Devoting himself to a literary career, in 1840 he became professor at the École Normale Supérieure under the patronage of Guizot, whom he succeeded as professor at the Faculté des Lettres in 1846. His works on slavery in the French colonies (1847) and on slavery in antiquity (1848; new edition in 3 vols., 1879) led to his being placed, after the Revolution of 1848, on a commission for the regulation of labour in the French colonial possessions, and in November 1849 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly by the department of the Nord. He resigned in 1850, disapproving of the measure for the restriction of the suffrage adopted by the majority. In the same year he was elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions, of which he became perpetual secretary in 1873.

Under the empire he withdrew altogether from political life, and occupied himself entirely with his duties as a professor of history and with historical writings, the most original of which is a biography, &quot;Richard II, épisode de la rivalité de la France et de l&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (2 vols., 1864). Although remaining a republican, he exhibited decided clerical leanings in his &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; (2 vols., 1860; 2nd ed., 1875); &quot;La Vie de Notre Seigneur Jésus&quot; (1865) – a reply to the &quot;Vie de Jésus&quot; of E. Renan; and &quot;Saint Louis et son temps&quot; (1871; 4th ed., 1892), which still ranks among hagiographical works.

Returning to politics after the Franco-Prussian War, Wallon was re-elected by the department of the Nord in 1871, took an active part in the proceedings of the Assembly, and finally immortalized himself by carrying his proposition for the establishment of the Republic with a president elected for seven years, and then eligible for re-election, which, after violent debates, was adopted by the Assembly on 30 January 1875. &quot;Ma proposition,&quot; he declared, &quot;ne proclame pas la République, elle la fait.&quot; Upon the definitive establishment of the Republic, Wallon became Minister of Public Instruction, and effected many useful reforms, but his views were too conservative for the majority of the Assembly, and he retired in May 1876. He had been chosen a life senator in December 1875.

Returning to his historical studies, Wallon produced four works of great importance, though less from his part in them as author than from the documents which accompanied them:
*&quot;La Terreur&quot; (1873)
*&quot;Histoire du tribunal révolutionnaire de Paris avec le journal de ses actes&quot; (6 vols., 1880–1882)
*&quot;La Révolution du 31 mai et le fédéralisme en 1793&quot; (2 vols., 1886)
*&quot;Les Représentants du peuple en mission et la justice révolutionnaire dans les départements&quot; (5 vols., 1880–1890).

Besides these he published a number of articles in the &quot;Journal des savants&quot;; for many years he wrote the history of the Académie des Inscriptions in the collection of Memoirs of this academy, and he composed obituary notices of his colleagues, which were inserted in the Bulletin.

==Death==
On his death on 13 November 1904, Henri Wallon was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

<text>James Darmesteter (28 March 184919 October 1894) was a French author, orientalist, and antiquarian.

==Biography==
He was born of Jewish parents at Château-Salins, in Lorraine. The family name had originated in their earlier home of Darmstadt. He was educated in Paris, where, under the guidance of Michel Bréal and Abel Bergaigne, he imbibed a love for Oriental studies, to which for a time he entirely devoted himself. In 1875, he published a thesis on the mythology of the &quot;Avesta&quot;, in which he advocated that the Persian religion of Zoroastrianism had been influenced by Judaism (and not that Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism as many scholars said). In 1877 became teacher of Persian language at the École des Hautes Études. He continued his research with his &quot;Études iraniennes&quot; (1883), and ten years later published a complete translation of the &quot;Avesta&quot; and associated &quot;Zend&quot; (lit. &quot;commentary&quot;), with historical and philological commentary of his own (&quot;Zend Avesta&quot;, 3 vols., 1892–1893) in the &quot;Annales du Musée Guimet&quot;. He also edited the &quot;Avesta&quot; for Max Müller&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Books of the East&quot; series (vols. 4 and 23).

Darmesteter regarded the extant texts as far more recent than commonly believed, placing the earliest in the 1st century BC and the bulk in the 3rd century AD. In 1885 he was appointed professor in the Collège de France, and was sent to India in 1886 on a mission to collect the popular songs of the Afghans, a translation of which, with a valuable essay on the Afghan language and literature, he published on his return. His impressions of British rule in India were conveyed in &quot;Lettres sur l&#x27;Inde&quot; (1888). England interested him deeply; and his attachment to the gifted English writer, Agnes Mary Frances Robinson, whom he shortly afterwards married (and who in 1901 became the wife of Professor E. Duclaux, director of the Pasteur Institute at Paris), led him to translate her poems into French in 1888. Two years after his death a collection of excellent essays on English subjects was published in English. He also wrote &quot;Le Mahdi depuis les origines de l&#x27;Islam jusqu&#x27;a nos jours&quot; (1885); &quot;Les Origines de la poesie persane&quot; (1888); &quot;Prophètes d&#x27;Israel&quot; (1892), and other books on topics connected with the East, and from 1883 onwards drew up the annual reports of the Société Asiatique. He had just become connected with the &quot;Revue de Paris&quot;, when his delicate constitution succumbed to a slight attack of illness on 10 October 1894 at Maisons-Laffitte.

His elder brother, Arsène Darmesteter, was a distinguished philologist and man of letters.

There is a survey of James Darmesteter&#x27;s work in the &quot;Journal asiatique&quot; (1894, vol. iv., pp. 519–534), and an obituary by Henri Cordier, with a list of his writings, in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot; (January 1895); see also Gaston Paris, &quot;James Darmesteter,&quot; in &quot;Penseurs et poètes&quot; (1896), (pp. 1–61).

<text>Arsène Darmesteter (5 January 184616 November 1888) was a distinguished French philologist and man of letters.

==Biography==
He studied under Gaston Paris at the École pratique des hautes études, and became professor of Old French language and literature at the Sorbonne, where he met his wife, the painter Héléna Hartog. His &quot;Life of Words&quot; appeared in English in 1888. He also collaborated with Adolphe Hatzfeld in a &quot;Dictionnaire général de la langue française&quot; (2 vols., 1895–1900). Among his most important work was the elucidation of Old French by means of the many glosses in the medieval writings of Rashi and other French Jews.

His scattered papers on Romance and Jewish philology were collected by James Darmesteter as &quot;Arsène Darmesteter, reliques scientifiques&quot; (2 vols., 1890). His valuable &quot;Cours de grammaire historique de la langue française&quot; was edited after his death by E. Muret and L. Sudre (1891–1895; English edition, 1902).

<doc id="251144" wikidata="Q327306" url="?curid=251144" title="Michel Bréal">
<text>Michel Jules Alfred Bréal (; 26 March 183225 November 1915), French philologist, was born at Landau in Rhenish Palatinate. He is often identified as a founder of modern semantics. He was also the creator of the modern marathon race, having proposed its first running at the 1896 Olympic Games and offered what would become known as Breal&#x27;s Silver Cup to the winner.

==Life and career==
Michel Bréal was born at Landau in Germany of French-Jewish parents.

After studying at Wissembourg, Metz and Paris, he entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1852. In 1857 he went to Berlin, where he studied Sanskrit under Franz Bopp and Albrecht Weber. On his return to France he obtained an appointment in the department of oriental manuscripts at the Bibliothèque Impériale. In 1864 he became professor of comparative grammar at the Collège de France, in 1875 member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres, in 1879 &quot;inspecteur général&quot; for higher education until the abolition of the office in 1888. In 1890 he was made commander of the Legion of Honour. He resigned his chair in 1905, and died in Paris.

In 1883, Bréal coined the term semantics in the article “Les lois intellectuelles du langage. Fragment de sémantique” published in the journal &quot;Annuaire de l&#x27;association des études grecques en France&quot; (page 133).

==Invention of the modern marathon==
Bréal is credited with the invention of the marathon race. He attended the 1894 Founding Congress of the International Olympic Committee at the Sorbonne in Paris; at its concluding dinner, he was seated next to the father of the modern games, Pierre de Coubertin. Soon after the congress, on September 15, 1894, Bréal sent Coubertin a letter outlining his idea:

The legend of the ancient run — the run of the Greek soldier Pheidippides to announce victory at the Battle of Marathon to either Athens — had become more culturally prominent in late 19th-century Europe. Robert Browning&#x27;s 1879 poem &quot;Pheidippides&quot; had brought the story to wider attention, as had an 1890 archeological dig of the Marathon tumuli. Before Bréal&#x27;s proposal, the 1896 Olympics had not planned any races longer than 1500 meters; some argued that such a long distance was &quot;contrary to the principles of sport and of hygiene.&quot;

As part of his sponsorship of the race, Bréal had a Paris jeweler create Breal&#x27;s Silver Cup for the winner, who ended up being the Greek Spyros Louis.

==Works==
Among his works, which deal mainly with mythological and philological subjects, may be mentioned:
*&quot;L&#x27;Étude des origines de la religion zoroastrienne&quot; (1862), for which a prize was awarded him by the Académie des Inscriptions
*&quot;Hercule et Cacus&quot; (1863), in which he disputes the principles of the symbolic school in the interpretation of myths
*&quot;Le Mythe d&#x27;Œdipe&quot; (1864)
*&quot;Les Tables eugubines&quot; (1875)
*&quot;Mélanges de mythologie et de linguistique&quot; (2nd. ed., 1882)
*&quot;Leçons de mots&quot; (1882, 1886)
*&quot;Dictionnaire étymologique latin&quot; (1885)
*&quot;Grammaire latine&quot; (1890).
*&quot;Essai de sémantique&quot; (1897), on the signification of words, which was translated into English by Mrs Emmeline Cust with preface by J. P. Postgate.
*a translation of Bopp&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot; (1866–1874), with introductions, which is highly valued.
He also wrote pamphlets on education in France, the teaching of ancient languages, and the reform of French orthography. In 1906 he published &quot;Pour mieux connaitre Homère&quot;.

<text>Isatis tinctoria, also called woad (), dyer&#x27;s woad, dyer&#x27;s-weed, or glastum, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae (the mustard family) with a documented history of use as a blue dye and medicinal plant. 

Its genus name, &quot;Isatis&quot;, derives from the ancient Greek word for the plant, . It is occasionally known as Asp of Jerusalem. Woad is also the name of a blue dye produced from the leaves of the plant. Woad is native to the steppe and desert zones of the Caucasus, Central Asia to Eastern Siberia and Western Asia but is now also found in South-Eastern and Central Europe and western North America.

Since ancient times, woad was an important source of blue dye and was cultivated throughout Europe, especially in Western and Southern Europe. In medieval times, there were important woad-growing regions in England, Germany and France. Towns such as Toulouse became prosperous from the woad trade. 

Woad was eventually replaced by the more colourfast &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; and, in the early 20th century, both woad and &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; were replaced by synthetic blue dyes. Woad has been used medicinally for centuries. The double use of woad is seen in its name: the term &quot;Isatis&quot; is linked to its ancient use to treat wounds; the term &quot;tinctoria&quot; references its use as a dye. There has also been some revival of the use of woad for craft purposes.

==History of woad cultivation==
===Ancient use===

The first archaeological finds of woad seeds date to the Neolithic period. The seeds have been found in the cave of l&#x27;Audoste, Bouches-du-Rhône, France. Impressions of seeds of &quot;Färberwaid&quot; (Isatis tinctoria L.) or German indigo, of the plant family &quot;Brassicaceae&quot;, have been found on pottery in the Iron Age settlement of Heuneburg, Germany. Seed and pod fragments have also been found in an Iron Age pit at Dragonby, North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The Hallstatt burials of the Hochdorf Chieftain&#x27;s Grave and Hohmichele contained textiles dyed with woad.

Melo and Rondão write that woad was known &quot;as far back as the time of the ancient Egyptians, who used it to dye the cloth wrappings applied for the mummies.&quot; Skelton states that one of the early dyes discovered by the ancient Egyptians was &quot;blue woad (Isatis tinctoria).&quot; Lucas writes, &quot;What has been assumed to have been Indian Indigo on ancient Egyptian fabrics may have been woad.&quot; Hall states that the ancient Egyptians created their blue dye &quot;by using indigotin, otherwise known as woad.&quot;

A dye known as in Aramaic, is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.

Celtic blue is a shade of blue, also known as in Welsh, or in both the Irish language and in Scottish Gaelic. Julius Caesar reported (in ) that the Britanni used to colour their bodies blue with , a word that means primarily , but also the domestic name for the woad (&quot;Isatis tinctoria&quot;), besides the Gaulish loanword (from Proto-Celtic ). The connection seems to be that both glass and the woad are &quot;water-like&quot; ( is from Proto-Indo-European &quot;&quot;, ). In terms of usage, the Latin is more often used to refer to glass rather than woad. The use of the word for the woad might also be understood as &quot;coloured like glass&quot;, applied to the plant and the dye made from it.

Gillian Carr conducted experiments using indigo pigment derived from woad mixed with different binders to make body paint. The resulting paints yielded colours from &quot;grey-blue, through intense midnight blue, to black&quot;. People with modern experiences with woad as a tattoo pigment have claimed that it does not work well, and is actually caustic and causes scarring when put into the skin.

It has also been claimed that Caesar was referring to some form of copper- or iron-based pigment. Analysis done on the Lindow Man did return evidence of copper. The same study also noted that the earliest definite reference to the woad plant in the British Isles dates to a seed impression on an Anglo-Saxon pot. The authors theorize that vitrum could have actually referred to copper(II) sulfate&#x27;s naturally occurring variant chalcanthite or to the mineral azurite. A later study concluded the amount was &quot;not of sufficient magnitude to provide convincing evidence that the copper was deliberately applied as paint&quot;.

Woad was an important dyeing agent in much of Europe and parts of England during the medieval period. However, dye traders began to import indigo during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which threatened to replace locally grown woad as the primary blue dye. The translation of vitrum as woad may date to this period.

===Medieval period onwards===
Woad was one of the three staples of the European dyeing industry, along with weld (yellow) and madder (red). Chaucer mentions their use by the dyer (&quot;litestere&quot;) in his poem &quot;The Former Age&quot;:


:::No mader, welde, or wood no litestere
:::Ne knew; the flees was of his former hewe;

The three colours can be seen together in tapestries such as &quot;The Hunt of the Unicorn&quot; (1495–1505), though typically it is the dark blue of the woad that has lasted best. Medieval uses of the dye were not limited to textiles. For example, the illustrator of the &quot;Lindisfarne Gospels&quot; () used a woad-based pigment for blue paint. As does the late 13th century North Italian manual on book illumination &quot;Liber colorum secundum magistrum Bernardum&quot; describe its usage.

In Viking Age levels at archaeological digs at York, a dye shop with remains of both woad and madder have been excavated and dated to the 10th century. In medieval times, centres of woad cultivation lay in Lincolnshire and Somerset in England, Jülich and the Erfurt area in Thuringia in Germany, Piedmont and Tuscany in Italy, and Gascogne, Normandy, the Somme Basin (from Amiens to Saint-Quentin), Brittany and, above all, Languedoc in France. This last region, in the triangle created by Toulouse, Albi and Carcassonne, known as the Lauragais, was for a long time the biggest producer of woad, or &quot;pastel&quot;, as it was locally known. One writer commented that &quot;woad […] hath made that country the happiest and richest in Europe.&quot;


The prosperous woad merchants of Toulouse displayed their affluence in splendid mansions, many of which still stand, as the Hôtel de Bernuy and the Hôtel d&#x27;Assézat. One merchant, Jean de Bernuy, a Spanish Jew who had fled the Spanish Inquisition, was credit-worthy enough to be the main guarantor of the ransomed King Francis I after his capture at the Battle of Pavia by Charles V of Spain. Much of the woad produced here was used for the cloth industry in southern France, but it was also exported via Bayonne, Narbonne and Bordeaux to Flanders, the Low Countries, Italy, and above all Britain and Spain.

After cropping the woad eddish could be let out for grazing sheep.
The woad produced in Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire in the 19th century was shipped out from the Port of Wisbech, Spalding and Boston, both the last to northern mills and the USA. The last portable woad mill was at Parson Drove, Cambridgeshire, Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum has a woad mill model, photos and other items used in woad production.
A major market for woad was at Görlitz in Lausitz. The citizens of the five Thuringian &quot;Färberwaid&quot; (dye woad) towns of Erfurt, Gotha, Tennstedt, Arnstadt and Langensalza had their own charters. In Erfurt, the woad-traders gave the funds to found the University of Erfurt. Traditional fabric is still printed with woad in Thuringia, Saxony and Lusatia today: it is known as &quot;Blaudruck&quot; (literally, &quot;blue print(ing)&quot;).

In the Marche region, the cultivation of the plant was an important resource for the Duchy of Urbino in Italy. To fully understand the importance of the ford industry in the State of Urbino, it is enough to read the comprehensive Chapters of the art of wool in 1555, which dictated prescriptions regarding the cultivation and trade of woad, whether in loaves or macerated (powdered). Testifying to the importance that this crop had in the economy in addition to the archival documents was the identification of a hundred millstones surveyed by Delio Bischi in the province of Pesaro and Urbino, the original use of which had become completely unknown as their memory had been lost.

===Use as Chinese medicine===

The woad plant&#x27;s roots are used in Traditional Chinese medicine to make a medicine known as &quot;banlangen&quot; ( ) that purports to have antiviral properties. &quot;Banlangen&quot; is used as an herbal medicinal tea in China for colds and tonsillar ailments. Used as a tea, it has a brownish appearance and (unlike most Chinese medicines) is mildly sweet in taste.

==Woad and indigo==

The dye chemical extracted from woad is indigo, the same dye extracted from &quot;true indigo&quot;, &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot;, but in a lower concentration. Following the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India by the navigator Vasco da Gama in 1498, great amounts of indigo were imported from Asia. Laws were passed in some parts of Europe to protect the woad industry from the competition of the indigo trade. It was proclaimed that indigo caused yarns to rot. This prohibition was repeated in 1594 and again in 1603. In France, Henry IV, in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of &quot;the false and pernicious Indian drug&quot;.

With the development of a chemical process to synthesize the pigment, both the woad and natural indigo industries collapsed in the first years of the 20th century. The last commercial harvest of woad until recent times occurred in 1932, in Lincolnshire, Britain. Small amounts of woad are now grown in the UK and France to supply craft dyers. The classic book about woad is &quot;The Woad Plant and its Dye&quot; by J. B. Hurry, Oxford University Press of 1930, which contains an extensive bibliography.

A method for producing blue dye from woad is described in &quot;The History of Woad and the Medieval Woad Vat&quot; (1998) .

Woad is biodegradable and safe in the environment. In Germany, there have been attempts to use it to protect wood against decay without applying dangerous chemicals. Production of woad is increasing in the UK for use in inks, particularly for inkjet printers, and dyes.

==Invasive and noxious weed==
In certain locations, the plant is classified as a non-native and invasive weed. It is listed as a noxious weed by the agriculture departments of several states in the western United States: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. In Montana, it has been the target of an extensive, and largely successful, eradication attempt.

<doc id="251154" wikidata="Q631618" url="?curid=251154" title="Nokor Reach">
<text>&quot;Nokor Reach&quot; (; – ) is the national anthem of Cambodia. It is based on a Cambodian folk tune and was written by Chuon Nath.

==History==
&quot;Nokor Reach&quot; originated from a folk poetry usually performed with chapei in ancient era for storytelling and to disclose any recent events.

The music of &quot;Nokor Reach&quot; was composed between 1938 and 1939 by Prince Norodom Suramarit during the reign of King Sisowath Monivong with help of J. Jekyll and François Perruchot, the Royal Palace&#x27;s musical instructors. The lyrics were not finished until 20 July 1941 by Choun Nath, a few months after King Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s coronation. In the same year, it was adopted then reconfirmed in 1947 as a national anthem for the country.

In 1970, the monarchy was abolished by the Khmer Republic, thereby replacing the state&#x27;s national anthem as well. After the communists&#x27; victory in 1975, former royalist symbols, including &quot;Nokor Reach&quot;, were reinstated for a short while. The Khmer Rouge then replaced it with &quot;Dap Prampi Mesa Chokchey&quot; (&quot;Glorious Seventeenth of April&quot;) in January 1976. After the royalist party FUNCINPEC defeated the former communists (Cambodian People&#x27;s Party) in the 1993 elections, the royalist state anthem was restored.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Nokor Reach&quot; is a poem consisting of three verses and each verse consists of five lines. The first verse is considered to be official and is usually performed at most official settings.


Until the end of the French protectorate, a fourth verse praising the friendship between the Khmer and the French people was sung:

<doc id="251155" wikidata="Q12755" url="?curid=251155" title="Canton of Jura">
<text>The Republic and Canton of Jura (officially in ), less formally the Canton of Jura or Canton Jura ( ; ), is the newest (founded in 1979) of the 26 Swiss cantons, located in the northwestern part of Switzerland. The capital is Delémont. It shares borders with the canton of Basel-Landschaft, the canton of Bern, the canton of Neuchatel, the canton of Solothurn, and the French regions of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté and Grand Est.

==History==
The king of Burgundy donated much of the land that today makes up canton Jura to the bishop of Basel in 999. The area was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire for more than 800 years. After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, the Jura had close ties with the Swiss Confederation. 
At the Congress of Vienna (1815), the Jura region became part of the canton of Bern. This act caused dissension. The Jura was French-speaking and Roman Catholic, whereas the canton of Bern was mostly German-speaking and Protestant.

After World War II, a separatist movement campaigned for a secession of Jura from the canton of Bern. After a long and partly militant struggle, which included some arson attacks by a youth organisation &quot;Les Béliers&quot;, a constitution was accepted in 1977. In 1978, the split was made official when the Swiss people voted in favour, and in 1979, the Jura joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member. The canton celebrated its independence from the canton of Bern on 23 June 1979. However, the southern part of the region, which is also predominantly French-speaking but has a Protestant majority, opted not to join the newly formed canton, instead remaining part of the canton of Bern. The area is now known as Bernese Jura. The word Jura, therefore, may refer either to canton Jura, or to the combined territory of canton Jura and the Bernese Jura. Switzerland as a whole often presents the latter from a touristic standpoint with documentation easily available in French or German.
On creation, the canton adopted the title Republic and Canton of Jura. Other cantons in Switzerland using the title &quot;Republic and Canton&quot; are Ticino, Geneva, and Neuchâtel. In each case, the title refers to the autonomy of the canton and its nominal sovereignty within the Swiss Confederation.

Since 1994, the question of the Jura region has again been controversial. In 2004, a federal commission proposed that the French-speaking southern Jura be united with the canton of Jura, as the language question now seems to be more important than the denominational one. A possible solution would be to create two half-cantons, as reunification with the creation of only a single canton would mean a complete restructuring of the Jura&#x27;s current political system, with the cantonal capital being transferred from Delémont to Moutier.

On 18 June 2017, the town of Moutier voted to secede from the canton of Bern and join the canton of Jura in a referendum. On 17 September 2017, the nearby municipalities of Belprahon and Sorvilier conversely voted to remain in the canton of Bern. The vote in Moutier was later declared invalid. On 28 March 2021, Moutier voted to secede from Bern and join Jura again in an officially sanctioned referendum. The changeover is expected to be implemented by 2026.

==Geography==
Canton Jura lies in the northwest of Switzerland. It consists of parts of the Jura mountains in the south and the Jura plateau in the north. The Jura plateau is hilly and almost entirely limestone. The districts of Ajoie and Franches-Montagnes lie in this region. The term &quot;Jurassic&quot; is derived from the Jura Alps, strata of which give the era its name.

To the north and the west of the canton lies France. The canton of Solothurn and Basel-Landschaft are to east of the canton, while the canton of Bern bounds the Jura to the south. The rivers Doubs and the Birs drain the lands. The Doubs joins the Saône and then the Rhône, whereas the Birs is a tributary to the Rhine.

<text>Bruno Paulin Gaston Paris (; 9 August 1839 – 5 March 1903) was a French literary historian, philologist, and scholar specialized in Romance studies and medieval French literature. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901, 1902, and 1903.

==Biography==
Gaston Paris was born under the July Monarchy at Avenay (Marne), the son of Paulin Paris (1800–1881), an important French scholar of medieval French literature. In his childhood, Gaston learned to appreciate Old French romances as poems and stories, and this early impulse for the study of Romance literature was placed on a solid basis by courses of study at the University of Bonn (1856), in the German Confederation, and at the École Nationale des Chartes, at the time under the rule of the Second French Empire.

Paris taught French grammar in a private school, later succeeding his father as professor of medieval French literature at the Collège de France in 1872; in 1876 he was admitted to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, and in 1896 to the Académie Française; in 1895 he was appointed director of the Collège de France. He won a reputation as a renowned scholar of Romance literature throughout Europe. In Bonn he had learnt the scientific methods of exact research, but besides being an accurate philologist he was a literary critic of great acumen and breadth of view, and brought a singularly clear mind to bear on his favourite study of medieval French literature. His &quot;Vie de saint Alexis&quot; (1872) broke new ground and provided a model for future editors of medieval texts. It included the original text and the variations of it dating from the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. He contributed largely to the &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot;, and with Paul Meyer published &quot;Romania&quot;, an academic journal devoted to the study of Romance literature.

In 1877 Gaston Paris was invited to Sweden for the 400th anniversary of the Upsala University, where he was made an honorary doctor. Before returning home he also visited Kristiania (Oslo) to take part in a celebration of the Norwegian philosopher Marcus Jacob Monrad. At the University of Oslo Gaston Paris also held a lecture about the two folktale collectors, Asbjørnsen and Moe, which he believed to be, besides the Brothers Grimm, the best re-tellers of the genre.

He received the German Order Pour le Mérite (civil class) in August 1902. Paris died in Cannes in 1903.

Paris endeared himself to a wide circle of scholars outside his own country by his unfailing urbanity and generosity. In France, he trained a band of disciples at the École des Chartes and the Collège de France who continued the traditions of exact research that he established. Among them were Leopold Pannier; Marius Sepet, the author of &quot;Le Drame chrétien au Moyen Âge&quot; (1878) and &quot;Origines catholiques du théâtre moderne&quot; (1901); Charles Joret; Alfred Morel-Fatio; Gaston Raynaud, who was responsible for various volumes of the excellent editions published by the Société des anciens textes français; Arsène Darmesteter; and others.

<text>Friedrich Christian Diez (; 15 March 179429 May 1876) was a German philologist. The two works on which his fame rests are the &quot;Grammar of the Romance Languages&quot; (published 1836–1844), and the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Romance Languages&quot; (1853, and later editions). He spent most of his career at University of Bonn.

== Biography ==
Diez was born at Giessen, in Hessen-Darmstadt. He was educated first at the gymnasium and then at the university of his native town and Göttingen. There he studied classics under Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker who had just returned from a two years&#x27; residence in Italy to fill the chair of archaeology and Greek literature. It was Welcker who kindled in him a love of Italian poetry, and thus gave the first outlet to his genius. In 1813 he joined the Hesse corps as a volunteer and served in the French campaign. Next year he returned to his books, and this short taste of military service was the only break in a long and uneventful life of literary labours.

At his parents&#x27; desire he applied himself for a short time to law, but a visit to Goethe in 1818 gave a new direction to his studies, and determined his future career. Goethe had been reading Raynouard&#x27;s &quot;Selections from the Romance Poets&quot;, and advised the young scholar to explore the rich mine of Provençal literature which the French savant had opened up. This advice was eagerly followed, and henceforth Diez devoted himself to Romance literature. He thus became the founder of Romance philology.

After supporting himself for some years by private teaching, he moved in 1822 to University of Bonn, where he held the position of privatdozent. In 1823 he published his first work, &quot;An Introduction to Romance Poetry&quot;; in the following year appeared &quot;The Poetry of the Troubadours&quot;, and in 1829 &quot;The Lives and Works of the Troubadours&quot;. In 1830 he was called to the chair of modern literature.

The rest of his life was mainly occupied with the composition of the two great works on which his fame rests, the &quot;Grammar of the Romance Languages&quot; (1836–1844), and the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Romance Languages&quot; (1853, and later editions). In these two works Diez did for the Romance group of languages what Jacob Grimm did for the Germanic family.

The earliest French philologists, such as Perion and Henri Estienne, had sought to discover the origin of French in Greek and even in Hebrew. For more than a century Gilles Ménage&#x27;s &quot;Etymological Dictionary&quot; (1650, 1670) held the field without a rival. Considering the time at which it was written, Ménage&#x27;s was a meritorious work, but philology was then in the infant stage, and many of Ménage&#x27;s derivations (such as that of &quot;rat&quot; from the Latin &quot;mus,&quot; or of &quot;haricot&quot; from &quot;faba&quot;) have since become bywords among philologists. A great advance was made by Raynouard, who by his critical editions of the works of the &quot;Troubadours&quot;, published in the first years of the 19th century, laid the foundations on which Diez afterwards built.

The difference between Diez&#x27;s method and that of his predecessors is well stated by him in the preface to his dictionary. In sum, it is the difference between science and guess-work. The scientific method is to follow implicitly the discovered principles and rules of phonology, and not to swerve a foot&#x27;s breadth from them unless plain, actual exceptions shall justify it; to follow the genius of the language, and by cross-questioning to elicit its secrets; to gauge each letter and estimate the value which attaches to it in each position; and lastly to possess the true philosophic spirit which is prepared to welcome any new fact, though it may modify or upset the most cherished theory.

== Works ==
Such is the historical method which Diez pursues in his grammar and dictionary. To collect and arrange facts is, as he tells us, the sole secret of his success, and he adds in other words the apophthegm of Newton, &quot;hypotheses non fingo&quot;. The introduction to the grammar consists of two parts: the first discusses the Latin, Greek and Teutonic elements common to the Romance languages; the second treats of the six dialects separately, their origin and the elements peculiar to each. The grammar itself is divided into four books, on phonology, on flexion, on the formation of words by composition and derivation, and on syntax.

His dictionary is divided into two parts. The first contains words common to two at least of the three principal groups of Romance—Italian and Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese, and Provençal and French. The Italian, as nearest the original, is placed at the head of each article. The second part treats of words peculiar to one group. There is no separate glossary of Wallachian.

<text>Gilles Ménage (; 15 August 1613 – 23 July 1692) was a French scholar.

==Biography==
He was born at Angers, the son of Guillaume Ménage, king&#x27;s advocate at Angers. A good memory and enthusiasm for learning carried him quickly through his literary and professional studies, and he practised at the bar at Angers before he was twenty. In 1632, he pleaded several causes before the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris.

Illness caused him to abandon the legal profession for the church. He became prior of Montdidier without taking holy orders, and lived for some years in the household of Cardinal de Retz (then coadjutor to the Archbishop of Paris), where he had leisure for literary pursuits.

Some time after 1648, he quarrelled with his patron and withdrew to a house in the cloister of Notre-Dame de Paris, where he gathered round him on Wednesday evenings those literary assemblies which he called &quot;Mercuriales.&quot; Jean Chapelain, Paul Pellisson, Valentin Conrart, Jean François Sarrazin and Du Bos were among the &quot;habitués&quot;. He was tutor to Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette, later the great writer, to whom he was very attached. He was admitted to the Accademia della Crusca of Florence, but his caustic sarcasm led to his exclusion from the Académie française. Ménage made many enemies and suffered under the satire of Boileau and of Molière. Molière immortalized him as the pedant Vadius in &quot;Les Femmes savantes&quot;, a portrait Ménage pretended to ignore.

In 1664 he published at London an edition of the &quot;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&quot; by Diogenes Laërtius that contains an unedited anonymous life of Aristotle; this life was known as &#x27;Vita Menagiana&#x27; before the critical edition by Ingemar Düring, (&quot;Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition&quot; Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell 1957; reprinted New York, Garland, 1987, pp. 80–93) with the title &#x27;Vita Hesychii&#x27; (the attribution to Hesychius of Miletus is controversial). In 1690, he also published a supplement to the work of Diogenes Laërtius titled &quot;Historia Mulierum Philosopharum&quot;. It is more than a scholarly compilation of 65 women philosophers he had found from his studies of the books of ancient writers. He intended to create a history for these women and dedicated his work to Anne Lefevre Dacier (1654 – 17 August 1720), whom he described in his introduction as &quot;the most learned of women whether of the present or the past.&quot;

Ménage died in Paris in 1692. After his death his friends published, under the title of &quot;Menagiana&quot;, a collection of his witticisms and table talk. The edition of this collection by Bernard de la Monnoye (2 vols., 1693/4) has found favor.

<doc id="251176" wikidata="Q28106778" url="?curid=251176" title="Blue-winged teal">
<text>The blue-winged teal (Spatula discors) is a species of bird in the duck, goose, and swan family Anatidae. One of the smaller members of the dabbling duck group, it occurs in North America, where it breeds from southern Alaska to Nova Scotia, and south to northern Texas. It winters along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and south into the Caribbean islands and Central America.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the blue-winged teal was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Anas discors&quot;. A molecular phylogentic study comparing mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2009 found that the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. The genus was subsequently split into four monophyletic genera with ten species including the blue-winged teal moved into the resurrected genus &quot;Spatula&quot;. This genus had been originally proposed by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The name &quot;Spatula&quot; is the Latin for a &quot;spoon&quot; or &quot;spatula&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;discors&quot; is the Latin for &quot;different&quot; or &quot;at variance&quot;.

==Description==
The blue-winged teal is long, with a wingspan of , and a weight of . The adult male has a greyish blue head with a white facial crescent, a light brown body with a white patch near the rear and a black tail. The adult female is mottled brown, and has a whitish area at base of bill. Both sexes have sky-blue wing coverts, a green speculum, and yellow legs. They have two molts per year and a third molt in their first year. The call of the male is a short whistle; the female&#x27;s call is a soft quack.

==Distribution==
The range is all of North America except western and northern Alaska, northern Yukon Territory, northern Northwest Territories and the northeastern area of Canada. Blue-winged teal are rare in the desert southwest, and the west coast. The breeding habitat of the blue-winged teal is marshes and ponds.

The breeding range extends from east-central Alaska and southern Mackenzie District east to southern Quebec and southwestern Newfoundland. In the contiguous United States it breeds from northeast California east to central Louisiana, central Tennessee, and the Atlantic Coast. The western blue-winged teal inhabits that part of the breeding range west of the Appalachian Mountains. Some populations of blue-winged teals nest along the Atlantic Coast from New Brunswick to Pea Island, North Carolina.

They migrate in flocks to winter in to the south of its breeding range. During migration, some birds may fly long distances over open ocean. They are occasional vagrants to Europe, where their yellow legs are a distinction from other small ducks like the common teal and garganey, and in recent years have been annual vagrants in Britain and Ireland. The blue-winged teal winters from southern California to western and southern Texas, the Gulf Coast to the Atlantic Coast, the Caribbean, and south to Central and South America. It is often seen wintering as far south as Brazil and central Chile.

==Habitat==
Blue-winged teal inhabit shoreline more often than open water and prefer calm water or sluggish currents to fast water. They inhabit inland marshes, lakes, ponds, pools, and shallow streams with dense emergent vegetation. In coastal areas, breeding occurs in salt-marsh meadows with adjoining ponds or creeks. Blue-winged teal use rocks protruding above water, muskrat houses, trunks or limbs of fallen trees, bare stretches of shoreline, or mud flats for resting sites.

Blue-winged teal winter on shallow inland freshwater marshes and brackish and saltwater marshes. They build their nests on dry ground in grassy sites such as bluegrass meadows, hayfields, and sedge meadows. They will also nest in areas with very short, sparse vegetation. Blue-winged teal generally nest within several hundred yards of open water; however, nests have been found as far as away from water. Where the habitat is good, they nest communally.

Blue-winged teal often use heavy growth of bulrushes and cattails as escape cover. Grasses, sedges, and hayfields provide nesting cover for these ducks. Erik Fritzell reported that blue-winged teal nests located in light to sparse cover were more successful than those in heavy cover. Nesting success was 47% on grazed areas and 14% on ungrazed areas.

The blue-winged teal is primarily found in the northern prairies and parklands. It is the most abundant duck in the mixed-grass prairies of the Dakotas and the prairie provinces of Canada. The blue-winged teal is also found in wetlands of boreal forest associations, shortgrass prairies, tallgrass prairies, and deciduous woodlands.

This duck commonly inhabits wetland communities dominated by bulrush (&quot;Scirpus&quot; spp.), cattail (&quot;Typha&quot; spp.), pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton&quot; spp.), sedges (&quot;Carex&quot; spp.), widgeongrass (&quot;Ruppia maritima&quot;), and other emergent and aquatic vegetation. During molting, it often remains among extensive beds of bulrushes and cattails. The blue-winged teal favors areas dominated by bluegrass (&quot;Poa&quot; spp.) for nesting. Hayfields and plant communities of buckbrush (&quot;Ceonothus cuneatus&quot;) and sedges are also important as nest sites.

==Behavior==
These birds feed by dabbling in shallow water at the edge of marshes or open water. They mainly eat plants; their diet may include molluscs and aquatic insects.

Blue-winged teal are generally the first ducks south in the fall and the last ones north in the spring. Adult drakes depart the breeding grounds well before adult hens and immatures. Most blue-winged teal flocks seen after mid-September are composed largely of adult hens and immatures. The northern regions experience a steady decline in blue-winged teal populations from early September until early November. Blue-winged teal in central migration areas tend to remain through September, then diminish rapidly during October, with small numbers remaining until December. Large numbers of blue-winged teal appear on wintering grounds in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas in September.

===Reproduction===
The onset of courtship among immature blue-winged teal often starts in late January or early February. In areas south of the breeding grounds, blue-winged teal are more active in courtship during the spring migration than are most other ducks.

Blue-winged teal are among the last dabbling ducks to nest, generally nesting between April 15 and May 15. Few nests are started after mid-July. Chronology of nesting can vary from year to year as a result of weather conditions. At Delta Marshes, Manitoba, blue-winged teal nesting was delayed a week in 1950 due to abnormally cold weather. The nest is a shallow depression on the ground lined with grass and down, usually surrounded by vegetation.

Blue-winged teal generally lay 10 to 12 eggs. Delayed nesting and renesting efforts have substantially smaller clutches, averaging five to six eggs. Clutch size can also vary with the age of the hen. Yearlings tend to lay smaller clutches. Incubation takes 21 to 27 days. Blue-winged teal are sexually mature after their first winter. During incubation, the drake leaves its mate and moves to suitable molting cover where it becomes flightless for a period of 3 to 4 weeks.

Blue-winged teal ducklings can walk to water within 12 hours after hatching but do not fledge until 6 to 7 weeks.

===Food habits===

Blue-winged teal are surface feeders and prefer to feed on mud flats, in fields, or in shallow water where there is floating and shallowly submerged vegetation plus abundant small aquatic animal life. They mostly eat vegetative matter consisting of seeds or stems and leaves of sedge, grass, pondweed, smartweed (&quot;Polygonum&quot; spp.), duckweed (&quot;Lemna&quot; spp.), Widgeongrass, and muskgrass (&quot;Chara&quot; spp.). The seeds of plants that grow on mud flats, such as nutgrass (&quot;Cyperus&quot; spp.), smartweed, millet (&quot;Panicum&quot; spp.), and Rice Cut-grass (&quot;Leersia oryzoides&quot;), are avidly consumed by this duck. One-fourth of the food consumed by blue-winged teal is animal matter such as mollusks, crustaceans, and insects.

==Predators==
Common predators of blue-winged teal include humans, snakes, snapping turtles (&quot;Chleydra serpentina&quot;), dogs, cats, muskellunge (&quot;Esox masquinongy&quot;), American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), magpies (&quot;Pica&quot; spp.), ground squirrels, coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes fulva&quot;), gray foxes (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), long-tailed weasels (&quot;Mustela frenata&quot;), American minks (&quot;Mustela vison&quot;), striped skunks (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;), spotted skunks (&quot;Spilogale putorius&quot;), and American badgers (&quot;Taxidea taxus&quot;).

During one study, about half of the nest failures of blue-winged teal were caused by mammals. Striped and Spotted Skunks were responsible for two-thirds of these losses. All nest losses caused by birds were attributed to either crows or magpies.

<doc id="251177" wikidata="Q2694495" url="?curid=251177" title="Existence theorem">
<text>In mathematics, an existence theorem is a theorem which asserts the existence of a certain object. It might be a statement which begins with the phrase &quot;there exist(s)&quot;, or it might be a universal statement whose last quantifier is existential (e.g., &quot;for all , , ... there exist(s) ...&quot;). In the formal terms of symbolic logic, an existence theorem is a theorem with a prenex normal form involving the existential quantifier, even though in practice, such theorems are usually stated in standard mathematical language. For example, the statement that the sine function is continuous everywhere, or any theorem written in big O notation, can be considered as theorems which are existential by nature—since the quantification can be found in the definitions of the concepts used.

A controversy that goes back to the early twentieth century concerns the issue of purely theoretic existence theorems, that is, theorems which depend on non-constructive foundational material such as the axiom of infinity, the axiom of choice or the law of excluded middle. Such theorems provide no indication as to how to construct (or exhibit) the object whose existence is being claimed. From a constructivist viewpoint, such approaches are not viable as it leads to mathematics losing its concrete applicability, while the opposing viewpoint is that abstract methods are far-reaching, in a way that numerical analysis cannot be.

==&#x27;Pure&#x27; existence results==
In mathematics, an existence theorem is purely theoretical if the proof given for it does not indicate a construction of the object whose existence is asserted. Such a proof is non-constructive, since the whole approach may not lend itself to construction. In terms of algorithms, purely theoretical existence theorems bypass all algorithms for finding what is asserted to exist. These are to be contrasted with the so-called &quot;constructive&quot; existence theorems, which many constructivist mathematicians working in extended logics (such as intuitionistic logic) believe to be intrinsically stronger than their non-constructive counterparts.

Despite that, the purely theoretical existence results are nevertheless ubiquitous in contemporary mathematics. For example, John Nash&#x27;s original proof of the existence of a Nash equilibrium in 1951 was such an existence theorem. An approach which is constructive was also later found in 1962.

==Constructivist ideas==
From the other direction, there has been considerable clarification of what constructive mathematics is—without the emergence of a &#x27;master theory&#x27;. For example, according to Errett Bishop&#x27;s definitions, the continuity of a function such as should be proved as a constructive bound on the modulus of continuity, meaning that the existential content of the assertion of continuity is a promise that can always be kept. Accordingly, Bishop rejects the standard idea of pointwise continuity, and proposed that continuity should be defined in terms of &quot;local uniform continuity&quot;. One could get another explanation of existence theorem from type theory, in which a proof of an existential statement can come only from a &quot;term&quot; (which one can see as the computational content).

** Eastern bluebonnet, &quot;Northiella haematogaster&quot;
** Naretha bluebonnet, &quot;Northiella narethae&quot;
* Genus &quot;Psephotus&quot;
** Red-rumped parrot, &quot;Psephotus haematonotus&quot;
* Genus &quot;Psephotellus&quot;
** Mulga parrot, &quot;Psephotellus varius&quot;
** Golden-shouldered parrot, &quot;Psephotellus chrysoptergius&quot;
** Hooded parrot, &quot;Psephotellus dissimilis&quot;
** Paradise parrot, &quot;Psephotellus pulcherrimus&quot;† (extinct, late 1920s)

The budgerigar was traditionally placed in this tribe, but this inclusion is incorrect. The closest relatives of the budgerigar are the lories and lorikeets. The genera &quot;Neopsephotus&quot;, &quot;Neophema&quot;, and &quot;Pezoporus&quot; are placed in a separate, but closely related tribe, the Pezoporini based on the paper by Joseph et al. (2011)

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (also written &quot;&quot;, Comorian for &quot;The Union of the Great Islands&quot;; also known as &quot;&#x27;&quot;, sometimes written &quot;&quot;) is the national anthem of the Comoros. Adopted in 1978, it was written by Said Hachim Sidi Abderemane, who also composed the music with Kamildine Abdallah.

Mayotte (claimed by the Comoros but under French administration) is also mentioned in the song.

==History==
The anthem replaced a previous anthem titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Liberty&quot;), also known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Four Comorian Islands&quot;), adopted in 1976 under the Ali Soilih administration following a competition won by writer and musician Abou Chihabi. It was used until 1978, when a coup by Ahmed Abdallah and Bob Denard took place.

<text>In Islam, a houri (; ), or houris or hoor al ayn in plural form, is a maiden woman with beautiful eyes who lives alongside the Muslim faithful in paradise.

They are described as the same age as the men in paradise. Since hadith states people will be aged 30–33 lunar years in heaven, this translates to 29–32 Gregorian solar years.

The term &quot;houris&quot; is used four times in the Quran, although the houris are mentioned indirectly several other times, (sometimes as &quot;azwāj&quot;, lit. companions), and hadith provide a &quot;great deal of later elaboration&quot;. Muslim scholars differ as to whether they refer to the believing women of this world or a separate creation, with the majority opting for the latter.

Houris have been said to have &quot;captured the imagination of Muslims and non-Muslims alike&quot;. According to hadith, faithful women of the Dunya will be superior to houris in paradise.

== Etymology ==
In classical Arabic usage, the word () is the plural of both () (masculine) and () (feminine) which can be translated as &quot;having eyes with an intense contrast of white and black&quot;.

The word &quot;houri&quot; entered several European languages in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Arthur Jeffery and other scholars suggests an Iranian origin for the term, proposing the origins of the word to be the Middle Persian hū̆rust &#x27;well grown.&#x27;

== Descriptions ==
The houris are mentioned in several passages of the Quran, always in plural form, but only mentioned directly four times. No specific number is ever given in the Quran for the number of houris accompanying each believer.

=== Quranic description ===
In the tafsirs and commentaries on the Quran, Houris are described as:

* 37:48 &quot;with large and beautiful eyes&quot;,
* 38:52 &quot;companions of modest gaze well matched&quot;,
* 44:54 &quot;wide and beautiful eyes&quot;,
* 52:20 &quot;beautiful houris of wide and beautiful eyes&quot;,
* 55:56 &quot;untouched beforehand by man or jinn&quot;,
* 55:58 &quot;as elegant as rubies and coral&quot;,
* 55:72 &quot;bright-eyed damsels sheltered in pavilions&quot;,
* 55:74 &quot;untouched by any man&quot;, &quot;reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets&quot;,
* 56:8 &quot;the people of the right, how ˹blessed˺ will they be&quot; 56:22 and they will have &quot;houris maidens with intensely black eyes set against the whiteness of their irises&quot;,
* 56:35 &quot;created without the process of birth&quot;,
* 78:31–33 and as &quot;splendid companions&quot;,
* 44:54 &quot;Thus. And We will marry them to fair women with large, [beautiful] eyes&quot;.

It is thought that the four verses specifically mentioning Houri were all &quot;probably&quot; &#x27;revealed&#x27; at &quot;the end of the first Meccan period&quot;.

===Hadith description===
Details of descriptions of houri (or ḥūr), in hadith collections differ, but one summary (by Smith &amp; Haddad) states:they are generally said to be composed of saffron from the feet to the knees, musk from the knees to the breast, amber from the breast to the neck, and camphor from the neck to the head. Working often with multiples of seven, the traditionalists have described them as wearing seventy to 70,000 gowns, through which even the marrow of their bones can be seen because of the fineness of their flesh, reclining on seventy couches of red hyacinth encrusted with rubies and jewels, and the like. The ḥūr do not sleep, do not get pregnant, do not menstruate, spit, or blow their noses, and are never sick.In hadith, Houris have been described as &quot;transparent to the marrow of their bones&quot;, &quot;eternally young&quot;, &quot;hairless except the eyebrows and the head&quot;, &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot;. Sunni hadith scholars also relate a number of sayings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad in which the houris are mentioned.

* A narration related by Bukhari states that
* Another, reported by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri, relates that
* Al-Tirmidhi reports
* According to a report transmitted by Ibn Majah in his &quot;Sunan&quot;:

===Characteristics===
====Meaning of the term &quot;kawa&#x27;ib&quot;====
Verse Q.78:33 describes Houri with the noun &quot;ka&#x27;ib&quot;, translated as &quot;with swelling breasts&quot; by several translators—like Arberry, Palmer, Rodwell and Sale (it is also translated as &quot;buxom&quot; or &quot;full bosomed&quot;). At least two Islamic Fatwa sites (islamweb.net and islamqa.info) have attacked the use of these translations by those who &quot;criticize the Quran&quot;, or who &quot;seek to make Islam appear to be a religion of sex and desire&quot;.

Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir, writes that &quot;kawa&#x27;ib&quot; has been interpreted to refer to &quot;fully developed&quot; or &quot;round breasts ... they meant by this that the breasts of these girls will be fully rounded and not sagging, because they will be virgins.&quot; Similarly, the authoritative Arabic–English Lexicon of Edward William Lane defines the word &quot;ka&#x27;ib&quot; as &quot;A girl whose breasts are beginning to swell, or become prominent, or protuberant or having swelling, prominent, or protuberant, breasts.&quot;

However, M. A. S. Abdel Haleem and others point out that the description here refers in classical usage to the young age rather than emphasizing the women&#x27;s physical features. Others, such as Abdullah Yusuf Ali, translate &quot;ka&#x27;ib&quot; as &quot;companions&quot;, with Muhammad Asad interpreting the term as being allegorical.

==== Reference to &quot;72 virgins&quot; ====
The Sunni hadith scholar Al-Tirmidhi quotes Muhammad as having said:

However, others object that the narration granting all men seventy-two wives has a weak chain of narrators.

Another hadith, also in &quot;Jami at-Tirmidhi&quot; and deemed &quot;good and sound&quot; (&quot;hasan sahih&quot;) gives this reward specifically for the martyr:

(This hadith is sometimes erroneously attributed to the Quran.)

====Sexual intercourse in Paradise====
In the Quran, there is no overt mention of sexual intercourse in Paradise. However, it is alluded to in hadiths, tafsirs and Islamic commentaries.

====Houri, age====
The virgins of paradise &quot;they will be of one age, thirty-three years old,&quot; according to Ibn Kathir (as reported by Ad-Dahhak aka Ibn Abi Asim), based on his interpretation of the word &quot;Atrab&quot; () in Q.56:37).

However, another interpretation of &quot;Atrab&quot; (in Q.56:37 and also Q.78:33) by Muhammad Haleen, describes Houri &quot;as being of similar age to their companions&quot;. An Islamic Books pamphlet also states Houri will &quot;have the same age as their husbands so that they can relate to each other better&quot;, but also adds that they will &quot;never become old&quot;; (Translations of Q.56:37 and Q.78:33—for example by Mustafa Khattab&#x27;s the Clear Quran and by Pickthall—often include the phrase &quot;equal age&quot; but do not specify what the houris are of equal age to.) 

On the other hand, the houris were created &quot;without the process of birth&quot;, according to a classical Sunni interpretation of Q.56:35 in Tafsir al-Jalalayn, so that the heavenly virgins have no birthday or age in the earthly sense.

Other sources, including a tafsir of Ibn Kathir, (see above) emphasize the purpose of the use of &quot;kawa&#x27;ib&quot; in verse Q.78:33 &quot;is to highlight the woman’s youthfulness&quot;, though she is an adult, she &quot;has reached the age when she begins to menstruate&quot;; and that she is of the age of &quot;young girls when their breasts are beginning to appear&quot;. At least one person (M Faroof Malik) translates in verse Q.55:56 as &quot;bashful virgins&quot;.

===Quranic commentators===
Sunni sources mention that like all men and women of Paradise, the houris do not experience urination, defecation or menstruation.

Ibn Kathir states that jinns will have female jinn companions in Paradise.

====Contemporary====
According to Smith and Haddad, if there is any generalization that can be made of &quot;contemporary attitudes&quot; toward the nature of the hereafter, including Houri, it is that it is &quot;beyond human comprehension ... beyond time&quot;, that the Quran only &quot;alluded to analogously&quot;.

====Imam Reza====
According to 8th Shia Imam, Imam Reza, the heavenly spouses are created of dirt (Creation of life from clay) and saffron.

==Gender and identity==
It has traditionally been believed that the houris are beautiful women who are promised as a reward to believing men, with numerous &quot;hadith&quot; and Quranic exegetes describing them as such. In recent years, however, some have argued that the term &quot;ḥūr&quot; refers both to pure men and pure women (it being the plural term for both the masculine and feminine forms which refer to whiteness) and the belief that the term houris only refers to females who are in paradise is a misconception.

The Quran uses feminine as well as gender-neutral adjectives to describe houris, by describing them with the indefinite adjective , which some have taken to imply that certain passages are referring to both male and female companions. In addition, the use of masculine pronouns for the houris&#x27; companions does not imply that this companionship is restricted to men, as the masculine form encompasses the female in classical and Quranic Arabic—thus functioning as an all-gender including default form—and is used in the Quran to address all humanity and all the believers in general. 

In &quot;The Message of The Qur&#x27;an&quot;, Muhammad Asad describes the usage of the term &quot;ḥūr&quot; in the verses 44:54 and 56:22, arguing that &quot;the noun ḥūr—rendered by me as &#x27;companions pure&#x27;—is a plural of both &quot;aḥwār&quot; (masc.) and &quot;ḥawrā&quot;&#x27; (fem.)... hence, the compound expression ḥūr ʿīn signifies, approximately, &#x27;pure beings, most beautiful of eye&#x27;.&quot;

Annemarie Schimmel says that the Quranic description of the houris should be viewed in a context of love: &quot;every pious man who lives according to God&#x27;s order will enter Paradise where rivers of milk and honey flow in cool, fragrant gardens and virgin beloveds await home&quot;.

===Relation to earthly women===
Regarding the eschatological status of this-worldly women vis-à-vis the houris, scholars have maintained that righteous women of this life are of a higher station than the houris. Sunni theologian Aḥmad al-Ṣāwī (d. 1825), in his commentary on Ahmad al-Dardir&#x27;s work, states, &quot;The sound position is that the women of this world will be seventy thousand times better than the dark-eyed maidens (&quot;ḥūr ʿīn&quot;).&quot; Muḥammad ibn ʿUmar Baḥraq (d.1524) mentions in his didactic primer for children that &quot;Adamic women are better than the dark-eyed maidens due to their prayer, fasting, and devotions.&quot;

Other authorities appear to indicate that houris themselves are the women of this world resurrected in new form, with Razi commenting that among the houris mentioned in the Quran will also be &quot;[even] those toothless old women of yours whom God will resurrect as new beings&quot;. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari mentions that all righteous women, however old and decayed they may have been on earth, will be resurrected as virginal maidens and will, like their male counterparts, remain eternally young in paradise. Modernist scholar Muḥammad ʿAbduh states &quot;the women of the Garden are the good believers [&quot;al-mu&#x27;mināt al-ṣalihāt&quot;] known in the Qur&#x27;an as &quot;al-ḥūr al-ʿayn&quot;, (although he also makes a distinction between earthly women and houri).

Verses that are thought to refer to women from earth in paradise (Q.2:25, 3:15, and 4:57) talk of &quot;purified companions&quot; [&quot;azwāj muṭahhara&quot;], which distinguishes them from ḥūr, who are by definition &quot;pure rather than purified&quot;.

==Symbolism==
Muhammad Asad believes that the references to houris and other depictions of paradise should be understood as allegorical rather than literal, citing the &quot;impossibility of man&#x27;s really &#x27;imagining&#x27; paradise&quot;. In support of this view he quotes Quran verse 32:17 and a hadith found in Bukhari and Muslim.

Shi&#x27;ite philosopher Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai mentions that the most important fact of the description of the houris is that good deeds performed by believers are re-compensated by the houris, who are the physical manifestations of ideal forms that will not fade away over time and who will serve as faithful companions to those whom they accompany.

According to Islamic scholar Javed Ahmad Ghamidi the houri is just an adjective used to describe beauty of women from this world, who would be given a new beautiful appearance in afterlife. 

==Similarities to Zoroastrianism==
The houri has been said to resemble afterlife figures in Zoroastrianism narratives:The Zoroastrian text, Hadhoxt Nask, describes the fate of a soul after death. The soul of the righteous spends three nights near the corpse, and at the end of the third night, the soul sees its own religion (daena) in the form of a beautiful damsel, a lovely fifteen year-old virgin; thanks to good actions she has grown beautiful; they then ascend heaven together.

<doc id="251182" wikidata="Q28106764" url="?curid=251182" title="Cinnamon teal">
<text>The cinnamon teal (Spatula cyanoptera) is a species of duck found in western North and South America. It is a small dabbling duck, with bright reddish plumage on the male and duller brown plumage on the female. It lives in marshes and ponds, and feeds mostly on plants.

== Description ==
The adult male has a cinnamon-red head and body with a brown back, a red eye and a dark bill. The adult female has a mottled brown body, a pale brown head, brown eyes and a grey bill and is very similar in appearance to a female blue-winged teal; however, its overall color is richer, the lores, eye line, and eye ring are less distinct. Its bill is longer and more spatulate. Male juvenile resembles a female cinnamon or blue-winged teal but their eyes are red. They are long, have a wingspan, and weigh . They have 2 adult molts per year and a third molt in their first year.

== Distribution ==
Their breeding habitat is marshes and ponds in western United States and extreme southwestern Canada, and are rare visitors to the east coast of the United States. One young male duck was spotted in Grimsby, Ontario, and became a tourist attraction due to its rarity outside of western Canada. Cinnamon teal generally select new mates each year. They are migratory and most winter in northern South America and the Caribbean, generally not migrating as far as the blue-winged teal. Some winter in California and southwestern Arizona. Two subspecies of cinnamon teal reside within the Andes of South America. The smaller sized &quot;S. c. cyanoptera&quot; is widespread within low elevations (&lt;1000m) such as the coast of Peru and southern Argentina, whereas the larger size subspecies &quot;S. c. orinomus&quot; occupies elevations of 3500–4600 meters in the central Andes.

== Behavior ==
These birds feed by dabbling. They mainly eat plants; their diet may also include molluscs and aquatic insects.

== Taxonomy ==
They are known to interbreed with blue-winged teals, which are very close relatives.

Subspecies are:

* &quot;Spatula cyanoptera septentrionalium&quot; (Oberholser, 1906) northern cinnamon teal breeds from British Columbia to northwestern New Mexico, and they winter in northwestern South America.
* &quot;Spatula cyanoptera tropica&quot; (Snyder &amp; Lumsden, 1951) tropical cinnamon teal occurs in the Cauca Valley and Magdalena Valley in Colombia.
* &quot;Spatula cyanoptera borreroi&quot; (Snyder &amp; Lumsden, 1951) Borrero&#x27;s cinnamon teal (possibly extinct) occurs in the eastern Andes of Colombia with records of apparently resident birds from northern Ecuador. It is named for Colombian ornithologist José Ignacio Borrero.
* &quot;Spatula cyanoptera orinoma&quot; (Snyder &amp; Lumsden, 1951) Andean cinnamon teal occurs in the Altiplano of Peru, northern Chile and Bolivia.
* &quot;Spatula cyanoptera cyanoptera&quot; (Vieillot, 1816) Argentine cinnamon teal occurs in southern Peru, southern Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and the Falkland Islands.

<doc id="251183" wikidata="Q353879" url="?curid=251183" title="Jean François Paul de Gondi">
<text>Jean François Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz (20 September 1613 – 24 August 1679) was a French churchman, writer of memoirs, and agitator in the Fronde.

The Florentine banking and noble Gondi family had been introduced into France by Catherine de&#x27; Medici; Catherine offered Jérome (Girolamo) de Gondi in 1573 the château that he made the nucleus of the Château de Saint-Cloud; his hôtel in the Faubourg Saint-Germain of Paris became the Hôtel de Condé in the following generation. The Gondi acquired great estates in Brittany and became connected with the noblest houses of the kingdom.

== Early life ==
Jean-François de Gondi was born in Montmirail, in the Brie region of northern France. He was the third son in his family, and according to Tallemant des Réaux was made a knight of Malta on the very day of his birth. The death of his second brother, however, destined him for a closer connection with the Church. The Retz side of his family had much church influence, and though young Jean-François was not much attracted to the clergy, his family insisted that he join it. They said he lacked the appearance of a soldier, being short, near-sighted, ugly and awkward.

He was tutored by St. Vincent de Paul and educated at the Sorbonne. When he was eighteen, he wrote &quot;Conjuration de Fiesque&quot;, a little historical essay, influenced by the Italian of Agostino Mascardi, and audaciously insinuating revolutionary principles.

== Family background ==

The district of Retz or Rais is in southern Brittany, and has been under the control of several different families. Retz always spelled the word &quot;Rais.&quot; The barony of Retz first belonged to the House of Retz, then to the Chabot family and the Laval family. Gilles de Rais, a Laval and comrade in arms of Joan of Arc, was executed without an heir, so the barony passed successively to the families of Tournemine, Annebaut and Gondi.

In 1581, it became a duchy, with Albert de Gondi its first duke. His brother Pierre de Gondi became bishop of Paris in 1570 and cardinal in 1587. Pierre was succeeded by his nephews Henri de Gondi (d. 1622) and Jean-François de Gondi (d. 1654), for whom the episcopal see of Paris was erected into an archbishopric in 1622. Finally, Jean François was then succeeded by Pierre&#x27;s great-nephew Jean François Paul de Gondi.

== Archbishop of Paris ==

Retz received no preferment of importance during Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s life. Even after the minister&#x27;s death, though he was presented to Louis XIII and well received, he found difficulty in attaining the co-adjutorship with reversion of the archbishopric of Paris. But almost immediately after the king&#x27;s death, Anne of Austria appointed him to the coveted post on All Saints Eve, 1643. Retz, who had, according to some accounts, already plotted against Richelieu, set himself to work to make the utmost political capital out of his position. His uncle had lived in great seclusion; Retz, on the contrary, gradually acquired a very great influence with the populace of the city. This influence he gradually turned against Cardinal Mazarin, which helped lead to the outbreak of the Fronde in October 1648.

Of the two parties who joined the Fronde, Retz could only depend on the bourgeoisie of Paris. He had some speculative tendencies in favour of popular liberties, and even perhaps of republicanism, but represented no real political principle, which inevitably weakened his position. When the breakup of the Fronde came he was left in the lurch, having more than once been in no small danger from his own party. However, because of a misapprehension on the part of Pope Innocent X, he had been made cardinal.

In 1652, he was arrested and imprisoned, first at Vincennes, then at Nantes; he escaped after two years, and traveled through Europe. He went to Rome more than once, and helped elect Pope Alexander VII. In 1662, Louis XIV received him back into favor, and asked him to formally serve as envoy to Rome several times. For this reconciliation to occur, he resigned his claims to the archbishopric of Paris. He was appointed abbot of St-Denis, and restored to his other benefices with the payment of arrears.

== Later life ==

The last seventeen years of Retz&#x27;s life were passed partly in his diplomatic duties (he was again in Rome at the papal conclaves of 1667 and 1669), partly in Paris, partly at his estate of Cornmercy, but mostly at Saint-Mihiel in Lorraine. His debts were enormous, and in 1675 he made over to his creditors all his income except twenty thousand &quot;livres&quot;. He died at Paris on 24 August 1679. During these last years he corresponded with Madame de Sévigné, a relative by marriage.

== Writings ==
During the last ten years of his life, Retz wrote his &quot;Memoirs,&quot; which go up to the year 1655. They are addressed in the form of narrative to a lady who is not known, though guesses have been made at her identity, some even suggesting Madame de Sévigné herself. In the beginning there are some gaps. They are known for their narrative skill and the verbal portraits of their characters. Alexandre Dumas, père drew heavily on the &quot;Memoirs&quot; for &quot;Vingt ans après&quot;. Besides these memoirs and the youthful essay of the &quot;Conjuration de Fiesque&quot;, Retz has left diplomatic papers, sermons, &quot;Mazarinades&quot; and correspondence.

Retz and François de La Rochefoucauld, the greatest of the &quot;Frondeurs&quot; in literary genius, were personal and political enemies, and each left a portrait of the other. De la Rochefoucauld wrote of Retz: &quot;Il a suscité les plus grands désordres dans l&#x27;état sans avoir un dessein formé de s&#x27;en prévaloir.&quot; (He stirred up the greatest disorder in the State, without having a clear plan of how to gain from it).

The &quot;Memoirs of the cardinal de Retz&quot; were first published in a very imperfect condition in 1717. The first satisfactory edition appeared in the twenty-fourth volume of the collection of Joseph François Michaud and Jean Joseph François Poujoulat (Paris, 1836). In 1870 a complete edition of the works of Retz was begun by Alphonse Feillet in the collection of &quot;Grands Ecrivains&quot;.

Perhaps his most famous quotation with respect to modern culture was from Vol 2. of his Memoirs, discussing the unrest in the day, with a philosophical reflection,&quot;Il n’y a rien dans ce monde qui n’ait un moment decisif...&quot; (There is nothing in the world that does not have its decisive moment...)

The full translated passage goes on:
&quot;It seemed that everyone was surprised and intoxicated by the smoke of the grape harvest; and you will see scenes at the cost of which the past has been nothing but greenery and pastures. There is nothing in the world that does not have its decisive moment, and the masterpiece of good conduct is know and take this moment. If we miss it in the revolution of States, we run the risk of not finding it, or of not noticing it.&quot; 

Henri Cartier-Bresson used this passage as the keynote to his classic work &quot;Images à la Sauvette&quot; which was renamed in English &quot;The Decisive Moment.&quot;

<text>Tübingen is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Böblingen, Reutlingen, Zollernalbkreis and Freudenstadt.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Tübingen&quot; in the state of Württemberg. In 1811 the &quot;Oberamt Rottenburg&quot; was created, and both were converted into districts in 1934. In 1938 most of the district Rottenburg as well as a few municipalities from the district Herrenberg and Reutlingen were added to the district Tübingen. In 1974 it was enlarged again when some municipalities from the dissolved district Horb were added.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Neckar. The landscapes covered by the district are called &quot;Oberer Gäu&quot; and &quot;Schönbuch&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show the banner (gonfalon) of the Counts of Tübingen. In contrast to the coat of arms of the city Tübingen, it is depicted on a spear. The red-and-white colors are chosen to represent the County Hohenberg, which belonged to Austria.

<doc id="251188" wikidata="Q165494" url="?curid=251188" title="Adhan">
<text>The  (, ) is the Islamic call to prayer, usually recited by a muezzin, traditionally from the minaret of a mosque, shortly before each of the five obligatory daily prayers. The adhan is also the first phrase said in the ear of a newborn baby, and often the first thing recited in a new home.

It is the first call summoning Muslims to enter the mosque for obligatory () prayers (); a second call, known as the , summons those already in the mosque to assemble for prayer. Muslims are encouraged to stop their activities and respond to the adhan by performing prescribed prayers, demonstrating reverence for the call to prayer and commitment to their faith.

The five prayer times are known in Arabic as (), (), (), (), and ().
In Turkey, they are called , and ; the five calls to prayer are sung in different makams, corresponding to the time of day.

== Terminology ==
, Arabic for &#x27;announcement&#x27;, from the root , meaning &#x27;to listen, to hear, be informed about&#x27;, is variously transliterated in different cultures.

It is commonly written as &quot;athan&quot;, or &quot;adhane&quot; (in French), &quot;azan&quot; in Iran and south Asia (in Persian, Dari, Pashto, Hindi, Bengali, Urdu, and Punjabi), &quot;adzan&quot; in Southeast Asia (Indonesian and Malaysian), and &quot;ezan&quot; in Turkish, Bosnian and Serbo-Croatian Latin (езан in Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic and Bulgarian, ezani in Albanian). Muslims in many parts of South Asia, including the Malabar Coast of India and the Punjab region of India and Pakistan, use the Persian term , , for the call to public prayer.

Another derivative of the word is (), meaning &#x27;ear&#x27;.

==Announcer==


The muezzin ( muʾaḏḏin) is the person who recites the adhan from the mosque. Typically in modern times, this is done using a microphone: a recitation that is consequently broadcast to the speakers usually mounted on the higher part of the mosque&#x27;s minarets, thus calling those nearby to prayer. However, in many mosques, the message can also be recorded. This is due to the fact that the &quot;call to prayer&quot; has to be done loudly and at least five times a day. This is usually done by replaying previously recorded &quot;call to prayer&quot; without the presence of a muezzin. This way, the mosque operator has the ability to edit or mix the message and adjust the volume of the message while also not having to hire a full-time muezzin or in case of the absence of a muezzin. This is why in many Muslim countries, the sound of the prayer call can be exactly identical between one mosque and another, as well as between one &quot;Salah&quot; hour and another, as is the case for the London Central Mosque. In the event of a religious holidays like &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot;, for example in Indonesia, where the &quot;Kalimah&quot; (speech) has to be recited out loud all day long, mosque operators use this recording method to create a looping recital of the &quot;Kalimah&quot;. 

The muezzin is chosen for his ability in reciting the adhan clearly, melodically, and loudly enough for all people to hear. This is one of the important duties in the mosque, as his companions and community rely on him in his call for Muslims to come to pray in congregation. The Imam leads the prayer five times a day. The first muezzin in Islam was Bilal ibn Rabah, a freed slave of Abyssinian heritage. According to Mawsuʿah al-Fiqhiyah, the muezzin should have an elegant voice too, and should be wise about the times of prayer and Islam.

==Words==
Repeating the two testimonies of faith is recommended according to the Shafi&#x27;i school. The first time should be said in low voice to oneself, and the second should be called out; this was the practice of the people of Mecca. The Maliki school uses the same adhan, except &quot;allāhu akbar&quot; should only be said twice in the beginning; this was the practice of the people of Medina. Both positions also use a narration in Sahih Muslim as evidence.

On rare occasions, the muezzin may say &quot;&quot;ṣallu fī buyūtikum&quot; (pray in your homes) or &quot;ṣallu fī riḥālikum&quot; (pray in your dwellings) if it is heavily rainy, windy, or cold. Another case where this was said was during the COVID-19 lockdown. It may either be said at the end of the adhan, or replacing &quot;ḥayya ʿala ṣ-ṣalāh&quot; and &quot;ḥayya ʿala l-falāḥ&quot;&quot;; other ways have also been narrated.

==Religious views==
===Shia===
Shia sources state Muhammad, according to God&#x27;s command, ordered the adhan as a means of calling Muslims to prayer. Shia Islam teaches that no one else contributed, or had any authority to contribute, towards the composition of the adhan.

Shia sources also narrate that Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi was, in fact, the first person to recite the adhan publicly out loud in front of the Muslim congregation.

The fundamental phrase &quot;lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāh&quot; is the foundation stone of Islam along with the belief in it. It declares that &quot;there is no god but Allah&quot;. This is the confession of &quot;Tawhid&quot; or the &quot;doctrine of Oneness [of God]&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Muḥammadun rasūlu -llāh&quot; fulfills the requirement that there should be someone to guide in the name of God, which states Muhammad is God&#x27;s Messenger. This is the acceptance of prophethood or &quot;Nabuwat&quot; of Muhammad.


According to the Shia belief, Muhammad declared Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor, at Ghadir Khumm, which was required for the continuation of his guidance. According to the hadith of the pond of Khumm, Muhammad stated that &quot;Of whomsoever I am the authority, Ali is his authority&quot;. Hence, it is recommended to recite the phrase &quot;ʿalīyun walī -llāh&quot; (&quot;Ali is His [God&#x27;s] Authority&quot;).

In one of the Qiblah of Ma&#x27;ad al-Mustansir Billah (1035–1094) of Fatemi era masjid of Qahira (Mosque of Ibn Tulun) engraved his name and &quot;kalimat ash-shahādah&quot; as &quot;lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāh, muḥammadun rasūlu -llāh, ʿalīyun walīyu -llāh&quot; ().

Adhan reminds Muslims of these three Islamic teaching &quot;Tawhid&quot;, &quot;Nabuwat&quot; and &quot;Imamate&quot; before each prayer. These three emphasise devotion to God, Muhammad and Imam, which are considered to be so linked together that they can not be viewed separately; one leads to other and finally to God.

The phrase is optional to some Shia as justified above. They feel that Ali&#x27;s &quot;Walayah&quot; (&quot;Divine Authority&quot;) is self-evident, a testification and need not be declared. However, the greatness of God is also taken to be self-evident, but Muslims still declare &quot;Allāhu ʾakbar&quot; to publicize their faith. This is the reason that the most Shia give for the recitation of the phrase regarding Ali.

===Sunni===

Sunnis believe that the adhan was not written or said by the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, but rather by one of his companions. Abdullah ibn Zayd, a companion of Muhammad, reportedly had a vision in his dream, in which the adhan was revealed to him by God. He related this to his companions; later, this news reached Muhammad, who confirmed it. Because of his stunning voice, Muhammad chose a freed Habeshan slave by the name of Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi to make the call for prayers. Muhammad preferred the call over the use of bells, used by Christians, and horns, used by Jews.
During the Friday prayer &quot;(Salat al-Jum&#x27;ah)&quot;, there is one adhan but some Sunni Muslims increase it to two adhans; the first is to call the people to the mosque, the second is said before the Imam begins the &quot;khutbah&quot; (sermon). Just before the prayers start, someone amongst the praying people recites the &quot;iqama&quot; as in all prayers. The basis for this is that at the time of the Caliph Uthman he ordered two adhans to be made, the first of which was to be made in the marketplace to inform the people that the Friday prayer was soon to begin, and the second adhan would be the regular one held in the mosque. Not all Sunnis prefer two adhans as the need for warning the people of the impending time for prayer is no longer essential now that the times for prayers are well known.

==Supplication==
===Shia===
While listening to the adhan, it is recommended to repeat the same words silently, except when the adhan reciter (muezzin) says: &quot; and &quot; (&quot;ʾašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāh and ʾašhadu ʾanna Muḥammadan rasūlu -llāh&quot;) they silently say:
Whenever Muhammad&#x27;s name is mentioned in the adhan or Iqama, it is recommended to recite salawat, a form of the peace be upon him blessing specifically for Muhammad. This salawat is usually recited as either &#x27; (), &#x27; (), or &quot;&quot; ().

Immediately following the adhan, it is recommended to sit and recite the following dua (supplication):
===Sunni===
While listening to the adhan, it is recommended to silently repeat after the caller, except when they say &quot;come to prayer&quot; (&quot;ḥayya ʿala ṣ-ṣalāh&quot;) and &quot;come to success&quot; (&quot;ḥayya ʿala l-falāḥ&quot;), to which it is recommended to silently say &quot;there is no ability and no power except by God, [the Most High, Most Great]&quot; (&quot;lā ḥawla wa-lā quwwata illā bi-llāh [l-ʿaliyyi l-ʿaẓīm]&quot;). Most scholars, including the Malikis, Shafi&#x27;is, and Hanbalis, view this as only recommended; however, others, including the Hanafis and Zahiris, view it as necessary.

Immediately following the adhan, it is recommended to recite the following supplications:

1. A testification of faith
2. Prayers and blessings on Muhammad and his family
3. Praying for Muhammad&#x27;s station and virtousness
4. Any personal supplication made to God between the adhan and iqamah. It was narrated this is a time when supplications are especially answered and not rejected.

==Form==
The call to prayer is said after entering the time of prayer. The muezzin usually stands during the call to prayer. It is common for the muezzin to put his hands to his ears when reciting the adhan. Each phrase is followed by a longer pause and is repeated one or more times according to fixed rules. During the first statement each phrase is limited in tonal range, less melismatic, and shorter. Upon repetition the phrase is longer, ornamented with melismas, and may possess a tonal range of over an octave. The adhan&#x27;s form is characterised by contrast and contains twelve melodic passages which move from one to another tonal center of one maqam a fourth or fifth apart. Various geographic regions in the Middle East traditionally perform the adhan in particular maqamat: Medina, Saudi Arabia uses Maqam Bayati while Mecca uses Maqam Hijaz. The tempo is mostly slow; it may be faster and with fewer melismas for the sunset prayer. During festivals, it may be performed antiphonally as a duet. Duration can be 1 minutes, but also longer, and then continuing with the shorter iqama.

== Modern legal status ==
=== Australia ===
There are controversies due to community-centric disagreements at mosques in Australia, such as ongoing parking disputes at Al Zahra in Arncliffe, noise complaints at Gallipoli Mosque and Lakemba Mosque in Sydney, and public filming at Albanian Australian Islamic Society and the Keysborough Turkish Islamic and Cultural Centre in Melbourne.

=== Bangladesh ===
In 2016, opposition leader Khaleda Zia alleged the government was preventing the broadcasting of adhans through loudspeakers, with government officials citing security concerns for the prime minister Sheikh Hasina&quot;.

=== Israel ===
In 2016, Israel&#x27;s ministerial committee approved a draft bill that limits the volume of the use of public address systems for calls to prayer, particularly outdoor loudspeakers for the adhan, citing it as a factor of noise pollution, the draft bill was never enacted and has been in limbo ever since. The bill was submitted by Knesset member Motti Yogev of the far right Zionist party Jewish Home and Robert Ilatov of the right wing Yisrael Beiteinu. The ban is meant to affect three mosques in Abu Dis village of East Jerusalem, disbarring them from broadcasting the morning call (fajr) prayers. The bill was backed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said: &quot;I cannot count the times — they are simply too numerous — that citizens have turned to me from all parts of Israeli society, from all religions, with complaints about the noise and suffering caused to them by the excessive noise coming to them from the public address systems of houses of prayer.&quot; The Israel Democracy Institute, a non-partisan think tank, expressed concerns that it specifically stifles the rights of Muslims, and restricts their freedom of religion.

=== Kuwait and the UAE ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait, some cities changed their adhan from the usual &quot;hayya &#x27;ala as-salah&quot;, meaning &quot;come to prayer&quot;, to &quot;as-salatu fi buyutikum&quot; meaning &quot;pray in your homes&quot; or &quot;ala sallu fi rihalikum&quot; meaning &quot;pray where you are&quot;.

Other Muslim countries (notably Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia) also made this change because Muslims are prohibited to pray in mosques during the pandemic as preventive measures to stop the chain of the outbreak. The basis for the authority to change a phrase in the adhan was justified by Muhammad&#x27;s (Peace be upon him) instructions while calling for adhan during adverse conditions.

=== Sweden ===
The Fittja Mosque in Botkyrka, south of Stockholm, was in 2013 the first mosque to be granted permission for a weekly public call to Friday prayer, on condition that the sound volume does not exceed 60 dB. In Karlskrona (province of Blekinge, southern Sweden) the Islamic association built a minaret in 2017 and has had weekly prayer calls since then. The temporary mosque in Växjö filed for a similar permission in February 2018, which sparked a nationwide debate about the practice. A yearlong permission was granted by the Swedish Police Authority in May the same year.

=== Tajikistan ===
The usage of loudspeakers to broadcast the adhan was banned in 2009 with &quot;Law No. 489 of 26 March 2009 on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Unions&quot;.

=== Turkey ===
As an extension of the reforms brought about by the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turkish government at the time, encouraged by Atatürk, introduced secularism to Turkey. The program involved implementing a Turkish adhan program as part of its goals, as opposed to the conventional Arabic call to prayer. Following the conclusion of said debates, on the 1 February 1932, the adhan was chanted in Turkish and the practice was continued for a period of 18 years. There was some resistance against the adhan in the Turkish language and protests surged. In order to suppress these protests, in 1941, a new law was issued, under which people who chanted the adhan in Arabic could be imprisoned for up to 3 months and be fined up to 300 Turkish Lira.

On 17 June 1950, a new government led by Adnan Menderes, restored Arabic as the liturgical language.

=== Uzbekistan ===
In 2005, former Uzbek president Islam Karimov banned the Muslim call to prayer from being broadcast in the country; the ban was lifted in November 2017 by his successor, Shavkat Mirziyoyev.

In other countries, there is no written law forbidding the distribution of the call to prayer in mosques and prayer halls.

==In popular culture==
=== In television ===
In some Muslim-majority countries, television stations usually broadcasts the adhan at prayer times, in a similar fashion to radio stations. In Indonesia and Malaysia, it is mandatory for all television stations to broadcast the adhan at Fajr and Magrib prayers, with the exception of non-Muslim religious stations. Islamic religious stations often broadcast the adhan at all five prayer times. Since the 1970s the adhan has been broadcast from mosques in the U.S., such as the American Moslem Society, which was established in Dearborn, Michigan.

The adhan are commonly broadcast with a visual cinematic sequence depicting mosques and worshippers attending to the prayer. Some television stations in both Malaysia and Indonesia often utilize a more artistic or cultural approach to the cinematic involving multiple actors and religious-related plotlines.

The 1991-1994 recording of Masjid al-Haram muezzin, &quot;Sheikh&quot; Ali Ahmed Mulla is best known for its use in various television and radio stations.

=== Turkish National Anthem ===
The adhan is referenced in the eighth verse of &quot;İstiklâl Marşı&quot;, the Turkish national anthem:

=== &quot;The Armed Man&quot; ===
The adhan appears in &quot;The Armed Man: A Mass For Peace&quot; composed by Karl Jenkins.

<doc id="251191" wikidata="Q927398" url="?curid=251191" title="Red-rumped parrot">
<text>The red-rumped parrot (Psephotus haematonotus), also known as the red-backed parrot or grass parrot, is a medium-sized broad-tailed parrot endemic to open woodland in south-eastern Australia, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a highly sexually dimorphic species, with the adult female mainly being a greyish olive-green with lighter underparts and the adult male predominantly being a brightly coloured green and gold with various shades of blue on the wings. Only the adult male possesses the red rump that gives the species its common name.

It is commonly found in open, grassy habitats, both in natural open woodland and in man-made environments such as paddocks, fields, parks and gardens. It has adapted well to rural and suburban areas and is commonly observed foraging on the ground for a variety of seeds.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The red-rumped parrot was described by John Gould in 1838 as &quot;Platycercus haematonotus&quot; from a specimen collected in New South Wales. He felt it was intermediate between the genera &quot;Platycercus&quot; and the now obsolete genus &quot;Nanodes&quot;, placing it in the former. He gave it its species name on account of its red rump. Gould later reclassified it as &quot;Psephotus haematonotus&quot; in his book, &quot;Birds of Australia,&quot; Volume 5.

It is the type species for the genus &quot;Psephotus&quot;. It was long presumed to be closely related to the mulga parrot, however analysis of multiple genetic material shows it to be an early offshoot of a group containing the genera &quot;Platycercus&quot; and &quot;Barnardius&quot;. Hence all other species in the genus have been moved to the new genus &quot;Psephotellus&quot;, leaving the red-rumped parrot as the sole member in the now monotypic genus.

The species name derives from Ancient Greek &quot;psephotos&quot;, meaning &quot;inlaid with pebbles&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;haematonotus&quot; stems from Greek &quot;haimato&quot;, meaning &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;noton&quot; meaning &quot;back&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;P. h. haematonotus&quot; (Gould, 1838) - the nominate subspecies. Found in south-eastern Australia throughout much of New South Wales and Victoria.
* &quot;P. h. caeruleus&quot; (Condon, 1941) - found further inland in north-eastern South Australia and south-western Queensland.

The IOC World Bird List has designated red-rumped parrot as its official common name. It is also commonly known as the red-backed parrot or grass parrot.

==Description==
Red-rumped parrots are slim, moderate-sized parrots measuring approximately in length and weighing between 45 and 77 grams.

The adult male&#x27;s plumage is mainly a bright emerald-green with yellow underparts. The mantle, upper back and scapulars are a dull green-blue. The lower back and rump is brick-red. blue highlights on the wings and upper back and bright yellow patches on the shoulders. The irises are light brown.

The adult female&#x27;s plumage is less vibrant, with pale olive underparts. The mantle, upper back and scapulars are a dull olive-green. The lower back and rump are lime-green. The irises are a light grey-brown. The characteristic red rump is only found in the male.

The plumage of juvenile males resemble females, except for their red rumps and light blue-green faces. Adults of both sexes have grey bills, being darker in the male, whereas immature birds have brown to yellow-brown bills. Both sexes have dark-grey flight feathers and dark blue underwing coverts, with blue outer wing tips visible in flight. An off-white white underwing bar is present on females of all ages and is retained in juvenile and immature males. The underwing bar is absent in males of approximately 2 years of age or older. A few months following fledging, juveniles will moult into adult-like plumage, retaining their flight and tail feathers. Moulting into the complete adult plumage begins when the birds are about 1 year old.

It is similar in appearance to the closely related mulga parrot (&quot;Psephotellus varius&quot;) which can be distinguished by its overall difference in colour, mainly the yellow band above its bill, red patch on the nape and smaller, darker red patch at the base of the tail which is present in both males and females. 

==Distribution and habitat==
Red-rumped parrots are widely distributed throughout lightly timbered plains, open woodland and other grassy habitats in south-eastern Australia below . Their range encompasses most of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as parts of southern Queensland and eastern South Australia. They avoid the coast and the wetter, more heavily wooded areas.

Subspecies &quot;caeruleus&quot; is only found far inland surrounding the Queensland-South Australia border.

They have adapted well to some urban and suburban areas and can be found in farmland, on roadside verges and in parks and gardens.

==Behaviour==
Red-rumped parrots are non-migratory, with local movements after the breeding season. They can be found in pairs or flocks, occasionally reaching numbers of up to 100 or more birds. They are most crepuscular, active during dawn and dusk and avoiding activity during the hottest times of day. They spend a great deal of time feeding on the ground, and often call to one another with an attractive . Their green plumage provides such a good camouflage in ankle length grasses that they can hide quite effectively until the viewer is only 10–20 metres away.

===Breeding===

Like many parrots, red-rumped parrots nest in tree hollows or similar places, including fenceposts and stumps. They lay 4-6 white eggs around 2 or so centimetres. Breeding usually takes place in spring (September–November); however, in the dryer inland areas, breeding can occur at any time of year in response to rainfall. They will begin to breed from between 12 and 18 months of age.

Red-rumped parrots are monogamous and pair for life. Both sexes defend the nest hollow. Incubation takes around 20–25 days and is done by the female alone. The father brings food to the mother while she incubates the eggs and feeds the chicks during their first few weeks of life, afterwards, feeding duties are undertaken by both parents. The fledging period begins when the chicks are 4–5 weeks of age.

Courtship involves a display where the male stretches out his body, fans out and wags his tail, bobs his head up and down and thrusts out his shoulders, exposing the bright yellow and blue wing patches. The display is followed by the male mutually feeding the female through regurgitation. Mutual preening may be observed in bonded pairs, although it is uncommon among broad-tailed parrots.

===Feeding===

The red-rumped parrot&#x27;s diet primarily consists of seeds and leaves of grasses and other herbaceous plants, both native and introduced. They may occasionally feed on small fruits, shoots and flowers. They predominantly feed on the ground in pairs or small flocks, and may be seen feeding with other seed-eating parrots such as galahs and eastern rosellas.

===Threats===
Currently, the red-rumped parrot is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and does not appear on the EPBC Act List of Threatened Fauna. Its population size has not been estimated, however it is believed to be increasing, and the species is reported to be common throughout its range.

Unlike many other Australian birds which are in decline due to land clearing and deforestation, the distribution and population of the red-rumped parrot are likely increasing as ongoing land clearing creates more suitable open habitat for the species.

Red-rumped parrots are often hit by cars and other vehicles when feeding on roadside verges, and are often killed by feral and outdoor cats. The introduced and invasive common myna (&quot;Acridotheres tristis&quot;) and European starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) regularly outcompete red-rumped parrots and other native hollow-nesting species for nest sites. A study published in 1997 reveals that these two introduced birds are the dominant occupiers of available nest hollows and show strong evidence that they reduce the breeding success of native species. In this study, red-rumped parrots were often outcompeted by both introduced species, as well as the native eastern rosella and crimson rosella.

==Aviculture==
Red-rumped parrots are becoming increasingly popular in aviculture due to their large range of attractive colour mutations and ease of care. They are incredibly hardy and can be kept in a variety of weather and climatic conditions. Compatible pairs breed readily in captivity if provided with necessary flight space and a large nesting box. They may raise up to four broods in a single season. Care must be taken to ensure parent birds do not display any signs of aggression towards their young once they have fledged.

===Housing===
Red-rumped parrots do well in aviaries and large cages. Only one male-female pair of red-rumps should be housed per enclosure, as these birds are known to be aggressive towards other birds, especially their own kind. Outdoor aviaries should provide ample shade and weatherproofing, as well as direct sunlight.

===Mutations===
Red-rumped parrots have been bred in a wide variety of colour mutations, with an estimated total of over 22 mutations available at present. These include cinnamon, lutino, pied, blue, albino and opaline.

===Lifespan===
In captivity, their average lifespan is 15 years, however, with proper feeding and care, these birds may live up to 32 years.

<text>Richard James Mulcahy (10 May 1886 – 16 December 1971) was an Irish Fine Gael politician and army general who served as Minister for Education from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957, Minister for the Gaeltacht from June 1956 to October 1956, Leader of the Opposition from 1944 to 1948, Leader of Fine Gael from 1944 to 1959, Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1927 to 1932 and Minister for Defence from January to April 1919 and 1922 to 1924. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1938 and from 1943 to 1961 and a Senator from March 1938 to June 1938 and 1943 to 1944. He served in the cabinets of W. T. Cosgrave and John A. Costello.

He was an army general who fought in the 1916 Easter Rising, served as Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence and became commander-in-chief of the National Army in the Irish Civil War after the death of Michael Collins.

==Early life and 1916 Rising==
Richard Mulcahy was born in Manor Street, Waterford, in 1886, the son of post office clerk Patrick Mulcahy and Elizabeth Slattery. He was educated at Mount Sion Christian Brothers School and later in Thurles, County Tipperary, where his father was the postmaster. One of his grandmothers was a Quaker who was disowned by her wealthy family for marrying a Catholic. 

Mulcahy joined the Royal Mail (Post Office Engineering Dept.) in 1902 and worked in Thurles, Bantry, Wexford and Dublin. He was a member of the Gaelic League and joined the Irish Volunteers at the time of their formation in 1913. He was also a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

He was second-in-command to Thomas Ashe (who later died on hunger strike) in an encounter with the armed Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) at Ashbourne, County Meath during the Easter Rising in 1916—one of the few stand-out victories won by republicans in that week, and generally credited to Mulcahy&#x27;s grasp of tactics. In his book on the Rising, Charles Townshend principally credits Mulcahy with the defeat of the RIC at Ashbourne, for conceiving and leading a flanking movement on the RIC column that had engaged with the Irish Volunteers. Arrested after the Rising, Mulcahy was interned at Knutsford and at the Frongoch internment camp in Wales until his release on 24 December 1916.

==War of Independence and Civil War==
On his release, Mulcahy immediately rejoined the republican movement and became commandant of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. He was elected to the First Dáil in the 1918 general election for Dublin Clontarf. He was then named Minister for Defence in the new (alternative) government and later Assistant Minister for Defence. In March 1918, he became IRA chief of staff, a position he held until January 1922.

He and Michael Collins were largely responsible for directing the military campaign against the British during the War of Independence. During this period of upheaval in 1919, he married Mary Josephine (Min) Ryan, sister of Kate and Phyllis Ryan, the successive wives of Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly; her brother was James Ryan. O&#x27;Kelly and James Ryan both later served in Fianna Fáil governments.

Mulcahy supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921. Archive film shows that Mulcahy, as Minister of Defence, was the Irish officer who raised the Irish tricolour at the first hand-over of a British barracks to the National Army in January 1922. He was defence minister in the Provisional Government on its creation and succeeded Collins, after the latter&#x27;s death, as Commander-in-Chief of the Provisional Government&#x27;s forces, during the subsequent Civil War.

He earned notoriety through his order that anti-Treaty activists captured carrying arms were liable for execution. A total of 77 anti-Treaty prisoners were executed by the Provisional Government. Mulcahy served as Minister for Defence in the new Free State government from January 1924 until March 1924, but resigned in protest because of the sacking of the Army Council after criticism by the Executive Council over the handling of the &#x27;Army Mutiny&#x27;, when some National Army War of Independence officers almost revolted after Mulcahy demobilised many of them at the end of the Civil War. He re-entered the cabinet as Minister for Local Government and Public Health in 1927.

==Post-independence politician==
During his period on the backbenches of Dáil Éireann his electoral record fluctuated. He was elected as TD for Dublin North-West at the 1921 and 1922 general elections. He moved to Dublin North for the election the following year, and was re-elected there in four further elections: June 1927, September 1927, 1932 and 1933.

Dublin North was abolished for the 1937 election, at which Mulcahy was defeated in the new constituency of Dublin North-East. However, he secured election to Seanad Éireann as a Senator, the upper house of the Oireachtas, representing the Administrative Panel. The 2nd Seanad sat for less than two months, and at the 1938 general election he was elected to the 10th Dáil as a TD for Dublin North-East. Defeated again in the election of 1943, he secured election to the 4th Seanad by the Labour Panel.

==Leader of Fine Gael==

After the resignation of W. T. Cosgrave as Leader of Fine Gael in 1944, Mulcahy became party leader while still a member of the Seanad. Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins was the parliamentary leader of the party in the Dáil at the time and Leader of the Opposition. Facing his first general election as party leader, Mulcahy drew up a list of 13 young candidates to contest seats for Fine Gael. Of the eight who ran, four were elected. He was returned to the 12th Dáil as a TD for Tipperary at the 1944 general election. While Fine Gael&#x27;s decline had been slowed, its future was still in doubt.

Following the 1948 general election—at which, following boundary changes, Mulcahy was elected for Tipperary South, the dominant Fianna Fáil party finished six seats short of a majority. However, it was 37 seats ahead of Fine Gael, and conventional wisdom suggested that Fianna Fáil was the only party that could form a government. Just as negotiations got underway, however, Mulcahy realised that if Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the National Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta and Clann na Talmhan banded together, they would have only one seat fewer than Fianna Fáil—and that if they could get support from seven independents, they would be able to form a government. He played a leading role in persuading the other parties to put aside their differences and join forces to consign the then Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader Éamon de Valera, to the opposition benches.

Since Fine Gael was by far the largest party in the prospective coalition, Mulcahy initially seemed set to become Taoiseach in a coalition government. However, he was not acceptable to Clann na Poblachta&#x27;s leader, Seán MacBride. Many Irish republicans had never forgiven Mulcahy for his role in the Civil War executions carried out under the Cosgrave government in the 1920s. Consequently, MacBride let it be known that he and his party would not serve under Mulcahy. Without Clann na Poblachta, the other parties would have had 57 seats between them—17 seats short of a majority in the 147-seat Dáil. Mulcahy stepped aside and encouraged his party colleague John A. Costello, a former Attorney General, to become the parliamentary leader of Fine Gael and the coalition&#x27;s candidate for Taoiseach. According to Mulcahy, the suggestion that another person serve as Taoiseach came from Labour leader William Norton. For the next decade, Costello served as the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader while Mulcahy remained the nominal leader of the party.

Mulcahy went on to serve as Minister for Education under Costello from 1948 until 1951. Another coalition government came to power at the 1954 election, with Mulcahy once again stepping aside to become Minister for Education in the Second Inter-Party Government. The government fell in 1957, but Mulcahy remained as Fine Gael leader until October 1959. In October of the following year, he told his Tipperary constituents that he did not intend to contest the next election.

==Family==

Richard Mulcahy married Min Ryan, the former fiancée of Seán Mac Diarmada, in 1920, and lived in a flat in Oakley House, Ranelagh. Min, a member of the Cumann na mBan Executive, had herself been involved in nationalist activity at the time of the Rising. One of his sons, Risteárd Mulcahy (1922–2016), was for many years a cardiologist in Dublin. His daughter Neillí Mulcahy (1925–2012) was one of Ireland&#x27;s leading fashion designers. She designed the uniforms for Aer Lingus in 1962. Another son was the structural engineer and visual artist Seán Mulcahy (1926–2018).

Richard Mulcahy died of cancer in Dublin on 16 December 1971, at the age of 85.

<doc id="251195" wikidata="Q176524" url="?curid=251195" title="John Bright">
<text>John Bright (16 November 1811 – 27 March 1889) was a British Radical and Liberal statesman, one of the greatest orators of his generation and a promoter of free trade policies.

A Quaker, Bright is most famous for battling the Corn Laws. In partnership with Richard Cobden, he founded the Anti-Corn Law League, aimed at abolishing the Corn Laws, which raised food prices and protected landowners&#x27; interests by levying taxes on imported wheat. The Corn Laws were repealed in 1846. Bright also worked with Cobden in another free trade initiative, the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty of 1860, promoting closer interdependence between Great Britain and the Second French Empire. This campaign was conducted in collaboration with French economist Michel Chevalier, and succeeded despite Parliament&#x27;s endemic mistrust of the French.

Bright sat in the House of Commons from 1843 to 1889, promoting free trade, electoral reform and religious freedom. He was almost a lone voice in opposing the Crimean War; he also opposed William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s proposed Home Rule for Ireland. He saw himself as a spokesman for the middle class and strongly opposed the privileges of the landed aristocracy. In terms of Ireland, he sought to end the political privileges of Anglicans, disestablished the Church of Ireland, and began land reform that would turn land over to the Catholic peasants. He coined the phrase &quot;The mother of parliaments.&quot;

==Early life==
Bright was born at Greenbank, Rochdale, in Lancashire, England—one of the early centres of the Industrial Revolution. His father, Jacob Bright, was a much respected Quaker, who had started a cotton mill at Rochdale in 1809. Jacob&#x27;s father, Abraham, was a Wiltshire yeoman, who, early in the 18th century, moved to Coventry, where his descendants remained. Jacob Bright was educated at the Ackworth School of the Society of Friends, and apprenticed to a fustian manufacturer at New Mills, Derbyshire. John Bright was his son by his second wife, Martha Wood, daughter of a Quaker shopkeeper of Bolton-le-Moors. Educated at Ackworth School, she was a woman of great strength of character and refined taste. There were eleven children of this marriage, of whom John was the eldest surviving son. His younger brother was Jacob Bright, an MP and mayor. His sisters included Priscilla Bright McLaren (whose husband was Duncan McLaren MP) and Margaret Bright Lucas. John was a delicate child and was sent as a day pupil to a boarding school near his home, kept by William Littlewood. A year at the Ackworth School, two years at Bootham School, York, and a year and a half at Newton, near Clitheroe, completed his education. He later claimed to have learned little Latin and Greek at school, but instead acquired a love of English literature, which his mother fostered, and a love of outdoor pursuits. In his sixteenth year, he entered his father&#x27;s mill, and in due time became a partner in the business.

In Rochdale, Jacob Bright was a leader of the opposition to a local church-rate. Rochdale was also prominent in the movement for parliamentary reform, by which the town successfully claimed to have a member allotted to it under the Reform Bill. John Bright took part in both campaigns. He was an ardent Nonconformist, proud to number among his ancestors John Gratton, a friend of George Fox, and one of the persecuted and imprisoned preachers of the Religious Society of Friends. His political interest was probably first kindled by the Preston election in 1830, in which Edward Stanley, after a long struggle, was defeated by Henry &quot;Orator&quot; Hunt.

But it was as a member of the Rochdale Juvenile Temperance Band that Bright first learned public speaking. These young men went out into the villages, borrowed a chair of a cottager, and spoke from it at open-air meetings. John Bright&#x27;s first extempore speech was at a temperance meeting. Bright got his notes muddled and broke down. The chairman gave out a temperance song, and during the singing told Bright to put his notes aside and say what came into his mind. Bright obeyed, began with much hesitancy, but found his tongue and made an excellent address, although sometimes he spoke with a confused syntax. Tales of these early years circulated through Britain and the United States late into his career, to the extent that students at institutions such as the young Cornell University regarded him as an exemplar for activities such as the Irving Literary Society.

On some early occasions, however, he committed his speech to memory. In 1832 he called on the Rev. John Aldis, an eminent Baptist minister, to accompany him to a local Bible meeting. Mr Aldis described him as a slender, modest young gentleman, who surprised him by his intelligence and thoughtfulness, but who seemed nervous as they walked to the meeting together. At the meeting he made a stimulating speech, and on the way home asked for advice. Mr Aldis counselled him not to learn his speeches, but to write out and commit to memory certain passages and the peroration. This &quot;first lesson in public speaking&quot;, as Bright called it, was given in his twenty-first year, but he had not then contemplated a public career. He was a fairly prosperous man of business, very happy in his home, always ready to take part in the social, educational and political life of his native town. A founder of the Rochdale Literary and Philosophical Society, he took a leading part in its debates, and on returning from a holiday journey in the east, gave the society a lecture on his travels.

==Cobden and the Corn Laws==
He first met Richard Cobden in 1836 or 1837. Cobden was an alderman of the newly formed Manchester Corporation, and Bright went to ask him to speak at an education meeting in Rochdale. Cobden consented, and at the meeting was much struck by Bright&#x27;s short speech and urged him to speak against the Corn Laws. His first speech on the Corn Laws was made at Rochdale in 1838, and in the same year he joined the Manchester provisional committee which in 1839 founded the Anti-Corn Law League. He was still only the local public man, taking part in all public movements, especially in opposition to John Fielden&#x27;s proposed factory legislation, and to the Rochdale church-rate. In 1839 he built the house which he called &quot;One Ash&quot;, and he married Elizabeth, daughter of the Quaker minister Rachel (born Bragg) and the tanner Jonathan Priestman of Newcastle upon Tyne.

In November of the same year there was a dinner in Bolton in honour of Abraham Paulton, who had just returned from an Anti-Corn Law tour in Scotland. Among the speakers were Cobden and Bright, and the dinner is memorable as the first occasion on which the two future leaders appeared together on a Free Trade platform. Bright is described by the historian of the League as &quot;a young man then appearing for the first time in any meeting out of his own town, and giving evidence, by his energy and by his grasp of the subject, of his capacity soon to take a leading part in the great agitation.&quot;
In 1840 he led a movement against the Rochdale church-rate, speaking from a tombstone in the churchyard, where it looks down on the town in the valley below. A daughter, Helen, was born to him; but his young wife, after a long illness, died of tuberculosis in September 1841. Three days after her death at Leamington, Cobden called to see him. &quot;I was in the depths of grief&quot;, said Bright, when unveiling the statue of his friend at Bradford in 1877, &quot;I might almost say of despair, for the life and sunshine of my house had been extinguished.&quot; Cobden spoke some words of condolence, but &quot;after a time he looked up and said, &#x27;There are thousands of homes in England at this moment where wives, mothers and children are dying of hunger. Now, when the first paroxysm of your grief is past, I would advise you to come with me, and we will never rest till the Corn Laws are repealed.&#x27; I accepted his invitation&quot;, added Bright, &quot;and from that time we never ceased to labour hard on behalf of the resolution which we had made.&quot;

==Into Parliament: the Member for Durham==

At the general election in 1841 Cobden was returned for Stockport, Cheshire, and in 1843 Bright was the Free Trade candidate at a by-election at Durham. He was defeated, but his successful competitor was unseated on petition, and at the second contest Bright was returned. He was already known as Cobden&#x27;s chief ally and was received in the House of Commons with suspicion and hostility. In the Anti-Corn Law movement, the two speakers complemented each other. Cobden had the calmness and confidence of the political philosopher; Bright had the passion and the fervour of the popular orator. Cobden did the reasoning, Bright supplied the declamation, but mingled argument with appeal. No orator of modern times rose more rapidly. He was not known beyond his own borough when Cobden called him to his side in 1841, and he entered parliament towards the end of the session of 1843 with a formidable reputation. He had been all over England and Scotland addressing vast meetings and, as a rule, carrying them with him; he had taken a leading part in a conference held by the Anti-Corn Law League in London had led deputations to the Duke of Sussex, to Sir James Graham, then home secretary, and to Lord Ripon and Gladstone, the secretary and undersecretary of the Board of Trade; and he was universally recognised as the chief orator of the Free Trade movement. Wherever &quot;John Bright of Rochdale&quot; was announced to speak, vast crowds assembled. He had been so announced, for the last time, at the first great meeting in Drury Lane Theatre on 15 March 1843; henceforth his name was enough. He took his seat in the House of Commons as one of the members for Durham on 28 July 1843, and on 7 August delivered his maiden speech in support of a motion by Mr Ewart for reduction of import duties. He was there, he said, &quot;not only as one of the representatives of the city of Durham, but also as one of the representatives of that benevolent organisation, the Anti-Corn Law League.&quot; A member who heard the speech described Bright as &quot;about the middle size, rather firmly and squarely built, with a fair, clear complexion and an intelligent and pleasing expression of countenance. His voice is good, his enunciation distinct, and his delivery free from any unpleasant peculiarity or mannerism.&quot; He wore the usual Friend&#x27;s coat and was regarded with much interest and hostile curiosity on both sides of the House.
Mr Ewart&#x27;s motion was defeated, but the movement of which Cobden and Bright were the leaders continued to spread. In the autumn the League resolved to raise £100,000; an appeal was made to the agricultural interest by great meetings in the farming counties, and in November &quot;The Times&quot; startled the country by declaring, in a leading article, &quot;The League is a great fact. It would be foolish, nay, rash, to deny its importance.&quot; In London great meetings were held in Covent Garden Theatre, at which William Johnson Fox was the chief orator, but Bright and Cobden were the leaders of the movement. Bright publicly deprecated the popular tendency to regard Cobden and himself as the chief movers in the agitation, and Cobden told a Rochdale audience that he always stipulated that he should speak first, and Bright should follow. His &quot;more stately genius&quot;, as John Morley calls it, was already making him the undisputed master of the feelings of his audiences. In the House of Commons his progress was slower. Cobden&#x27;s argumentative speeches were regarded more sympathetically than Bright&#x27;s more rhetorical appeals, and in a debate on George Villiers&#x27;s annual motion against the Corn Laws, Bright was heard with so much impatience that he was obliged to sit down.

In the next session (1845) he moved for an inquiry into the operation of the Game Laws. At a meeting of county members earlier in the day Robert Peel, then Prime Minister, had advised them not to be led into discussion by a violent speech from the member for Durham, but to let the committee be granted without debate. Bright was not violent, and Cobden said that he did his work admirably, and won golden opinions from all men. The speech established his position in the House of Commons. In this session Bright and Cobden came into opposition, Cobden voting for the Maynooth Grant and Bright against it. On only one other occasion—a vote for South Kensington—did they go into opposite lobbies, during twenty-five years of parliamentary life.

In the autumn of 1845 Bright retained Cobden in the public career to which Cobden had invited him four years before; Bright was in Scotland when a letter came from Cobden announcing his determination, forced on him by business difficulties, to retire from public work. Bright replied that if Cobden retired the mainspring of the League was gone. &quot;I can in no degree take your place&quot;, he wrote. &quot;As a second I can fight, but there are incapacities about me, of which I am fully conscious, which prevent my being more than second in such a work as we have laboured in.&quot; A few days later he set off for Manchester, posting in that wettest of autumns through &quot;the rain that rained away the Corn Laws&quot;, and on his arrival got his friends together, and raised the money which tided Cobden over the emergency. The crisis of the struggle had come. Peel&#x27;s budget in 1845 was a first step towards Free Trade. The bad harvest and the potato blight drove him to the repeal of the Corn Laws, and at a meeting in Manchester on 2 July 1846 Cobden moved and Bright seconded a motion dissolving the league. A library of twelve hundred volumes was presented to Bright as a memorial of the struggle.

==&quot;Flog a dead horse&quot;==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the first recorded use of the expression in its modern sense was by Bright in reference to the Reform Act 1867, which called for more democratic representation in Parliament. Trying to rouse Parliament from its apathy on the issue, he said in a speech, would be like trying to &quot;flog a dead horse&quot; to make it pull a load.

However, an earlier instance is attributed to Bright some thirteen years previously: speaking in the Commons on 28 March 1859 on a similar issue of parliamentary reform, Lord Elcho remarked that Bright had not been &quot;satisfied with the results of his winter campaign&quot; and that &quot;a saying was attributed to him [Bright] that he [had] found he was &#x27;flogging a dead horse.&#x27;&quot;

==&quot;England is the Mother of Parliaments&quot;==

Bright coined this famous phrase on 18 January 1865 in a speech at Birmingham supporting an expansion of the franchise. It has often been misquoted as a reference to the UK Parliament.

==Marriage and Manchester==
Bright married firstly, on 27 November 1839, Elizabeth Priestman of Newcastle, daughter of Jonathan Priestman and Rachel Bragg. They had one daughter, Helen Priestman Bright (b. 1840) but Elizabeth eventually died from tubercolosis on 10 September 1841. Bright had visited her often but she had been cared for by her sister Margaret. Elizabeth&#x27;s requests included that Helen Priestman Bright should be brought up by her larger family. She later married William Stephens Clark (1839–1925) of Street in Somerset.
Bright married secondly, in June 1847, Margaret Elizabeth Leatham, sister of Edward Aldam Leatham of Wakefield, by whom he had seven children including John Albert Bright and William Leatham Bright. Bright employed Lydia Rous in 1868 to teach his children. He compared her abilities as second only to the Queen.

In July 1847, Bright was elected uncontested for Manchester, with Milner Gibson. In the new parliament, he opposed legislation restricting the hours of labour, and, as a Nonconformist, spoke against clerical control of national education. In 1848 he voted for Hume&#x27;s household suffrage motion, and introduced a bill for the repeal of the Game Laws. When Lord John Russell brought forward his Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, Bright opposed it as &quot;a little, paltry, miserable measure&quot;, and foretold its failure. In this parliament he spoke much on Irish questions. In a speech in favour of the government bill for a rate in aid (a tax on the prosperous parts of Ireland that would have paid for famine relief in the rest of that island) in 1849, he won loud cheers from both sides, and was complimented by Disraeli for having sustained the reputation of that assembly. From this time forward he had the ear of the House, and took effective part in the debates. He spoke against capital punishment, against church-rates, against flogging in the army, and against the Irish Established Church. He supported Cobden&#x27;s motion for the reduction of public expenditure, and in and out of parliament pleaded for peace.

In the election of 1852 Bright was again returned for Manchester on the principles of free trade, electoral reform and religious freedom. But war was in the air, and the most impassioned speeches he ever delivered were addressed to this parliament in fruitless opposition to the Crimean War. Neither the House nor the country would listen. &quot;I went to the House on Monday&quot;, wrote Macaulay in March 1854, &quot;and heard Bright say everything I thought.&quot; His most memorable speech, the greatest he ever made, was delivered on 23 February 1855. &quot;The angel of death has been abroad throughout the land. You may almost hear the beating of his wings&quot;, he said, and concluded with an appeal that moved the House as it had never been moved within living memory.

In 1860, Bright won another victory with Cobden in a new Free Trade initiative, the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty, promoting closer interdependence between Britain and France. This campaign was conducted in collaboration with French economist Michel Chevalier, and succeeded despite Parliament&#x27;s endemic mistrust of the French.

==MP for Birmingham: 1858–89==

In 1857, Bright&#x27;s unpopular opposition to the Crimean War led to his losing his seat as member for Manchester. Within a few months, he was elected unopposed as one of the two MPs for Birmingham in 1858. He would hold this position for over thirty years though he would later leave the Liberal Party on the issue of Irish Home Rule in 1886.

On 27 October 1858, he launched his campaign for parliamentary reform at Birmingham Town Hall. In 1866 he wrote an essay with the title &quot;Speech on Reform&quot;. In this speech he demanded the enfranchisement of the working-class people because of their sheer number, and said that one should rejoice in open demonstrations rather than being confronted with &quot;armed rebellion or secret conspiracy&quot;. In 1868, Bright entered the cabinet of Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone as President of the Board of Trade, but resigned in 1870 due to ill health. He served twice again in Gladstone cabinets as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1873–74, 1880–82). In 1882, Gladstone ordered the Royal Navy to bombard Alexandria to recover the debts owed by the Egyptians to British investors. Bright scornfully dismissed it as &quot;a jobbers&#x27; war&quot; on behalf of a privileged class of capitalists, and resigned from the Gladstone cabinet.&quot;

For deeply personal reasons, Bright was closely associated with the North Wales tourist resort of Llandudno. In 1864, he holidayed there with his wife and five-year-old son. As they passed through the graveyard, the boy said, &quot;Mamma, when I am dead, I want to be buried here.&quot; A week later, he had died of scarlet fever, and his wish was granted. Bright returned to Llandudno at least once a year until his own death. He is still commemorated in Llandudno where the principal secondary school was named after him, and a new school, Ysgol John Bright was built in 2004.
Bright had much literary and social recognition in his later years. In 1880 he was elected Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow, although R. W. Dale wrote of his rectorial address: &quot;It was not the old Bright.&quot; He was given an honorary degree of the University of Oxford in 1886. He delivered the opening address for the Birmingham Central Library in 1882, and in 1888 the city erected a statue of him. The marble statue, by Albert Joy, was in store until it was recently restored to a prominent position in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Both John Bright Street, close to the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham, and Morse&#x27;s Creek in Australia, now known as Bright, Victoria, were renamed in his honour.

===Opposition to Home Rule===

When in the wake of the Great Irish Famine, an all-Ireland Tenant Right League was formed, Bright expressed sympathy and support for reform of Irish land tenure. In 1850 he advised the House of Common to &quot;resolutely legislate&quot; on the question. Key for Bright was that &quot;Instead of the [tenant-right] agitation being confined, as heretofore to the Roman Catholics and their clergy, Protestant and Dissenting clergymen seem to be amalgamated with Roman Catholics at present; indeed, there seems an amalgamation of all sects on this question.&quot; But once the sectarian division over Ireland&#x27;s future within the United Kingdom reasserted itself, Bright&#x27;s position hardened. Supporting Protestant Ulster, he would have no truck with what he described as the &quot;disloyal Ireland&quot;.

In 1886 when Gladstone proposed Home Rule for Ireland and another Irish Land Act, Bright opposed it, along with Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Hartington. He regarded Charles Stewart Parnell&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party as &quot;the rebel party&quot;. Bright was repeatedly contacted by Gladstone, Chamberlain and Hartington to solicit his support. He was widely regarded as a force to be reckoned with and his political influence was considerably out of proportion to his activity. In March 1886 Bright went to London, and on 10 March met Hartington, having an hour&#x27;s talk with him on Ireland. On 12 March Bright met Gladstone for dinner, writing that Gladstone&#x27;s &quot;chief object is to settle the Land question which I rather think ought &quot;now&quot; ought be considered as settled. On the question of a Parliament in Dublin, he wishes to get rid of Irish representation at Westminster, in which I entirely agree with him if it be possible&quot;. On 17 March he met Chamberlain and thought &quot;his view is in the main correct and that it is not wise in him to support the intended measures&quot;. On 20 March he had a two-hour-long meeting with Gladstone:

He gave me a long memorandum, historical in character, on the past Irish story, which seemed to be somewhat one-sided, leaving out of view the important minority and the views and feelings of the Protestant and loyal portion of the people. He explained much of his policy as to a Dublin Parliament, and as to Land purchase. I objected to the Land policy as unnecessary—the Act of 1881 had done all that was reasonable for the tenants—why adopt the policy of the rebel party, and get rid of landholders, and thus evict the English garrison as the rebels call them? I denied the value of the security for repayment. Mr G. argued that his finance arrangements would be better than present system of purchase, and that we were bound in honour to succour the landlords, which I contested. Why not go to the help of other interests in Belfast and Dublin? As to Dublin Parliament, I argued that he was making a surrender all along the line—a Dublin Parliament would work with constant friction, and would press against any barrier he might create to keep up the unity of the three Kingdoms. What of a volunteer force, and what of import duties and protection as against British goods? ... I thought he placed far too much confidence in the leaders of the rebel party. I could place none in them, and the general feeling was and is that any terms made with them would not be kept, and that through them I could not hope for reconciliation with discontented and disloyal Ireland.
On 8 April Gladstone introduced the Home Rule Bill into the House of Commons, where it passed the first reading without division. Bright did not enter the debates on the Bill and left London at the end of April to attend the funeral of his brother-in-law. He then returned to his home in Rochdale. On 13 May Gladstone sent him a letter, requesting he visit him in London. This date was also the anniversary of the death of Bright&#x27;s wife&#x27;s, so he replied that he felt the need to spend it at home. He further wrote:

I cannot consent to a measure which is so offensive to the whole Protestant population of Ireland, and to the whole sentiment of the province of Ulster so far as its loyal and Protestant people are concerned. I cannot agree to exclude them from the protection of the Imperial Parliament. I would do much to clear the rebel party from Westminster, and do not sympathise with those who wish to retain them—but admit there is much force in the arguments on this point which are opposed to my views upon it. ... As to the Land Bill, if it comes to a second reading, I fear I must vote against it. It may be that my hostility to the rebel party, looking at their conduct since your Government was formed six years ago, disables me from taking an impartial view of this great question. If I could believe them honorable and truthful men, I could yield much—but I suspect that your policy of surrender to them will only place more power in their hands to war with greater effect against the unity of the 3 Kingdoms with no increase of good to the Irish people. ... Parliament is not ready for it, and the intelligence of the country is not ready for it. If it be possible, I should wish that no Division should be taken upon the Bill.

On 14 May Bright came to London and wrote to the Liberal MP Samuel Whitbread that Gladstone should withdraw the Home Rule Bill and that he should not dissolve Parliament if the Bill were put forward for a second reading and were defeated in a vote: &quot;... it would only make the Liberal split the more serious, and make it beyond the power of healing. He would be responsible for the greatest wound the Party has received since it was a Party ... If the Bill were now withdrawn, the whole present difficulty in our Party would be gone&quot;. He also predicted the Conservatives would gain in strength if an election were called.

At the famous meeting at the Committee Room 15, Liberal MPs who were not outright opponents of the idea of Irish self-government but who disapproved of the Bill, met to decide upon a course of action. Among the attendees were Chamberlain, and Bright wrote to on 31 May:

My present intention is to vote against the Second Reading, not having spoken in the debate. I am not willing to have my view of the bill or Bills in doubt. But I am not willing to take the responsibility of advising others as to their course. If they can content themselves with abstaining from the division, I shall be glad. they will render a greater service by preventing the threatened dissolution than by compelling it ... a small majority for the Bill may be almost as good as its defeat and may save the country from the heavy sacrifice of a general election. I wish I could join you, but I cannot now change the path I have taken from the beginning of this unhappy discussion ...&quot;P.S.&quot;—If you think it of any use you may read this note to your friends.

Chamberlain read aloud this letter to the meeting and he later wrote that Bright&#x27;s &quot;announcement that he intended to vote against the Second Reading undoubtedly affected the decision&quot; and that the meeting ended by unanimously agreeing to vote against the Bill. Bright wrote to Chamberlain on 1 June that he was surprised at the meeting&#x27;s decision because his letter &quot;was intended to make it more easy for and your friends to abstain from voting in the coming division&quot;. On 7 June the Home Rule Bill was defeated by 341 votes to 311, Bright voting against it. Gladstone dissolved Parliament.

During the subsequent general election campaign, Bright delivered only one speech, to his constituents on 1 July, in which he opposed Irish Home Rule. He exhorted his countrymen to put the Union above the Liberal Party. This speech was generally viewed by the Gladstonian Liberals as having a decisive effect on their defeat. John Morley wrote that &quot;The heaviest and most telling attack came from Mr. Bright, who had up to now in public been studiously silent. Every word, as they said of Daniel Webster, seemed to weigh a pound. His arguments were mainly those of his letter already given, but they were delivered with a gravity and force that told powerfully upon the large phalanx of doubters all over the kingdom&quot;. The chairman of the National Liberal Federation, Sir B. Walter Foster, complained that Bright &quot;probably did more harm in this election to his own party than any other single individual&quot;. The Liberal journalist P. W. Clayden was a candidate for Islington North and when canvassing leading dissident Liberals, he would take with him a copy of the Home Rule Bill:

Going through the Bill with some of them clause by clause, I was able to answer all their objections, and in many cases to get their promise of support. Mr Bright&#x27;s speech, however, at once undid all my work. In the whole country it probably kept many thousands of Liberal voters from going to the polls, and did more than all the other influences put together to produce the Liberal abstention which gave the Coalition its decisive victory.

Bright was re-elected by his Birmingham constituents and it turned out to be his last Parliament. He sat as a Liberal Unionist allied to the Conservative Party who had formed a government after the election. Bright participated little in this Parliament, however his actions could still decide events. Lord George Hamilton recorded that when the government introduced the Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland) Bill in March 1887, which increased the authorities&#x27; coercive powers, the Liberal Party opposed it. Bright did not speak in the debate but Hamilton notes that great importance was attached to how Bright would vote: &quot;If he abstained from voting or voted against the Government, the Unionist coalition would have been practically broken up. On the other hand if he, in order to avert Home Rule, voted for a procedure which was so contrary to his previous professions, the Coalition would receive a fresh source of strength and cohesion. When the Division Bell rang, Mr. Bright, who was sitting close by Gladstone, without a moment&#x27;s hesitation walked straight into the Government&#x27;s lobby&quot;.

From this point until his death, Bright did not meet Gladstone, despite their long political relationship together.

==MLA for Kennedy, Queensland: 1869–70==
The Colony of Queensland achieved separation from New South Wales in 1859 with Brisbane in the south-east corner chosen as its capital. By the 1860s, the perceived dominance of southern Queensland created a strong separatist movement in Central Queensland and North Queensland, seeking to establish yet another independent colony. In the 1867 Queensland colonial election, some separatists decided to nominate John Bright as the candidate for the electoral district of Rockhampton in Central Queensland, arguing that representation in the Queensland Parliament had been ineffective, so they would seek a representative within the British Parliament. However, he polled only 10 votes and was not elected.

Subsequently, on 11 June 1869, Thomas Henry Fitzgerald, member for the electoral district of Kennedy in North Queensland, resigned, triggering a by-election. John Bright was again nominated as part of the separatist protest and on this occasion won the resulting by-election on 10 July 1869. When nominating him, one separatist declared:

Let us elect a man of some weight at home, who will take our case before the Queen and try for redress. There is no man more eminently qualified for this purpose than the Honourable John Bright—a favourite with the Queen, a favourite with the nation—the representative of trade, commerce, and manufactures in the Government and the champion of liberty, and yet a loyal subject. If we can enlist his sympathies, we are right. I believe he is the man who will break the iron rod of the South and set us free; for he has already fought for the liberty of the subject, and I cannot believe he will turn a deaf ear to our manifold sorrows.

In January 1870, the separatists sent a petition to Queen Victoria requesting that North Queensland be made a separate colony to be called &quot;Albertsland&quot; (after the Queen&#x27;s late husband Albert, Prince Consort). As Bright never visited Queensland or took his seat in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, his failure to attend parliament eventually resulted in his seat being declared vacant on 8 July 1870. North Queensland did not achieve separation and remained part of the Colony of Queensland (now the State of Queensland).

It is not known what role John Bright had in these Queensland political activities, or indeed if he was even aware of them. However, it was claimed in 1867 that Bright was an &quot;intimate personal friend&quot; of the then Governor of Queensland George Bowen.

==Death==

In late 1888, Bright became seriously ill and he realised the end was near. On 27 November his son Albert wrote a letter to Gladstone in which he said his father &quot;wishes me to write to you and tell you that &quot;he could not forget your unvarying kindness to him and the many services you have rendered the country&quot;. He was very weak and did not seem able to say any more, and I saw the tears running down his cheeks&quot;. Gladstone replied that &quot;I can assure you that he has been little absent of late from mine, that my feelings towards him are entirely unaltered by any of the occurrences of the last three years and that I have never felt separated from him in spirit. I heartily pray that he may enjoy the peace of God on this side the grave and on the other&quot;.

Bright received many letters and telegrams of sympathy from the Queen downwards. The Irish Nationalist MP Tim Healy wrote to Bright, wishing him a speedy recovery and &quot;Your great services to our people can never be forgotten, for it was when Ireland had fewest friends that your voice was loudest on her side. I hope you may still be spared to raise it on her behalf according to your conceptions of what is best, for while we go on struggling for our own views, there can be nothing but regrets on our part of the sharpness of division in the past&quot;.

Bright died at his home One Ash on 27 March 1889 and was buried in the graveyard of the meeting-house of the Religious Society of Friends in Rochdale.

The Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury paid tribute to him in the House of Lords the day after his death, and it sums up his character as a public man:

In the first place, he was the greatest master of English oratory that this generation has produced, or I may perhaps say several generations back. I have met men who have heard Pitt and Fox, and in whose judgment their eloquence at its best was inferior to the finest efforts of John Bright. At a time when much speaking has depressed and almost exterminated eloquence, he maintained robust and intact that powerful and vigorous style of English which gave fitting expression to the burning and noble thoughts he desired to express. Another characteristic for which I think he will be famous is the singular rectitude of his motives, the singular straightness of his career. He was a keen disputant, a keen combatant; like many eager men, he had little tolerance of opposition. But his action was never guided for a single moment by any consideration of personal or party selfishness. He was inspired by nothing but the purest patriotism and benevolence from the first beginning of his public career to the hour of its close.

==Memorials==
In 1868, students of the new Cornell University debated whether to call its first literary society, &quot;The John Bright Brotherhood&quot; or the &quot;Irving Literary Society&quot;. New York State&#x27;s recently deceased native son received the honours, but not before Bright was inducted as its first honorary member.

The library at Bootham School is named in his honour.

In 1928, the Brooks-Bryce Foundation donated significant funds to the Princeton University Library for a collection of materials on the life and times of John Bright, in honour of the statesman. The Foundation also donated funds for an outdoor pulpit to be added to Princeton Chapel, also in honour of Bright.

His name is given to John Bright Street in Birmingham, his statue is in the collection of Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery and to the secondary school Ysgol John Bright in Llandudno, North Wales.

The town of Bright in Victoria, Australia, is named in his honour.

==Legacy==
Historian A. J. P. Taylor summarized Bright&#x27;s achievements:
John Bright was the greatest of all parliamentary orators. He had many political successes. Along with Richard Cobden, he conducted the campaign which led to the repeal of the Corn Laws. He did more than any other man to prevent the intervention of this country (Britain) on the side of the South during the American Civil War, and he headed the reform agitation in 1867 which brought the industrial working class within the pale of the constitution. It was Bright who made possible the Liberal party of Gladstone, Asquith and Lloyd George, and the alliance between middle class idealism and trade unionism, which he promoted, still lives in the present-day Labour Party.

<doc id="251196" wikidata="Q7858590" url="?curid=251196" title="Twistor memory">
<text>Twistor memory is a form of computer memory formed by wrapping magnetic tape around a current-carrying wire. Operationally, twistor was very similar to core memory. Twistor could also be used to make ROM memories, including a re-programmable form known as piggyback twistor. Both forms were able to be manufactured using automated processes, which was expected to lead to much lower production costs than core-based systems.

Introduced by Bell Labs in 1957, the first commercial use was in their 1ESS switch which went into operation in 1965. Twistor was used only briefly in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when semiconductor memory devices replaced almost all earlier memory systems. The basic ideas behind twistor also led to the development of bubble memory, although this had a similarly short commercial lifespan.

==Core memory==
===Construction===

In core memory, small ring-shaped magnets - the cores - are threaded by two crossed wires, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, to make a matrix known as a &quot;plane&quot;. When one X and one Y wire are powered, a magnetic field is generated at a 45-degree angle to the wires. The core magnets sit on the wires at a 45-degree angle, so the single core wrapped around the crossing point of the powered X and Y wires will be affected by the induced field.

The materials used for the core magnets were specially chosen to have a very &quot;square&quot; magnetic hysteresis pattern. This meant that fields just below a certain threshold will do nothing, but those just above this threshold will cause the core to be affected by that magnetic field; it will abruptly flip its magnetization state. The square pattern and sharp flipping states ensures that a single core can be addressed within a grid; nearby cores will see a slightly different field, and not be affected.

===Data retrieval===
The basic operation in a core memory is writing. This is accomplished by powering a selected X and Y wire both to the current level that will, by itself, create ½ the critical magnetic field. This will cause the field at the crossing point to be greater than the core&#x27;s saturation point, and the core will pick up the external field. Ones and zeros are represented by the direction of the field, which can be set simply by changing the direction of the current flow in one of the two wires.

In core memory, a third wire - the &quot;sense/inhibit line&quot; - is needed to write or read a bit. Reading uses the process of writing; the X and Y lines are powered in the same fashion that they would be to write a &quot;0&quot; to the selected core. If that core held a &quot;1&quot; at that time, then the magnetic state flips to a &quot;0&quot; and the transition causes a short pulse of electricity to be induced into the sense/inhibit line. If no pulse is seen, then no flip occurred, thus the core already held a &quot;0&quot;. This process is destructive; if the core did hold a &quot;1&quot;, that pattern is destroyed during the read, and has to be re-set in a subsequent operation.

The sense/inhibit line is shared by all of the cores in a particular plane, meaning that only one bit can be read (or written) at once. Core planes were typically stacked in order to store one bit of a word per plane, and a word could be read or written in a single operation by working all of the planes at once.

Between reads or writes the data was stored magnetically. This means that core is a non-volatile memory.

===Manufacturing===
Manufacturing core was a major issue. The X and Y wires had to be threaded through the cores in a weave pattern, and the sense/inhibit line passed through every core in a plane. In spite of considerable effort, no one successfully automated the production of core, which remained a manual task into the 1970s. To increase memory density one had to use smaller cores, which greatly increased the difficulty of wiring them onto the lines.

==Twistor==
An early iteration of the Twistor comprised a twisted ferromagnetic wire threaded through a series of concentric solenoids. The longer solenoid is the SENSE coil, the shorter one the WRITE coil. A single bit was written by pulsing the WRITE coil with a + (1) or - (0) current sufficient to magnetize the helical area beneath the coil in one of two directions. At one end of the stretched wire was the READ solenoid - when pulsed it sent an acoustic wave through the wire. As the acoustic pulse passed under each SENSE coil it induced a small electrical pulse, either + or - depending on the direction of magnetization of the region of the wire. Thus with each pulse a &quot;byte&quot; could be read out serially. 

Twistor was similar in concept to core memory, but replaced the circular magnets with magnetic tape to store the patterns. The tape was wrapped around one set of the wires, the equivalent of the X line, in such a way that it formed a 45-degree helix. The Y wires were replaced by solenoids wrapping a number of twistor wires. Selection of a particular bit was the same as in core, with one X and Y line being powered, generating a field at 45 degrees. The magnetic tape was specifically selected to only allow magnetization along the length of the tape, so only a single point of the twistor would have the right direction of field to become magnetized.

The original twistor system used permalloy tape wrapped around a 3 mil copper wire. For any given length of wire, the tape was wound up over only the first half. The copper wire was then bent at the point where the tape ended, and ran back alongside the portion with the tape, forming a return conductor. This meant all the connections were at one end. Several such twistor lines were laid side-by-side and then laminated into a PET film plastic sheet, with the twistors and their return wires about 1/10th of an inch apart. A typical tape might have five twistor wires and their returns, so the sheet was just over an inch wide. The solenoid was similarly constructed, consisting of a number of 0.15 inch wide copper tapes laminated into a plastic tape of the same basic dimensions as the twistor. Unlike a traditional solenoid with many turns of wire around an open core, this system was essentially nothing more than single wires in a sheet of plastic.

To build the complete memory system, a sheet of the solenoid was laid out flat, say along the X direction, and then a sheet of the twistor was laid on top at right angles to it along the Y axis. The solenoid tape was then folded over, so that it wrapped the twistor sheet, producing a series of U-shaped solenoids. Now another layer of the solenoid tape is laid over the first, the twistor tape folded over so it now runs along the negative Y axis across the top of the new solenoid tape, and then the solenoid tape is folded over to form a second set of loops. This process continues until the twistor strip is &quot;used up&quot;, forming a compact cube of memory. Along one side of the memory, connected to each of the solenoid loops, was a series of small cores used solely for switching (their original purpose, development as a memory came later).

The main reason for Bell&#x27;s development of twistor is that the process could be highly automated. Although the folding process that completed the twistor might be carried out by hand, the layup and laminating of the sheets was easily handled by machine. Improved versions of twistor also wrapped the section of bare copper initially used solely for the return path, thereby doubling density without any changes to the production techniques.

===Operation===
Writing to twistor was effectively identical to core; a particular bit was selected by powering one of the twistor wires and one of the solenoid loops to one half of the required power, such that the required field strength was created only at the intersection of the two.

Reading used a different process. Unlike core, twistor did not have a sense/inhibit line. Instead, it used a larger current in the solenoid, large enough to flip all of the bits in that loop, and then used the twistor wires as the read line.

Twistor was thus read and written one plane at a time, rather than in core, where only one bit per plane could be used at once.

===Permanent magnet twistor===
Twistor could be modified to produce a ROM that could be easily re-programmed. To do this, one-half of each solenoid loop was replaced with an aluminum card into which tiny vicalloy bar magnets were embedded. As the solenoids have to be complete circuits in order for current to flow through them, they were still inserted as folded sheets, but in this case the loop was inserted &quot;between&quot; the folds of twistor instead of around them. This allowed the single sheet to act as one half of a solenoid loop for two folds of the twistor, above and below. To complete the loop, the card of magnets was placed on the other side of the twistor tape.

Reads were performed by powering the solenoid to a point about half of that needed to produce a write. This field was &quot;reflected&quot; by the aluminum sheet, closing the loop, magnetically. The resulting field was greater than the write strength, causing the permalloy state to flip. If the bit was beside an unmagnetized bar magnet in the card, the field was not opposed and the flip caused a current pulse in the twistor wire, reading a &quot;1&quot;. However, by magnetizing the bar at that bit, the bar magnet opposed the field being created by the solenoid current, causing it to be below the write strength, and preventing the flip. This read a &quot;0&quot;.

The permanent magnet twistor (PMT) was re-programmed by removing the plates and placing them over a custom writer. Vicalloy was used because it required much more power to re-magnetize than the permalloy tape, so that the system would never come close to re-setting the permanent magnets while in use in the memory system. The writer system used much larger currents that overcame this resistance.

The PMT that was used in the 1ESS system used modules with 128 cards with 2818 magnets (for 64 44-bit words) on each. This produced a module with 8192 words (8 kibiwords). The complete store used 16 modules for a total of 131,072 words (128 kibiwords), equivalent to 720,896 8-bit bytes (704 KiB).

===Piggyback twistor===
Another form of twistor ROM replaced the permanent magnet cards with a second magnetic tape wrapped around the first on the twistor lines, in a &quot;piggyback&quot; configuration. This tape was coated with coballoy instead of permalloy, which is much &quot;harder&quot; magnetically, requiring about twice the field in order to flip. To make the system even harder, the coballoy tape was about two and a half times thicker than the permalloy one, so the resulting field strength was five times. The external current required to flip the state of the coballoy tape was about 15 times that of the normal operational current.

Read operations in the piggyback are identical to the permanent magnet version. Writes were slightly more complex, due to the fact that piggyback twistors all featured the magnetic tape along the entire length of the X wire. This meant that any one solenoid was wrapping both the bit that is being written as well as the one on the section of return wire. To set the one both and not the other, the solenoid was first powered in one direction and then the other, while the current in the twistor line remained constant. This created two magnetic fields in turn, one aligned with the first section of wire and then the second. All reads and writes were carried out on paired bits in this fashion.

==Applications==
Twistor was used in a number of applications. Much of the development funding was supplied by the US Air Force, as twistor was to be used as the main memory in the LIM-49 Nike Zeus project.

In the United States the Bell System (American Telephone &amp; Telegraph) also used twistors with permanent magnets as the &quot;Program Store&quot; or main memory in their first electronic telephone switching system, the 1ESS as well as others in the ESS series of electronic telephone switches, and did so up to the 4ESS switch introduced in 1976 and sold into the 1980s.

In addition, twistor was used in the Traffic Service Position System (TSPS), Bell&#x27;s successor to cord telephone switchboards which controlled call handling and coin collection for local and international calls.

By 2017 all remaining TSPS and ESS installations used to provide telephone service in rural areas of the United States had been removed. Some systems may remain in use Mexico and Colombia, where many U.S. systems were sold and re-installed after being removed from service in the United States.

<text>Pláka () is the old historical neighborhood of Athens, clustered around the northern and eastern slopes of the Acropolis, and incorporating labyrinthine streets and neoclassical architecture. Plaka is built on top of the residential areas of the ancient town of Athens. It is known as the &quot;Neighborhood of the Gods&quot; due to its proximity to the Acropolis and its many archaeological sites.

== Name ==

The toponym &quot;Plaka&quot; is first attested in the second half of the 17th century. Up until the era of Otto, it pertained only to the area around the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (locals knew it as &quot;&quot;Kandili&quot; &#x27;lantern&#x27; of Demosthenes&quot; at least since 1460, or just as &quot;kandili&quot;); it was only after 1834 that the toponym&#x27;s application gradually expanded to eventually include the entire area between today&#x27;s Makrygianni Street and the Ancient Agora. Prior of that, the local Athenians referred to the area by various other names, such as &quot;Alikokkou&quot;, &quot;Kontito&quot;, &quot;Kandili&quot;, or by the names of the local churches. In particular, Alikokkou was the name of the broader area of what is now Plaka, until the early 20th century, and was one of the divisions into which Athens was divided during the Ottoman era; the toponym Alikokkou derived from the surname of a family who was likely of Frankish origin, but had been Hellenized. 

Some have suggested that the toponym Plaka derives from the Arvanitika &quot;Pliak Athena&quot;, meaning &#x27;Old Athens&#x27;; from Albanian &quot;plak&quot; &#x27;old&#x27;. Others have suggested that it derives from the presence of a plaque (Greek: πλάκα; romanized: &quot;plaka&quot;) which once marked its central intersection. The latter view is also supported by linguist Charalampos Symeonides (2010), who stated that &quot;Plaka&quot; is a common Medieval and Modern Greek toponym that can be found throughout Greece, and is attested as early as 1089; in the case of Athens, it denoted a place with ancient plaques or marbles.

==Location==
Plaka is on the northeast slope of Acropolis, between Syntagma and Monastiraki square. Adrianou Street (running north and south) is the largest and most central street in Plaka and divides it into two areas: the upper level, - Ano Plaka - located right under the Acropolis and the lower level - Kato Plaka - situated between Syntagma and Monastiraki.

==History==
The extent of the area called &quot;Plaka&quot; has evolved over time. Plaka was developed mostly around the ruins of Ancient Agora of Athens. It is the oldest district of Athens and has been continuously inhabited from the neolithic to the present day. As a result, Plaka contains monuments from all periods of the city&#x27;s history. Some of the streets, such as Adrianou and Tripodon, can be traced back to the ancient era. The population of Athens grew during the early 16th century, and the town experienced another urban development after the one which occurred in 1456, this time towards the north-east, again mainly by the settlement of Albanians who had moved in the region several years before the Ottoman arrival. After the Ottoman conquest, these settlements occurred in Attica in one wave after the Venetian loss of its Morean strongholds in 1540, and in another wave after a revolt in the Morea in 1570, when the Ottoman administration decreed the mandatory settlement of Albanians in Attica, in order to offer them improving living conditions. The such created parts of the north-eastern district of Athens later became known as &quot;Plaka&quot;. During that period, Plaka was also the home of the Greek aristocratic Benizelos family, the family that Saint Philothei came from. In the mid-17th century, out of the eight main administrative units () in Athens, it appears Plaka was the least densely inhabited.

During the Greek War of Independence, Plaka like the rest of Athens, was temporarily abandoned by its inhabitants because of the severe battles that took place in 1826. The area was repopulated during the first years of the reign of Otto of Greece. Plaka became inhabited by a mixed population, that included old Athenian families, as well as an influx of newcomers, such as artisans, professionals, military personnel, and others. It had a sizable Albanian community till the late 19th century, and as a result, it was the Albanian quarter of Athens. They had their own courts where they used the Albanian language. Their descendants nowadays have been assimilated into the Greek nation in considerable numbers. This happened through Greek control over the education system. During the period of Otto&#x27;s reign, the neighborhood of Anafiotika, featuring traditional Cycladic architecture, was built by settlers from the Aegean island of Anafi.

Plaka assumed its present form during the 19th and early decades of the 20th century. Following Greek independence, the area grew rapidly. In 1884, a fire burned down a large part of the neighborhood which gave the opportunity for the archaeologists to conduct excavations in the Roman Market and Hadrian&#x27;s library. Excavations have been taking place continuously since the 19th century. Growth continued until World War II. From the 1950s until the 1970s, Plaka experienced some degradation, as a result of the post-war construction boom, the increase in motor cars, and the tourist boom. In the 1980s, a comprehensive preservation plan was implemented, and the area improved rapidly. Nowadays Plaka is a major tourist destination.

==Modern neighbourhood==
Plaka is visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists around the year, and is under strict zoning and conservation regulations, as the only neighborhood in Athens where all utilities (water, power, cable television, telephone, internet, and sewage) lie underground in fully accessible, custom-made tunneling.

Museums in Plaka include:

*Acropolis Museum
*Athens University Museum
*Frissiras Museum
*Jewish Museum of Greece
*Museum of Greek Folk Art, an annex of which is the Old Public Baths building
*Museum of Greek Folk Musical Instruments
*Museum of Pavlos and Alexandra Kanellopoulou

==Cinema==
Many movies of the Greek cinema were filmed in the area. Some of them include:
*&quot;And the Wife Shall Revere Her Husband&quot;
*&quot;The Drunkard (film)&quot;
*&quot;What If...&quot;, Christoforos Papakaliatis movie
*&quot;Woe to the Young&quot;

<text>Stony Brook University (SBU), officially the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is a public research university in Stony Brook, New York, United States, on Long Island. Along with the University at Buffalo, it is one of the State University of New York system&#x27;s two flagship institutions. Its campus consists of 213 buildings on over of land in Suffolk County and it is the largest public university (by area) in the state of New York.

Opened in 1957 in Oyster Bay as the State University College on Long Island, the institution moved to Stony Brook in 1962. Stony Brook is part of the Association of American Universities and the Universities Research Association. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Stony Brook University, in partnership with Battelle, manages Brookhaven National Laboratory, a national laboratory of the United States Department of Energy. The university acquired land for a Research &amp; Development Park adjacent to its main campus in 2004, and has four business incubators across the region. Stony Brook is the largest single-site employer on Long Island; over 25,500 students are enrolled at the university, which has over 15,000 employees and over 2,850 faculty.

Stony Brook is a member of the Coastal Athletic Association, and its intercollegiate athletic teams have competed at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) since 1999.

== History ==

===Origins in Oyster Bay===
The State University of New York at Stony Brook was established in Oyster Bay in 1957, as the State University College on Long Island (SUCOLI). Established almost a decade after the creation of New York&#x27;s public higher education system, the institution was envisioned as a college for the preparation of secondary school teachers.

Leonard K. Olson was appointed as the first dean of the institution and was instrumental in the recruitment of faculty staff and planning of the later Stony Brook campus. SUCOLI opened with an inaugural class of 148 students, on the grounds of the William Robertson Coe Planting Fields estate. These first students were admitted on a tuition-free basis.

1961 was a year of firsts as 30 students were conferred degrees in the first commencement and the university was appointed its first president, John Francis Lee. Lee left later that year due to political and bureaucratic matters regarding the future of the university and the central administration at Albany. Nevertheless, he had fulfilled his primary task of reshaping the university from a technical science and engineering college of limited degree options to a full-scale university featuring liberal arts programs.

===Move to Stony Brook===
In 1960 the Heald Report, commissioned by Governor Nelson Rockefeller, recommended a major new public university be built on Long Island to &quot;stand with the finest in the country,&quot; a report that would ultimately shape most of the university&#x27;s growth for years to come.
Ward Melville, a philanthropist and businessman from the Three Village area in western Suffolk County donated over of land to the state for the development of a state university and in 1962 the institution relocated to Stony Brook and officially renamed as the State University of New York at Stony Brook. However, the longer name has fallen out of favor; since 2005, it has usually been called simply Stony Brook University (SBU).

The campus had 782 students enrolled in 1962, but enrollment had increased more than tenfold by 1969, surpassing the 8,000 mark, fueled by the large funding of public higher education in the Sputnik era. In 1963, only three years after the release of the Heald Report, the Governor commissioned the &quot;Education of Health Professions&quot; (Muir Report) report. The report outlined the need for expansion of the university system to prepare medical professionals for the future needs of the state. The report was particularly important for Stony Brook as it recommended creation of a Health Sciences Center and academic hospital at the campus to serve the need of the fastest-growing counties (Nassau and Suffolk) in New York at the time.

===Growth===

In 1965, the State University appointed John S. Toll, a physicist from the University of Maryland as the second president of Stony Brook. In 1966, the university set forth initial timetables for the development of the Health Sciences Center, which would house the university&#x27;s health programs and hospital. Despite the budgetary concerns and challenges from Albany, the university released a formalized plan early in 1968 and funding for recruitment of faculty was provided. At the same time, residential housing was expanded to 3,000, the Stony Brook Union opened in 1970, and in 1971, the massive expansion project for the campus library (named in memory of Frank Melville Jr., father of philanthropist Ward Melville) was completed.

Despite the fast-paced growth, campus infrastructure often struggled to keep pace: overcrowding, expansion, landscaping, lighting, and safety were persistent problems at the university, which led to multiple protests and growing tension between the student body and the administration. In January 1968, the infamous &quot;Operation Stony Brook&quot; drug raid resulted in the arrest of 29 students, and in the fall of 1968, tension climaxed as the administration and students decided on a three-day moratorium to bring together the entire university with the goal of improving communication between the students, faculty, and administration.
The 1970s witnessed the growth of the university and its transformation as a major research institution within New York&#x27;s public school system, with strong graduate programs and scientific breakthroughs like the development of magnetic resonance imaging. But the university lagged significantly in undergraduate education, prioritizing graduate education and research over undergraduate studies and student life. By 1975, enrollment had reached 16,000 and expansion crossed over Nicolls Road with the construction of the Health Sciences Center, which would be completed in 1980.

In 1981, John Marburger was inaugurated as the third president, and continued the expansion. By the late 1980s, the administration affirmed the need to improve other areas of the institution, which included undergraduate education, student and residential life, and intercollegiate athletics. In 1994, the university approved a decision to transition athletics to the Division I of the NCAA by 1999 and followed with the construction of the Stony Brook Arena and the expansion of the Indoor Sports Complex.

===Further expansion into the 21st century===
The 1990s affirmed Stony Brook&#x27;s success at building a research university with a strong undergraduate education. Under the leadership of its fourth president, Shirley Strum Kenny, the administration sought out to showcase the value of the institution. Kenny was responsible for campus wide improvement projects, which included large-scale landscaping, renovations of every residence hall, the continued growth of the athletics programs, the improvement of student life, ever-increasing research expenditures, a branding/marketing campaign, and the university&#x27;s increasing ties with private philanthropy.

In the mid-1990s, the school began to distance itself from the SUNY system, as Kenny believed that the SUNY name was hurting the school&#x27;s reputation.

In 1998, the university became one of the top 100 American research universities in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. That same year, the university and Battelle Memorial Institute were chosen by the Department of Energy as joint operators of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, joining a selective group of universities that operate national laboratories across the nation. Enrollment reached the 20,000 mark in 2001, and the administration&#x27;s improvement efforts climaxed with the invitation to the highly selective Association of American Universities, an organization of North American universities committed to a strong system of research and education.

2002 saw the opening of the $22 million Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium and the inauguration of the massive Charles B. Wang Center dedicated to Asian and American culture, funded by a $50 million donation from Charles B. Wang. At the time, it was the largest private donation to a SUNY institution. In 2003, chemistry professor Paul Lauterbur received a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research and discovery of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, which was instrumental in the development of NMR Imaging (MRI) while at Stony Brook. In 2005, the university bought the Flowerfield property adjacent to campus through eminent domain as land for the development of a Research and Development Park. Plans for a law school were in the talks but scrapped shortly after.

In 2009, president Shirley Strum Kenny stepped down, and in May, Samuel L. Stanley was announced as Stony Brook&#x27;s fifth president. The late 2000s saw the university receive historic philanthropic donations. Hedge funder Jim Simons made multiple multi-million donations, including a $25 million donation to the Stony Brook Foundation in 2006, a $60 million donation for the development of the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics in 2008, and a landmark $150 million donation to the university in 2011. Other major donations were provided by alumni Joe Nathan, Stuart Goldstein, and Glenn Dubin for major renovation of athletic facilities. In 2010, Stanley announced Project 50 Forward, a comprehensive plan for the development of the university in the next 50 years with a focus on &quot;operational excellence, academic greatness, and building for the future.&quot;

In 2012, the $40 million Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center opened, soon followed by the on-campus Hilton Garden Inn in May 2013. Frey Hall, named after alumnus Robert Frey, opened in 2013 after undergoing renovations as the former Old Chemistry building. The Stony Brook University Arena underwent a $21 million overhaul, re-opening as the Island Federal Arena in 2014. In July 2015, a new $40.8 million Computer Science building opened, spanning . New dormitories, known as Chavez Hall and Tubman Hall, along with a new East Side Dining hall, opened in the fall of 2016. In January 2019, Stony Brook Medicine opened their $194 million cancer center to the public.

President Stanley left Stony Brook effective August 1, 2019, to become the president of Michigan State University following the Larry Nassar scandal. Provost Michael A. Bernstein was named interim president in his place. On March 26, 2020, Maurie McInnis, the executive vice president and provost of the University of Texas, was named the sixth president of Stony Brook, effective July 1, 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Army constructed $50 million temporary field hospitals on the campus of Stony Brook University. However, the beds were dismantled in 2021 without ever being used. A $63.4 million renovation of the Stony Brook Union was completed during the pandemic and opened in 2020.

=== Flagship status era ===
On January 5, 2022, New York Governor Kathy Hochul officially designated Stony Brook University and the University at Buffalo as the two flagship universities of the State University of New York system. The announcement came with the dedication of a new $100 million multidisciplinary engineering building. About three weeks later, Stony Brook announced its departure from the America East Conference after 21 years to the Colonial Athletic Association, effective July 1, 2022. Later that year, distinguished professor Dennis Sullivan earned the 2022 Abel Prize, the top honor in mathematics.

In the 2022–23 edition of the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; national college rankings, Stony Brook was ranked 77th, its highest-ever placement, as well as the first time that Stony Brook held sole possession of the highest-ranked public university in New York. It advanced to 58th the following year.

In April 2023, Stony Brook University was selected as the anchor institution for a new $700 million, 172-acre climate change research and education hub on Governors Island in New York City, set to open in 2028. Two months later, the university received a $500 million unrestricted gift from the Simons Foundation, the second-largest gift to a public university in U.S. history. McInnis stepped down in May 2024 to become the president at Yale University, and former Rutgers president Richard L. McCormick was named interim president. In February 2025, Princeton dean of engineering and applied science Andrea Goldsmith was named SBU&#x27;s seventh president.

==Campuses==
===Main campus===

The main campus is in the area of the historic North Shore hamlet of Stony Brook near the geographic midpoint of Long Island, approximately east of Manhattan and west of Montauk. Bounded to the north by New York State Route 25A (North Country Road), the campus is subdivided into &quot;West Campus&quot; and &quot;East Campus&quot; by the thoroughfare County Road 97 (Nicolls Road). The Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve separates the South Campus from West Campus. The Long Island Rail Road serves the community with the Stony Brook station situated along the northern edge of the campus.

The Stony Brook University campus area is a census-designated place (CDP), with a population of 10,409 at the 2020 census. As of the 2020 census, the U.S. Census Bureau defines the Stony Brook University CDP as a census-designated place separate from the CDP of Stony Brook.

The municipality containing the university is Town of Brookhaven. The university is not located in a village.

====West====
The West Campus is the center of the academic life of the university. It houses the majority of academic, athletic, and undergraduate student housing facilities while also being the original site of the university.

The modern campus is centered around the Academic Mall, which stretches for more than a quarter of a mile from the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics at the west end to the Administration Building at the east end. The Academic Mall includes the Student Activities Center, Frank Melville Jr. Memorial Library, Staller Center for the Arts, Humanities building, Psychology A &amp; B, Harriman Hall, Frey Hall (previously known as Old Chemistry), the Earth and Space Sciences building, Math Tower, and Physics building.
The Engineering Quad is located near the Academic Mall, and contains the Engineering, Light Engineering, Heavy Engineering, and Computing Center facilities. The Javits Lecture Center, Social and Behavioral Sciences building, Computer Science building, New Computer Science building and Student Union facilities are also on the West Campus. The Life Sciences complex, also on the West Campus, consists of the Life Sciences building, Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology, Centers for Molecular Medicine, Bioengineering building, and the Institute for Advanced Computational Science.
Among the latest additions to the campus are the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics, the new Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center, the Hilton Garden Inn hotel, Frey Hall, and a new Computer Science building. The Staller Center, which contains the largest movie screen in Long Island&#x27;s Suffolk County, holds the annual Stony Brook Film Festival.

The athletic facilities are in the northwest quadrant of West Campus, which include the Stony Brook Sports Complex, Island Federal Credit Union Arena, Kenneth P. LaValle Stadium, Joe Nathan Field, University Track, and University Field.

====South====
The South Campus is about half a mile south of the Academic Mall and separated from West Campus by the Ashley Schiff Forest Preserve. It is home to the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS), the Cody Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, and the University Police headquarters.

====Research and development====
The Research and Development Park is on Stony Brook Road, a mile from the center of campus. On November 3, 2005, the university announced it had formally acquired of the adjacent Flowerfield property, originally owned by the St. James Gyrodyne Company of America, through eminent domain, three years after the university had expressed its desire to acquire the property.

Stony Brook is using this property as a Research and Development Park, similar to other university-affiliated science parks around the country. The campus will ultimately house ten new buildings. The first building, the Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT), was completed in October 2008. CEWIT houses the world&#x27;s first (and currently the largest) immersive gigapixel facility in the world, called the Reality Deck. In 2019, Stony Brook University celebrated the opening of its new SMART Cluster in CEWIT, a dual-use GPU cluster for both machine learning and visualization. The SMART Cluster is also the first hardware-accelerated ray-tracing cluster for real-time cinematic quality rendering, allowing scientists, engineers and physicians to visualize huge amounts of data in a new way. Construction for the Advanced Energy Research and Technology Center, designed by Flad Architects, commenced in the summer of 2008 and opened in the spring of 2010.

====East====
The East Campus is separated from the main campus by Nicolls Road (County Road 97). It is home to the Stony Brook University Hospital and the Health Sciences Center. Stony Brook University Hospital, completed in 1980, is Suffolk County&#x27;s only tertiary hospital and Level 1 Trauma Center, and the only academic medical center in Suffolk County—larger also than any in Nassau County.
The hospital is the largest in Suffolk County, and the attached Health Sciences Center (HSC) and Basic Science Tower (BST) houses numerous laboratories, the School of Medicine (1972), the School of Nursing (1970), the School of Health Professions (1970) and the School of Social Welfare (1971). The area also includes the Ambulatory Surgery Center and the Center for Outpatient Services.

Construction on the Medical and Research Translation (MART) building began in November 2013, and the 240,000 square foot building opened on November 1, 2018, with its $194 million cost funded by state grants and donations from Jim Simons. The MART building is the home to the Stony Brook Cancer Center. In November 2019, Stony Brook Medicine opened a four-story, $73 million expansion to the Stony Brook Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Also in the east side of campus are the Chapin apartments, which provide housing for graduate students. The Long Island High Technology Incubator, one of the four business incubators of the university, is a short walk north of the hospital. The Long Island State Veterans Home serving the Long Island veteran community is in this part of campus.

===Manhattan campus===

In 2002, the university established a presence in Manhattan with the opening of Stony Brook Manhattan. The original site was at 401 Park Avenue South; a newer operation opened in late 2008 in the adjacent building on the third floor of 387 Park Avenue South. The university consolidated operations in 2011 to just the 3rd floor of 387 Park Avenue South, with a classroom entrance around the corner at 101 East 27th Street. The site allows Stony Brook to offer professional and graduate courses targeted towards students in New York City; undergraduate courses are held primarily during the summer and winter sessions. Conferences and special events take place throughout the year. In February 2017 however, the lease for this campus was terminated, and there are no classes offered at this location.

===Southampton campus===

On March 24, 2006, the university completed the purchase of the Southampton College (on the east end of Long Island) property from Long Island University with the intent to develop it as a full college campus focusing on academic programs related to the environment and sustainability. Stony Brook expanded its original program, started in Fall 2005, when it offered an undergraduate marine sciences program, with teaching and research facilities at the campus leased from Long Island University. An enrollment of about 2,000 students is expected within the next five years. Professor Martin Schoonen was appointed interim dean of Southampton campus on August 3, 2006, and conservationist Mary Pearl was appointed dean and vice president in March 2009.

On April 7, 2010, the university had suspended residential programs and transferred sustainability programs to the main campus. The change was prompted by severe state budget cuts. Although the Marine Sciences and Graduate Writing programs are still in session at Southampton, undergraduates were relocated to the main campus. As a result of the suspension of residential programs, all dining services and retail operations were suspended by the Faculty Student Association. The old LIU radio station and National Public Radio affiliate no longer operate on the campus.

In September 2011, Stony Brook Southampton began offering an undergraduate program called Semester by the Sea, where students attend undergraduate classes to study the ocean or the arts. Students studying the ocean are immersed in marine topics that are enhanced with close proximity to the water, a fleet of research vessels and graduate research projects that are ongoing. Students studying the arts are engaged in studies for filmmaking and creative writing. Both programs offer a Public Lecture Series.

As of 2015, the Stony Brook Southampton campus has shown growth, despite almost being closed down in 2010. Programs had been added back, and the board of trustees of the State University of New York approved a long-awaited partnership agreement between Southampton and Stony Brook University hospitals. Enrollment increased to over 400, after being around 175, three years following the addition of new funding.

As of 2019, Stony Brook University operates the Stony Brook Southampton Hospital with plans to take ownership of more eastern Long Island hospitals.

===South Korea===

Stony Brook University has operations in Incheon, South Korea as part of the Incheon Global Campus (IGC). The other schools involved include George Mason University, the University of Utah, Ghent University and the Fashion Institute of Technology.

In July 2011, Stanley announced that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in South Korea approved the establishment of SUNY Korea as part of Songdo International Business District in Incheon. The campus was expected to begin academic programs in March 2012 with an enrollment of 200. As of 2021, the student body contained roughly 1,000 students from over 40 countries. Its president is Arthur H. Lee, who was appointed to the role effective January 1, 2022. Stony Brook University students are allowed to apply for an exchange program at SUNY Korea, while SUNY Korea students are required to take a year of classes at Stony Brook University.

Beginning in 2017, FIT joined Stony Brook in offering degree programs at SUNY Korea.

===Art on campus===
Stony Brook University has four gallery spaces on campus. As was the desire of donor Paul W. Zuccaire, the Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery, formerly known as the University Art Gallery, showcases professional exhibitions as well as annual graduate and undergraduate student works. The Paul W. Zuccaire Gallery is in the Staller Center for the Arts.

Also on campus is the Latin American and Caribbean Studies Center&#x27;s Art Gallery, which features works from Latino and Latin American artists as well as local artists who fall under that category. The SAC Art Gallery is a center for interactive and participatory art projects.

The Tabler Center for Arts, Culture, and Humanities includes an art gallery and blackbox theater performance space. The Simons Center for Geometry and Physics includes an art gallery as well.

==Organization and administration==
The Stony Brook University consists of a main campus in Stony Brook, and additional satellite campuses in Southampton and South Korea. The university is composed of 12 schools and colleges. By enrollment, the largest college or school is the College of Arts and Sciences.

The university is governed by the State University of New York board of trustees, a body of 18 members, which regulate all the individual units of the SUNY system. The trustees have the authority to appoint the president of each state-operated institution; grant all degree diplomas and certificates for the completion of studies at any state-operated campus; and regulate admissions, tuition, curricula, and all other matters pertaining to the operation and administration of each state-operated campus. The president of Stony Brook is the principal executive officer of the university. The position was first held by John Francis Lee and is held by the sixth president in the institution&#x27;s history, Maurie McInnis, who took office on July 1, 2020.

===Endowment===
Stony Brook&#x27;s financial endowment is managed by the Stony Brook Foundation. The foundation was established in 1965 as a not-for-profit corporation under the New York State Education Law, chartered to collect and manage gifts from private and non-state resources to supplement the funding of the university and managed by a voluntary board of trustees. Donations can be made to a wide selection of funds which benefit different areas of the university.

In 2012, the endowment was valued at approximately $125 million with total assets amounting to nearly $350 million and has fully recovered from the losses endured in the 2008 economic downturn. After a strong fundraising campaign led by Jim Simon&#x27;s $150 million donation, the university&#x27;s fundraising amounted to more than $180 million for the 2011-12 year and raised $200 million by March 2013. It is the second largest endowment among State University of New York university centers behind the University at Buffalo. However, the university&#x27;s endowment remains far below the average of its Association of American Universities peers.

On June 1, 2023, The Simons Foundation announced a historic $500 million endowment gift, making it the largest unrestricted donation to an institution of higher education in U.S. history.

===Student government===

Housed in the Student Activities Center, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) is the governing body representing the undergraduate students of the university. The main functions of USG involve regulation, funding, and recognizing official clubs and organizations of the university. Undergraduate students are obligated to pay a Student Activity Fee per semester which is then administered by the Undergraduate Student Government. USG manages the yearly Homecoming events, Roth Pond Regatta and the traditional end-of-the year Brookfest concert and a series of concerts and events branded as &quot;Stony Brook Concerts&quot; that occur throughout the academic year while also directly funding undergraduate organizations, clubs, and other student services. USG at Stony Brook has a long history going back to the founding of the Student Polity Association (Polity) in 1959. After the controversial de-certification of Polity by the administration in 2002, USG was founded in 2003.

Like USG, the Graduate Student Organization (GSO) is the governing body representing the graduate students of the university. The GSO advocates for graduate student interests to senior university administration and is part of shared governance at the university. Graduate students pay a per-semester activity fee which is used to fund events and programs for the graduate community. The GSO provides services for graduate students including funding for conferences, seminars, speaker events, travel to Brookhaven and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, funding for social events, departmental organizations, and student clubs. The GSO hosts social events, professional development programming, and free legal and tax clinics. Traditional events hosted by the GSO include graduate student orientation, Three Minute Thesis, an annual speaker event, and national conferences. The GSO co-manages the University Cafe. GSO executive board members partake in national advocacy, and work with organizations such as the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS) on advocating for higher education policy issues.

==Academics==

Stony Brook was one of ten national universities awarded a National Science Foundation recognition award in 1998 for their integration of research and education. Between 2005 and 2007, two Nobel Prizes were awarded to professors for their work conducted at Stony Brook. The university has an annual $4.65 billion economic impact on the region. Stony Brook co-manages Brookhaven National Laboratory through Brookhaven Science Associates, a 50-50 partnership with Battelle Memorial Institute. Stony Brook is also one of two public schools in New York to have a medical school and a dental school, the other being University at Buffalo.

The university&#x27;s health science and medical component, collectively referred to as Stony Brook Medicine, includes the Renaissance School of Medicine and the Schools of Dental Medicine, Nursing, Health Professions, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Social Welfare, as well as the Hospital, major centers and institutes, programs, clinics and community-based healthcare settings, and the Long Island State Veterans Home.

===Tuition===
For the 2021–22 academic year, annual undergraduate tuition and fees was $10,410 for in-state students and $28,080 for out-of-state students. Tuition alone cost $7,070 and $24,740, respectively, with $3,020 in fees. Average room and board cost is $14,884.

78% of full-time enrolled freshmen received financial aid, with an average of $13,100 per student. 71% of full-time enrolled freshmen received a scholarship or aid from a federal or state government institution. 42% of full-time enrolled freshmen received loan aid from the federal government at an average of $5,000 per student.

===Undergraduate admissions===
Admission to Stony Brook University is classified as &quot;more selective&quot; by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The Princeton Review gives Stony Brook an &quot;Admissions Selectivity Rating&quot; of 93.

In 2023, the university received 50,341 applications. It extended offers of admission to 24,670 applicants, or 49%, after holistic review that includes examination of academic rigor, performance and admissions test scores. 3,569 accepted students chose to enroll, a yield rate of 14.5%.

Stony Brook does not require applicants to submit a standardized test score. Of the 36% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted SAT scores, the interquartile range for math and reading was 680–770 and 640–720 respectively. Of the 3% of incoming students in 2023 who submitted ACT scores, the interquartile range was 28–33. Of all matriculating students, the average high school GPA is 93.52 on a 100-point scale.

===Rankings and reputation===

In 2023, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Stony Brook University 58th overall among national universities and 26th among public universities. In 2022, the QS US University Rankings ranked Stony Brook University as No. 39 in the US. In 2023, Stony Brook University was again ranked the top public university in New York.

In 2020, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranked Stony Brook University tied with two others as the second-best public school in the Northeastern United States.

In 2015, &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; ranked Stony Brook 33rd best value among the country&#x27;s public institutions for in-state students, and 26th for out-of-state students.

===Research===
Stony Brook University is a public research institution, classified as &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. It is one of 71 member universities of the Association of Universities (AAU) and one of 94 members of the Universities Research Association (URA), both representing the leading North American research universities.

The university co-manages Brookhaven National Laboratory, which is affiliated with the United States Department of Energy. In the Physical Sciences, Mathematics and Engineering area, some of the research centers of Stony Brook University are the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the Institute for Advanced Computational Science, and the C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics among others. In the biomedical sciences, Stony Brook houses the Center for Biotechnology and the Institute of Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, among many others. In March 2008, the university received $60 million endowment from James Simons to establish the Simons Center for Geometry and Physics. The Louis and Beatrice Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology was established by a generous gift in 2008 from Henry Laufer.

The School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) is the SUNY center for marine and atmospheric research, education, and public service. More than 300 graduate and undergraduate students from 16 different nations work and study at SoMAS. The School&#x27;s students study coastal oceanographic processes and atmospheric sciences. The Marine Sciences Research Center, the original institute for marine studies, was incorporated into the new School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences on June 15, 2007.

In July 2007, Stony Brook won a grant from the Department of Defense to devise ways to prevent terrorists from corrupting computers, and another from the Department of Homeland Security to design a system to detect radiation without triggering false alarms.

The New York Center for Computational Sciences (NYCCS), formed in 2007, is a joint venture of Stony Brook University and Brookhaven National Laboratory. Its centerpiece is an 18-rack Blue Gene /L and 2 rack Blue Gene/P massively parallel supercomputer
based on the IBM system-on-chip technology, also known as New York Blue Gene supercomputer. In the June 2008 Top 500 supercomputer rankings New York Blue Gene/L was ranked 17th, and Blue Gene/P was ranked 75th. The total peak performance for both Blue Gene/L and Blue Gene/P consists 103.22 teraflops (trillion floating-point calculations per second).

====Notable research and discoveries====
There have been many notable research projects and important scientific discoveries at Stony Brook.


==Student life==
Stony Brook has a wide variety of student-run organizations on campus, which include sororities and fraternities, and a count of almost 300 recognized student clubs and organizations. The Undergraduate Student Government at Stony Brook University is trusted with the responsibility of budgeting the undergraduate student activity fee which funds most student run organizations on campus. The Graduate Student Organization is responsible for budgeting the graduate student activity fee, and supplies a variety of funding opportunities, programming, student services, and funding for departmental and student organizations.

The oldest campus newspaper is &quot;The Statesman&quot;, which was founded in 1957 when the university was in Oyster Bay. Other publications include the &quot;Stony Brook Press&quot;, &quot;Stony Brook Independent&quot;, &quot;Blackworld&quot;, and the Asian American E-Zine. Stony Brook also has a campus-wide public radio station, WUSB, which serves most of Long Island and dedicates programming to Stony Brook athletics and other events on campus.

Stony Brook once had a reputation as a commuter school, though in 2024, more than half of its undergraduates live on campus, as do a quarter of its graduate students. Around 83% of freshmen students are on-campus residents. Other schools have since adopted similar practices to increase residential numbers.

===Student body===
In fall 2021, the university had an enrollment of 26,782 students: 18,010 undergraduate students and 8,772 graduate students.

Of all students, 23,072 (86 percent) are U.S. citizens or permanent residents representing all states of the United States and 3,536 (13 percent) are international students representing over a hundred countries around the world.

21,103 students hail from New York state, accounting for 79 percent of the student body. 12,061 students (45 percent) of the student body reside in Nassau or Suffolk County on Long Island, while 6,766 students (25 percent) reside in New York City.

2,276 students (8.5 percent) reside north of New York City, with Westchester County, Rockland County and Orange County as the three most common. 7.3 percent of students live out of state, most represented by New Jersey, California and Connecticut.

Half of Stony Brook&#x27;s international students hail from China. An additional 18% come from India and 10% from South Korea. In 2021, there were more Asian American undergraduate students than White American students attending Stony Brook for the first time in the university&#x27;s history.

===Events and traditions===

Incoming freshmen are welcomed to the university in August with First Night Out, a night of events taking place on the Friday in which they move in. Organized by Student Engagement and Activities, the night consists of a &quot;Party on the Plaza&quot; as well as various assorted activities. Wolfieland, an annual carnival, began in 2016 and takes place during September. Stony Brook University&#x27;s annual Homecoming celebration, known as Wolfstock, takes place in October and features numerous activities throughout the week, including Homecoming Hoopla &amp; Carnival on Wednesday and the Seawolves Showcase talent show on Friday. Wolfstock culminates in Stony Brook&#x27;s annual Homecoming football game on Saturday, which traditionally draws record-breaking crowds upwards of 12,000 people. The homecoming court is presented during halftime, dating back to 1984. Beginning in 2018, Stony Brook shifted to the gender-neutral title of &#x27;royal&#x27; in lieu of &#x27;king&#x27; and &#x27;queen&#x27;.

Academic activity pauses weekly on Wednesdays from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. in a period known as Campus Life Time, which was established in February 1991. During Campus Life Time, no classes are scheduled and events take place at the Academic Mall, allowing students to take a break from their studies and come together for social activity.

First-year students are assigned a book written by a notable figure, who speaks to the entire freshman class on Commons Day in the fall semester. Commons Day speakers have included Supreme Court associate justice Sonia Sotomayor, author Janet Mock, designer Joshua Davis and journalist Charles M. Blow.

The Festival of Lights started in 2000 as an annual Stony Brook tradition that celebrates the numerous cultures and faiths which celebrate during the holiday season. The festival is preceded by Light the Brook, a tree lighting ceremony at the Academic Mall. Midnight Breakfast takes place during the first Monday of Finals Week in both semesters as the dining halls open late to serve breakfast foods to students.

To celebrate Earth Day, Stony Brook holds a week-long Earthstock celebration in the week culminating in the Earthstock Festival. Numerous environment-themed events take place throughout the week, with the most known tradition being the Rubber Duck Race held at &quot;The Brook&quot; adjacent to the Administration building.

Starting in 1993, Strawberry Fest is held on the first Wednesday of May, where students and faculty gather at the Academic Mall to eat an array of strawberry-themed foods with live music and student performances. In 1998, Stony Brook began to hold Diversity Day during the same day as Strawberry Fest, planned and organized by the Office of Multicultural Affairs to highlight the diverse cultures which make up the university.

The yearly Roth Pond Regatta, held since 1989, attracts dozens of competitors and thousands of attendees, including students, faculty, staff, and alumni. The competition involves groups making boats out of cardboard and tape, with the challenge to get across the Roth Pond first without sinking.
Stony Brook holds two annual concerts – Back to the Brook during the fall semester and Brookfest during the spring semester. The inaugural Back to the Brook took place in 2012 and featured Reel Big Fish at the Staller Steps. Since then, Mac Miller, Lupe Fiasco, Walk the Moon, Fetty Wap and Post Malone have headlined Back to the Brook. 2018&#x27;s Back to the Brook was infamously cancelled after only 24 tickets were sold for headliner Ashanti a week before the concert. 2019&#x27;s Back to the Brook was controversially cancelled again. The historic Stony Brook concert series was revived in 2011 with Brookfest hosting headliners Bruno Mars and Janelle Monáe. Brookfest has since been headlined by Wiz Khalifa and Miguel, Ludacris and Grouplove, Childish Gambino and Diplo, Panic! at the Disco and Twenty One Pilots, Future and Cash Cash, DNCE and Joey Badass, 21 Savage and A Boogie wit da Hoodie, and ASAP Ferg and Aminé.

In the early 2010s, Stony Brook&#x27;s Graduate Student Organization sponsored a concert series on the first Thursday of every month titled Stony Brooklyn, focused on exposing the student body to up-and-coming indie rock musicians from the New York area. This concert series included acts like The Antlers, Parquet Courts, Beach Fossils, The Drums, Ra Ra Riot, Das Racist and The Front Bottoms playing concerts on the Stony Brook campus. As interest in this scene declined, the series was shut down by 2017.

===Spirit of Stony Brook marching band===

The Spirit of Stony Brook marching band was created in 2006 by Jerrold Stein, the dean of students at the time, and plays at athletic games and other events. The first public performance was at the September 2006 convocation. The band grew to 70 members in the second year and added additional staff. The band first traveled to the America East men&#x27;s basketball tournament in March 2007 and has done so regularly ever since. By July 2008, the band had reached 100 members, and by the mid-2010s had attracted over 200 members. John Leddy was the first director of the marching band, from 2006 to 2013. Leddy was followed by Shayna Stahl (2013-2016) and Christopher Parks (2016-2018). Justin Stolarik has been the band director since 2018.

==Athletics==

Stony Brook University&#x27;s intercollegiate athletics teams, known as the Stony Brook Seawolves, compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level and are members of the Colonial Athletic Association, beginning on July 1, 2022. The school&#x27;s current director of athletics is Shawn Heilbron, who was hired in May 2014 after serving as Senior Associate Athletic Director for Development at Oregon State University.

The university&#x27;s athletics teams were originally known as the Soundmen or the Baymen in the early 1950s when the campus was located in Oyster Bay. Their name was changed to the Warriors in 1960, and again to the Patriots and Lady Patriots in 1966. In 1994, as Stony Brook prepared to become a Division I program, the team nickname was changed again, this time to its current day incarnation, the Seawolves. The team&#x27;s mascot is named Wolfie.

Beginning in 2019, Stony Brook announced a partnership with SNY to broadcast football, basketball and lacrosse games on the channel. Stony Brook games on WUSB were announced by Josh Caray, grandson of famed broadcaster Harry Caray and son of Skip Caray until his departure in 2019.

The Stony Brook Patriots participated at the Division III level until 1995, when they moved up to Division II with the ultimate goal of soon reaching Division I. On June 3, 1997, President Shirley Kenny announced that the Seawolves&#x27; entire athletics program would play at the Division I level beginning during the 1999–00 season. Stony Brook joined the America East Conference in 2001 until leaving in 2022 and also played women&#x27;s tennis in the Missouri Valley Conference.

Stony Brook garnered national attention during their 2012 College World Series run. The Seawolves upset the LSU Tigers in a three-game series to win the Baton Rouge Super Regional and reach the College World Series in Omaha, the first America East team to do so. Coach Matt Senk was awarded the National College Baseball Writers Association&#x27;s Coach of the Year award. Outfielder Travis Jankowski was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the first round of the 2012 MLB Draft.

After going winless in four consecutive America East Finals in men&#x27;s basketball, the Seawolves earned their first bid to the NCAA tournament in 2016 by defeating the Vermont Catamounts 80–74. They lost to Kentucky in the first round of the NCAA Tournament by a score of 85–57.

Stony Brook has established itself as a dominant force in women&#x27;s lacrosse. Since 2013, the Seawolves have finished in first place in the America East for eight straight seasons, making eight consecutive NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Lacrosse Championship tournaments. During the 2018 season, the Seawolves were ranked No. 1 nationally in all three major polls (IWLCA Coaches&#x27; Poll, Cascade/Inside Lacrosse, Nike/US Lacrosse) for at least ten weeks.

In recent years, Stony Brook&#x27;s athletic facilities have undergone several additions and renovations. The Goldstein Family Student-Athlete Development Center opened in 2006 after a million-dollar donation by alumnus Stuart Goldstein. In 2011, Joe Nathan Field, dedicated to six-time MLB All-Star relief pitcher and Stony Brook alumnus Joe Nathan, opened after renovations to the former University Field were made possible by Nathan&#x27;s $500,000 donation. Island Federal Arena, formerly known as the Stony Brook University Arena, opened in 2014 after a two-year, $21.1 million renovation. The Pritchard Gymnasium, current home of the volleyball team and former home of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2008. Alumnus Glenn Dubin donated $4.3 million to a strength and conditioning facility named the Dubin Family Athletic Performance Center, which opened in 2012. The Dubin family also pledged $5 million for a $10 million for the Dubin Family Indoor Training Center, which opened in 2020.

== Transportation ==
In 2013, Stony Brook University launched its own bike share system to provide a sustainable transportation alternative for students (Wolf Ride Bike Share). As of 2016, the university provides 8 stations and 63 bikes. Docking stations and bikes are supplied by PBSC Urban Solutions.

There is also a system of buses operated by the university. This system is accessible to anyone on the Stony Brook Campus at no charge.

The university is located next to the Stony Brook LIRR station on the Port Jefferson Line.

The university is served by Suffolk County Transit Route 51, operating between Patchogue Railroad and Port Jefferson Railroad via Smith Haven Mall.

<text>Coventry Kersey Dighton Patmore (23 July 1823 – 26 November 1896) was an English poet and literary critic. He is best known for his book of poetry &quot;The Angel in the House&quot;, a narrative poem about the Victorian ideal of a happy marriage. As a young man, Patmore worked for the British Museum in London. After the publication of his first book of poems in 1844, he became acquainted with members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. His grief over the death of his first wife, Emily Augusta Patmore in 1862, became a major theme in his poetry.

==Early life==
The eldest son of author Peter George Patmore, Coventry Patmore was born at Woodford in Essex and was privately educated. The boy was very close to his father Peter and showed an early interest in literature. Coventry Patmore&#x27;s first goal was to become an artist; he earned the silver palette of the Society of Arts in 1838. In 1839, his family sent Patmore to school in France for six months, where he began to write poetry. On his return to England, Peter Patmore planned to publish some of his son&#x27;s youthful poems; however, Coventry Patmore had become interested in science, and set aside writing poetry.
In 1846, with help from Richard Monckton Milnes, Coventry Patmore was appointed as the printed book supernumary assistant at the British Museum. He would hold this position for the next 19 years, while devoting his spare time to writing poetry. In 1847, Patmore married Emily Augusta Andrews, the daughter of Dr. Andrews of Camberwell. By 1851, the couple had two sons: Coventry (born 1848) and Tennyson (born 1850). Three daughters followed – Emily Honoria (born 1853), Bertha (born 1855) and Gertrude (born 1857), before their last child, a son (Henry John), was born in 1860. Emily Augusta Patmore wrote under the pseudonym of Mrs Motherly. In 1859, she published &quot;The Servant&#x27;s Behaviour Book, or, Hints on Manners and Dress for Maid Servants in Small Households,&quot; a conduct book for women in domestic service, written in a clear, practical manner. &quot;Nursery Poetry&quot; (1859) features lively verses on household matters, while &quot;Nursery Tales&quot; (1860) is improving and moralistic in tone. She is also considered to have had a significant role in the creation of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Garland&quot; (1862), her husband&#x27;s anthology of poems.

Inspired by the literary success of Alfred Tennyson, Patmore devoted more energy to his writing. In 1844, he published a small volume of &quot;Poems&quot;, which had limited commercial success. However, Patmore was more upset by a harsh review of his work in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; Discouraged&quot;,&quot; Patmore bought up the remainder of the edition and destroyed it. His friends encouraged him to keep writing and gave him valuable feedback. Furthermore, the publication of &quot;Poems&quot; enabled him to network with other literary figures, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti introduced Patmore to William Holman Hunt, who brought Patmore into the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, contributing his poem &quot;The Seasons&quot; to &quot;The Germ&quot;.

During his time at the British Museum, Patmore was instrumental in starting the Volunteer Movement in 1852. He wrote an important letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on the subject, and stirred up much enthusiasm among his colleagues. He also introduced academic David Masson to Emily Rosaline Orme, his wife Emily&#x27;s niece, both of whom were strong supporters for women&#x27;s suffrage and rights.

== Major publications ==
In 1853, Patmore republished &quot;Tamerton Church Tower&quot;, the more successful of his pieces from &quot;Poems&quot; of 1844. He also added several new poems that showed more sophistication in conception and treatment. In 1854, Patmore published the first part of his best-known poem, &quot;The Angel in the House&quot;. &quot;The Angel in the House&quot; is a long narrative and lyric poem, with four parts published between 1854 and 1862: 

* &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1854)
* &quot;The Espousals&quot; (1856), which eulogise his first wife;
* &quot;Faithful for Ever&quot; (1860)
* &quot;The Victories of Love&quot; (1862)

Patmore published the four works together in 1863. The works have come to symbolise the Victorian feminine ideal – which was not necessarily the ideal amongst feminists of the period.

By 1861 Patmore and his family were living in Elm Cottage, North End, Hampstead. On 5 July 1862 Emily Patmore died after a long illness, and shortly afterwards Patmore joined the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1864 Patmore married Marianne Byles, daughter of James Byles of Bowden Hall, Gloucester. Patmore Buxted Hall in Surrey in 1865, which he described in &quot;How I managed my Estate&quot; (1886). In 1877 Patmore published &quot;The Unknown Eros&quot;, which some commentators believe contains his finest poetic work, and in 1878 &quot;Amelia&quot;, his own favourite among his poems, together with an essay on &quot;English Metrical Law&quot;. This departure into criticism continued in 1879 with a volume of papers entitled &quot;Principle in Art&quot;, and again in 1893 with &quot;Religio Poetae&quot;.

Patmore&#x27;s second wife Marianne died in 1880, and in 1881 he married Harriet Robson from Bletchingley in Surrey (born 1840), his children&#x27;s governess. Their son Francis was born in 1882. Patmore also had a deep friendship with the poet Alice Meynell, lasting several years. He ultimately fell in love with her, forcing Meynell to end their relationship.

In later years Patmore lived at Lymington, where he died in 1896. He was buried in Lymington churchyard.

==Evaluation==
A collected edition of Patmore&#x27;s poems appeared in two volumes in 1886, with a characteristic preface which might serve as the author&#x27;s epitaph. &quot;I have written little&quot;, it runs; &quot;but it is all my best; I have never spoken when I had nothing to say, nor spared time or labour to make my words true. I have respected posterity; and should there be a posterity which cares for letters, I dare to hope that it will respect me.&quot; The sincerity which underlies this statement, combined with a certain lack of humour which peers through its naïveté, points to two of the principal characteristics of Patmore&#x27;s earlier poetry; characteristics which came to be almost unconsciously merged and harmonized as his style and his intention drew together into unity.

As happy love had been his earlier, the grief of loss became, in great measure, his later theme; touching and sublime thoughts upon love, death, and immortality are conveyed through strikingly poetic imagery and unusual form in the odes of &quot;The Unknown Eros&quot;, his best work. The collection is full not only of passages but entire poems in which exalted thought is expressed in poetry of the richest and most dignified melody. Spirituality informs his inspiration; the poetry is glowing and alive. The magnificent piece in praise of winter, the solemn and beautiful cadences of &quot;Departure&quot;, and the homely but elevated pathos of &quot;The Toys&quot;, are in their manner unsurpassed in English poetry. His somewhat reactionary political opinions, which also find expression in his odes, find less praise today although they can certainly be said to reflect, as do his essays, a serious and very active mind. Patmore is today one of the least-known but best-regarded Victorian poets.

His son Henry John Patmore (1860–1883) also became a poet.

<text>RuneScape is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Jagex, released in January 2001. &quot;RuneScape&quot; was originally a browser game built with the Java programming language; it was largely replaced by a standalone C++ client in 2016. The game has had over 300 million accounts created and was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the largest and most-updated free MMORPG.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; takes place in the world of Gielinor, a medieval fantasy realm divided into different kingdoms, regions, and cities. Players can travel throughout Gielinor via a number of methods including on foot, magical spells, or charter ships. Each region offers different types of monsters, resources, and quests to challenge players. The game&#x27;s fictional universe has been explored through a tie-in video game on another of its maker&#x27;s websites, &quot;FunOrb&quot;, &quot;Armies of Gielinor&quot;, and the novels &quot;Betrayal at Falador&quot;, &quot;Return to Canifis&quot;, and &quot;Legacy of Blood&quot;.

Players are represented in the game with customisable avatars. &quot;RuneScape&quot; does not follow a linear storyline; rather, players set their own goals and objectives. Players can choose to fight non-player character (NPC) monsters, complete quests, or increase their experience in the available skills. Players interact with each other through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play.

The first public version of &quot;RuneScape&quot; was released in January 2001 in beta form, with Jagex as its copyright holder being formed later that year. In 2004, as the game&#x27;s popularity grew, the game engine was rewritten and released as &quot;RuneScape 2&quot;, with the original version of the game being renamed &quot;RuneScape Classic&quot;. The third iteration of the game, known as &quot;RuneScape 3&quot;, was released in July 2013. &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot;, a separate, older version of the game dating from August 2007, was released in February 2013, and is maintained alongside the original client. It was announced that mobile ports of both versions of &quot;RuneScape&quot; would be released for Android and iOS devices in 2018. &quot;RuneScape&quot; was released on Steam on 14 October 2020.

==Gameplay==
Players begin in a secluded area called Tutorial Island, where they are taken through a tutorial, a set path where they learn the most basic skills in &quot;RuneScape&quot;. After the tutorial, players have access to tutors and advisors located in the towns they explore, who can give players appropriate information about their respective skills. Originally players were teleported to the town of Lumbridge, however in recent updates, Burthorpe is the main starting area. Other main cities include Varrock, Falador, Ardougne (and West Ardougne), and smaller settlements.

Players set their own goals and objectives as they play the game. They can train their in-game skills, engage non-player character (NPC) monsters and other players in combat and complete quests at their discretion. Players interact with each other through trading, chatting or by participating in mini-games.

===Skills===
There are 29 skills in &quot;RuneScape&quot;, 17 skills available to free-to-play players and an additional 12 for members, which enable players to perform various activities allowing for interaction with NPCs, the environment and other players. Players gain experience points in a skill when they use it. For example, mining an ore trains the mining skill, and when the player accumulates enough experience points in the skill, their character will &quot;level up&quot;. As a skill level rises, the ability to retrieve better raw materials and produce better products increases, as does the experience awarded if the player uses new abilities. The total skill level of a player partly symbolises the player&#x27;s status in the game and subscribers with a high total level can appear on the high scores. Upon reaching the highest available level in a skill, members may buy a special cape to symbolise their achievement.

Some skills, such as woodcutting and fishing, enable the player to collect raw materials that can be processed into usable items for other skills, such as fletching and cooking respectively. The items created can be used by the player or sold to shops and other players. Other skills allow players to kill certain NPCs, build their own houses, move around the map with greater ease, steal from various NPCs, market stalls and chests located in-game, light fires, cook their own food, create their own potions, craft runestones and weapons, plant their own plants, hunt NPC animals, raid dungeons, and summon familiars to assist in combat and training skills.

===Combat===
&quot;RuneScape&quot; features a semi-real-time combat system. Combat is an important aspect of the game, allowing players to defeat monsters to obtain dropped items or to complete quests. A combat level is an indicator of how powerful a player or NPC is in combat. For players, it is determined by applying a mathematical formula to their combat skills. Players engage in combat by clicking on the enemy they want their character to attack and will automatically continue fighting until they kill their opponent, die, or retreat from the fight. Most of the game&#x27;s weapons are medieval or fantastical in nature, and feature different strengths and weaknesses. Players may summon a familiar to assist with combat, use special attacks called &quot;abilities&quot; to deal additional damage, and use potions and the Prayer skill to boost their combat prowess.

Combat is subdivided into four main categories: melee, magic, ranged and necromancy. Melee attacks are close range, magic attacks focus on using runestones to cast spells, ranged attacks use projectile weapons like arrows, darts or throwing knives, and necromancy combines direct attacks with the summoning of undead combatants to fight alongside the player. The first three combat types make up a &quot;Combat Triangle&quot;, which governs effectiveness of styles in a rock-paper-scissors fashion; melee beats ranged, ranged beats magic, magic beats melee, and each style is neutral to itself. Necromancy is a standalone method of combat and is neutral to the other styles. The advantages and disadvantages of the combat triangle apply to both NPCs and player opponents. Players are not required to choose a character class nor are they bound to a specific category of combat. They may freely change between or combine the styles of combat by switching weapons and armour.

Combat is governed by a life points system. Every combatant has a maximum capacity of life points, and dies when their health is depleted to 0. Lost life points can be recovered by consuming certain food or drinks, or casting abilities. Players who die reappear at a respawn point of their choice with their life and skill points restored; however, they drop all but three chosen items, as well as certain common items. Dying spawns a gravestone that will hold all of the player&#x27;s items and will last for an allotted time; however, there are situations in which all items will be lost upon death. If the player does not return in time, the grave will collapse and their items will disappear.

In June 2012 players were invited to beta-test a new combat system named &quot;Evolution of Combat&quot;, which included fundamental changes such as re-balancing the Combat Triangle to avoid favouring melee attacks, and replacing special weapon attacks with abilities that produce a range of effects when activated. The system was released on the live game on 20 November 2012. Various polls were also added for players to vote on in game that would determine the result of future content development, some of which would dictate the development of the improved combat system. A beta for a separate combat system dubbed &quot;Legacy Mode&quot; was opened to players on 16 June 2014, before being introduced to the live game on 14 July. Legacy Mode allows players to switch to the combat system and interface from prior to June 2012 instead of the Evolution of Combat system.

====Player versus player combat====
Player versus player combat (PvP) can be performed in specific controlled mini-games and in an area known as the Wilderness. The &quot;Duel Arena&quot; allows players to stake money and items, while other PvP games offer their own rewards. In the Wilderness, players can engage in combat provided that their combat levels fall within a certain range of each other, and if a player kills their opponent they will be able to claim their opponent&#x27;s items as a reward.

Before December 2007, players went to the Wilderness to fight other players within a certain combat level range, hoping to kill them and gain their items. In December 2007, the Wilderness was altered to prevent players from transferring in-game items for real-world currency. PvP combat was removed from the Wilderness and temporarily restricted to new mini-games named &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; and &quot;Clan Wars&quot;. &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; was replaced by special &quot;Bounty Worlds&quot; on 6 May 2009 in which players were confined to the Wilderness and could be assigned specific targets to kill. &quot;PvP Worlds&quot; were introduced on 15 October 2008 where players could fight almost anywhere in Gielinor, but these and &quot;Bounty Worlds&quot; were removed when PvP combat in the Wilderness was restored on 1 February 2011.

===Non-player interaction===
Non-player characters (NPCs) populate the realm of Gielinor. Some NPCs, such as shopkeepers and some characters in quests, are unavailable for combat. However, most NPCs can be attacked and these are generally referred to as monsters. Monsters range from common, low-level creatures, such as chickens and goblins, to unique and often much more powerful monsters, such as the Queen Black Dragon, Telos, and Vorago.

Most monsters have their own strengths and weaknesses, notable exceptions being certain bosses, which have no specific weaknesses. Demons, for example, have a weak defence against ranged attacks, while metal dragons have extremely high defence against ranged. The weakness of an individual monster is displayed in an interface above its model, along with its combat level and lifepoints.

Monsters may either be aggressive or non-aggressive. Non-aggressive monsters ignore players unless attacked, while aggressive monsters may attack all players or may only attack players with combat levels below a specified level, depending on the circumstances or location. This can make certain areas throughout Gielinor dangerous or inconvenient to players with lower combat levels.

===Player interaction===
Players can interact with each other through trading, chatting, or by participating in mini-games and activities, some of which are competitive or combative in nature, while others require cooperative or collaborative play. Players can trade items and gold coins with each other, either through a face-to-face trade, or by using a large automated marketplace known as the Grand Exchange.

The chat system enables players to communicate with each other. Public Chat broadcasts text to players in the local area on one server, both by text appearing above the speaker&#x27;s head and in the message box. Friends Chat broadcasts text in the message box only to certain players tuned into a specific channel, who can be available on any &quot;RuneScape&quot; world. Each Friends Chat channel has an owner, who can assign different ranks to individual players; players&#x27; ranks dictate their ability to perform administrative tasks within the channel. Clan Chat allows members of a clan to communicate with each other through a separate channel. Quick Chat allows players to choose from a list of predetermined messages to send as Public Chat, Clan Chat, or Friends Chat.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; features independent mini-games, although most are only available to paying members. Mini-games take place in certain areas and normally involve specific in-game skills, and usually require players to cooperate or to compete with each other. Examples of these mini-games include &quot;Castle Wars&quot;, which is similar to the real-life game Capture the Flag, &quot;Pest Control&quot;, a highly combat-focused mini-game, and &quot;Fist of Guthix&quot;, where one player (the hunter) tries to stop another player (the hunted) from collecting charges into a magical stone.

===Quests===
Quests are series of tasks with a storyline that players can choose to complete. These often have requirements including minimum levels in certain skills, combat levels, quest points and/or the completion of other quests. Players receive various rewards for completion of quests, including money, unique items, access to new areas, quest points and/or increases in skill experience. Some quests require players to work together, and many require players to engage in challenging combat. Quests are grouped into categories based on requirements and difficulty. Once a player completes all quests in the game, an achievement item known as the &quot;Quest Point Cape&quot; can be claimed. New quests are released periodically.

==Development==

Andrew Gower developed &quot;RuneScape&quot; with the assistance of his brother Paul Gower. It was originally conceived as a text-based MUD, but graphics were incorporated early in development, adding it to the ranks of what were then known as &quot;graphical MUDs&quot;. The first public version of the game used a mixture of three-dimensional and two-dimensional sprites. It was released as a beta version on 4 January 2001, and originally operated out of their parents&#x27; house in Nottingham. In December 2001, the Gower brothers, along with Constant Tedder, formed Jagex to take over the business aspects of running &quot;RuneScape&quot;. Among its early innovations Jagex developed an interpreted domain-specific scripting language called RuneScript, which is used by &quot;RuneScape&quot;″s server for event handling. In February 2002, a monthly membership service was introduced, allowing access to additional features including new areas, quests, and items not available to free users.

As the game gained more users, Jagex began planning major changes. The developers rewrote the game engine, producing a new version of the game with entirely three-dimensional graphics called &quot;RuneScape 2&quot;. A beta version of &quot;RuneScape 2&quot; was released to paying members for a testing period beginning on 1 December 2003, and ending in March 2004. Upon its official release, &quot;RuneScape 2&quot; was renamed simply &quot;RuneScape&quot;, while the older version of the game was kept online under the name &quot;RuneScape Classic&quot;. On 12 January 2006, Jagex banned more than 5,000 &quot;Classic&quot; accounts for cheating. To prevent further cheating, &quot;Classic&quot; was closed to new accounts and access was restricted to accounts who had played it at least once between 3 August 2005 and 12 January 2006. Additional reopenings took place in November 2009, June 2010 and September 2011.

To support &quot;RuneScape&quot; free content, advertisements appear on a banner above the playing screen on the free-to-play servers. Since computer users may use advertisement blockers, which may discourage advertisers, Jagex introduced a rule that prohibits players from blocking these advertisements. On 13 July 2006, Jagex signed an exclusive marketing and distribution contract with WildTangent Games, which granted WildTangent the right to handle advertising in and around &quot;RuneScape&quot; in the United States, and to distribute &quot;RuneScape&quot; through the WildTangent Games Network, reaching over 20 million consumer PCs.

On 16 May 2006, Jagex upgraded &quot;RuneScape&quot;″s game engine, improving the game&#x27;s loading times and reducing its memory requirements. On 1 July 2008, Jagex released a beta of their &quot;High Detail&quot; mode for members, which was extended to free players two weeks later. Before the launch, Jagex stated that it would be revealed at the 2008 E3 trade show.

On 14 February 2007, a German translation of &quot;RuneScape&quot; was introduced, followed by a French translation on 11 December 2008, Brazilian Portuguese on 24 July 2009, and Latin American Spanish on 25 April 2013. In an interview in May 2008, former Jagex CEO Geoff Iddison stated that, &quot;We do plan to go East with [&quot;RuneScape&quot;] to the Asian market and the Eastern European market too&quot; [...] &quot;&quot;RuneScape&quot; is not for Japan, but it could work well in Malaysia for example. And where&#x27;s India in all this? I think &quot;RuneScape&quot; is a game that would be adopted in the English-speaking Indian world and the local-speaking Indian world. We&#x27;re looking at all those markets individually.&quot; &quot;RuneScape&quot; later launched in India through the gaming portal Zapak on 8 October 2009, and in France and Germany through Bigpoint Games on 27 May 2010.

On 28 February 2012, an in-game feature was introduced called the &quot;Squeal of Fortune&quot; that allowed players to win items on a daily basis by spinning the wheel. On 2 April 2012, it became possible for players to spend real-world currency in exchange for additional spins, introducing a form of microtransaction to the game. Jagex CEO Mark Gerhard had previously described microtransactions as &quot;a stealth tax&quot;, and the update provoked complaints from players who believed they had been &quot;betrayed&quot; by the change. In July 2012, Jagex released Solomon&#x27;s General Store, making it possible to spend real currency in exchange for &quot;RuneCoins&quot; that could be spent on cosmetic rewards in the game. On 29 August 2012, Gerhard released a response to this controversy, describing these microtransactions as &quot;[having] a significant role in ensuring that we can continue to support, develop and grow the game for many more years to come.&quot; He states that while these decisions are &quot;not necessarily popular&quot;, they are made with the future of &quot;RuneScape&quot; in mind. On 4 February 2014, the Squeal of Fortune was replaced with Treasure Hunter. Rather than spinning a wheel for prizes, players are given keys which are used to open a chest of their choosing. On 26 March 2014, Gerhard reiterated his stance on microtransactions and their importance in updating &quot;RuneScape&quot;, and announced a partnership with Supersonic ads, allowing players to earn RuneCoins by watching advertisements or sampling products.

On 30 August 2012, Gerhard announced that an HTML5 version of &quot;RuneScape&quot; was in development that would allow the game to be played on &quot;your favourite tablets, platforms and even smart TVs.&quot; A video released on 22 March 2013 stated that the new version would be called &quot;RuneScape 3&quot; and would use WebGL, and would include a fully customisable user interface and improved audio. A closed beta of the HTML5 version went live on 17 April 2013, followed by a separate alpha version of the new interface on 24 April. &quot;RuneScape 3&quot; was released on 22 July 2013.

At RuneFest 2014, Jagex announced that they were developing a new client to replace the HTML5 version, which had never been released from beta due to performance issues. The new client, named NXT, would include improvements to loading times, new graphical effects and better performance. Closed betas took place on 19–22 February and 18–21 March 2016, followed by a public release on 18 April 2016.

On 23 May 2018, it was announced that due to constantly accumulating bugs and a game engine that has become incompatible with modern support tools of the company, &quot;RuneScape Classic&quot; servers would be permanently closed on 6 August 2018. &quot;RuneScape&quot; was released on Steam on 14 October 2020.

===Graphics and audio===
&quot;RuneScape&quot; can be run with varying levels of graphical detail. High-detail graphics enhance texture and design, while low-detail graphics provide a cleaner look and can reduce lag on less powerful computers. &quot;RuneScape&quot; uses a graphics engine called &quot;RuneTek 5&quot;, which provides support for multiple graphics platforms such as DirectX, OpenGL and video game consoles, as well as graphical effects such as sky boxes, bloom lighting and Z-buffering. The high-detail version incorporates hardware acceleration and can be rendered using either Java OpenGL or DirectX.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; features a character-customisation system. Player characters are human; however, players may choose the gender, hairstyle, facial hair, skin colour, and clothing options. Appearance is further complemented by wearing or wielding items. Players can express emotions through the use of specialised animations called emotes, some of which are standard and others earned through gameplay or released during holiday events.

&quot;RuneScape&quot; has original music and ambient soundscapes. The music was designed to define the underlying cultures of the various locations accessible, and ambient sounds, such as the cry of seagulls flying over the ocean, occur in logical places. The game also incorporates voice acting in certain areas and situations. The &quot;RuneScape 3&quot; update included orchestral music recorded in Bratislava, Slovakia, and was scored by James Hannigan.

===Servers===
, there were 139 English &quot;RuneScape&quot; servers located throughout the world, which are numbered and referred to as &quot;worlds&quot; by players and by Jagex. They are located in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, Mexico, France, Lithuania, and India. Servers are moved or added as the need arises.

Each &quot;RuneScape&quot; server allows up to 2,000 players to log in simultaneously, allowing a maximum capacity of more than 278,000 players. The servers are divided into free servers which are available for all players, and servers which are reserved for paying members. Some servers are given activity labels, allowing players performing tasks that require or desire group participation to group together.
===&quot;Old School RuneScape&quot;===

In February 2013, a poll was opened allowing players to decide whether Jagex should open a separate incarnation of &quot;RuneScape&quot; from August 2007. &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot; was opened to paying subscribers on 22 February 2013 after the poll received 50,000 votes, and a free-to-play version was later released on 19 February 2015. It was originally created as an exact copy of &quot;RuneScape&quot; from August 2007 and receives regular content additions. &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot; is entirely community based; for any proposed update or idea to pass into the game, it needs at least 75% of the community to vote &#x27;Yes&#x27; for it, and if it does not pass it will either be dropped or reconstructed and re-polled so that the players may find the update more acceptable. On 17 July 2017, Jagex announced a mobile port of &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot;, which was released in 2018.

===&quot;DarkScape&quot;===
On 16 September 2015 Jagex released &quot;DarkScape&quot;, a separate version of &quot;RuneScape&quot; which featured open-world player versus player combat. &quot;DarkScape&quot; was originally released with most of &quot;RuneScape&quot;″s content, but received separate content updates. &quot;DarkScape&quot; was completely free to play, with some additional benefits reserved for paying subscribers. &quot;DarkScape&quot; closed on 28 March 2016 due to lack of interest.

==Community==
A set of forums are provided by Jagex on the &quot;RuneScape&quot; website. On the forums, players are able to participate in game discussions, arrange to buy or sell items, post suggestions for game improvements, vote in polls, and otherwise interact with the community. A user can set an avatar, have a separate display name and set an automatic signature. User profiles display the recent posts a user has made along with the option to disable smileys. The privilege of posting on the forums is limited to paying members, as well as free players with a total level exceeding 350.

Between 24 September 2002 and 9 December 2004, players could submit questions via e-mail to the &quot;RuneScape&quot; gods, which were published in the form of letters. On 26 September 2005, a new feature known as &quot;Postbag from the Hedge&quot; was introduced, where players can submit questions via e-mail to a non-player character in the game. Players can also submit original &quot;RuneScape&quot; related artwork (such as sculptures, comics, drawings and paintings), some of which is displayed in a gallery on the &quot;RuneScape&quot; website.

During various holidays, including Easter, Halloween and Christmas, Jagex hosts a holiday event in a specific location in Gielinor. Players who successfully complete the required tasks during the event receive a reward such as an item or an emote, allowing the player character to perform a gesture conveying an emotion. Holiday items released prior to 2002 are tradeable among players, and due to their rarity are worth significant amounts of money on the player market. Holiday items after Christmas 2002 are untradeable and limited to one per player and can be retrieved if lost.

Various &quot;RuneScape&quot; fansites have been established by players, which are a source of information about the game. For account security reasons, Jagex discourages the discussion of fansites within the game or the forums – and a rule specifically prohibits sharing web addresses. A major fansite has criticised Jagex for not recognising fansites&#x27; contributions to the development of its game. However, as a result of announcements made in 2009, Jagex promised to increase communication with fansites.

On 28 July 2014, Twitch functionality was integrated into the game, allowing players to stream their gameplay or view other streams from within the game.

===Rules and cheating===
Jagex has employed rules for player conduct, such as rules against offensive language, scamming, and bug abuse. To enforce the rules, an in-game feature exists that allows a player to send a report to Jagex if they notice another player breaking a rule. &quot;RuneScape&quot; also uses four types of moderators: Jagex Moderators, who are Jagex employees; Local Moderators, who are employees of Jagex&#x27;s partners in certain territories; Player Moderators, who are trusted players that enforce the rules within the game; and Forum Moderators, who are trusted players who monitor the game forums. Players who repeatedly break the rules may be temporarily or permanently banned from playing the game.

There are also rules prohibiting the use of third-party software to play the game, known as &quot;macroing&quot; or &quot;botting&quot;, and the sale of game items for real money through real-world trading. In an attempt to stop cheating, Jagex made direct interaction with the client difficult, established rules against the practice, and introduced random events that required player input to complete. In response to continued gold farming, Jagex issued a statement condemning real-world trading, stating that they were seizing billions of gold and banning thousands of accounts every week for cheating, and promising to increase their efforts to prevent real-world trading in the game.

From October 2007 to December 2007, Jagex began releasing a series of updates to restrict unbalanced trades. The updates limited the value of items staked in duels, removed player-versus-player combat from the Wilderness, made valuable player drops invisible to other players, introduced gravestones for the items of dead players, instituted systems for assisting players with skills and sharing loot among groups of players, and established the Grand Exchange, a sharemarket-like trade system for &quot;RuneScape&quot; goods. Collectively, these changes were designed to make it extremely difficult for real-world traders to distribute gold and items to players. These features were restored on 1 February 2011 following a referendum among players in December 2010 on whether or not to do so.

On 25 October 2011, Jagex released an anti-bot system code-named the &#x27;ClusterFlutterer&#x27;, as part of a game update intended to permanently prevent &quot;reflection&quot; bots from working. The release of this was nicknamed the &quot;Bot Nuke&quot;, and was estimated to have banned 98% of the accounts that were using bots, eventually resulting in 7.7 million account bans. From 26 September 2012 until its removal on 20 August 2018, accounts that were banned for using bots were sent to an isolated area named &quot;Botany Bay&quot; to be given an ultimate punishment as decided by players.

On 25 September 2013, Jagex introduced bonds to the game, in-game items that can be purchased using real currency then traded with other players or exchanged for membership, RuneCoins or additional spins on the game&#x27;s Squeal of Fortune. Bonds were introduced to allow players to exchange real currency for in-game benefits legitimately, a move described by CEO Mark Gerhard as &quot;essential for the future of &quot;RuneScape&quot;&quot;. One week later, Jagex reported that the amount of in-game coins brought in by gold farmers was down by 81%; real-world trading was down by 61% and the wealth of those trades was down by 63%.

===Falador Massacre===
The Falador Massacre was a historic bug that occurred on 6 June 2006. The bug caused several players to retain the ability to attack other players after leaving a designated PvP location. Ordinarily, players are only allowed to attack other players in player-owned houses, minigames, or in the Wilderness. According to a statement made by a Jagex employee, the bug was caused by insufficient testing of an update that saw the release of a new game skill, Construction, wherein players could create their own houses in which PvP combat could take place.

Although the bug was considered quite negative at the time of occurrence, Jagex has since recognized it as a historic event in the franchise, and has created in-game reenactments in both &quot;RuneScape&quot; and &quot;Old School RuneScape&quot;. On 6 June 2016, Jagex created two unique and isolated game servers (worlds 111 for RS3 and 666 for OSRS, commemorating 6/6/06) wherein PvP was enabled and players could attack an NPC named after &quot;Durial321&quot;, one of the more well known players to have been affected by the bug. World 666 also played an in-game cover of the song &quot;Planet Hell&quot; by Nightwish, which was the song used in the original video of the event. The track was removed from the game when the event was over. The bug&#x27;s reception has become part of internet culture. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; called the bug &quot;One of the best all-time MMO bugs&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; stated in December 2003, that while the &quot;traditional [role-playing game] values of questing, slaying monsters and developing your character in a familiar medieval setting&quot; will not &quot;have the big boys trembling in their +2 Boots of Subscriber Gathering,&quot; this is offset by the game&#x27;s accessibility through a web browser, &quot;compounded by a version of the game that allows free adventuring player the opportunity to upgrade to a members&#x27; account&quot;, describing the game as &quot;an unsurprising success&quot;.

The Yahoo! 2006 Buzz Log stated that, &quot;while it may not be as easy on the eyes as some other popular [MMORPGs], like &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, or &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;RuneScape&quot; is still a lot better way to kill time than pushing around cells in a spreadsheet&quot;. A 2007 JustRPG review summarised &quot;RuneScape&quot; as &quot;a fun, addictive game, and while the graphics may not be perfect, for a game written in Java, they aren&#x27;t bad. The skills are varied, the community is alright, and it&#x27;ll eat up your time if you aren&#x27;t careful&quot;, giving it a score of 83%.

In its 2008 intellectual property profile of the game, Developmag.com stated that whilst Jagex&#x27;s changes to curtail real world trading resulted in &quot;a wave of user criticism... growth is understood to have resumed since&quot;. Its analysis stated that &quot;&quot;RuneScape&quot;″s mass-market appeal lies in its simplicity and accessibility (both financial and technical). It has tapped into the vast market of games players unwilling or unable to spend premium prices on PCs capable of playing the latest, expensive, processor-intensive games. Its core gameplay concepts are very similar to its retail-distributed RPG and MMORPG analogues.&quot; In August 2008, &quot;RuneScape&quot; was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the world&#x27;s most popular free MMORPG. Jagex was presented with a certificate to commemorate the achievement at the 2008 Leipzig Games Convention. A 2009 Eurogamer article criticised &quot;RuneScape&quot;″s in-game community for being unfriendly to newcomers, although they have stated that the fan-forum community is more approachable.

An April 2011 review by MMORPG.com was complimentary of &quot;RuneScape&quot;, stating that &quot;For anyone looking for that &quot;old-school&quot; experience but with also tons of progression, refinement, and unique ideas, RuneScape is easily recommendable&quot;, but criticised the game&#x27;s combat system and emphasis on grinding. &quot;...the genre feels slightly passed clicking an enemy and watching two swords clunk mercilessly into opposing body forms...&quot;RuneScape&quot; has grind in abundance and while this is not entirely a bad thing, it will put some players off looking for a slightly easier and more casual experience&quot;. The game received the &quot;Role-Playing Game&quot; award at The Independent Game Developers&#x27; Association Awards 2018.

On 10 December 2007, updates by Jagex removed free player-versus-player combat and unbalanced trading in order to rid the game of activities involving real currency being traded for virtual goods. The updates also affected legitimate players, resulting in many of them actively complaining on the forums. Jagex issued a Customer Support News article admitting the updates may not have been an ideal replacement for what was removed, requesting patience and promising to remedy potential problems with updates in the future. During the changes, subscription numbers fell by 60,000. No figures were given as to how many of those subscriptions belonged to legitimate players and how many to gold farmers. In an interview in February 2008, Jagex&#x27;s head of content stated that, &quot;we were really afraid we were going to lose our members over this change, because other games had in the past. But we are very, very pleased to say that we have lost practically none of our members.&quot;

In December 2010, a referendum was opened to decide whether to restore unbalanced trades and player-versus-player combat in the Wilderness, which closed with 1.2 million votes cast and 91% of voters in favour of the proposal, and these features were restored on 1 February 2011. A second referendum was announced in February 2013 to decide whether to run a separate version of the game dating from 2007, closing on 1 March 2013 with almost 450,000 votes. Servers for the 2007 version were opened on 22 February 2013 once 50,000 votes were collected.

===Revenue===
In 2018, it was reported that &quot;RuneScape&quot; had generated over US$1 billion in lifetime revenue since its original launch. &quot;RuneScape&quot; annually generates over £100 million in revenue and over £50 million in profit.

<doc id="251218" wikidata="Q3396578" url="?curid=251218" title="List of the busiest airports">
<text>The definition of world&#x27;s busiest airport has been specified by the Airports Council International in Montreal, Canada. The ACI defines and measures the following three types of airport traffic:
*Passenger traffic: total passengers embarked and disembarked, passengers in transit counted once
*Cargo traffic: loaded and unloaded freight and mail, by mass
*Traffic movements: landings and take-offs of aircraft

==Busiest airports==

The following airports make claims based on objective volume measures that are defined above (as per ACI):

*Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia, United States
:Most passengers annually (1998–2019, 2021–present)
:Most aircraft movements annually (2015–present)

*Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China
:Most passengers annually (2020)

*Dubai International Airport, Dubai, United Arab Emirates
:Most international passengers annually (2014–present)

*Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee, United States
:Most cargo traffic by weight annually (2020–2021)

*Hong Kong International Airport, New Territories, Hong Kong. 
:Most cargo traffic by weight annually (2022–present)

== Busiest airport by region ==
Below are the busiest airports for each continent by passenger traffic:
* Africa - Cairo International Airport, Egypt
* Asia - Dubai International Airport, United Arab Emirates
* Europe - Heathrow Airport, London, United Kingdom
* North America - Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Georgia, United States
* Oceania - Sydney Airport, Australia
* South America - El Dorado International Airport, Bogotá, Colombia

== Busiest city destination ==
*Airports of London combined, London, United Kingdom
:Most passengers annually in all city airports combined (2010–present)

==Historical claims==
*Midway International Airport, Chicago, Illinois, United States
:In the late 1940s, Chicago Midway was the busiest airport in the United States by total aircraft operations – i.e., including every training aircraft practicing take-offs and landings. New York LaGuardia had the most airline operations and passengers until the early 1950s, when Chicago Midway became the busiest airport in the United States by any criterion. Before World War II, Chicago Midway was the origin or destination of one in four U.S. airline flights, although a 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows more airline flights scheduled at Newark than at Chicago.

*Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee, United States
:As the home of FedEx Express, Memphis had the largest cargo operations worldwide from 1993 to 2009. It remains the busiest cargo airport in the United States and the Western Hemisphere.

<doc id="251220" wikidata="Q193009" url="?curid=251220" title="Frank B. Kellogg">
<text>Frank Billings Kellogg (December 22, 1856 – December 21, 1937) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served in the U.S. Senate and as U.S. Secretary of State. He co-authored the Kellogg–Briand Pact, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1929.

== Early life and career ==
Kellogg was born in Potsdam, New York, on December 22, 1856, the son of Abigail (Billings) and Asa Farnsworth Kellogg. His family moved to Minnesota in 1865.

Kellogg read law and began practicing law in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1877. He served as city attorney of Rochester 1878–1881 and county attorney for Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1882 to 1887. He moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1886.

In 1905, Kellogg joined the federal government when Theodore Roosevelt asked Kellogg to prosecute a federal antitrust case. In 1906, Kellogg was appointed special counsel to the Interstate Commerce Commission for its investigation of E. H. Harriman. In 1908, he was appointed to lead the federal prosecution against Union Pacific Railroad, under the Sherman Antitrust Act. His most important case was &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot;, 221 U.S. 1 (1911). Following this successful prosecution, he was elected president of the American Bar Association (1912–1913). He was a member of the World War Foreign Debts Commission.

In 1907, Kellogg was honored as a Compatriot of the Minnesota Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.

===United States Senate===
In 1916, Kellogg was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate from Minnesota and served from March 4, 1917, to March 3, 1923, in the 65th, 66th, and 67th Congresses. During the ratification battle for the Treaty of Versailles, he was one of the few Republicans who supported ratification. He lost his re-election bid in 1922 and, in 1923, he was a delegate to the Fifth International Conference of American States at Santiago, Chile.

===Ambassador to Great Britain===

In 1924, he was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Great Britain, serving from January 14, 1924, to February 10, 1925. He succeeded George Brinton McClellan Harvey who served under Warren G. Harding and was succeeded by Alanson B. Houghton so that Kellogg could assume the role of Secretary of State.

==Secretary of State==
From 1925 to 1929, he served as the United States Secretary of State in the Cabinet of President Coolidge. In 1928, he was awarded the Freedom of the City in Dublin, Ireland and in 1929 the government of France made him a member of the Legion of Honour.

As Secretary of State, he was responsible for improving U.S.–Mexican relations and helping to resolve the long-standing Tacna–Arica controversy between Peru and Chile. His most significant accomplishment, however, was the Kellogg–Briand Pact, signed in 1928. Proposed by its other namesake, French foreign minister Aristide Briand, the treaty intended to provide for &quot;the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.&quot; Kellogg was awarded the 1929 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition. (Briand had already won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1926).

He was associate judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice from 1930 to 1935.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1931.

Kellogg was self-conscious about his lack of academic credentials; he attended a one-room country school and dropped out at age 14. He never attended high school, college or law school. His only advanced training came from clerking in a private lawyer&#x27;s office. Kellogg grew up in a poor farm in Minnesota, and lacked a commanding presence or the sophistication to deal with the aristocrats who dominated European diplomacy. As Secretary of State, his main focus was Latin America, where he dealt with brutal but unsophisticated strongmen. His staff provided the ideas, and they appreciated that he was always open, candid, and easy to communicate with. He helped end the battle between the Mexican government and the Catholic Church, but failed to resolve the dispute over ownership of the oil reserves. In the Far East, he followed the advice of Nelson Trusler Johnson, the new chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs. They favored China and protected it from threats from Japan. They successfully negotiated tariff reform with China, thereby giving enhanced status to the Kuomintang and helping get rid of the unequal treaties. As for Europe he was primarily interested with expanding the limitations on naval armaments that been established by the Washington Treaty; he made little progress. Kellogg gained international fame, and the Nobel Peace Prize, with the Kellogg–Briand Pact. It was endorsed by nearly every nation and made starting a war a punishable criminal action. It formed the legal basis for the trial and execution of German and Japanese war leaders after 1945.

==Personal life==
In 1886, Kellogg married Clara May Cook (1861–1942), the daughter of George Clinton Cook (1828–1901) and Elizabeth (née Burns) Cook (1838–1908).

In 1880, he became a member of the Masonic Lodge Rochester No. 21, where he received the degrees of freemasonry on April 1, April 19, and May 3.

He died from pneumonia, following a stroke, on the eve of his 81st birthday in St. Paul. He was buried at the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea in Washington National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.

===Legacy===
In 1937, he endowed the Kellogg Foundation for Education in International Relations at Carleton College, where he was a trustee. His house in St. Paul, the Frank B. Kellogg House was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1976.

The following were named in his honor:

* Kellogg Boulevard in downtown Saint Paul.

<text>Barbara Dennerlein (born 25 September 1964 in Munich) is a German jazz organist. She has achieved critical acclaim for using the bass pedalboard on a Hammond organ and for integrating synthesizer sounds onto the instrument, and was described by critic Ron Wynn as &quot;the most interesting jazz organist to emerge during the 1980s&quot;.

==Career==
===Early years===
Dennerlein was born and grew up in Munich, Germany. She began playing the organ aged 11 after receiving a small Hohner instrument for Christmas. She was encouraged by her grandfather to learn a musical instrument, and her parents were both jazz enthusiasts. She took formal lessons for two years under the instruction of Paul Greisl, who had a Hammond B-3. She immediately became interested in the instrument and that it contained a bass pedalboard, unlike her Hohner. After some searching, since the instrument was then out of production, she acquired her own Hammond aged 13 from her parents.

She began to play concerts aged 14, and the following year, she played in a jazz club for the first time. When leading her own bands, Dennerlein was often the youngest musician in the group, and she learned to co-operate with more experienced musicians. Her local reputation as the &quot;Organ Tornado from Munich&quot; spread after her first television appearances in 1982.

===Recordings===
When her third LP &quot;Bebab&quot; was issued, Dennerlein established her own record label in 1985 and assumed her own management duties, because she felt she did not have enough support from her existing label or from Hammond, who wanted to promote later digital models rather than the B-3 she used. She received two German Record Critics&#x27; awards for self-produced albums. Later, she made three recordings for Enja Records and three for Verve Records. On these recordings she worked with Ray Anderson, Randy Brecker, Dennis Chambers, Roy Hargrove, Mitch Watkins, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts.

===Instruments===
Dennerlein modified a Hammond&#x27;s pedalboard to trigger samples of an acoustic bass and, impressed with results, decided to modify the manuals to play samplers too. Her performances include solo performances, as well as quintets (e.g. her &quot;Bebab&quot; band). In both, she uses MIDI technology and triggers built into pedals and manuals to trigger synthesizers and samples.

After a variety of projects and after playing with unconventional musicians, such as Friedrich Gulda, Dennerlein started playing the pipe organ in 1994. Since 2003, she has also developed jazz projects with symphonic orchestras, including a collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on the Karl Schuke organ.

===Compositions===
Dennerlein claims to have been primarily influenced by jazz and was not initially interested in classical or church music, although it was and is popular in Germany. She has never been enthusiastic about formal music theory, preferring to learn things through improvisation. However, she has further said that her main influence from jazz is the ability to mix other musical styles as desired, saying &quot;To me, jazz is a synonym for freedom. Freedom from prejudice and discrimination&quot;.

Dennerlein&#x27;s first album included four of her own pieces. Her compositions vary from traditional blues schemes, romantic, melancholic ballads to tempo-driven compositions with elements of swing, bebop, funk and Latin rhythms. The fast tempos and rhythmic figures she uses in her interpretations of well-known standards, and in many of her own compositions, require fast bass pedalboard footwork, though she has used bass players for recordings in order to feature techniques such as slap bass, which cannot be played on pedals. Dennerlein often uses changing meter (e.g., 3/4 to 4/4), as well as unconventional harmonic changes to add expression to her compositions.

<text>John Toland (30 November 167011 March 1722) was an Irish rationalist philosopher and freethinker, and occasional satirist, who wrote numerous books and pamphlets on political philosophy and philosophy of religion, which are early expressions of the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment. Born in Ireland, he was educated at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Leiden and Oxford and was influenced by the philosophy of John Locke.

His first, and best known work, &quot;Christianity Not Mysterious&quot; (1696), opposed hierarchy in both church and state. In Ireland, copies were burned by the public hangman, and he was forced to flee the country never to return.

==Biography==
Very little is known of Toland&#x27;s early life. He was born in Ardagh on the Inishowen Peninsula, a predominantly Catholic and Irish-speaking region in northwestern Ireland. His parents are unknown. He would later write that he had been baptised &quot;Janus Junius&quot;, a play on his name that recalled both the Roman two-faced god Janus and Junius Brutus, reputed founder of the Roman Republic. According to his biographer Pierre des Maizeaux, he adopted the name John as a schoolboy with the encouragement of his school teacher.

Having formally converted from Catholicism to Protestantism at the age of 16, Toland got a scholarship to study theology at the University of Glasgow. In 1690, at age 19, the University of Edinburgh conferred a master&#x27;s degree on him. He then got a scholarship to spend two years studying at University of Leiden in Holland, and subsequently nearly two years at Oxford in England (1694–95), where he acquired a reputation for great learning and &quot;little religion.&quot; The Leiden scholarship had been provided by wealthy English Dissenters, who hoped Toland would go on to become a minister for Dissenters.

In Toland&#x27;s first book &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot; (1696), begun at Oxford, he argued that the divine revelation of the Bible contains no true mysteries; rather, all the dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly trained reason from natural principles. His argument immediately attracted several rebuttals, and he was prosecuted by a grand jury in London. As he was a subject of the Kingdom of Ireland, members of the Parliament of Ireland proposed that he should be burnt at the stake, and in his absence—curtailing a visit in 1697, he fled the country—16 three copies of the book were burnt by the public hangman in Dublin as the content was contrary to the core doctrines of the Church of Ireland. Toland bitterly compared the Protestant legislators to &quot;Popish Inquisitors who performed that Execution on the Book, when they could not seize the Author, whom they had destined to the Flames&quot;.

After his departure from Oxford Toland resided in London for most of the rest of his life, but was also a somewhat frequent visitor to the European continent, particularly Germany and the Netherlands. He lived on the Continent from 1707 to 1710. Toland died in Putney on 10 March 1722. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911) says of him that at his death in London at age 51 &quot;he died... as he had lived, in great poverty, in the midst of his books, with his pen in his hand.&quot; Just before he died, he composed his own epitaph, part of which reads: &quot;He was an assertor of liberty, a lover of all sorts of learning ... but no man&#x27;s follower or dependent. Nor could frowns or fortune bend him to decline from the ways he had chosen.&quot; Although he himself had written biographies in his career, it concludes, tellingly: &quot;If you would know more of him, search his writings.&quot;

Very shortly after his death a lengthy biography of Toland was written by Pierre des Maizeaux.

==Political thought==

John Toland was the first person called a freethinker (by Bishop Berkeley) and went on to write over a hundred books in various domains but mostly dedicated to criticising ecclesiastical institutions. A great deal of his intellectual activity was dedicated to writing political tracts in support of the Whig cause. Many scholars know him for his role as either the biographer or editor of notable republicans from the mid-17th century such as James Harrington, Algernon Sidney and John Milton. His works &quot;Anglia Libera&quot; and &quot;State Anatomy&quot; are prosaic expressions of an English republicanism which reconciles itself with constitutional monarchy. During a brief visit to Hanover in 1701, he was received by the electress Sophia, as &quot;Anglia Libera&quot; contained a defence of the Hanoverian succession.
After &quot;Christianity Not Mysterious&quot;, Toland&#x27;s views became gradually more radical. His opposition to hierarchy in the church also led to opposition to hierarchy in the state; bishops and kings, in other words, were as bad as each other, and monarchy had no God-given sanction as a form of government. In his 1704 &quot;Letters to Serena&quot;—in which he used the expression &quot;pantheism&quot;—he carefully analysed the manner by which truth is arrived at, and why people are prone to forms of &quot;false consciousness.&quot;

In politics his most radical proposition was that liberty was a defining characteristic of what it means to be human. Political institutions should be designed to guarantee freedom, not simply to establish order. For Toland, reason and tolerance were the twin pillars of the good society. This was Whiggism at its most intellectually refined, the very antithesis of the Tory belief in sacred authority in both church and state. Toland&#x27;s belief in the need for perfect equality among free-born citizens was extended to the Jewish community, tolerated, but still outsiders in early 18th century England. In his 1714 work &quot;Reasons for Naturalising the Jews&quot;, he called for naturalizing foreign-born Jews and allowing them to hold public office. The work borrowed from Simone Luzzatto&#x27;s 1638 &quot;Discourse on the Jews of Venice&quot;.

Toland&#x27;s world was not all detached intellectual speculation, however. There was also an incendiary element to his political pamphleteering, and he was not beyond appealing to some of the baser anti-Catholic sentiments of the day in his attacks on the Jacobites.

===Literary Hoax &quot;The Treatise of the Three Imposters&quot;===
He also produced some highly controversial polemics, rumors including the &quot;Treatise of the Three Impostors&quot;, in which Christianity, Judaism and Islam are all condemned as the three great political frauds. The &quot;Treatise of the Three Imposters&quot; was rumoured to exist in manuscript form since the Middle Ages and excoriated throughout all of Europe. It is now thought that the work did not exist.

Toland claimed to have a personal copy of the manuscript which he passed to the circle of Jean Rousset in France. Rumours that it was then translated into French were taken seriously by some: however, not by Voltaire, who issued a satirical reply.

===Editions of republican radicals of the 1650s===
His republican sympathies were also evidenced by his editing of the writings of some of the great radicals of the 1650s, including James Harrington, Algernon Sydney, Edmund Ludlow and John Milton. In his support for the Hanoverian monarchy he somewhat moderated his republican sentiments; though his ideal kingship was one that would work towards achieving civic virtue and social harmony, a &#x27;just liberty&#x27; and the &#x27;preservation and improvement of our reason.&#x27; But George I and the oligarchy behind Walpole were about as far from Toland&#x27;s ideal as it is possible to get.

==Contributions to natural philosophy==
Toland influenced Baron d&#x27;Holbach&#x27;s ideas about physical motion. In his &quot;Letters to Serena&quot;, Toland claimed that rest, or absence of motion, is not merely relative. Actually, for Toland, rest is a special case of motion. When there is a conflict of forces, the body that is apparently at rest is influenced by as much activity and passivity as it would be if it were moving.

==Religious thought==

The resemblance, both in title and in principles, of &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot; to Locke&#x27;s 1695 &quot;Reasonableness of Christianity&quot;, led to a prompt disavowal on Locke&#x27;s part of the supposed identity of opinions, and subsequently to the controversy between Edward Stillingfleet and Locke. Toland&#x27;s next work of importance, the &quot;Life of Milton&quot; (1698) referred to &quot;the numerous supposititious pieces under the name of Christ and His apostles and other great persons,&quot; provoked the charge that he had called in question the genuineness of the New Testament writings. Toland replied in his &quot;Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton&#x27;s Life&quot; (1699), to which he added a remarkable list of what are now called New Testament apocrypha. In his remarks he really opened up the great question of the history of the Biblical canon.

Toland identified himself as a pantheist in his publication &quot;Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist&quot; in 1705. At the time when he wrote &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot; he was careful to distinguish himself from both sceptical atheists and orthodox theologians. After having formulated a stricter version of Locke&#x27;s epistemological rationalism, Toland then goes on to show that there are no facts or doctrines from the Bible which are not perfectly plain, intelligible and reasonable, being neither contrary to reason nor incomprehensible to it. All revelation is human revelation; that which is not rendered understandable is to be rejected as gibberish.

However, David Berman has argued for an atheistic reading of Toland, demonstrating contradictions between &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot; and Toland&#x27;s &quot;Two Essays&quot; (London, 1695). Berman&#x27;s reading of Toland and Charles Blount attempts to show that Toland deliberately obscured his real atheism so as to avoid prosecution whilst attempting to subliminally influence unknowing readers, specifically by creating contradictions in his work which can only be resolved by reducing Toland&#x27;s God to a pantheistic one, and realising that such a non-providential God is, for Blount, Toland and Colins, &quot;...no God, or as good as no God...In short, the God of theism is &quot;blictri&quot; for Toland; only the determined material God of pantheism exists, and he (or it) is really no God.&quot;

After his &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot;, Toland&#x27;s &quot;Letters to Serena&quot; constitute his major contribution to philosophy. In the first three letters, he develops a historical account of the rise of superstition arguing that human reason cannot ever fully liberate itself from prejudices. In the last two letters, he founds a metaphysical materialism grounded in a critique of monist substantialism. Later on, we find Toland continuing his critique of church government in &quot;Nazarenus&quot; which was first more fully developed in his &quot;Primitive Constitution of the Christian Church&quot;, a clandestine writing in circulation by 1705. The first book of &quot;Nazarenus&quot; calls attention to the right of the Ebionites to a place in the early church. The thrust of his argument was to push to the very limits the applicability of canonical scripture to establish institutionalised religion. Later works of special importance include Tetradymus wherein can be found Clidophorus, a historical study of the distinction between esoteric and exoteric philosophies.

His &quot;Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae&quot; (Pantheisticon, or the Form of Celebrating the Socratic Society), of which he printed a few copies for private circulation only, gave great offence as a sort of liturgic service made up of passages from pagan authors, in imitation of the Church of England liturgy. The title also was in those days alarming, and still more so the mystery which the author threw around the question how far such societies of pantheists actually existed. The term &quot;pantheism&quot; was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of Spinoza.

Toland was famous for distinguishing exoteric philosophy—what one says publicly about religion—from esoteric philosophy—what one confides to trusted friends. In 2007 Fouke&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy and Theology in a Burlesque Mode: John Toland and the Way of Paradox&quot; presented an analysis of Toland&#x27;s &#x27;exoteric strategy&#x27; of speaking as others speak, but with a different meaning. He argues that Toland&#x27;s philosophy and theology had little to do with positive expression of beliefs, and that his philosophical aim was not to develop an epistemology, a true metaphysical system, an ideal form of governance, or the basis of ethical obligation, but to find ways to participate in the discourses of others while undermining those discourses from within. Fouke traces Toland&#x27;s practices to Shaftesbury&#x27;s conception of a comic or &#x27;derisory&#x27; mode of philosophising aimed at exposing pedantry, imposture, dogmatism, and folly.

==Influence and legacy==
Toland was a man not of his time; one who advocated principles of virtue in duty, principles that had little place in the England of Robert Walpole, governed by cynicism and self-interest. His intellectual reputation, moreover, was subsequently eclipsed by the likes of John Locke and David Hume, and still more by Montesquieu and the French radical thinkers. Edmund Burke in his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; wrote dismissively of Toland and his fellows: &quot;Who, born within the last 40 years, has read one word of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers?&quot;

Still, in &quot;Christianity not Mysterious&quot;, the book for which he is best known, Toland laid down a challenge not just to the authority of the established church, but to all inherited and unquestioned authority. It was thus as radical politically and philosophically, as it was theologically.

Of his influence, humanities professor Robert Pattison wrote: &quot;Two centuries earlier the establishment would have burned him as a heretic; two centuries later it would have made him a professor of comparative religion in a California university. In the rational Protestant climate of early 18th-century Britain, he was merely ignored to death.&quot;

However, Toland managed to find success after his death: Thomas Hollis, the great 18th century book collector and editor, commissioned the London bookseller Andrew Millar to publish works advocating republican government – a list of titles which included Toland&#x27;s work in 1760.

<text>The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah&#x27;s Kingdom is an illustrated religious magazine, published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses distribute &quot;The Watchtower—Public Edition&quot;, along with its companion magazine, &quot;Awake!&quot;.

The Watch Tower Society reports a circulation of 21.7 million per issue for &quot;The Watchtower—Public Edition&quot; in 444 languages, with one new issue produced annually. &quot;The Watchtower—Study Edition&quot;, used at congregation meetings, is published monthly.
== History ==

The magazine was started by Charles Taze Russell in July 1879 under the title Zion&#x27;s Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence. According to its first issue, the magazine&#x27;s original purpose was to draw attention to Russell&#x27;s belief that people of the time were &quot;living &#x27;in the last days&#x27; &#x27;the day of the Lord&#x27;—&#x27;the end&#x27; of the Gospel age,&quot; and that &quot;the dawn of the &#x27;new&#x27; age, are facts not only discernible by the close student of the Word, led by the spirit, but the outward signs recognizable by the world bear the same testimony.&quot;

In 1909 the name was changed to &quot;The Watch Tower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;. In 1920, the Watch Tower Society reprinted all issues from 1879–1919 in seven volumes, known as the &quot;Watchtower Reprints&quot;, which have since been reprinted by various Bible Student groups. On October 15, 1931, the magazine was renamed &quot;The Watchtower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Presence&quot;; on January 1, 1939, &quot;The Watchtower and Herald of Christ&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;; from March 1, 1939 until the present, its full name has been &quot;The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;.

== Content ==
Articles are submitted by writing committees from worldwide branch offices, which are then checked by editors and translated into the languages of publication; all involved are volunteers. Women are permitted to write articles that are not of a doctrinal nature. The names of the authors (except in first-person life stories), and other publishing staff are not provided. &quot;The Watchtower&quot; is overseen by the Writing Committee of the Governing Body of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

&quot;The Watchtower&quot; is the official means of sharing Jehovah&#x27;s Witness beliefs, and includes articles relating to biblical prophecies, Christian conduct and morals, and the history of religion and the Bible. It is intended to draw attention to the kingdom of God, which Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe is a real government that will soon replace all earthly governments. According to the magazine&#x27;s mission statement:

THIS MAGAZINE, The Watchtower, honors Jehovah God, the Ruler of the universe. It comforts people with the good news that God&#x27;s heavenly Kingdom will soon end all wickedness and transform the earth into a paradise. It promotes faith in Jesus Christ, who died so that we might gain everlasting life and who is now ruling as King of God&#x27;s Kingdom. This magazine has been published continuously since 1879 and is nonpolitical. It adheres to the Bible as its authority.

Previously, each issue of the &quot;Watchtower&quot; contained study articles and other regular features and was distributed to the general public. In 2008, content was divided into a &quot;Public Edition&quot; distributed to non-Witnesses and a &quot;Study Edition&quot;, which contains &quot;pointed information prepared especially for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&quot;.

===&quot;Public Edition&quot;===
The &quot;Public Edition&quot; of &quot;The Watchtower&quot; contains biblical articles relating to a theme shown on the cover. In January 2013, &quot;The Watchtower—Public Edition&quot; was reduced from 32 to 16 pages, with greater focus on the official Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses website. Initially issued monthly, as of January 2016 the &quot;Public Edition&quot; was published every two months, and was further reduced to three issues per year as of January 2018. In 2022, publication was reduced to one new issue per year.

===&quot;Study Edition&quot;===
The &quot;Study Edition&quot; contains study articles written for the &quot;Watchtower&quot; Study, as well as other intra-organizational information directed to current and prospective members.

Congregations of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses worldwide discuss the same article each week at the &quot;Watchtower&quot; Study. At this meeting, each paragraph is read aloud by a designated reader; the study conductor then asks questions printed at the bottom of the page for each paragraph and calls on members of the congregation to answer the questions based on the printed information. They are encouraged to put the information in their own words and to &quot;draw attention to scripture application, supporting arguments, or practical application of the material.&quot;

A separate &quot;Simplified&quot; version of the &quot;Study Edition&quot; was introduced in July 2011 but was discontinued in 2019.

== Distribution ==
The magazine is printed in nineteen countries. each issue of the &quot;Public Edition&quot; has an average circulation of 21.7 million copies in 444 languages. The monthly production of the &quot;Study Edition&quot; is not stated in the English edition; in January 2018 the Russian edition stated a circulation of 13.8 million. The &quot;Study Edition&quot; is published in 463 languages.

The &quot;Public Edition&quot; is distributed by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in the course of their public ministry including door-to-door canvassing, approaching people in public places, given informally to acquaintances and professionals, or left as reading material in waiting areas. The &quot;Study Edition&quot; is generally distributed only to members but is made available to members of the public attending the study of &quot;The Watchtower&quot; at congregation meetings.

The magazine has been made available in various accessible formats. Selected articles were provided in Braille since 1960 with the full magazine available in 1979. It has also been made available in various audio formats since 1998. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; official website provides content from &quot;The Watchtower&quot; in various digital formats.
===Cost===

Until March 1990, &quot;The Watchtower&quot; was available for a small charge that varied over time and in different countries. For example, in the United States, the suggested donation per issue was $0.05 in 1950, gradually increasing to $0.25 in 1989. On January 17, 1990, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Jimmy Swaggart that sales of religious literature were subject to taxation, which introduced ambiguity into the formerly tax-free practice of suggesting a specific amount in exchange for the magazines. The Watch Tower Society supported Swaggart in the case, arguing that the perceived sale of religious literature should be exempt from taxation.

From March 1, 1990, the magazines were made available at no cost, on a freewill donation basis in the United States, with the stated purpose of simplifying their Bible educational work and distinguishing themselves from those who commercialize religion. An article in the May 1990 issue of &quot;Our Kingdom Ministry&quot;—a newsletter provided to members—stated that &quot;there are growing pressures against all religious elements&quot; and went on to say that their main concern was to move ahead in the worldwide preaching work, &quot;without hindrance.&quot;

The sale of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; literature was gradually phased out in other countries, and &quot;The Watchtower&quot; has been distributed free of charge worldwide since January 2000, its printing being funded by voluntary donations from Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and members of the public.
