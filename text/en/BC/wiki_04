<text>Bernadette Soubirous (; ; ; 7 January 184416 April 1879), also known as Bernadette of Lourdes (in religion Sister Marie-Bernard), was a miller&#x27;s daughter from Lourdes ( in Occitan), in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées in France, and is best known for experiencing apparitions of a &quot;young lady&quot; who asked for a chapel to be built at the nearby cave-grotto. These apparitions occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the young lady who appeared to her identified herself as the &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot;.

After a canonical investigation, Soubirous&#x27;s reports were eventually declared &quot;worthy of belief&quot; on 18 February 1862, and the Marian apparition became known as Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1866, Soubirous joined the Sisters of Charity of Nevers at their convent in Nevers where she spent the last years of her life. Her body is said by the Catholic Church to remain internally incorrupt. The grotto where the apparitions occurred later went on to become a major pilgrimage site and Marian shrine known as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, attracting around five million pilgrims of all denominations each year.

Pope Pius XI beatified Bernadette Soubirous on 14 June 1925 and canonized her on 8 December 1933. Her feast day, initially specified as 18 February – the day Mary promised to make her happy, not in this life, but in the other – is now observed in most places on the date of her death, 16 April.

== Early life ==
Marie-Bernarde Soubirous, nick-named Bernadette in patois, was the daughter of François Soubirous (1807–1871), a miller, and his wife Louise (née Casteròt; 1825–1866), a miller&#x27;s daughter. She was the eldest of nine children, Jean (born and died 1845), Marie, known as Toinette (1846–1892), Jean-Marie (1848–1851), Jean-Marie (1851–1919), Justin (1855–1865), Pierre (1859–1931), Jean (born and died 1864), and a baby named Louise who died soon after her birth (1866).

Soubirous was born on 7 January 1844 and baptized at the local parish church, St. Pierre&#x27;s, on 9 January, her parents&#x27; wedding anniversary. Her godmother was Bernarde Casterot, her mother&#x27;s sister, a moderately wealthy widow who owned a tavern. Hard times had fallen on France, and the family lived in extreme poverty. Soubirous was a very sick child and possibly due to this only measured 1.4 m (4 ft. 7in.) tall. She contracted cholera as a toddler and suffered severe asthma for the rest of her life. Soubirous attended the day school conducted by the Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction of Nevers. Contrary to a belief popularized by Hollywood films, Soubirous learned very little French, only studying French in school after age 13. At that time she could read and write very little due to her frequent illness. She spoke the language of Occitan, which was spoken by the local population of the Pyrenees region at that time and to a residual degree today.

== Visions ==

By the time of the events at the grotto, the Soubirous family&#x27;s financial and social status had declined to the point where they lived in a one-room basement, an abandoned jail, called &quot;le cachot&quot;, &quot;the dungeon&quot;, where they were housed for free by her mother&#x27;s cousin, André Sajoux.

On 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend near the grotto of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed behind, looking for a place to cross where she wouldn&#x27;t get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, &quot;came a dazzling light, and a white figure&quot;. This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as &quot;aquerò&quot; (pronounced ), Gascon Occitan for &quot;that&quot;. In later testimony, she called it &quot;a small young lady&quot; (&quot;uo petito damizelo&quot;). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.
On 14 February, after Sunday Mass, Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately, saying she saw the apparition again. When one of the girls threw holy water at the niche and another threw a rock from above that shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared. On her next visit, 18 February, Soubirous said that &quot;the vision&quot; asked her to return to the grotto every day for a fortnight.

This period of almost daily visions came to be known as &quot;la Quinzaine sacrée&quot;, &quot;holy fortnight.&quot; Initially, Soubirous&#x27;s parents, especially her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed she was telling the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Soubirous never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word &quot;aquerò&quot;. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot – compatible with &quot;a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church&quot;.

Soubirous&#x27;s story caused a sensation among the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not she was telling the truth. Some believed her to have a mental illness and demanded she be put in an asylum.

The other contents of Soubirous&#x27;s reported visions were simple and focused on the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her &quot;to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there,&quot; as an act of penance. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed. On 2 March, at the thirteenth apparition, Soubirous told her family that the lady said that &quot;a chapel should be built and a procession formed&quot;.

The sixteenth vision, which Soubirous stated went on for over an hour, was on 25 March. According to her account, during that visitation, she again asked the woman for her name but the lady just smiled back. She repeated the question three more times and finally heard the lady say, in Gascon Occitan, &quot;I am the Immaculate Conception&quot; (&quot;Que soy era immaculada councepciou&quot; in Occitan). Despite being rigorously interviewed by officials of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.

On 7 April, Soubirous had another vision, during which her hand was apparently not burnt while being in contact with the flame of a candle for several minutes. On 8 June 1858, the mayor of Lourdes decided to barricade the grotto and put guards to prevent public access. On 16 July, Soubirous came back to see the grotto from the other side of the river and experienced her eighteenth and last apparition of the lady.

=== Description of the vision ===
As happened later with the 1917 apparitions of Fatima in Portugal, the primordial description of the entity made by Bernadette Soubirous was gradually modified to fit the more familiar Marian iconography images. In the seer&#x27;s account, the apparition was a small figure, a young girl (a &quot;jeune fille&quot;), who looked like a twelve years old child, who was later transformed by interpreters into a &quot;lady&quot; of fifteen or even twenty years of age. The commissioned statue by Joseph Fabisch also failed to capture the extreme beauty and youth of the apparition, and Bernadette commented: &quot;too big, too old&quot;.

== Results of the visions ==
After investigation, Catholic Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862. In the 160 years since Soubirous dug up the spring, 70 cures have been verified by the Lourdes Medical Bureau as &quot;inexplicable&quot; – after what the Catholic Church claims are &quot;extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations&quot; that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained nothing out of the ordinary that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick: &quot;One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith&quot;.

Soubirous&#x27;s request to the local priest to build a chapel at the site of her visions eventually gave rise to a number of chapels and churches at Lourdes. The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes is now one of the major Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world. One of the churches built at the site, the Basilica of St. Pius X, can accommodate 25,000 people and was dedicated by the future Pope John XXIII when he was the Papal Nuncio to France. In 2013, 715,000 and in 2016, 570,000 pilgrims attended pilgrimage events. 
== Later years ==
Disliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the hospice school run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers where she had learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a postulant and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse, the Saint Gildard Convent at Nevers. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister Marie Therese Vauzou. The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde in honor of her godmother who was named &quot;Bernarde&quot;. As Patricia A. McEachern observes, &quot;Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron saint; she copied long texts related to him in notebooks and on bits of paper. The experience of becoming &#x27;Sister Marie-Bernard&#x27; marked a turning point for Bernadette as she realized more than ever that the great grace she received from the Queen of Heaven brought with it great responsibilities.&quot;

Soubirous spent the rest of her brief life at the motherhouse, working as an assistant in the infirmary and later as a sacristan, creating ornate embroidery for altar cloths and vestments. Her contemporaries admired her humility and spirit of sacrifice. One day, asked about the apparitions, she replied:

Soubirous had followed the development of Lourdes as a pilgrimage shrine while she still lived at Lourdes but was not present for the consecration of the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception there in 1876.

Unfortunately, Soubirous&#x27;s childhood bout of &quot;cholera left[...] [Bernadette] with severe, chronic asthma, and eventually she contracted tuberculosis of the lungs and bones.&quot; For several months prior to her death, she was unable to take an active part in convent life. She eventually died of her long-term illness at the age of 35 on 16 April 1879 (Easter Wednesday), while praying the Holy Rosary. On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin Mary&#x27;s admonition of &quot;Penance, Penance, Penance,&quot; Bernadette proclaimed that &quot;all this is good for Heaven!&quot; Her final words were, &quot;Blessed Mary, Mother of God, Pray for me&quot;. Soubirous&#x27; body was laid to rest in the St Joseph Chapel, in the grounds of her convent.

== Sainthood ==
Soubirous was declared blessed on 14 June 1921 by Pope Pius XI. She was canonized by Pius XI on 8 December 1933, the feast of the Immaculate Conception.

She is celebrated in the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church on 16 April. In France, her liturgical celebration is an optional memorial and is held on February 18, which commemorates Bernadette&#x27;s third vision – during which the &quot;lady&quot; told her that she does not promise to make her happy in this world, but in the other.

== Mortal remains ==


Bishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Catholic Church exhumed the body of Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the presence of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the crucifix in her hand and her rosary had both oxidized, her body appeared incorrupt – preserved from decomposition. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before re-burial in the Chapel of St Joseph in a new double casket.

The church exhumed the corpse a second time on 3 April 1919, on the occasion of the approval of Bernadette&#x27;s canonization. Dr. Comte, who examined the body, noted, &quot;The body is practically mummified, covered with patches of mildew and quite a notable layer of salts, which appear to be calcium salts.[...] The skin has disappeared in some places, but it is still present on most parts of the body.&quot; Again, the body was returned to the vault of St Joseph&#x27;s chapel.

In 1925, the church exhumed the body for a third time. They took relics, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of the face was molded to make a wax mask based on the imprints and on some genuine photos to be placed on her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would be viewed as corruption by the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and crystal reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the main church of the convent 

Three years later in 1928, Doctor Comte published a report on the third exhumation of Soubirous in the second issue of the .

In 1970, the convent at Nevers was converted into a pilgrimage centre dedicated to Soubirous, run by volunteers and a few sisters and known as Espace Bernadette Soubirous Nevers.

In the spring of 2015, the town of Lourdes lobbied for Soubirous&#x27;s remains to be returned to Lourdes, a move opposed by the city of Nevers.

== Minor relics ==

The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes has a few bodily relics which traveled in several European dioceses from 2017 to be exposed for the veneration of people. In 2019, a new reliquary was built for the travel of the relics. In 2022, the reliquary visited the United States and the United Kingdom. The relics first traveled to the United States from April to August 2022, visiting around thirty dioceses. In September and October 2022, the relics where exposed in around fifty places in England, Scotland, and Wales, including in the Westminster Cathedral and at the Carfin Lourdes Grotto.

== Places ==

The town of Lourdes where Bernadette grew up and had her visions has become a major international pilgrimage site attracting millions of visitors each year. Several churches and infrastructures were built around the cave where the apparitions occurred, forming together the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes. The sanctuary is reputed for the Lourdes water streaming inside the cave from a spring discovered by Bernadette during the apparitions, which is said to have healing properties, attracting many sick pilgrims. The most recent church in the sanctuary is the St. Bernadette Church, completed in 1988. The sanctuary also has a museum called the St. Bernadette Museum, dedicated to the history of the apparitions. In the city center of Lourdes, pilgrims can visit the house where Bernadette was born and the room where her family was staying at the time of the apparitions.

Hundreds of Lourdes grottos were built all over the world after the apparitions to allow believers to venerate Our Lady of Lourdes in their own countries, specially those who could not afford to make the expensive and long trip to Lourdes. These replicas of the original cave where the apparitions occurred recreate the scenes of the apparitions, usually with a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes in a niche and a statue of Bernadette on her knees and praying or holding a candle.

The Espace Bernadette Soubirous Nevers, is dedicated to her memory. This is where her body has been kept after her death. Her body is now exposed for the veneration of visitors. The city of Nevers also has a museum dedicated to the life of Bernadette, called the &quot;Bernadette Museum&quot;.

Numerous churches, shrines and Catholic schools are named after St. Bernadette all over the world. The first church in Europe to be dedicated to her was the Church of Our Lady of Victories and St Bernadette at Ensbury Park, Bournemouth, southwest England: it was under construction at the time of her canonisation and opened in 1934.

<doc id="240952" wikidata="Q179334" url="?curid=240952" title="Henrik Larsson">
<text>Edward Henrik Larsson (; born 20 September 1971) is a Swedish professional football coach and former player who played many times for the Swedish national team. A striker, Larsson began his career with Högaborgs BK. In 1992, he moved to Helsingborg IF where in his first campaign he helped the club win promotion to Allsvenskan after 24 seasons. He moved to Feyenoord in November 1993, staying for four years before leaving in 1997 to join Scottish Premiership club Celtic and enjoying great success there. During his time in the Dutch Eredivisie, he won two KNVB Cups with Feyenoord. He later played for Barcelona, earning the Spanish title twice and the Champions League before returning to Helsingborg. He ended his career with a loan spell at Manchester United, with whom he won the English Premier League in 2006–07. 

Larsson is often regarded as one of the greatest foreign imports in Scottish football, having been signed by Wim Jansen for Celtic in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. In his first season at the club, he played a crucial role in Celtic winning their first league title in ten years. Larsson suffered a broken leg in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon in 1999. He returned to score 53 goals in a 2000–01 season that saw him win the European Golden Shoe. Larsson won four league titles in his seven years at Celtic. He also helped the team reach the 2003 UEFA Cup final against Porto, scoring both goals in a 3–2 defeat in extra time. His 242 goals in 313 matches saw Celtic fans nickname him &quot;The King of Kings&quot;.

Larsson played for Sweden in three FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships, winning a bronze medal at the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and is a former captain of the national team. He ended his international career with 37 goals in 106 matches. He also won the Golden Ball (&quot;Guldbollen&quot;), the annual Award for best Swedish footballer twice, first in 1998 and again in 2004, while in 2003 he was named the Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years as part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards. He is also the second all-time leading goalscorer in the UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League.

In 2010, Larsson began his career as a manager at the Superettan club Landskrona BoIS, where he stayed for three seasons. He later managed Falkenberg in Allsvenskan, and he took over at Helsingborg in 2015, where his son, Jordan, was one of his players. Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan in 2016 and Larsson left the club. Three years later he made a brief return in the same role at the club. He served Barcelona as assistant to Ronald Koeman from August 2020 until October 2021.

==Early life==
Edward Henrik Larsson was born on 20 September 1971 in Helsingborg, Scania. His father, Francisco Da Rocha, is Cape Verdean, and his mother, Eva Larsson, is Swedish. His parents, who never married and split up when he was 12, decided that he should take his mother&#x27;s surname because they felt it would make it easier for their son to be accepted in Sweden. He credits his father for his love of football. His father gave him a football when he was 16 months old and as a child, he was able to practice with brothers and friends on a large field near his home on the Närlunda estate in Helsingborg. He has said of his school years, &quot;I experienced some racism, because back then it was unusual to have a dark kid at school, I was one of the few.&quot; He watched English football on television and his parents gave him a video of Pelé&#x27;s life story, both of which inspired him.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Larsson began playing at lower-league Högaborg at age six. This smaller club was known to provide a good education for young players, and since Larsson left he has stressed how important this was not only for his football but also for his adult life in general. He went on to start his professional career playing for their senior team at age 17 while still at school. When he was 18, he had a trial at Benfica, at the time being managed by Larsson&#x27;s country-mate Sven-Göran Eriksson. On leaving school at 18, Larsson combined a semi-pro football career at Högaborg with work as a fruit packer.

In four years playing at senior level with Högaborg, Larsson scored 23 goals in 74 matches. In 1992, second division side Helsingborg (the main club of his home city) signed Larsson.

===Helsingborg===
In his first year as a full-time professional, Larsson scored 34 goals for Helsingborg and his partnership up front with veteran striker Mats Magnusson helped the side win promotion to the top Swedish division, the Allsvenskan, the club&#x27;s return to the top tier after 24 seasons in the lower divisions. His star continued to rise the following year, as he netted 16 goals to help Helsingborg to a respectable mid-table finish.

The Södra was split into Spring and Autumn leagues, Henrik scored 15 goals in 14 games in the former and 17 goals in 13 games in the latter. After then failing to score in the 3 placement qualifier matches, he scored twice in a 9–1 aggregate play-off win against IFK Sundsvall that sealed promotion.

===Feyenoord===
In November 1993, Dutch side Feyenoord signed Larsson for a fee of £295,000. He made his league debut on 21 November 1993 as a substitute for Regi Blinker in a 1–1 home draw against Vitesse. Larsson took time to adjust to working and living in a foreign country and could only muster a modest 6 goals in 27 appearances in his first season. His goalscoring record improved in subsequent seasons, but he continued to be unsettled and frustrated by a combination of ever-changing coaches, being played in unfamiliar positions and latterly the club&#x27;s player-rotation policy which saw him being substituted fifty or sixty minutes into a match even when playing well.

Larsson won his first major winner&#x27;s medal on 12 May 1994 when he played in the Feyenoord side that defeated NEC 2–1 in the final of the KNVB Cup. The following season, Larsson won his second winner&#x27;s medal in the same tournament when Feyenoord won 2–1 against Volendam. He did record a hat-trick in a 4–3 win against Werder Bremen in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1994–95.

In 1997, Larsson told manager Arie Haan that he wished to leave the club. A legal dispute then ensued over a clause in his contract that Larsson claimed would allow him to be sold on if a fee of £600,000 was offered. Larsson won his case and in July 1997, he signed for Scottish side Celtic.

===Celtic===

====1997–2000====
Following the contract dispute with Feyenoord, Larsson was signed by Celtic manager Wim Jansen in July 1997 for a fee of £650,000. In his first season at Celtic, he played the role of supporting forward alongside Darren Jackson, Simon Donnelly and later Harald Brattbakk.

In Larsson&#x27;s Celtic debut, against Hibernian at Easter Road, he came on as a late substitute. He inadvertently passed the ball to Hibernian player Chic Charnley, who scored, resulting in a 2–1 defeat for Celtic. He scored an own goal in his first European game, although Celtic did go on to win 6–3 against Austrian side Tirol Innsbruck. He went on to score 19 goals in all competitions, and was Celtic&#x27;s top scorer for the season. In November 1997, Larsson won his first medal for the club after a 3–0 win over Dundee United at Ibrox Stadium gave Celtic the Scottish League Cup. Larsson scored Celtic&#x27;s second goal in the match. On the final day of the league season, he scored the opener with a powerful shot from 20 yards out in a 2–0 win against St Johnstone to clinch the championship for Celtic. It was the club&#x27;s first league championship win since the double winning season 1987–88 and stopped Old Firm rivals Rangers from breaking Celtic&#x27;s record of nine titles in a row. He finished fourth in the voting for the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 1998.

Larsson&#x27;s second season with the club saw a change in management with Jozef Vengloš taking over following Wim Jansen&#x27;s resignation. Playing in a more advanced striker&#x27;s role, Larsson scored 38 goals to end the season as both Celtic and Scotland&#x27;s top goalscorer. During the season, Larsson also scored for the first time in an Old Firm match, with two goals in a 5–1 victory in November, and the equaliser in the 2–2 New Year&#x27;s Day match at Ibrox. Throughout the season, Larsson forged a prolific partnership with diminutive Slovak playmaker Ľubomír Moravčík. He was also awarded the honours of SPFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year, SFWA Footballer of the Year, and Swedish Footballer of the Year. The 1998–99 season ultimately proved disappointing for Celtic, as they finished runners-up to rivals Rangers in both the newly established Scottish Premier League (SPL), and the Scottish Cup.

The 1999–2000 season saw another change in management for Celtic. Former Liverpool and England international winger John Barnes replaced Vengloš to become manager at the club. The season started very brightly for Larsson as he scored eight league goals in nine games for the club. During Celtic&#x27;s 1–0 defeat in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon on 21 October 1999, Larsson suffered a career-threatening injury, breaking his leg in two places in a challenge with Serge Blanc. This resulted in him spending eight months on the sidelines, only returning on the last day of the 1999–2000 season. John Barnes cited Larsson&#x27;s injury as being a significant factor in his sacking by Celtic after only months in the position. It was initially feared that Larsson had suffered a compound leg fracture, an injury which would normally result in an even longer absence – or possibly even end his career – but X-rays soon revealed that the injury was not as serious as originally feared. Larsson made a temporary return in March and scored three goals in two under-21 matches, but a sustained injury to his left shin in a third match meant he missed the 2000 Scottish League Cup Final. By the time Larsson had completed his full rehabilitation, John Barnes had been sacked and replaced by director of football Kenny Dalglish as interim manager. Larsson made his comeback with a substitute appearance against Dundee United at Celtic Park on the final day of the SPL season.

====2000–03====
Following the arrival of Martin O&#x27;Neill in the summer of 2000, Larsson had his most successful season for Celtic. He began a successful partnership with new arrival Chris Sutton, as he scored 35 league goals in 38 league games to become SPL top goalscorer and to win the European Golden Shoe. The season saw Celtic win the domestic treble of the Scottish League Cup, Scottish Cup and the SPL. Larsson scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock at Hampden Park to win the Scottish League Cup, the first non-Scottish player to do so in a cup final in Scotland. He also scored twice in the Scottish Cup in a 3–0 win over Hibernian. Other highlights for Larsson included two goals against Rangers in the 6–2 win at Parkhead early in the season, breaking Charlie Nicholas&#x27; post-war club record of 48 goals (in all competitions) in a season, with a brace against Dundee United in the Scottish Cup semi finals, equalling Brian McClair&#x27;s post-war club record of 35 league goals in season with a goal in a 5–2 defeat of Hibs, and scoring his 50th goal of the season against Rangers at Ibrox in a 3–0 victory towards the end of the season and finishing the season with a total of 53 goals in all competitions. He was again voted SPFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year, as well as SFWA Footballer of the Year and &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; Scottish Player of the Year.

Rangers manager Dick Advocaat said &quot;Larsson is one of the best strikers in Europe, maybe the world. If you watch Batistuta, he is sometimes not seen for 90 minutes but he scores two goals. Larsson has even more, because, besides being a good player and goalscorer, he has a tremendous work rate.&quot;

Larsson&#x27;s fifth season at Celtic yielded a second consecutive SPL title for the club. It also marked the club&#x27;s first foray into the UEFA Champions League group stage. Larsson scored his first Champions League goal with a penalty in Celtic&#x27;s opening fixture in a 3–2 defeat to Juventus in Turin. He scored again for Celtic in their Champions League campaign with the only goal in a 1–0 victory over Porto, and again from the penalty spot against Juventus in a thrilling 4–3 victory at Celtic Park. Despite achieving a Scottish record of nine points in the group stage, Celtic failed to qualify for the latter stages and parachuted into the UEFA Cup. The club were drawn against Valencia, with Larsson scoring the second leg goal to take the tie into penalties, which Celtic eventually lost. Larsson once again ended the season as SPL top goalscorer with 29 goals from 33 league appearances.

The 2002–03 season saw the club reach the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. After losing out on a place in the Champions League following an away goals defeat to Basel, Celtic dropped into the UEFA Cup. In the first round, Celtic were paired with Lithuanian side Sūduva, with Larsson scoring a hat-trick in the 8–1 first leg victory, as they progressed 10–1 on aggregate after adding a 2–0 away win. The second round saw former Rangers player-manager Graeme Souness&#x27; Blackburn Rovers side visit Celtic Park in a matched dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;. Celtic went into the second leg at Ewood Park 1–0 up courtesy of a late Larsson goal. His winning goal (his 22nd European goal for Celtic) meant he became the all-time top scorer for a Scottish club in European competition. After comments from the Blackburn players in the media, who felt their team deserved to win, claiming that the tie was &quot;like men against boys&quot;, Larsson scored the opening goal in a 2–0 away win. The following rounds saw Celtic beat Celta Vigo 2–2 on away goals, and VfB Stuttgart 5–4 on aggregate. Larsson missed both ties with Stuttgart, following a broken jaw, after a collision with Gustave Bahoken in an SPL match against Livingston, but he returned from injury in time for Celtic&#x27;s quarter-final clash with 2001 winners Liverpool. Larsson scored the opener in a 1–1 draw at Celtic Park. Celtic followed that up with a 2–0 victory at Anfield to win the tie 3–1 on aggregate,

Celtic met Portuguese side Boavista in the semi-final. Boavista took the advantage on away goals after a 1–1 draw in the first leg, in which Larsson scored the equaliser after missing a penalty. In the second leg, Larsson struck for Celtic after a one-two with John Hartson with ten minutes remaining. The goal sent Celtic through to their first European final since 1970. The final in Seville against Porto saw Larsson equalise twice with two headers, although Celtic eventually lost 3–2 after extra time. Larsson also finished runner-up to Porto&#x27;s Derlei in the competition&#x27;s goalscoring charts. Larsson described the pain of the defeat as being the worst moment of his career, including his broken leg in 1999. More disappointment followed, as Celtic finished runners-up to Rangers on the last day of the SPL season, by only a single goal on goal difference. 2003 also saw Larsson voted as the Greatest Swedish Footballer of the Last 50 Years as part of the UEFA Jubilee Awards. He also finished the season again the top SPL goalscorer with 28 goals from 35 games. 

Larsson was nominated for both the Ballon d&#x27;Or and UEFA Team of the Year in 2001, and again in 2003. He placed 14th (2001) and 12th (2003) for the Ballon d&#x27;Or. He finished runner-up for the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 2003 as well.

====2003–04====
Larsson&#x27;s seventh and final season for Celtic saw the club win the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Cup titles.

Larsson broke the record for European goals with the same British club (shared by Ian Rush and Peter Lorimer) after scoring his 31st European goal for Celtic in a Champions League qualifier against MTK Hungaria. Larsson scored his only Champions League goal of the season against Anderlecht in a 3–1 win at Celtic Park. He added to his European goal tally with a double in a 3–0 UEFA Cup third round victory over Teplice, and the equaliser in a first leg quarter-final tie at Celtic Park against Villarreal, after earlier having a goal disallowed for handball; the match ended 1–1. It was Larsson&#x27;s final European goal for Celtic. After parachuting from the Champions League, Celtic reached the UEFA Cup quarter-finals, eliminating Barcelona en route, before losing 3–1 on aggregate to Villarreal. In March 2004, Larsson equalled Bobby Lennox&#x27;s post-war record of 167 league goals and went level with Stevie Chalmers&#x27; 231 goals for the club with strike in 2-1 win over Dundee.

Celtic defeated Rangers in all five Old Firm fixtures that season. Larsson&#x27;s final goal against Rangers came in a 1–0 Scottish Cup win at Parkhead. His final competitive game at home for Celtic came in a league match against Dundee United on 16 May 2004, and he scored both goals as Celtic won 2–1. In his last competitive appearance for Celtic, he scored two goals to defeat Dunfermline Athletic on 22 May 2004 at Hampden and win the 2004 Scottish Cup Final.

Larsson was also voted Swedish Footballer of the Year for the second time for his performances throughout the 2003–04 season. He was also again a nominee for the Ballon d&#x27;Or but received no votes.

After leaving Celtic, Larsson returned to play in testimonial matches three times. In May 2005, he played in Jackie McNamara&#x27;s testimonial against the Republic of Ireland, In May 2008, Larsson left Sweden&#x27;s national training camp early to take part in a match played in memory of Larsson&#x27;s former teammate Phil O&#x27;Donnell, who had died in December 2007 while playing in a match for Motherwell. Larsson played as part of Celtic&#x27;s 1998 championship-winning side against the Motherwell 1991 Scottish Cup-winning side. On 9 August 2011, Larsson played for the Celtic Legends against the Manchester United Legends for John Kennedy&#x27;s testimonial He has since returned to play in a further three charity matches at Celtic Park. He played for a Celtic XI against a Petrov XI in 2013, for Henrik&#x27;s Heroes against Lubo&#x27;s Legends in 2017, and for a Petrov XI against Milner XI in 2018.

====Legacy====
In his seven years at Celtic, Larsson won four SPL titles, two Scottish League Cups and two Scottish Cups. He was the top goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League for five of the six seasons that he competed in, the only exception being the 1999–2000 season, most of which Larsson missed due to a broken leg. He was the SPL (1998–2013) record goalscorer with 158 goals (Kris Boyd broke his record in 2009).

Larsson has currently scored the third most goals in Celtic&#x27;s history (only Jimmy McGrory and Bobby Lennox scored more), which includes a total of 15 hat-tricks. Larsson was also a consistent goalscorer in European competition. With 35 goals, Larsson is the record goalscorer for Celtic in UEFA competitions. Celtic fans selected Larsson (the only player from outside Scotland) in the greatest ever Celtic team, when a vote was held in 2002.

Larsson played a testimonial match on 25 May 2004 against Sevilla in front of a capacity crowd at Celtic Park. In all, he scored 242 goals for Celtic in 313 matches, and his performances earned him the nickname &quot;The King of Kings&quot; from fans.

===Barcelona===
At the end of the 2003–04 season, Larsson left Celtic on a free transfer and signed a one-year contract with Barcelona with an option for a second year. Larsson&#x27;s contribution in &quot;Barça&quot; La Liga win in his first season there was disrupted by serious injury. He scored 3 goals in 12 Liga games and one goal (against his former club Celtic) in four Champions League matches. After the match against Celtic, he said: &quot;It was very difficult for me to celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here.&quot; On 20 November 2004, during the 3–0 victory in &quot;El Clásico&quot; against Real Madrid, Larsson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee. Despite his injury-hit 2004–05 season, playing only 16 games, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract.

In December 2005, Larsson announced that at the end of his contract, which ended in July, he would leave Barcelona and return to Sweden to end his career. He revealed that he had refused an offer by club president Joan Laporta to extend his contract to the end of the next season. On the announcement of his departure, Ronaldinho said:

In Larsson&#x27;s final match for Barcelona, his substitute introduction was pivotal to win the 2006 Champions League final. Larsson assisted both of Barcelona&#x27;s goals in a 2–1 win over Arsenal. Thierry Henry paid tribute to Larsson&#x27;s contribution to Barcelona&#x27;s win after the match, saying, &quot;People always talk about Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto&#x27;o, Ludovic Giuly and everything, but I didn&#x27;t see them today, I saw Henrik Larsson. He came on, he changed the game, that is what killed the game. Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto&#x27;o and people like that; you need to talk about the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight.&quot; Indeed, his ability to give Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by the international press. In 2005–06, Larsson scored ten goals as Barcelona won La Liga for a second consecutive year.

In his time at the Camp Nou, 
Larsson’s shirt was the third most popular at Barcelona’s club shop. Only Ronaldinho and Eto’o shirts outsold his. Larsson would also again be shortlisted for UEFA Team of the Year in 2006 for his performances.

===Return to Helsingborg===
After Sweden&#x27;s elimination from the 2006 FIFA World Cup on 24 June 2006, Larsson joined up with his former club, Helsingborg. He made his second debut for his home town club against Hammarby in the Swedish Cup on 6 July 2006. Helsingborg went on to win the competition, defeating Gefle 2–0 in the final on 11 November 2006, earning Larsson another medal. Larsson&#x27;s eight league goals in 15 appearances also helped his team to a fourth-place finish in the Allsvenskan. This successful season earned Helsingborg a slot in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup.

He registered two goals and two assists in three Royal League matches just before leaving on loan.

====Loan to Manchester United====
Shortly after rejoining Helsingborg, Larsson was signed on loan by Manchester United from 1 January until 12 March 2007, coinciding with the Allsvenskan&#x27;s off-season. He scored on his debut against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on 7 January 2007 at Old Trafford, facing his former Celtic manager Martin O&#x27;Neill. Larsson scored his first ever FA Premier League goal on 31 January in a 4–0 win over Watford.

While United were eager to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated that he had made a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was confirmed on 20 February, when Larsson announced that he would not be extending his loan period. Despite this, Alex Ferguson praised the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he&#x27;s done has been excellent.&quot; &quot;We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – but I would have done anything to keep him.&quot; Larsson scored Manchester United&#x27;s only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2–2 draw.

Manchester United won the Premier League two months after Larsson had left the club, Larsson had not played the required quota of ten league games to qualify for a Premier League winners medal. Despite media reports to the contrary, Larsson stated in 2019 that he did not receive a medal.

Larsson&#x27;s next appearance at Old Trafford in fact came against United, the day after his loan with the club expired, as captain for the Europe XI team in the UEFA Celebration Match. Larsson received a standing ovation from the home fans upon being substituted for Liverpool player Robbie Fowler.

==== 2007–09 ====
After leaving Manchester United in March 2007, Larsson resumed his career with Helsingborg. Larsson helped the club through the preliminary stages of the UEFA Cup, where Larsson scored twice against Estonian side Narva Trans and once against League of Ireland side Drogheda United. The first round proper of the UEFA Cup that season saw a high-scoring tie between Helsingborg and Heerenveen, Larsson&#x27;s side lost 5–3 in the Netherlands on 20 September 2007, with Larsson scoring twice. The return leg in Sweden on 4 October 2007 saw Helsingborg win 5–1, Larsson again scoring, to win the tie 8–6 on aggregate and qualify for the group stage. Helsingborg progressed from the group stage, with Larsson scoring against Panionios, Austria Wien and Bordeaux, and they qualified for the round of 32, where they lost 1–4 on aggregate to PSV in February 2008. Helsingborg could not match their league performances of the previous year, and finished in eight place in Allsvenskan in 2007. Helsingborg also failed to retain the Swedish Cup, losing 1–2 to BoIS in the fourth round in June 2007.

The 2008 Allsvenskan saw Larsson produce his best league goal-scoring tally since returning to Sweden, with his 14 goals helping Helsingborg to fourth place and qualification in 2009–10 for the rebranded UEFA Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup.

In July 2009, Larsson scored three goals in the Europa League qualifying ties against Eastern European minnows Mika and Zestaponi. He broke his knee-cap during the first leg of the next qualifying round against Sarajevo on 30 July 2009, and was out for an estimated eight weeks. Some reports at the time suggested that this in fact was the end of his playing career, with this injury also coming on top of the recent death of his younger brother, Robert. He returned to the first team on 16 September 2009, appearing as a substitute in a 1–3 defeat against IFK Göteborg in the Swedish Cup, and then on 24 September 2009 in his first start since returning from injury, he scored two goals (including the winner) against league rivals AIK. He is Helsingborg&#x27;s record goalscorer in UEFA competitions with 12 goals.

On 20 October 2009, Larsson announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2009 Allsvenskan. The announcement followed a previous statement from the player declaring his intention to retire from international duty. Larsson had also stated his desire to move into coaching and expressed his intent to study for coaching qualifications in Scotland under the Scottish Football Association system. Larsson also discussed the possibility of taking up floorball on a full-time basis.

Larsson took to the pitch for the final time in Helsingborg&#x27;s 2–0 Allsvenskan loss to Djurgården on 28 October 2009, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd.

As of his retirement, he remains the Swedish player with the most goals scored (59) in UEFA competitions (Zlatan Ibrahimovic is next on 57).

===Playing activity after retirement===
Larsson participated in the Soccer Aid football match at Old Trafford on 6 June 2010 for the Rest of the World team in aid of UNICEF. Larsson made a promise that at the end of his football career, he would play one season at his first club, Högaborg. When he retired at the end of the 2009 season, that promise was not fulfilled. In August 2010, however, Larsson played with Högaborg&#x27;s veterans team and scored 16 goals in 5 matches.

In August 2012, Larsson came out of retirement for a brief spell at Swedish fifth division (Division 3) side Råå. He made one appearance, coming on as a substitute in a league match on 22 September 2012, a 1–1 draw against Höganäs. Larsson then registered as a player with Högaborg&#x27;s senior-recreational side and played games with them. Due to the many injuries, Larsson was included in the first-team squad that beat Tenhult with 4–2 on 19 June 2013. He came off the bench in the 85th minute, and played alongside his son, Jordan. At age 42, Larsson took part in a further league match for Högaborg on 26 October 2013, when he played the first 66 minutes in a 2–0 win over IF Haga. At age 44, Larsson took part in a 7–1 friendly win for Helsingborg over IFK Malmö, in which he scored in the 89th minute.

==International career==
Larsson scored 37 goals in 106 matches for the Sweden national team. He scored his first international goal in his debut on 13 October 1993, during the FIFA World Cup qualifications stage, in a 3–2 win against Finland.

===1994 FIFA World Cup===
Sweden manager Tommy Svensson selected Larsson for his 22-man squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup squad, alongside established forwards such as Tomas Brolin, Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin. Larsson began Sweden&#x27;s first game of the tournament, against Cameroon, on the bench, but came on as a substitute with Sweden trailing 1–2. Larsson struck a fierce, long-range shot against the crossbar, with Dahlin reacting quickly to score the rebound to give their country a 2–2 draw. He again came on as a late substitute in the following game against Russia, and then played from the start in the final game of the group against Brazil. He was not used in the last 16 game against Saudi Arabia, but came on a substitute in the quarter-final tie against Romania. The match finished 2–2 after extra time, with Sweden winning on penalties, one of which was scored by Larsson. Larsson did not feature in Sweden&#x27;s 0–1 defeat against Brazil in the semi-final, but did play in the third-place play-off against Bulgaria which Sweden won 4–0, including Larsson&#x27;s first World Cup goal, latching onto a through-ball from Brolin before rounding Bulgarian goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov and wrong-footing defender Trifon Ivanov. That win secured third-place at the 1994 FIFA World Cup for Sweden, their best showing in a tournament since finishing runner-up to Brazil in 1958.

===Euro 1996 and 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers===
Larsson became a regular in the side after that, playing in six of his country&#x27;s qualifiers for Euro 1996. He did not score in any of these matches and Sweden failed to qualify for the finals.

He scored one goal in four qualifying games as Sweden also failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

===Euro 2000===
Sweden succeeded in qualifying for Euro 2000, with Larsson scoring three goals during the qualifying matches. Larsson was selected for the Sweden squad despite having only just recovered from a broken leg sustained playing for Celtic. Euro 2000 was not a great success for Sweden, who went out at the first group stage, but Larsson scored against Italy in a 1–2 defeat.

===2002 FIFA World Cup and first retirement===
Sweden reappeared on the global stage two years later at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Larsson helped guide Sweden out of the group of death and into the knockout round with a 2–1 win over Nigeria in which he scored both goals. He then scored in the round of 16 match against Senegal, though Sweden ended up losing 1–2 in extra time to a golden goal and were eliminated. Larsson chose to retire from international football after the World Cup.

===Euro 2004===
Larsson&#x27;s decision to retire from international football was met with dismay in Sweden and there was much clamoring for him to return to the team for their campaign at Euro 2004 in Portugal. Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, he eventually agreed to return to the national side for Euro 2004. Playing up front alongside Zlatan Ibrahimović, Larsson scored three goals in four matches and lead Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a penalty shoot-out by the Netherlands. Larsson&#x27;s diving header against Bulgaria was voted best goal of the tournament.

===2006 FIFA World Cup and second retirement===
Larsson also featured at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. He scored in the final minute of the match against England for Sweden to draw the match 2–2 in their final match in the group stages. The goal sealed Sweden&#x27;s qualification for the second round of the tournament. In Sweden&#x27;s last 16 game against hosts Germany, Larsson missed a penalty and Sweden went out with the score at 2–0 to Germany.

He retired from international football for the second time on 17 July 2006. &quot;It is time to quit now. It feels right. I&#x27;m done with the national team&quot;, the 34-year-old Larsson told TV station Canal Plus.

===Euro 2008===
Sweden boss Lars Lagerbäck managed to lure Larsson out of international retirement once more and on 13 May 2008, the Swedish Football Association officially declared that Larsson had agreed to make a comeback and play for Sweden once again at Euro 2008. Larsson assisted Zlatan Ibrahimovic for a goal against Greece in the first group stage game, but could not help Sweden advance to the quarter-finals.

===2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying and final retirement===
Following former team captain Freddie Ljungberg&#x27;s decision to quit the national side after the tournament, Larsson was chosen to become the new captain in a friendly match against France on 20 August 2008, He scored his 37th goal for Sweden in that match, although France ended up winning 3–2. He played his 100th game for Sweden on 6 September 2008, in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Albania, which ended in a 0–0 draw.

On 11 October 2009, after it was clear that Sweden had failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Larsson once again decided to retire from the national team.
At the age of 38 years and 20 days, Larsson became the oldest outfield player in the history of the Sweden national team with his last ever appearance against Denmark on 10 October 2009. Since then, Zlatan Ibrahimović has become Sweden&#x27;s oldest outfield player.

==Managerial career==
Larsson made clear his intentions to take up coaching once his playing career came to an end, having also expressed an interest in returning to Celtic in a coaching capacity.

===Landskrona BoIS===
On 14 December 2009 Larsson was appointed manager at Landskrona BoIS, a Swedish second division football club, on a one-year contract.

The news that Larsson would take over Landskrona was received with mixed feelings, as his former club Helsingborg traditionally were their main rivals.

The 2010 Superettan, the first season for Larsson as a manager, started off positively for Landskrona. With an aggressively attacking 4–3–3 formation Larsson&#x27;s club lined up victories and fought for the top positions and promotion to Allsvenskan, until the very end of the season. They finished in fifth place. The Landskrona BoIS board was satisfied with the results, and both Larsson and his assistant manager Hans Eklund renewed their contracts for another year.

On 23 March 2011, Landskrona BoIS announced the recruitment of the Sweden national team qualified midfielder Marcus Lantz from Helsingborg, a solicitation that was largely thanks to Larsson. With the recruitment of Lantz, Henrik Larsson announced a major effort to make the club win Superettan and be promoted to Allsvenskan, from which they were relegated in 2005.

Before the 2011 Superettan season, the managers of the other Superettan clubs had tipped Landskrona as the likely champion. But the season was about to become the club&#x27;s worst in years. Instead of being in the top of the table, Landskrona was stuck at the bottom more than halfway into the season, with relegation looming. Some fans protested against both the board and Henrik Larsson, sarcastically suggesting that the club had used an impostor instead of the real Larsson. The crisis went so deep within the association that the board wanted Larsson himself to make a comeback as a player. Larsson played for 20 minutes with Landskrona&#x27;s reserve team in a match against Mjällby AIF, but felt physically unprepared for playing in Superettan, even if the sporting director of Landskrona, Mats Aronsson, believed the opposite. Landskrona and Larsson avoided relegation and finished tenth largely because of the summer signing of goalkeeper Ivo Vazgeč who achieved the best save percentage in the league.

On 21 November 2011, Larsson signed a new one-year contract, making him manager for Landskrona during the 2012 Superettan as well. Landskrona performed better in 2012, but only managed to finish in sixth place instead of achieving the third-place finish which would have meant qualification for a promotion play-off spot. In November 2012, Larsson confirmed he had left his position and would consider any available posts elsewhere.

===Falkenberg===
On 4 December 2013, Larsson was appointed manager of Falkenberg, signing a one-year rolling contact with the newly promoted club. After securing Falkenberg&#x27;s position in Allsvenskan, it was announced on 10 November 2014 that he would not manage the club for the 2015 season.

===Helsingborg===
After leaving Falkenberg, Larsson was appointed manager of Helsingborg. In November 2016, Helsingborg were relegated to Superettan after losing a two-legged play-off against Halmstad. After the final whistle, a minor group of disappointed home fans attacked both Larsson and his son, Jordan. Following the end of the season, Larsson decided to leave the club.

===Ängelholms FF===
After turning down the opportunity to manage Scottish side Livingston, Division 1 club Ängelholms FF announced on 3 October 2018 that Larsson would join the staff as assistant to head coach Alexander Tengryd, whom Larsson had worked together with in Helsingborg. At the time of his appointment, Ängelholm were on 13 place and five matches in a row without a win with six matches left of the season. First match with Larsson in the staff was three days later against Utsiktens BK away. The match ended in a 1–0 win for Ängelholm. Ängelholm would only take two points in their last five matches, including losing 0–4 to Oskarshamns AIK and 0–3 to Tvååker, and dropped to 15th place which meant immediate relegation. Larsson, along with head coach Alexander Tengryd, left the club at the end of the season.

===Return to Helsingborgs IF===
On 16 June 2019, Helsingborg announced that Larsson had returned to the club as their new manager.

On 23 August 2019, Helsingborg announced that Larsson had decided to quit as head coach after being verbally assaulted on social media following the club&#x27;s loss to third tier club Oskarshamns AIK in the qualification to Svenska Cupen group stage.

In September 2019 he began talks with English club Southend United about becoming their manager, but these collapsed when proposed assistant Tommy Johnson accepted another offer.

=== Barcelona ===
On 21 August 2020, FC Barcelona announced that Larsson and Alfred Schreuder had joined new head coach Ronald Koeman‘s coaching staff until 30 June 2022. On 27 October 2021, the club confirmed Koeman had been relieved of his duties, which resulted in the departure of Larsson from FC Barcelona&#x27;s coaching staff.

==Floorball career==
Larsson also played floorball at a competitive level in 1989. On 23 November 2008, he resumed his floorball career when he played his first Swedish Super League game for Helsingborg. In his second game for the club, he made two assists, and was voted man of the match.

==Style of play==
Larsson stood out for his discipline, professionalism and work-rate throughout his career.

==Personal life==
On 21 June 1996, Larsson married Magdalena Spjuth, whom he had met in a restaurant when he was 19 years old. She is the daughter of a politician and an education director at the local municipality. They have a son, professional footballer Jordan Larsson (born 1997 and named after basketball player Michael Jordan), who has represented Sweden at international level, and a daughter, Janelle Larsson (born 2002), a member of the junior Sweden national show jumping team.

On 6 June 2009, before Sweden&#x27;s 1–0 loss against Denmark, Larsson&#x27;s younger brother Robert, who had a troubled personal life, was found dead in his flat in their hometown of Helsingborg. Henrik was not told until after the match had concluded. Henrik Larsson also has an elder half-brother, Kim.

<text>A Gaussian year is defined as 365.2568983 days. It was adopted by Carl Friedrich Gauss as the length of the sidereal year in his studies of the dynamics of the solar system.
A slightly different value is now accepted as the length of the sidereal year,
and the value accepted by Gauss is given a special name.

A particle of negligible mass, that orbits a body of 1 solar mass in this period, has a mean axis for its orbit of 1 astronomical unit by definition. The value is derived from Kepler&#x27;s third law as

:formula_1

where

:&quot;k&quot; is the Gaussian gravitational constant.

<doc id="240960" wikidata="Q13107540" url="?curid=240960" title="Hydration reaction">
<text>In chemistry, a hydration reaction is a chemical reaction in which a substance combines with water. In organic chemistry, water is added to an unsaturated substrate, which is usually an alkene or an alkyne. This type of reaction is employed industrially to produce ethanol, isopropanol, and butan-2-ol.

==Organic chemistry==
Any unsaturated organic compound is susceptible to hydration. 
===Epoxides to glycol===
Several million tons of ethylene glycol are produced annually by the hydration of oxirane, a cyclic compound also known as ethylene oxide:
: C2H4O + H2O → HO–CH2CH2–OH

Acid catalysts are typically used.

=== Alkenes===
The general chemical equation for the hydration of alkenes is the following:
:RRC=CH2 + H2O → RRC(OH)-CH3
A hydroxyl group (OH−) attaches to one carbon of the double bond, and a proton (H+) adds to the other. The reaction is highly exothermic. In the first step, the alkene acts as a nucleophile and attacks the proton, following Markovnikov&#x27;s rule. In the second step an H2O molecule bonds to the other, more highly substituted carbon. The oxygen atom at this point has three bonds and carries a positive charge (i.e., the molecule is an oxonium). Another water molecule comes along and takes up the extra proton. This reaction tends to yield many undesirable side products, (for example diethyl ether in the process of creating ethanol) and in its simple form described here is not considered very useful for the production of alcohol.

Two approaches are taken. Traditionally the alkene is treated with sulfuric acid to give alkyl sulphate esters. In the case of ethanol production, this step can be written:
:H2SO4 + C2H4 → C2H5-O-SO3H
Subsequently, this sulphate ester is hydrolyzed to regenerate sulphuric acid and release ethanol:
:C2H5-O-SO3H + H2O → H2SO4 + C2H5OH 
This two step route is called the &quot;indirect process&quot;.

In the &quot;direct process,&quot; the acid protonates the alkene, and water reacts with this incipient carbocation to give the alcohol. The direct process is more popular because it is simpler. The acid catalysts include phosphoric acid and several solid acids.
Here an example reaction mechanism of the hydration of 1-methylcyclohexene to 1-methylcyclohexanol:

Many alternative routes are available for producing alcohols, including the hydroboration–oxidation reaction, the oxymercuration–reduction reaction, the Mukaiyama hydration, the reduction of ketones and aldehydes and as a biological method fermentation.

===Alkynes===
Acetylene hydrates to give acetaldehyde: The process typically relies on mercury catalysts and has been discontinued in the West but is still practiced in China. The Hg2+ center binds to a C≡C bond, which is then attacked by water. The reaction is
:H2O + C2H2 → CH3CHO

===Aldehydes and ketones===
Aldehydes and to some extent even ketones, hydrate to geminal diols. The reaction is especially dominant for formaldehyde, which, in the presence of water, exists significantly as dihydroxymethane.

Conceptually similar reactions include hydroamination and hydroalkoxylation, which involve adding amines and alcohols to alkenes.

===Nitriles===
Nitriles are susceptible to hydration to amides:

This reaction requires catalysts. Enzymes are used for the commercial production of acrylamide from acrylonitrile.

==Inorganic and materials chemistry==
Hydration is an important process in many other applications; one example is the production of Portland cement by the crosslinking of calcium oxides and silicates that is induced by water. Hydration is the process by which desiccants function.

<text>The Trưng sisters (, 𠄩婆徵, literally &quot;Two Ladies [named] Trưng&quot;, 
14 – c. 43) were Luoyue military leaders who ruled for three years after commanding a rebellion of Luoyue tribes and other tribes in AD 40 against the first Chinese domination of Vietnam. They are regarded as national heroines of Vietnam. Their names were Trưng Trắc (chữ Hán: ; Chinese pinyin: &quot;Zhēng Cè&quot;; Wade–Giles: &quot;Cheng1 Ts&#x27;e4&quot;; Old Chinese: &quot;*trəŋ-[ts]rək&quot;) and Trưng Nhị (chữ Hán: ; Chinese pinyin: &quot;Zhēng Èr &quot;; Wade–Giles: &quot;Cheng1 Erh4&quot;; Old Chinese: &quot;*trəŋni[j]-s&quot;). Trưng Trắc was the first female monarch in Vietnam, as well as the first queen in the history of Vietnam (Lý Chiêu Hoàng was the last woman to take the reign and is the only empress regnant), and she was accorded the title Queen Trưng (chữ Quốc ngữ: , chữ Hán: ) in the &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot;.

The sisters were born in Jiaozhi (Giao Chỉ), a commandery of the Chinese Han dynasty in modern-day northern Vietnam. The dates of their births are unknown, but Trưng Trắc was older than Trưng Nhị. The exact dates of their deaths are also unknown but both died around 43 AD after battling against the punitive expedition force led by Eastern Han general Ma Yuan.

==Historical background==
The former Qin commander Zhao Tuo (&quot;Trieu Da&quot; in Vietnamese) established the state of Nanyue in 204 BC and had conquered Âu Lạc in 180 BC, incorporating the Vietnamese realm into his own. In 112 BC, Emperor Wu of Han dispatched soldiers against Nanyue and the kingdom was annexed in 111 BC during the ensuing Han conquest of Nanyue. Nine commanderies were established to administer the region, three of which were located in what is now northern Vietnam. Revolts of local tribes against the Han began in 40 AD led by the Trưng sisters.

==Biography==

The Trưng sisters were daughters of a wealthy aristocratic family of Lạc ethnicity (The Lac were sorts of a confederation of multi-ethnic peoples). Their father had been a Lạc lord in Mê Linh district (modern-day Mê Linh District, Hanoi). Trưng Trắc&#x27;s husband was Thi Sách (Shi Suo), was also the Lạc lord of Chu Diên (modern-day Khoái Châu District, Hưng Yên Province). Su Ding, the Chinese governor of Jiaozhi province at the time, is remembered by his cruelty and tyranny. According to the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, Thi Sách was &quot;of a fierce temperament&quot;, and Su Ding attempted to restrain him with legal procedures, literally to behead him without trial. Trưng Trắc stirred her husband to action and became the central figure in mobilizing the Lạc lords against the Chinese. In March of 40 AD, Trưng Trắc and her younger sister Trưng Nhị, led the Lạc Việt to rise up in rebellion against the Han.

The &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; recorded that Trưng Trắc launched the rebellion to avenge the killing of her husband. It began at the Red River Delta, but soon spread to other Lạc and non-Han peoples from an area stretching from Hepu Commandery to Rinan. Chinese settlements were overrun, and Su Ding fled. The uprising gained the support of about sixty-five towns and settlements. Trưng Trắc was proclaimed as queen regnant. The status of Trưng Nhị was not mentioned in &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot;. According to &quot;Việt Nam sử lược&quot;, Trưng Nhị jointly reigned as co-king/queen but according to folk literature, Trưng Nhị became a vice-king/queen.

In 42 AD, the Emperor Guangwu of Han commissioned general Ma Yuan to suppress the rebellion with 20,000 troops. The rebellion of the two sisters was defeated in the next year as Ma Yuan captured and decapitated Trưng Trắc and Trưng Nhị, then sent their heads to the Han court in Luoyang.

The Song dynasty poet and calligrapher Huang Tingjian (1045–1105) compared the Trưng sisters to Lü Jia, the prime minister of Nanyue who resisted Emperor Wu&#x27;s army in 112 BCE:

Lü Jia refused treasonous bribe;Trưng Trắc raised her shield to resist oppression
==Historiography==

The primary historical source for the sisters is the 5th century &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; compiled by historian Fan Ye, which covers the history of the Eastern Han dynasty from 6 to CE 189. Other Chinese sources are the &quot;Shui Jing Zhu&quot; (6th cen), &quot;Book of Sui&quot; (7th century), &quot;Tongdian&quot; (8th century), &quot;Book of the Southern Barbarians&quot; (written in 862 by Fan Chuo)... The secondary source, but the primary popular source, is the &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; (Complete Annals of Dai Viet) compiled by Ngô Sĩ Liên under the order of the Emperor Lê Thánh Tông and finished in 1479.

===Chinese sources===
The Chinese traditional historical accounts on the Trưng sisters are remarkably brief. They are found in several different chapters of the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, the history for the Eastern Han dynasty, against which the Trưng sisters had carried out their uprising.

====Book of Later Han; 5th century AD====
Chapter eighty-six of the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;, entitled &quot;Biographies of the Southern and the Southwestern Barbarians,&quot; has this short passage:

In the 16th year of the Jianwu era (40 AD), Jiaozhi (交阯; WD: Chiao-chih) woman Zheng Ce (徵側; SV: Trưng Trắc) and her younger sister Zheng Er (徵貳; SV: Trưng Nhị) rebelled and attacked the commandery[&#x27;s strongholds]. As for Zheng Ce, she was the daughter of the Luo general of Miling prefecture (麊泠; SV: Mê Linh). She was married as wife to Shi Suo (詩索; SV: Thi Sách), a man in Zhouyuan (朱鳶; SV: Chu Diên). She/he(?) was/They were(?) remarkably heroic and courageous. Su Ding (蘇定; WD: Su Ting), the administrator of Jiaozhi restrained her (them?) with law; Ce became infuriated, rebelled, and attacked. Thus, the barbarians in Jiuzhen (九眞; WD Chiu-chen), Rinan (日南; WD:Jih-nan), Hepu (合浦; WD: Hop&#x27;u) all supported her. All in all, she took sixty-five strongholds and established herself as queen. Jiaozhi&#x27;s governor and administrators could but defend themselves. (Emperor) Guangwu thus decreed that Changsha (長沙; WD: Ch&#x27;ang-sha), Hepu, and Jiaozhi, all must furnish chariots and boats, repair roads and bridges, dredge obstructed waterways, and store foods and provisions. In the 18th year (42 CE), he dispatched Wave-Subduing General Ma Yuan (馬援; WD: Ma Yüan), Tower-ship General Duan Zhi (段志; WD: Tuan Chih) [and Household General Liu Long (劉隆; WD: Liu Long)], who led over 10,000 troops from Ch&#x27;ang-sha, Guiyang (桂陽; SV: Quế Dương); Lingling (零陵; SV: Linh Lăng); Cangwu (蒼梧; SV: Thương Ngô) on a punitive expedition. Summer next year (43 CE), in the fourth month, Ma Yuan devastated Jiaozhi, beheaded Zheng Ce, Zheng Er, and others; the rest all surrendered or scattered. He advanced and attacked the Jiuzhen&#x27;s rebel Du Yang (都陽; SV: Đô Dương) and others, routing and subduing them. He exiled over 300 rebel leaders to Lingling. Thus the regions beyond the Ridge were entirely pacified.

Chapter twenty-four, the biographies of Ma and some of his notable male descendants, had this parallel description:

Then Jiaozhi woman Zheng Ce and [her] younger sister Zheng Er rebelled; [they] attacked and the commandery was lost. The barbarians in Jiuzhen, Rinan, Hepu all supported [the Zheng sisters]. The rebels captured over sixty strongholds beyond the Ridge; Ce established herself as queen. Then a sealed decree honored Yuan as Wave-Subduing General, assigned Fule Marquis Liu Long as his assistant, dispatched Tower-ship general Duan Zhi, etc. southwards to attack Jiaozhi. When the army reached Hepu, Zhi fell ill and died; [the Emperor] decreed that Yuan command his [Zhi&#x27;s] soldiers also. Then [Yuan&#x27;s army] advanced along the coastline and the mountains, opening a path over thousands of li long. In the spring of the 18th [Jianwu] year (40 CE), [Yuan&#x27;s] army reached up to Langbo (浪泊; SV: Lãng Bạc), fought with the rebels, routed them, decapitated thousands, [and] over tens of thousands surrendered. Yuan chased Zheng Ce to the Forbidden Gorge (禁谿; SV: Cấm Khê); defeated many times, the rebels then scattered and fled. The first month of next year (43 CE), Zheng Ce and Zheng Er were beheaded, their heads sent to Luoyang. Yuan was enfeoffed as Marquis of Xinsi, [his] fief [containing] three-thousand households. Yuan then slaughtered oxen, and distilled wines, and rewarded the soldiers [and] officers [for their] hard work...

Yuan commanded over 2,000 tower-ships big and small, over 20,000 soldiers, advanced and attacked the bandit Zheng Ce&#x27;s remnants Du Yang (都羊, SV: Đô Dương) et al., from Wugong (無功; SV: Vô Công) to Jufeng (居風, SV: Cư Phong), beheading [or] capturing over 5,000; south of the mountains everywhere [was] pacified. Yuan reported that Xiyu prefecture (西於; SV: Tây Ư) had 32,000 households, its boundaries [were] over thousands of li from the court; he requested that [Xiyu prefecture] be divided into two prefectures: Fengxi (封溪, SV: Phong Khê) and Wanghai (望海; SV: Vọng Hải); [the request] was granted. Yuan immediately seized the momentum, established commanderies and prefectures, repaired the strongholds and ramparts, dredged the irrigation canals, and benefited the people. [Yuan] reported [to the Emperor] Yue law and Han law differed in more than ten rules; towards the Yue people, the old rules were clarified in order to restrain them. Henceforth, the Luoyue (駱越) obeyed General Ma&#x27;s laws.

Autumn of the 20th year (44 CE), [Ma Yuan] brought the troops back to the capital; the troops had been suffering from miasma and epidemic, four to five died out of ten. Yuan was bestowed a military carriage; in court-meetings, [he] ranked among the Nine Ministers.

====Records of Jiao Province&#x27;s Outer Territories, 4th century AD====
An older, yet less-known account, from the now-lost &quot;Records of Jiao Province&#x27;s Outer Territories&quot; (交州外域記) was quoted in the 6th-century word &quot;Commentary on the Water Classic&quot; (水經注) by Northern Wei geographer Li Daoyuan:

Later, the son of Zhouyuan&#x27;s Luo general, named Shi (詩; SV: Thi), asked the daughter of Ming ling&#x27;s Luo general, named Zheng Ce (徵側; SV: Trưng Trắc), to be his wife. Ce, as a human being, possessed mettle and courage. Alongsides Shi, she uprose and rebelled, attacking and devastating Jiao Province, as well as reducing the Luo generals into subordination. Zheng Ce made [herself] queen. Starting from Miling prefecture, she occupied two divisions Jiaozhi and Jiuzhen, and for two years taxed the people. Later on, the Han (court) dispatched Wave-Subduing General to lead troops on a punitive expedition. Ce and Shi fled into the Golden Gorge (金溪 SV; Kim Khê). Ma Yuan hunted them down and captured them after three years. Now [from] Western Shu [there were] also troops dispatched on punitive expedition against Ce and Shi and others and all those commanderies and prefectures were pacified; then magistrates were instituted there.

In the 9th month of 19th year of the Jianwu era [43 CE], Ma Yuan reported to the Emperor that: &#x27;I prudently added 12,000 crack-troops in Jiaozhi to the main army for a total of 20,000 men; as well as 2,000 vessels and vehicles, ever since entering Jiaozhi; now [our army] has become [even] stronger.&#x27; In the 10th month, Yuan [went] southwards and entered Jiuzhen; when he reached Vô Thiết prefecture (無切縣), the rebels&#x27; leader surrendered. He advanced and entered Dư Phát (餘發), rebels&#x27; leader Chu Bá (朱伯) abandoned the commandery and escaped into the deep jungles and great marshes where rhinoceroses and elephants gathered and goats and buffaloes numbered in the thousands; then, elephants were seen as in herds of several hundreds. Yuan again divided his troops, [and dispatched them] into Vô Biên prefecture (無編縣) – which was the Jiuzhending 九真亭 [prefecture] during Wang Mang[&#x27;s era]. When [Ma Yuan] reached Cư Phong (風縣), the [rebels&#x27;] leader did not surrender; [Ma Yuan] then beheaded several tens to hundreds. Jiuzhen was then pacified.

===Differences===

The traditional Chinese accounts differed from Vietnamese traditional accounts in many places: Chinese accounts do not indicate oppression of the Vietnamese population by the Chinese officials and Su Ding&#x27;s killing of Trưng Trắc&#x27;s husband; though Ma Yuan himself confirmed that Su Ding was greedy and cowardly. In the Chinese account, the Trưng sisters did not commit suicide. Chinese sources also contradicted accounts in Vietnamese folk history that the Trưng sisters&#x27; retainers followed their examples and also committed suicide.

====Excerpts from &quot;Complete Annals of Đại Việt&quot;, 1479====

The third book of &quot;Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư&quot; (&quot;Complete Annals of Dai Viet&quot;), published in editions between 1272 and 1697, has the following to say about the Trưng Sisters:

Lê Văn Hưu (Trần dynasty&#x27;s historian) wrote:
Ngô Sĩ Liên (the Complete Annals chief compiler) wrote:
==Cultural significance==

===Nationalism===
The Trưng Sisters are highly revered in Vietnam, as they led the first resistance movement against the occupying Chinese after 247 years of domination. Many temples are dedicated to them, and a yearly holiday in February to commemorate their deaths is observed by many Vietnamese. A central district in Hanoi called the Hai Bà Trưng District is named after them, as are numerous large streets in major cities and many schools. Their biographies are mentioned in children&#x27;s school books.

The stories of the Trưng Sisters and of another famous woman warrior, Lady Triệu, are cited by some historians as hints that Vietnamese society before sinicization was a matriarchal one, where there are no obstacles for women in assuming leadership roles.

Even though the Trưng Sisters&#x27; revolt against the Chinese was almost 2000 years ago, its legacy in Vietnam remains. The two sisters are considered to be a national symbol in Vietnam, representing Vietnam&#x27;s independence. They are often depicted as two women riding two giant war elephants. Many times, they are seen leading their followers into battle against the Chinese. The Trưng sisters were more than two sisters that gave their lives up for their country; they are powerful symbols of Vietnamese resistance and freedom.

In 1962 during the Vietnam War, Trần Lệ Xuân (aka Madame Nhu), sister-in-law of South Vietnamese president Ngô Đình Diệm had a costly statue erected in the capital of Saigon in memory of the Trưng sisters, with the facial features modeled on herself, and also established the Women&#x27;s Solidarity Movement, a female paramilitary organization, using the sisters as a rallying symbol. In the aftermath of the 1963 overthrow of Ngô Đình Diệm, the statues of the sisters were demolished by jubilant anti-Ngô Đình Diệm rioters.

===Temples===
Temples to the Trưng Sisters or Hai Bà Trưng Temples were found from as early as the end of the Third Era of Northern Domination. The best known Hai Bà Trưng Temple is in Hanoi near Hoàn Kiếm Lake. The temple was constructed by king Lý Anh Tông (r. 1138–1176) in 1158. According to tradition, in that year a devastating drought occurred in the Red River Delta, and the king ordered a Buddhist monk named Cam Thin to conduct a sacrifices rite and pray for rain at the Trung sisters temple. It rained the following day that saved his kingdom from famine. During one night the king dreamed and saw the two sisters appeared and were riding together on an iron horse. When the king awoke, he ordered the temple to be gloriously decorated and performed a sacrifice ritual to the sisters. Later he directed two other temples to worship the sisters, one of which was destroyed by river landslide and one temple which survives today. Other Hai Bà Trưng temples are found in Mê Linh District (Vĩnh Phúc Province), Phúc Thọ District (Hà Tây Province) and Hoàng Hoa Thám Street, Bình Thạnh District, Ho Chi Minh City.

===Women&#x27;s status===
According to Keith Taylor, one reason for the defeat is desertion by rebels because they did not believe they could win under a woman&#x27;s leadership. The fact that women were in charge was blamed as a reason for the defeat by historical Vietnamese texts in which the historians ridiculed and mocked men because they did nothing while &quot;mere girls&quot;, whom they viewed with revulsion, took up the banner of revolt. The historical poem containing the phrase &quot;mere girls&quot;, which related the revolt of the Trưng Sisters while the men did nothing, was not intended to praise women nor view war as women&#x27;s work, as it has been wrongly interpreted.

===Music===
Lưu Hữu Phước wrote the patriotic song &quot;Hát Giang trường hận&quot; (Long Hatred on Hát River) between 1942–1943 to dedicate to the Trưng sisters. Later, Phước revised the lyrics in 1946 to create another song (Soul of the Martyred Soldier), which is often used as lament for state funerals, and the lyrics still mentioned the Trưng sisters&#x27; rebellion.

=== Portrayal in Video Games ===
In &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VII&quot;, Trung Trac is a playable leader.

<text>A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other, bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a &quot;star cluster&quot; or &quot;galaxy&quot;, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets).

A star system of two stars is known as a &quot;binary star&quot;, &quot;binary star system&quot; or &quot;physical double star&quot;. If there are no tidal effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely. &quot;(See Two-body problem)&quot;. Examples of binary systems are Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole.

==Multiple star systems==
A multiple star system consists of two or more stars that appear from Earth to be close to one another in the sky. This may result from the stars actually being physically close and gravitationally bound to each other, in which case it is a &quot;physical&quot; multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an &quot;optical&quot; multiple star Physical multiple stars are also commonly called &quot;multiple stars&quot; or &quot;multiple star systems&quot;.

Most multiple star systems are &quot;triple stars&quot;. Systems with four or more components are less likely to occur. Multiple-star systems are called &quot;triple&quot;, &quot;ternary&quot;, or &quot;trinary&quot; if they contain 3 stars; &quot;quadruple&quot; or &quot;quaternary&quot; if they contain 4 stars; &quot;quintuple&quot; or &quot;quintenary&quot; with 5 stars; &quot;sextuple&quot; or &quot;sextenary&quot; with 6 stars; &quot;septuple&quot; or &quot;septenary&quot; with 7 stars; &quot;octuple&quot; or &quot;octenary&quot; with 8 stars. These systems are smaller than open star clusters, which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars. Most multiple star systems known are triple; for higher multiplicities, the number of known systems with a given multiplicity decreases exponentially with multiplicity. For example, in the 1999 revision of Tokovinin&#x27;s catalog of physical multiple stars, 551 out of the 728 systems described are triple. However, because of suspected selection effects, the ability to interpret these statistics is very limited.

Multiple-star systems can be divided into two main dynamical classes:
: (1) hierarchical systems, which are stable, and consist of nested orbits that do not interact much, and so each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a &quot;Two-body problem&quot;
or
: (2) the trapezia which have unstable strongly interacting orbits and are modelled as an &quot;n-body problem&quot;, exhibiting chaotic behavior. They can have 2, 3, or 4 stars.

==Hierarchical systems==
Most multiple-star systems are organized in what is called a &quot;hierarchical system&quot;: the stars in the system can be divided into two smaller groups, each of which traverses a larger orbit around the system&#x27;s center of mass. Each of these smaller groups must also be hierarchical, which means that they must be divided into smaller subgroups which themselves are hierarchical, and so on. Each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a &quot;two-body problem&quot; by considering close pairs as if they were a single star. In these systems there is little interaction between the orbits and the stars&#x27; motion will continue to approximate stable Keplerian orbits around the system&#x27;s center of mass, unlike the unstable trapezia systems or the even more complex dynamics of the large number of stars in star clusters and galaxies.

=== Triple star systems ===
In a &quot;physical&quot; triple star system, each star orbits the center of mass of the system. Usually, two of the stars form a close binary system, and the third orbits this pair at a distance much larger than that of the binary orbit. This arrangement is called &quot;hierarchical&quot;. The reason for this arrangement is that if the inner and outer orbits are comparable in size, the system may become dynamically unstable, leading to a star being ejected from the system. EZ Aquarii is an example of a physical hierarchical triple system, which has an outer star orbiting an inner physical binary composed of two more red dwarf stars.
Triple stars that are &quot;not&quot; all gravitationally bound might comprise a physical binary and an &quot;optical&quot; companion (such as Beta Cephei) or, in rare cases, a purely &quot;optical&quot; triple star (such as Gamma Serpentis).

===Higher multiplicities===
Hierarchical multiple star systems with more than three stars can produce a number of more complicated arrangements. These arrangements can be organized by what Evans (1968) called &quot;mobile diagrams&quot;, which look similar to ornamental mobiles hung from the ceiling. Examples of hierarchical systems are given in the figure to the right (&quot;Mobile diagrams&quot;). Each level of the diagram illustrates the decomposition of the system into two or more systems with smaller size. Evans calls a diagram &quot;multiplex&quot; if there is a node with more than two &quot;children&quot;, i.e. if the decomposition of some subsystem involves two or more orbits with comparable size. Because, as we have already seen for triple stars, this may be unstable, multiple stars are expected to be &quot;simplex&quot;, meaning that at each level there are exactly two &quot;children&quot;. Evans calls the number of levels in the diagram its &quot;hierarchy&quot;.

* A simplex diagram of hierarchy 1, as in (b), describes a binary system.

* A simplex diagram of hierarchy 2 may describe a triple system, as in (c), or a quadruple system, as in (d).
* A simplex diagram of hierarchy 3 may describe a system with anywhere from four to eight components. The mobile diagram in (e) shows an example of a quadruple system with hierarchy 3, consisting of a single distant component orbiting a close binary system, with one of the components of the close binary being an even closer binary.
* A real example of a system with hierarchy 3 is Castor, also known as Alpha Geminorum or α Gem. It consists of what appears to be a visual binary star which, upon closer inspection, can be seen to consist of two spectroscopic binary stars. By itself, this would be a quadruple hierarchy 2 system as in (d), but it is orbited by a fainter more distant component, which is also a close red dwarf binary. This forms a sextuple system of hierarchy 3.
* The maximum hierarchy occurring in A. A. Tokovinin&#x27;s Multiple Star Catalogue, as of 1999, is 4. For example, the stars Gliese 644A and Gliese 644B form what appears to be a close visual binary star; because Gliese 644B is a spectroscopic binary, this is actually a triple system. The triple system has the more distant visual companion Gliese 643 and the still more distant visual companion Gliese 644C, which, because of their common motion with Gliese 644AB, are thought to be gravitationally bound to the triple system. This forms a quintuple system whose mobile diagram would be the diagram of level 4 appearing in (f).

Higher hierarchies are also possible. Most of these higher hierarchies either are stable or suffer from internal perturbations. Others consider complex multiple stars will in time theoretically disintegrate into less complex multiple stars, like more common observed triples or quadruples are possible.

==Trapezia==

Trapezia are usually very young, unstable systems. These are thought to form in stellar nurseries, and quickly fragment into stable multiple stars, which in the process may eject components as galactic high-velocity stars. They are named after the multiple star system known as the Trapezium Cluster in the heart of the Orion Nebula. Such systems are not rare, and commonly appear close to or within bright nebulae. These stars have no standard hierarchical arrangements, but compete for stable orbits. This relationship is called &quot;interplay&quot;. Such stars eventually settle down to a close binary with a distant companion, with the other star(s) previously in the system ejected into interstellar space at high velocities. This dynamic may explain the runaway stars that might have been ejected during a collision of two binary star groups or a multiple system. This event is credited with ejecting AE Aurigae, Mu Columbae and 53 Arietis at above 200 km·s−1 and has been traced to the Trapezium cluster in the Orion Nebula some two million years ago.

==Designations and nomenclature==

===Multiple star designations===

The components of multiple stars can be specified by appending the suffixes &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, etc., to the system&#x27;s designation. Suffixes such as &quot;AB&quot; may be used to denote the pair consisting of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The sequence of letters &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, etc. may be assigned in order of separation from the component &quot;A&quot;. Components discovered close to an already known component may be assigned suffixes such as &quot;Aa&quot;, &quot;Ba&quot;, and so forth.

===Nomenclature in the Multiple Star Catalogue===
A. A. Tokovinin&#x27;s Multiple Star Catalogue uses a system in which each subsystem in a mobile diagram is encoded by a sequence of digits. In the mobile diagram (d) above, for example, the widest system would be given the number 1, while the subsystem containing its primary component would be numbered 11 and the subsystem containing its secondary component would be numbered 12. Subsystems which would appear below this in the mobile diagram will be given numbers with three, four, or more digits. When describing a non-hierarchical system by this method, the same subsystem number will be used more than once; for example, a system with three visual components, A, B, and C, no two of which can be grouped into a subsystem, would have two subsystems numbered 1 denoting the two binaries AB and AC. In this case, if B and C were subsequently resolved into binaries, they would be given the subsystem numbers 12 and 13.

===Future multiple star system nomenclature===

The current nomenclature for double and multiple stars can cause confusion as binary stars discovered in different ways are given different designations (for example, discoverer designations for visual binary stars and variable star designations for eclipsing binary stars), and, worse, component letters may be assigned differently by different authors, so that, for example, one person&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; can be another&#x27;s &quot;C&quot;. Discussion starting in 1999 resulted in four proposed schemes to address this problem:
* KoMa, a hierarchical scheme using upper- and lower-case letters and Arabic and Roman numerals;
* The Urban/Corbin Designation Method, a hierarchical numeric scheme similar to the Dewey Decimal Classification system;
* The Sequential Designation Method, a non-hierarchical scheme in which components and subsystems are assigned numbers in order of discovery; and
* WMC, the Washington Multiplicity Catalog, a hierarchical scheme in which the suffixes used in the Washington Double Star Catalog are extended with additional suffixed letters and numbers.
For a designation system, identifying the hierarchy within the system has the advantage that it makes identifying subsystems and computing their properties easier. However, it causes problems when new components are discovered at a level above or intermediate to the existing hierarchy. In this case, part of the hierarchy will shift inwards. Components which are found to be nonexistent, or are later reassigned to a different subsystem, also cause problems.

During the 24th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in 2000, the WMC scheme was endorsed and it was resolved by Commissions 5, 8, 26, 42, and 45 that it should be expanded into a usable uniform designation scheme. A sample of a catalog using the WMC scheme, covering half an hour of right ascension, was later prepared. The issue was discussed again at the 25th General Assembly in 2003, and it was again resolved by commissions 5, 8, 26, 42, and 45, as well as the Working Group on Interferometry, that the WMC scheme should be expanded and further developed.

The sample WMC is hierarchically organized; the hierarchy used is based on observed orbital periods or separations. Since it contains many visual double stars, which may be optical rather than physical, this hierarchy may be only apparent. It uses upper-case letters (A, B, ...) for the first level of the hierarchy, lower-case letters (a, b, ...) for the second level, and numbers (1, 2, ...) for the third. Subsequent levels would use alternating lower-case letters and numbers, but no examples of this were found in the sample.

==Examples==

===Binary===

* Sirius, a binary consisting of a main-sequence type A star and a white dwarf
* Procyon, which is similar to Sirius
* Mira, a variable consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf
* Delta Cephei, a Cepheid variable
* Almaaz, an eclipsing binary
* Spica

===Triple===

* Alpha Centauri is a triple star composed of a main binary Yellow dwarf and an Orange dwarf pair (Rigil Kentaurus and Toliman), and an outlying red dwarf, Proxima Centauri. Together, Rigil Kentaurus and Toliman form a physical binary star, designated as Alpha Centauri AB, α Cen AB, or RHD 1 AB, where the AB denotes this is a binary system. The moderately eccentric orbit of the binary can make the components be as close as 11 AU or as far away as 36 AU. Proxima Centauri, also (though less frequently) called Alpha Centauri C, is much farther away (between 4300 and 13,000 AU) from α Cen AB, and orbits the central pair with a period of 547,000 (+66,000/-40,000) years. 
* Polaris or Alpha Ursae Minoris (α UMi), the north star, is a triple star system in which the closer companion star is extremely close to the main star—so close that it was only known from its gravitational tug on Polaris A (α UMi A) until it was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2006.
* Gliese 667 is a triple star system with two K-type main sequence stars and a red dwarf. The red dwarf, C, hosts between two and seven planets, of which one, Cc, alongside the unconfirmed Cf and Ce, are potentially habitable.
* HD 188753 is a triple star system located approximately 149 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The system is composed of HD 188753A, a yellow dwarf; HD 188753B, an orange dwarf; and HD 188753C, a red dwarf. B and C orbit each other every 156 days, and, as a group, orbit A every 25.7 years.
* Fomalhaut (α PsA, α Piscis Austrini) is a triple star system in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. It was discovered to be a triple system in 2013, when the K type flare star TW Piscis Austrini and the red dwarf LP 876-10 were all confirmed to share proper motion through space. The primary has a massive dust disk similar to that of the early Solar System, but much more massive. It also contains a gas giant, Fomalhaut b. That same year, the tertiary star, LP 876-10 was also confirmed to house a dust disk.
* HD 181068 is a unique triple system, consisting of a red giant and two main-sequence stars. The orbits of the stars are oriented in such a way that all three stars eclipse each other.

===Quadruple===
* Capella, a pair of giant stars orbited by a pair of red dwarfs, around 42 light years away from the Solar System. It has an apparent magnitude of around 0.08, making Capella one of the brightest stars in the night sky.
* 4 Centauri
* Mizar is often said to have been the first binary star discovered when it was observed in 1650 by Giovanni Battista Riccioli, p. 1 but it was probably observed earlier, by Benedetto Castelli and Galileo. Later, spectroscopy of its components Mizar A and B revealed that they are both binary stars themselves.
* HD 98800
* The PH1 system has the planet PH1 b (discovered in 2012 by the Planet Hunters group, a part of the Zooniverse) orbiting two of the four stars, making it the first known planet to be in a quadruple star system.
*KOI-2626 is the first quadruple star system with an Earth-sized planet.
* Xi Tauri (ξ Tau, ξ Tauri), located about 222 light years away, is a spectroscopic and eclipsing quadruple star consisting of three blue-white B-type main-sequence stars, along with an F-type star. Two of the stars are in a close orbit and revolve around each other once every 7.15 days. These in turn orbit the third star once every 145 days. The fourth star orbits the other three stars roughly every fifty years.

===Quintuple===
* Dabih
* Mintaka
* HD 155448
* KIC 4150611

<text>Detective Inspector John Rebus is the protagonist in the Inspector Rebus series of detective novels by the Scottish writer Sir Ian Rankin, ten of which have so far been televised as &quot;Rebus&quot;. The novels are mostly set in and around Edinburgh. Rebus has been portrayed by John Hannah, Ken Stott and Richard Rankin for television, with Ron Donachie playing the character for the BBC Radio dramatisations.

==In the books==

In a series of books and short stories by Ian Rankin, beginning with &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; published in 1987 and ending with &quot;Exit Music&quot; in 2007, John Rebus is a detective in the Lothian and Borders Police force, stationed in Edinburgh. After the first book, he is promoted from Detective Sergeant to Detective Inspector. In novels published after his retirement at the end of &quot;Exit Music&quot;, Rebus continues to work with the Edinburgh police, either as a civilian or again as a police officer, but only in a temporary capacity.

===Backstory===

&quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; was originally written as a stand-alone, non-genre novel and presents the fullest portrait of Rebus as a literary character. He comes from Fife, where his parents are buried, and where his only sibling Michael still lives. His father made a living as a stage hypnotist and Michael is a success in the same profession. John is divorced from Rhona and has a daughter, Samantha, who is nearly twelve.

Rebus went from school into the army and after a difficult stint in Northern Ireland at the beginning of The Troubles, signed up for the SAS. There, he and another man were subjected to various kinds of torture in an attempt to see whether they would “break”. Rebus passed the test but, having had to abandon his companion, had a nervous breakdown himself. After recovering, he became a police detective. In &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot;, he suffers from PTSD (unnamed), which is cured when his brother hypnotizes him.

In subsequent novels, more about Rebus’s background is revealed. In the first few novels, Rebus likes jazz, but by the fourth one he admits to being partial to the Rolling Stones. From that point on, his favourite music is always folk and rock from his own and youth and that of the author. In &quot;Fleshmarket Close&quot;, which deals with immigrant trafficking, Rebus recalls that his paternal grandfather was a Polish immigrant. In &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, he recalls his school-leaving party in Cardenden, Fife (Rankin&#x27;s own home town) and his ill-fated plans to get a job and settle down with his childhood sweetheart.

Rebus lives in the flat he bought with his wife Rhona in the 1970s, on Arden Street in the Marchmont area. During his relationship with Patience Aitken he spends a lot of time at her flat and even rents his apartment out to students in &quot;The Black Book&quot;, though he has to move back in with them when Patience kicks him out. In &quot;The Falls&quot;, he has the flat rewired with an eye to selling it, but changes his mind. In &quot;A Song for the Dark Times&quot;, the garden flat in his own building has become vacant and he moves in as this will save him the difficult two-flight climb to his old flat.

Starting with &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, Rebus drives an older Saab 900. Before that, he had admired a Saab and wished he could afford one (in &quot;Strip Jack&quot;). In some of the later novels, he talks to the Saab, thanking it for making long trips, and he is relieved in &quot;A Song for the Dark Times&quot; when it can be repaired. In &quot;Even Dogs in the Wild&quot;, he acquires a dog, Brillo.

===Age===

As Rankin developed &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; into a series of crime stories, he allowed Rebus’s life to continue as if he were living in real time. Thus, in &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; (1987) his daughter Samantha is “nearly twelve” and in &quot;Tooth and Nail&quot; (1992) she is about sixteen. By the year 2000, Rankin was aware that Rebus was approaching 60, the age of compulsory retirement for police. Despite some indecision about Rebus’s actual age, Rankin settled on 1947 as the protagonist’s year of birth and 2007 as his year of retirement. More recently, since Rebus&#x27;s retirement, Rankin has admitted that the character is no longer ageing in real time and that he imagines Rebus as being in his late sixties in 2020, with some disabilities but still physically as well as mentally capable.

Although it is possible to summarize Rebus’s character and habits, he changes over the years. Early on, for example, he is ambitious, but as time goes by he sees that promotion would take him away from the hands-on investigative style he loves. To take another example, although his relationship with his daughter Samantha is a matter of rare phone calls for over a decade, they have more frequent visits after her daughter Carrie is born. In &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, his reflexive bullying of paedophiles in earlier books is gradually replaced by the realization that some of them, at least, have suffered abuse themselves.

===Character and habits===
John Lanchester, in an article written originally for the London Review of Books in 2000, says of Rebus,
Stubbornness is Rebus&#x27;s most deep-seated characteristic. All the various ways in which he could improve the quality of his life - which boil down essentially to his being less impossible - are somehow unthinkable. He stands in everybody else&#x27;s way, but he stands in his own way too: difficult, determined, remorseless, honourable, honest, and proud of his lack of charm. He is a deeply Scottish self-image….
Melanie McGrath, in a review of &quot;Even Dogs in the Wild,&quot; takes a slightly different view,
… an intensely romanticised, self-dramatising lone wolf, a kind of urban cowboy driven to detection as a means of resolving his existential crisis. As Rebus himself puts it, if justice didn’t matter, “then neither did he”.

Rebus loves to make jokes at the expense of others, especially his superiors and his friends. At times he even examines his own parting words, judging whether they were clever enough. He spars verbally with Siobhan Clarke but also with ‘Big Ger’ Cafferty.

Rebus&#x27;s sense of honour is questionable and he will lie to a witness swearing that “this is just between the two of us”, with no intention of keeping pertinent information private. He treats the criminal Cafferty’s influence and knowledge as a resource in his investigations and will sometimes do a favour for him. In Cafferty’s mind (and the minds of many others), Rebus belongs to him, but in Rebus’s own mind he is always fighting Cafferty and trying to collect evidence of his crimes.

Rebus is a heavy drinker and smoker, though always aware that this is bad for his health. He chooses to eat fried and/or fatty foods, knowing they are not good for him. His knowledge of Edinburgh bars and his appreciation of malt whiskies are encyclopaedic. Starting with &quot;Mortal Causes&quot;, his favourite hangout and meeting-place is the Oxford Bar, and from &quot;Exit Music&quot; to &quot;Rather Be the Devil&quot;, the ritual of going outside the bar to smoke is part of his routine. In &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, with the help of his old friend Jack Morton he stops drinking and is able to continue abstaining through the next book, &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot;. However, at the end of that novel Jack dies and Rebus resumes drinking. From one novel to another he may try to ration cigarettes, but he is not able to quit smoking entirely until he begins to suffer from COPD at the beginning of &quot;Rather Be the Devil&quot; — at that time he also begins to cut back on his drinking.

Music is important to Rebus, though he does not play an instrument himself. He has an extensive collection of vinyl, augmented when his brother Michael dies and leaves him records from their youth (&quot;The Naming of the Dead&quot;). It is not until &quot;Mortal Causes&quot;, however, that his love of rock and folk from the 1960s and 70s is firmly established. In &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;The Hanging Garden&quot;, and &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, Rebus’s stream of consciousness is sometimes presented as a series of song and album names, which both identify and dismiss his emotional reactions to a situation. Starting with &quot;Set in Darkness&quot;, he plays a game with Siobhan Clarke of reciting song names and expecting her to identify them. Clarke gives him newer music to listen to, and forms opinions about his favourites, too. In &quot;A Song for the Dark Times&quot;, she tells their friend Fox,
”John says he wants it put on his gravestone: ‘He listened to the B-sides.’” 
Books are important to him, but his interest tends to be aspirational; he struggles with the sense that he might (or might not) have done better if he had had better educational opportunities. Especially in the earlier novels, there are references to piles of unread books in his apartment, and to the fact that his wife Rhona, an English teacher, took many of the books originally in the apartment when she left him. Aside from &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, he doesn’t actually read much.

Rebus&#x27;s interest in politics is informed by a deep scepticism. Rankin considers him to be &quot;small-c conservative&quot; and therefore unlikely to support political change; at one point in &quot;Strip Jack&quot; (1992), he tells his friends Brian and Nell that he has only voted three times in his life, &quot;Once Labour, once SNP, and once Tory.&quot; On the other hand, when Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggested in a public venue that Rebus would have voted pro-Brexit, Rankin was taken aback.

Rebus’s romantic life is varied. He has occasional one-night stands (&quot;Knots and Crosses&quot;, &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, and &quot;Set in Darkness&quot;), but his more durable relationships are with women who have a superior education to him, including his wife Rhona, DI Gill Templar, Dr. Patience Aitken, the museum curator Jean Burchill, and Professor Deborah Quant. His experiments in living with a woman (Rhona, Patience) are not successful. He can never put a woman’s needs before those of his current case and he is usually the one who gets left or dismissed. In &quot;A Song for the Dark Times&quot;, he and Deborah Quant are satisfied with being “friends with benefits&quot;.

His most enduring relationship is with Siobhan Clarke, but its romantic expression peaks with a single kiss at the end of &quot;A Question of Blood&quot;. Starting with &quot;Set in Darkness&quot;, Clarke ceases to be a mere helper or sidekick and any erotic element needs to be suppressed in order to maintain this new relationship, which is important to both of them. In &quot;Set in Darkness&quot;, Rebus defends her from a stalker and in the 2002-2004 sequence, &quot;Resurrection Men&quot;, &quot;A Question of Blood&quot;, and &quot;Fleshmarket Close&quot;, he is explicitly compared to a knight. She is sometimes mistaken for his daughter and in &quot;A Song for the Dark Times&quot; performs the daughterly task of helping him move house.

Around the time of retirement, and during the pandemic lockdown especially, Rebus&#x27;s constant companion is a dog named Brillo. Brillo features prominently in A Heart Full of Headstones.

===Career===
Rebus’s early career must be retrospectively constructed from information in later books. 
* Some time before 1976, he joined the police and, after some training, started out as a Detective Constable. His mentor then was DI Laurence Geddes (&quot;Black and Blue&quot;), who retired around 1976 after the Spaven Case.
* In 1984, DC Rebus moved to the fictional Summerhall station, where DI Stefan Gilmour was his mentor until Gilmour resigned due to a scandal (&quot;Saints of the Shadow Bible&quot;).
* In 1987, DS Rebus is based at the fictional Great London Road station, where he stays until 1993.
* In 1991, DI Rebus is under Chief Superintendent Watson, who remains his superior officer until 1999 or so. 
* In 1992, Rebus is sent to assist the Metropolitan Police in London on a serial killer case.
* By 1993, the CID team from Great London Road is moved to the real-life station at St Leonard’s (&quot;The Black Book&quot;). This remains DI Rebus’s station until about 2004.
* In 1994, DI Rebus is assigned temporarily to the Crime Squad at the Fettes Avenue Police Headquarters (&quot;Mortal Causes&quot;).
* In 1996, DI Rebus is offered a promotion to DCI, but in a rural area — he asks that it be given to DI Flower, his rival and enemy, to get him out of Edinburgh (&quot;Let it Bleed&quot;).
* In 1997, DI Rebus is assigned temporarily to the rough neighbourhood station at Craigmillar. His involvement in the 1976 Spaven case is under investigation. 
* In 1998, DI Rebus is assigned to a committee to give advice on security for the new Scottish Parliament (&quot;Set in Darkness&quot;, 2000).
* In 2002, DI Rebus is sent on a course for difficult senior officers to keep them on track for their pensions, at Tulliallan Police College (&quot;Resurrection Men&quot;).
* From 2004-2007, DI Rebus and DS Clarke are assigned to the real-life Gayfield Square station. He is considered retirement age and is not welcome. 
* In November 2007, DI Rebus retires, as is mandatory at the age of 60.
* In &quot;Standing in Another Man’s Grave&quot; (2012) John Rebus is working for SCRU, a unit that examines unsolved cold cases.
* In &quot;Saints of the Shadow Bible&quot; (2013), due to a change in the retirement regulations, Rebus has become a DS again, assigned to Gayfield Square, where Clarke is now a DI. He is the subject of suspicion for his stint at Summerhall in the 1980s. 
* In novels after 2013, Rebus is definitively retired and his relationship with the police is at best that of a “Consulting Detective” (a la Sherlock Holmes) and at worst, an obnoxious pest.

As a policeman, Rebus develops into a maverick who keeps his investigations to himself as long as possible, but is relentless in using every means to solve a murder. He strives to build up as complete a picture as possible of the victims and suspects. Sometimes, he or others understand his obsessiveness as paranoia or conspiracy thinking, sometimes as solving a jigsaw puzzle. Early on, he is ambitious, but the role of Detective Inspector, in charge of a team but with considerable discretion to control an investigation, is not one he can trade for a more desk-bound and politically sensitive role.

He is also an example to others of the (bad) old-fashioned style of policeman. He is suspended from duties or asked to take a break in at least eight of the novels, usually for extreme insubordination or because he is literally trying to investigate his own past sins. In &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, Rebus is haunted by a case from 1976 in which his first police mentor framed a man for murder and Rebus lied on the witness stand to support him. In &quot;Saints of the Shadow Bible&quot; (2013), Rebus recalls his time in Summerhall police station in the 1980s, among violent and corrupt police officers who still, in 2013, have much to hide.

Rebus likes to improvise a team that will agree on the nature of justice and both allow and critique the methods he uses to pursue it. Brian Holmes, Siobhan Clarke, and Ellen Wylie are some of the young officers he recruits over the years. His main ally and sounding-board is Siobhan Clarke, introduced in 1993’s &quot;The Black Book&quot; and given a larger role starting in 2000’s &quot;Set in Darkness&quot;. She represents a new generation of policing, able to incorporate some of Rebus’s passion into a cooler, more even-handed style. Malcolm Fox, the protagonist of two of Rankin’s novels and, in the later ones, a colleague of Clarke and Rebus, is yet another style of policeman, intensely self-controlled and aware of the law. After a successful career monitoring police ethics in the “complaints” unit, he comes to sympathize with Rebus’s need to defy orders in his investigations.

===Historical observer===
Rebus’s long career tracks a number of developments from 1987 to the present:
* Changes in police structure, policy, and procedures in Scotland as oversight and, eventually, centralization affect the situation of police officers in their work.
* Changes in Edinburgh, including gentrification, the influx of immigrants, the construction of the Scottish parliament and its effects on the property market, the institution of one-way streets, and the lengthy attempt to construct the tramway.
* Scottish politics, including the establishment of a Scottish Parliament, and the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. Flashbacks and cold cases trigger memories of the 1979 referendum and the more violent period of partisanship that preceded it.
* The increasing reliance of the police (and also of everyday people) on data and electronic devices. Early on, computer screens and the HOLMES police database mystify Rebus (&quot;Black and Blue&quot;). When an email exchange is central to a case in &quot;The Falls&quot;, he lets his younger colleagues pursue that aspect of it. In &quot;A Question of Blood&quot;, he declares himself a “dinosaur” with respect to technology and literally smashes his cellphone when his call is not answered. In the same book, however, he gets hold of a laptop in order to view the webcam feed of a young, female cousin. Eventually though, he ends up relying on a mobile phone, texts, and search engines.

===Influences===
In his introduction to &quot;Rebus: The Early Years&quot;, Ian Rankin explains that part of the original inspiration for Rebus had to do with wanting to retell Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic horror story &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;, with Rebus as Jekyll threatened by his evil alter ego from the past. The Jekyll and Hyde theme is explicit in the first three novels, but reappears throughout the series, often expressed by Rebus to himself as the relationship between Edinburgh’s “overworld and underworld.” As John Lanchester noted in 2000, 
The aspect of the Jekyll and Hyde story which particularly interested Rankin was its portrayal of Edinburgh as a city of appearances and division, a place of almost structural hypocrisy.

Rebus can be said to belong to a long tradition of paternal Scottish hard men. A natural leader whose gruff exterior and fierce will to succeed in his field belies a benevolent nature. The character owes as much to the likes of Scottish football players Jock Stein and Bill Shankly as it does to a more obvious relation, the TV detective Jim Taggart. In an &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot; interview Rankin said that he drew &quot;some of his inspiration&quot; for the character from the &quot;sixth Stone&quot;, Ian Stewart. Three of the Inspector Rebus books are named after Stones albums: &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; and &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;.

==Other media==
===TV===
Plans were afoot in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s to bring Rebus to television in an adaptation of &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; with Leslie Grantham in the lead role, but this came to nothing. Ian Rankin believes that it was likely they would have made Rebus English or relocated the entire story to London. Rankin has revealed that the BBC were also keen to cast Robbie Coltrane as Rebus in a mooted adaptation of the series in the 1990s. Rankin &quot;smiled a bit&quot;, imagining flashbacks to Rebus&#x27;s SAS training with Private Robbie Coltrane running over the assault course!
In the &quot;Rebus&quot; television adaptations he was played by John Hannah in the first series, a casting decision into which Hannah felt he was forced. It was his production company behind the series and his original suggestion was Peter Mullan. However, he claimed the corporation would not commission a relatively unknown actor. In the later series, following Hannah and his production team&#x27;s exit, the role was taken over by Ken Stott.

A lot of Rebus&#x27;s character foibles are glossed over in the adaptations, for example his large LP collection and the frequent popular music references and thoughts that Ian Rankin weaves into the stories. However, Rebus&#x27;s reliance on alcohol is evident and he is often seen drinking in the Oxford Bar. Also, in the television series Rebus is portrayed as being a supporter of Hibernian (like Siobhan Clarke). This is not found in Ian Rankin&#x27;s books and the author has stated that Rebus is a Raith Rovers supporter. Rebus&#x27;s Fife accent is softened as well — in the novel &quot;Tooth and Nail&quot;, London Metropolitan Police colleagues find it difficult to understand his speech.

In November 2022, it was announced that Nordic streaming service Viaplay would produce a new Rebus adaptation, as the company&#x27;s debut UK production. In March 2023, Richard Rankin was announced, to star as Rebus. Following Viaplay&#x27;s decision to withdraw from the UK market, the production was acquired by the BBC. Episode 1 of the new series was aired on BBCiPlayer and BBCScotland on 17 May 2024, and on BBCOne on 18th May 2024.

===BBC Radio===
Alexander Morton played Rebus in a 1999 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;.

Ron Donachie starred as Rebus in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s dramatizations of &quot;The Falls&quot; (2008), &quot;Resurrection Men&quot; (2008), &quot;Strip Jack&quot; (2010), &quot;The Black Book&quot; (2012), &quot;Black and Blue&quot; (2013) and &quot;Rebus Set in Darkness&quot; (2014).

BBC Radio has also broadcast abridged readings of some novels, including &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; (read by Alexander Morton), of the novella &quot;Death Is Not the End&quot; (read by Douglas Henshall) and of the short story &quot;Facing the Music&quot; from &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; (read by James MacPherson).

===Stage===
Rankin, with Rona Munro, wrote the stage play &quot;&quot; which premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in September 2018 with Northern Irish actor Charles Lawson playing Rebus. Ron Donachie, who had frequently played the character for BBC Radio, took over the role for the 2019 run after Lawson suffered a minor stroke.

Rankin has since written a second play with Simon Reade. Entitled &quot;Rebus: A Game Called Malice&quot;, the production was premiered at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch on 2 February 2023 with John Michie playing Rebus. A new production of the play will be performed at the Festival Theatre, Edinburgh in September 2024, with Gray O&#x27;Brien as Rebus.

===Short film===
In May 2020, Brian Cox played an older Rebus in the short film &quot;John Rebus: The Lockdown Blues&quot; for BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Scenes for Survival&quot;, which is set in a locked down Edinburgh during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was written by Ian Rankin for the National Theatre of Scotland.

<text>Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library is an American estate and museum in Winterthur, Delaware. Winterthur houses one of the richest collections of Americana in the United States. The museum and estate were the home of Henry Francis du Pont (1880–1969), Winterthur&#x27;s founder and a prominent antiques collector and horticulturist.

== History ==

=== Estate ===
The property where Winterthur sits was purchased by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont (E. I. du Pont) between 1810 and 1818 and was used for farming and sheep-raising. In 1837, E. I du Pont&#x27;s heirs sold 445 acres of the land to E. I.&#x27;s business partner from France, Jacques Antoine Bidermann (1790–1865), and his wife Evelina Gabrielle du Pont (1796–1863) for the purpose of establishing their estate. Evelina was the second daughter of E. I. Du Pont&#x27;s seven children. Between 1839 and 1842, the couple built a 12-room Greek revival manor house on the property and named their estate Winterthur after Bidermann&#x27;s ancestral home in Winterthur, Switzerland. The Bidermanns added expansive gardens, livestock, and pastures.

After Bidermann&#x27;s death, the property passed to his son, James Irénée, who then sold it to his uncle, Henry du Pont. Henry purchased the property for his son, Henry Algernon du Pont. Henry Algernon and his wife, (Mary) Pauline, settled at Winterthur in 1876 and enlarged the estate&#x27;s existing home. Upon his father&#x27;s 1889 death, Henry Algernon officially inherited the property and converted its main home to a French-style manor house. Between 1885 and 1925, Henry Algernon and Pauline added 900 acres to the property, which included pastures for Holstein cattle. After Pauline&#x27;s 1902 death and the election of Henry Algernon to Congress, their son, Henry Francis (H. F.) du Pont, took over management of the estate.

H. F. married Ruth Wales in 1916. In 1923, the couple traveled to Vermont to study the cattle-breeding operation of William Seward Webb. During the trip, they visited the home of Webb&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Electra Havemeyer Webb, a collector of American decorative arts. H. F. later stated that this was when he became interested in collecting American antiques. During the same trip, the du Ponts also visited interior decorator Henry Davis Sleeper. Sleeper&#x27;s home was decorated with American antiques and interiors taken from other homes. This, too, inspired H .F. to start his own collection of Americana.

Henry Algernon died at the end of 1926, and Henry Francis du Pont officially inherited Winterthur in 1927. At the time, the estate consisted of 90 buildings and more than 2,600 acres. H. F. and Ruth renovated Winterthur&#x27;s manor, tripling its size. They outfitted the home with architectural elements salvaged from 17th, 18th, and 19th century American homes in the region, including wood interior paneling from the Grahame House, Belle Isle, and Mordington. Rooms in the home were themed by time period.

=== Museum ===
Winterthur has been called the &quot;largest and richest museum of American furniture and decorative arts in the world.&quot; It was formerly known as Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum and as the Winterthur Museum and Country Estate. H. F. established the main mansion as a public museum for American decorative arts in 1951 and moved to a smaller house on the estate. By 1959, the museum had been expanded to accommodate a library, lecture halls, and additional period rooms. By the time of his death in 1969, H. F. had amassed a collection of between 50,000 and 70,000 objects. This includes rare silver from Marquand and Co.

The museum comprises several buildings. In 1969, a large building that houses the library and conservation facilities was dedicated in honor of H. F.&#x27;s sister, a noted historic preservationist, and named the Louise du Pont Crowninshield Research Building. A pavilion building, separate from the main house, was built in the 1960s to welcome growing crowds. The visitor center consisted of a cafeteria and museum shop along with an adjacent parking lot. In 1992, additional galleries opened in a new building adjacent to the main house. The galleries host special rotating and permanent exhibits.

In 1987, Winterthur assistant curator Phillip H. Curtis was sentenced to a 7-year suspended prison sentence for stealing museum artifacts (ceramics, candlesticks, and other American decorative arts) worth $75,000. Curtis sold the stolen items to art dealers to fund his lavish lifestyle. In 1991, John Quentin Feller, a professor at the University of Scranton and authority on Chinese export ceramics, attempted to steal a Chinese serving platter from Winterthur, part of a series of thefts of 100 objects from 8 museums over 18 years. Feller was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison.

=== Directors ===
Winterthur Museum has been led by eleven executive directors since its founding: Joseph Downs (1951–1954), Charles Franklin Montgomery (1954–1961), Edgar Preston Richardson (1962–1966), Charles van Ravenswaay (1966–1976), James Morton Smith (1976–1984), Thomas Ashley Graves Jr. (1985–1992), Dwight Lanmon (1992–1999), Leslie Greene Bowman (1999–2008), David Roselle (2008–2018), Carol Cadou (2018–2021), and Chris Strand (2021–present). The current Charles F. Montgomery Director and CEO of Winterthur is Chris Strand, who previously served as Winterthur&#x27;s Brown Harrington Director of Garden and Estate and as interim CEO in the months following Cadou&#x27;s departure.

== Present day ==
=== Museum ===
Winterthur is located in northwestern Delaware, six miles north of Wilmington on Delaware Route 52. The museum and estate are situated on , near Brandywine Creek, with of naturalistic gardens.

The museum contains 175 period-room displays and approximately 90,000 objects. Most rooms are open to the public on small, guided tours. The collection spans more than two centuries of American decorative arts, notably from 1640 to 1860, and contains some of the most important pieces of American furniture and fine art.

In 2002, the National Gallery of Art hosted a guest exhibition of 300 objects curated by Winterthur staff. &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; filmed the first three episodes of its 24th season at Winterthur in 2019.

=== Library ===
Established in 1952, the Winterthur Library holds more than 87,000 rare books and over 800,000 manuscripts and images. The Winterthur Library is free and open to the public by appointment. Holdings include rare books, periodicals, trade catalogs, manuscripts, ephemera, photographs, slides, paper art, the archives of the Winterthur estate and museum, and other resources that support the needs of researchers in American history, decorative arts, architecture, horticulture, and other subjects. The Joseph Downs Collection of Manuscripts and Printed Ephemera was established in 1955, and the Waldron Phoenix Belknap Jr. Research Library of American Painting was formed circa 1956. The Winterthur Archives, which includes many of the du Pont family&#x27;s personal papers, Winterthur estate records, and H. F.&#x27;s history of collecting, was formed in 1969 after H. F.&#x27;s death.

The library&#x27;s origins go back to Pierre Samuel du Pont, the family patriarch, who collected 8,000 books before his death in 1817. Ensuing generations of the family continued to grow the collection, with Henry Francis du Pont avidly acquiring rare books for display, particularly 17th-century and 18th-century books with old binding. By the 1940s, H. F. was building a scholarly research collection as part of his plan to transform Winterthur into a museum and teaching institution. Frank Sommer, the first library director, and museum curator Charles F. Montgomery intensified collection development ahead of the 1952 launch of Winterthur&#x27;s first graduate program, in partnership with the University of Delaware. In 1969, the library moved from the main museum to the Crowninshield Research Building, which also houses extensive conservation, research, and education facilities.

=== Gardens and grounds ===
H. F. du Pont, a horticulturalist, began managing the estate&#x27;s grounds in 1909. He contracted a landscape architect, Marian Cruger Coffin, to assist with the design of 70 acres of the estate&#x27;s gardens and a model 2400-acre farm. The estate had twelve temperature controlled greenhouses, a 23-acre orchard, a 5.5-acre vegetable garden, and a 4-acre cutting garden. It also had a butcher shop, a saw mill, a tannery, and a dairy where H. F. continued to breed and raise award-winning Holstein cattle. There are at least 6 garden follies throughout the grounds, which were featured in an exhibition that ran from 2018 to 2020. A narrated tram ride through the gardens is available from March through December.

One of the sources who inspired the landscaping at Winterthur was William Robinson, whose book &quot;The Wild Garden&quot;, published in 1870, recommended mixing large groupings of hardy plantings in natural landscapes. The colors of the plantings have been carefully selected, featuring hundreds of species and hybrid varieties of rhododendrons and azaleas, as well as peonies, forsythia, daffodils, lilacs, mountain laurel, and dogwood. The grounds also offer a pinetum with various types of conifers, such as firs, spruce and hemlocks.

Chandler Farm, a Federal-style historic house on the Winterthur grounds, is used as the home for the director and chief executive of Winterthur.

In 1991, Winterthur began offering paid internships for aspiring horticulturists and stewards of natural lands, who can reside temporarily on the Estate.

In 2002, Winterthur donated a conservation easement on its acreage to the Brandywine Conservation Trust, ensuring that the land would never be developed.

=== Graduate programs ===
Winterthur and the University of Delaware jointly founded and continue to offer two master&#x27;s degree programs in American material culture (established in 1952 by museum director Charles F. Montgomery) and art conservation (established in 1974). As of August 1998, the programs had graduated 580 students, including 209 from the conservation program, which is one of only five graduate programs in the field in North America. The program is open to international students. The National Endowment for the Humanities has funded the program since 1974. Alumni include artists, curators, and scholars such as Wendell Garrett, Lorraine Waxman Pearce, Jessica Nicoll, Margaret Honda, Debra Hess Norris, and Charles L. Venable.

Winterthur offers residential, short-term, and remote fellowships, including postdoctoral, dissertation, and artist fellowships, to support researchers using the collections.

=== Journal ===
Since 1964, Winterthur has published a peer-reviewed interdisciplinary journal entitled &quot;Winterthur Portfolio: A Journal of American Material Culture&quot; and distributed by the University of Chicago Press. The journal is indexed in the MLA International Bibliography, Scopus, Web of Science, and other research databases.

<text>The Hagley Museum and Library is a nonprofit educational institution in unincorporated New Castle County, Delaware, near Wilmington. Covering more than along the banks of the Brandywine Creek, the museum and grounds include the first du Pont family home and garden in the United States, the powder yards, and a 19th-century machine shop. On the hillside below the mansion lies a Renaissance Revival garden, with terraces and statuary, created in the 1920s by Louise Evelina du Pont Crowninshield (1877–1958).

== History ==
In 1802, French immigrant Éleuthère Irénée du Pont founded black powder mills on the banks of Brandywine Creek after purchasing the property in 1801 for $6,700. He chose the location for the river&#x27;s tumble over the Fall Line which provided power, timber and willow trees (used to produce quality charcoal required for superior black powder), the proximity to the Delaware River (on which other ingredients of the powder – sulfur and saltpeter – could be shipped); and the quarries of gneiss that would provide construction materials for the mills. The E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company&#x27;s black powder factory became the largest in the world.

In 1921, the mills along the Brandywine closed and parcels of the property were sold. Plans for a museum were established 31 years later, on the occasion of the DuPont Company&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 1952.

=== Origin of the name ===
Hagley historians only know that the name was already in use well before E.I. du Pont expanded downstream from Eleutherian Mills in 1813 by purchasing the land that became the Hagley Yards. An 1813 document refers to the land as Hagley and it had been called Hagley as early as 1797, when its owner, Philadelphia Quaker merchant Rumford Dawes, applied for insurance on buildings that were said to be located in a place called Hagley on the Brandywine. Dawes had acquired the property in 1783. Since the name Hagley did not appear on the documents transferring ownership at that time, it seems likely that Dawes gave this name to the Brandywine location.

It seems likely that Delaware&#x27;s Hagley was named for an English estate, Hagley Hall that was well known in the second half of the eighteenth century. It is likely that Dawes chose the name based on an English narrative poem entitled &quot;The Seasons&quot; by James Thomson. Hagley Hall was the seat of Thomson&#x27;s patron the Baron Lyttelton, and the poem&#x27;s description of a sylvan dale is strikingly reminiscent of the Brandywine Valley. &quot;The Seasons&quot; was popular in Philadelphia at the time that Rumford Dawes acquired and named Hagley. The English Hagley estate is located in the West Midlands countryside about ten miles southwest of Birmingham. Perhaps coincidentally, Delaware&#x27;s Hagley is about 8 miles south of Chadds Ford Township, officially known as Birmingham Township before 1996.

At about the same time, Hagley Plantation on the Waccamaw River in South Carolina got its name when the owners, who were admirers of English culture, chose the name Hagley to remind them of the well-known parkland of that name near London.

==Operations==
Opened in 1957, the Hagley Museum features exhibits and demonstrations that show the connections between early industrial technology and early American history, focusing on the histories of the du Pont family, DuPont company, explosives and gunpowder, and innovation (through a large collection of American Patent models). There are indoor and outdoor exhibitions, along with restored mills, a workers community, and the original home of the du Pont family with an attached garden.

The Museum also explores personal stories of the 19th-century DuPont Company employees, how they lived, and how their lifestyles changed along with new machinery and new production methods. Visitors can ride a narrated bus tour, through the Powder Yard Trail and is the only way to the home.

== Library ==
The Eleutherian Mills Historical Library was dedicated on October 7, 1961. It was renamed as the Hagley Library in 1984.

Hagley&#x27;s library houses a major research collection of manuscripts, archives, photographs, pamphlets, and books documenting the history of American business and technology. A member of the Independent Research Libraries Association, the library serves scholars from this country and abroad. Holdings include 37,000 linear feet in the Manuscripts and Archives Department, 290,000 printed volumes in the Imprints Department, 2 million visual items in the Pictorial Department, and more than 300,000 digital images and pages in the Digital Archives Department. The library and archival collections owned by Hagley are open to the public for research; a catalog and partial digital archive are available online.

The library includes the Center for the History of Business, Technology, and Society, which coordinates Hagley&#x27;s interactions with the world of scholarship in the fields of American economic, business, and technological history. The center offers a scholar-in-residence program and competitive fellowships. It also hosts the Business History Conference, the largest US-based professional organization of business historians, and the editorial office of the peer-reviewed journal, &quot;Enterprise &amp; Society.&quot;

== E. I. du Pont residence complex ==
On the property is the home of Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, who built the Georgian-style home and surrounding buildings and gardens to serve as a center for familial and business life. The home was inhabited by five generations of the du Pont family, with many pieces of furniture, American folk art, and family pieces brought from France still on view. Other buildings that are a part of the complex are a barn, the &quot;First Office&quot; of the company, Lammot du Pont Workshop, and the garden.

The estate home was the first residence of the du Pont family in the United States.

== Grounds and plants ==
Located on the property are multiple national and state ranked trees. One, an Osage orange tree, was named a Co-National Champion Tree in 2011 and featured in the Delaware Forestry Service&#x27;s &quot;Big Trees of Delaware&quot; but was partially felled by a storm in August 2020. The tree was speculated to have been over 300 years old or planted via seeds brought back from the Lewis and Clark expedition. Two other trees felled during the storm were state champions, including a 90-foot tall sugar maple and a 62-foot tall shingle oak.

== Depiction in media ==
The Museum was featured on &quot;Mysteries at the Museum&quot; television show.

<doc id="240971" wikidata="Q9296153" url="?curid=240971" title="Halogen addition reaction">
<text>A halogen addition reaction is a simple organic reaction where a halogen molecule is added to the carbon–carbon double bond of an alkene functional group.

The general chemical formula of the halogen addition reaction is:

:C=C + X2 → X−C−C−X

(X represents the halogens bromine or chlorine, and in this case, a solvent could be CH2Cl2 or CCl4). The product is a vicinal dihalide.

This type of reaction is a halogenation and an electrophilic addition.

==Reaction mechanism==
The reaction mechanism for an alkene bromination can be described as follows. In the first step of the reaction, a bromine molecule approaches the electron-rich alkene carbon–carbon double bond. The bromine atom closer to the bond takes on a partial positive charge as its electrons are repelled by the electrons of the double bond.

The atom is electrophilic at this time and is attacked by the pi electrons of the alkene [carbon–carbon double bond]. It forms for an instant a single sigma bond to &quot;both&quot; of the carbon atoms involved. The bonding of bromine is special in this intermediate, due to its relatively large size compared to carbon, the bromide ion is capable of interacting with both carbons which once shared the π-bond, making a three-membered ring. The bromide ion acquires a positive formal charge. At this moment the halogen ion is called a &quot;bromonium ion&quot; or &quot;chloronium ion&quot;, respectively.

When the first bromine atom attacks the carbon–carbon π-bond, it leaves behind one of its electrons with the other bromine that it was bonded to in Br2. That other atom is now a negative bromide anion and is attracted to the slight positive charge on the carbon atoms. It is blocked from nucleophilic attack on one side of the carbon chain by the first bromine atom and can only attack from the other side. As it attacks and forms a bond with one of the carbons, the bond between the first bromine atom and the other carbon atoms breaks, leaving each carbon atom with a halogen substituent.

In this way the two halogens add in an &quot;anti&quot; addition fashion, and when the alkene is part of a cycle the dibromide adopts the &quot;trans&quot; configuration. For maximum overlap of the C–Br σ* antibonding molecular orbital (the LUMO, shown to the right in red) and the nucleophile (X−) lone pair (the HOMO, shown to the right below in green), X− must attack the bromonium ion from behind, at carbon.

This reaction mechanism was proposed by Roberts and Kimball in 1937. With it they explained the observed stereospecific &quot;trans&quot;-additions in brominations of maleic acid and fumaric acid. Maleic acid with a &quot;cis&quot;-double bond forms the dibromide as a mixture of enantiomers:

while the &quot;trans&quot;-isomer fumaric acid forms a single &quot;meso&quot; compound:

The reaction is even stereospecific in alkenes with two bulky &quot;tert&quot;-butyl groups in a &quot;cis&quot; position as in the compound &quot;cis&quot;-di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylethylene. Despite the steric repulsion present in the chloronium ion, the only product formed is the &quot;anti&quot;-adduct.

==β-Halocarbocations==
In an alternative reaction scheme depicted below the reactive intermediate is a β-bromocarbocation or β-bromocarbonium ion with one of the carbon atoms a genuine carbocation.

For reactions taking place through this mechanism no stereospecificity is expected and indeed not found.

Roberts and Kimball in 1937 already accounted for the fact that brominations with the maleate ion resulted in &quot;cis&quot;-addition driven by repulsion between the negatively charged carboxylic acid anions being stronger than halonium ion formation. In alkenes such as anetholes and stilbenes the substituents are able to stabilize the carbocation by donating electrons at the expense of the halonium ion.

Halonium ions can be identified by means of NMR spectroscopy. In 1967 the group of George A. Olah obtained NMR spectra of tetramethylethylenebromonium ions by dissolving 2,3-dibromo-2,3-dimethylbutane in magic acid at −60 °C. The spectrum for the corresponding fluorine compound on the other hand was consistent with a rapidly equilibrating pair of β-fluorocarbocations.

<doc id="240972" wikidata="Q131468" url="?curid=240972" title="White hole">
<text>In general relativity, a white hole is a hypothetical region of spacetime and singularity that cannot be entered from the outside, although energy-matter, light and information can escape from it. In this sense, it is the reverse of a black hole, from which energy-matter, light and information cannot escape. White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes. In addition to a black hole region in the future, such a solution of the Einstein field equations has a white hole region in its past. This region does not exist for black holes that have formed through gravitational collapse, however, nor are there any observed physical processes through which a white hole could be formed.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are theoretically predicted to be at the center of every galaxy and may be essential for their formation. Stephen Hawking and others have proposed that these supermassive black holes could spawn supermassive white holes.

==Overview==
Like black holes, white holes have properties such as mass, charge, and angular momentum. They attract matter like any other mass, but objects falling towards a white hole would never actually reach the white hole&#x27;s event horizon (though in the case of the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution, discussed below, the white hole event horizon in the past becomes a black hole event horizon in the future, so any object falling towards it will eventually reach the black hole horizon). Imagine a gravitational field, without a surface. Acceleration due to gravity is the greatest on the surface of any body. But since black holes lack a surface, acceleration due to gravity increases exponentially, but never reaches a final value as there is no considered surface in a singularity.

In quantum mechanics, the black hole emits Hawking radiation and so it can come to thermal equilibrium with a gas of radiation (not compulsory). Because a thermal-equilibrium state is time-reversal-invariant, Stephen Hawking argued that the time reversal of a black hole in thermal equilibrium results in a white hole in thermal equilibrium (each absorbing and emitting energy to equivalent degrees). Consequently, this may imply that black holes and white holes are reciprocal in structure, wherein the Hawking radiation from an ordinary black hole is identified with a white hole&#x27;s emission of energy and matter. Hawking&#x27;s semi-classical argument is reproduced in a quantum mechanical AdS/CFT treatment, where a black hole in anti-de Sitter space is described by a thermal gas in a gauge theory, whose time reversal is the same as itself.

==History==
In the 1930s, physicists Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder introduced the idea of white holes as a solution to Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity. These equations, the foundation of modern physics, describe the curvature of spacetime due to massive objects. Whereas black holes are born from the collapse of stars, white holes represent the theoretical birth of space, time, and potentially even universes. At the center, space and time do not end into a singularity, but continue across a short transition region where the Einstein equations are violated by quantum effects. From this region, space and time emerge with the structure of a white hole interior, a possibility already suggested by John Lighton Synge.

The possibility of the existence of white holes was put forward by cosmologist Igor Novikov in 1964, developed by Nikolai Kardashev. White holes are predicted as part of a solution to the Einstein field equations known as the maximally extended version of the Schwarzschild metric describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, &quot;maximally extended&quot; implies that spacetime should not have any &quot;edges&quot;. For any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a geodesic) in spacetime, it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle&#x27;s future, unless the trajectory hits a gravitational singularity like the one at the center of the black hole&#x27;s interior. In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the event horizon from the outside, there must be a separate white hole interior region, which allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up &quot;away&quot; from the event horizon. For an observer outside using Schwarzschild coordinates, infalling particles take an infinite time to reach the black hole horizon infinitely far in the future, while outgoing particles that pass the observer have been traveling outward for an infinite time since crossing the white hole horizon infinitely far in the past (however, the particles or other objects experience only a finite proper time between crossing the horizon and passing the outside observer). The black hole/white hole appears &quot;eternal&quot; from the perspective of an outside observer, in the sense that particles traveling outward from the white hole interior region can pass the observer at any time, and particles traveling inward, which will eventually reach the black hole interior region can also pass the observer at any time.

Just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different &quot;universes&quot;, with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black-hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white-hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates (see figure).

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with coordinate systems such that if you pick a hypersurface of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a space-like separation, giving what is called a &#x27;space-like surface&#x27;) and draw an &quot;embedding diagram&quot; depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an &quot;Einstein-Rosen bridge&quot; or Schwarzschild wormhole. Depending on where the space-like hypersurface is chosen, the Einstein-Rosen bridge can either connect two black hole event horizons in each universe (with points in the interior of the bridge being part of the black hole region of the spacetime), or two white hole event horizons in each universe (with points in the interior of the bridge being part of the white hole region). It is impossible to use the bridge to cross from one universe to the other, however, because it is impossible to enter a white hole event horizon from the outside, and anyone entering a black hole horizon from either universe will inevitably hit the black hole singularity.

Note that the maximally extended Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole/white hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole&#x27;s history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region. But because the equations of general relativity are time-reversible – they exhibit Time reversal symmetry – general relativity must also allow the time-reverse of this type of &quot;realistic&quot; black hole that forms from collapsing matter. The time-reversed case would be a white hole that has existed since the beginning of the universe, and that emits matter until it finally &quot;explodes&quot; and disappears. Despite the fact that such objects are permitted theoretically, they are not taken as seriously as black holes by physicists, since there would be no processes that would naturally lead to their formation; they could exist only if they were built into the initial conditions of the Big Bang. Additionally, it is predicted that such a white hole would be highly &quot;unstable&quot; in the sense that if any small amount of matter fell towards the horizon from the outside, this would prevent the white hole&#x27;s explosion as seen by distant observers, with the matter emitted from the singularity never able to escape the white hole&#x27;s gravitational radius.

==Properties==
Depending on the type of black hole solution considered, there are several types of white holes. In the case of the Schwarzschild black hole mentioned above, a geodesic coming out of a white hole comes from the &quot;gravitational singularity&quot; it contains. In the case of a black hole possessing an electric charge ψ ** Ώ ** ώ (Reissner-Nordström black hole) or an angular momentum, then the white hole happens to be the &quot;exit door&quot; of a black hole existing in another universe. Such a black hole – white hole configuration is called a wormhole. In both cases, however, it is not possible to reach the region &quot;in&quot; the white hole, so the behavior of it – and, in particular, what may come out of it – is completely impossible to predict. In this sense, a white hole is a configuration according to which the evolution of the universe cannot be predicted, because it is not deterministic. A &quot;bare singularity&quot; is another example of a non-deterministic configuration, but does not have the status of a white hole, however, because there is no region inaccessible from a given region. In its basic conception, the Big Bang can be seen as a naked singularity in outer space, but does not correspond to a white hole.

==Physical relevance==
In its mode of formation, a black hole comes from a residue of a massive star whose core contracts until it turns into a black hole. Such a configuration is not static: we start from a massive and extended body which contracts to give a black hole. The black hole therefore does not exist for all eternity, and there is no corresponding white hole.

To be able to exist, a white hole must either arise from a physical process leading to its formation, or be present from the creation of the universe. None of these solutions appears satisfactory: there is no known astrophysical process that can lead to the formation of such a configuration, and imposing it from the creation of the universe amounts to assuming a very specific set of initial conditions which has no concrete motivation.

In view of the enormous quantities radiated by quasars, whose luminosity makes it possible to observe them from several billion light-years away, it had been assumed that they were the seat of exotic physical phenomena such as a white hole, or a phenomenon of continuous creation of matter (see the article on the steady state theory). These ideas are now abandoned, the observed properties of quasars being very well explained by those of an accretion disk in the center of which is a supermassive black hole.

==Big Bang/Supermassive White Hole==
A view of black holes first proposed in the late 1980s might be interpreted as shedding some light on the nature of classical white holes. Some researchers have proposed that when a black hole forms, a Big Bang may occur at the core/singularity, which would create a new universe that expands outside of the &quot;parent universe&quot;.

The Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the affine connection and regarding its antisymmetric part, the torsion tensor, as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of matter. According to general relativity, the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular black hole. In the Einstein–Cartan theory, however, the minimal coupling between torsion and Dirac spinors generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity. Instead, the collapsing matter on the other side of the event horizon reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. The other side of the bridge becomes a new, growing baby universe. For observers in the baby universe, the parent universe appears as the only white hole. Accordingly, the observable universe is the Einstein–Rosen interior of a black hole existing as one of possibly many inside a larger universe. The Big Bang was a nonsingular Big Bounce at which the observable universe had a finite, minimum scale factor.

Shockwave cosmology, proposed by Joel Smoller and Blake Temple in 2003, has the “big bang” as an explosion inside a black hole, producing the expanding volume of space and matter that includes the observable universe. This black hole eventually becomes a white hole as the matter density reduces with the expansion. A related theory gives an alternative to dark energy. 

A 2012 paper argues that the Big Bang itself is a white hole. It further suggests that the emergence of a white hole, which was named a &quot;Small Bang&quot;, is spontaneous—all the matter is ejected at a single pulse. Thus, unlike black holes, white holes cannot be continuously observed; rather, their effects can be detected only around the event itself. The paper even proposed identifying a new group of gamma-ray bursts with white holes.

===Various hypotheses===
Unlike black holes for which there is a well-studied physical process, gravitational collapse (which gives rise to black holes when a star somewhat more massive than the sun exhausts its nuclear &quot;fuel&quot;), there is no clear analogous process that leads reliably to the production of white holes. Although some hypotheses have been put forward:
* White holes as a kind of &quot;exit&quot; from black holes, both types of singularities would probably be connected by a wormhole (note that, like white holes, wormholes have not yet been found); when quasars were discovered it was assumed that these were the sought-after white holes but this assumption has now been discarded.
* Another widespread idea is that white holes would be very unstable, would last a very short time and even after forming could collapse and become black holes.
* Astronomers Alon Retter and Shlomo Heller suggest that the GRB 060614 anomalous gamma-ray burst that occurred in 2006 was a &quot;white hole&quot;.
* In 2014, the idea of the Big Bang being produced by a supermassive white hole explosion was explored in the framework of a five-dimensional vacuum by Madriz Aguilar, Moreno and Bellini.
* Finally, it has been postulated that white holes could be the temporal inverse of a black hole.

At present, very few scientists believe in the existence of white holes and it is considered only a mathematical exercise with no real-world counterpart.

==In popular culture==
* A &quot;white hole&quot; appears in the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode of the same name, wherein the protagonists must find a way to deal with its temporal effects.
* A &quot;white hole&quot; serves as a major source of conflict in the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; anime, as the radiance it exudes is both sentient and evil, known as the Light of Destruction.
* A &quot;white hole&quot; serves as a very important location in the video game &quot;Outer Wilds&quot;. In this game, falling into the black hole in the center of the planet &quot;Brittle Hollow&quot; leads to this &quot;white hole&quot;.
* A &quot;white hole&quot; appears in the animated television series &quot;&quot;.

<text>The National Basketball League (NBL) was a professional basketball league in the United States. Established in 1935 as the Midwest Basketball Conference, it changed its name to the NBL in 1937. After the 1948–49 season, its twelfth, it merged with the Basketball Association of America (BAA) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). Five current NBA teams trace their history back to the NBL: the Atlanta Hawks, the Detroit Pistons, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Sacramento Kings.

== History ==
The league was initially founded as the Midwest Basketball Conference (MBC) in 1935. It changed its name in 1937 in an attempt to attract a larger audience and avoid confusion with the Big Ten Conference, often referred to as the Midwest Conference. The league was created by three corporations: General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear. It was primarily made up of Great Lakes area small-market and corporate teams.

The league began rather informally. Scheduling was left to the discretion of each of the teams, as long as the team played at least ten games and four of them were on the road. Games played increased yearly as the popularity of professional basketball and the NBL grew in America. Games consisted either of four ten-minute quarters or three fifteen-minute periods. The choice was made by the home team. Some of the teams were independent, while others were owned by companies that also found jobs for their players.

Chicago newspaper sports editor Leo Fischer acted as president of the NBL from 1940 to 1944.

In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) incorporated resulting in a three-year battle with the NBL to win both players and fans. The BAA played its games in larger cities and venues. However, NBL tended to have the bigger stars. NBL teams dominated the World Professional Basketball Tournament, an annual invitational tournament held in Chicago and sponsored by the Chicago Herald American. NBL teams won seven out of ten editions of the tournament.

On August 3, 1949, representatives from the 12-year-old NBL and 3 year old BAA met at the BAA offices in New York&#x27;s Empire State Building to finalize a merger. Maurice Podoloff, the president of BAA, became the president of the NBA while Ike Duffey, president of the NBL, became the chairman. The new National Basketball Association (NBA) was made up of 17 teams that represented both small towns and large cities across the country. The NBA claims the BAA&#x27;s history as its own and considers the 1949 deal as an expansion, not a merger. For example, at &quot;NBA History&quot; online, its table of one-line &quot;NBA Season Recaps&quot; begins 1946–47 without comment. It celebrated &quot;NBA at 50&quot; in 1996, with announcement of its 50 Greatest Players among other things.

The NBA does not recognize NBL records and statistics except under certain circumstances. As such, the records and statistics of the BAA and NBL prior to the merger in 1949 are considered in official NBA history only if a player, coach, or team participated in the newly formed NBA after 1949 for one or more seasons.
The history of the NBL falls into three eras, each contributing significantly to the growth of professional basketball and the emergence of the NBA. The first dynasty centered on the Oshkosh All-Stars and their center Leroy &quot;Cowboy&quot; Edwards. The middle years saw the emergence of the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, who were later instrumental in the survival of the NBA during its infancy. The final period of note during the NBL&#x27;s existence centered on George Mikan and the emergence of the big man in basketball.

===Early years===
The Oshkosh All-Stars appeared in the championship series for five consecutive years (1938–42). They won two titles, they were led by a rugged 6&#x27; 4&quot; (1.93 m) center named Leroy &quot;Cowboy&quot; Edwards. Edwards was a consensus NCAA &quot;All American&quot; and Helms Foundation &quot;College Player of the Year&quot; as a member of the 1934–35 University of Kentucky Wildcats. He left Kentucky after two years to pursue a professional basketball career, which was unheard of at the time. He led the NBL in scoring for three consecutive seasons, 1937–1940. He set numerous NBL and professional basketball scoring records and is generally credited with the introduction of the &quot;3 second rule&quot; in basketball which is still in existence today. Edwards played in all 12 NBL seasons with the Oshkosh All-Stars, and retired just prior to its merger with the BAA to form the NBA.

=== Middle years ===
The Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons—so nicknamed because they were owned by Fred Zollner, whose company made pistons for engines—were led by tough veteran Bobby McDermott. The Pistons finished second in 1942 and 1943 and won the league title in 1944 and 1945. Like many teams of that era, it was not uncommon for Fort Wayne to play its games in taverns, armories, high-school gyms or ballrooms.

Under Zollner, the Pistons would eventually play an important role in the survival and growth of the NBA. Zollner&#x27;s financial support of the NBA helped the league stay afloat during its tumultuous formative years.

Challenging the Zollner Pistons and Oshkosh for supremacy were the Sheboygan Red Skins. Beginning in 1941, the season before Fort Wayne joined the NBL, Sheboygan appeared in five of six championship series. They lost to Oshkosh in the 1941 finals, beat Fort Wayne for the title in 1943 but lost to the Zollner Pistons in 1944 and 1945, and were swept in the 1946 finals by the league&#x27;s newest member, the powerhouse Rochester Royals, who boasted Hall of Famers Al Cervi, Bob Davies and Red Holzman.

=== Later years ===
The NBL&#x27;s third era was dominated by George Mikan, the 6&#x27;10&quot; (2.08 m), three-time NCAA &quot;All-American&quot; center from DePaul University in Chicago. As a rookie, he led the Chicago American Gears to the 1947 NBL title, but before the next season, owner Maurice White pulled his team out of the league and formed his own 24-team circuit called the Professional Basketball League of America. That venture quickly failed, and Mikan was signed by the NBL&#x27;s Minneapolis Lakers, where he teamed with the versatile Jim Pollard to win the 1948 championship.

After the 1947–48 season, Mikan&#x27;s Lakers quit the League to join the Basketball Association of America (BAA), along with three other NBL clubs: Rochester, Fort Wayne, and Indianapolis.

The NBL added an all-black team in December of its final season, when one of its replacement clubs folded, the Detroit Vagabond Kings. That franchise was awarded to a famous barnstorming team, the New York Rens, composed entirely of African Americans, to play out the season in Dayton, Ohio, as the Dayton Rens. In 1949, after a three-year battle with the Basketball Association of America (BAA) for fans and players, the NBL merged with the BAA and became the National Basketball Association. A few years after the merger, the NBA adopted the BAA history as its own.

== Legacy ==
The NBL contributed significantly to the foundation of the NBA, but it also had major accomplishments in other areas, most notably in offering opportunities for African-American players. In the 1942–43 season, with many players in the armed forces, two NBL clubs, the Toledo Jim White Chevrolets and the Chicago Studebakers, filled their rosters by signing African-Americans—five years before Jackie Robinson would break baseball&#x27;s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Neither team fared well. Toledo signed several black players to start the season, including Bill Jones, who had starred at the University of Toledo, but the team lost its first four games and folded due to financial difficulties. Chicago stocked its roster with several members of the Harlem Globetrotters, who worked during the week at the Studebaker plant, but it also folded after compiling an 8–15 record.

Five current National Basketball Association (NBA) teams trace their history back to the NBL. Three teams joined the BAA in 1948: the Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers), the Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings), and the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons (now the Detroit Pistons). Two more teams were part of the merger that created the NBA in 1949: the Buffalo Bisons/Tri-Cities Blackhawks (now the Atlanta Hawks), and the Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers).

Five former NBA teams also trace their history back to the NBL: the Anderson Packers, Denver Nuggets, Indianapolis Jets (as the Kautskys), Sheboygan Red Skins and Waterloo Hawks played in the NBL/BAA/NBA. The Jets played in the BAA for the 1948–49 season only; the remaining teams for the 1949–50 season only. Anderson, Sheboygan, and Waterloo joined the National Professional Basketball League in 1950.

The NBL also created the Indianapolis Olympians for the 1949–50 NBL season. When the NBL and BAA merged, this team joined the NBA without playing a single NBL game.

Also still surviving are the Akron Goodyear Wingfoots, the initial NBL champion in 1938. The Wingfoots suspended operations for World War II and were not included in the NBL/BAA merger. Instead, they remained in the National Industrial Basketball League (NIBL), which in 1961 became the National AAU Basketball League (NABL). The Wingfoots are still an AAU Elite team in the NABL.

<text>Auguste Kerckhoffs (19 January 1835 – 9 August 1903) was a Dutch linguist and cryptographer in the late 19th century.

== Biography ==
Kerckhoffs was born in Nuth, the Netherlands, as Jean Guillaume Auguste Victor François Hubert Kerckhoffs, son of Jean Guillaume Kerckhoffs, mayor of the village of Nuth, and Jeanette Elisabeth Lintjens. Kerckhoffs studied at the University of Liège. After a period of teaching in schools in the Netherlands and France, he became a professor of German language at the École des Hautes Études Commerciales (Paris) and the École Arago.

== Principles ==
He is best known today for his two-part paper published in 1883 in &quot;Le Journal des Sciences Militaires&quot; (&quot;Journal of Military Science&quot;) entitled &quot;La Cryptographie Militaire&quot; (&quot;Military Cryptography&quot;). These articles surveyed the then state-of-the-art in military cryptography, and made a plea for considerable improvements in French practice. They also included many pieces of practical advice and rules of thumb, including six principles of practical cipher design:

# The system should be, if not theoretically unbreakable, unbreakable in practice.
# The design of a system should not require secrecy, and compromise of the system should not inconvenience the correspondents (Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle).
# The key should be memorable without notes and should be easily changeable.
# The cryptograms should be transmittable by telegraph.
# The apparatus or documents should be portable and operable by a single person.
# The system should be easy, neither requiring knowledge of a long list of rules nor involving mental strain.

The best-known is the second of his six principles, also known as Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle. It can be understood as the idea that the security of a cryptosystem must depend only on the key, and not on the secrecy of the algorithm used for encryption or any other part of the system.

==Volapük==
In 1885, Dr. Kerckhoffs became interested in the constructed language Volapük, and for several years was a leading member of the Volapük movement, and Director of the Academy of Volapük. He published several books on the subject and introduced the movement to France, Spain, and Scandinavia through a series of public lectures.

<doc id="240986" wikidata="Q901329" url="?curid=240986" title="Oxymercuration reaction">
<text>In organic chemistry, the oxymercuration reaction is an electrophilic addition reaction that transforms an alkene () into a neutral alcohol. In oxymercuration, the alkene reacts with mercuric acetate () in aqueous solution to yield the addition of an acetoxymercury () group and a hydroxy () group across the double bond. Carbocations are not formed in this process and thus rearrangements are not observed. The reaction follows Markovnikov&#x27;s rule (the hydroxy group will always be added to the more substituted carbon). The oxymercuration part of the reaction involves anti addition of OH group but the demercuration part of the reaction involves free radical mechanism and is not stereospecific, i.e. H and OH may be syn or anti to each other.

Oxymercuration followed by reductive demercuration is called an oxymercuration–reduction reaction or oxymercuration–demercuration reaction. This reaction, which is almost always done in practice instead of oxymercuration, is treated at the conclusion of the article.

==Mechanism==
Oxymercuration can be fully described in three steps (the whole process is sometimes called &quot;deoxymercuration&quot;), which is illustrated in stepwise fashion to the right. In the first step, the nucleophilic double bond attacks the mercury ion, ejecting an acetoxy group. The electron pair on the mercury ion in turn attacks a carbon on the double bond, forming a mercurinium ion in which the mercury atom bears a positive charge. The electrons in the highest occupied molecular orbital of the double bond are donated to mercury&#x27;s empty 6s orbital and the electrons in mercury&#x27;s dxz (or dyz) orbital are donated in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the double bond.

In the second step, the nucleophilic water molecule attacks the more substituted carbon, liberating the electrons participating in its bond with mercury. The electrons collapse to the mercury ion and neutralize it. The oxygen in the water molecule now bears a positive charge.

In the third step, a negatively charged acetate ion deprotonates the alkyloxonium ion, forming the waste product HOAc. The two electrons participating in the bond between oxygen and the attacked hydrogen collapse into the oxygen, neutralizing its charge and creating the final alcohol product.

==Regioselectivity and stereochemistry==
Oxymercuration is very regioselective and is a textbook Markovnikov reaction; ruling out extreme cases, the water nucleophile will always preferentially attack the more substituted carbon, depositing the resultant hydroxy group there. This phenomenon is explained by examining the three resonance structures of the mercuronium ion formed at the end of the step one.

By inspection of these structures, it is seen that the positive charge of the mercury atom will sometimes reside on the more substituted carbon (approximately 4% of the time). This forms a temporary tertiary carbocation, which is a very reactive electrophile. The nucleophile will attack the mercuronium ion at this time. Therefore, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it retains a more &quot;positive character&quot; than the lesser substituted carbon.

Stereochemically, oxymercuration is an &quot;anti&quot; addition. As illustrated by the second step, the nucleophile cannot attack the carbon from the same face as the mercury ion because of steric hindrance. There is simply insufficient room on that face of the molecule to accommodate both a mercury ion and the attacking nucleophile. Therefore, when free rotation is impossible, the hydroxy and acetoxymercuri groups will always be trans to each other.

Shown below is an example of regioselectivity and stereospecificity of the oxymercuration reaction with substituted cyclohexenes. A bulky group like &quot;t&quot;-butyl locks the ring in a chair conformation and prevents ring flips. With 4-&quot;t&quot;-butylcyclohexene, oxymercuration yields two products – where addition across the double bond is always &quot;anti&quot; – with slight preference towards acetoxymercury group &quot;trans&quot; to the &quot;t&quot;-butyl group, resulting in slightly more &quot;cis&quot; product. With 1-methyl-4-&quot;t&quot;-butylcyclohexene, oxymercuration yields only one product – still &quot;anti&quot; addition across the double bond – where water only attacks the more substituted carbon. The reason for &quot;anti&quot; addition across the double bond is to maximize orbital overlap of the lone pair of water and the empty orbital of the mercuronium ion on the opposite side of the acetoxymercury group. Regioselectivity is observed to favor water attacking the more substituted carbon, but water does not add &quot;syn&quot; across the double bond which implies that the transition state favors water attacking from the opposite side of the acetomercury group.

==Oxymercuration–reduction==
In practice, the mercury adduct product created by the oxymercuration reaction is almost always treated with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in aqueous base in a reaction called &quot;demercuration&quot;. In demercuration, the acetoxymercury group is replaced with a hydrogen in a stereochemically insensitive reaction known as reductive elimination. The combination of oxymercuration followed immediately by demercuration is called an oxymercuration–reduction reaction.

Therefore, the oxymercuration-reduction reaction is the net addition of water across the double bond. Any stereochemistry set up by the oxymercuration step is scrambled by the demercuration step, so that the hydrogen and hydroxy group may be cis or trans from each other. Oxymercuration reduction is a popular laboratory technique to achieve alkene hydration with Markovnikov selectivity while avoiding carbocation intermediates and thus the rearrangement which can lead to complex product mixtures.

==Other applications==
Oxymercuration is not limited to an alkene reacting with water to add hydroxyl and mercury groups. The carbon–mercury structure can undergo spontaneous replacement of the mercury by hydrogen, rather than persisting until a separate reduction step. In this manner, the effect is for mercury to be a Lewis acid catalyst. For example, using an alkyne instead of an alkene yields an enol, which tautomerizes into a ketone. Using an alcohol instead of water yields an ether (see also Hofmann-Sand reaction). In both cases, Markovnikov&#x27;s rule is observed.

Using a vinyl ether in the presence of an alcohol allows the replacement of one alkoxy group (RO–) for another by way of an acetal intermediate. An allyl alcohol and a vinyl ether under the conditions of oxymercuration–reaction can give R–CH=CH–CH2–O–CH=CH2, which is suitable for a Claisen rearrangement.

<doc id="240988" wikidata="Q278332" url="?curid=240988" title="Tetrahydrofuran">
<text>Tetrahydrofuran (THF), or oxolane, is an organic compound with the formula (CH2)4O. The compound is classified as heterocyclic compound, specifically a cyclic ether. It is a colorless, water-miscible organic liquid with low viscosity. It is mainly used as a precursor to polymers. Being polar and having a wide liquid range, THF is a versatile solvent. It is an isomer of another solvent, butanone.

==Production==
About 200,000 tonnes of tetrahydrofuran are produced annually. The most widely used industrial process involves the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. Ashland/ISP is one of the biggest producers of this chemical route. The method is similar to the production of diethyl ether from ethanol. The butanediol is derived from condensation of acetylene with formaldehyde followed by hydrogenation. DuPont developed a process for producing THF by oxidizing &quot;n&quot;-butane to crude maleic anhydride, followed by catalytic hydrogenation. A third major industrial route entails hydroformylation of allyl alcohol followed by hydrogenation to 1,4-butanediol.

===Other methods===
THF can also be synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of furan. This allows certain sugars to be converted to THF via acid-catalyzed digestion to furfural and decarbonylation to furan, although this method is not widely practiced. THF is thus derivable from renewable resources.

==Applications==
===Polymerization===
In the presence of strong acids, THF converts to a linear polymer called poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMEG), also known as polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO):
:formula_1

This polymer is primarily used to make elastomeric polyurethane fibers like Spandex.

===As a solvent===
The other main application of THF is as an industrial solvent for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in varnishes. It is an aprotic solvent with a dielectric constant of 7.6. It is a moderately polar solvent and can dissolve a wide range of nonpolar and polar chemical compounds. THF is water-miscible and can form solid clathrate hydrate structures with water at low temperatures.

THF has been explored as a miscible co-solvent in aqueous solution to aid in the liquefaction and delignification of plant lignocellulosic biomass for production of renewable platform chemicals and sugars as potential precursors to biofuels. Aqueous THF augments the hydrolysis of glycans from biomass and dissolves the majority of biomass lignin making it a suitable solvent for biomass pretreatment.

THF is often used in polymer science. For example, it can be used to dissolve polymers prior to determining their molecular mass using gel permeation chromatography. THF dissolves PVC as well, and thus it is the main ingredient in PVC adhesives. It can be used to liquefy old PVC cement and is often used industrially to degrease metal parts.

THF is used as a component in mobile phases for reversed-phase liquid chromatography. It has a greater elution strength than methanol or acetonitrile, but is less commonly used than these solvents.

THF is used as a solvent in 3D printing when printing with PLA, PETG and substantially similar filaments. It can be used to clean clogged 3D printer parts, to remove extruder lines and add a shine to the finished product as well as to solvent weld printed parts.

====Laboratory use====
In the laboratory, THF is a popular solvent when its water miscibility is not an issue. It is more basic than diethyl ether and forms stronger complexes with Li+, Mg2+, and boranes. It is a popular solvent for hydroboration reactions and for organometallic compounds such as organolithium and Grignard reagents. Thus, while diethyl ether remains the solvent of choice for some reactions (e.g., Grignard reactions), THF fills that role in many others, where strong coordination is desirable and the precise properties of ethereal solvents such as these (alone and in mixtures and at various temperatures) allows fine-tuning modern chemical reactions.

Commercial THF contains substantial water that must be removed for sensitive operations, e.g. those involving organometallic compounds. Although THF is traditionally dried by distillation from an aggressive desiccant such as elemental sodium, molecular sieves have been shown to be superior water scavengers.

====Reaction with hydrogen sulfide====
In the presence of a solid acid catalyst, THF reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give tetrahydrothiophene.

==Lewis basicity==
THF is a Lewis base that bonds to a variety of Lewis acids such as I2, phenols, triethylaluminum and bis(hexafluoroacetylacetonato)copper(II). THF has been classified in the ECW model and it has been shown that there is no one order of base strengths. Many complexes are of the stoichiometry MCl3(THF)3.

==Precautions==
THF is a relatively acutely nontoxic solvent, with the median lethal dose (LD50) comparable to that for acetone. However, chronic exposure is suspected of causing cancer. Reflecting its remarkable solvent properties, it penetrates the skin, causing rapid dehydration. THF readily dissolves latex and thus should be handled with nitrile rubber gloves. It is highly flammable.

One danger posed by THF is its tendency to form the explosive compound 2-hydroperoxytetrahydrofuran upon reaction with air:
To minimize this problem, commercial supplies of THF are often stabilized with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Distillation of THF to dryness is unsafe because the explosive peroxides can concentrate in the residue.

==Related compounds==
===Tetrahydrofurans===

The tetrahydrofuran ring is found in diverse natural products including lignans, acetogenins, and polyketide natural products. Diverse methodology has been developed for the synthesis of substituted THFs.

===Oxolanes===
Tetrahydrofuran is one of the class of pentic cyclic ethers called &quot;oxolanes&quot;. There are seven possible structures, namely,
* Monoxolane, the root of the group, synonymous with &quot;tetrahydrofuran&quot;
* 1,3-dioxolane
* 1,2-dioxolane 
* 1,2,4-trioxolane
* 1,2,3-trioxolane
* tetroxolane
* pentoxolane

<doc id="240989" wikidata="Q58590" url="?curid=240989" title="Yao Ming">
<text>Yao Ming (; born September 12, 1980) is a Chinese basketball executive and former professional player. He played for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Yao was selected to start for the Western Conference in the NBA All-Star Game eight times, and was named to the All-NBA Team five times. During his final season, he was the tallest active player in the NBA, at .

Yao, who was born in Shanghai, started playing for the Sharks as a teenager, and played on their senior team for five years in the CBA, winning a championship in his final year. After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, Yao was selected by the Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA playoffs four times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons. In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.

Yao is one of China&#x27;s best-known athletes internationally, with sponsorships with several major companies. His rookie year in the NBA was the subject of a documentary film, &quot;The Year of the Yao&quot;, and he co-wrote, along with NBA analyst Ric Bucher, an autobiography titled &quot;Yao: A Life in Two Worlds&quot;. Known in China as the &quot;Yao Ming Phenomenon&quot; and in the United States as the &quot;Ming Dynasty&quot;, Yao&#x27;s success in the NBA, and his popularity among fans, made him a symbol of a new China that was both more modern and more confident. Yao is also an entrepreneur and owner of Yao Family Wines in Napa Valley, California.

In April 2016, Yao was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, alongside Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Allen Iverson, becoming the first Chinese national to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. In February 2017, Yao was unanimously elected as chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association. Yao had a storied career as a member of the Chinese national team. With the national team, Yao won the FIBA Asia Cup in 2001, 2003, and 2005, winning MVP of the tournament all three times. He also made the All-Tournament Team at the FIBA World Cup in 2002. Yao retired from the Chinese national team after the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

== Early life ==
Yao Ming was born on September 12, 1980, in Shanghai, China. He is the only child of Yao Zhiyuan and Fang Fengdi, both of whom were former professional basketball players. At , Yao weighed more than twice as much as the average Chinese newborn. When Yao was nine years old, he began playing basketball and attended a junior sports school. The following year, Yao measured and was examined by sports doctors, who predicted he would grow to .

== Professional career ==

=== Shanghai Sharks (1997–2002) ===
Yao first tried out for the Shanghai Sharks&#x27; junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was 13 years old, and practiced ten hours a day for his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the Sharks&#x27; senior team, where he averaged 10 points and 8 rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot for the second time in his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15 cm). The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao&#x27;s third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9 points and 20.2 rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of his shots during one game in the finals.

=== Houston Rockets (2002–2011) ===
Yao was pressured to enter the NBA draft in 1999 by Li Yaomin, the deputy general manager of the Shanghai Sharks. Li also influenced Yao to sign a contract for Evergreen Sports Inc. to serve as his agent. The agreement entitled Evergreen to 33% of Yao&#x27;s earnings, but the contract was later determined to be invalid.

As American attention on Yao grew, Chinese authorities also took interest. In 2002, the Chinese government released new regulations that would require him and other Chinese players to turn over half of any NBA earnings to the government and China&#x27;s national basketball association, including endorsements as well as salaries.

When Yao decided to enter the 2002 NBA draft, a group of advisers was formed that came to be known as &quot;Team Yao&quot;. The team consisted of Yao&#x27;s negotiator, Erik Zhang; his NBA agent, Bill Duffy; his Chinese agent, Lu Hao; University of Chicago economics professor John Huizinga; and the vice president for marketing at BDA Sports Management, Bill Sanders. Yao was widely predicted to be picked number one overall. However, some teams were concerned about Yao&#x27;s NBA eligibility because of uncertainty over whether the CBA would let Yao play in the United States.

Shortly after Wang Zhizhi refused to return to China to play for the national team and was subsequently banned from playing for China, the CBA stipulated that Yao would have to return to play for the national team. They also said they would not let him go to the United States unless the Houston Rockets would take him first overall. After assurances from Team Yao that the Rockets would draft Yao with their number one pick, the CBA gave permission on the morning of the draft for Yao to play in the U.S. When the Rockets selected Yao with the first pick of the draft, he became the first international player ever to be selected first overall without having previously played U.S. college basketball.

==== Beginning years (2002–2005) ====
Yao did not participate in the Rockets&#x27; pre-season training camp, instead playing for China in the 2002 FIBA World Championships. Before the season, several commentators, including Bill Simmons and Dick Vitale, predicted that Yao would fail in the NBA, and Charles Barkley said he would &quot;kiss Kenny Smith&#x27;s ass&quot; if Yao scored more than 19 points in one of his rookie-season games. Yao played his first NBA game against the Indiana Pacers, scoring no points and grabbing two rebounds, and scored his first NBA basket against the Denver Nuggets. In his first seven games, he averaged only 14 minutes and 4 points, but on November 17, he scored 20 points on a perfect 9-of-9 from the field and 2-of-2 from the free-throw line against the Lakers. Barkley made good on his bet by kissing the buttock of a donkey purchased by Smith for the occasion (Smith&#x27;s &quot;ass&quot;).

In Yao&#x27;s first game in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an East Asian cultural stereotype. Yao was not angry with the promotion because he was not familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.

Before Yao&#x27;s first meeting with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal on January 17, 2003, O&#x27;Neal said, &quot;Tell Yao Ming, ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh&quot;, prompting accusations of racism. O&#x27;Neal denied that his comments were racist, and said he was only joking. Yao also said he believed O&#x27;Neal was joking, but he said a lot of Asians would not see the humor. In the game, Yao scored the Rockets&#x27; first six points of the game and blocked O&#x27;Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O&#x27;Neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10 seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks; O&#x27;Neal recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 0 blocks. O&#x27;Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.

The NBA began offering All-Star ballots in three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. Yao was voted to start for the West over O&#x27;Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards. Yao received nearly a quarter million more votes than O&#x27;Neal, and he became the first rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.
Yao finished his rookie season averaging 13.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, and was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting to Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, and a unanimous pick for the NBA All-Rookie First Team selection. He was also voted the &quot;Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year, and won the Laureus Newcomer of the Year award.
Before the start of Yao&#x27;s sophomore season, Rockets&#x27; head coach Rudy Tomjanovich resigned because of health issues, and long-time New York Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy was brought in. After Van Gundy began focusing the offense on Yao, Yao averaged career highs in points and rebounds for the season, and had a career-high 41 points and 7 assists in a triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks in February 2004. He was also voted to be the starting center for the Western Conference in the 2004 NBA All-Star Game for the second straight year. Yao finished the season averaging 17.5 points and 9.0 rebounds a game. The Rockets made the playoffs for the first time in Yao&#x27;s career, claiming the seventh seed in the Western Conference. In the first round, however, the Los Angeles Lakers eliminated Houston in five games. Yao averaged 15.0 points and 7.4 rebounds in his first playoff series.

In the summer of 2004, the Rockets acquired Tracy McGrady from the Orlando Magic in a seven-player trade that also sent Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley to Orlando. Although Yao said that Francis and Mobley had &quot;helped [him] in every way [his] first two seasons&quot;, he added, &quot;I&#x27;m excited about playing with Tracy McGrady. He can do some amazing things.&quot; After the trade, it was predicted that the Rockets would be title contenders. Both McGrady and Yao were voted to start in the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, and Yao broke the record previously held by Michael Jordan for most All-Star votes, with 2,558,278 total votes. The Rockets won 51 games and finished fifth in the West, and made the playoffs for the second consecutive year, where they faced the Dallas Mavericks. The Rockets won the first two games in Dallas, and Yao made 13 of 14 shots in the second game, the best shooting performance in the playoffs in Rockets history. However, the Rockets lost four of their last five games and lost Game 7 by 40 points, the largest Game 7 deficit in NBA history. Yao&#x27;s final averages for the series were 21.4 points on 65% shooting and 7.7 rebounds.

==== Career highs and injury-plagued seasons (2005–2011) ====

After missing only two games out of 246 in his first three years of NBA play, Yao endured an extended period on the inactive list in his fourth season after developing osteomyelitis in the big toe on his left foot, and surgery was performed on the toe on December 18, 2005. Despite missing 21 games while recovering, Yao again had the most fan votes to start the 2006 NBA All-Star Game.

In 25 games after the All-Star break, Yao averaged 25.7 points and 11.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 53.7% from the field and 87.8% at the free-throw line. His final averages in 57 games were 22.3 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. It was the first time that he ended the season with a so-called &quot;20/10&quot; average. However, Tracy McGrady played only 47 games in the season, missing time because of back spasms. Yao and McGrady played only 31 games together, and the Rockets did not make the playoffs, winning only 34 games. With only four games left in the season, Yao suffered another injury in a game against the Utah Jazz on April 10, 2006, which left him with a broken bone in his left foot. The injury required six months of rest.

Early into his fifth season, Yao was injured again, this time breaking his right knee on December 23, 2006, while attempting to block a shot. Up to that point he had been averaging 26.8 points, 9.7 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game, and had been mentioned as an MVP candidate. Yao was unable to play in what would have been his fifth All-Star game; he was medically cleared to play on March 4, 2007, after missing 32 games.

Despite Yao&#x27;s absence, the Rockets made the playoffs with the home court advantage against the Utah Jazz in the first round. The Rockets won the first two games, but then lost four of five games and were eliminated in Game 7 at home; Yao scored 29 points—15 in the fourth quarter. Although he averaged 25.1 points and 10.3 rebounds for the series, Yao said afterwards &quot;I didn&#x27;t do my job&quot;. At the end of the season, Yao was selected to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career, after being selected to the All-NBA Third Team twice.

On May 18, 2007, only weeks after the Rockets were eliminated from the playoffs, Jeff Van Gundy was dismissed as head coach. Three days later, the Rockets signed former Sacramento Kings coach Rick Adelman, who was thought to focus more on offense than the defensive-minded Van Gundy.

On November 9, 2007, Yao played against fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian for the first time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was broadcast on 19 networks in China, and was watched by over 200 million people in China alone, making it one of the most-watched NBA games in history. In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12 games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA playoffs, but he did not miss the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August. After Yao&#x27;s injury, the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history. Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months. Yao&#x27;s final averages in 55 games were 22.0 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 2.0 blocks a game.

The next season, Yao played 77 games, his first full season since the 2004–05 season, and averaged 19.7 points and 9.9 rebounds, while shooting 54.8% from the field, and a career-high 86.6% from the free throw line. Despite McGrady suffering a season-ending injury in February, the Rockets finished with 53 wins and the fifth seed in the Western Conference. Facing the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, Yao finished with 24 points on 9-of-9 shooting in the first game, and the Rockets won 108–81, in Portland. The Rockets won all their games in Houston, and advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 1997, and the first time in Yao&#x27;s career.

The Rockets faced the Lakers in the second round, and Yao scored 28 points, with 8 points in the final four minutes, to lead the Rockets to a 100–92 win in Los Angeles. However, the Rockets lost their next two games, and Yao was diagnosed with a sprained ankle after Game 3. A follow-up test revealed a hairline fracture in his left foot, and he was ruled out for the remainder of the playoffs. In reaction, Yao said the injury, which did not require surgery, was &quot;better than last year&quot;. However, follow-up analysis indicated that the injury could be career threatening. The Yao-less Rockets went on to win Game 4 against the Lakers to even the series 2–2. The Rockets eventually lost the series in seven games.

In July 2009, Yao discussed the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets applied for a disabled player exception, an exception to the NBA salary cap which grants the injured player&#x27;s team money to sign a free agent. The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7 million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in his left foot. He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.

For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets said they would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to play him on back-to-back nights. Their goal was to keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, it was announced that Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao&#x27;s contract with the Rockets expired at the end of the season, and he became a free agent.

=== Retirement ===
On July 20, 2011, Yao announced his retirement from basketball in a press conference in Shanghai. He cited injuries to his foot and ankle, including the third fracture to his left foot sustained near the end of 2010. His retirement sparked over 1.2 million comments on the Chinese social-networking site Sina Weibo. Reacting to Yao&#x27;s retirement, NBA commissioner David Stern said Yao was a &quot;bridge between Chinese and American fans&quot; and that he had &quot;a wonderful mixture of talent, dedication, humanitarian aspirations and a sense of humor.&quot; Shaquille O&#x27;Neal said Yao &quot;was very agile. He could play inside, he could play outside, and if he didn&#x27;t have those injuries he could&#x27;ve been up there in the top five centers to ever play the game.&quot;

Yao was nominated by a member of the Chinese media for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor to the game. He would have been eligible for induction as early as 2012, but Yao felt it was too soon and requested that the Hall of Fame delay consideration of the nomination. The Hall granted Yao&#x27;s request, and said it was Yao&#x27;s decision when the process would be restarted.

On September 9, 2016, Yao was inducted into the Hall of Fame along with 4-time NBA champion Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Allen Iverson. Continuing with the honors, on February 3, 2017, Yao&#x27;s Number 11 jersey was retired by the Houston Rockets.

== National team career ==
=== 2000 and 2004 Olympics ===
Yao first played for China in the 2000 Summer Olympics, and he was dubbed, together with teammates Wang Zhizhi and Mengke Bateer, &quot;the Walking Great Wall&quot;. During the 2004 Athens Olympics, Yao carried the Chinese flag during the opening ceremony, which he said was a &quot;long dream come true&quot;. He then vowed to abstain from shaving his beard for half a year unless the Chinese national team made it into the quarter-finals of the 2004 Olympics. After Yao scored 39 points in a win against New Zealand, China lost 58–83, 57–82, and 52–89 against Spain, Argentina and Italy respectively. In the final group game, however, a 67–66 win over the reigning 2002 FIBA World Champions Serbia and Montenegro moved them into the quarterfinals. Yao scored 27 points and had 13 rebounds, and he hit two free throws with 28 seconds left that proved to be the winning margin. He averaged 20.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game while shooting 55.9% from the field.

=== Asian Cup ===
Yao led the Chinese national team to three consecutive FIBA Asia Cup gold medals, winning the 2001 FIBA Asian Championship, the 2003 FIBA Asian Championship, and the 2005 FIBA Asian Championship. He was also named the MVP of all three tournaments.

=== 2006 World Championship ===
Yao&#x27;s injury at the end of the 2005–06 NBA season required a full six months of rest, threatening his participation in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. However, he recovered before the start of the tournament, and in the last game of the preliminary round, he had 36 points and 10 rebounds in a win against Slovenia to lead China into the Round of 16. In the first knockout round, however, China was defeated by eventual finalist Greece. Yao&#x27;s final averages were 25.3 points, the most in the tournament, and 9.0 rebounds a game, which was fourth overall.

=== 2008 Olympics ===

After having surgery to repair his fractured foot, Yao stated if he could not play in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, &quot;It would be the biggest loss in my career to right now.&quot; He returned to play with the Chinese national team on July 17, 2008. On August 6, Yao carried the Olympic flame into Tiananmen Square, as part of the Olympic torch relay. He also carried the Chinese flag and led his country&#x27;s delegation during the opening ceremony. Yao scored the first basket of the game, a three-pointer, in China&#x27;s opening 2008 Olympics Basketball Tournament game against the eventual gold medal-winning United States.

&quot;I was just really happy to make that shot&quot;, Yao said after the Americans&#x27; 101–70 victory. &quot;It was the first score in our Olympic campaign here at home and I&#x27;ll always remember it. It represents that we can keep our heads up in the face of really tough odds.&quot;

Following an overtime defeat to Spain, Yao scored 30 points in a win over Angola, and 25 points in a three-point win against Germany, which clinched China&#x27;s place in the quarterfinals. However, China lost to Lithuania in the quarterfinals by 26 points, eliminating them from the tournament. Yao&#x27;s 19 points a game were the second-highest in the Olympics, and his averages of 8.2 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game were third overall.

===Chinese Basketball Association===
Yao served as chair of the Chinese Basketball Association from 2017 until his resignation in 2024 due to personal issues.

== Personal life ==
After Yao announced that he would enter the 2002 NBA draft, he told one American journalist that he had been studying English for two years, and that he liked the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot; but disliked hip hop. He was sometimes accompanied during interviews in Shanghai by one of his parents, whose basketball careers were derailed by the 1966–76 Cultural Revolution, and who came to his Shanghai Sharks games on bicycles.

Yao met Chinese female basketball player Ye Li when he was 17 years old. Ye was not fond of Yao at first, but finally accepted him after he gave her the team pins he had collected during the 2000 Summer Olympics. She is the only woman he has ever dated. Their relationship became public when they appeared together during the 2004 Olympics closing ceremony. On August 6, 2007, Yao and Ye married in a ceremony attended by close friends and family and closed to the media. On May 21, 2010, the couple&#x27;s daughter Yao Qinlei (whose English name is Amy) was born in Houston, Texas.

In 2004, Yao co-wrote an autobiography with ESPN sportswriter Ric Bucher, entitled &quot;Yao: A Life in Two Worlds&quot;. In the same year, he was also the subject of a documentary film, &quot;The Year of the Yao&quot;, which focuses on his NBA rookie year. The film is narrated by his friend and interpreter, Colin Pine. In 2005, former &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer Brook Larmer published a book entitled &quot;Operation Yao Ming&quot;, in which he said that Yao&#x27;s parents were convinced to marry each other so that they would produce a dominant athlete, and that during Yao&#x27;s childhood, he was given special treatment to help him become a great basketball player. In a 2015 AMA post on Reddit, Yao stated that this was not true and that he started playing basketball for fun at age 9. In 2009, Yao provided the voice for a character of a Chinese animated film, &quot;The Magic Aster&quot;, released on June 19.

Yao enrolled at the Antai College of Economics &amp; Management of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2011. He took a tailored degree program with mostly one-on-one lectures to avoid being a distraction on campus. Yao completed his studies in July 2018, graduating with a degree in economics after 7 years of study.

In 2016, Yao opened a winery called Yao Family Wines in Napa Valley, California, which serves Cabernet Sauvignon blends and &quot;the kind of rich-but-balanced luxury reds he&#x27;d come to enjoy in Houston steakhouses.&quot; American wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. of &quot;The Wine Advocate&quot; gave Yao&#x27;s wine a ranking of 96 points and wrote: &quot;I am aware of all the arguments that major celebrities lending their names to wines is generally a formula for mediocrity, but... the two Cabernets are actually brilliant, and the reserve bottling ranks alongside just about anything made in Napa.&quot;

==Other activities==

===Commercial engagements===

Yao is one of China&#x27;s most recognizable athletes, along with Liu Xiang. As of 2009, he had led Forbes&#x27; Chinese celebrities list in income and popularity for six straight years, earning US$51 million (CN¥357 million) in 2008. A major part of his income comes from his sponsorship deals, as he is under contract with several major companies to endorse their products. He was signed by Nike until the end of his rookie season. When Nike decided not to renew his contract, he signed with Reebok. He also had a deal with Pepsi, and he successfully sued Coca-Cola in 2003 when they used his image on their bottles while promoting the national team. He eventually signed with Coca-Cola for the 2008 Olympics. His other deals include partnerships with Visa, Apple, Garmin, and McDonald&#x27;s.

On July 16, 2009, Yao bought his former club team, the Shanghai Sharks, which were on the verge of not being able to play the next season of the Chinese Basketball Association because of financial troubles.

===Philanthropy===
Yao has also participated in many charity events during his career, including the NBA&#x27;s Basketball Without Borders program. In the NBA&#x27;s offseason in 2003, Yao hosted a telethon, which raised US$300,000 to help stop the spread of SARS. In September 2007, he held an auction that raised US$965,000 (CN¥6.75 million), and competed in a charity basketball match to raise money for underprivileged children in China. He was joined by fellow NBA stars Steve Nash, Carmelo Anthony, and Baron Davis, and Hong Kong actor Jackie Chan. After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Yao donated $2 million to relief work and created the Yao Ming Foundation to help rebuild schools destroyed in the earthquake.

===Conservation work===

Yao partnered with WildAid to appear in commercials and documentaries to educate citizens on the harmful effects of shark fin soup on shark species. From 2011 to 2018, consumption of shark fin soup dropped by 70% in China. In August 2012, Yao started filming a documentary about the northern white rhinoceros. He is also an ambassador for elephant conservation. In 2014, he was also part of the documentary &quot;The End of the Wild&quot; about elephant conservation. Yao has filmed a number of public service announcements for elephant and rhino conservation for the &quot;Say No&quot; campaign with partners African Wildlife Foundation and WildAid.

===Politics===
On March 3, 2013, Yao attended the First Session of the 12th Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference as one of its 2,200 members. He was a member of the CPPCC from 2013 to 2018. While he is involved in Chinese politics, he is not a member of the Chinese Communist Party, although he has been awarded the Proletarian Award by the party for his spreading of literacy and socialist ideologies.

<doc id="240990" wikidata="Q17146784" url="?curid=240990" title="Hydroboration–oxidation reaction">
<text>Hydroboration–oxidation reaction is a two-step hydration reaction that converts an alkene into an alcohol. The process results in the syn addition of a hydrogen and a hydroxyl group where the double bond had been. Hydroboration–oxidation is an anti-Markovnikov reaction, with the hydroxyl group attaching to the less-substituted carbon. The reaction thus provides a more stereospecific and complementary regiochemical alternative to other hydration reactions such as acid-catalyzed addition and the oxymercuration–reduction process. The reaction was first reported by Herbert C. Brown in the late 1950s and it was recognized in his receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.

The general form of the reaction is as follows:
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is the archetypal solvent used for hydroboration.

==Mechanism and scope==
===Hydroboration step===
In the first step, borane (BH3) adds to the double bond, transferring one of the hydrogen atoms to the carbon adjacent to the one that becomes bonded to the boron. This hydroboration is repeated two additional times, successively reacting each B–H bond so that three alkenes add to each BH3. The resulting trialkylborane is treated with hydrogen peroxide in the second step. This process replaces the B-C bonds with HO-C bonds. The boron reagent is converted to boric acid. The reaction was originally described by H.C. Brown in 1957 for the conversion of 1-hexene into 1-hexanol.

Knowing that the group containing the boron will be replaced by a hydroxyl group, it can be seen that the initial hydroboration step determines the regioselectivity. Hydroboration proceeds in an anti-Markovnikov manner. The reaction sequence is also stereospecific, giving syn addition (on the same face of the alkene): the hydroboration is syn-selective and the oxidation replaces the boron with hydroxyl having the same geometric position. Thus 1-methylcyclopentene reacts with diborane predominantly to give &quot;trans&quot;-1-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentane—the newly added H and OH are &quot;cis&quot; to each other.

Until all hydrogens attached to boron have been transferred away, the boron group BH2 will continue adding to more alkenes. This means that one mole of hydroborane will undergo the reaction with three moles of alkene. Furthermore, it is not necessary for the hydroborane to have more than one hydrogen. For example, reagents of the type R2BH are commonly used, where R can represents the remainder of the molecule. Such modified hydroboration reagents include 9-BBN, catecholborane, and disiamylborane.

===Oxidation step===
In the second step of the reaction sequence, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide anion attacks the boron atom. Alkyl migration to oxygen gives the alkyl borane with retention of stereochemistry (in reality, the reaction occurs via the trialkyl borate B(OR)3, rather than the monoalkyl borinic ester BH2OR).
The &#x27;H&#x27; atom in the reaction comes from B2H6, the &#x27;O&#x27; atom comes from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) whereas the O attached &#x27;H&#x27; atom comes from the solvent (refer mechanism).

==Alkyne hydroboration==
A hydroboration reaction also takes place on alkynes. Again the mode of action is &quot;syn&quot; and secondary reaction products are aldehydes from terminal alkynes and ketones from internal alkynes. In order to prevent hydroboration across both the pi-bonds, a bulky borane like disiamyl (di-sec-iso-amyl) borane is used.
==Alternative oxidations==
Use of other oxidants instead of hydrogen peroxide can lead to carbonyl products rather than alcohols from alkenes. &quot;N&quot;-Methylmorpholine &quot;N&quot;-oxide with catalytic tetrapropylammonium perruthenate converts the alkylborane into a carbonyl, thus a ketone or aldehyde product depending on what other groups were attached to that carbon in the original alkene. Various dichromates or related chromium(VI) reagents give ketones as well, but give carboxylic acids instead of aldehydes for terminal alkenes.

==Other oxidation substrates==
Aside from boranes, the oxidation of silanes and disilanes can also yield hydroxy groups. A major difference is that while silyl groups like the phenyldimethylsilyl group are converted to the hydroxy group after acid or other electrophile treatment followed by oxidation by hydrogen peroxide, disilanyl groups are converted after TBAF treatment followed by peroxide oxidation. This allows for selective oxidation of either group.

<text>In cryptography, an S-box (substitution-box) is a basic component of symmetric key algorithms which performs substitution. In block ciphers, they are typically used to obscure the relationship between the key and the ciphertext, thus ensuring Shannon&#x27;s property of confusion. Mathematically, an S-box is a nonlinear vectorial Boolean function.

In general, an S-box takes some number of input bits, &quot;m&quot;, and transforms them into some number of output bits, &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is not necessarily equal to &quot;m&quot;. An &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; S-box can be implemented as a lookup table with 2&quot;m&quot; words of &quot;n&quot; bits each. Fixed tables are normally used, as in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), but in some ciphers the tables are generated dynamically from the key (e.g. the Blowfish and the Twofish encryption algorithms).

== Example ==
One good example of a fixed table is the S-box from DES (S5), mapping 6-bit input into a 4-bit output:

Given a 6-bit input, the 4-bit output is found by selecting the row using the outer two bits (the first and last bits), and the column using the inner four bits. For example, an input &quot;011011&quot; has outer bits &quot;01&quot; and inner bits &quot;1101&quot;; the corresponding output would be &quot;1001&quot;.

== Analysis and properties ==
When DES was first published in 1977, the design criteria of its S-boxes were kept secret to avoid compromising the technique of differential cryptanalysis (which was not yet publicly known). As a result, research in what made good S-boxes was sparse at the time. Rather, the eight S-boxes of DES were the subject of intense study for many years out of a concern that a &quot;backdoor&quot; (a vulnerability known only to its designers) might have been planted in the cipher. As the S-boxes are the only nonlinear part of the cipher, compromising those would compromise the entire cipher.

The S-box design criteria were eventually published (in ) after the public rediscovery of differential cryptanalysis, showing that they had been carefully tuned to increase resistance against this specific attack such that it was no better than brute force. Biham and Shamir found that even small modifications to an S-box could significantly weaken DES.

Any S-box where any linear combination of output bits is produced by a bent function of the input bits is termed a perfect S-box.

S-boxes can be analyzed using linear cryptanalysis and differential cryptanalysis in the form of a Linear approximation table (LAT) or Walsh transform and &quot;Difference Distribution Table&quot; (DDT) or autocorrelation table and spectrum. Its strength may be summarized by the &quot;nonlinearity&quot; (bent, almost bent) and &quot;differential uniformity&quot; (perfectly nonlinear, almost perfectly nonlinear).

<text>Korn Ferry is a management consulting firm headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1969 and as of 2019, operates in 111 offices in 53 countries and employs 8,198 people worldwide. Korn Ferry operates through four business segments: Consulting, Digital, Executive Search, Recruitment Process Outsourcing and Professional Search.

==History==
Korn Ferry was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.

In 1969 the firm went public with an initial public offering (IPO), but in 1974 reacquired all outstanding shares to become private again. In 1973 Korn Ferry formed Tokyo, Japan-based Korn Ferry International Japan. With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore, the company had 41 offices in 20 countries. In 1977 they acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard &amp; Associados. In 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.

In 1981 the company became the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO. In 1987 the firm opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand. They then had 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations. In 1989, the firm&#x27;s revenues exceeded $100 million for the first time.

In May 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman and Richard Ferry, the president and CEO, assumed the additional role of chairman. Following this, the firm initiated several office closures. In 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system for screening job candidates. In 1993, the firm acquired Carre Orban and Partners and merged its European operations into a firm branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International. In the next five years, the firm opened their first offices in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).

In August 1998, Korn Ferry partnered with The Wall Street Journal to start Futurestep.com, aimed at the middle management level. By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries; it incurred worldwide losses of $60 million through January 31, 2001.

In 1999 Korn Ferry acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and the Australian firm Amrop International. In 2000 it acquired the London-based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M. In 2000 it purchased Boston-based financial services search firm Westgate Group, and Canada-based Pratzer &amp; Partners Inc.

During an executive-search industry contraction, Korn Ferry&#x27;s 2001 redundancies were &quot;more dramatic than those of competitors who aren&#x27;t publicly traded&quot; such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. This was reported and attributed to having &quot;expanded so heavily during the technology boom&quot; coupled with Korn Ferry&#x27;s new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to &quot;send a message to shareholders.&quot;

In 2001 Korn Ferry purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner &amp; Associates, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth. In 2005 the firm moved its regional head office to Shanghai, China, and had a total of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger Limited of Golden Valley for $24M.

In 2006 the company acquired Lominger International, and in 2007 Gary Burnison became the company&#x27;s new CEO. That year the company acquired LeaderSource. In 2008 they acquired Lore International Institute, and in June 2009, they acquired the London-based Whitehead Mann. In 2010 they acquired Sensa Solutions, in 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House for $80M; in 2015 they acquired Pivot Leadership and Hay Group.

In 2018 Korn Ferry took a one-time, non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $106 million, or $79 million on an after-tax basis, to account for rebranding its entire business simply as &quot;Korn Ferry,&quot; and sunsetting all the Company&#x27;s sub-brands, including Futurestep, Hay Group, and Lominger.

According to a list maintained by the Yale School of Management, in March 2022, the company continued to do business in Russia despite a widespread boycott after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In April 2022, the company suspended its operations in Russia. 

Korn Ferry has implemented significant workforce reductions during challenging economic periods:

* 2001: Amid an industry downturn, Korn Ferry reduced its workforce by 20%. This action was notably more substantial than those of its privately held competitors, such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The firm had expanded significantly during the technology boom, and the new CEO, Paul C. Reilly, aimed to convey a message to shareholders through these cuts.
* 2023-2024: In response to a challenging macroeconomic environment characterized by inflation, rising interest rates, and global uncertainties, Korn Ferry announced plans to eliminate approximately 8% of its workforce over a 6-8 month period in 2023-2024. This reduction was expected to decrease the company&#x27;s annualized cost base by $110 million to $120 million.

These instances highlight Korn Ferry&#x27;s strategic, yet controversial responses to economic pressures, involving workforce reductions to manage costs to satisfy shareholders in short term.

===Whitehead Mann===
Whitehead Mann was a London-based executive search firm that was acquired by Korn/Ferry International in June 2009.

Whitehead Engineering was founded by Clive Whitehead, who on marriage merged his firm with that of his wife&#x27;s, the psychologist Anna Mann (Mann Recruitment), to form Whitehead Mann in the 1970s. The firm listed on the AIM part of FTSE in 1997. By 2003 the company had market capitalisation of £33 million mainly through acquisition, with offices in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and New York; together with training and advisory divisions.

During the dot.com boom, the firm&#x27;s fortunes climbed and fell. After strategy disagreements with new CEO Gerard Clery-Melin, in 2003 Mann announced her decision to leave the firm, subsequently setting up MWM Consulting in 2004. In 2006, the company was subject of a £26 million management buyout, financed by investor Palladian Investors, a division of Och-Ziff. Carol Leonard subsequently took a six-month sabbatical as head of search, and then left the firm in February 2009.

===Litigation===
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, of stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm. In 2008 Nosal was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). In 2016 the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in &quot;United States v Nosal,&quot; that Nosal&#x27;s was a criminal act under CFAA.&quot; In 2018 Nosal was ordered to prison.

==Sponsorship==
On June 19, 2019, the PGA Tour and Korn Ferry announced they had entered a 10-year agreement making Korn Ferry the Umbrella Sponsor of the newly named Korn Ferry Tour, the developmental tour for the PGA. In replacing Web.com, Korn Ferry&#x27;s sponsorship will extend through the 2028 season. The Korn Ferry Tour will continue to award PGA Tour membership to the Tour&#x27;s 50 leading players, including the top 25 from the Regular Season points list and the top 25 from the three-event Korn Ferry Tour Finals points list.

<doc id="240994" wikidata="Q463519" url="?curid=240994" title="American Basketball League (1961–1962)">
<text>The American Basketball League played one full season, 1961–1962, and approximately one-third of the next season until the league folded on December 31, 1962. The ABL was the first basketball league to have a three-point field goal for shots attempted from longer distance. Other rules that set the league apart from the National Basketball Association (NBA) were a 30-second shooting clock, as opposed to 24, and a wider free throw lane of 18 feet instead of the NBA&#x27;s then-standard 12; the NBA would later expand their free throw lane to 16 feet (a couple of feet shorter than the ABL&#x27;s free throw lane) a few years later in 1964, partially as a means of preventing the dominance of center play there, which is still in use as that to this day.

==Formation==
The league was formed when Harlem Globetrotters owner Abe Saperstein was not awarded the Los Angeles National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise he felt he had been promised in return for his years of supporting the NBA with doubleheader games featuring his highly popular Trotters.

When Minneapolis Lakers owner Bob Short was permitted to move the Lakers to Los Angeles, Saperstein reacted by convincing National Alliance of Basketball Leagues (NABL) team owner Paul Cohen (Tuck Tapers) and Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) National Champion Cleveland Pipers owner George Steinbrenner to take the top NABL and AAU teams and players and form a rival league.

Saperstein had been secretly planning the new league since 1959 but it is unclear whether he would have abandoned these plans had he been granted the NBA franchise. In reality, Saperstein and Cohen each secretly made arrangements with local promoters in the other cities to finance those teams so there would be an eight-team league. The eight teams would be separated into two divisions: the East Division (originally hosting the Chicago Majors, Cleveland Pipers, Pittsburgh Rens, and Washington Tapers) and the West Division (hosting the Hawaii Chiefs, Kansas City Steers, Los Angeles Jets, and San Francisco Saints).

Saperstein placed the Los Angeles Jets to take on the transplanted Lakers. He got Bill Sharman as coach and signed former NBA players Larry Friend and George Yardley to give the team instant credibility. The idea backfired; the Jets did not last the season.

==George Steinbrenner==
In Cleveland, Steinbrenner&#x27;s coach was John McLendon, who became the first African-American coach of a major pro basketball team. He was hired by Pipers&#x27; general manager, Mike Cleary, later the Executive Director of the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics. McLendon had several of his star players from Tennessee State such as John Barnhill and Ben Warley, plus several former Akron Wingfoots, such as Johnny Cox and Jimmy Darrow, who had won the AAU National Championship the year before. In a game against the Hawaii Chiefs, Steinbrenner sold player Grady McCollum to the Chiefs at halftime. McLendon chafed at Steinbrenner&#x27;s interference and quit in midseason, following the team&#x27;s return from playing in Hawaii. Steinbrenner immediately named Sharman, from the recently defunct Jets, as his coach, and the Pipers went on to win the only ABL title in the league&#x27;s brief history.

==Jerry Lucas==
Steinbrenner signed All-American Jerry Lucas to a contract worth $40,000. With the Lucas signing, Steinbrenner had a secret deal with NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff. The Pipers would merge with the Kansas City Steers and join the NBA. A schedule was printed for the 1963–64 NBA season with the Pipers playing the New York Knicks in the first game. The gambit worked, but the ABL sued to block the move, and as a result Steinbrenner had a team and no league. Instead of returning to the ABL, Steinbrenner folded his tent. This chicanery masked a series of other ABL moves.

==Relocation==
The Hawaii Chiefs drew well, but other teams felt the cost of air travel was prohibitive, resulting in scheduling that saw the Eastern teams playing all of their games in Hawaii within a 5-6 day period and vice versa. After that first season, the Chiefs relocated to Long Beach, California. The San Francisco Saints escaped head-to-head competition with the newly relocated San Francisco Warriors by heading to Oakland. Paul Cohen, who secretly owned the Pittsburgh team as well as officially owning the Tapers, moved the Tapers again from New York, where they had been an NABL powerhouse for years, to Philadelphia, where he hoped to fill the void of the move of the Warriors (with Wilt Chamberlain) from Philadelphia to San Francisco.

The radical changes, combined with uneven attendance (although some teams, such as the Kansas City Steers, drew well), and no fresh capital from new owners, caused Saperstein and Cohen to decide to throw in the towel with the close of 1962 on December 31. The league that pioneered the three-point shot and the wider foul line (both eventually adopted by the rest of the basketball world) was gone. After the ABL folded, Steinbrenner had $125,000 in debts and personal losses of $2 million.

==Drafts==
During the new ABL&#x27;s existence, Abe Saperstein and the league would compete with the NBA by creating their own draft system against the NBA draft system of that era in time. They would only have two whole ABL drafts to work with during their existence before prematurely shutting down the league in 1962.
===1961 ABL draft===
The inaugural ABL draft took place at Chicago, Illinois on March 19, 1961, over a week before the 1961 NBA draft began. The ABL proved to be a helpful alternative for some players that had been implicated in the 1961 NCAA University Division men&#x27;s basketball gambling scandal (as well as the CCNY point-shaving scandal in the case of Bill Spivey), as a select few players like Tony Jackson and Connie Hawkins (who would not be drafted there, but would sign up with the ABL following this draft) would manage to see professional playing time they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have due to their bans from the NBA at the time. Outside of those players, however, the ABL would see scant success from this year’s draft with the players they got, as a vast majority of players would sign with the NBA instead if they weren&#x27;t banned from that league already. Outside of that, only the territorial selections for this year (which every team got two of this year) were officially recorded for each team. While every team got enough picks to showcase entire, proper teams, no known round records were officially held during that period of time, though it was known that Rafer Johnson was drafted in what could technically be considered the first round of that draft (even though he&#x27;s officially considered to be a territorial pick) by the Los Angeles Jets and he would go into the 1956 &amp; 1960 Summer Olympics for the decathlon.

===1962 ABL draft===
The second ABL draft took place at Chicago, Illinois on March 25, 1962, this time being two days before the NBA completed their draft. It would also prove to be their final draft in general due to a combination of a failure to persuade top-tier players to join the competing ABL instead of the NBA, financial struggles with the ABL in general, and the notion that one of their teams intended on leaving the ABL to join the NBA instead, which showcased greater instability in mind (especially with a few of the ABL&#x27;s teams already moving elsewhere following their first season&#x27;s completion and the Los Angeles Jets later folding before the upcoming season began). Much like last year&#x27;s draft, each team had two territorial draft picks to select players with, though the Long Beach Chiefs (who were still named the Hawaii Chiefs at the time) could not find any suitable players that fit the territorial distinction this time around, while the Kansas City Steers and Oakland Oaks (known as the San Francisco Saints at the time) could only get one territorial selection at hand. However, unlike last year&#x27;s draft, which held no known records of rounds for each team in the draft, they did keep record of at least the first round before not keeping record of any other rounds afterward (including the first names of at least two players selected), though there was a known record for Cornell Green going to what could be considered the second round by the Hawaii Chiefs despite him later joining the NFL for the Dallas Cowboys instead. As such, excluding territorial selections, the #1 pick of that year&#x27;s draft in the ABL would become UCLA&#x27;s John Green by the Los Angeles Jets, who would later fold operations before their upcoming season began alongside the Cleveland Pipers franchise, with Cleveland folding following their failed attempt to transfer into the NBA.

<doc id="240995" wikidata="Q594199" url="?curid=240995" title="Blancmange (band)">
<text>Blancmange () are an English synth-pop band formed in Harrow, London, in 1979. The band were a duo for much of their career, composed of Neil Arthur (vocals) and Stephen Luscombe (keyboards). They came to prominence in the early 1980s, releasing four UK top-20 singles: &quot;Living on the Ceiling&quot;, &quot;Waves&quot;, &quot;Blind Vision&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. They released three studio albums during that decade: &quot;Happy Families&quot; (1982), &quot;Mange Tout&quot; (1984) and &quot;Believe You Me&quot; (1985).&lt;br&gt;

The duo amicably broke up in 1986 but reformed in the late 2000s, and in 2011 released their fourth studio album, &quot;Blanc Burn&quot;. Luscombe left following the release due to ill health, and since then Arthur alone has continued to perform under the Blancmange name, releasing nine new studio albums along with a re-recording of the band&#x27;s debut studio album, titled &quot;Happy Families Too...&quot; (2013). He has also been involved in a further three collaborative albums as Fader (with Benge) and Near Future (with Jez Bernholz).

==Biography==

===Formation===
Blancmange was formed in Harrow, London, in 1979 by lead vocalist Neil Arthur (born 15 June 1958, Darwen, Lancashire), instrumentalists Stephen Luscombe (born 29 October 1954, Hillingdon, Middlesex) and Laurence Stevens. Stevens left shortly after the band was formed, and Arthur and Luscombe continued as a duo. The group&#x27;s name derived from the dessert of the same name. The duo released their first EP, &quot;Irene and Mavis&quot;, the following year, but their first real exposure came via the track &quot;Sad Day&quot; on the compilation album &quot;Some Bizzare Album&quot; (1981), alongside acts such as Soft Cell and Depeche Mode. This led to them signing a recording contract with London Records. In December 1981 they supported Japan on their &quot;Visions of China&quot; UK tour.

===Success===
The duo found minor success with their 1982 double A-sided single, &quot;God&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;ve Seen the Word&quot;, which peaked at no. 65 in the UK. This was followed by &quot;Feel Me&quot;, which peaked at no. 46. Later that year, they broke through with &quot;Living on the Ceiling&quot;, which reached no. 7 on the UK Singles Chart and was an international hit. Their debut studio album, &quot;Happy Families&quot; (which featured a sleeve painting in the style of Louis Wain and of the cover artwork of Enid Blyton&#x27;s books), also reached the top 30.

Further hits followed with &quot;Waves&quot; (no. 19), &quot;Blind Vision&quot; (no. 10), &quot;That&#x27;s Love, That It Is&quot; (no. 33) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; (no. 8), while their second studio album &quot;Mange Tout&quot; (1984) also reached no. 8 in the UK Albums Chart. The album featured a cover version of ABBA&#x27;s &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot;, which reached no. 22 in the UK (slightly higher than Abba&#x27;s original less than two years earlier). However, after this, the band&#x27;s fortunes declined. Their 1985 single &quot;What&#x27;s Your Problem&quot; only reached no. 40, and the subsequent studio album &quot;Believe You Me&quot; (1985) spent only two weeks in the UK Albums Chart, peaking at no. 54. The duo announced that they were breaking up in June 1986 after a Greenpeace concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

Luscombe released an album of Indian-influenced music, &quot;New Demons&quot;, with Pandit Dinesh, Peter Culshaw, Priya Khajuria and Asha Bhosle under the name West India Company, in 1989. Meanwhile, Arthur released his debut solo studio album, &quot;Suitcase&quot;, in 1994, which spawned the singles &quot;One Day, One Time&quot; (UK No. 80, 1992) and &quot;I Love I Hate&quot; (UK No. 50, 1994). In 2008, Edsel re-released the three studio albums as expanded versions.

===Reformed===
Following a gap of a quarter of a century, Blancmange reunited and released their fourth studio album, &quot;Blanc Burn&quot;, in March 2011. After suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm, Luscombe was forced to leave the band. Since then Arthur elected to continue recording and performing as Blancmange, with the assistance of session musicians.

Blancmange performed a UK tour in November 2013, during which they played their debut studio album &quot;Happy Families&quot; (1982) in its entirety at each show. They also released a new album, &quot;Happy Families Too...&quot;, featuring updated recordings of the original tracks from their 1982 debut album. Initially the new album was only available to buy on the tour, but a digital download followed and a physical CD was released on 7 April 2014 which included four brand new remixes.

On 2 December 2014, the official Blancmange website announced details of a new studio album for release on 23 March 2015 on Cherry Red Records. The album, &quot;Semi Detached&quot;, contains ten tracks. On 9 March 2015, the first single from &quot;Semi Detached&quot;, &quot;Paddington&quot;, was released as a digital download. The second single from the album, &quot;Useless&quot;, was announced for release on 11 May 2015.

On 23 April 2015, Blancmange announced a new album of instrumental music titled &quot;Nil by Mouth&quot;. This release was initially only available for purchase at the band&#x27;s two shows at London&#x27;s Red Gallery in May 2015. It subsequently became available as a CD through the official Blancmange website on 25 September 2015. On 29 May 2015, Blancmange announced the release of their cover of Can&#x27;s &quot;I Want More&quot; as a limited edition 12&quot; record for Record Store Day, making it the third single from &quot;Semi Detached&quot;.

&quot;Commuter 23&quot;, a studio album containing 14 tracks, was released on 11 March 2016. On 20 March 2017, the band announced on their website that a new studio album, &quot;Unfurnished Rooms,&quot; would be released on 22 September 2017. On 23 June 2017, Fader, a new musical project between Neil Arthur and Benge, released their debut studio album, &quot;First Light&quot;. It was preceded by a single, &quot;I Prefer Solitude&quot;, on 7 June 2017. In August 2017, Edsel Records released the 9-CD boxset &quot;The Blanc Tapes&quot; that expanded each of the three 1980s albums over three discs with additional material and liner notes by Neil Arthur.

In February 2018, Near Future, another side project comprising Neil Arthur and Jez Bernholz (from Gazelle Twin), announced they will release their debut studio album, &quot;Ideal Home&quot;, on 25 May 2018. In April 2018, Blancmange announced a forthcoming studio album, &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, and a UK tour in November. In July 2019, &quot;In Shadow&quot;, the second studio album by the Fader project (Neil Arthur and Benge), was announced for release on 18 October 2019.

<text>In cryptography, CAST-128 (alternatively CAST5) is a symmetric-key block cipher used in a number of products, notably as the default cipher in some versions of GPG and PGP. It has also been approved for Government of Canada use by the Communications Security Establishment. The algorithm was created in 1996 by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares using the CAST design procedure.

Another member of the CAST family of ciphers, CAST-256 (a former AES candidate) was derived from CAST-128. According to some sources, the CAST name is based on the initials of its inventors, though Bruce Schneier reports the authors&#x27; claim that &quot;the name should conjure up images of randomness&quot;.

CAST-128 is a 12- or 16-round Feistel network with a 64-bit block size and a key size of between 40 and 128 bits (but only in 8-bit increments). The full 16 rounds are used when the key size is longer than 80 bits.

Components include large 8×32-bit S-boxes based on bent functions, key-dependent rotations, modular addition and subtraction, and XOR operations. There are three alternating types of round function, but they are similar in structure and differ only in the choice of the exact operation (addition, subtraction or XOR) at various points.

Although Entrust holds a patent on the CAST design procedure, CAST-128 is available worldwide on a royalty-free basis for commercial and non-commercial uses.

<doc id="240999" wikidata="Q744528" url="?curid=240999" title="D. Boon">
<text>Dennes Dale Boon (April 1, 1958 – December 22, 1985), also known as D. Boon, was an American musician, best known as the guitarist, singer and songwriter of the punk rock trio Minutemen (formed by previous members of the Reactionaries).

He was born on April 1, 1958, in San Pedro, California, and formed Minutemen in 1980 with bassist Mike Watt and drummer George Hurley. Minutemen were known for their politically-charged lyrics and energetic, fast-paced music, and they released several influential records during their career.

Boon died in an automobile accident on December 22, 1985, at the age of 27. Despite his early death, Boon&#x27;s contributions to punk rock and independent music have been widely recognized. He is remembered as an important figure in the history of these genres.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Dennes Dale Boon was born in San Pedro, California, on April 1, 1958. His father, a navy veteran, worked installing radios in Buick cars, and the Boons lived in former World War II barracks that had been converted into public housing.

According to childhood friend and future bandmate Mike Watt, Boon was unfamiliar with popular music and had grown up listening to Buck Owens and Creedence Clearwater Revival. Watt introduced Boon to Blue Öyster Cult and the Who. Urged by Boon&#x27;s mother, Boon and Watt began to learn to play instruments.

Boon&#x27;s mother taught D. to play the guitar and suggested Watt learn to play bass. They learned to play by copying songs from their favorite bands&#x27; records. Boon took a few lessons from local teacher Roy Mendez Lopez who taught him rock as well as flamenco and classical.

As a teenager, Boon began painting and signed his works &quot;D. Boon&quot;, partly because &quot;D&quot; was his slang for cannabis, partly after Daniel Boone, but mostly because it was similar to E. Bloom, Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist.

===The Reactionaries===
Boon formed his first band, the Reactionaries, with Watt in 1978. The band&#x27;s members were lead vocalist Martin Tamburovich, Boon on guitar, bassist Watt, and drummer George Hurley. The Reactionaries existed for most of 1978 and 1979, practicing regularly but rarely if ever performing live.

After only seven months, Boon and Watt broke the band up feeling that the traditional frontman-style band was &quot;bourgeois&quot;.

===Minutemen===
Boon formed Minutemen in January 1980 with former Reactionaries Mike Watt on bass and Frank Tonche on drums. Tonche was soon replaced by former Reactionaries drummer George Hurley. Their best-known album is &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime,&quot; an album that in 2012 was listed at number 77 by Slant Magazine on their list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. Their first live gig was as an opening band for Black Flag, and released records for labels such as SST Records, New Alliance Records, and Enigma Records.

The band would come to an abrupt end with Boon&#x27;s death, but have left a lasting impact on the punk scene. They were described by Billboard magazine as &quot;provocative art-punk minimalists&quot;, and have also inspired punk and rock bands such as Wire, Gang of Four, the Pop Group, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Urinals.

===Death===
Minutemen continued until December 22, 1985, when Boon was killed in a van accident in the Arizona desert on a desolate stretch of Interstate 10, just west of the small town of Centennial. Because he had been sick with fever, Boon was lying down in the rear of the van without a seatbelt, while his longtime girlfriend Linda Kite drove. The van&#x27;s rear axle broke and the van ran off the road. Boon was thrown out the back door of the van and died instantly from a broken neck. He was 27 years old.

Boon&#x27;s death caused the band to immediately dissolve, though Watt and Hurley would form the band Firehose soon after. The live album &quot;Ballot Result&quot; was released in 1987, two years after Boon&#x27;s death.

==Musical style==
Boon&#x27;s guitar sound is very distinctive: he rarely used distortion and frequently set the equalization on his amplifier so that only the treble frequencies were heard – the bass and mid range frequencies would be turned off completely. His favorite electric guitar was the Fender Telecaster (he owned at least three), though he also used a Stratocaster or Gibson ES-125 or Gibson Melody Maker at various points, and his preferred amplifier was a Fender Twin Reverb.

His style had a heavy influence from funk and blues, which was very different from other hardcore punk bands in the 1980s. Boon&#x27;s solos were often idiosyncratic and used odd rhythms or scales that were influenced by jazz or his early study of classical guitar.

==Artwork==
Boon is responsible for the writing and composition of Minutemen&#x27;s most anthemic songs, in contrast to Watt&#x27;s more abstract or stream of consciousness lyrics. Songs composed by Boon include &quot;This Ain&#x27;t No Picnic&quot;, &quot;Corona&quot;, &quot;The Price of Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Courage&quot;. A lifelong visual artist, Boon also created drawings or paintings for the Minutemen releases &quot;Joy&quot;, &quot;The Punch Line&quot;, &quot;The Politics of Time&quot;, &quot;Project: Mersh&quot; and &quot;3-Way Tie (For Last)&quot;.

==Legacy==
Since the first Firehose album, Mike Watt has dedicated every record he has worked on – be it Firehose, solo, or otherwise – to D. Boon&#x27;s memory. A song on Watt&#x27;s semi-autobiographical 1997 album &quot;Contemplating the Engine Room,&quot; &quot;The Boilerman&quot;, is about D. Boon; on the recording itself, guitarist Nels Cline plays one of Boon&#x27;s last Telecaster guitars, which Watt is in possession of. Watt also mentions his fallen friend in Firehose&#x27;s &quot;Disciples of the 3-Way&quot; (&quot;Mr. Machinery Operator&quot;) and his own &quot;Burstedman&quot; (&quot;The Secondman&#x27;s Middle Stand&quot;).

Boon has been paid tribute by American alternative band Stigmata-A-Go-Go with the song &quot;D. Boon&quot;, from its 1994 album &quot;It&#x27;s All True,&quot; Uncle Tupelo with a different song &quot;D. Boon&quot; from its 1991 album &quot;Still Feel Gone,&quot; and Centro-matic&#x27;s song &quot;D.Boon-Free (A Ninth Grade Crime)&quot; off &quot;The Static vs. The Strings Vol. 1&quot;. His story is also told in the documentary &quot;We Jam Econo&quot;.

In 2003, former D. Boon roommate Richard Derrick released the CD &quot;D. Boon and Friends,&quot; a collection of jam session tapes he recorded with D. Boon, and rare Boon solo performances, as the first release on his Box-O-Plenty Records label. Mike Watt authorized the release and provided technical assistance and liner notes.

He is #89 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time: David Fricke&#x27;s Picks.

In his review of the band&#x27;s last album, music critic Robert Christgau described the death of Boon as &quot;a rock death that for wasted potential has Lennon and Hendrix for company&quot;, adding that &quot;after seven fairly amazing years he was just getting started. Shit, shit, shit.&quot;

<text>Carcharhiniformes , commonly known as ground sharks, are the largest order of sharks, with over 270 species. They include a number of common types, such as catsharks, swellsharks, and requiem sharks.

Members of this order are characterized by the presence of a nictitating membrane over the eye, two dorsal fins, an anal fin, and five gill slits.

The families in the order Carcharhiniformes are expected to be revised; recent DNA studies show that some of the conventional groups are not monophyletic.

The oldest members of the order appeared during the Middle-Late Jurassic, which have teeth and body forms that are morphologically similar to living catsharks. Carchariniformes first underwent major diversification during the Late Cretaceous, initially as mostly small-sized forms, before radiating into medium and large body sizes during the Cenozoic.

==Families==
Eschmeyer&#x27;s Catalog of Fishes classifies the Carcharhiniformes into two suborders and nine families:
*Suborder Scyliorhinoidei
**Family Scyliorhinidae (catsharks)
*Suborder Carcharhinoidei
**Family Atelomycteridae (coloured catsharks)
**Family Pentanchidae (deepwater catsharks)
**Family Dichichthyidae (bristle sharks)
**Family Pseudotriakidae (false catsharks)
**Family Proscylliidae (finback catsharks)
**Family Leptochariidae (barbeled houndsharks)
**Family Triakidae (houndsharks)
***Subfamily Triakinae (smouth-hounds)
***Subfamily Galeorhininae (school sharks)
**Family Hemigaleidae (weasel sharks)
**Family Carcharhinidae (requiem sharks)
**Family Galeocerdonidae (tiger sharks)
**Family Sphyrnidae (hammerhead sharks)

<text>Fuzhou is the capital of Fujian, China. The city lies between the Min River estuary to the south and the city of Ningde to the north. Together, Fuzhou and Ningde make up the Mindong linguistic and cultural region.

Fuzhou&#x27;s population was 8,291,268 as of the 2020 Chinese census. Like other prefecture-level cities in China, its administrative area contains both urban and rural areas: in 2020, 72.49% of inhabitants (6,010,242) were urban, while 27.51% (2,281,026) were rural. As of 31 December 2018, the total population was estimated at 7,740,000 whom 4,665,000 lived in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made of five urban districts plus Minhou County.
 In 2015, Fuzhou was ranked as the 10th fastest growing metropolitan area in the world by Brookings Institution. Fuzhou is listed as No. 20 in the China Integrated City Index 2016&#x27;s total ranking, a study conducted by the National Development and Reform Commission.

Fuzhou is also a major city for scientific research, appearing in the global top 50 cities as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is home to several major universities, notably Fuzhou University, one of China&#x27;s key universities and other public universities, including Fujian Normal University and Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.

==Names==
The &quot;Yuanhe Maps and Records of Prefectures and Counties&quot;, a Chinese geographical treatise published in the 9th century, says that Fuzhou&#x27;s name came from Mount &quot;Futo&quot; a mountain northwest of the city. The mountain&#x27;s name was then combined with &quot;-zhou&quot;, meaning &quot;settlement&quot; or &quot;prefecture&quot;, in a manner similar to many other Chinese cities. During the Warring States period, the area of Fuzhou was sometimes referred to as &quot;Ye&quot; (), and Fuzhou was incorporated into China proper during Qin dynasty. The city&#x27;s name was changed numerous times between the 3rd and 9th centuries before finally settling on Fuzhou in 948. In Chinese, the city is sometimes referred to by the poetic nickname &quot;Rongcheng&quot; (; Foochow Romanized: ), .

In older English publications, the name is variously romanized as Foochow, Foo-Chow, Fuchow, Fūtsu, Fuh-Chow, Hock Chew, and Hokchew.

==History==
===Pre-Qin history (before 221 BC)===

The remains of two Neolithic cultures—the Huqiutou Culture (), from around 5000 BC, and the Tanshishan Culture (), from around 3000 BC—have been discovered and excavated in the Fuzhou area. During the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC), Chinese began referring to the modern Fujian area as Min Yue (), suggesting that the native inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Yue peoples, a diverse population of non-Chinese tribes who once inhabited most of southern China. In 306 BC, the Yue Kingdom (present-day Zhejiang) fell to the state of Chu. Han dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that the surviving members of the Yue royal family fled south to what is now Fujian, where they settled alongside the native Yue people, joining Chinese and Yue culture to create Minyue. 

===Qin and Han dynasties (221 BC – AD 206)===

The First Emperor of Qin unified ancient China in 221 BC and desired to bring the southern and southeast regions under Chinese rule. The Qin dynasty organized its territory into &quot;Commanderies&quot; ()—roughly equivalent to a province or prefecture—and the Fujian area was organized as Minzhong Commandery (). The area seems to have continued mostly independent of Chinese control for the next century. The Han dynasty followed the short-lived Qin, and Emperor Gaozu of Han declared both Minyue and neighboring Nanyue to be autonomous vassal kingdoms. In 202 BC, Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed a leader named Wuzhu (; Old Chinese: &#x27;) as King of Minyue, and a walled city called Ye (; Old Chinese: &#x27;; literally: Beautiful) was built. The founding of Ye in 202 BC has become the traditional founding date of the city of Fuzhou.

In 110 BC, the armies of Emperor Wu of Han defeated the Minyue kingdom&#x27;s armies during the Han–Minyue War and annexed its territory and people into China. Many Minyue citizens were forcibly relocated into the Jianghuai area, and the Yue ethnic group was mostly assimilated into the Chinese, causing a sharp decline in Ye&#x27;s inhabitants. The area was eventually re-organized as a county in 85 BC.

===Three Kingdoms to Sui dynasty (200–618)===
During the Three Kingdoms period, southeast China was nominally under the control of Eastern Wu, and the Fuzhou area had a shipyard for the coastal and Yangtze River fleets. In 282, during the Jin dynasty, two artificial lakes known simply as the East Lake and West Lake were constructed in Ye, as well as a canal system. The core of modern Fuzhou grew around these three water systems, though the East and West Lakes no longer exist. In 308, during the War of the Eight Princes at the end of the Jin dynasty, the first large-scale migration of Chinese immigrants moved to the south and southeast of China began, followed by subsequent waves during later periods of warfare or natural disaster in the Chinese heartland. The administrative and economic center of the Fujian area was still the Ye area during the Sui dynasty (581–618).

===Tang to the Ten Kingdoms era (618–960)===
In 725, the city was formally renamed &quot;Fuzhou&quot;. Throughout the mid-Tang dynasty, Fuzhou&#x27;s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland such as the An Lushan Rebellion and Huang Chao Rebellion, prompting another wave of northerners to immigrate to the modern-day Northern Min and Eastern Min areas. In 879, a large part of the city was captured by the army of Huang Chao during their rebellion against the Tang government. In 893, the warlord brothers Wang Chao and Wang Shenzhi captured Fuzhou in a rebellion against the Tang dynasty, successfully gaining control of the entire Fujian Province and eventually proclaiming their founding of an independent kingdom they called the Min Kingdom in 909. The Wang brothers enticed more immigrants from the north, though their kingdom only survived until 945. In 978, Fuzhou was incorporated into the newly founded Song dynasty, though their control of the mountainous regions was tenuous.

Fuzhou prospered during the Tang dynasty. Buddhism was quickly adopted by citizens who quickly built many Buddhist temples in the area.

===Song era (960–1279)===
Fuzhou underwent a major dramatic surge in its refined culture and educational institutions throughout the Song dynasty as Fuzhou produced 10 Fuzhounese zhuangyuan scholars (scholar who is ranked the top first place in the imperial examinations), a large number for a city in the country during that dynasty.

The &quot;Hualin&quot; Temple (, not to be confused with the temple of the same name in Guangzhou), founded in 964, is one of the oldest and surviving wooden structures in China. New city walls were built in 282, 901, 905, and 974, so the city had many layers of walls – more so than the Chinese capital. Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty ordered the destruction of all the walls in Fuzhou in 978 but new walls were rebuilt later. The latest was built in 1371. During the Southern Song dynasty, Fuzhou became more prosperous; many scholars came to live and work. Among them were Zhu Xi, the most celebrated Chinese philosopher after Confucius, and Xin Qiji, the greatest composer of the ci form of poetry.

Marco Polo, an Italian guest of the Emperor Kubilai, transcribed, after the conventions of Italian orthography, the place name as &quot;Fugiu&quot;. This was not the local Min pronunciation but that of the mandarin administrative class.

According to Odoric of Pordenone, Fuzhou had the biggest chickens in the world.

===Ming dynasty (1368–1644)===
Between 1405 and 1433, a fleet of the Ming Imperial navy under Admiral Zheng He sailed from Fuzhou to the Indian Ocean seven times; on three occasions the fleet landed on the east coast of Africa. Before the last sailing, Zheng erected a stele dedicated to the goddess Tian-Fei (Matsu) near the seaport.

The Ming government gave a monopoly over Philippine trade to Fuzhou, which at times was shared with Quanzhou.

Galeote Pereira, a Portuguese soldier and trader, was taken prisoner during the pirate extermination campaign of 1549 and imprisoned in Fuzhou. Later transferred to a form of internal exile elsewhere in the province, Pereira escaped to Langbaijiao in 1553. The record of his experiences in the Ming Empire, logged by the Jesuits at Goa in 1561, was the first non-clerical account of China to reach the West since Marco Polo.

The Ryukyu Kingdom established an embassy in Fuzhou.

===Qing dynasty (1644–1912)===

In 1839, Lin Zexu, who himself was a Fuzhou native, was appointed by the Daoguang Emperor to enforce the imperial ban on the opium trade in Canton. His unsuccessful actions, however, precipitated the disastrous First Opium War with Great Britain, and Lin, who had become a scapegoat for China&#x27;s failure in war, was exiled to the northwestern section of the empire. The Treaty of Nanjing (1842), which put an end to the conflict, made Fuzhou (then known to Westerners as Foochow) one of five Chinese treaty ports, and it became completely open to Western merchants and missionaries.
Fuzhou was one of the most important Protestant mission fields in China. On January 2, 1846, the first Protestant missionary, Rev. Stephen Johnson (missionary) from ABCFM, entered the city and soon set up the first missionary station there. ABCFM was followed by the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society that was led by Revs. M. C. White and J. D. Collins, who reached Fuzhou in early September 1847. The Church Missionary Society also arrived in the city in May 1850. These three Protestant agencies remained in Fuzhou until the communist revolution in China in the 1950s, leaving a rich heritage in Fuzhou&#x27;s Protestant culture. They supported the creation of hospitals and schools, including the Woolston Memorial Hospital, run by the American-trained Hü King Eng.

On August 23, 1884, the Battle of Fuzhou broke out between the French Far East Fleet and the Fujian Fleet of the Qing dynasty. As the result, the Fujian Fleet, one of the four Chinese regional fleets, was destroyed completely in Mawei Harbor.

=== Republic of China ===
On November 8, 1911, revolutionaries staged an uprising in Fuzhou. After an overnight street battle, the Qing army surrendered.

====Revolutionary Republic====
On November 22, 1933, Eugene Chen and the leaders of the National Revolutionary Army&#x27;s 19th Army set up the short-lived People&#x27;s Revolutionary Government of Republican China. Blockaded by Chiang Kai-shek and left without support from the nearby Soviet Republic of China, the PRGRC collapsed within two months.

====Japanese occupation====
With the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, hostilities commenced in Fujian Province. Xiamen (Amoy) fell to a Japanese landing force on May 13, 1938. The fall of Amoy instantly threatened the security of Fuzhou. On May 23, Japanese ships bombarded Mei-Hua, Huang-chi and Pei-Chiao while Japanese planes continued to harass Chinese forces. Between May 31 and June 1, Chinese gunboats &quot;Fu-Ning&quot;, &quot;Chen-Ning&quot; and &quot;Suming&quot; defending the blockade line in the estuary of the Min River were successively bombed and sunk. Meanwhile, the Chinese ship &quot;Chu-Tai&quot; berthed at Nan-Tai was damaged. The Chinese Navy&#x27;s Harbor Command School, barracks, shipyard, hospital and marine barracks at Ma-Wei were successively bombed. Fuzhou is recorded as having fallen to Japanese forces in 1938.

The extent of Japanese command and control of the city of Fuzhou itself as opposed to the port at Mawei and the Min River Estuary is uncertain. By 1941 (5/7), the city is recorded as having returned to Nationalist control. The British Consulate in Fuzhou is noted as operational from 1941 to 1944 after the United Kingdom Declaration of War on Japan in December 1941. Western visitors to Fuzhou in the period 1941–1944 include the Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett in 1942 and the British scientist Joseph Needham in May 1944. Both visitors record the presence of a British Consul and a Fuzhou Club comprising western businessmen.

In &quot;The Man Who Loved China: The Fantastic Story of the Eccentric Scientist Who Unlocked the Mysteries of the Middle Kingdom&quot;, author Simon Winchester relates the visit of Dr Needham in 1944. Needham encountered the American government agent (John Caldwell) and the British SIS agent (Murray MacLehose working undercover as the British Vice-Consul in Fuzhou) involved in aid to the Nationalist resistance to Japanese forces in Fujian Province.

As part of Operation Ichi-Go (1944), the last large-scale Japanese offensive in China in World War II, Japanese troops intended to isolate Fuzhou and the Fujian Province corridor to Nationalist forces in western China and the wartime capital of Chongqing. One account of Japanese troops re-taking of Fuzhou city itself is narrated by American naval officer, Houghton Freeman. The date is given as October 5, 1944.

Fuzhou remained under Japanese control until May 18, 1945, months before the atomic bombings.

Following the restoration of Republic control (1946), the administration divisions of Fuzhou were annexed, and administration level was promoted from county-level to city-level officially.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Fuzhou was occupied by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army with little resistance on 17 August 1949. In the 1950s, the city was on the front line of the conflict with the KMT in Taiwan, as hostile KMT aircraft frequently bombed the city. The bombing on 20 January 1955 was the most serious one, killing hundreds of people.

Fuzhou was also involved in violent mass chaos during the Cultural revolution. Different groups of Red Guards fought with each other using guns on the streets of the city, and even attacking the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

Under the reform and opening policy since the late 1970s, Fuzhou has developed rapidly. In 1982, Fuzhou became the first city in China where the stored program control was introduced, which marked a milestone in the history of telecommunications in China. In 1984, Fuzhou was chosen as one of the first branches of Open Coastal Cities by the Central Government.

In 1990, Xi Jinping served as the Secretary of the CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee. He proposed the Fuzhou 3820 Project to establish Fuzhou as the political economic cultural educational transportation and technological center of Fujian Province and the West Coast Economic Zone of the Taiwan Straits. He also planned the development of Fuzhou for the next hundred years. He believed that, with Guangzhou to the south and Shanghai to the north Fuzhou&#x27;s geographical location was ideal for becoming an international metropolis between the Pearl River Delta and the Yangtze River Delta. He proposed supporting strategies such as the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Anhui Fuzhou Economic Cooperation Zone the Fuzhou Metropolitan Circle, Maritime Fuzhou the Minjiang Estuary Golden Triangle and a Modern International City as well as the idea of building a high-speed rail corridor to Taipei. Xi Jinping served as the Secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Committee for more than six years and lived in Fuzhou for nearly thirteen years, developing a deep affection for the city. When he visited Fuzhou again in 2021, he remarked that Fuzhou could make significant contributions to the great rejuvenation and unification of the Chinese nation, noting that the airport in Changle was built to support the city&#x27;s expansion towards the sea.

On December 13, 1993, a raging fire swept through a textile factory in Fuzhou and claimed the lives of 60 workers.

On October 2, 2005, floodwaters from Typhoon Longwang swept away a military school, killing at least 80 paramilitary officers.

==Geography==

Fuzhou is located in the northeast coast of Fujian province, connects jointly northwards with Ningde and Nanping, southwards with Quanzhou and Putian, westwards with Sanming respectively.

==Climate==
Fuzhou has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) influenced by the East Asian monsoon; the summers are long, very hot and humid, and the winters are short, mild and dry. In most years, torrential rain occurs during the monsoon in the second half of May. Fuzhou is also liable to typhoons in late summer and early autumn. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while the annual mean is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 24 percent in March to 54 percent in July, the city receives 1,607 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 25 January 2016 to on 24 July 2022.
Snow is very rare, having covered the ground last times in February 1957, December 1975 and December 1991.

==Administrative divisions==

The administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994, Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: &#x27;) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: &#x27;) counties were promoted to county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of &quot;5 districts and 8 counties&quot; is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou&#x27;s entire area only covers 9.65 percent of Fujian Province.

The city of Fuzhou has direct jurisdiction over 6 districts, 1 county-level city, and 6 counties:

==Culture==

The culture of Fuzhou is distinct from the mainstream inland cultures of central China, and in details vary from other areas of the Chinese coast.

===Language and art===
Besides Mandarin Chinese, the majority local residents of Fuzhou (Fuzhou people) also speak Fuzhounese (), the prestige form of Eastern Min.

Min opera, also known as Fuzhou drama, is one of the major operas in Fujian Province. It enjoys popularity in the Fuzhou area and in neighboring parts of Fujian such as the northeast and northwest areas where the Fuzhou language is spoken, as well as in Taiwan and the Malay Archipelago. It became a fixed opera in the early 20th century. There are more than 1,000 plays of Min opera, most of which originate from folk tales, historical novels, or ancient legends, including such traditional plays as &quot;Making Seal&quot;, &quot;The Purple Jade Hairpin&quot; and &quot;Switching Fairy Peach with Litchi&quot;.

===Religion===

The two traditional mainstream religions practiced in Fuzhou are Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. Traditionally, many people practice both religions simultaneously. The city is also home to many Buddhist monasteries, Taoist temples and Buddhist monks.

Apart from mainstream religions, a number of religious worship sites of various local religions are situated in the streets and lanes of Fuzhou.

The origins of local religion can be dated back centuries. These diverse religions incorporated elements such as gods and doctrines from other religions and cultures, such as totem worship and traditional legends. For example, Monkey King, originated to monkey worship among local ancients, gradually came to embody the God of Wealth in Fuzhou after the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; was issued in Ming dynasty.

As the most popular religion in the Min River Valley, the worship of Lady Linshui is viewed as one of the three most influential local religions in Fujian, the other two being the worship of Mazu and Baosheng Dadi ().

===Local cuisine===
Fuzhou cuisine is most notably one of the four traditional cooking styles of Fujian cuisine, which in turn is one of the eight Chinese regional cuisines. Dishes are light but flavorful, with particular emphasis on umami taste, known in Chinese cooking as &quot;xianwei&quot; (), as well as retaining the original flavor of the main ingredients instead of masking them. In Fuzhou cuisine, the taste is light compared to that of some other Chinese cooking styles, and often have a mixed sweet and sour taste. Soup, served as an indispensable dish in meals, is cooked in various ways with local seasonal fresh vegetables and seafood and often added with local cooking wine ().

Fuzhou is famous for its street food and snacks. Some notable street food dishes include Fuzhou fish balls (), meat-pastry dumplings (), oyster cake (海蛎饼), rice scroll soup (), guong bian (; a kind of mildly savory pastry), Buddha Jumps over the Wall (佛跳墙), and pork floss (). Many of these street food dishes have a long history and their own local legend; an example would be the oyster cake, according Fuzhou local folklore, in the early Qing dynasty, there was a young man who inherited his father&#x27;s dim sum business, despite all his hard works, he only managed to earn enough money to feed himself, not enough to raise and feed a family of his own. One night, he dreamt of a silver-haired elderly man, who told him that he has very good fortune, the young man then asked him what he can do to obtain good luck, the elderly man then floated away. That&#x27;s when the young man notice the setting moon, and after the moon sank under the clouds, rose from the east a golden sun, he was inspired by the dream and invented oyster cake, which is white like the moon before being lowered into hot grease and coming out golden as the morning sun. According to the legend, after the young man made a fortune out of his invention and his oyster cake was imitated by many others, which was passed down till this day. another example of a Fuzhou street food with a long history is rice scroll soup, which became popular in Fuzhou in the early part of the Qing dynasty. As more Fuzhou residents settled overseas, Fuzhou dishes spread to Taiwan, Southeast Asia and the U.S.. For example, one is able to find guong bian and Fuzhou fish balls in Sitiawan in Ipoh, Malaysia while Fuzhou fish balls, meat-pastry dumplings and rice scroll soup can be found in New York&#x27;s Chinatown.

Fuzhou residents also enjoy eating festival foods during traditional Chinese holidays. For example, red and white rice cakes () are served over Chinese New Year, tangyuan (汤圆) during the Lantern Festival, zongzi () during the Dragon Boat Festival, and sweet soy bean powder-covered plain yuanxiao over the winter solstice.

Olive juice is also a much sought-after refreshment. Ganlanzhi (橄榄汁) is cloudy and light yellowish-green in color. Olive trees grown on the Canarium album tree in Fuzhou since the Tang dynasty, it was even approved as a trademark with geographic indication by China in 2010. Not found elsewhere in China, ganlanzhi (橄榄汁) is also a reminder of the many regional differences in China when it comes to food.

===Special crafts===
Bodiless lacquerware (), paper umbrellas and horn combs () are the &quot;Three Treasures&quot; of Fuzhou traditional arts. In addition, bodiless lacquerware, together with cork pictures () and Shoushan stone sculptures () are called &quot;Three Superexcellences&quot; of Fuzhou.

==Media==
&quot;Fuzhou Evening News&quot; (), &quot;Strait Metropolitan Post&quot; and &quot;Southeast Express&quot; () are the three most primary newspapers in the city. &quot;Fuzhou Daily&quot; () is the official newspaper of the Fuzhou Committee of Chinese Communist Party. FZTV, the local municipal television station has four channels. As the capital, the provincial state-owned Fujian Media Group, Fujian Daily Newspaper Group and Straits Publishing &amp; Distributing Group also headquarter here.

==Transportation==

===Airports===

The city is served by Fuzhou Changle International Airport, which replaces Fuzhou Yixu Airport, the old airfield. The former is its main international airport and an air-hub in southeast China, while the latter was turned into a PLA airbase after 1997.

===Railways===

Fuzhou is a railway hub in northern Fujian. The Wenzhou–Fuzhou and Fuzhou–Xiamen Railways form part of the Southeast Coast High-Speed Rail Corridor and can accommodate high-speed trains at speeds of up to . 
The Hefei–Fuzhou High-Speed Railway links the city to Beijing through its nearby inner land province Jiangxi at speeds up to .
The Nanping–Fuzhou Railway and Xiangtang–Putian Railway provide rail access inland. The latter line can carry trains at speeds of . The regional Fuzhou-Mawei Cargo Railway runs from the Fuzhou Railway Station eastward to the port in Mawei District. Fuzhou has two main railway stations, Fuzhou and Fuzhou South. Fuzhou station is often just referred to as Fuzhou station given its central location.

===Metro===

Fuzhou Metro is the first rapid transit system in Fujian province. It has two metro lines in operation and five lines under construction.

Line 1 links the two railway stations of the city. The Fuzhou railway station is located north of the city center, near the North Second Ring Road. Fuzhou South Railway Station, located in Cangshan district, is a key landmark of the New City development scheme, begun in 2007 and completed in 2010. Line 1 was opened on May 18, 2016.

Line 2 runs in the east–west direction of the city, linking the university city and Fuzhou High-Tech Zone in Minhou county, Jinshan Industrial Zone in Cangshan district, and Gushan mountain in Jin&#x27;an district. Line 2 was opened on 26 April 2019.

===Seaport===
Passenger liners regularly sail between ROC&#x27;s Matsu Islands and the port in Mawei District.

A high-speed ferry sails across Taiwan Strait between the port in Pingtan County, the mainland&#x27;s closest point to Taiwan, to Taipei and Taichung, a trip that takes about 3 hours.

====History of Fuzhou port====
In 1867 the Fuzhou seaport was the site of one of China&#x27;s first major experiments with Western technology, when the Fuzhou Navy Yard was established. A shipyard and an arsenal were built under French guidance and a naval school was opened. A naval academy was also established at the shipyard, and it became a center for the study of European languages and technical sciences. The academy, which offered courses in English, French, engineering, and navigation, produced a generation of Western-trained officers, including the famous scholar-reformer Yan Fu (1854–1921).

The yard was established as part of a program to strengthen China in the wake of the country&#x27;s disastrous defeat in the Second Opium War (1856–1860). Most talented students nonetheless continued to pursue a traditional Confucian education, and by the mid-1870s the government began to lose interest in the shipyard, which had trouble securing funds and declined in importance. Fuzhou remained essentially a commercial center and a port until World War II; it had relatively little industry. The port was occupied by the Japanese during 1940–1945.

Since 1949, Fuzhou has grown considerably. Transportation has been improved by the dredging of the Min River for navigation by medium-sized craft upstream to Nanping. In 1956 the railway linking Fuzhou with the interior of the province and with the main Chinese railway system began operation. The port has also been improved; Fuzhou itself is no longer accessible to seagoing ships, but Luoxingta anchorage and the outer harbor at Guantou on the coast of the East China Sea have been modernized and improved. The chief exports are timber, fruits, paper, and foodstuffs.

==Economy==
Industry is supplied with power by a grid running from the Gutian hydroelectric scheme in the mountains to the northwest. The city is a center for commercial banking, designer brands and timber-working, engineering, papermaking, printing, and textile industries. A small iron and steel plant was built in 1958. In 1984 Fuzhou was designated one of China&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; cities in the new open-door policy inviting foreign investments. Handicrafts remain important in the rural areas, and the city is famous for its lacquer and wood products.

Its GDP was ¥75,614 (c. US$12,140) per capita in 2015, ranked no. 52 among 659 Chinese cities.

Fuzhou is undoubtedly the province&#x27;s political, economic and cultural center as well as an industrial center and seaport on the Min River. In 2008, Fuzhou&#x27;s GDP amounted to ¥228.4 billion, an increase of 13 percent.

Manufactured products include chemicals, silk and cotton textiles, iron and steel, and processed food. Among Fuzhou&#x27;s exports are fine lacquerware and handcrafted fans and umbrellas. The city&#x27;s trade is mainly with Chinese coastal ports. Its exports of timber, food products, and paper move through the harbor at Guantou located about downstream.

In 2008, exports reached US$13.6 billion, a growth of 10.4 percent while imports amounted to US$6.8 billion. Total retail sales for the same period came to ¥113.4 billion and per capita GDP grew to ¥33,615. During the same period, Fuzhou approved 155 foreign-invested projects. Contracted foreign investment amounted to US$1.489 billion, while utilized foreign investment increased by 43 percent to US$1.002 billion.

<text>The Heliomonadida (formerly Dimorphida) are a small group of heliozoan amoeboids that are unusual in possessing flagella throughout their life cycle.

==Classification==
Genetic studies place them among the Cercozoa, a group including various other flagellates that form filose pseudopodia. This order has recently been placed into the new class of naked cercozoans called Granofilosea.
There are two genera in this order: 
* &quot;Heliomorpha&quot;, a tiny organism found in freshwater
* the larger &quot;Tetradimorpha&quot;, which is distinguished by having four rather than two flagella.

==Morphology==
Bundles of microtubules, typically in square array, arise from a body near the flagellar bases and support the numerous axopods that project from the cell surface.

Dimorphids have a single nucleus, and mitochondria with tubular cristae.

<doc id="241010" wikidata="Q1410794" url="?curid=241010" title="Fibrinolysis">
<text>Fibrinolysis is a process that prevents blood clots from growing and becoming problematic. Primary fibrinolysis is a normal body process, while secondary fibrinolysis is the breakdown of clots due to a medicine, a medical disorder, or some other cause.

In fibrinolysis, a fibrin clot, the product of coagulation, is broken down. Its main enzyme plasmin cuts the fibrin mesh at various places, leading to the production of circulating fragments that are cleared by other proteases or by the kidney and liver.

==Physiology==

Plasmin is produced in an inactive form, plasminogen, in the liver. Although plasminogen cannot cleave fibrin, it still has an affinity for it, and is incorporated into the clot when it is formed.

Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase are the agents that convert plasminogen to the active plasmin, thus allowing fibrinolysis to occur. t-PA is released into the blood slowly by the damaged endothelium of the blood vessels, such that, after several days (when the bleeding has stopped), the clot is broken down. This occurs because plasminogen became entrapped within the clot when it formed; as it is slowly activated, it breaks down the fibrin mesh. t-PA and urokinase are themselves inhibited by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2). In contrast, plasminogen further stimulates plasmin generation by producing more active forms of both tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase.

α2-Antiplasmin and α2-macroglobulin inactivate plasmin. Plasmin activity is also reduced by thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which modifies fibrin to make it more resistant to the tPA-mediated plasminogen.

==Measurement==
Plasmin breaks down fibrin into soluble parts called fibrin degradation products (FDPs). FDPs compete with thrombin, and thus slow down clot formation by preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. This effect can be seen in the thrombin clotting time (TCT) test, which is prolonged in a person that has active fibrinolysis.

Antibody-antigen technology can measure FDPs and a specific FDP, the D-dimer. This is more specific than the TCT, and confirms that fibrinolysis has occurred. It is therefore used to indicate deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, DIC, and efficacy of treatment in acute myocardial infarction. Alternatively, a more rapid detection of fibrinolytic activity, especially hyperfibrinolysis, is possible with thromboelastometry (TEM) in whole blood, even in patients on heparin. In this assay, increased fibrinolysis is assessed by comparing the TEM profile in the absence or presence of the fibrinolysis inhibitor aprotinin. Clinically, the TEM is useful for near real-time measurement of activated fibrinolysis for at-risk patients, such as those experiencing significant blood loss during surgery.

Testing of overall fibrinolysis can be measured by a euglobulin lysis time (ELT) assay. The ELT measures fibrinolysis by clotting the euglobulin fraction (primarily the fibrinolytic factors fibrinogen, PAI-1, tPA, α2-antiplasmin, and plasminogen) from plasma and then observing the time required for clot dissolution. A shortened lysis time indicates a hyperfibrinolytic state and bleeding risk. Such results can be seen in peoples with liver disease, PAI-1 deficiency or α2-antiplasmin deficiency. Similar results are also seen after administration of desmopressin or after severe stress.

==Role in disease==
Few congenital disorders of the fibrinolytic system have been documented. Nevertheless, excess levels of PAI and α2-antiplasmin have been implicated in metabolic syndrome and various other disease states.

However, acquired disturbance of fibrinolysis (hyperfibrinolysis), is not uncommon. Many trauma patients have an overwhelming activation of tissue factor and thus massive hyperfibrinolysis. Hyperfibrinolysis may occur in other disease states. It could lead to massive bleeding if not diagnosed and treated early enough.

The fibrinolytic system is closely linked to control of inflammation, and plays a role in disease states associated with inflammation. Plasmin, in addition to lysing fibrin clots, also cleaves the complement system component C3, and fibrin degradation products have some vascular permeability inducing effects.

==Pharmacology==
In a process called thrombolysis (the breakdown of a thrombus), fibrinolytic drugs are used. They are given following a heart attack to dissolve the thrombus blocking the coronary artery; experimentally after a stroke to allow blood flow back to the affected part of the brain; and in the event of pulmonary embolism.

Thrombolysis refers to the dissolution of the thrombus due to various agents while fibrinolysis refers specifically to the agents causing fibrin breakdown in the clot.

Antifibrinolytics, such as aminocaproic acid (ε-aminocaproic acid) and tranexamic acid are used as inhibitors of fibrinolysis. Their application may be beneficial in patients with hyperfibrinolysis because they arrest bleeding rapidly if the other components of the haemostatic system are not severely affected. This may help to avoid the use of blood products such as fresh frozen plasma with its associated risks of infections or anaphylactic reactions.

* Anistreplase
* Bromelain
* Desmoteplase
* DNase

<doc id="241014" wikidata="Q17149" url="?curid=241014" title="Scyliorhinidae">
<text>Scyliorhinidae is a family of sharks, one of a few families whose members share the common name catsharks, belonging to the order Carcharhiniformes, the ground sharks. Although they are generally known as catsharks, some species can also be called dogfish due to previous naming. However, a dogfish may generally be distinguished from a catshark as catsharks lay eggs while dogfish have live young. Like most bottom feeders, catsharks feed on benthic invertebrates and smaller fish. They are not harmful to humans. The family is paraphyletic, containing several distinct lineages that do not form a monophyletic group.

== Genera ==

Scyliorhinidae includes the following genera:
* &quot;Cephaloscyllium&quot; 
* &quot;Poroderma&quot; 
* &quot;Scyliorhinus&quot; 

== Anatomy and appearance ==
Scyliorhinidae catsharks may be distinguished by their elongated, cat-like eyes and two small dorsal fins set far back. Most species are fairly small, growing no longer than 80 cm (31 in); a few, such as the nursehound (&quot;Scyliorhinus stellaris&quot;) can reach 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in length. Most of the species have a patterned appearance, ranging from stripes to patches to spots.

Characteristics of genus &quot;Apristurus&quot; are mostly dark bodies, and having a long anal fin that ends in front of where the lower caudal fin begins. The snouts of the species of &quot;Apristurus&quot; are flat. They also present upper and lower labial furrows.

The sonic hedgehog dentition expression is first found as a bilateral symmetrical pattern and is found in certain areas of the embryonic jaw. Sonic hedgehog (a secreted protein that, in humans, is encoded by the SHH gene) is involved in the growth and patterning of different organs. Every 18–38 days the teeth are replaced as is a common characteristic of the developmental process of sharks.

The &quot;swell sharks&quot; of the genus &quot;Cephaloscyllium&quot; have the curious ability to fill their stomachs with water or air when threatened, increasing their girth by a factor of one to three.

Some catsharks, such as the chain catshark are biofluorescent.

== Distribution ==
Scyliorhinidae catsharks are found around seabeds in temperate and tropical seas worldwide, ranging from very shallow intertidal waters to depths of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) or more, such as the members of genus &quot;Apristurus.&quot; The red-spotted catshark lives in the shallower rocky waters ranging from Peru to Chile and migrates to deeper waters during the winter. They are usually restricted to small ranges. Juvenile and adult chain dogfish live on the soft or rocky bottom of the Atlantic from Massachusetts to Nicaragua. Adults tend to live on the soft, sandy bottoms possibly due to their need of egg deposition sites.

== Behaviour ==
Scyliorhinidae includes species that do not undergo long distance migrations because they are poor swimmers. Due to being nocturnal, some species sleep close together in crevices throughout the day and then go hunting at night. Some species such as the small spotted catshark, &quot;Scyliorhinus canicula&quot;, are sexually monomorphic and exhibit habitat segregation, where males and females live in separate areas; males tend to live in open seabeds, while females tend to live in caves. Some species of catsharks may deposit egg cases in structured habitats, which may also act as nurseries for the newly hatched sharks.

== Reproduction ==

Scyliorhinidae includes many species of catsharks, that like the chain dogfish, are oviparous and lay eggs in tough egg cases with curly tendrils at each end, known as &quot;mermaid&#x27;s purses&quot;, for protection, onto the seabed. Almost a year is needed for a catshark to hatch from the egg. Instead of laying the eggs and letting them sit for a year, some species of catsharks hold onto the eggs until a few months before the shark hatches. Some catsharks exhibit ovoviviparity, aplacental viviparous, by holding onto the embryos until they are completely developed and then give live birth. Some species of catsharks mate by biting and holding the female’s pectoral fins and wrestle her into a mating position.

<text>The adrenergic receptors or adrenoceptors are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that are targets of many catecholamines like norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) produced by the body, but also many medications like beta blockers, beta-2 (β2) antagonists and alpha-2 (α2) agonists, which are used to treat high blood pressure and asthma, for example.

Many cells have these receptors, and the binding of a catecholamine to the receptor will generally stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, which is triggered by experiences such as exercise or fear-causing situations. This response dilates pupils, increases heart rate, mobilizes energy, and diverts blood flow from non-essential organs to skeletal muscle. These effects together tend to increase physical performance momentarily.

==History==


By the turn of the 19th century, it was agreed that the stimulation of sympathetic nerves could cause different effects on body tissues, depending on the conditions of stimulation (such as the presence or absence of some toxin). Over the first half of the 20th century, two main proposals were made to explain this phenomenon:

# There were (at least) two different types of neurotransmitters released from sympathetic nerve terminals, or
# There were (at least) two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter.

The first hypothesis was championed by Walter Bradford Cannon and Arturo Rosenblueth, who interpreted many experiments to then propose that there were two neurotransmitter substances, which they called sympathin E (for &#x27;excitation&#x27;) and sympathin I (for &#x27;inhibition&#x27;).

The second hypothesis found support from 1906 to 1913, when Henry Hallett Dale explored the effects of adrenaline (which he called adrenine at the time), injected into animals, on blood pressure. Usually, adrenaline would increase the blood pressure of these animals. Although, if the animal had been exposed to ergotoxine, the blood pressure decreased. He proposed that the ergotoxine caused &quot;selective paralysis of motor myoneural junctions&quot; (i.e. those tending to increase the blood pressure) hence revealing that under normal conditions that there was a &quot;mixed response&quot;, including a mechanism that would relax smooth muscle and cause a fall in blood pressure. This &quot;mixed response&quot;, with the same compound causing either contraction or relaxation, was conceived of as the response of different types of junctions to the same compound.

This line of experiments were developed by several groups, including DT Marsh and colleagues, who in February 1948 showed that a series of compounds structurally related to adrenaline could also show either contracting or relaxing effects, depending on whether or not other toxins were present. This again supported the argument that the muscles had two different mechanisms by which they could respond to the same compound. In June of that year, Raymond Ahlquist, Professor of Pharmacology at Medical College of Georgia, published a paper concerning adrenergic nervous transmission. In it, he explicitly named the different responses as due to what he called α receptors and β receptors, and that the only sympathetic transmitter was adrenaline. While the latter conclusion was subsequently shown to be incorrect (it is now known to be noradrenaline), his receptor nomenclature and concept of &quot;two different types of detector mechanisms for a single neurotransmitter&quot;, remains. In 1954, he was able to incorporate his findings in a textbook, &quot;Drill&#x27;s Pharmacology in Medicine&quot;, and thereby promulgate the role played by α and β receptor sites in the adrenaline/noradrenaline cellular mechanism. These concepts would revolutionise advances in pharmacotherapeutic research, allowing the selective design of specific molecules to target medical ailments rather than rely upon traditional research into the efficacy of pre-existing herbal medicines.

==Categories==

The mechanism of adrenoreceptors. Adrenaline or noradrenaline are receptor ligands to either α1, α2 or β-adrenoreceptors. The α1 couples to Gq, which results in increased intracellular Ca2+ and subsequent smooth muscle contraction. The α2, on the other hand, couples to Gi, which causes a decrease in neurotransmitter release, as well as a decrease of cAMP activity resulting in smooth muscle contraction. The β receptor couples to Gs and increases intracellular cAMP activity, resulting in e.g. heart muscle contraction, smooth muscle relaxation and glycogenolysis.
There are two main groups of adrenoreceptors, α and β, with 9 subtypes in total:
* α receptors are subdivided into α1 (a Gq coupled receptor) and α2 (a Gi coupled receptor)
** α1 has 3 subtypes: α1A, α1B and α1D
** α2 has 3 subtypes: α2A, α2B and α2C
* β receptors are subdivided into β1, β2 and β3. All 3 are coupled to Gs proteins, but β2 and β3 also couple to Gi

Gi and Gs are linked to adenylyl cyclase. Agonist binding thus causes a rise in the intracellular concentration of the second messenger (Gi inhibits the production of cAMP) cAMP. Downstream effectors of cAMP include cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which mediates some of the intracellular events following hormone binding.

===Roles in circulation===
Epinephrine (adrenaline) reacts with both α- and β-adrenoreceptors, causing vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Although α receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by β-adrenoreceptors because there are more peripheral α1 receptors than β-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. However, the opposite is true in the coronary arteries, where β2 response is greater than that of α1, resulting in overall dilation with increased sympathetic stimulation. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), β-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the β2 adrenoreceptor than the α1 adrenoreceptor, producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.

===Subtypes===
Smooth muscle behavior is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below. One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle. Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased contractility and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.
===α receptors===
α receptors have actions in common, but also individual effects. Common (or still receptor unspecified) actions include:
* vasoconstriction
* decreased flow of smooth muscle in gastrointestinal tract

Subtype unspecific α agonists (see actions above) can be used to treat rhinitis (they decrease mucus secretion). Subtype unspecific α antagonists can be used to treat pheochromocytoma (they decrease vasoconstriction caused by norepinephrine).

====α1 receptor====

α1-adrenoreceptors are members of the Gq protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Upon activation, a heterotrimeric G protein, Gq, activates phospholipase C (PLC). The PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which in turn causes an increase in inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The former interacts with calcium channels of endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus changing the calcium content in a cell. This triggers all other effects, including a prominent slow after depolarizing current (sADP) in neurons.

Actions of the α1 receptor mainly involve smooth muscle contraction. It causes vasoconstriction in many blood vessels, including those of the skin, gastrointestinal system, kidney (renal artery) and brain. Other areas of smooth muscle contraction are:
* ureter
* vas deferens
* hair (arrector pili muscles)
* uterus (when pregnant)
* urethral sphincter
* urothelium and lamina propria
* bronchioles (although minor relative to the relaxing effect of β2 receptor on bronchioles)
* blood vessels of ciliary body and (stimulation of dilator pupillae muscles of iris causes mydriasis)

Actions also include glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from adipose tissue and liver; secretion from sweat glands and Na+ reabsorption from kidney.

α1 antagonists can be used to treat:
* hypertension – decrease blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vasoconstriction
* benign prostate hyperplasia – relax smooth muscles within the prostate thus easing urination

====α2 receptor====

The α2 receptor couples to the Gi/o protein. It is a presynaptic receptor, causing negative feedback on, for example, norepinephrine (NE). When NE is released into the synapse, it feeds back on the α2 receptor, causing less NE release from the presynaptic neuron. This decreases the effect of NE. There are also α2 receptors on the nerve terminal membrane of the post-synaptic adrenergic neuron.

Actions of the α2 receptor include:
* decreased insulin release from the pancreas
* increased glucagon release from the pancreas
* contraction of sphincters of the GI-tract
* negative feedback in the neuronal synapses - presynaptic inhibition of norepinephrine release in CNS
* increased platelet aggregation
* decreases peripheral vascular resistance

α2 agonists (see actions above) can be used to treat:
* hypertension – decrease blood pressure-raising actions of the sympathetic nervous system

α2 antagonists can be used to treat:
* impotence – relax penile smooth muscles and ease blood flow
* depression – enhance mood by increasing norepinephrine secretion

===β receptors===
Subtype unspecific β agonists can be used to treat:
* heart failure – increase cardiac output acutely in an emergency
* circulatory shock – increase cardiac output thus redistributing blood volume
* anaphylaxis – bronchodilation

Subtype unspecific β antagonists (beta blockers) can be used to treat:
* heart arrhythmia – decrease the output of sinus node thus stabilizing heart function
* coronary artery disease – reduce heart rate and hence increasing oxygen supply
* heart failure – prevent sudden death related to this condition, which is often caused by ischemias or arrhythmias
* hyperthyroidism – reduce peripheral sympathetic hyper-responsiveness
* migraine – reduce number of attacks
* stage fright – reduce tachycardia and tremor
* glaucoma – reduce intraocular pressure

====β1 receptor====

Actions of the β1 receptor include:
* increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate (positive chronotropic effect), conduction velocity (positive dromotropic effect), stroke volume (by enhancing contractility – positive inotropic effect), and rate of relaxation of the myocardium, by increasing calcium ion sequestration rate (positive lusitropic effect), which aids in increasing heart rate
* increase renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney
* increase ghrelin secretion from the stomach

====β2 receptor====
Actions of the β2 receptor include:
* smooth muscle relaxation throughout many areas of the body, e.g. in bronchi (bronchodilation, see salbutamol), GI tract (decreased motility), veins (vasodilation of blood vessels), especially those to skeletal muscle (although this vasodilator effect of norepinephrine is relatively minor and overwhelmed by α adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction)
* lipolysis in adipose tissue
* anabolism in skeletal muscle
* uptake of potassium into cells
* relax non-pregnant uterus
* relax detrusor urinae muscle of bladder wall
* dilate arteries to skeletal muscle
* glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
* stimulates insulin secretion
* contract sphincters of GI tract
* thickened secretions from salivary glands
* inhibit histamine-release from mast cells
* involved in brain - immune communication

β2 agonists (see actions above) can be used to treat:
* asthma and COPD – reduce bronchial smooth muscle contraction thus dilating the bronchus
* hyperkalemia – increase cellular potassium intake
* preterm birth – reduce uterine smooth muscle contractions

====β3 receptor====

Actions of the β3 receptor include:
* increase of lipolysis in adipose tissue
* relax the bladder

β3 agonists could theoretically be used as weight-loss drugs, but are limited by the side effect of tremors.

<text>The Eurasian chaffinch, common chaffinch, or simply the chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) is a common and widespread small passerine bird in the finch family. The male is brightly coloured with a blue-grey cap and rust-red underparts. The female is more subdued in colouring, but both sexes have two contrasting white wing bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate.

The chaffinch breeds in much of Europe, across the Palearctic to Siberia. The female builds a nest with a deep cup in the fork of a tree. The clutch is typically four or five eggs, which hatch in about 13 days. The chicks fledge in around 14 days, but are fed by both adults for several weeks after leaving the nest. Outside the breeding season, chaffinches form flocks in open countryside and forage for seeds on the ground. During the breeding season, they forage on trees for invertebrates, especially caterpillars, and feed these to their young. They are partial migrants; birds breeding in warmer regions are sedentary, while those breeding in the colder northern areas of their range winter further south.

The eggs and nestlings of the chaffinch are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. Its large numbers and huge range mean that chaffinches are classed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Taxonomy==
The Eurasian chaffinch was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current binomial name, &quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot;. &quot;Fringilla&quot; is the Latin word for finch, while &quot;caelebs&quot; means unmarried or single. Linnaeus remarked that during the Swedish winter, only the female birds migrated south through Belgium to Italy.

The English name comes from the Old English &quot;ceaffinc&quot;, where &quot;ceaf&quot; is &quot;chaff&quot; and &quot;finc&quot; &quot;finch&quot;. Chaffinches were likely given this name because after farmers thresh their crops, these birds sometimes spend weeks picking through heaps of discarded chaff for grain. The chaffinch is one of the many birds depicted in the marginal decoration of the 15th-century English illuminated manuscript the Sherborne Missal. The English naturalist William Turner described the Eurasian chaffinch in his book on birds &quot;Avium praecipuarum&quot;, published in 1544. Although the text is in Latin, Turner gives the English name as chaffinche and lists two folk names: sheld-appel and spink. The word &quot;sheld&quot; is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in shelduck). Appel may be related to &quot;Alp&quot;, an obsolete word for a bullfinch. The name &quot;spink&quot; is probably derived from the bird&#x27;s call note. The names spink and shell apple are among the many folk names listed for the common chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his &quot;Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds&quot; (1885).

The Fringillidae are all seed-eaters with stout conical bills. They have similar skull morphologies, nine large primaries, 12 tail feathers and no crop. In all species, the female builds the nest, incubates the eggs, and broods the young. Finches are divided into two subfamilies, the Carduelinae, containing around 28 genera with 141 species and the Fringillinae containing a single genus, &quot;Fringilla&quot;, with four species: the common chaffinch (&quot;F. coelebs&quot;), the Gran Canaria blue chaffinch (&quot;F. polatzeki&quot;), the Tenerife blue chaffinch (&quot;F. teydea&quot;), and the brambling (&quot;F. montifringilla&quot;). Fringilline finches raise their young almost entirely on arthropods, while the cardueline finches raise their young on regurgitated seeds.

===Subspecies===
A number of subspecies of the Eurasian chaffinch have been described, based principally on the differences in the pattern and colour of the adult male plumage.

Within the &quot;&quot;coelebs&quot; group&quot;, the gradual clinal variation over the large geographic range and the extensive intergradation means that the geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities. The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union lists 11 subspecies from this group, whereas Peter Clement in the Birds of the World lists seven and considers the features of the subspecies &quot;balearica&quot; (Mallorca), &quot;caucasica&quot; (the southern Caucasus), &quot;schiebeli&quot; (southern Greece, Crete and western Turkey), and &quot;tyrrhenica&quot; (Corsica) to fall within the variation of the nominate subspecies. He also suggests that the subspecies &quot;alexandrovi&quot;, &quot;sarda&quot;, &quot;solomkoi&quot;, and &quot;syriaca&quot; may represent variations of the nominate subspecies.

The authors of a 2009 molecular phylogenetic study on the three subspecies that were recognised on the Canary Islands concluded that they are sufficiently distinct in both genotype and phenotype to be considered as separate species within the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot;. They also proposed a revised distribution of the subspecies on the islands in which the birds on La Palma (&quot;palmae&quot;) and El Hierro (&quot;ombrioso&quot;) are grouped together as a single subspecies, while the current &quot;canariensis&quot; subspecies is split into two, with one subspecies occurring only on Gran Canaria and the other on La Gomera and Tenerife. The results of a study published in 2018 confirmed the earlier findings. The authors formerly described the Gran Canaria variety as a subspecies and coined the trinomial name &quot;Fringilla coelebs bakeri&quot;.

==Description==

The Eurasian chaffinch is about long, with a wingspan of and a weight of . The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a black forehead and a blue-grey crown, nape and upper mantle. The rump is a light olive-green; the lower mantle and scapulars form a brown saddle. The side of head, throat and breast are a dull rust-red merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers are dark grey with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail is black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which have white wedges. Each wing has a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a buff-white bar on the secondaries and inner primaries. The flight feathers are black with white on the basal portions of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries have pale yellow fringes on the outer web whereas the outer primaries have a white outer edge.

After the autumn moult, the tips of the new feathers have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or culmen, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.

The male of the subspecies resident in the British Isles (&quot;F. c. gengleri&quot;) closely resembles the nominate subspecies, but has a slightly darker mantle and underparts.

The adult female is much duller in appearance than the male. The head and most of the upperparts are shades of grey-brown. The underparts are paler. The lower back and rump are a dull olive green. The wings and tail are similar to those of the male. The juvenile resembles the female.

===Voice===
Males typically sing two or three different song types, and there are regional dialects also.

The acquisition by the young Eurasian chaffinch of its song was the subject of an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe. Thorpe determined that if the young common chaffinch is not exposed to the adult male&#x27;s song during a certain critical period after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult Eurasian chaffinches, castration eliminates the song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian chaffinch breeds in wooded areas where the July isotherm is between . The breeding range includes most of Europe and extends eastwards across temperate Asia to the Angara River and the southern end of Lake Baikal in Siberia. The Eurasian chaffinch was introduced from Great Britain into several of its overseas territories in the second half of the 19th century. In New Zealand, the Eurasian chaffinch had colonised both the North and South Islands by 1900 and is now one of the most widespread and common passerine species. In South Africa, a very small breeding colony in the suburbs of Constantia, Hout Bay, Pinelands and Camps Bay in Cape Town is the only remnant of another such introduction.

This bird is not migratory in the milder parts of its range, but vacates the colder regions in winter. It forms loose flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with bramblings. It occasionally strays to eastern North America, although some sightings may be escapees.

==Behaviour==


===Breeding===
Eurasian chaffinches first breed when they are 1 year old. They are mainly monogamous and the pair-bond for residential subspecies such as &quot;gengleri&quot; sometimes persists from one year to the next. The date for breeding is dependent on the spring temperature and is earlier in southwest Europe and later in the northeast. In Great Britain, most clutches are laid between late April and the middle of June. A male attracts a female to his territory through song.

Nests are built entirely by the female and are usually located in the fork of a bush or a tree several metres above the ground. The nest has a deep cup and is lined with a layer of thin roots and feathers. The outside is covered with a layer of lichen and spider silk over an inner layer of moss and grass. The eggs are laid in early morning at daily intervals until the clutch is complete. The clutch is typically 4–5 eggs, which are smooth and slightly glossy, but very variable in colour. They range from pale-blueish green to light red with purple-brown blotches, spots or steaks. The average size of an egg is with a weight of . The eggs are incubated for 10–16 days by the female. The chicks are altricial, hatching nearly naked with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents but mainly by the female, who broods them for around six days. They are mainly fed caterpillars. The nestlings fledge 11–18 days after hatching and disperse. The young birds are then assisted with feeding by both parents for a further three weeks. The parents only very rarely start a second brood, but when they do so it is always in a new nest. Juveniles undergo a partial moult at around five weeks of age in which they replace their head, body and many of their covert feathers, but not their primary and secondary flight feathers. After breeding adult birds undergo a complete annual moult which lasts around ten weeks.

In a study carried out in Britain using ring-recovery data, the survival rate for juveniles in their first year was 53 per cent, and the adult annual survival rate was 59 per cent. From these figures the typical lifespan is only 3 years, but the maximum age recorded is 15 years and 6 months for a bird in Switzerland.

===Feeding===
Outside the breeding season, Eurasian chaffinches mainly eat seeds and other plant material that they find on the ground. They often forage in open country in large flocks. Common chaffinches seldom take food directly from plants and only very rarely use their feet for handling food. During the breeding season, their diet switches to invertebrates, especially defoliating caterpillars. They forage in trees and also occasionally make short sallies to catch insects in the air. The young are entirely fed with invertebrates which include caterpillars, aphids, earwigs, spiders and grubs (the larvae of beetles).

==Predators and parasites==
The eggs and nestlings of the Eurasian chaffinch are predated by crows, Eurasian red and eastern grey squirrels, domestic cats and probably also by stoats and weasels. Clutches begun later in the spring suffer less predation, an effect that is believed to be due to the increased vegetation making nests more difficult to find. Unlike the case for the closely related brambling, the common chaffinch is not parasitised by the common cuckoo.

The protozoal parasite &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; was known to infect pigeons and raptors, but beginning in Great Britain in 2005, carcasses of dead European greenfinches and common chaffinches were found to be infected with the parasite. The disease spread and in 2008, infected carcasses were found in Norway, Sweden and Finland and a year later in Germany. The spread of the disease is believed to have been mediated by Eurasian chaffinches, as large numbers of the birds breed in northern Europe and winter in Great Britain. In Great Britain, the number of infected carcasses recovered each year declined after a peak in 2006. There was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches but no significant decline in the overall number of common chaffinches. A similar pattern occurred in Finland where, after the arrival of the disease in 2008, there was a reduction in the number of European greenfinches, but only a small change in the number of Eurasian chaffinches.

Eurasian chaffinches can develop tumors on their feet and legs caused by the &quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot; papillomavirus. The size of the papillomas range from a small nodule on a digit to a large growth involving both the foot and the leg. The disease is uncommon: in a 1973 study undertaken in the Netherlands, of around 25,000 common chaffinches screened, only 330 bore papillomas.

==Status==
The Eurasian chaffinch has an extensive range, estimated at 7 million square kilometres (3.7 million square miles) and a large population including an estimated 130–240 million breeding pairs in Europe. Allowing for the birds breeding in Asia, the total population lies between 530 and 1,400 million individuals. There is no evidence of any serious overall decline in numbers, so the species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.

==Relationship to humans==
The Eurasian chaffinch was once popular as a caged songbird and large numbers of wild birds were trapped and sold. At the end of the 19th century, trapping even depleted the number of birds in London parks. In 1882, the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care of caged birds and included the recommendation: &quot;To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, my advice is, buy him a chaffinch.&quot; Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged common chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number of times. The birds were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem &quot;The Blinded Bird&quot; by the English author Thomas Hardy, which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Great Britain, the practice of keeping Eurasian chaffinches as pets declined after the trapping of wild birds was outlawed by the Wild Birds Protection Acts of 1880 to 1896.

The Eurasian chaffinch is still a popular pet bird in some European countries. In Belgium, the traditional sport of vinkenzetting pits male Eurasian chaffinches against one another in a contest for the most bird calls in an hour.

<doc id="241025" wikidata="Q2915310" url="?curid=241025" title="Shadow of the Hegemon">
<text>Shadow of the Hegemon (2000) is a science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card, the second novel in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot; series (often called the Bean Quartet). It is also the sixth novel in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series. It is told mostly from the point of view of Bean, a largely peripheral character in the original novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; but the central protagonist of the parallel narrative &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow.&quot; &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; was nominated for a Locus Award in 2002.

==Plot summary==

In &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, all of the Battle School graduates, except Ender, return to Earth in 2197 A.D., where Ender&#x27;s brother Peter, using his online pseudonym &quot;Locke&quot;, arranges for Ender to be returned to Earth; but Valentine, under the pseudonym Demosthenes, uses Peter&#x27;s violent past against him to keep Ender exiled. Shortly after their return, the members of the unit Ender commanded (called his Jeesh, an Arabic word meaning &#x27;army&#x27;), with the exception of Bean, are seized as strategists in an upcoming struggle for world dominance, by Achilles de Flandres (ah-SHEEL), who subjects them to solitary confinement. Bean having imprisoned Achilles in the previous novel, Achilles attempts (unsuccessfully) to kill Bean. The Delphikis go into hiding, while Bean joins forces with Sister Carlotta. After he discovers an encoded message sent by Petra confirming that the Russians are Achilles&#x27; backers, he works to free her and the others, while helping Peter come to power.

When Peter publishes under the &#x27;Locke&#x27; pseudonym that Achilles is a murderer, the Battle School graduates are released, excepting Petra, whom Achilles brings to India. From there, he requests plans for an invasion of Burma and then Thailand, for which Indian Battle School graduates, including Sayagi and Virlomi, develop plans for brute-force attacks involving long supply lines. Petra arranges a different plan of stripping India&#x27;s garrisons along the Indo-Pakistani border, which she expects will never happen, until a meeting with Pakistan&#x27;s prime minister, in which Achilles encourages the two nations to make peace among themselves and declare war on other neighbors; secretly giving China the opportunity to annihilate the Indian army.

Petra finds an ally in Virlomi, who reveals to Bean that Petra is a prisoner, and eventually escapes the military compound to bring rescue. Courtesy of Bean&#x27;s and Sister Carlotta&#x27;s assets, &quot;Locke&quot; is nominated publicly for the position of Hegemon, allowing Peter to unmask himself. Meanwhile, Bean enters the Thai military under the patronage of Suriyawong (Suri), a fellow Battle School graduate and (nominal) head of Thailand&#x27;s planning division, and trains 200 Thai soldiers against India. When the Thai Commander-in-Chief betrays Suriyawong and Bean, Bean hides himself and Suri in the barracks of his troops, and sends word for rescue, while Thailand prepares for war. Sister Carlotta&#x27;s airplane, &quot;en route&quot; to Bean&#x27;s location, is destroyed by a Chinese SAM, and Bean receives an earlier-recorded message, in which she describes the relationship between Anton&#x27;s Key and Bean&#x27;s brilliance, but also informs him that his life expectancy will be drastically reduced as a result.

Bean and Suriyawong use the troops Bean has trained to halt Indian supply lines. While striking a bridge, they meet Virlomi, who defects to their side. With the aid of Bean&#x27;s soldiers and Locke&#x27;s distinguished connections, they move on Hyderabad, where Bean rescues Petra. Furthermore, &quot;Locke&quot; publishes an essay detailing the Chinese betrayal just as it is happening, and on the basis of this prescience (and other miracles over the years) Peter Wiggin is elected Hegemon over the world.

==History==
Card accredits two books in particular as being profoundly influential in the writing of this novel: &quot;Thailand: A Short History&quot; by David K. Wyatt and &quot;Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India&quot; by Lawrence James. In addition to these two books he was also inspired by Phillip Absher, who was one of the readers of the first draft. Phillip suggested that the Petra arc of the novel was anticlimactic. Upon hearing this criticism, Card rethought this entire book and decided to split it into two books. At the time of publication, Card thought the Bean series (Shadow series) of the Enderverse would only be four books long.

<text>The up quark or u quark (symbol: u) is the lightest of all quarks, a type of elementary particle, and a significant constituent of matter. It, along with the down quark, forms the neutrons (one up quark, two down quarks) and protons (two up quarks, one down quark) of atomic nuclei. It is part of the first generation of matter, has an electric charge of + &quot;e&quot; and a bare mass of . Like all quarks, the up quark is an elementary fermion with spin , and experiences all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. The antiparticle of the up quark is the up antiquark (sometimes called &quot;antiup quark&quot; or simply &quot;antiup&quot;), which differs from it only in that some of its properties, such as charge have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

Its existence (along with that of the down and strange quarks) was postulated in 1964 by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig to explain the Eightfold Way classification scheme of hadrons. The up quark was first observed by experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968.

== History ==

In the beginnings of particle physics (first half of the 20th century), hadrons such as protons, neutrons and pions were thought to be elementary particles. However, as new hadrons were discovered, the &#x27;particle zoo&#x27; grew from a few particles in the early 1930s and 1940s to several dozens of them in the 1950s. The relationships between each of them were unclear until 1961, when Murray Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne&#x27;eman (independently of each other) proposed a hadron classification scheme called the Eightfold Way, or in more technical terms, SU(3) flavor symmetry.

This classification scheme organized the hadrons into isospin multiplets, but the physical basis behind it was still unclear. In 1964, Gell-Mann and George Zweig (independently of each other) proposed the quark model, then consisting only of up, down, and strange quarks. However, while the quark model explained the Eightfold Way, no direct evidence of the existence of quarks was found until 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Deep inelastic scattering experiments indicated that protons had substructure, and that protons made of three more-fundamental particles explained the data (thus confirming the quark model).

At first people were reluctant to describe the three bodies as quarks, instead preferring Richard Feynman&#x27;s parton description, but over time the quark theory became accepted (see &quot;November Revolution&quot;).

== Mass ==
Despite being extremely common, the bare mass of the up quark is not well determined, but probably lies between 1.8 and . Lattice QCD calculations give a more precise value: .

When found in mesons (particles made of one quark and one antiquark) or baryons (particles made of three quarks), the &#x27;effective mass&#x27; (or &#x27;dressed&#x27; mass) of quarks becomes greater because of the binding energy caused by the gluon field between each quark (see mass–energy equivalence). The bare mass of up quarks is so light, it cannot be straightforwardly calculated because relativistic effects have to be taken into account.

<text>The down quark (symbol: d) is a type of elementary particle, and a major constituent of matter. The down quark is the second-lightest of all quarks, and combines with other quarks to form composite particles called hadrons. Down quarks are most commonly found in atomic nuclei, where it combines with up quarks to form protons and neutrons. The proton is made of one down quark with two up quarks, and the neutron is made up of two down quarks with one up quark. Because they are found in every single known atom, down quarks are present in all everyday matter that we interact with.

<text>The charm quark, charmed quark, or c quark is an elementary particle found in composite subatomic particles called hadrons such as the J/psi meson and the charmed baryons created in particle accelerator collisions. Several bosons, including the W and Z bosons and the Higgs boson, can decay into charm quarks. All charm quarks carry charm, a quantum number. This second-generation particle is the third-most-massive quark, with a mass of as measured in 2022, and a charge of + &quot;e&quot;.

The existence of the charm quark was first predicted by James Bjorken and Sheldon Glashow in 1964, and in 1970, Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani showed how its existence would account for experimental and theoretical discrepancies. In 1974, its existence was confirmed through the independent discoveries of the J/psi meson at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. In the next few years, several other charmed particles, including the D meson and the charmed strange mesons, were found.

In the 21st century, a baryon containing two charm quarks has been found. There is recent evidence that intrinsic charm quarks exist in the proton, and the coupling of the charm quark and the Higgs boson has been studied. Recent evidence also indicates CP violation in the decay of the D0 meson, which contains the charm quark.

== Naming ==
According to Sheldon Glashow, the charm quark received its name because of the &quot;symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world&quot;. Glashow also justified the name as &quot;a magical device to avert evil&quot;, because adding the charm quark would prohibit unwanted and unseen decays in the three-quark theory at the time. The charm quark is also called the &quot;charmed quark&quot; in both academic and non-academic contexts. The symbol of the charm quark is &quot;c&quot;.

== History ==
=== Background ===

In 1961, Murray Gell-Mann introduced the Eightfold Way as a pattern to group baryons and mesons. In 1964, Gell-Mann and George Zweig independently proposed that all hadrons are composed of elementary constituents, which Gell-Mann called &quot;quarks&quot;. Initially, only the up quark, the down quark, and the strange quark were proposed. These quarks would produce all of the particles in the Eightfold Way. Gell-Mann and Kazuhiko Nishijima had established strangeness, a quantum number, in 1953 to describe processes involving strange particles such as and .

=== Theoretical prediction ===

In 1964, James Bjorken and Sheldon Glashow theorized &quot;charm&quot; as a new quantum number. At the time, there were four known leptons—the electron, the muon, and each of their neutrinos—but Gell-Mann initially proposed only three quarks. Bjorken and Glashow thus hoped to establish parallels between the leptons and the quarks with their theory. According to Glashow, the conjecture came from &quot;aesthetic arguments&quot;.

In 1970, Glashow, John Iliopoulos, and Luciano Maiani proposed a new quark that differed from the three then-known quarks by the charm quantum number. They further predicted the existence of &quot;charmed particles&quot; and offered suggestions on how to experimentally produce them. They also suggested the charmed quark could provide a mechanism—the GIM mechanism—to facilitate the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces.

At the Conference on Experimental Meson Spectroscopy (EMS) in April 1974, Glashow delivered his paper titled &quot;Charm: An Invention Awaits Discovery&quot;. Glashow asserted because neutral currents were likely to exist, a fourth quark was &quot;sorely needed&quot; to explain the rarity of the decays of certain kaons. He also made several predictions on the properties of charm quarks. He wagered that, by the next EMS conference in 1976:
In July 1974, at the 17th International Conference on High Energy Physics (ICHEP), Iliopoulos said:
Applying an argument of naturalness to the kaon mass splitting between the K and K states, the mass of the charm quark was estimated by Mary K. Gaillard and Benjamin W. Lee in 1974 to be less than .

=== Discovery ===
Glashow predicted that the down quark of a proton could absorb a and become a charm quark. Then, the proton would be transformed into a charmed baryon before it decayed into several particles, including a lambda baryon. In late May 1974, Robert Palmer and Nicholas P. Samios found an event generating a lambda baryon from their bubble chamber at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It took months for Palmer to be convinced the lambda baryon came from a charmed particle. When the magnet of the bubble chamber failed in October 1974, they did not encounter the same event. The two scientists published their observations in early 1975. Michael Riordan commented that this event was &quot;ambiguous&quot; and &quot;encouraging but not convincing evidence&quot;.

==== J/psi meson (1974) ====
In 1974, Samuel C. C. Ting was searching for charmed particles at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). His team was using an electron-pair detector. By the end of August, they found a peak at and the signal&#x27;s width was less than . The team was eventually convinced they had observed a massive particle and named it &quot;J&quot;. Ting considered announcing his discovery in October 1974, but postponed the announcement due to his concern about the μ/π ratio.

At the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), Burton Richter&#x27;s team performed experiments on 9–10 November 1974. They also found a high probability of interaction at . They called the particle &quot;psi&quot;. On 11 November 1974, Richter met Ting at the SLAC, and they announced their discovery.

Theorists immediately began to analyze the new particle. It was shown to have a lifetime on the scale of 10−20 seconds, suggesting special characteristics. Thomas Appelquist and David Politzer suggested that the particle was composed of a charm quark and a charm antiquark whose spins were aligned in parallel. The two called this configuration &quot;charmonium&quot;. Charmonium would have two forms: &quot;orthocharmonium&quot;, where the spins of the two quarks are parallel, and &quot;paracharmonium&quot;, where the spins align oppositely. Murray Gell-Mann also believed in the idea of charmonium. Some other theorists, such as Richard Feynman, initially thought the new particle consisted of an up quark with a charm antiquark.

On 15 November 1974, Ting and Richter issued a press release about their discovery. On 21 November at the SLAC, SPEAR found a resonance of the J/psi particle at as Martin Breidenbach and Terence Goldman had predicted. This particle was called ψ′ (&quot;psi-prime&quot;). In late November, Appelquist and Politzer published their paper theorizing charmonium. Glashow and Alvaro De Rujula also published a paper called &quot;Is Bound Charm Found?&quot;, in which they used the charm quark and asymptotic freedom to explain the properties of the J/psi meson.

Eventually, on 2 December 1974, &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; (PRL) published the discovery papers of J and psi, by Ting and Richter respectively. The discovery of the psi-prime was published the following week. Then, on 6 January 1975, &quot;PRL&quot; published nine theoretical papers on the J/psi particle; according to Michael Riordan, five of them &quot;promoted the charm hypothesis and its variations&quot;. In 1976, Ting and Richter shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery &quot;of a heavy elementary particle of the new kind&quot;.

In August 1976, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Glashow recalled his wager and commented, &quot;John [Iliopoulos]&#x27;s wine and my hat had been saved in the nick of time&quot;. At the next EMS conference, spectroscopists ate Mexican candy hats supplied by the organizers. Frank Close wrote a &quot;Nature&quot; article titled &quot;Iliopoulos won his bet&quot; in the same year, saying the 18th ICHEP was &quot;indeed dominated by that very discovery&quot;. No-one paid off their bets to Iliopoulos.

==== Other charmed particles (1975–1977) ====
In April 1975, E. G. Cazzoli et al., including Palmer and Samios, published their earlier ambiguous evidence for the charmed baryon. By the time of the Lepton–Photon Symposium in August 1975, eight new heavy particles had been discovered. These particles, however, have zero total charm. Starting from the fourth quarter of that year, physicists began to look for particles with a net, or &quot;naked&quot;, charm.

On 3 May 1976 at SLAC, Gerson Goldhaber and François Pierre identified a peak, which suggested the presence of a neutral charmed D meson according to Glashow&#x27;s prediction. On 5 May, Goldhaber and Pierre published a joint memorandum about their discovery of the &quot;naked charm&quot;. By the time of the 18th International Conference on High Energy Physics, more charmed particles had been discovered. Riordan said &quot;solid evidence for charm surfaced in session after session&quot; at the conference, confirming the existence of the charm quark. The charmed strange meson was discovered in 1977.

=== Later and current research ===
In 2002, the SELEX Collaboration at Fermilab published the first observation of the doubly charmed baryon (&quot;double charmed xi+&quot;). It is a three-quark particle containing two charm quarks. The team found doubly charmed baryons with an up quark are more massive and have a higher rate of production than those with a down quark.

In 2007, the BaBar and Belle collaborations each reported evidence for the mixing of two neutral charmed mesons, and. The evidence confirmed the mixing rate is small, as is predicted by the standard model. Neither studies found evidence for CP violation between the decays of the two charmed particles.

In 2022, the NNPDF Collaboration found evidence for the existence of intrinsic charm quarks in the proton. In the same year, physicists also conducted a direct search for Higgs boson decays into charm quarks using the ATLAS detector of the Large Hadron Collider. They have determined that the Higgs–charm coupling is weaker than the Higgs–bottom coupling. On 7 July 2022, the LHCb experiment announced they had found evidence of direct CP violation in the decay of the D0 meson into pions.

== Characteristics ==
The charm quark is a second-generation up-type quark. It carries charm, a quantum number. According to the 2022 &quot;Particle Physics Review&quot;, the charmed quark has a mass of , a charge of + &quot;e&quot;, and a charm of +1. The charm quark is more massive than the strange quark: the ratio between the masses of the two is about .

The CKM matrix describes the weak interaction of quarks. As of 2022, the values of the CKM matrix relating to the charm quark are:
formula_1

Charm quarks can exist in either &quot;open charm particles&quot;, which contain one or several charm quarks, or as charmonium states, which are bound states of a charm quark and a charm antiquark. There are several charmed mesons, including and . Charmed baryons include , , , , with various charges and resonances.

=== Production and decay ===
Particles containing charm quarks can be produced via electron–positron collisions or in hadron collisions. Using different energies, electron–positron colliders can produce psi or upsilon mesons. Hadron colliders produce particles that contain charm quarks at a higher cross section. The W boson can also decay into hadrons containing the charm quark or the charm antiquark. The Z boson can decay into charmonium through charm quark fragmentation. The Higgs boson can also decay to or through the same mechanism. The decay rate of the Higgs boson into charmonium is &quot;governed by the charm-quark Yukawa coupling&quot;.

The charm quark can decay into other quarks via weak decays. The charm quark also annihilates with the charm antiquark during the decays of ground-state charmonium mesons.

<doc id="241029" wikidata="Q6778" url="?curid=241029" title="Top quark">
<text>The top quark, sometimes also referred to as the truth quark, (symbol: t) is the most massive of all observed elementary particles. It derives its mass from its coupling to the Higgs field. This coupling is very close to unity; in the Standard Model of particle physics, it is the largest (strongest) coupling at the scale of the weak interactions and above. The top quark was discovered in 1995 by the CDF and DØ experiments at Fermilab.

Like all other quarks, the top quark is a fermion with spin-1/2 and participates in all four fundamental interactions: gravitation, electromagnetism, weak interactions, and strong interactions. It has an electric charge of + &quot;e&quot;. It has a mass of , which is close to the rhenium atom mass. The antiparticle of the top quark is the top antiquark (symbol: , sometimes called &quot;antitop quark&quot; or simply &quot;antitop&quot;), which differs from it only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

The top quark interacts with gluons of the strong interaction and is typically produced in hadron colliders via this interaction. However, once produced, the top (or antitop) can decay only through the weak force. It decays to a W boson and either a bottom quark (most frequently), a strange quark, or, on the rarest of occasions, a down quark.

The Standard Model determines the top quark&#x27;s mean lifetime to be roughly . This is about a twentieth of the timescale for strong interactions, and therefore it does not form hadrons, giving physicists a unique opportunity to study a &quot;bare&quot; quark (all other quarks hadronize, meaning that they combine with other quarks to form hadrons and can only be observed as such).

Because the top quark is so massive, its properties allowed indirect determination of the mass of the Higgs boson (see &quot;&quot; below). As such, the top quark&#x27;s properties are extensively studied as a means to discriminate between competing theories of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The top quark is the only quark that has been directly observed due to its decay time being shorter than the hadronization time.

== History ==
In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa predicted the existence of a third generation of quarks to explain observed CP violations in kaon decay. The names top and bottom were introduced by Haim Harari in 1975, to match the names of the first generation of quarks (up and down) reflecting the fact that the two were the &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; component of a weak isospin doublet.

The proposal of Kobayashi and Maskawa heavily relied on the GIM mechanism put forward by Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani, which predicted the existence of the then still unobserved charm quark. (Direct evidence for the existence of quarks, including the other second generation quark, the strange quark, was obtained in 1968; strange particles were discovered back in 1947.) When in November 1974 teams at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) simultaneously announced the discovery of the J/ψ meson, it was soon after identified as a bound state of the missing charm quark with its antiquark. This discovery allowed the GIM mechanism to become part of the Standard Model. With the acceptance of the GIM mechanism, Kobayashi and Maskawa&#x27;s prediction also gained in credibility. Their case was further strengthened by the discovery of the tau by Martin Lewis Perl&#x27;s team at SLAC between 1974 and 1978. The tau announced a third generation of leptons, breaking the new symmetry between leptons and quarks introduced by the GIM mechanism. Restoration of the symmetry implied the existence of a fifth and sixth quark.

It was in fact not long until a fifth quark, the bottom, was discovered by the E288 experiment team, led by Leon Lederman at Fermilab in 1977. This strongly suggested that there must also be a sixth quark, the top, to complete the pair. It was known that this quark would be heavier than the bottom, requiring more energy to create in particle collisions, but the general expectation was that the sixth quark would soon be found. However, it took another 18 years before the existence of the top was confirmed.

Early searches for the top quark at SLAC and DESY (in Hamburg) came up empty-handed. When, in the early 1980s, the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN discovered the W boson and the Z boson, it was again felt that the discovery of the top was imminent. As the SPS gained competition from the Tevatron at Fermilab there was still no sign of the missing particle, and it was announced by the group at CERN that the top mass must be at least . After a race between CERN and Fermilab to discover the top, the accelerator at CERN reached its limits without creating a single top, pushing the lower bound on its mass up to .

The Tevatron was (until the start of LHC operation at CERN in 2009) the only hadron collider powerful enough to produce top quarks. In order to be able to confirm a future discovery, a second detector, the DØ detector, was added to the complex (in addition to the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) already present). In October 1992, the two groups found their first hint of the top, with a single creation event that appeared to contain the top. In the following years, more evidence was collected and on 22 April 1994, the CDF group submitted their article presenting tentative evidence for the existence of a top quark with a mass of about . In the meantime, DØ had found no more evidence than the suggestive event in 1992. A year later, on 2 March 1995, after having gathered more evidence and reanalyzed the DØ data (which had been searched for a much lighter top), the two groups jointly reported the discovery of the top at a mass of .

In the years leading up to the top-quark discovery, it was realized that certain precision measurements of the electroweak vector boson masses and couplings are very sensitive to the value of the top-quark mass. These effects become much larger for higher values of the top mass and therefore could indirectly see the top quark even if it could not be directly detected in any experiment at the time. The largest effect from the top-quark mass was on the T parameter, and by 1994 the precision of these indirect measurements had led to a prediction of the top-quark mass to be between and . It is the development of techniques that ultimately allowed such precision calculations that led to Gerardus &#x27;t Hooft and Martinus Veltman winning the Nobel Prize in physics in 1999.

== Properties ==
* At the final Tevatron energy of 1.96 TeV, top–antitop pairs were produced with a cross section of about 7 picobarns (pb). The Standard Model prediction (at next-to-leading order with = ) is 6.7–7.5 pb.
* The W bosons from top quark decays carry polarization from the parent particle, hence pose themselves as a unique probe to top polarization.
* In the Standard Model, the top quark is predicted to have a spin quantum number of and electric charge . A first measurement of the top quark charge has been published, resulting in some confidence that the top quark charge is indeed .

== Production ==
Because top quarks are very massive, large amounts of energy are needed to create one. The only way to achieve such high energies is through high-energy collisions. These occur naturally in the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere as cosmic rays collide with particles in the air, or can be created in a particle accelerator. In 2011, after the Tevatron ceased operations, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN became the only accelerator that generates a beam of sufficient energy to produce top quarks, with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. There are multiple processes that can lead to the production of top quarks, but they can be conceptually divided in two categories: top-pair production, and single-top production.

=== Top-quark pairs ===

The most common is production of a top–antitop pair via strong interactions. In a collision, a highly energetic gluon is created, which subsequently decays into a top and antitop. This process was responsible for the majority of the top events at Tevatron and was the process observed when the top was first discovered in 1995. It is also possible to produce pairs of top–antitop through the decay of an intermediate photon or Z-boson. However, these processes are predicted to be much rarer and have a virtually identical experimental signature in a hadron collider like Tevatron.

=== Single top quarks ===
The production of single top quarks via weak interaction is a distinctly different process. This can happen in several ways (called channels): Either an intermediate W-boson decays into a top and antibottom quarks (&quot;s-channel&quot;) or a bottom quark (probably created in a pair through the decay of a gluon) transforms to a top quark by exchanging a W boson with an up or down quark (&quot;t-channel&quot;). A single top quark can also be produced in association with a W boson, requiring an initial-state bottom quark (&quot;tW-channel&quot;). The first evidence for these processes was published by the DØ collaboration in December 2006, and in March 2009 the CDF and DØ collaborations released twin articles with the definitive observation of these processes. The main significance of measuring these production processes is that their frequency is directly proportional to the  component of the CKM matrix.

== Decay ==

The only known way the top quark can decay is through the weak interaction, producing a W boson and a bottom quark.
Because of its enormous mass, the top quark is extremely short-lived, with a predicted lifetime of only . As a result, top quarks do not have time before they decay to form hadrons as other quarks do.
The absence of a hadron surrounding the top quark provides physicists with the unique opportunity to study the behavior of a &quot;bare&quot; quark.

In particular, it is possible to directly determine the branching ratio:

formula_1

The best current determination of this ratio is . Since this ratio is equal to according to the Standard Model, this gives another way of determining the CKM element , or in combination with the determination of from single top production provides tests for the assumption that the CKM matrix is unitary.

The Standard Model also allows more exotic decays, but only at one loop level, meaning that they are extremely rare. In particular, it is conceivable that a top quark might decay into another up-type quark (an up or a charm) by emitting a photon or a Z-boson. However, searches for these exotic decay modes have produced no evidence that they occur, in accordance with expectations of the Standard Model. The branching ratios for these decays have been determined to be less than 1.8 in 10000 for photonic decay and less than 5 in 10000 for Z boson decay at 95% confidence.

== Mass and coupling to the Higgs boson ==
The Standard Model generates fermion masses through their couplings to the Higgs boson. This Higgs boson acts as a field that fills space. Fermions interact with this field in proportion to their individual coupling constants , which generates mass. A low-mass particle, such as the electron has a minuscule coupling , while the top quark has the largest coupling to the Higgs, .

In the Standard Model, all of the quark and lepton Higgs–Yukawa couplings are small compared to the top-quark Yukawa coupling. This hierarchy in the fermion masses remains a profound and open problem in theoretical physics. Higgs–Yukawa couplings are not fixed constants of nature, as their values vary slowly as the energy scale (distance scale) at which they are measured. These dynamics of Higgs–Yukawa couplings, called &quot;running coupling constants&quot;, are due to a quantum effect called the renormalization group.

The Higgs–Yukawa couplings of the up, down, charm, strange and bottom quarks are hypothesized to have small values at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, . They increase in value at lower energy scales, at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs. The slight growth is due to corrections from the QCD coupling. The corrections from the Yukawa couplings are negligible for the lower-mass quarks.

One of the prevailing views in particle physics is that the size of the top-quark Higgs–Yukawa coupling is determined by a unique nonlinear property of the renormalization group equation that describes the &quot;running&quot; of the large Higgs–Yukawa coupling of the top quark. If a quark Higgs–Yukawa coupling has a large value at very high energies, its Yukawa corrections will evolve downward in mass scale and cancel against the QCD corrections. This is known as a (quasi-) infrared fixed point, which was first predicted by B. Pendleton and G.G. Ross, and by Christopher T. Hill, No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if sufficiently large, it will reach this fixed-point value. The corresponding quark mass is then predicted.

The top-quark Yukawa coupling lies very near the infrared fixed point of the Standard Model. The renormalization group equation is:

formula_2

where is the color gauge coupling, is the weak isospin gauge coupling, and is the weak hypercharge gauge coupling. This equation describes how the Yukawa coupling changes with energy scale . Solutions to this equation for large initial values cause the right-hand side of the equation to quickly approach zero, locking to the QCD coupling .

The value of the top quark fixed point is fairly precisely determined in the Standard Model, leading to a top-quark mass of 220 GeV. This is about 25% larger than the observed top mass and may be hinting at new physics at higher energy scales.

The quasi-infrared fixed point subsequently became the basis of top quark condensation and topcolor theories of electroweak symmetry breaking, in which the Higgs boson is composed of a pair of top and antitop quarks. The predicted top-quark mass comes into improved agreement with the fixed point if there are additional Higgs scalars beyond the standard model and therefore it may be hinting at a rich spectroscopy of new Higgs fields at energy scales that can be probed with the LHC and its upgrades.

<doc id="241030" wikidata="Q6786" url="?curid=241030" title="Bottom quark">
<text>The bottom quark, beauty quark, or b quark, is an elementary particle of the third generation. It is a heavy quark with a charge of − &quot;e&quot;.

All quarks are described in a similar way by electroweak interaction and quantum chromodynamics, but the bottom quark has exceptionally low rates of transition to lower-mass quarks. The bottom quark is also notable because it is a product in almost all top quark decays, and is a frequent decay product of the Higgs boson.

== Name and history ==
The bottom quark was first described theoretically in 1973 by physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa to explain CP violation. The name &quot;bottom&quot; was introduced in 1975 by Haim Harari.

The evidence for the bottom quark was first obtained in 1977 by the Fermilab E288 experiment team led by Leon M. Lederman, when proton-nucleon collisions produced bottomonium decaying to pairs of muons. The discovery was confirmed about a year later by the PLUTO and DASP2 Collaborations at the electron-positron collider DORIS at DESY. It was reported at the time that DESY scientists were in favor of the name &quot;beauty&quot;, while the American scientists tended towards &quot;bottom&quot;.

Kobayashi and Maskawa won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for their explanation of CP-violation.

While the name &quot;beauty&quot; is sometimes used, &quot;bottom&quot; became the predominant usage by analogy of &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; to &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;.

== Distinct character ==
The bottom quark&#x27;s &quot;bare&quot; mass is around – a bit more than four times the mass of a proton, and many orders of magnitude larger than common &quot;light&quot; quarks.

Although it almost exclusively transitions from or to a top quark, the bottom quark can decay into either an up quark or charm quark via the weak interaction. CKM matrix elements and specify the rates, where both these decays are suppressed, making lifetimes of most bottom particles (~10−12 s) somewhat longer than those of charmed particles (~10−13 s), but shorter than those of strange particles (from ~10−10 to ~10−8 s).

The combination of high mass and low transition rate gives experimental collision byproducts containing a bottom quark a distinctive signature that makes them relatively easy to identify using a technique called &quot;B-tagging&quot;. For that reason, mesons containing the bottom quark are exceptionally long-lived for their mass, and are the easiest particles to use to investigate CP violation. Such experiments are being performed at the BaBar, Belle and LHCb experiments.

== Hadrons containing bottom quarks ==

Some of the hadrons containing bottom quarks include:
* B mesons contain a bottom quark (or its antiparticle) and an up or down quark.
* and mesons contain a bottom quark along with a charm quark or strange quark respectively.
* There are many bottomonium states, for example the meson and χb(3P), the first particle discovered in LHC. These consist of a bottom quark and its antiparticle.
* Bottom baryons have been observed, and are named in analogy with strange baryons (e.g. ).

<text>The muon neutrino is an elementary particle which has the symbol and zero electric charge. Together with the muon it forms the second generation of leptons, hence the name muon neutrino. It was discovered in 1962 by Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger. The discovery was rewarded with the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics.

==Discovery==
The muon neutrino or &quot;neutretto&quot; was hypothesized to exist by a number of physicists in the 1940s. The first paper on it may be Shoichi Sakata and Takesi Inoue&#x27;s two-meson theory of 1942, which also involved two neutrinos.
In 1962 Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinberger proved the existence of the muon neutrino in an experiment at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. This earned them the 1988 Nobel Prize.

==Speed==

In September 2011 OPERA researchers reported that muon neutrinos were apparently traveling at faster than light speed. This result was confirmed again in a second experiment in November 2011. These results were viewed skeptically by the scientific community at large, and more experiments investigated the phenomenon. In March 2012 the ICARUS team published results directly contradicting the results of OPERA.

Later, in July 2012, the apparent anomalous super-luminous propagation of neutrinos was traced to a faulty element of the fibre optic timing system in Gran-Sasso. After it was corrected the neutrinos appeared to travel with the speed of light within the errors of the experiment.

<text>The electron neutrino () is an elementary particle which has zero electric charge and a spin of . Together with the electron, it forms the first generation of leptons, hence the name &quot;electron neutrino&quot;. It was first hypothesized by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, to account for missing momentum and missing energy in beta decay, and was discovered in 1956 by a team led by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines (see Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment).

== Proposal ==
In the early 1900s, theories predicted that the electrons resulting from beta decay should have been emitted at a specific energy. However, in 1914, James Chadwick showed that electrons were instead emitted in a continuous spectrum.
: 

In 1930, Wolfgang Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the observed difference between the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the initial and final particles.
: 

=== Pauli&#x27;s letter ===
On 4 December 1930, Pauli wrote a letter to the Physical Institute of the Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich, in which he proposed the electron &quot;neutron&quot; [neutrino] as a potential solution to solve the problem of the continuous beta decay spectrum. A translated excerpt of his letter reads:
Dear radioactive ladies and gentlemen,

As the bearer of these lines [...] will explain more exactly, considering the &#x27;false&#x27; statistics of N-14 and Li-6 nuclei, as well as the continuous &quot;β&quot;-spectrum, I have hit upon a desperate remedy to save the &quot;exchange theorem&quot; of statistics and the energy theorem. Namely [there is] the possibility that there could exist in the nuclei electrically neutral particles that I wish to call neutrons, which have spin  and obey the exclusion principle, and additionally differ from light quanta in that they do not travel with the velocity of light: The mass of the neutron must be of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass and, in any case, not larger than 0.01 proton mass. The continuous &quot;β&quot;-spectrum would then become understandable by the assumption that in &quot;β&quot; decay a neutron is emitted together with the electron, in such a way that the sum of the energies of neutron and electron is constant.

But I don&#x27;t feel secure enough to publish anything about this idea, so I first turn confidently to you, dear radioactives, with a question as to the situation concerning experimental proof of such a neutron, if it has something like about 10 times the penetrating capacity of a &quot;γ&quot; ray.

I admit that my remedy may appear to have a small &quot;a priori&quot; probability because neutrons, if they exist, would probably have long ago been seen. However, only those who wager can win, and the seriousness of the situation of the continuous &quot;β&quot;-spectrum can be made clear by the saying of my honored predecessor in office, Mr. Debye, [...] &quot;&quot;One does best not to think about that at all, like the new taxes&quot;.&quot; [...] So, dear radioactives, put it to test and set it right. [...]

: With many greetings to you, also to Mr. Back,
: Your devoted servant,

: W. Pauli

A translated reprint of the full letter can be found in the September 1978 issue of &quot;Physics Today&quot;.

== Discovery ==
The electron neutrino was discovered by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956.

== Name ==
Pauli originally named his proposed light particle a &quot;neutron&quot;. When James Chadwick discovered a much more massive nuclear particle in 1932 and also named it a neutron, this left the two particles with the same name. Enrico Fermi, who developed the theory of beta decay, introduced the term &quot;neutrino&quot; in 1934 (it was jokingly coined by Edoardo Amaldi during a conversation with Fermi at the Institute of physics of via Panisperna in Rome, in order to distinguish this light neutral particle from Chadwick&#x27;s neutron) to resolve the confusion. It was a pun on , the Italian equivalent of &quot;neutron&quot;: the &quot;-one&quot; ending can be an augmentative in Italian, so &quot;neutrone&quot; could be read as the &quot;large neutral thing&quot;; &quot;-ino&quot; replaces the augmentative suffix with a diminutive one (&quot;small neutral thing&quot;).

Upon the prediction and discovery of a second neutrino, it became important to distinguish between different types of neutrinos. Pauli&#x27;s neutrino is now identified as the &quot;electron neutrino&quot;, while the second neutrino is identified as the &quot;muon neutrino&quot;.

== Electron antineutrino ==
The electron neutrino has a corresponding antiparticle, the electron antineutrino (), which differs only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. One major open question in particle physics is whether neutrinos and anti-neutrinos are the same particle. If so, they would be Majorana fermions, whereas if not, they would be Dirac fermions. They are produced in beta decay and other types of weak interactions.

<text>Medb (), later spelled Meadhbh (), Méabh(a) () and Méibh (), and often anglicised as Maeve ( ), is queen of Connacht in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. Her husband in the core stories of the cycle is Ailill mac Máta, although she had several husbands before him who were also kings of Connacht. She rules from Cruachan (now Rathcroghan, County Roscommon). She is the enemy (and former wife) of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and is best known for starting the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (&quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;) to steal Ulster&#x27;s prize stud bull Donn Cúailnge.

Medb is strong-willed, ambitious, cunning and promiscuous, and is an archetypal warrior queen. She is believed by some to be a manifestation of the sovereignty goddess. Medb of Connacht is probably identical with Medb Lethderg, the sovereignty goddess of Tara.

==Name==
In Old Irish her name is ; in Middle Irish, ; in Early Modern Irish, or ; and in modern Irish &quot;Méabh&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) or &quot;Méibh&quot;. This is generally believed to come from the Proto-Celtic &quot;*medu-&quot; (&quot;mead&quot;) or &quot;*medua&quot; (&quot;intoxicating&quot;), and the meaning of her name has thus been interpreted as &quot;mead-woman&quot; or &quot;she who intoxicates&quot;. This is thought to reflect her role as sovereignty goddess. In ancient and medieval Ireland, the drinking of mead was a key part of a king&#x27;s inauguration ceremony. In myth, a supernatural woman representing the sovereignty of the land chooses a king by offering him an alcoholic drink, thus bestowing sovereignty upon him. However, it is also suggested that the name comes from Proto-Celtic &quot;&quot; (&quot;the ruler&quot;).

The name has been Anglicised as Maeve, Maev, Mave or Maiv. There are several place names in Ireland containing the name Medb. According to Kay Muhr of the Ulster Place-Name Society, some of these names suggest Medb was also an earth and fertility goddess. They include Ballypitmave (&quot;Baile Phite Méabha&quot;, &quot;townland of Medb&#x27;s vulva&quot;) in County Antrim and Sawel Pitmave (&quot;Samhail Phite Méabha&quot;, &quot;likeness to Medb&#x27;s vulva&quot;) in County Tyrone, both in northern Ulster. Other placenames include Maeve&#x27;s Cairn in County Sligo, Barnavave (&quot;Bearna Mhéabha&quot;, &quot;Medb&#x27;s gap&quot;) in County Louth, Boveva (&quot;Boith Mhéabha&quot;, &quot;Medb&#x27;s huts&quot;) in County Londonderry, Knockmaa (&quot;Cnoc Meá&quot;, &quot;Medb&#x27;s hill&quot;) in County Galway, Meskanmave (&quot;Meascán Mhéabha&quot;, &quot;Medb&#x27;s lump&quot;) in County Donegal, Milleen Meva (&quot;Millín Mhéabha&quot;, &quot;Medb&#x27;s knoll&quot;) at Rathcroghan in County Roscommon, and Rath Meave at Tara in County Meath.

==Description==
Medb is described as a fair haired wolf queen, whose form was so beautiful that it robbed men of two-thirds of their valor upon seeing her.

==Marriages and rise to power==
How Medb came to power in Connacht and married Ailill mac Máta is told in the tale &quot;Cath Bóinde&quot; (&quot;The Battle of the Boyne&quot;), also known as &quot;Ferchuitred Medba&quot; (&quot;Medb&#x27;s man-share&quot;). Her father, Eochaid Feidlech, the High King of Ireland, married her to Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, because he had killed Conchobar&#x27;s purported father, the former High King Fachtna Fáthach, in battle. They had a son, Glaisne, but the marriage was a bad one and she left him. Eochaid gave Conchobar another of his daughters, Eithne (or Clothru), but Medb murdered her while she was pregnant; her son Furbaide was born by posthumous caesarian section.

Eochaid deposed the then-king of Connacht, Tinni mac Conri, and installed Medb in his place. However, Tinni regained a share of the throne when he and Medb later became lovers. Conchobar raped Medb after an assembly at Tara, and war ensued between the High King and Ulster. Tinni challenged Conchobar to single combat, and lost. Eochaid Dála of the Fir Domnann, who had been Tinni&#x27;s rival for the kingship, protected the Connacht army as it retreated, and became Medb&#x27;s next husband and king of Connacht. Medb demanded her husband satisfy her three criteria—that he be without fear, meanness, or jealousy. The last was particularly important, as she had many lovers. While married to Eochaid Dála, she took Ailill mac Máta, chief of her bodyguard, as her lover. Eochaid discovered the affair, challenged Ailill to single combat, and lost. Ailill then married Medb and became king of Connacht.

==Medb&#x27;s 7 Sons==
Medb and Ailill had seven sons, all called Maine. They originally all had other names, but when Medb asked a druid which of her sons would kill Conchobar, he replied, &quot;Maine&quot;. She did not have a son called Maine, so she renamed all her sons as follows:

* Fedlimid became Maine Athramail (&quot;like his father&quot;)
* Cairbre became Maine Máthramail (&quot;like his mother&quot;)
* Eochaid became Maine Andoe (&quot;the swift&quot;) and was also known as Cich-Maine Andoe or Cichmuine
* Fergus became Maine Taí (&quot;the silent&quot;)
* Cet became Maine Mórgor (&quot;of great duty&quot;)
* Sin became Maine Mílscothach (&quot;honey-speech&quot;)
* Dáire became Maine Móepirt (&quot;beyond description&quot;)

The prophecy was fulfilled when Maine Andoe went on to kill Conchobar, son of Arthur, son of Bruide – not Conchobar, son of Fachtna
Fathach, as Medb had assumed the druid meant.

==Medb&#x27;s Two Daughters==
Medb and Ailill also had a daughter Findabair and another daughter called Cainnear or &quot;Cainnear Dearg&quot; (Red Cainnear) who was killed violently with a spear in the Tain Bo Flidais.

==Cattle Raid of Cooley==

Medb insisted that she be equal in wealth with her husband, and started the Cattle Raid of Cooley when she discovered that Ailill was one powerful stud bull richer than her. She discovered that the only rival to Ailill&#x27;s bull, Finnbennach, was Donn Cúailnge, owned by Dáire mac Fiachna, a vassal of Conchobar&#x27;s. She sent messengers to Dáire, offering wealth, land and sexual favours in return for the loan of the bull, and Dáire initially agreed. But when a drunken messenger declared that, if he had not agreed, the bull would have been taken by force, Dáire withdrew his consent, and Medb prepared for war.

An army was raised including contingents from all over Ireland. One was a group of Ulster exiles led by Conchobar&#x27;s estranged son Cormac Cond Longas and his foster-father Fergus mac Róich, former king of Ulster and one of Medb&#x27;s lovers. It is reported that it took thirty men to satisfy her, or Fergus once. Medb&#x27;s relationship with Fergus is alluded to in the early poem &quot;Conailla Medb míchuru&quot; (&quot;Medb has entered evil contracts&quot;) by Luccreth moccu Chiara (c. 600); it asserts that Medb wrongly seduced Fergus into turning against Ulster &quot;because he preferred the buttocks of a woman to his own people&quot;.

Because of a divine curse on the Ulstermen, the invasion was opposed only by the teenage Ulster hero Cúchulainn, who held up the army&#x27;s advance by demanding single combat at fords. Medb and Ailill offered their daughter Findabair in marriage to a series of heroes as payment for fighting Cúchulainn, but all were defeated. Nevertheless, Medb secured the bull. However, after a final battle against Conchobar&#x27;s assembled army, she was forced to retreat. Donn Cúailnge was brought back to Cruachan, where it fought Ailill&#x27;s bull, Finnbennach, killing him, but dying of his wounds.

Also, throughout the Táin Bó Cúailnge Medb has several encounters with Cúchulainn in which he kills either her pets or handmaidens and the place in which they were killed is then named after them, which illustrates the importance of landscape throughout the text of the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Examples of this occur when Cúchulainn &quot;slung a stone and killed a pet stoat as it sat on Medb&#x27;s shoulder by her neck, south of the ford. Hence the name Meithe Togmaill, Stoat Neck&quot; and when he kills Medb&#x27;s handmaid: &quot;He slung a stone at her from the heights of Cuincu and killed her on the flat place that bears her name, Reid Locha, Locha&#x27;s Level, in Cualinge&quot;. Medb&#x27;s behaviour further illustrates the importance of the landscape when she goes to great lengths to permanently alter it to show her contempt for Ulster. &quot;She preferred to cross the mountain by leaving a track that would show forever her contempt for Ulster… to make the Pass of the Cualinge Cattle&quot;.

==Later years==
Out of jealousy for his affair with Medb, Ailill had Fergus killed. In his old age, after Conchobar&#x27;s death, the Ulster hero Conall Cernach came to stay with Ailill and Medb, as they were the only household capable of supporting him. Medb tasked him to keep an eye on Ailill, who was seeing other women. Finding Ailill &quot;in flagrante&quot;, she ordered Conall to kill him, which he was happy to do in revenge for Fergus. However, the dying Ailill sent his men after him, and he was killed while trying to escape.

==Death==
In her later years, Medb often went to bathe in a pool on Inchcleraun (Inis Cloithreann), an island on Lough Ree, near Knockcroghery. Furbaide sought revenge for the death of his mother. He took a rope and measured the distance between the pool and the shore, and practised with his sling until he could hit an apple on top of a stake Medb&#x27;s height from that distance. The next time he saw Medb bathing he put his practice to good use and killed her with a piece of cheese. She was succeeded to the throne of Connacht by her son Maine Athramail.

According to legend, Medb is buried in Miosgán Médhbh, a high stone cairn on the summit of Knocknarea (&quot;Cnoc na Ré&quot; in Irish) in County Sligo. Supposedly, she is buried upright facing her enemies in Ulster. Her home in Rathcroghan, County Roscommon is also a potential burial site, with a long low slab named &#x27;Misgaun Medb&#x27; being given as the most likely location.

==Interpretations==
Tomás Ó Máille was the first to suggest in 1928, that Medb is probably an allegorical figure representing the sovereignty of Connacht, &quot;whom a king would ritually marry as part of his inauguration.&quot; Medb Lethderg, who performs a similar function in Tara, is probably identical with or the inspiration for this Medb. Her name is said to mean &#x27;she who intoxicates&#x27;, and is cognate with the English word &#x27;mead&#x27;; it is likely that the sacred marriage ceremony between the king and the goddess would involve a shared drink. Medb&#x27;s &quot;pillow talk&quot; argument with her consort contains suggestions of matrilineality, as does Ailill&#x27;s taking his name from his mother Máta Muirisc. Recently, Irish and Irish-American poets have explored Medb as an image of woman&#x27;s power, including sexuality, as in &quot;Labhrann Medb&quot; (&quot;Medb Speaks&quot;) by Irish-language poet Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill and &quot;Intoxication&quot; by Irish-American poet Patricia Monaghan.

The name &quot;Connacht&quot; is an apparent anachronism: the stories of the Ulster Cycle are traditionally set around the time of Christ, but the Connachta, after whom the province is named, were said to have been the descendants of Conn Cétchathach, who is supposed to have lived several centuries later. Later stories use the name Cóiced Ol nEchmacht as an earlier name for the province of Connacht to get around this problem. But the chronology of early Irish historical tradition is an artificial attempt by Christian monks to synchronise native traditions with classical and biblical history, and it is possible that the cycle has been chronologically misplaced.

<text>The International Boxing Federation (IBF) is one of four major organizations recognized by the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF) which sanctions professional boxing bouts. The others are the World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Organization (WBO).

==History==
The IBF was preceded by the United States Boxing Association (USBA), a regional championship organization like the North American Boxing Federation (NABF). In 1983, at the WBA&#x27;s annual convention, held in Puerto Rico, Robert W. &quot;Bobby&quot; Lee Sr., president of the USBA, lost in his bid to become WBA president against Gilberto Mendoza. Lee and others withdrew from the convention after the election, and decided to organize a third, world-level organization, to co-exist with the WBA and the WBC. Formed as USBA-International, the fledgling organization was renamed the International Boxing Federation on November 6, 1983, based in New Jersey, where its main offices remain.

Bobby Lee had also been a New Jersey boxing commissioner until 1985, when, according to news reports, &quot;he was suspended and fined by the Ethical Standards Commission for accepting contributions from fight promoters and casino executives.&quot;

The IBF&#x27;s first world champion was Marvin Camel, a former WBC world cruiserweight champion who won the IBF&#x27;s belt in the same division. During its first year of existence the IBF remained largely obscure, but by 1984 it decided to recognize Larry Holmes, Aaron Pryor, Marvin Hagler and Donald Curry, already established champions from other organizations, as IBF world champions. In Holmes&#x27; case, he relinquished his WBC title to accept the IBF&#x27;s recognition. It established the IBF as the third sanctioning body, and a legitimate organization.

IBF men&#x27;s world championship belts are red, whereas women&#x27;s world championship belts are light blue.

=== 20th-century bribery scandal===
Despite achieving an appearance of legitimacy, subsequent to a three-year investigation started by 1996 charges levied by former heavyweight champion Michael Moorer; IBF&#x27;s reputation was ruined in 1999 with founder Lee&#x27;s indictment for racketeering and other violations for taking bribes in exchange for high boxer rankings. Indicted on federal racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges were &quot;president, Robert W. Lee, 65; his son and IBF liaison, Robert Lee Jr., 38; former IBF executive and Virginia boxing commissioner Donald William Brennan, 86; and South American IBF representative Francisco Fernandez.&quot; Lee was subsequently convicted of money-laundering and tax evasion in August 2000, then sentenced, in 2001, to 22 months in prison and fined $25,000.

In 2000, citing extortion, boxing promoter Bob Arum voluntarily testified to having paid IBF president Bobby Lee $100,000 in two installments in 1995, as the first half of a $200,000 bribe, through &quot;middleman, Stanley Hoffman&quot;, adding that Lee had first demanded $500,000 to approve the Schulz-Foreman fight, but had settled for the lesser amount of $200,000 (half of which was never paid). Arum was sanctioned and fined $125,000 by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Boxing promoters Cedric Kushner and Dino Duva also admitted to making similar payments to Lee.

===21st-century management===
The IBF was under federal observation from Lee&#x27;s conviction through September 2004. Former Michigan Boxing Commissioner, WBA vice-president, boxing safety advocate and IBF interim president Hiawatha Knight (October 22, 1929 – October 22, 2014) became president following Lee&#x27;s conviction, and was the first woman president of any world governing boxing organization. In 2001, Marian Muhammad assumed the presidency, followed by Daryl J. Peoples, who remained president as of 2018.

The IBF ran the &quot;1st Annual Convention of IBF Muaythai&quot; in Bangkok on 20–21 December 2017. Daryl Peoples, IBF president, attended the convention. The new champions of IBF Muay Thai were crowned in three weight divisions.

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Federation blocked championship fights involving Russian and Belarusian boxers.

<doc id="241040" wikidata="Q847168" url="?curid=241040" title="Tenerife blue chaffinch">
<text>The Tenerife blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea) is a species of passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is endemic to Tenerife in Spain&#x27;s Canary Islands. This bird is the natural symbol of this island, together with the Canary Islands dragon tree.

==Taxonomy==
Until 2015, the species &quot;Fringilla teydea&quot; was classified into two subspecies: &quot;Fringilla teydea polatzeki&quot; from Gran Canaria and &quot;Fringilla teydea teydea&quot; from Tenerife. However, a study published in March 2016 showed that a classification as different species, &quot;Fringilla polatzeki&quot; and &quot;Fringilla teydea&quot;, is justified.

==Description==
Tenerife blue chaffinches resemble common chaffinches, but they are noticeably larger, and have a thicker bill. They are characteristically more uniform in their plumage, and they lack a dark cap. Females are a dull grey-brown, but can be distinguished from chaffinches by their weaker wing bars. Breeding males are unmistakable, with the namesake largely blue plumage and a grey bill.

==Distribution==
This bird is found only in the highlands of Tenerife.

The species&#x27; primary habitat is mountain Canary Island pine (&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;) forest. It is most common in coniferous forest areas with dense undergrowth, but it is also found in laurel and pine woodland, tree-heath, and scrub.
It prefers habitat at around , but it will descend in bad weather.

==Behaviour==
The Tenerife blue chaffinch&#x27;s song is shorter and weaker than that of the common chaffinch, and the flight call is croakier. It primarily eats Canary Island pine seeds. Like the common chaffinch, but unlike most other finches, its young are fed extensively on insects. Breeding from the end of April to late July or early August, it builds a nest from pine needles and broom branches, and lays two eggs. This bird is not migratory. Individuals may form small flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes associating with common chaffinches and other finches.

<doc id="241042" wikidata="Q662013" url="?curid=241042" title="Josef Martin Knüsel">
<text>Melchior Josef Martin Knüsel (16 November 1813 – 14 January 1889) was a Swiss jurist and politician from the Liberal Radical Party (FDP) and member of the Federal Council of Switzerland over which he presided in 1861 and 1866. Before he was also a member of the Grand Council and the Executive Council of Lucerne and also of the National Council.

== Education and early life ==
Knüsel was born into a Catholic household on the 16 November 1813 in Lucerne to Melchior Josef and Josefa (born Küttel) Knüsel. His father had a grocery store and he grew up in a financially stable household. He attended primary and high school in Lucerne and decided to study jurisprudence. In the 1830s he studied law at the University of Göttingen between 1834 and 36 and the following year at Heidelberg. In 1838 he graduated with the Lucernese State Exam. He then stayed for some months in Romont and Lausanne to further his knowledge of the French language.

== Professional career ==
In 1838 Knüsel was appointed a provisory clerk of the criminal court and in 1839 he became a criminal judge. In 1841 the conservative leaning Grand Council of Lucerne elected him to become the provincial prosecutor despite the fact that he had become a member of the Liberal party. He stayed the provincial prosecutor until 1852. Prominent investigations he led were the one against Jakob Robert Steiger and his rebels and one against some members of the clergy of the Monastery of the Franciscans.

== Political career ==
In 1847 Knüsel succeeded his father into the Grand Council of Lucerne representing Weggis. He was formally elected to the Grand Council of Lucerne in 1848 but declined to become a member of the Council of States. He was in favor of an amnesty for the rebels around Jakob Robert Steiger in 1849. When Steiger resigned from the Executive Council in 1852 after he failed in his aim to support the construction of railways by the state, Knüsel was then considered his successor. In 1853 he was involved in the development of a railway connecting Basel and Lucerne over Sursee. For this he was in frequent contact with Johann Jakob Speiser, the president of the Swiss Central Railways. In September 1854 Knüsel was able to prevent violent riots against the grain merchants, who were accused of raising prices too much. Later the same year he was elected into the National Council of Switzerland.

=== Federal Councilor ===
Knüsel&#x27;s election to the Federal Council was a surprise as after the death of the Federal Councilor Josef Munzinger, initially Casimir Pfyffer was the most voted candidate, but after Pfyffer failed to achieve the parliamentary majority of 72 votes in the first round, he declined. Knüsel was also a candidate, but only received 23 votes. Then Johann Jakob Stehlin was elected as the Federal Councilor on the 12 July, but he refused to accept his election as he didn&#x27;t feel prepared for the office. Following Melchior Josef Martin Knüsel was again made a candidate and elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 14 July 1855. After several day he eventually accepted and became the first Federal Councilor from Canton Lucerne. He stayed a Federal Councilor for over 20 years until he resigned on 10 December 1875. 

When he was in charge of the Department of Trade and Customs in 1860, he was in favor of a soon to be constructed tunnel through the Alps, to connect northern Europe with Italy. He saw with concerns the developments of France and the Austrian Empire to construct a railway over the Brenner or Mount Cenis and worried that in the case they succeed before Switzerland achieved its own tunnel, international traffic would lead around Switzerland which then would lose its central position. He reasoned that in case Switzerland would achieve a tunnel, then the country would become an economic hub for goods coming from the Italian Port of Genoa towards Northern Europe and the Swiss population would also have an enhanced access to the grains of northern Italy. He strongly favored the construction of the railway tunnel through the Gotthard massif instead of a variant through the Lukmanier. In 1873 the ideological gap between the reformists and the catholics emerged as the reason of Knüsel&#x27;s eventual loss in the Federal Council. 

After Pope Pius IX. harshly criticised the Church Laws in Geneva and Solothurn, the Federal Council recalled the Swiss ambassador to the Holy See. Knüsel, as the only catholic in the Federal Council, did not support this step which caused some opposition in his canton Lucerne. When in 1875 the confirmative elections were to be held, he was made a candidate in a conservative district, where he didn&#x27;t have a chance and lost, following which he resigned. 

As an acting Federal Councillor, Knüsel was a candidate for the National Council in 1866, 1869, 1872 and 1875 in confirmative elections, which would formally confirm that he had enough popular support of the population. 

==== Offices in the Federal Council ====
While in office Knüsel held the following departments:
* Department of Finance (1855 - 1856)
* Department of Trade and Customs (1857)
* Department of Justice and Police (1858)
* Department of Trade and Customs (1859 - 1860)
* Political Department (1861) as President of the Swiss Confederation
* Department of Finance (1862 - 1863)
* Department of Justice and Police (1864 - 1865)
* Political Department (1866) as President of the Swiss Confederation
* Department of Justice and Police (1867 - 1873)
* Federal Department of Home Affairs (1874 - 1875)
As a civilian (non-military), he was not allowed to become involved in the Military Department. He became President of the Confederation twice, in 1861 and 1866.

== Later life ==
Knüsel resigned from politics in 1875 and returned to Lucerne where in 1876 he was elected the President of the Lucerne branch of the (SGG). The following year the SGG held their annual congress in Lucerne. He supported Free Trade and the workers, for which he demanded education and machinery to be able to compete with the large corporations. In 1878, he returned to politics when he was elected into the National Council until 1881. On the 14 January 1889, Knüsel died after having been treated for rheumatism and a heart condition.

== Personal life ==
In 1847 Knüsel married Bernardine Brunner from Ebikon. Their marriage stayed childless. On the 17 July he saved the life of a child that fell into Lake Lucerne, for which he was officially recognized by the President of the Executive Council Alois Singer. Later that year, he was able to be liberated from the remainder of his military service by paying 80 Swiss Francs. His wife Bernardine Brunner was a known friend of Agata Pioda the wife of the former Federal Councillor and Swiss Ambassador to Rome Giovanni Battista Pioda.

<text>The River Boyne ( or &quot;Abhainn na Bóinne&quot;) is a river in Leinster, Ireland, the course of which is about long. It rises at Trinity Well, Newberry Hall, near Carbury, County Kildare, and flows north-east through County Meath to reach the Irish Sea between Mornington, County Meath, and Baltray, County Louth.

== Names and etymology ==
This river has been known since ancient times. The Greek geographer Ptolemy drew a map of Ireland in the 2nd century that included the Boyne, which he called (&quot;Bouwinda&quot;) or (&quot;Boubinda&quot;), which in Celtic means &quot;white cow&quot; (). During the High Middle Ages, Giraldus Cambrensis called it the &quot;Boandus&quot;. In Irish mythology it is said that the river was created by the goddess Boann and Boyne is an anglicised form of the name. In other legends, it was in this river where Fionn mac Cumhail captured Fiontán, the Salmon of Knowledge. The Meath section of the Boyne was also known as &quot;Smior Fionn Feidhlimthe&quot; (the &#x27;marrow of Fionn Feilim&#x27;). The tidal estuary of the Boyne, which extends inland as far as the confluence with the Mattock River, &#x27;the curly hole&#x27;, had a number of names in Irish literature and was associated as a place of departure and arrival in the ancient legends and myths, such as The Tragedy of the Sons of Tuireann, Togail Bruidne Dá Derga, &amp;c. In the Acallam na Senórach the estuary has the name &quot;Inber Bic Loingsigh&quot;, abounding in ships. &quot;Inber Colpa&quot; or &quot;Inber Colptha&quot; was the principal name for the mouth of the Boyne in early medieval times. The townlands and civil parish of Colp, or Colpe on its southern shore preserve the name. It was associated in myth with Colpa of the Sword, a son of Míl Espáine, in the Milesian origin of the Irish, who drowned in the attempt to land there and is by tradition buried in the ringfort behind Colpe church. An alternative Dindsenchas tradition associates the name with the Máta, a massive aquatic creature, which having been killed was dismembered at Brú na Bóinne was thrown in the Boyne. Its shinbone (colptha) reached the estuary giving name to Inber Colptha.

== Course and geography ==
The Boyne is a lowland river, surrounded by the Boyne Valley. It is crossed just west of Drogheda by the Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge, which carries the M1 motorway, and by the Boyne Viaduct, which carries the Dublin–Belfast railway line to the east. The catchment area of the River Boyne is 2,695 km2. The long-term average flow rate of the River Boyne is per second.

===Significance===
Despite its short course, the Boyne has historical, archaeological and mythical connotations. The Battle of the Boyne, a major battle in Irish history, took place along the Boyne near Drogheda in 1690 during the Williamite war in Ireland. It passes through the ancient town of Trim, Trim Castle, the Hill of Tara (the ancient capital of the High King of Ireland), Navan, the Hill of Slane, Brú na Bóinne (a complex of megalithic monuments), Mellifont Abbey, and the medieval town of Drogheda. In the Boyne Valley can also be found other historical and archaeological monuments, including Loughcrew, Kells, Celtic crosses, and castles.

== History ==

=== Boyne Canal ===

The Boyne Navigation is a series of canals running roughly parallel to the main river from Oldbridge near Drogheda to Navan. The navigation, owned by An Taisce and mostly derelict, is being restored to navigable status by the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland. The canal at Oldbridge, which runs through the Battle of the Boyne site, was the first to be restored.

=== Prehistoric art ===
A rock that showed indications of being prehistoric art was found in August 2013. Cliadh O&#x27;Gibne reported through the Archaeological Survey of Ireland that a boulder with geometric carvings had been found in Donore, County Meath.

=== Ancient log-boat ===
Workers from the Boyne Fishermen&#x27;s Rescue and Recovery Service (BFRRS), near Drogheda, County Louth, were performing one of its regular operations to remove shopping trolleys from the Boyne, in May 2013, when they discovered an ancient log-boat, which experts believe may be 5000 years old. Initial examination by an underwater archaeologist suggested that it could be very rare because, unlike other log-boats found here, it has oval shapes on the upper edge that could have held oars. Investigations were ongoing as of 2013.

=== Viking ship ===
In 2006, the remains of a Viking ship were found in the river bed in Drogheda during dredging operations. The vessel is to be excavated as it poses a hazard to navigation.

===Annalistic references===
* AI770.2 The battle of Bolg Bóinne [gained] against the Uí Néill, by the Laigin.

== Flora and fauna ==
Several species of trout inhabit the Boyne: brook trout, brown trout and introduced rainbow trout. There is also a steelhead in the spring, and naturally reproducing salmon in the fall.

<doc id="241047" wikidata="Q225045" url="?curid=241047" title="Carbon tetrachloride">
<text>Carbon tetrachloride, also known by many other names (such as carbon tet for short and tetrachloromethane, also recognised by the IUPAC), is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CCl4. It is a non-flammable, dense, colourless liquid with a &quot;sweet&quot; chloroform-like odour that can be detected at low levels. It was formerly widely used in fire extinguishers, as a precursor to refrigerants, an anthelmintic and a cleaning agent, but has since been phased out because of environmental and safety concerns. Exposure to high concentrations of carbon tetrachloride can affect the central nervous system and degenerate the liver and kidneys. Prolonged exposure can be fatal.

==Properties==
In the carbon tetrachloride molecule, four chlorine atoms are positioned symmetrically as corners in a tetrahedral configuration joined to a central carbon atom by single covalent bonds. Because of this symmetric geometry, CCl4 is non-polar. Methane gas has the same structure, making carbon tetrachloride a halomethane. As a solvent, it is well suited to dissolving other non-polar compounds such as fats and oils. It can also dissolve iodine. It is volatile, giving off vapors with an odor characteristic of other chlorinated solvents, somewhat similar to the tetrachloroethylene odor reminiscent of dry cleaners&#x27; shops.

Solid tetrachloromethane has two polymorphs: crystalline II below −47.5°C (225.6 K) and crystalline I above −47.5°C. At −47.3°C it has monoclinic crystal structure with space group &quot;C2/c&quot; and lattice constants &quot;a&quot; = 20.3, &quot;b&quot; = 11.6, &quot;c&quot; = 19.9 (.10−1 nm), β = 111°.

With a specific gravity greater than 1, carbon tetrachloride will be present as a dense nonaqueous phase liquid if sufficient quantities are spilt in the environment.

==Reactions==
Despite being generally inert, carbon tetrachloride can undergo various reactions. Hydrogen or an acid in the presence of an iron catalyst can reduce carbon tetrachloride to chloroform, dichloromethane, chloromethane and even methane. When its vapours are passed through a red-hot tube, carbon tetrachloride dechlorinates to tetrachloroethylene and hexachloroethane.

Carbon tetrachloride, when treated with HF, gives various compounds such as trichlorofluoromethane (R-11), dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12), chlorotrifluoromethane (R-13) and carbon tetrafluoride with HCl as the by-product:
:
:
This was once one of the main uses of carbon tetrachloride, as R-11 and R-12 were widely used as refrigerants.

An alcohol solution of potassium hydroxide decomposes it to potassium chloride and potassium carbonate in water:

Carbon is sufficiently oxophilic that many compounds react to give phosgene:

Reaction with hydrogen sulfide gives thiophosgene:

==History and synthesis==
Carbon tetrachloride was originally synthesized in 1820 by Michael Faraday, who named it &quot;protochloride of carbon&quot;, by decomposition of hexachloroethane (&quot;perchloride of carbon&quot;) which he synthesized by chlorination of ethylene. The protochloride of carbon has been previously misidentified as tetrachloroethylene because it can be made with the same reaction of hexachloroethane. Later in the 19th century, the name &quot;protochloride of carbon&quot; was used for tetrachloroethylene, and carbon tetrachloride was called &quot;bichloride of carbon&quot; or &quot;perchloride of carbon&quot;. Henri Victor Regnault developed another method to synthesise carbon tetrachloride from chloroform, chloroethane or methanol with excess chlorine in 1839.

Kolbe made carbon tetrachloride in 1845 by passing chlorine over carbon disulfide through a porcelain tube. Prior to the 1950s, carbon tetrachloride was manufactured by the chlorination of carbon disulfide at 105 to 130 °C:

:CS2 + 3 Cl2 → CCl4 + S2Cl2

But now it is mainly produced from methane:

:CH4 + 4 Cl2 → CCl4 + 4 HCl

The production often utilizes by-products of other chlorination reactions, such as from the syntheses of dichloromethane and chloroform. Higher chlorocarbons are also subjected to this process named &quot;chlorinolysis&quot;:

:C2Cl6 + Cl2 → 2 CCl4

The production of carbon tetrachloride has steeply declined since the 1980s because of environmental concerns and the decreased demand for CFCs, which were derived from carbon tetrachloride. In 1992, production in the U.S./Europe/Japan was estimated at 720,000 tonnes.

===Natural occurrence===
Carbon tetrachloride was discovered along with chloromethane and chloroform in oceans, marine algae and volcanoes. Natural emissions of carbon tetrachloride are insignificant compared to anthropogenic sources; for example, the Momotombo volcano in Nicaragua emits carbon tetrachloride at a flux of 82 grams per year while the global industrial emissions were at 2 × 1010 grams per year.

Carbon tetrachloride was found in red algae, specifically &quot;Asparagopsis taxiformis&quot; and &quot;Asparagopsis armata&quot;. It was detected in Southern Californian ecosystems, salt lakes of the Kalmykian steppe and a common liverwort in the Czech Republic.

==Safety==
At high temperatures in air, it decomposes or burns to produce poisonous phosgene. This was a common problem when carbon tetrachloride was used as a fire extinguisher and there have been deaths due to its conversion to phosgene reported.

Carbon tetrachloride is a suspected human carcinogen but there is no sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. The World Health Organization reports carbon tetrachloride can induce hepatocellular carcinomas (hepatomas) in mice and rats. The doses inducing hepatic tumors in mice and rats are higher than those inducing cell toxicity. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified this compound in Group 2B, &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;. 

Carbon tetrachloride is one of the most potent hepatotoxins (toxic to the liver), so much so that it is widely used in scientific research to evaluate hepatoprotective agents. Exposure to high concentrations of carbon tetrachloride (including vapor) can affect the central nervous system and degenerate the liver and kidneys, and prolonged exposure may lead to coma or death. Chronic exposure to carbon tetrachloride can cause liver and kidney damage and could result in cancer.

Consumption of alcohol increases the toxic effects of carbon tetrachloride and may cause more severe organ damage, such as acute renal failure, in heavy drinkers. The doses that can cause mild toxicity to non-drinkers can be fatal to drinkers.

The effects of carbon tetrachloride on human health and the environment have been assessed under REACH in 2012 in the context of the substance evaluation by France.

In 2008, a study of common cleaning products found the presence of carbon tetrachloride in &quot;very high concentrations&quot; (up to 101 mg/m3) as a result of manufacturers&#x27; mixing of surfactants or soap with sodium hypochlorite (bleach).

Carbon tetrachloride is also both ozone-depleting and a greenhouse gas. However, since 1992 its atmospheric concentrations have been in decline for the reasons described above (see atmospheric concentration graphs in the gallery). CCl4 has an atmospheric lifetime of 85 years.

==Uses==
In organic chemistry, carbon tetrachloride serves as a source of chlorine in the Appel reaction.

Carbon tetrachloride made from heavy chlorine-37 has been used in the detection of neutrinos and antineutrinos. Raymond Davis Jr. used carbon tetrachloride in his experiments to detect antineutrinos.

==Historical uses==
Carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a dry cleaning solvent, as a refrigerant, and in lava lamps. In the last case, carbon tetrachloride is a key ingredient that adds weight to the otherwise buoyant wax.

One speciality use of carbon tetrachloride was in stamp collecting, to reveal watermarks on postage stamps without damaging them. A small amount of the liquid is placed on the back of a stamp, sitting in a black glass or obsidian tray. The letters or design of the watermark can then be seen clearly. Today, this is done on lit tables without using carbon tetrachloride.

===Cleaning===
Being a good solvent for many materials (such as grease and tar), carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a cleaning fluid for nearly 70 years. It is nonflammable and nonexplosive and did not leave any odour on the cleaned material, unlike gasoline, which was also used for cleaning at the time. It was used as a &quot;safe&quot; alternative to gasoline. It was first marketed as Katharin, in 1890 or 1892 and as Benzinoform later.

Carbon tetrachloride was recommended for regularly cleaning the type slugs of typewriters in office settings in the 1940s.

Carbon tetrachloride was the first chlorinated solvent to be used in dry-cleaning and was used until the 1950s. It had the downsides of being corrosive to the dry-cleaning equipment and causing illness among dry-cleaning operators, and was replaced by trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and methyl chloroform (trichloroethane).

Carbon tetrachloride was also used as an alternative to petrol (gasoline) in dry shampoos, from the beginning of 1903 to the 1930s. Several women had fainted from its fumes during the hair wash in barber shops, the hairdressers often used electric fans to blow the fumes away. In 1909, a baronet&#x27;s daughter, Helenora Elphinstone-Dalrymple (aged 29), died after having her hair shampooed with carbon tetrachloride.

It is assumed that carbon tetrachloride was still used as a dry cleaning solvent in North Korea as of 2006.

=== Medical uses ===
====Anaesthetic and analgesic====
Carbon tetrachloride was briefly used as a volatile inhalation anaesthetic and analgesic for intense menstruation pains and headaches in the mid-19th century. Its anaesthetic effects were known as early as 1847 or 1848.

It was introduced as a safer alternative to chloroform by the doctor Protheroe Smith in 1864. In December 1865, the Scottish obstetrician who discovered the anaesthetic effects of chloroform on humans, James Young Simpson, had experimented with carbon tetrachloride as an anaesthetic. Simpson named the compound &quot;Chlorocarbon&quot; for its similarity to chloroform. His experiments involved injecting carbon tetrachloride into two women&#x27;s vaginas. Simpson orally consumed carbon tetrachloride and described it as having &quot;the same effect as swallowing a capsule of chloroform&quot;.

Because of the higher amount of chlorine atoms (compared to chloroform) in its molecule, carbon tetrachloride has a stronger anaesthetic effect than chloroform and required a smaller amount. Its anaesthetic action was likened to ether, rather than the related chloroform. It is less volatile than chloroform, therefore it was more difficult to apply and needed warm water to evaporate. Its smell has been described as &quot;fruity&quot;, quince-like and &quot;more pleasant than chloroform&quot;, and had a &quot;pleasant taste&quot;. Carbon tetrachloride for anaesthetic use was made by the chlorination of carbon disulfide. It was used on at least 50 patients, of which most were women in labour. During anaesthesia, carbon tetrachloride has caused such violent muscular contractions and negative effects on the heart in some patients that it had to be replaced with chloroform or ether. Such use was experimental and the anaesthetic use of carbon tetrachloride never gained popularity due to its potential toxicity.

====Parasite medication====

The veterinary doctor Maurice Crowther Hall (1881-1938) discovered in 1921 that carbon tetrachloride was incredibly effective as an anthelminthic in eradicating hookworm via ingestion. In one of the clinical trials of carbon tetrachloride, it was tested on criminals to determine its safety for use in human beings. Beginning in 1922, capsules of pure carbon tetrachloride were marketed by Merck under the name Necatorina (variants include Neo-necatorina and Necatorine). Necatorina was used as a medication against parasitic diseases in humans. This medication was most prevalently used in Latin American countries. Its toxicity was not well understood at the time and toxic effects were attributed to impurities in the capsules rather than carbon tetrachloride itself. Due to carbon tetrachloride&#x27;s toxicity, tetrachloroethylene (which was also investigated by Hall in 1925) replaced its use as an anthelmintic by the 1940s.

===Solvent===
It once was a popular solvent in organic chemistry, but because of its adverse health effects, it is rarely used today. It is sometimes useful as a solvent for infrared spectroscopy, because there are no significant absorption bands above 1600 cm−1. Because carbon tetrachloride does not have any hydrogen atoms, it was historically used in proton NMR spectroscopy. In addition to being toxic, its dissolving power is low. Its use in NMR spectroscopy has been largely superseded by deuterated solvents (mainly deuterochloroform). The use of carbon tetrachloride in the determination of oil has been replaced by various other solvents, such as tetrachloroethylene. Because it has no C–H bonds, carbon tetrachloride does not easily undergo free-radical reactions. It is a useful solvent for halogenations either by the elemental halogen or by a halogenation reagent such as &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide (these conditions are known as Wohl–Ziegler bromination).

===Fire suppression===
Between 1902 and 1908, carbon tetrachloride-based fire extinguishers began to appear in the United States, years after Europe.

In 1910, the Pyrene Manufacturing Company of Delaware filed a patent to use carbon tetrachloride to extinguish fires. The liquid was vaporized by the heat of combustion and extinguished flames, an early form of gaseous fire suppression. At the time it was believed the gas displaced oxygen in the area near the fire, but later research found that the gas inhibited the chemical chain reaction of the combustion process.

In 1911, Pyrene patented a small, portable extinguisher that used the chemical. The extinguisher consisted of a brass bottle with an integrated hand-pump that was used to expel a jet of liquid toward the fire. As the container was unpressurized, it could easily be refilled after use. Carbon tetrachloride was suitable for liquid and electrical fires and the extinguishers were often carried on aircraft or motor vehicles. However, as early as 1920, there were reports of fatalities caused by the chemical when used to fight a fire in a confined space.

In the first half of the 20th century, another common fire extinguisher was a single-use, sealed glass globe, a &quot;fire grenade, &quot; filled with carbon tetrachloride or salt water. The bulb could be thrown at the base of the flames to quench the fire. The carbon tetrachloride type could also be installed in a spring-loaded wall fixture with a solder-based restraint. When the solder melted by high heat, the spring would either break the globe or launch it out of the bracket, allowing the extinguishing agent to be automatically dispersed into the fire.

Since carbon tetrachloride freezes at –23 °C, the fire extinguishers would contain only 89-90% carbon tetrachloride and 10% trichloroethylene (m.p. –85 °C) or chloroform (m.p. –63 °C) for lowering the extinguishing mixture&#x27;s freezing point down to temperatures as low as –45 °C. The extinguishers with 10% trichloroethylene would contain 1% carbon disulfide as a stabiliser.

=== Refrigerants ===
Prior to the Montreal Protocol, large quantities of carbon tetrachloride were used to produce the chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants R-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) and R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane). However, these refrigerants play a role in ozone depletion and have been phased out. Carbon tetrachloride is still used to manufacture less destructive refrigerants.

===Fumigant===
Carbon tetrachloride was widely used as a fumigant to kill insect pests in stored grain. It was employed in a mixture known as 80/20, that was 80% carbon tetrachloride and 20% carbon disulfide. The United States Environmental Protection Agency banned its use in 1985.

Another carbon tetrachloride fumigant preparation mixture contained acrylonitrile. Carbon tetrachloride reduced the flammability of the mixture. Most common trade names for the preparation were &quot;Acritet&quot;, &quot;Carbacryl&quot; and &quot;Acrylofume&quot;. The most common preparation, &quot;Acritet&quot;, was prepared with 34 percent acrylonitrile and 66 percent carbon tetrachloride.

==Society and culture==
* The French writer René Daumal intoxicated himself by inhalation of carbon tetrachloride which he used to kill the beetles he collected, to &quot;encounter other worlds&quot; by voluntarily plunging himself into intoxications close to comatose states.
* Carbon tetrachloride is listed (along with salicylic acid, toluene, sodium tetraborate, silica gel, methanol, potassium carbonate, ethyl acetate and &quot;BHA&quot;) as an ingredient in Peter Parker&#x27;s (Spider-Man) custom web fluid formula in the book &quot;The Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond&quot;.
* Australian YouTuber Tom of &quot;Explosions&amp;Fire&quot; and &quot;Extractions&amp;Ire&quot; made a video on extracting carbon tetrachloride from an old fire extinguisher in 2019, and later experimenting with it by mixing it with sodium, and the chemical gained a fan base called &quot;Tet Gang&quot; on social media (especially on Reddit). The channel owner later used carbon tetrachloride-themed designs in the channel&#x27;s merch.
* In the Ramones song &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot; released in 1977, the narrator says that huffing the vapours of &quot;Carbona&quot;, a carbon tetrachloride-based stain remover, was better than huffing glue. They later removed the song from the album as &quot;Carbona&quot; was a corporate trademark.

===Famous deaths from carbon tetrachloride poisoning===
* Evalyn Bostock (1917–1944), British actress who died from accidentally drinking carbon tetrachloride after mistaking it for her drink while working in a photographic darkroom.
* Harry Edwards (1887–1952), an American director who died from carbon tetrachloride poisoning shortly after directing his first television production.
* Zilphia Horton (1910–1956), American musician and activist who died from accidentally drinking a glass full of carbon tetrachloride-based typewriter cleaning fluid that she mistook for water.
* Margo Jones (1911–1955), American stage director who was exposed to the fumes of carbon tetrachloride that was used to clean off paint from a carpet. She died a week later from kidney failure.
* Jim Beck (1919–1956), American record producer, died after exposure to carbon tetrachloride fumes while cleaning recording equipment.
* Tommy Tucker (1933–1982), American blues singer, died after using carbon tetrachloride in floor refinishing.

<text>The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There is a 2001 neo-noir crime film written, directed, produced and co-edited by Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Billy Bob Thornton, Frances McDormand, Michael Badalucco, Richard Jenkins, Scarlett Johansson, Jon Polito, Tony Shalhoub, and James Gandolfini. The film is set in 1949 and tells the story of Ed Crane, a withdrawn barber who leads an ordinary life in a small California town with his wife, who he suspects is having an affair with her boss. Crane&#x27;s situation changes when a stranger comes to the barbershop and offers him the opportunity to join him as a partner in a promising new business, in exchange for an investment of ten thousand dollars. Drawn to the idea, Crane plans to blackmail his wife&#x27;s lover for the money.

The film is in black-and-white and employs voiceover narration, honoring classic film noir. It differs by including classical music, setting the plot in a small town, and featuring a protagonist from outside the criminal underworld. The Coens began developing the idea from a 1940s haircut poster they saw while filming &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;. The plot was influenced by James M. Cain&#x27;s crime novels, primarily &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;. Aesthetically, &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; was inspired by films from the 1940s and 1950s—including &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;—along with science fiction films and documentaries of the period.

Filming took place on location in California. It was shot in color and later converted to black and white. The film premiered and participated in the official selection at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where Joel Coen won the award for best director. Its theatrical response was lukewarm, although it was well-received by film critics, who praised Roger Deakins&#x27; cinematography and the performances, especially Thornton&#x27;s. Media critics in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the BBC, and &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; referred to it as one of the best films of the year. The National Board of Review included it among its top ten films of the year and awarded Thornton best actor. Deakins received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and the film achieved multiple nominations and awards from other organizations.

==Plot==

In 1949 Santa Rosa, California, Ed Crane is married to Doris, a bookkeeper with a drinking problem, and works in a barbershop that is owned by his brother-in-law, Frank. A customer named Creighton Tolliver tells Ed that he is a businessman looking for people to invest $10,000 in a new technology called dry cleaning. Ed decides to collect money by anonymously blackmailing Doris&#x27;s boss, &quot;Big Dave&quot; Brewster, whom he suspects is having an affair with her. Brewster embezzles money from his department store to pay the blackmail. However, Brewster soon pieces together the scheme and beats Tolliver to death after he implicates Ed. Brewster confronts Ed at the store and attempts to kill him, but Ed fatally stabs Brewster with a cigar knife in self-defense.

After irregularities in the store&#x27;s books are found, the police arrest Doris on the assumption that she embezzled the money and murdered Brewster. Ed is persuaded to hire Freddy Riedenschneider, a defense attorney from Sacramento, who arrives and takes up residence in the most expensive hotel in town. He proceeds to live lavishly on Doris&#x27;s defense fund, which Frank obtained by mortgaging the barbershop. On the morning of the first trial day, Doris hangs herself in her cell. It is later revealed that she was pregnant when she hanged herself but had not had sex with Ed for years. Frank, now deeply in debt, begins drinking heavily. Ed regularly visits Rachel &quot;Birdy&quot; Abundas, a friend&#x27;s teenage daughter, to hear her play the piano. Tormented by loneliness, he imagines helping her start a musical career and becoming her manager. The fantasy is crushed when a music teacher tells him that Birdy has no talent. On the way back from visiting the teacher, Birdy makes an incredibly direct pass at Ed, causing Ed to lose control of the car and crash.

Ed wakes up in a hospital bed where the police arrest him for murder. Tolliver&#x27;s beaten body has been found with Ed&#x27;s investment contract. The police speculate that Ed coerced Doris into embezzling the investment money, and killed Tolliver when he found out. Ed mortgages his house and hires Riedenschneider for his defense. During Riedenschneider&#x27;s opening statement, Frank attacks Ed and a mistrial is declared. With no means left for his defense, Ed throws himself at the mercy of the court. The tactic fails, and the judge sentences him to death. While waiting on death row, Ed writes his story to sell to a pulp magazine. Shortly before his execution, Ed sees a UFO outside the jailhouse. As Ed is electrocuted, he reflects on his fate, regretting none of his decisions and hoping to see Doris in the afterlife, both of them free of the mortal world&#x27;s imperfections.

==Background==
The idea of writing a film starring a barber was inspired by a poster that the Coen brothers saw while filming &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994). &quot;We filmed a scene in a barbershop, and there was a poster on the wall showing all the different 1940s-style haircuts,&quot; recalled Joel Coen. &quot;It was a fixture on the set, and we were always looking at it. So we started thinking about the guy who actually did the haircuts, and the story began to take shape. It really evolved from that haircut poster.&quot; The directors took the title of the film from the 1899 poem written by William Hughes Mearns entitled &quot;Antigonish&quot; and they chose it in reference to the character of the barber, to reflect his emotional emptiness.

Set in 1949, the plot—according to Joel Coen—&quot;is heavily influenced&quot; by the work of writer James M. Cain, in particular, the novels &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;. Despite being a neo-noir story, The Coens replaced the underworld setting with a typical American town with ordinary people. &quot;The criminal element here is sort of inadvertent. The hero sort of stumbles into it,&quot; Ethan Coen explained. This storytelling device was an homage to Cain, whose stories usually featured characters with conventional jobs who, motivated by need or greed, ended up involved in a crime. Other conventions were present in &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;, such as the plan to get money quickly, sexual misadventures, and coincidences of fate. The failure of a &quot;perfect plan&quot; to raise money appears in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, both novels narrated by down-and-out working-class men during the Great Depression.

The Coens named &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; as a reference to the film and had in mind the science fiction genre of the 1950s. The film&#x27;s aesthetics were influenced by science fiction cinema and &quot;cheap documentaries of the &#x27;50s&quot;. Cinematographer Roger Deakins drew inspiration for his work from the 1940s and 1950s films such as &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;, &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me Deadly&quot;, and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;. Likewise, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; Christopher Orr compared the voiceover and Crane&#x27;s reserved character with the character of Robert Mitchum in the film &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947). The Coens referred to other works through character names, as in the department store Nirdlinger or Dietrichson —surnames used in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;—Riedenschneider —the surname of a character from &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; — or the name of Tolliver&#x27;s hotel, &quot;The Hobart Arms&quot;, an homage to the novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; by Raymond Chandler.

In addition to Cain&#x27;s novels and film noir, the story borrowed ideas from existentialist literature, such as Albert Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;. In addition to noting the similarities in both works, authors and critics compared the disconnection with reality and Ed&#x27;s attitude with that of the protagonist of Camus&#x27;s novel. Through his main character, &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; explores the existentialist view of despair, a theme reminiscent of philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Authors Jean-Pierre Boulé and Enda McCaffrey compared Crane&#x27;s attempt to escape from his routine life with Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s idea of a &quot;search for transcendence&quot;. The film represented the protagonist&#x27;s relationship with the dry cleaning business, Abundas, and UFOs. Although &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;, cataloged as postmodern, inherited film noir thematic and narrative elements, at the same time it explored concepts of the post World War II period, portraying America&#x27;s early postwar years. The story was contextualized by events such as UFOs, references to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s reflections on humanity, and the idea of succeeding in an age of opportunity. The plot alludes to Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle through the character of defense attorney Riedenschneider, who refers to that principle more than once.

==Production==
===Development===
The Coen brothers began writing the script in the mid-1990s, after filming &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;. The brothers moved to Ireland — where Frances McDormand was working—to continue writing. The Coens sent the script to producers Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan of Working Title; they intended to start production in 1999, but taking advantage of the availability of George Clooney, they dedicated themselves to &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; Thereafter they continued with &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot;. The project was financed independently by Working Title which raised an approximate budget of $20 million.

The Coens wrote the characters of Doris and Frank for McDormand and Michael Badalucco, respectively. The directors grabbed Thornton, an actor with whom they had not worked before, for the title role. He accepted the role before reading the script: &quot;I knew that it would be good. There are certain people you know you can&#x27;t go wrong with.&quot; The Coens convinced James Gandolfini to be the boss. Jon Polito and Tony Shalhoub, two other actors already known to the Coens, joined the cast, followed by Adam Alexi-Malle, Katherine Borowitz, Richard Jenkins, and Johansson. Jenkins initially declined the opportunity to star because he had been rejected from three previous productions of the Coens. However, the directors eventually chose him for the role. Bill Murray was considered for the role that would ultimately be Thornton&#x27;s.

===Filming===
Filming began on June 26, 2000, in California and ended on September 1, after ten weeks. Deakins&#x27; cinematography was simple and traditional. Most of the shots were taken with the camera at eye level, with normal lenses and a long depth of field. Compared to older American film noir, Deakins used a wide range of grays and attempted to create low contrast without many strong shadows, using fewer and larger lights. He used contemporary technologies and wanted the film to reflect the era in which it was made: &quot;We&#x27;re not trying to make an old movie&quot;, said Deakins. It was filmed in 35 mm format in color and converted to black and white during post-production. This procedure was due, in part, to technical reasons since in recent decades the availability of black and white film rolls had become scarce. However, due to contractual and marketing requirements, it was released in color in some countries. &quot;The film wasn&#x27;t made to be seen in color&quot;, stated Joel Coen, mentioning that in color it would look &quot;horribly out of place&quot; due to grayscale neutralizing colors outside the time frame of the plot.

The set and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Mary Zophres, respectively, had to adapt to the absence of color, avoiding distracting high contrasts. Black and white also affected the actors, intensifying some elements: &quot;Just a close-up is very striking because of the shadows and the sense of depth,&quot; said McDormand. However, the team did not lose sight of the color version and designed the locations avoiding bright colors and preferring browns and grays. Ed Crane&#x27;s clothing consisted of sports jackets, gabardine and rayon shirts. Typical of those years, McDormand&#x27;s stockings had no elastic at the top, and — like the extras — she used garters to hold them up. Women&#x27;s clothing included seamed stockings, girdles, and pointy bras. Defense attorney Freddy Riedenschneider&#x27;s peaked lapel double-breasted suit was inspired by Salvador Dalí, according to costume designer Mary Zophres: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit unusual for the time and suggests opulence.&quot;

To compose his character&#x27;s look, Thornton looked at images of figures from that decade and borrowed some elements from Raymond Burr and Frank Sinatra. The actor commented, &quot;Once you get the right look, everything in your attitude changes&quot;. When Ed appears on screen, he is almost always seen smoking a Chesterfield. Professional barbers trained Thornton and Badalucco.

====Locations====
Filming began in the abandoned Lincoln Heights Jail in Los Angeles to set up a Santa Rosa city jail cell. Later, the team moved to East Los Angeles and then to the Musso &amp; Frank Grill restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard, where Ed Crane meets his attorney for the first time. Filming continued in Thousand Oaks for two days to shoot the country wedding scenes. Before his scenes, Michael Badalucco had to practice on pigs for the scene where he rides one. The production then returned to Los Angeles to film in a Presbyterian church on Wilshire Boulevard and in Downtown Los Angeles, where it was filmed in an apartment complex that was used to make the hotel lobby scenes. An abandoned Bank of America located also in the center was used for the scenes where Ed goes to the bank. The Nirdlingers building, where Doris works as an accountant, was created from an abandoned furniture store located in Glendale, production designer Dennis Gassner recalled:

A significant portion of the filming took place over a day in the city of Orange, which was used to represent the exteriors of the town of Santa Rosa, where the majority of the film is set. Although only one day was shot in Orange, the team worked for more than two weeks setting the streets according to the year 1949: traffic signs were replaced, facades were modified and minor street repairs were made. The exterior scenes of Ed Crane&#x27;s house were filmed in the Pasadena neighborhood of Bungalow Heaven, a popular and affordable location in the mid-twentieth century. The Coens chose the house with the lower ceiling to achieve the impression of a smaller space and thus represent the economic situation of the barber. The scenes in the piano teacher&#x27;s room were also shot in Pasadena, specifically in the Green Hotel building complex. Locations were used to film almost the entire film except for a few scenes, such as the barbershop scenes—the last ones before the end of filming—on a set built by Gassner at Paramount Studios.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack consists of classical music, primarily piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven, interspersed with seven new compositions by Carter Burwell. In addition to Beethoven, the soundtrack included a Mozart composition, &quot;Sull&#x27;aria ... che soave zeffiretto&quot;. The inclusion of classical music is a resource that distinguishes the film from others in the noir genre. Music editor Todd Kasow was tasked with selecting suitable sonatas for the soundtrack while Burwell began work on a &quot;pianocentric&quot; composition. Some of the compositions feature &quot;cyclical&quot; structures that symbolize the situation the protagonist finds himself in and his difficulty in freeing himself from it, but at the same time, the Coens felt it was essential to the character that the music suggests &quot;a vague longing&quot;. Journalist Dan Goldwasser described Burwell&#x27;s work as &quot;dark and solemn&quot; and wrote that the main composition, &quot;The Trial of Ed Crane&quot;, has &quot;a kind of romanticism with just a hint of hope&quot;. &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; was the ninth film on which Burwell collaborated with the Coen brothers. The Decca Records label released the soundtrack album on October 30, 2001.

==Release==
===Premiere===
The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 13, 2001. After Cannes, the film reached other European film festivals that year such as Edinburgh, Flanders, Warsaw, and Vienna. The distributor USA Films was in charge of its release in the United States, although its screening was limited to select theaters. On October 31, 2001, it premiered in Los Angeles and New York. It was the first Coen film to be released in black and white, something the directors had tried unsuccessfully with &quot;Blood Simple&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994) in the face of the advantages of color distribution.

===Home media===
The first home edition was available on DVD released by USA Home Entertainment in 2002. DVD extras included commentary by the Coen brothers and Thornton, a sixteen-minute making-of, an interview with Deakins, five deleted scenes, a photo gallery, and promotional videos. The Coens and Thornton share behind-the-scenes anecdotes, including the story about the haircut poster that inspired the idea for the film. In an in-depth interview with Deakins, the cinematographer discusses the pros and cons of shooting in black and white, his aesthetic influences, and his experience working with the Coens. Reviewing the DVD, the site DVD Talk wrote that the black-and-white photography &quot;is brilliantly captured, evoking film-noir history while remaining immaculately clean. The blacks are deep and solid, giving the image an enchanted look.&quot; In September 2002, a three-disc DVD edition was released in France: the first with the film in black and white, the second with the color version, and the last with the extras, which as a novelty included a documentary of almost fifty minutes entitled &quot;The Film Noir Universe&quot;. In 2015, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released a regular version on Blu-ray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; grossed $7.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $11.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $18.9 million against its $20 million budget. The film was the Coen Brothers&#x27; worst-performing film at the box office since &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994). Some speculated that the poor returns were because the film is in black and white. In its opening weekend in the United States, it grossed $664,404 from thirty-nine theaters.

===Critical response===

Many critics praised the film for its technique and performances. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;The ability to show no emotion isn&#x27;t a highly prized quality in movie leads, but Thornton, that splendid actor, does it perfectly as Ed Crane, a taciturn small-town barber, circa 1949&quot;. Other critics also praised Thornton&#x27;s leading role, such as Emanuel Levy, who opined that Thornton &quot;beautifully absolves himself in a challenging role that demands more reaction than action&quot; and added, &quot;he comes across as a tormented Montgomery Clift&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s protagonist &quot;sets new standards of opacity and passivity&quot;.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; noted: &quot;Joel and Ethan Coen stay true to their penchant for bumbling, neo-noir heroes, and their firm belief that life normally turns out lavishly horrific.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; commented, &quot;The film is effective and confident in its style, so loving and so intense that if you see it often, it will be like a party.&quot; In the same way, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of the best films of the year and expressed that it is &quot;devilishly funny&quot; and highlighted the photography and performances. Travers included &quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; at number eight on his list of the ten best indie films of 2001. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated: &quot;It&#x27;s the best American film of the year&quot; and Philip French, in another review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, also claimed that it was the best film of the year up to that point. Likewise, Marc Savlov of &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; announced that it was &quot;the most beautiful film of the year&quot; and added that &quot;Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s performance represents a dazzling rough diamond&quot;. The BBC Critic Nev Pierce also described it as &quot;one of the best films of the year&quot; and added about its viewing that it was &quot;a unique, peculiar, captivating experience.&quot;

Deakins&#x27;s black-and-white photography was singled out by several critics. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; compared the photography to Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; and reviewer Matthew Turner of &quot;View London&quot; commented that black and white &quot;hasn&#x27;t looked this splendid since the 1940s&quot;. Despite writing a lukewarm review, Todd McCarthy in &quot;Variety&quot; praised Deakins&#x27; work, Dennis Gassner&#x27;s sets, and Mary Zophres&#x27; costumes to create a &quot;superior representation of the post-war period in a small town&quot;. Concerning the rural setting, the historian José María Caparrós pointed out: &quot;Few times has American cinema appeared in such a subtle and forceful way to testify the deep existential emptiness and the mediocrity of deep America&quot;. The film did not convince Michael Sragow of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, who said: &quot;&quot;The Man Who Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; is an intellectualized, stylized, completely empty period production. Despite its lavish, claustrophobically controlled black-and-white look, it packs the punch of a toy gun.&quot; Similarly, David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it a “dud academic exercise”.

===Awards and nominations===
After its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Joel Coen took home Best Director No. 3 and shared the award with David Lynch for &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;. The film was also nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, the festival&#x27;s highest honor, but Nanni Moretti&#x27;s &quot;The Son&#x27;s Room&quot; won the prize. The film was part of the selection of the ten best of the year by the National Board of Review.

The film was nominated at the 74th Academy Awards in the category of Best Cinematography (Deakins), although the award ultimately went to Andrew Lesnie for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The film received three nominations for the Golden Globe Awards in the categories of Best Dramatic Film, Best Screenplay, and Best Dramatic Actor (Thornton), but failed to win any.

Deakins won the Best Cinematography award at the BAFTA Awards. Additionally, Deakins received multiple accolades from other organizations, including the American Society of Cinematographers, the Boston Society of Film Critics, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Online, the Society Film Critics Online, and the Satellite Awards, among others.

<text>St. John&#x27;s University is a private Catholic university in Queens, New York City, United States. It was founded in 1870 by the Congregation of the Mission (C.M., the Vincentian Fathers) with a mission to provide the youth of New York with a Catholic university education. Originally located in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the flagship campus was moved to its current location in the Queens borough during the 1950s. St. John&#x27;s has an additional New York City campus in Manhattan. The university&#x27;s Staten Island campus closed in May of 2024. Additionally, the university has international campuses located in Rome, Italy; Paris, France; and Limerick, Ireland. 

St. John&#x27;s is organized into five undergraduate schools and six graduate schools offering more than 100 bachelor, master, and doctoral degree programs as well as professional certificates. In 2019, the university had 17,088 undergraduate and 4,633 graduate students. The student body represents 46 states, District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and 119 countries. As of 2020, St. John&#x27;s alumni total more than 190,000 worldwide.

==History==

===Foundations===
St. John&#x27;s University was founded in 1870, by the Vincentian Fathers of the Catholic Church in response to an invitation by the first Bishop of Brooklyn, John Loughlin, to provide the youth of the city with a Catholic intellectual and moral education. Originally established as the College of St. John the Baptist, the first campus was located at 75 Lewis Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Ground was broken for St. John&#x27;s College Hall, the university&#x27;s first building, on May 28, 1868. The cornerstone was laid on July 25, 1869. It opened for educational purposes on September 5, 1870.

===Founding principles===

St. John&#x27;s Vincentian values stem from the ideals and works of St Vincent de Paul, who is the patron saint of Christian charity. Following the Vincentian tradition, the university seeks to provide an education that encourages greater involvement in social justice, charity, and service. The Vincentian Center for Church and Society, located on the university&#x27;s Queens campus serves as &quot;a clearinghouse for and developer of Vincentian information, poverty research, social justice resources, and as an academic/cultural programming center&quot;.

The St. John&#x27;s University Seal bears one phrase in Latin and one in Greek. The Latin phrases &quot;Sigillum Universitatis Sti Joannis Neo Eboraci&quot; translates in English to &quot;Seal of St. John&#x27;s University, New York&quot;. The Greek phrase translates to &quot;A lamp, burning, and shining&quot;, a reference to the way Jesus describes St. John the Baptist in John 5:35. The University Crest bears the Latin phrase &quot;Educatio Christiana Animae Perfectio&quot;, which translates to &quot;A Christian education perfects the soul&quot;.

As a Catholic school run by the Vincentians, clergy can be found in positions within the administration, faculty, and spiritual staff. Crosses adorn many rooms and buildings throughout the campus and the university maintains close ties to the Catholic Church.

===Growth===
Beginning with the law school in 1925, St. John&#x27;s began establishing other graduate and undergraduate schools, and became a university in 1933. In April 1936, St. John&#x27;s bought the Hillcrest Golf Club&#x27;s of land for about $500,000, with the intention of eventually moving the school to the new site. Under the terms of the sale, the golf club continued to operate on the site for a few years. On February 11, 1954, St. John&#x27;s officially broke ground on a new campus in Hillcrest, Queens, on the former site of the Hillcrest Golf Club. During the official groundbreaking ceremony, the shovel used was the same shovel that had broken ground on the original campus in 1868. The following year, the original school of the university, St. John&#x27;s College, moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant to the new campus. (The old campus would change ownership over the years and remains extant but has been converted to residential use.)
Over approximately the next two decades, the other schools of the university, which were located at a separate campus at 96 Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn, moved out to the new campus in Queens. The last of the schools to relocate to Queens moved there in 1972, bringing an end to the Downtown Brooklyn campus of the university. In 1959, the university established a Freedom Institute to provide lectures and programs that would, in the words of university president John A. Flynn, focus &quot;attention on the dangers of communism threatening free institutions here and abroad,&quot; with Arpad F. Kovacs of the St. John&#x27;s history department as its director. (A volume of lectures given at the Freedom Institute was edited by Kovacs and published in 1961 as &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot;.) The university also hired the noted historian Paul Kwan-Tsien Sih to establish an Institute of Asian Studies in that same year, and similarly set up a Center for African Studies under the directorship of the economic geographer Hugh C. Brooks. 

The university received praise from &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in 1962 for being a Catholic university that accepted Jews with low household income. &quot;Time&quot; also ranked St. John&#x27;s as &quot;good−small&quot; on a list of the nation&#x27;s Catholic universities in 1962.

On January 27, 1971, the New York State Board of Regents approved the consolidation of the university with the former Notre Dame College (New York), a private women&#x27;s college, and the Staten Island campus of St. John&#x27;s University became a reality. Classes began in the fall of 1971, combining the original Notre Dame College with the former Brooklyn campus of St. John&#x27;s, offering undergraduate degrees in liberal arts, business and education. The Grymes Hill campus on Staten Island was closed in 2024.

===Further expansion (1999–present)===

Circa 1989, according to Steve Fishman of &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, &quot;St. John&#x27;s was essentially a commuter school&quot; but that changed after Father Donald Harrington became the president of the university that year, replacing Father Joseph Cahill. Under Harrington the school increased its infrastructure and international profile. By 1990 the tuition and fees at St. John&#x27;s was less than half of that at schools like NYU and Columbia. Moreover, in 1999, the university completed the first residence halls on the main Queens campus, making it easier for out-of-state and international students to attend the flagship campus. The university is now entering a new chapter under the leadership of Brian Shanley. Shanley is the former president of Providence College and is credited in bringing much growth to the college.

Beginning in 1995, the university began a series of acquisitions lasting for the following 22 years and establishing new locations throughout New York and the world.
*&quot;Rome Campus&quot;. In 1995 St. John&#x27;s establishes its first international campus in Rome, Italy. The campus offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.
*&quot;Manhattan Campus&quot;. St. John&#x27;s acquired The College of Insurance in Manhattan, in 2001. The school was converted to the School of Risk Management and added several programs to the St. John&#x27;s academic portfolio, including Actuarial Science. The campus also included additional dormitories in downtown Manhattan.
*&quot;Paris Location&quot;. In 2008 the university established a location in Paris, France, with residential accommodations and multiple programs. The locations purpose allowing students to complete a portion of their studies under St. John&#x27;s faculty in France while being exposed to the cultural offerings of the city.

===Other notable events===
The St. John&#x27;s University strike of 1966–1967 was a protest by faculty at the university which began on January 4, 1966, and ended in June 1967. The strike began after 31 faculty members were dismissed in the fall of 1965 without due process, dismissals which some felt were a violation of the professors&#x27; academic freedom. The strike ended without any reinstatements, but led to the widespread unionization of public college faculty in the New York City area. In 1970 arbitrators ruled that the university had not acted improperly.

In 2010 federal prosecutors arrested Cecilia Chang, dean of the school&#x27;s Institute of Asian Studies, and charged her with embezzling money from the university, bribing students with scholarships in exchange for forced labor, tax evasion, and false statements to federal agents. Chang, a graduate-school alumna from Taiwan who naturalized in 1989, began directing the Asian Center and acted as a fundraiser in 1977. On Monday, November 5, 2012, she testified in her own trial and committed suicide at age 59 the next day. Anne Hendershot of &quot;Crisis Magazine&quot; wrote that the information revealed that described Chang giving material benefits to other members of the administration was &quot;even more damaging to the reputation of St. John&#x27;s University.&quot;

==Organization and administration==
St. John&#x27;s University is a Catholic non-profit organization controlled by privately appointed board of trustees which is chosen by the Vincentian order. Brian J. Shanley is the 18th and current president of the university, and Aidan R. Rooney is the executive vice president.

Per the university&#x27;s statutes, presidents must be priests from the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians). The trustees waived this requirement due to the limited number of candidates. In 2014, Conrado Gempesaw, became the first ever lay person to be appointed President of St. John&#x27;s University and in 2021, Brian Shanley became the first non-Vincentian Catholic priest appointed president. Shanley is a member of the Dominican Order.

===Campus renovations===
In 2008, St. John&#x27;s University broke ground for the new University Center/Academic Building, one of the largest and most comprehensive construction projects in St. John&#x27;s recent history. Located between Sullivan Hall and the Taffner Field House on the site that currently serves as stadium seating for lacrosse and track and field events, the 110,000 square feet (10,000 m2) complex contains 14 classrooms with approximately 800 seats. In addition, it includes a café, lounge, recreation and entertainment spaces, student organization offices and conference and meeting rooms devoted exclusively to student use. The building is named &quot;The D&#x27;Angelo Center&quot; after board of trustees member Peter D&#x27;Angelo &#x27;78 MBA, and his wife Peg D&#x27;Angelo &#x27;70 Ed.

In 2005, St. John&#x27;s constructed Taffner Field house, and dramatically renovated Carnesecca Arena (formerly Alumni Hall) and the University Center. Renovations to Carnesecca Hall included a . Health Center, for use by Student Life and athletics, including weight training equipment, aerobic and dance studios, and a student lounge. The University Center renovations consisted of reconfigured office and meeting space for Student Life and academic clubs, and the addition of audio/visual rooms for all varsity athletic teams. Taffner Athletic Field House was $23 million initiative. The two-story, . structure adjacent to Carnesecca Hall includes four basketball courts, academic classrooms and locker rooms.

In 2005, the science labs and student life facilities were the target of an additional $60 million in capital enhancements. In regards to its expansion plans, the university has had a contentious relationship with the surrounding community in the past. In 2007, however, it was discovered that the university was planning to lease a building under construction by a separate company for an off-campus dormitory. Residents argue that such a plan goes against the school&#x27;s pledge of being a &quot;good neighbor&quot; towards the community. The university, however, contends that it did not break the pledge for it was only leasing the structure not building it. Nevertheless, opponents, including state Senator Frank Padavan, argue that such an explanation is &quot;disingenuous&quot;. St. Vincent Hall was also converted from a Vincentian and clergy residence to student dormitories. The Vincentian fathers and other clergy moved to the Father John Murray Hall built for them on campus were they now live.

The university has seen much growth on its campuses in order to attract students from outside the New York area. In 1999, the first dormitory was completed on the Queens campus. As of 2008, the campus now contains seven dorms and a townhouse complex.

Prior to 1994, St. John&#x27;s went by the nickname &quot;Redmen&quot;, which referenced the red uniforms worn by the university in competition.

The stadium is one of the largest college baseball stadiums in the northeast, and is a featured venue on the EA Sports MVP NCAA Baseball video game. The stadium had been conceived out of a deal between the university and the Giuliani Administration, wherein the latter wanted to find a location for a single-A team that would be affiliated with the New York Mets. Expressing concern about quality of life issues and the spending of public money for a private religious institution, surrounding neighborhood civic groups and local politicians protested the plan. In order to placate their concerns, the Mets offered to open it up to the communities for local high school games and youth programs, and the stadium was built amid many large-scale protests by community residents and by State Senator Frank Padavan, while also using city financing. The Red Storm played the first-ever game at the Mets&#x27; new ballpark, Citi Field, on March 29, 2009.

<doc id="241060" wikidata="Q1528836" url="?curid=241060" title="Society of Saint Vincent de Paul">
<text>The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul (SVP or SVdP or SSVP) is an international voluntary organization in the Catholic Church, founded in 1833 for the sanctification of its members by personal service of the poor. Started by Frédéric Ozanam and Emmanuel-Joseph Bailly de Surcy and named after Vincent de Paul, the organization is part of the global Vincentian Family of Catholic organizations. 

Innumerable Catholic parishes have established &quot;conferences&quot;, most of which affiliate with a diocesan council. Among its varied efforts to offer material help to the poor or needy, the Society also has thrift stores which sell donated goods at a low price and raise money for the poor. There are a great variety of outreach programs sponsored by the local conferences and councils, addressing local needs for social services.

== France ==
The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in 1833 to help impoverished people living in the slums of Paris, France. The primary figure behind the Society&#x27;s founding was Blessed Frédéric Ozanam, a French lawyer, author, and professor in the Sorbonne. Frédéric collaborated with Emmanuel Bailly, editor of the &quot;Tribune Catholique&quot;, in reviving a student organization which had been suspended during the revolutionary activity of July 1830. Ozanam was 20 years old when he founded the Society. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1997. Emmanuel Bailly was chosen as the first President.

The Society took Saint Vincent de Paul as its patron under the influence of Sister Rosalie Rendu, DC. Sister Rosalie, beatified in November 1999 by Pope John Paul II, was a member of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, earlier known for her work with people in the slums of Paris. She guided Frédéric and his companions in their approach towards those in need.
SVP gradually expanded outside Paris in the mid-19th century and received benefactors in places such as Tours where figures such as the Venerable Leo Dupont, known as the Holy Man of Tours, became collaborators.

The Society is part of the Vincentian Family which also includes two congregations founded by St. Vincent de Paul – the Congregation of the Mission with Vincentian priests and brothers and the Ladies of Charity – along with the Sisters of Charity in the Setonian tradition and several others, including some religious groups that are part of the Anglican Communion like the Company of Mission Priests.

== England and Wales ==
Servant of God Fr. Ignatius Spencer from London came to know the Society in visits to Paris. Parisian Monsieur Baudon, who would assume the presidency of SVDP in 1847, visited London in 1842 and persuaded Spencer to write about the Society in the &quot;Catholic Magazine&quot;. Then in January 1844 M. Pagliano, a London restaurateur and recent convert to Catholicism, gathered 13 Catholic men and the first English SVP conference was founded. Early initiatives included the formation of the Catholic Shoe Black Brigade, providing boys with gainful employment and the first home of &quot;the Rescue Society&quot; which under various names still offers child care in many dioceses.

In 2013 there were more than 10,000 members in more than 1,000 Conferences in the United Kingdom, making over 500,000 recorded visits annually to more than 100,000 people.

== United States ==

The Society&#x27;s first Conference in the United States was established in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, at the Basilica of St. Louis King of France, or &quot;Old Cathedral&quot;. Fr. John Timon, CM, had learned of the Society while visiting with his Vincentian superiors in Paris. From Dublin, Ireland, he brought to St. Louis copies of the SVP Rule. On 16 November 1845, Bishop Peter Richard Kenrick dedicated the new St. Vincent de Paul church on South Eighth Street and invited Timon to preach. Timon discussed the Society in his sermon, in the presence of prominent laymen who took hold of the idea and held an organizational meeting on 20 November 1845. The Conference included Moses Linton, founder of the &quot;St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal,&quot; and as chair Judge Bryan Mullanphy who would become mayor of St. Louis. Bishop Kenrick appointed Fr. Ambrose Heim as spiritual advisor to the Conference.

== Australia ==
Gerald Ward was born in London in 1806 and was recruited for the Melbourne mission by the pioneering father, later bishop, Patrick Geoghegan. Ward was familiar with SVP from London and, observing the plight of the poor after the Victorian gold rush, established the Society in Australia in 1854. Ward served as its first president and helped establish the SVP orphanage in South Melbourne.

In March 2023, Mark Gaetani was officially inducted as the 18th National Council President by Archbishop Christopher Prowse at St. Christopher&#x27;s Cathedral, Manuka in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, taking over from Claire Victory.

== New Zealand ==
Fr. Chataigner, SM, established the first Conference in New Zealand in July 1867, but did not affiliate with the Council-General in Paris. The first to affiliate was the Wellington Conference founded in 1908 by Fr. Petitjean, SM, and Charles O&#x27;Neill, followed by other Conferences out of Wellington.

== Scotland ==
Charles O&#x27;Neill was born in Glasgow in 1828. He graduated as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Upon graduation he had joined the Society of St Vincent de Paul. He was secretary at Dumbarton in 1851. He led the St Vincent de Paul Society in the Western Districts of Scotland between 1859 and 1863. By 1863 he was president of the Superior Council of Glasgow and a member of the Council-General in Paris.

== India ==
The Society was first introduced in India by the French Missionaries at Pondicherry during the Year 1852-53 as a non-aggregated Conference. The Society was officially started in India in 1863 when some conferences in Bombay were aggregated and the Bombay Particular Council was instituted. Then onwards the Society continued to grow in India. On 09.11.1953 the Superior Council of India was established and instituted with the Council General International. The Superior Council of India was renamed as National Council of India on 06.08.1973. The National Council of India has its Headquarters in Mumbai and the present President’s secretariat is at Chennai, Tamil Nadu with the election of Bro. S. Jude ZR Mangalraj as the 14th National President of India with effect from 28th February 2021.

The National Council of India is registered under the Income Tax Act 1961 with exemption under Sec 80G, FCRA under the ministry of Home Affairs and Societies Regn. Act and Bombay Public Trust Act 1950.

== Today ==
The Society numbers about 800,000 members in some 140 countries worldwide, whose members operate through &quot;conferences&quot;. A Conference may be based out of a church, school, community center, hospital, etc., and is composed of Catholic volunteers who pursue their own Christian growth in the service of the poor. Some Conferences exist without affiliating with any local Council, and so are not counted in statistics. Non-Catholics may join and the Society serves all regardless of their personal beliefs.

=== Ireland ===
The Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in Dublin on 16 December 1844. It is now the largest voluntary charitable organisation in Ireland, making it one of Ireland&#x27;s best known and most widely supported organisations of social concern and action. It has over 11,500 volunteers, active in every county in Ireland. During its history it has helped people in need through a famine, a civil war, a war of independence, two world wars, and several economic recessions.

===Australia===
In Australia, &quot;Vinnies&quot; workers and volunteers number about 58,000. Works include Conferences, Special Works, and Vinnies op shops, assisting over 2,200,000 people in Australia each year.

In 1996, Ozcare was established as a special work of the society. It provides aged care and disability centres and services.

In 2018, the St Vincent de Paul Society Queensland was named as one of the Queensland Greats by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in a ceremony at the Queensland Art Gallery on 8 June 2018.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, SVP operates in 23 regions with over 50 shops which serve as centres for welfare service, including food banks and food trucks. Most Catholic schools have Young Vinnies who help with fundraising and with training for dealing directly with the poor. The work is varied, following the Vinnie motto: &quot;No act of charity is foreign to the society.&quot;

===United States===
The national headquarters is in St. Louis. Membership in the United States in 2015 exceeded 97,000 in 4,400 communities. Expenditures to people in poverty were $473,821,563. Programs include visits to homes, prisons, and hospitals, housing assistance, disaster relief, job training and placement, food pantries, dining halls, clothing, transportation and utility costs, care for the elderly, and medicine. Revenue is raised through a large network of thrift stores.

One of the working companies is &quot;Aurora Glass Foundry&quot; that recycles scrap glass and turns it into various decorative glass products for sale.

===Monaco===

The first Conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in Monaco was created in 1876.
The Conference of the immaculate Conception of Monaco-City whose commemorative plaque is on the Place de la Visitation, thanks among others to Monsieur Thheuret, Apostolic Protonotary in Monaco and to Mr Gastaldi, Mayor of Monaco. Mr. Theuret was appointed first Honorary President. The Vice-President of Honor being the Marquis de la Riva, first Chambellan of the Sovereign Prince.

The first active President was Lieutenant Plati. The Sovereign Prince, Prince Charles III, was one of the first benefactors. At the time, the Immaculate Conception Conference was attached to the Particular Council of the Nice Conferences.

<text>1,4-Dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB, p-DCB, or para-dichlorobenzene, sometimes abbreviated as PDCB or para) is an aryl chloride and isomer of dichlorobenzene with the formula C6H4Cl2. This colorless solid has a strong odor. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with two chlorine atoms (replacing hydrogen atoms) on opposing sites of the ring.

It is used as a disinfectant, pesticide, and deodorant, most familiarly in mothballs in which it is a replacement for the more traditional naphthalene because of naphthalene&#x27;s greater flammability (though both chemicals have the same NFPA 704 rating). It is also used as a precursor in the production of the chemically and thermally resistant polymer poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene sulfide).

== Production ==
&quot;p&quot;-DCB is produced by chlorination of benzene using ferric chloride as a catalyst:
:C6H6 + 2 Cl2 → C6H4Cl2 + 2 HCl
The chief impurity is the 1,2 isomer. The compound can be purified by fractional crystallization, taking advantage of its relatively high melting point of 53.5 °C; the isomeric dichlorobenzenes and chlorobenzene melt well below room temperature.

== Uses ==
=== Disinfectant, deodorant, and pesticide===
&quot;p&quot;-DCB is used to control moths, molds, and mildew. It also finds use as a disinfectant in waste containers and restrooms and is the characteristic smell associated with urinal cakes. Its usefulness for these applications arises from &quot;p&quot;-DCB&#x27;s low solubility in water and its relatively high volatility: it sublimes readily near room temperature.

=== Precursor to other chemicals ===
Nitration gives 1,4-dichloronitrobenzene, a precursor to commercial dyes and pigments. The chloride sites on &quot;p&quot;-DCB can be substituted with hydroxylamine and sulfide groups. In a growing application, &quot;p&quot;-DCB is the precursor to the high performance polymer poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene sulfide):

== Environmental and health effects ==
&quot;p&quot;-DCB is poorly soluble in water and is not easily broken down by soil organisms. Like many hydrocarbons, &quot;p&quot;-DCB is lipophilic and will accumulate in fatty tissues if consumed by a person or animal.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have determined that &quot;p&quot;-DCB may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen. This has been indicated by animal studies, although a full-scale human study has not been done.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set a target maximum contaminant level of 75 micrograms of &quot;p&quot;-DCB per liter of drinking water (75 μg/L), but publishes no information on the cancer risk. &quot;p&quot;-DCB is also an EPA-registered pesticide. The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a maximum level of 75 parts of &quot;p&quot;-DCB per million parts air in the workplace (75 ppm) for an 8-hour day, 40-hour workweek.

A mechanism for the carcinogenic effects of mothballs and some types of air fresheners containing &quot;p&quot;-DCB has been identified in roundworms.

Due to its carcinogenic nature, use of paradichlorobenzene in the European Union is forbidden as an air freshener (since 2005) and in mothballs (since 2008).

=== Biodegradation ===
&quot;Rhodococcus phenolicus&quot; is a bacterium species able to degrade dichlorobenzene as its sole carbon source.
