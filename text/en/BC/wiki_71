<text>The Africa Cup of Nations, commonly abbreviated as AFCON and officially known as the [[TotalEnergies]] Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship reasons, is the main biennial international men&#x27;s association football competition in Africa. It is sanctioned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and was first held in 1957. Since 1968, it has been held every two years, switching to odd-numbered years in 2013.

In the first tournament in 1957, there were only three participating nations: Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. South Africa who were originally scheduled to join, but all were disqualified due to the apartheid policies of the government then in power. Since then, the tournament has expanded greatly, making it necessary to hold a qualifying tournament. The number of participants in the final tournament reached 16 in 1998 (16 teams were to compete in 1996, but Nigeria withdrew, reducing the field to 15, and the same happened with Togo&#x27;s withdrawal in 2010), and until 2017, the format had been unchanged, with the 16 teams being drawn into four groups of four teams each, with the top two teams of each group advancing to a &quot;knock-out&quot; stage. On 20 July 2017, the 2019 edition of the tournament was moved from January to June and all future tournaments were expanded from 16 to 24 teams.

Egypt is the most successful nation in the cup&#x27;s history, winning the tournament seven times, with Cameroon winning five times and Ghana four times. Three trophies have been awarded during the tournament&#x27;s history; the current trophy was first awarded in 2002. Egypt won an unprecedented three consecutive titles in 2006, 2008, and 2010. In 2013, the tournament format was switched to being held in odd-numbered years so as not to interfere with the FIFA World Cup. Ivory Coast are the tournament&#x27;s current champions, having beaten Nigeria 2–1 in the 2023 final. Speaking of the tournament&#x27;s current champions; In 2005, the Ivory Coast national team, captained by Didier Drogba, played a vital role in helping to end a devastating civil war in their country. After qualifying for the World Cup for the first time, Drogba made an emotional plea for peace, which was broadcast nationwide and ultimately contributed to a cease-fire. 

==History==

===1950s–60s: Origin and early years===

The origin of the African Nations Cup dates from June 1956, when the creation of the Confederation of African Football was proposed during the third FIFA congress in Lisbon. There were immediate plans for a continental tournament to be held and, in February 1957, the first Africa Cup of Nations was held in Khartoum, Sudan. There was no qualification for this tournament, the field being made up of the four founding nations of CAF (Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and South Africa). South Africa&#x27;s insistence on selecting only white players for its squad due to its apartheid policy led to its disqualification, and as a consequence Ethiopia were handed a bye straight to the final. Hence only two matches were played, with Egypt being crowned as the first continental champion after defeating hosts Sudan in the semi-final by 2–1 and Ethiopia in the final by a score of 4–0.

Two years later in 1959, Egypt hosted the second ANC in Cairo with the participation of the same three teams. Host and defending champions Egypt again won, after defeating Sudan in the final by a score of 2–1 . The field grew to include nine teams for the third ANC in 1962 in Addis Ababa, and for the first time there was a qualification round to determine which four teams would play for the title. Host Ethiopia and reigning champion Egypt received automatic berths and were joined in the final four by Nigeria and Tunisia. Egypt made its third consecutive final appearance, but the Ethiopia team emerged as victors, first beating Tunisia and then downing Egypt in extra time.

===1960s: Ghanaian domination===
In 1963, Ghana made its first appearance as it hosted the event and won the title after beating Sudan in the final. They repeated that as they became champions two years later in Tunisia—equalling Egypt as two-time winners—with a squad that included only two returning members from the 1963 team. In 1965, the CAF introduced a rule that limited the number of overseas players in each team to two. The rule persisted until 1982.

The 1968, competition&#x27;s final tournament format expanded to include eight of the 22 teams entered in the preliminary rounds. The qualifying teams were distributed in two groups of four to play single round-robin tournaments, with the top two teams of each group advancing to semi-finals, a system that remained in use for the finals until 1992. The Democratic Republic of Congo won its first title, beating Ghana in the final. Starting with the 1968 tournament, the competition was regularly held every two years in even-numbered years; this ended with the 2012 tournament, which was followed by a tournament in 2013, and successor editions in each odd-numbered year. Ivory Coast forward Laurent Pokou led the 1968 and 1970 tournaments in scoring, with six and eight goals respectively, and his total of 14 goals remained the all-time record until 2008. Play was covered for television for the first time during the 1970 tournament in Sudan, as the hosts lifted the trophy after defeating Ghana – who were playing their fourth consecutive final.

===1970s: A decade of champions===

Six nations won titles from 1970 to 1980: Sudan, Congo-Brazzaville, Zaire, Morocco, Ghana, and Nigeria. Zaire&#x27;s second title in the 1974 edition (it won its first as the Democratic Republic of Congo) came after facing Zambia in the final.

For the only time to date in the history of the competition, the match had to be replayed as the first contest between the two sides ended in a 2–2 draw after extra time. The final was re-staged two days later with Zaire winning 2–0. Forward Mulamba Ndaye scored all four of Zaire&#x27;s goals in these two matches: he was also the top scorer of the tournament with nine goals, setting a single-tournament record that remains unmatched. Three months earlier, Zaire had become the first Sub-Saharan African nation to qualify to the FIFA World Cup. Morocco won their first title in the 1976 ANC held in Ethiopia and Ghana took its third championship in 1978, becoming the first nation to win three titles.

===1980s: Cameroonian domination===
Between 1980 and 1990, Cameroon managed to reach the final of the Africa Cup three times in a row, winning the competition twice in 1984 and 1988 and losing once on penalties against Egypt in the 1986 edition, the other dominant team during this period was Algeria, along with their solid 1982 and decent 1986 World Cup appearances, the North African nation lost in the final against hosts Nigeria in the 1980 tournament allowing the Super Eagles to capture their first championship. After the 1980 edition, Algeria reached the semi-finals of every edition except the 1986 cup until they eventually won the competition in 1990. Ghana&#x27;s fourth continental title came in the 1982 cup tournament, where they beat host Libya in the final. The match ended in a 1–1 draw after 120 minutes and Ghana national football team won the penalty shootout to become champions.

===1990s: The return of South Africa===
In 1990, the 1990 African Cup of Nations was the 17th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa (CAF). It was hosted by Algeria. Just like in 1988, the field of eight teams was split into two groups of four. Algeria won its first championship, beating Nigeria in the final 1–0. Nigeria lost once again as they made their third final appearance in four tournaments, this time falling to host Algeria.

The 1992 Cup of Nations expanded the number of final tournament participants to 12; the teams were divided into four groups of three, with the top two teams of each group advancing to quarter-finals. Ghanaian midfielder Abedi &quot;Pele&quot; Ayew, who scored three goals, was named the best player of the tournament after his contributions helped Ghana reach the final; he was, however, suspended for that match and Ghana lost to Ivory Coast in a penalty shootout that saw each side make 11 attempts to determine the winner. Ivory Coast set a record for the competition by holding each of their opponents scoreless in the six matches of the final tournament.

The 12-team, three-group format was used again two years later, where hosts Tunisia were humiliated by their first-round elimination. Nigeria, who had just qualified to the World Cup for the first time in their history, won the tournament, beating Zambia, who a year before had been struck by disaster when most of their national squad died in a plane crash while traveling to play a 1994 World Cup qualification match. Nigerian forward Rashidi Yekini, who had led the 1992 tournament with four goals, repeated as the top scorer with five goals.

South Africa hosted the 20th ACN competition in 1996, marking its first ever appearance after a decades-long ban was lifted with the end of apartheid in the country, which had been followed by a failed attempt to qualify in 1994. The number of final-round participants in 1996 was expanded to 16, split into four groups. However, the actual number of teams playing in the final was only 15, because Nigeria withdrew from the tournament at the final moment for political reasons. &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; won their first title on home soil, defeating Tunisia in the final.

The South Africans would reach the final again two years later in Burkina Faso, but were unable to defend their title, losing to Egypt who claimed their fourth cup.

===2000s: Egypt&#x27;s unprecedented treble===

The 2000 edition was hosted jointly by Ghana and Nigeria, who replaced the originally designated host Zimbabwe. Following a 2–2 draw after extra time in the final, Cameroon defeated Nigeria on penalty kicks. In 2002, Cameroon&#x27;s &quot;Indomitable Lions&quot; won their second consecutive title. This was the first repeat since Ghana had done it in the 1960s and after Egypt had done it before in 1957 and 1959. The Cameroonians beat first-time finalists Senegal, who also debuted in the World Cup later that year, via penalty kicks. Both finalists were eliminated in the quarter-finals two years later in Tunisia, where the hosts won their first title, beating Morocco 2–1 in the final.

The 2006 tournament was also won by the hosts, Egypt, who reached a continental-record fifth title. Ahead of the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations several European clubs called for a rethink of the tournament&#x27;s schedule. Given that it takes place during the European season, players who are involved miss several matches for their clubs. In January 2008, FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced that he wanted the tournament to be held in either June or July by 2016, to fit in the international calendar, although this would preclude many countries in central and west Africa from hosting the competition (for these months occur during their wet season). The 2008 tournament was hosted by Ghana, and saw Egypt retain the trophy, winning its record-extending sixth tournament by defeating Cameroon 1–0 in the final.

=== 2010s: Switch to odd years ===
Egypt set a new record in the 2010 tournament (hosted by Angola) by winning its third consecutive title in an unprecedented achievement on the African level after defeating Ghana 1–0 in the final, retaining the gold-plated cup indefinitely and extending its record to seven continental titles (including when Egypt was known as UAR between 1958 and 1961). Egypt became the first African nation to win three consecutive cups and joined Mexico, Argentina, and Iran who also won their continent cup three times in a row. On 31 January 2010, Egypt set a new African record, not being defeated for 19 consecutive Cup of Nations matches, since a 2–1 loss against Algeria in Tunisia in 2004, and a record 9 consecutive win streak. In May 2010, it was announced that the tournament would be moved to odd-numbered years from 2013 in order to prevent the tournament from taking place in the same year as the World Cup. It also meant there were two tournaments within twelve months in January 2012 (co-hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea) and January 2013 (hosted by South Africa). The change of FIFA Confederations Cup from a biennial to a quadrennial tournament, and the switching of the Africa Cup of Nations from even to odd-number years, meant that some previous Africa Cup of Nations champions such as Egypt, Zambia, and Ivory Coast (winners of the 2010, 2012, and 2015 tournaments respectively) were deprived from participating in the Confederations Cup tournament.In 2011, Morocco won the bid to host the 2015 edition, and Libya won the right to host the 2013 tournament, but the 2011 Libyan civil war prompted Libya and South Africa to trade years, with South Africa hosting in 2013 and Libya hosting in 2017. Ongoing fighting in Libya ultimately prompted CAF to move the 2017 tournament to Gabon). In 2012, Zambia won the final after a penalty shootout against Ivory Coast. This drew increased media attention since the match took place in Gabon, only a few hundred meters from the crash site of the 1993 air disaster of their national team. The 2013 tournament was won by Nigeria, beating first time finalists Burkina Faso. In 2014–15, the West African Ebola virus epidemic disrupted the tournament. All football activities in Liberia were suspended, and the Antoinette Tubman Stadium in Monrovia was converted into an Ebola treatment unit. The 2015 Africa Cup of Nations was scheduled to be held in Morocco, but they refused to hold the tournament on the allotted dates due to concerns of the Ebola outbreak, so it was moved to Equatorial Guinea. In July 2016, Total secured the rights to an eight-year sponsorship package to support 10 of CAF&#x27;s principal competitions. This began with the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon which was renamed the &quot;Total Africa Cup of Nations&quot;.

=== Since 2019: Tournament expansion ===
Under Ahmad Ahmad&#x27;s presidency, there were discussions regarding further changes to the Africa Cup of Nations. In July 2017, two changes were proposed: switching the timing of the competition from January to the Northern Hemisphere summer and expanding from 16 to 24 teams (effective from the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations). On 20 July 2017, the CAF Executive Commission approved the propositions at a meeting in Rabat, Morocco. 

Algeria won the African Cup of Nations 2019, achieving a 1–0 victory against Senegal in the final. The title was Algeria&#x27;s second ever and first since 1990. Nigeria came third after beating Tunisia 1–0 in their third-place decider match. The prize money awarded to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations winner amounted to $4.5 million while runners-up Senegal got $2.5 million.

Match days 3 and 4 of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, which was slated from 25 to 30 March 2020, were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations tournament, hosted by Cameroon, and was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Confederation of African Football increased the cash prize for the winner from $4.5 million to $5 million for 2021 Africa Cup of Nations while the second-best team will get $2.75 million. Senegal won the tournament for the first time after beating Egypt on penalties in the final.

== Format ==
The number of teams and the format of each final tournament have varied over the years. In most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.

Since the 1962 edition, this competition has been held in two phases: a qualification phase (or called the elimination phase) and a final tournament. The host country of the final tournament is automatically qualified, and in the first editions the defending champion was also qualified for the following tournament.

=== Qualifying ===

The qualification phase has evolved over time according to the increasing number of nations affiliated to the Confederation of African Football (CAF). It was set up from 1962, during the first two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations, the founding nations of the CAF participated in the final tournament, namely Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan (South Africa was excluded just after its foundation due to Apartheid).

In 1962, new nations were affiliated and forced CAF to set up a qualifying phase for the final tournament in the form of knockout matches. This system was used until the 1992 edition, when the organization of the qualifying phase became closer to that of the UEFA European Championship, with qualifying groups of four to seven teams depending on the editions where each selection plays a round-trip opposition against each of its opponents, the qualified country being decided according to its classification within its group.

=== Final phase ===
Only the hosts received an automatic qualification spot, with the other 23 teams qualifying through a qualification tournament. At the finals, the 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams each. The teams in each group played a single round robin.

After the group stage, the top two teams and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16. The winners advanced to the quarter-finals. The winners of the quarter-finals advanced to the semi-finals. The losers of the semi-finals played in a third-place play-off, while winners of the semi-finals played in the final.

==Trophy and medals==
Throughout the history of the Africa Cup of Nations, three trophies have been awarded to the winners of the competition. The original trophy, made of silver, was the Abdelaziz Abdallah Salem Trophy, named after the first CAF president, Egyptian Abdelaziz Abdallah Salem. As the first winner of three Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, Ghana obtained the right to permanently hold the trophy in 1978.

The second trophy was awarded from 1980 to 2000 and was named &quot;Trophy of African Unity&quot; or &quot;African Unity Cup&quot;. It was given to CAF by the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa prior to the 1980 tournament and it was a cylindrical piece with the Olympic rings over a map of the continent engraved on it. It sat on a squared base and had stylized triangular handles. Cameroon won the Unity Cup indefinitely after they became three-time champions in 2000.

In 2001, the third trophy was revealed, a gold-plated cup designed and made in Italy. Cameroon, permanent holders of the previous trophy, were the first nation to be awarded the new trophy after they won the 2002 edition. Egypt won the gold-plated cup indefinitely after they became three-time champions in 2010. Unlike previous winners who would have then taken the trophy home, Egypt was presented with a special full-size replica that they were allowed to keep. The winner of each edition receives a replica whose dimensions are equal to that of the original trophy.

CAF give 30 gold medals to the winning team, 30 silver medals to the runners-up, 30 bronze medals to the team ranked third and 30 diplomas to the team ranked fourth in the final tournament.

<text>Jacques Clément (1567 – 1 August 1589) was a French conspirator and the regicide of King Henry III.

==Early life==
He was born at Serbonnes, in today&#x27;s Yonne &quot;département&quot;, in Burgundy, and became a lay brother of the Third Order of Saint Dominic.

During the French Wars of Religion, Clément became an ardent partisan of the Catholic League. The League&#x27;s determination to prevent regime change efforts by adherents of Protestantism was inspired by the writings of the English Catholic refugee Richard Verstegan, who published accounts in Antwerp of the recent suffering of English, Welsh, and Irish Catholic Martyrs under the Protestant monarchy of Elizabeth I of England. 

The League accordingly viewed Protestantism as a dangerous heresy that must be destroyed to prevent a similar religious persecution of the Catholic Church in France. Clément, as a League supporter, often talked, as was advocated by the Catholic League, of the necessity for a war of extermination against the Huguenots. Clément accordingly opposed the King&#x27;s beliefs, as a , that only a strong and centralised, yet religiously tolerant monarchy with monopoly on political and military power could save France from continued Wars of Religion or even from another Hundred Years War. In retaliation for the recent targeted killings of the Catholic League&#x27;s leaders; Duke of Guise and his brother, Cardinal de Guise, Clément eventually formed a plan for a decapitation strike of the French government by assassinating Henry III. His ideas were approved by some of the heads of the League, in particular, by the late Duke and Cardinal&#x27;s sister, Catherine de Guise, Duchess Montpensier. Clément was promised worldly rewards if he survived and eternal bliss for committing tyrannicide if he fell. Having received confidential letters for the king, he left Paris on 31 July 1589 and reached Saint-Cloud, the headquarters of Henry, who was besieging Paris, on 1 August 1589.

==Assassination==
Clément was admitted to the king&#x27;s presence, and while he was presenting his letters he told the king he had an important and highly confidential message to deliver. The attendants then withdrew and, as Clément leaned in to whisper in Henry&#x27;s ear, he mortally wounded him with a dagger concealed beneath his cloak. The assassin was immediately killed by the returning attendants, but Henry III, after pleading with Navarre that his own conversion to Catholicism was the only way to save the Kingdom from protracted civil war, died early in the morning of the following day. Clément&#x27;s body was posthumously quartered and burned at the stake. 

Although traditionally seen by both Protestant and Royalist as a brutal act motivated by religious fanaticism, the regicide was viewed with very different feelings by the nobles and commons of Paris, who had expelled the King during the recent Day of the Barricades, and by the many partisans of the League. Catherine de Guise, Duchess Montpensier, who had sanctioned Clément&#x27;s plans to avenge the recent assassinations of her brothers, is said to have been particularly overjoyed and to have immediately boasted of her own role in plotting the regicide.

Clément was even seen in some circles as a martyr and his actions were praised as tyrannicide by Pope Sixtus V, as well as the Jesuit historian and political philosopher Juan de Mariana, S.J. His praise was such that even the possibility of opening his cause for canonization was discussed. On the other side, atheist philosopher Jean Meslier praised Clément as a freedom fighter against the alleged tyranny represented by Henri III&#x27;s determination to transform France from a feudal monarchy with a long history of provincial self-government into a centralised and absolute monarchy. Le Laboureur, however, anagrammatized &quot;Frère Jacques Clément&quot; into &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;enfer qui m&#x27;a créé&quot; (&quot;It is hell that created me&quot;).

<doc id="250683" wikidata="Q157894" url="?curid=250683" title="AFC Asian Cup">
<text>The AFC Asian Cup is the primary association football competition contested by the senior men&#x27;s national teams of the members of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), determining the continental champion of Asia. It is the second-oldest continental football championship in the world after Copa América. The winning team becomes the champions of Asia and until 2015 qualified for the FIFA Confederations Cup.

The Asian Cup was held once every four years from the 1956 AFC Asian Cup in Hong Kong until the 2004 tournament in China. However, since the Summer Olympic Games and the European Football Championship were also scheduled in the same year as the Asian Cup, the AFC decided to move their championship to a less crowded cycle. After 2004, the tournament was next held in 2007, when it was co-hosted by four countries in Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Thereafter, it has again been held every four years.

The Asian Cup has generally been dominated by a small number of top teams. Prominently successful teams include Japan (four times), Iran, Saudi Arabia (three times each), South Korea and Qatar (twice each). The other teams which have achieved success are Australia (2015), Iraq (2007) and Kuwait (1980). Israel won in 1964 but was later expelled and has since joined UEFA.

Australia joined the Asian confederation in 2007 and hosted the Asian Cup finals in 2015, winning the competition in the final against South Korea. From the 2019 tournament forward, the number of teams was expanded from 16 teams to 24 teams, with the qualifying process doubling as part of the FIFA World Cup qualification.

==History==
===Beginning===
A pan-Asian competition was first proposed after the end of World War II, but it was not implemented until the 1950s. Two years after the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) came into being in 1954, the first ever AFC Asian Cup was staged in British Hong Kong with seven of the twelve founding members taking part, making the tournament the second oldest continental competition in the world. The qualifying process involved the hosts plus the winners of the various zones (Central, Eastern and Western). It was only a four-team tournament, a format that also existed for 1960 and 1964. Each sub-confederation already hosts their own biennial championship, each with varying degrees of interest.

South Korea demonstrated its superiority in the early years of the competition as the country won the championship in both 1956 and 1960; this remains as South Korea&#x27;s best achievements in the tournament.

===West Asian domination (1964–1988)===
After Hong Kong and South Korea hosted the two first editions, Israel was chosen as host of the 1964 AFC Asian Cup. Using the same format of the two previous editions, this tournament only had four teams and played in one single group to determine the champions. Israel eventually topped the tournament ahead of India with three wins. The format was updated to five teams in 1968 before it was expanded to six teams in 1972 and 1976.

The tournament became the preserve of Iran who won three consecutive tournaments in 1968, 1972 and 1976, with Iran hosting the former and the latter. Iran remains as the only national team in Asia to have won three consecutive Asian Cups. The 1972 final was notable as it was the first Asian Cup to use the group stage-knockout phase format, which was followed in the subsequent tournaments with some alternation. Israel was expelled from the AFC in 1972 due to the Arab–Israeli conflict.

From 1980 to 1988, the number of teams taking part expanded to ten, but West Asian countries continued their domination in the 1980s with Kuwait becoming the first Arab country to win the championship in 1980 held at home soil, beating South Korea 3–0 in the final. Saudi Arabia, after an initial poor start, began to emerge as the country qualified, then won two consecutive Asian trophies in 1984 and 1988, overcoming both China and South Korea. Both tournaments were Saudi Arabia&#x27;s debuts in any major competitions.

===Japan&#x27;s rise and modernization of Asian Cup (1992–2011)===
Until the 1990s, Japan was mostly a small name in Asian football, and the country only qualified for the 1988 edition, the first time Japan took part in a continental football tournament. However, as Japan started to make a concrete move inroad to professional football, the country&#x27;s fortunes increased. Japan hosted the 1992 AFC Asian Cup, which was reduced to eight teams and two groups, where it emerged victorious after beating Saudi Arabia, then-defending champions, 1–0, to win the country&#x27;s first major international honour.

The 1996 AFC Asian Cup saw the tournament expand to twelve teams in its process of professionalization. Held by the United Arab Emirates, the hosts breached into the final for the first time ever but were unable to win the trophy after losing to Saudi Arabia, who made it into the country&#x27;s fourth consecutive Asian finals, on penalties. It was Saudi Arabia&#x27;s third Asian title.

The 2000 AFC Asian Cup saw Lebanon take part in its first Asian tournament, and it was Saudi Arabia who again reached the final, but this time, Japan triumphed over Saudi Arabia 1–0 in a final filled with a majority of Saudi supporters. Japan would go on to retain their Asian trophy four years later, albeit in a more struggling style and a very heated, politically charged final toward hosts China. The 2004 edition was notable as it expanded to 16 teams, and marked Saudi Arabia&#x27;s absence from an Asian Cup final for the first time.

The 2007 AFC Asian Cup was the debut of Australia, which had abandoned the Oceania Football Confederation in 2006 (coincidentally the first team to qualify for the tournament), as well as being the first football competition in the world to be hosted by more than two nations, with four countries in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia) hosting. In this tournament, Iraq was crowned as Asian champions despite the ravaging American invasion, overpowering the likes of Australia, South Korea and Saudi Arabia in the process.

Australia (which joined the AFC in 2006), after its poor debut in 2007, rebounded to reach the final in 2011 AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, but lost to Japan after extra-time; the win for Japan meant it became the most decorated team in Asian football with four titles. Still, the tournament was notable as the first Asian Cup to use the jersey numbers&#x27; order from 1 to 23, previously not practised in prior competitions.

===Expansion of the Asian Cup (2015–present)===
Following Australia&#x27;s successes in the 2011 Asian Cup, the AFC approved the country to host the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. At the tournament, Australia managed to clamp down every opponent with only one loss, against eventual finalist South Korea, whom Australia would get a 2–1 final revenge after extra-time; the win officially sealed Southeast Asia&#x27;s first Asian title as Australia joined the AFF in 2013. AFC Asian Cup began on 12 January 2024 and ended on 10th February 2024.

At the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, video assistant referees were used in the tournament for the first time, and the tournament expanded to 24 teams. In addition, a fourth substitution was allowed during extra time. The tournament, hosted by the United Arab Emirates for the second time, witnessed the rise of Qatar, who conquered its first ever Asian title after beating Japan in the final 3–1. The tournament was marred by the Qatar diplomatic crisis, due to the UAE&#x27;s entry ban on Qatari supporters, as well as shoe-throwing in the two teams&#x27; semi-final clash.

==Format==
===Final tournament===
Since 1972, the final tournament has been played in two stages: the group stage and the knockout stage.

Since 2019, the Asian Cup final tournament has been contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format that was used from 2004 to 2015. Each team plays three games in a group of four, with the winners and runners-up from each group advancing to the knockout stage along with four best third-placed teams. In the knockout stage, the sixteen teams compete in a single-elimination tournament, beginning with the round of 16 and ending with the final match of the tournament.


==Trophy==

There have been two Asian Cup trophies; the first one used between 1956 and 2015, and the second one in use since 2019.

The first trophy came in the form of a bowl with circular base. It was 42 centimetres tall and weighed 15 kilograms. Until the 2000 tournament, the black base contained plaques engraved with names of every winning country, as well as the edition won. The trophy was redesigned, adding more silver and reducing the black base to just a thin layer down. This base was plaque-free and the winning countries&#x27; names were engraved around the base.

During the draw for the 2019 group stage on 4 May 2018 at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, an all-new trophy, made by London Silversmiths Thomas Lyte, was unveiled. It is 78 centimetres tall, 42 centimetres wide, and weighs 15 kilograms of Hallmarked sterling silver. It took a team of 12 over 450 hours to handcraft the trophy. 

The trophy is modelled after the lotus flower, a symbolically important aquatic Asian plant. The five petals of the lotus symbolize the five sub-confederations under the AFC. The winning countries&#x27; names are engraved around the trophy base, which is separable from the trophy&#x27;s main body. This trophy has a handle on each side, unlike its predecessor.

==Summary==
First four edition of competition only had four or five teams and played in one single group. Since 1972, the final tournament has introduced the knockout stage. Since 2019, no third place play-off has been played; from 2023, losing semi-finalists are ranked by the AFC based on goal difference in the semi-finals.

==Records and statistics==

==Controversies==
Despite being the second oldest continental football tournament, the AFC Asian Cup has suffered numerous criticisms. Criticisms over the inability of the AFC Asian Cup to attract large attendances, political interference, high costs of traveling between AFC member states and different cultures were highlighted over the Asian Cup.

===Political interference===
The AFC Asian Cup is marked with numerous instances of political interference. One of these was the case of Israel, as the team used to be a member of the AFC but following the Yom Kippur War and increasing hostility from the Arab AFC members, Israel was expelled from the AFC in 1974 and had to compete in the OFC, until being granted UEFA membership in 1990. Meanwhile, similar cases also exist in other AFC tournaments like the one between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Following the 2016 attack on the Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran, Saudi Arabia had refused to play against Iran and even threatened to withdraw, afterwards blowing over onto international level. Tensions between the two Koreas during qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup had led North Korea to withdraw from hosting the South Korean team and refusing to display the South Korean flag and play their national anthem. As a result, North Korea&#x27;s home matches were moved to Shanghai.

===Low attendances===
Low crowds have also been another problem for the AFC Asian Cup. At the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, there had been concerns over low record of crowds due to little football interests and high costs of traveling between Asian nations leading to then-Australia coach Holger Osieck claiming that the Qatar Armed Forces were used to fill up the stadiums simply for aesthetics, while Australia international Brett Holman commented, &quot;Worldwide it&#x27;s not recognized as a good tournament&quot;.

In 2010, Qatar was chosen as the host country for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The country is set to become the first in the Middle East to host the world&#x27;s biggest sporting event, triumphing over strong competition from the United States and Australia. Approximately 5 billion people were involved in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, as they followed tournament content through various platforms and devices in the media universe.

On 10 Feb 2024, the AFC announced that the tournament in Qatar had surpassed the previous total attendance record of 1.04 million set during the 2004 tournament in China, with a new record of 1.06 million. This achievement was reached prior to the quarter-final stage.

<text>The CONCACAF Gold Cup () is the main association football competition of the men&#x27;s national football teams governed by CONCACAF, determining the continental champions of North America (Northern America, Central America, and the Caribbean). The Gold Cup is held every two years. The tournament succeeded the CONCACAF Championship (1963–1989), with its inaugural edition being held in 1991.

So far, only three national teams have won the tournament: Canada, Mexico, and the United States. All of them are member associations of the North American Football Union (NAFU).

==History==
===Championships before CONCACAF===
Before the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) was formed in 1961, association football in the region was divided into smaller, regional divisions. The two main bodies consisted of the Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (CCCF) founded in 1938 (consisting of Central America and most of the Caribbean) and the North American Football Confederation (NAFC) founded in 1946 (consisting of the North American nations of United States, Mexico, Canada, and Cuba). Each confederation held its own competition, the CCCF Championship and the NAFC Championship. The CCCF held 10 championships from 1941 to 1961 with Costa Rica winning seven times. The NAFC held four championships in 1947 and 1949, and after 41 years of absence, in 1990 and 1991 for the North American zone as the North American Nations Cup with Mexico winning three times and Canada winning once.

===CONCACAF Championship (1963–1989)===
CONCACAF was founded in 1961 through the merging of NAFC and CCCF which resulted in a single championship being held for the continent. The first CONCACAF tournament was held in 1963 in El Salvador with Costa Rica becoming the first champion. The CONCACAF Campeonato de Naciones, as it was called, was held every two years from 1963 to 1973. The second tournament was held in Guatemala in 1965 when Mexico defeated the host country in the final of a six-team tournament. The 1967 competition was held in Honduras and saw a third champion crowned, Guatemala. Costa Rica won their second title as hosts in 1969, knocking off Guatemala, while two years later, Mexico won their second championship as the tournament moved to Trinidad and Tobago, the first time in the Caribbean. In 1973, the tournament kept the same format of six teams playing a single round-robin, but there were bigger stakes attached: CONCACAF&#x27;s berth in the FIFA World Cup tournament in 1974. In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the host country pulled off an upset by winning the tournament and claiming a spot in the World Cup in West Germany.

With the Campeonato de Naciones doubling as the final World Cup qualifying tournament, the next two editions were held in Mexico City and Tegucigalpa, Honduras in 1977 and 1981, respectively. In each case the host country was crowned champion and earned a spot in the World Cup. In 1985 and 1989, the winner of the World Cup qualifying tournament was again crowned Confederation champion. Canada and Costa Rica were named champions in 1985 and 1989, receiving a trophy.

===CONCACAF Gold Cup (since 1991)===

In 1990, CONCACAF renamed and restructured the CONCACAF Championship as the CONCACAF Gold Cup, with the United States hosting the first competition in 1991, and hosting or co-hosting every subsequent iteration of the tournament (as of 2023). The host country was the inaugural champion of the eight-team tournament. Mexico dominated the remainder of the decade, winning three consecutive CONCACAF Gold Cup titles in 1993, 1996 and 1998.

In 1996, the Gold Cup field included its first guest team, the defending FIFA World Cup Champions Brazil. Guests were invited to participate in the six Gold Cup tournaments from 1996 to 2005. Starting with the 2000 Gold Cup, the tournament field was increased to twelve teams and for the 2007 tournament, the Gold Cup again was contested exclusively by nations within CONCACAF.

The 2007 Gold Cup hosts successfully defended their title beating Mexico in the final 2–1 in Chicago; Canada and Guadeloupe shared third place. Mexico won the 2009 Gold Cup by beating the United States 5–0. In the 2011 Gold Cup, Mexico defeated the USA 4–2 in the final while the USA won the 2013 Gold Cup by beating Panama 1–0.

Since the formation of the Gold Cup in 1991, the CONCACAF Championship has been won nine times by Mexico, seven times by the United States, and once by Canada. Runners-up include Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, and Jamaica.

Before 2015, when the Gold Cup did not fall in the same year as the FIFA Confederations Cup, the winner, or highest-placed team that is a member of both CONCACAF and FIFA, qualified for the next staging of that tournament. In 2015, the winners of the previous two Gold Cups (the 2013 and 2015 editions) faced each other in CONCACAF Cup – a playoff to determine the CONCACAF entrant to the 2017 Confederations Cup.

In January 2017, Victor Montagliani announced the expansion of the Gold Cup from 12 to 16 teams, starting with the 2019 tournament. In November 2018, Costa Rica was announced as one of the hosts of the 2019 tournament, with a group B double-header set to be held at the Estadio Nacional. In April 2019, it was announced that Jamaica would host a doubleheader in group C at Independence Park.

==Evolution of the format==

The number of teams in the final tournament has gradually increased over the years. Each tournament has consisted of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.

There has been interest from numerous sources to have the tournament held every four years to potentially increase the prestige, decrease player fatigue and better align with the European and South American calendars.

==Awards==

There are currently five post-tournament awards:
* Best Player – for the best player throughout the tournament
* Top Scorer – for most prolific goal scorer
* Best Goalkeeper – for most outstanding goalkeeper
* Fair Play Award – for the team with the best record of fair play
* Young Player Award – for the best young player
==Invitees==
The 1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the first iteration to have a guest from a different confederation, Brazil from CONMEBOL. In spite of bringing their under-23 team, Brazil finished as runners-up to Mexico and outplaced seven teams from CONCACAF. For the next decade, six countries from three confederations would make appearances in the Gold Cup, with seven of the eleven appearances finishing within the top four. Starting in 2007, CONCACAF would no longer invite guests from other confederations. This is primarily due to giving more opportunities from teams in the region to compete, as there was a rise in performances from the region hinted by the FIFA World Ranking.

After a 16-year hiatus from guest nations, Qatar were invited and participated in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, losing in the semi-finals to the United States. Qatar also participated in the 2023 Gold Cup, where they lost 4–0 to Panama in the quarter-finals.

===Invitees nations record===
==Media coverage==
In Canada, after years on Sportsnet and TSN, it has been broadcast exclusively on OneSoccer since 2021. In Mexico it airs on Televisa and TV Azteca. In the United States, the CONCACAF Gold Cup airs on Fox Sports and Univision (since 2000). CONCACAF also streams Gold Cup matches on YouTube with some geo-restrictions.

==Trophy==
The Gold Cup trophy is awarded to the champions of the tournament. The design of the trophy has changed multiple times since its inaugural version. Changes include scaling down of the size as well as replacing the original flat rectangular base with an elevated round pedestal. The base includes engravings of the champion nation with the year in which they won the trophy.

<doc id="250686" wikidata="Q5493143" url="?curid=250686" title="William George Ward">
<text>William George Ward (21 March 1812 – 6 July 1882) was an English theologian and mathematician. A Roman Catholic convert, his career illustrates the development of religious opinion at a time of crisis in the history of English religious thought.

==Life==
He was the son of William Ward and Emily Combe. He was educated at Winchester College and went up to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1830, but his father&#x27;s financial difficulties forced him in 1833 to try for a scholarship at Lincoln College, which he succeeded in obtaining. Ward had a gift for pure mathematics but for history, applied mathematics or anything outside the exact sciences, he felt contempt. He was endowed with a strong sense of humour and a love of paradox carried to an extreme. His examination for mathematical honours exhibited some of the peculiarities of his character and mental powers. Four out of his five papers on applied mathematics were sent up absolutely blank. Honours, however, were not refused him, and in 1834 he obtained an open fellowship at Balliol.

In the previous year, the Tractarian movement had been launched: Ward was attracted to it by his hatred of moderation and what he called &quot;respectability&quot;. He was repelled by the conception he had formed of John Henry Newman, whom he regarded as a mere antiquary. When, however, he was at length persuaded by a friend to go and hear Newman preach, he at once became a disciple. But he had, as Newman afterwards said of him, &quot;struck into the movement at an angle.&quot; He had no taste for historical investigations. He treated the question at issue as one of pure logic: disliking the Reformers, the right of private judgment which Protestants claimed, and the somewhat prosaic uniformity of the English Church, he flung himself into a campaign against Protestantism in general and the Anglican form of it in particular. He nevertheless took deacon&#x27;s orders in 1838 and priest&#x27;s orders in 1840.
In 1839 Ward became a writer for the &quot;British Critic&quot;, the organ of the Tractarian party, and he excited suspicion among the adherents of the party by his violent denunciations of the Anglican Church, to which he still belonged. In 1841 he urged the publication of the celebrated &quot;Tract 90&quot;, and wrote in defence of it. From that period Ward and his associates worked undisguisedly for union with the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1844 he published his &quot;Ideal of a Christian Church&quot;, in which he openly contended that the only hope for the Church of England lay in submission to the Church of Rome. This publication brought to a height the storm which had long been gathering. The University of Oxford was invited, on 13 February 1845, to condemn &quot;Tract 90&quot;, to censure the &quot;Ideal&quot;, and to deprive Ward of his degrees. The two latter propositions were carried with Ward being deprived of his tutorship and &quot;Tract 90&quot; only escaped censure by the &quot;non-placet&quot; of the proctors, Guillemard and Church.

Ward left the Church of England in September 1845, and was followed by many others, including Newman himself. After his reception into the Catholic Church, Ward devoted himself to ethics, metaphysics and moral philosophy. After his conversion he married, and for a time had to struggle with poverty. But his circumstances slowly improved. In 1851 he became a professor of moral philosophy at St Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, and the following year he was appointed to the chair of dogmatic theology.

==&quot;Dublin Review&quot;==

Ward wrote articles on free will, the philosophy of theism, and on science, prayer and miracles for the &quot;Dublin Review&quot;. In 1863 he became editor of the Dublin Review (1863–1878). He took over as editor in July 1863, deferring editorial decisions on politics, history, or literature to sub-editors. He was an opponent of Liberal Catholicism and defender of papal authority, and attacked the views of Charles Forbes René de Montalembert and Ignaz von Döllinger. He supported the promulgation of the dogma of Papal Infallibility in 1870. He also dealt with the condemnation of Pope Honorius I, carried on a controversial correspondence with John Stuart Mill, and took a leading part in the discussions of the Metaphysical Society.

==Family==
Ward was the grandnephew of Robert Plumer Ward, the nephew of Sir Henry George Ward, and the son of William Ward.

He was the father of Newman&#x27;s biographer, Wilfrid Philip Ward; a grandfather of Father Leo Ward, a missionary in Japan and co-founder of Sheed &amp; Ward, and of Leo&#x27;s sister, the writer and publisher Maisie Ward; and a great-grandfather of the translator Rosemary Sheed, and of Rosemary&#x27;s brother, the novelist Wilfrid Sheed. His daughter was professed as a Benedictine nun and became Lady Abbess of Oulton Abbey, Staffordshire.

<text>Publius Terentius Varro Atacinus (; 82 – c. 35 BC) was a Roman poet, more polished in his style than the more famous and learned Varro Reatinus, his contemporary, and therefore more widely read by the Augustan writers. He was born in the province of Gallia Narbonensis, the southern part of Gaul with its capital at Narbonne, on the river Atax (now the Aude), for his cognomen &quot;Atacinus&quot; indicates his birthplace.

==Writings==
Only fragments of his works survive. His first known works are , a poem on Julius Caesar&#x27;s campaign against Ariovistus, and some satires; these should not be confused with the &quot;Menippean Satires&quot; of the other Varro, of which some 600 fragments survive. He also wrote a geographical poem, &quot;Chorographia&quot;; &quot;Ephemeris&quot;, a hexameter poem on weather-signs after Aratus, from which Virgil has borrowed and (late in life) elegies to Leucadia.

His translation of the Alexandrian poet Apollonius Rhodius&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot; into Latin has some fine surviving lines; and was singled out for praise by Ovid: “Of Varro too what age will not be told/And Jason’s Argo and the fleece of gold?”. Oskar Seyffert considered that the poem to have been “the most remarkable production in the domain of narrative epic poetry between the time of Ennius and that of Vergil”.

Of Varro&#x27;s fragments, the epigram on &quot;The Tombs of the Great&quot; is well-known; whether or not it is truly Varro&#x27;s is debatable:
==Patrons==
Cicero as well as Caesar have been suggested as possible patrons of Varro&#x27;s writings.

<text>The OFC Men&#x27;s Nations Cup, known as the OFC Nations Cup before the 2024 edition, is the primary association football competition contested by the senior men&#x27;s national teams of the members of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), determining the continental champion of Oceania. The winning team became the champion of Oceania and until 2016 qualified for the FIFA Confederations Cup.

Historically, a very large gulf separated Australia and New Zealand from the smaller island competitors, and little attention was paid to the tournament by the rest of the football world. The 2012 OFC Nations Cup is the only edition to date not won by either New Zealand or Australia, being won by Tahiti instead.

==History==
===First editions (1973–1980)===
This tournament began in 1973 as the &quot;Oceania Cup&quot;. This first edition was staged without a qualifying round and was won by the host in Auckland, New Zealand, that defeated Tahiti, 2–0. The tournament was characterised by the absence of the Australian team and the presence of some teams not members of FIFA, such as New Hebrides, which later became Vanuatu after gaining independence in 1980.

The second edition of the Oceania Cup took place in 1980 in New Caledonia, at that time not a FIFA member. Australia 
played the final match in Nouméa and defeated Tahiti, 4–2. The tournament was characterised by a poor result for New Zealand: out in the group stage losing against Tahiti (3–1) and Fiji (4–0). Two years later they qualified for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. These two editions were the only without qualifying rounds. After this edition the tournament was discontinued. So Australia maintained the Oceania Champion title for 16 years without playing in any tournaments. Between the years of absence (1981–1995) the most important Oceanian region tournament was the Trans-Tasman Cup played only between Australia and New Zealand.

===Return, every two years (1996–2004)===
In 1996, when OFC reached the official status of Confederation for FIFA, the tournament reappeared as the &quot;Oceania Nations Cup&quot; and served as a qualifier for the Confederations Cup. The 1996 edition lacked a host nation but had its inaugural qualifying round, contested with four teams playing semifinals and final match on two legs both: Australia and New Zealand, who played the semifinal also for the Trans-Tasman Cup, and the second semifinal match between Tahiti as Polynesia Cup holders and Solomon Islands as Melanesia Cup holders. Australia defended its title of The Cup winning easily in the final match, on two legs, against Tahiti (6–0 and 5–0). The topscorer of this tournament, Kris Trajanovski, scored all his seven goals in the final tie: four in the first leg in Papeete (Tahiti) and three in the second leg in Canberra (Australia). Thanks to this result, this Australian team, managed by the English Terry Venables and not by the Scottish Oceania Champion Eddie Thomson, took part to the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup in Saudi Arabia.

In the 1998 edition six teams participated, hosted by Australia and dominated by Australia and New Zealand. In the final match, played in Brisbane, New Zealand beat the host Australia 1–0 with a goal by Mark Burton. In this edition the Australian player Damian Mori scored 10 goals, the standing record. He is also the overall Oceania Nations Cup top scorer with 14 goals, scored in three editions: one in 1996, ten in 1998 and three in 2002.

The fifth edition was hosted by Tahiti in 2000. The tournament structure was confirmed and again the tournament was dominated by Australia and New Zealand who reached the final match in Papeete. Australia won their third title by a score of 2–0, qualifying for the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Fiji, who qualified for this edition, was forced to withdraw due to civil war and was replaced by Vanuatu, who impressed in the semifinal against Australia: the &quot;Socceroos&quot;, managed by Frank Farina, won 1–0 thanks only to a penalty kick by Kevin Muscat. Two years later the Australian team finished third in the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Korea and Japan.

For the 2002 edition, hosted by New Zealand, eight teams participated, divided into two groups won by Australia and New Zealand. This was their third consecutive final match. The Australian side won the semifinal against a brave Tahiti only after extra time. Soccer Australia was involved in financial problems: the non-existent financial contribution meant that the Australian players had to pay their own way to get to New Zealand, so Scott Chipperfield became the only one of Australia&#x27;s large European contingent to answer the call and perform for his country in their time of need, resulting in a weak team for the tournament. So the final was won for the third time by the &quot;All Whites&quot; beating their historical rivals 1–0 in Auckland with a late Ryan Nelsen goal.

In the 2004 edition, which served also as the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification and was played in Australia, six nations took part playing each other in a unique group, with the first two playing a final match in two legs. During the group stage Vanuatu surprisingly beat New Zealand 4–2, but lost all their remaining matches. This and a draw with Australia (2–2) allowed Solomon Islands to claim second place and a berth in the final match against Australia. In the final, the Solomon Islands were beaten 5–1 on their home ground Honiara and 6–0 in Sydney. Moreover, this was the first, and until today the only time that a coach, Frank Farina, has won the Oceania Nations Cup trophy twice. Two years later, managed by Dutchman Guus Hiddink and composed of many 2004 Oceania Nations Cup scorers such as Tim Cahill, Harry Kewell, Mark Bresciano, Brett Emerton, John Aloisi, Australia reached the second round of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. However, this was the fourth and last OFC title for Australia: in 2006 they decided to join AFC, changing considerably the Oceania football scene.

===A new era (2006–present)===
Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation on 1 January 2006, ceasing to be a member of OFC, leaving New Zealand as the only major power in the OFC. The 2007 South Pacific Games, won by New Caledonia, served as a qualifying round for the three lowest ranked teams in the OFC, with the winners qualifying for the 2008 OFC Nations Cup. The 2008 OFC Nations Cup was played without a fixed venue and with four teams playing each other at home and away in one group. The tournament also served as part of the OFC&#x27;s qualifying competition for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. New Zealand emerged easily as winners for the fourth time ahead of New Caledonia, winning five matches of six. Surprisingly, Fiji won the last match against New Zealand in Lautoka (Fiji) for 2–0 with two goals of Roy Krishna. The top-scorer Shane Smeltz (New Zealand) scored eight goals: four against the runners up New Caledonia beaten 3–1 away and 3–0 at home.

The 2012 edition of the tournament was originally meant to be played in Fiji, but they were stripped from hosting due to the ongoing legal dispute involving OFC general secretary Tai Nicholas and Fijian authorities. Hosting rights was moved to the Solomon Islands as they were joined by New Zealand, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tahiti, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa (winner of the qualifying tournament). The draw which was similar to the 2012 edition with them competing in two groups of four teams, with the top two in each group qualifying for the semi-finals. After 9 days, Tahiti and New Caledonia reached the final in Lawson Tama Stadium with Tahiti winning 1–0 with a goal from Steevy Chong Hue. With this, Tahiti became the first team other than Australia (no longer part of OFC) and New Zealand to be crowned Oceania champions. The tournament also served as part of the OFC&#x27;s qualifying competition for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

After the cancellation of the 2020 OFC Nations Cup, the tournament was confirmed for 2024 as the 2024 OFC Men&#x27;s Nations Cup. The tournament will follow the same style, but will not serve as World Cup qualifiers.

==Format==

The first two editions were played without any qualifying rounds. For the successive three tournaments, Australia and New Zealand were seeded into the tournament automatically, while the remaining ten nations played to qualify. The Polynesian and Melanesian Cups, each played between five nations grouped on a geographical basis, served as qualifications via a round-robin tournament, with the highest ranked two teams in each competition qualifying for the actual OFC Nations Cup.

With the postponement and then cancellation of the Melanesian Cup, and a similar fate befalling its Polynesian equivalent, the format of the tournament changed in 2002. FIFA rankings determined the seedings of all twelve teams, and the lower six teams played a group stage for two qualifier positions into the main tournament. The 2002 Cup tournament proper was played with two groups of four teams (again in round-robin style), which led into a 4-way knockout stage, playing for the top four positions.

In 2004, the format changed once again, returning to a format similar to that of the 1996–2000 tournaments, with five teams each playing in two qualifying groups and Australia and New Zealand seeded to the actual tournament, played as a group stage of six, with a home and away Final played between the two highest-placed teams. This tournament doubled also as qualifying round for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

For the 2008 tournament, the format altered again. The 2007 South Pacific Games football tournament served as a qualification tournament, with the gold, silver and bronze winning nations progressing to the main, round-robin format, tournament, for which New Zealand qualified automatically. New Zealand emerged as winners of the 2008 OFC Nations Cup, ahead of New Caledonia, and thus qualified for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and a playoff with the fifth placed team from the AFC for a place in the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

<doc id="250692" wikidata="Q8520" url="?curid=250692" title="Schwäbisch Hall (district)">
<text>Schwäbisch Hall () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northeast of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Main-Tauber, the Bavarian district Ansbach, Ostalbkreis, Rems-Murr, and Hohenlohe.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Schwäbisch Hall&quot;, which was created in 1803, when the previously free imperial city Schwäbisch Hall became part of Württemberg. After several minor changes, it was converted into a district in 1938. In 1973, it was merged with the district Crailsheim and the area around Gaildorf, which was part of the also dissolved district Backnang.

==Geography==
The two rivers Jagst and Kocher, tributaries to the Neckar, flow through the district. The landscapes covered by the district are the Hohenlohe plain (&quot;Hohenloher Ebene&quot;), the Swabian-Franconian Forest (&quot;Schwäbisch-Fränkischen Waldberge&quot;), which includes part of the Mainhardt Forest, and the &quot;Frankenhöhe&quot;.

==Partnerships==
The district maintains partnerships with the district Delitzsch (now part of Nordsachsen) in Saxony and the Polish commune of Zamość.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows a coin in the top part. The city of Schwäbisch Hall was one of the most important minting towns, the local coin &quot;Heller&quot; was well known in all of Germany. Below the coin are two hooks, taken from the coat of arms of the district Crailsheim, as well as from the city of Gaildorf. The black-and-white checkered area at the bottom is taken from the coat of arms of the Hohenzollern dynasty, who ruled the area historically.

<text>Luther Wallace Youngdahl (May 29, 1896 – June 21, 1978) was an American judge and politician who served as the 27th governor of Minnesota and a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

==Education and career==

Born on May 29, 1896, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Youngdahl graduated from Minneapolis South High School. He then received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1919 from Gustavus Adolphus College and a Bachelor of Laws in 1921 from the Minnesota College of Law (now Mitchell Hamline School of Law). He served as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army during World War I. He was an assistant city attorney for Minneapolis from 1921 to 1924 and in private practice from 1924 to 1930. He was a judge of the Minneapolis Municipal Court from 1930 to 1936 and of the Minnesota District Court for the Fourth Judicial District from 1936 to 1942. He was an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court from 1942 to 1946. A member of the Republican Party, he was the governor of Minnesota from January 8, 1947, to September 27, 1951.

As governor, one of Youngdahl&#x27;s biggest concerns was mental health, and he made reforms to Minnesota&#x27;s mental health care system. In October 1949, Youngdahl burned more than 300 straitjackets and restraints. He also increased funding for public education, expanded public housing, increased benefits for war veterans, created activities to improve the health of young people, desegregated the state&#x27;s National Guard, passed anti-discrimination laws in employment, and banned slot machines and strengthened anti-liquor laws, despite the legislature&#x27;s opposition.

==Federal judicial service==

Youngdahl was a popular governor who won reelection easily in 1950, but as early as 1949 he expressed to a friend his desire to return to the judiciary, this time at the federal level. Believing that Youngdahl would be the strongest candidate the Republicans could run against him when he sought reelection in 1954, upon learning of Judge Thomas Alan Goldsborough&#x27;s death from a heart attack, Minnesota&#x27;s junior U.S. senator, Hubert Humphrey, proposed nominating Youngdahl to Goldsborough&#x27;s now-vacant seat on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in a meeting with President Harry S. Truman on July 2, 1951. Noting that Youngdahl was the only governor who had written a letter commending him for his recent decision to fire General Douglas MacArthur, Truman agreed to the suggestion.

After meeting with Youngdahl on July 5, Truman appointed him the next day to the vacancy on the D.C. district court. The United States Senate confirmed Youngdahl on August 28, 1951, and he received his commission the next day. He assumed senior status on May 29, 1966, his 70th birthday.

As a senior judge, Youngdahl advocated education and job training for incarcerated criminals and less crowded programs to rehabilitate drug users, believing that harsh punishments failed to reduce crime. In an address to Congress in 1971, Youngdahl praised Democrats for supporting revenue sharing and decentralization and Republicans for their proposed Family Assistance Plan, which would have guaranteed families a minimum income. He said both parties needed to rise above partisan politics and work together.

He died on June 21, 1978, at his home in Washington, D.C. at the age of 82 after suffering from a &quot;lingering illness&quot;, and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Clyde Elmer Anderson (March 16, 1912 – January 22, 1998) was an American politician who served as the 28th governor of Minnesota from September 27, 1951 to January 5, 1955. Anderson also served as the lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 1939 to 1943 and again from 1945 to 1951.

==Life and career==
Anderson was born in Brainerd, Minnesota, in 1912 to Fred and Anna Anderson, Swedish-speaking Finnish immigrants from Lappfors in Esse, Finland. His father died when he was 14, forcing him to get a job with a magazine and newspaper company to help support the family. He attended Brainerd High School and spent two quarters at the University of Minnesota studying medicine before running out of tuition money and returning home to continue working.

In 1938, he ran for lieutenant governor of Minnesota with Republican gubernatorial candidate Harold Stassen and won. At 31 and 26 years old, respectively, Stassen and Anderson were the youngest governor and lieutenant governor in state history. Anderson was reelected lieutenant governor five more times under three different governors. He holds the record for the most total years served as the state&#x27;s lieutenant governor.

In September 1951, Anderson became governor when Luther Youngdahl resigned to become a federal judge in Washington, D.C. He won election to a full term in 1952 but was defeated by Orville Freeman two years later. After leaving the governor&#x27;s office, he served as mayor of Nisswa from 1961 to 1963 and as mayor of Brainerd from 1976 to 1986. He died in Brainerd in 1998. The C. Elmer Anderson Memorial Highway is named in his honor.

<text>Elmer Lee Andersen (June 17, 1909 – November 15, 2004) was an American businessman, philanthropist, and politician who built a successful business career with the H. B. Fuller Company. Andersen was most notably the 30th governor of Minnesota. A self-described progressive Republican, he was a well-regarded politician who passed many social and environmental regulations during his time as governor.

In one of the closest elections in the history of Minnesota and the United States, Andersen lost the 1962 Minnesota gubernatorial election by 91 votes to Karl Rolvaag.

== Early life and education ==
Andersen was born in Chicago. His mother, Jennie Olivia Johnson (1877–1925), was the daughter of a seaman from Luleå, Sweden, who came to America as a young man and worked in the timber business. Elmer&#x27;s father, Arne Kjelsberg Andersen (1866–1926), was an immigrant from Solør, Norway, who had settled in Chicago and became a streetcar motorman, operating on the Halsted streetcar line out of the Ashland Avenue car barns. &quot;My earliest memory&quot;, Andersen wrote in his memoirs, &quot;is of riding with him on the streetcar and being permitted to clang the bell as we came to street crossings.&quot; His parents separated when he was six years old. Andersen never understood why his parents separated and never questioned them. He and his mother and infant sister, Caroline, moved to Muskegon, Michigan. His two older brothers, Arnold and Marvin, arrived in Muskegon later. The Andersens had only sporadic contact with their father after the separation. At age nine, Elmer contracted a mild form of polio but, through exercise, regained his strength.

Andersen&#x27;s brothers worked for E. H. Sheldon and Company in Muskegon, a manufacturer of specialty school furniture. Too young to work in the factory, Elmer&#x27;s first job was helping his mother, who took in washing. From there he moved on to selling newspapers, vegetables, specialty products, candy bars and soft drinks. He also carried travelers&#x27; bags from the boat docks to the train station. &quot;I love selling&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I love the interchange with people. A good salesman gains influence on another person&#x27;s mind. That makes selling quite a serious undertaking.&quot; At age 14, Andersen joined his brothers at Sheldon and Company. He also wrote short essays on birds that were published in the Muskegon &quot;Chronicle&quot;. &quot;The thrill I had seeing those columns in print was the start of an abiding attraction to the newspaper business.&quot;

Andersen&#x27;s mother was devoted to church work and ensured that her children were raised in the Lutheran church; Andersen was confirmed at Our Savior&#x27;s Lutheran Church in Muskegon. In 1925, his mother contracted a cold that developed into pneumonia. She died at home on March 3, 1925, with Andersen at her bedside. Within a year, his father also died, of a heart attack.

Andersen graduated from high school in 1926 and became a member of the first class of the newly established Muskegon Junior College. Upon graduating two years later, he received the first diploma awarded by the school. While in college, he held a sales job with J. J. Fagan and Company, a real estate firm, and worked as a stringer for the Muskegon &quot;Chronicle&quot;, while starting a newspaper for the junior college. Not long after, he and his brothers started a company, Muskegon Realty, which also sold casualty insurance for the Mercury Insurance Company. &quot;I matured fast in those years. I was selling homes and farms. I was selling insurance. I was editing a college newspaper and stringing for a daily newspaper. I was studying and learning about things I had never known existed. It was almost an incredible time.&quot;

Andersen graduated from junior college in 1928. For the next year, he worked as a salesman for the Sheldon Company, working out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. &quot;A year in Minneapolis left me convinced that I wanted something more. I wanted to enroll at the University of Minnesota. I usually approach a new venture with specific objectives. In aiming for the University of Minnesota, I had three: I wanted to get a degree for reasons of job protection. I did not want somebody to push ahead of me because he had a degree and I did not. Another object was to meet a woman whom I might marry. I was beginning to long for a home life and a family. I was lonely. I discovered that being a traveling salesman, on the road all the time, was no way to meet the kind of women I wanted to meet. My third objective was to have a good time! I had been a fairly successful salesman and quite frugal with my earnings...So, having fun, finding a girl, getting a degree—those were my objectives. If I was able to learn anything along the way, that would be purely incidental!&quot; Andersen graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1931.

== H. B. Fuller Company ==
By 1934, Andersen was growing dissatisfied with life as a traveling salesman. He heard through an associate that the H. B. Fuller Company in St. Paul, Minnesota, a manufacturer of school paste, was looking for someone to hire in sales promotion. Andersen discussed the position with the owner and president, Harvey B. Fuller Jr., and joined the company on October 8, 1934. Andersen managed sales for the H.B. Fuller Company over the next seven years until purchasing a controlling interest in the company in 1941 and taking over as president. Under his leadership, the firm became an early model of corporate responsibility, recognized for offering generous benefits to employees, their spouses, and retirees. Andersen&#x27;s corporate philosophy was built around four priorities in a definite order. The highest priority was service to the customer. &quot;Anything the customer wanted should be seen as an opportunity for us to provide it. Number two was that the company should exist deliberately for the benefit of the people associated in it. I never liked the word employee. It intimated a difference in class within a plant. We always used the word associate. Fuller&#x27;s third priority was to make money. To survive, you have to make money. To grow, you need money. To conduct research and develop new products, you must have money. The need for money can be desperate at times. But corporations must put the quest for money in its proper place. Our philosophy did not leave out service to the larger community. We put it in fourth place, behind service to customers, our associates, and the bottom line. Community service cannot be paramount to a business, but it ought not to be omitted, as it too often is. Business must concern itself with the larger society—for reasons of self-interest if nothing else.&quot;

Under Andersen&#x27;s guidance, Fuller grew from a small plant to an international Fortune 500 company. Its expansion strategy baffled the competition. Competitors thought the company was struggling to keep all the new plants afloat, but the opposite was true. Other leaders in the adhesives industry operated in New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco. &quot;They had huge plants and big established investments. They could not start a new plant. What would they do with their big old plant? By comparison, we were popping around the country and setting up small plants in lively little markets. We kept our real estate costs down. We did not have large freight charges to pass on to the customer. National Adhesives, the biggest company in the industry, was very focused on making money. They maintained their prices at a high level, even when their share of the market dropped, in order to make more money. That was a blessing for little companies like Fuller.&quot;

In 1968, Fuller became a publicly traded company. By 1970, it had become an adhesives industry leader, with 27 plants and offices in the U.S. and ten in foreign countries. The goal Andersen had set decades before of doubling its sales volume every five years was still being met. In 1970, Fuller reached about $48 million in sales. Andersen retired as president and chief executive officer in 1974, at age 65, turning the company over to his eldest son, Tony.

== Dairy farm ==
In 1953, 12 years after becoming president of the H. B. Fuller Company, Andersen entered the dairy business, buying a farm held by his wife&#x27;s family on Deer Lake, near St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. It was the start of 35 years in the dairy business, with about 200 head of cattle. The herd was slowly converted to registered Holsteins. In 1984, Deer Lake Farm received the National Holstein Association&#x27;s Progressive Breeder Award. Additional land was acquired in the 1950s, and environmental restoration projects were undertaken on the expanded farm. After Andersen moved out of the dairy business in 1988, 80 acres of land surrounding one of the ponds were placed in a land preserve to honor the memories of his wife&#x27;s parents.

== ECM Publishers ==
In 1974, Andersen began a new career as a newspaper publisher and writer. He acquired two newspapers to form the &quot;Princeton Union-Eagle&quot;, which eventually became part of ECM Publishers, which published a number of weekly local newspapers and shoppers. Andersen wrote editorials for the ECM papers, many of which are gathered in &quot;Views from the Publisher&#x27;s Desk&quot; (1997). His newspaper work gave him &quot;more personal satisfaction than almost anything else I have done&quot;. His editorial goal was to make his readers think without telling them what to think. The Andersen family sold ECM to Adams Publishing Group in 2016.

== Politics ==

A progressive Republican, Andersen served in the Minnesota legislature from 1949 to 1958. Among the many causes he championed were educational programs for exceptional children, recognition of alcoholism as a health problem, the Metropolitan Planning Commission in the Twin Cities, and the Fair Employment Practices Act (Minnesota was the fifth state to pass legislation on this issue). After the anti-discrimination bill passed, Andersen was greeted by an African-American, who told him that for the first time he felt like a &quot;real man&quot;. Andersen described this moment as one of his most touching memories.

=== Governors of Minnesota ===
In 1960, Andersen ran for governor against incumbent Democrat Orville Freeman. In 1999, he said he decided to run after hearing Freeman wish he could again call the Minnesota National Guard to bust a strike at an Albert Lea meatpacking plant, after a federal judge blocked that decision. Andersen won by more than 20,000 votes. During his term, the common loon became the Minnesota state bird, several state parks were established, and the Taconite Amendment and fair housing legislation passed. He lost reelection two years later by the closest margin in U.S. history. The election was held on November 6, 1962, but the results were not known until March 21, 1963. After recounts and court challenges, it was determined that then-Lieutenant Governor Karl Rolvaag had defeated Andersen by 91 votes out of nearly 1.3 million cast, 619,842 to 619,751. On February 14, 1963, Andersen issued a statement that if he were reelected as governor, he would veto any right-to-work legislation disguised as &quot;compulsory open shop legislation&quot;. Andersen believed that right-to-work laws would weaken Minnesota&#x27;s labor movement and cause friction between workers and management.

Andersen remained in the Republican Party for the rest of his life, but he became unhappy about how conservative the party became. Even in the 1960s, his views were in the minority of the party. In a 2003 interview with the Saint Paul &quot;Pioneer Press,&quot; he said, &quot;I remind people I want to be known as a liberal Republican. If that&#x27;s a dirty word, so be it.&quot; In the 2004 presidential election, he endorsed Democratic nominee John Kerry over incumbent Republican President George W. Bush. He was so disenchanted with the Bush administration that he wrote a commentary in the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot; claiming that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney &quot;spew outright untruths with evangelistic fervor&quot; and calling Cheney an evil man who was the administration&#x27;s real decision-maker. Unlike many other members of his party, Andersen opposed low taxes.

== University of Minnesota ==
Andersen served on the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota from 1967 to 1975 and as chair from 1972 to 1975. From 1968 to 1988, he was a trustee of the University of Minnesota Foundation, presiding over it from 1978 to 1981. During the Minnesota Campaign, the university&#x27;s major fundraising effort from 1985 to 1988, he played a major leadership role in what was, at the time, the most successful fundraising effort by any U.S. public university.

Andersen believed there was an additional mission to the three central missions—teaching, research, and community service—of the university: an archival one. The building housing the archives and special collections of the university&#x27;s libraries is named for him, in recognition of his deep belief in that mission. On May 14, 1999, the university&#x27;s Board of Regents unanimously voted to name the newest library in his honor. The Elmer L. Andersen Library opened in April 2000.

== Voyageurs National Park ==
One of Andersen&#x27;s proudest achievements came in April 1975, when Congress passed legislation establishing Voyageurs National Park—thousands of acres of forests and lakes along Minnesota&#x27;s northern border. Along with people like naturalist Sigurd Olson, legislator Willard Munger, and aviator Charles A. Lindbergh, Andersen devoted thousands of hours to persuading landowners, timber industry leaders, politicians, and citizens of the park&#x27;s value to future generations. For his work, he is remembered as the &quot;father of Voyageurs National Park&quot;.

&quot;It is flattering to have been called the father of Voyageurs Park. I think that I made a difference. But so did many, many other people, more than I could possibly name, who kept the dream alive until it came to fruition. Some of the real heroes were people in the region who opposed their friends or employers to support the park. The park also had help from another real hero—Charles Lindbergh...Charles A. Lindbergh&#x27;s name deserves a prominent place in the annals of Voyageurs National Park. The man who did so much for the development of aviation also did much for his home state, for the cause of wilderness preservation—and for me.&quot;

== Book collector ==
Andersen developed a passion for books as a child and collected them all his life. As a young traveling salesman, he saved his loose change and spent it on books. His hunt for books brought him into contact with dealers, other collectors, printers and librarians. He was well-acquainted with book and auction catalogues; paging through them became a welcome break in a busy day. Andersen bought books with a purpose, to build a library. He intended to read them, know them well, catalog them, and care for them. American and English history and literature and inspirational poetry were of particular interest to him, but as his interests expanded so did his reading and his library. When he came to Minnesota, he became interested in the state&#x27;s history. When he learned more about fine printing and printers, he turned to William Morris and the Kelmscott Press. And when he discovered something new, like the Whittington Press, he made sure that the University of Minnesota owned the printer&#x27;s entire archive.

While writing his &quot;Princeton Union-Eagle&quot; editorials, Andersen wrote a column on book collecting using the name Arne Kjelsberg, his father&#x27;s first two names. He did not reveal his authorship of the column for many years, though a close friend guessed. Andersen was a longtime member of the bibliophilic Ampersand Club, and his Arne Kjelsberg articles were published the year after his death in honor of the club&#x27;s 75th anniversary, in 2005. Compilation of the volume commenced while Andersen lived, and he expressed hope to attend its publication party.

Andersen&#x27;s wife supported his bibliomania. Together, their book buying was intimately connected with book giving and support for libraries and reading. Public libraries around the state and other book concerns benefited from their support and interest. They were major benefactors of the University of Minnesota and its libraries. Much of the collection at the Andersen Horticultural Library at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum , which bears Andersen&#x27;s name, is a result of their generosity. The gift of his personal library of 12,500 rare volumes in March 1999 was described in the Minneapolis &quot;Star Tribune&quot; as &quot;a gift of the heart.&quot;

==Personal life and legacy==
Andersen met Eleanor Anne Johnson (1911–2011) at Grace University Lutheran Church while they were both students. She was the eldest child of Gustav A. and Elizabeth Johnson, both Swedish immigrants. The Andersens married on September 1, 1932. Eleanor&#x27;s sister Edith Johnson later married future Minnesota Senator Stanley W. Holmquist. The Andersens settled in the Twin Cities. Eleanor decided to leave the university when they were married and postpone the completion of her degree. Andersen credited his wife for many of his accomplishments. They had three children. Several years later, Eleanor Andersen earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree.

Andersen wrote a number of books, including his autobiography, &quot;A Man&#x27;s Reach&quot;; a collection of newspaper articles, &quot;Views from the Publisher&#x27;s Desk&quot;; a collection of speeches and reflections, &quot;I Trust to Be Believed&quot;; and &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Tour&quot;, a guide to the Minnesota state capitol building.

The Elmer L. and Eleanor J. Andersen Foundation was founded in 1957.

Andersen died in Minneapolis on November 15, 2004, just months after a gala celebration of his 95th birthday held in the library devoted to that bears his name, the Elmer L. Andersen Library. The library is the home of archives and special collections. He was the last living former American governor born in the 1900s decade. The Minnesota Department of Human Services Building in St. Paul is also named for him.

<text>Karl Fritjof Rolvaag (July 18, 1913 – December 20, 1990) was an American diplomat and politician who served as the 31st governor of Minnesota from March 25, 1963, to January 2, 1967, as a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party. He was the son of the author and professor Ole E. Rølvaag.

The 1962 election was held on November 6, but the results were not known until a 139-day recount was completed in March 1963. Rolvaag won the closest gubernatorial election in state history, defeating the incumbent, Elmer L. Andersen by 91 votes out of over 1.3 million cast. He is one of only five Minnesota Democrats to win a gubernatorial election with a Democrat in the White House.

==Life and career==
A native of Northfield, Minnesota, Rolvaag lived in his hometown and graduated from St. Olaf College. He then fought in World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant and commanding a tank. After the war, he went to Norway to learn about politics before returning home to Minnesota, where he became the head of the DFL Party. In 1954, he was elected lieutenant governor. After serving in that capacity for eight years, Rolvaag mounted his successful campaign for governor in 1962.

Rolvaag was the first Minnesota governor to serve a four-year term, but due to continuous wrangling between him and the conservative-controlled legislature, there were few notable achievements during his term. He is remembered for a leadership role in bringing reform to the state&#x27;s institutions for the mentally disabled, leading to improved conditions and treatment for people with developmental disabilities. Rolvaag also changed the organization of the state&#x27;s junior colleges. Formerly, the local school board ran each college separately; Rolvaag designed a coordinated statewide system with the goal of putting every Minnesotan within commuting distance of an institution of higher education. He also bitterly opposed significant expansion plans by the state colleges and vocally opposed designating a second state research university.

When Rolvaag ran for reelection in 1966, his party did not endorse him, opting instead for Lieutenant Governor A. M. (Sandy) Keith. Rolvaag entered the DFL&#x27;s primary with a cry of &quot;Let the people decide!&quot; and roundly defeated Keith. He lost to Republican nominee Harold LeVander in the November general election.

In 1967, after leaving office, Rolvaag was appointed United States Ambassador to Iceland by President Lyndon Johnson. He returned to Minnesota in 1970 and was elected to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. He resigned that post in 1975 in order to seek treatment for alcoholism. His alcohol addiction eventually led to the end of his 37-year marriage, but he overcame his heavy drinking in the 1980s. Rolvaag stayed out of politics the rest of his life, but helped others work through their problems with alcoholism, attending meetings and giving talks in places as nearby as his hometown of Northfield and as far off as Sweden.

Rolvaag died at his home in Northfield on December 20, 1990, aged 77, having been ill with a heart condition.

<text>Excalibur is a 1981 epic medieval fantasy film directed, cowritten and produced by John Boorman, that retells the legend of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, based loosely on the 15th-century Arthurian romance &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; by Thomas Malory. It stars Nigel Terry as Arthur, Nicol Williamson as Merlin, Nicholas Clay as Lancelot, Cherie Lunghi as Guenevere, Helen Mirren as Morgana, Liam Neeson as Gawain, Gabriel Byrne as Uther and Patrick Stewart as Leondegrance. The film is named after the legendary sword of King Arthur that features prominently in Arthurian literature. The film&#x27;s soundtrack features the music of Richard Wagner and Carl Orff, along with an original score by Trevor Jones.

Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Excalibur&quot; began development as an unproduced adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The film was shot entirely on location in Ireland and at Ardmore Studios, employing Irish actors and crew. It has been acknowledged for its importance to the Irish filmmaking industry and for helping launch the film and acting careers of a number of Irish and British actors, including Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Gabriel Byrne and Ciarán Hinds.

Reviewers praised &quot;Excalibur&quot; visual style. It won the award for Best Artistic Contribution at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival, and received an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography and a BAFTA nomination for Best Costume Design. It grossed $35 million in the United States and Canada on a budget of $11 million.

==Plot==

In the Dark Ages, the sorcerer Merlin retrieves the magical sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake for Uther Pendragon, who is declared king. In exchange for their future child, Merlin helps Uther seduce Igrayne, the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s wife, while the Duke dies in battle. Igrayne gives birth to Arthur, and Merlin takes the boy. Ambushed by the Duke&#x27;s men, a dying Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, as Merlin declares that he who pulls the sword from the stone shall be king.

Merlin entrusts Ector to raise Arthur, who becomes squire to Ector&#x27;s son Kay. As a young man, Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone, proving he is Uther&#x27;s rightful heir. Leodegrance pledges his allegiance to Arthur, but they are opposed by knights who dispute Arthur&#x27;s kingship as a bastard. Defending Leondegrance&#x27;s castle and his daughter Guenevere, Arthur defeats Uryens, whom he compels to knight him and swear fealty. Smitten with Guenevere, Arthur ignores Merlin&#x27;s warning that she will one day fall in love with someone else.

Years later, the undefeated knight Lancelot almost bests Arthur, who calls upon the power of Excalibur to defeat Lancelot, breaking the sword. The Lady of the Lake restores the sword to a remorseful Arthur, and Lancelot swears allegiance to him. Unifying the land, Arthur and his knights create the Round Table and the castle Camelot. Secretly infatuated with each other, Lancelot escorts Guenevere to her wedding to Arthur, declaring that his loyalty to the king outweighs his love for her. Arthur&#x27;s half-sister Morgana reveals to Merlin that she is a sorceress, and Lancelot brings Perceval, who hopes to become a knight, to Camelot.

Influenced by Morgana, Gawain drunkenly accuses Guenevere of betraying the king, and a duel over her innocence is set. Resolved to uphold the law as an impartial judge, Arthur cannot defend Guenevere&#x27;s honor himself. When no champion will fight for the queen, Perceval steps forward, but Lancelot arrives and defeats Gawain, sparing his life. Retreating to the forest, Lancelot is followed by a deeply moved Guenevere, and they make love. Merlin confirms this to Arthur, who thrusts Excalibur into the ground between the sleeping lovers. Merlin&#x27;s magical link to the land impales him on the sword, as Morgana traps him and steals his Charm of Making.

Taking Guenevere&#x27;s form, Morgana seduces Arthur and gives birth to a son, Mordred, infecting the land with famine and sickness. Struck by a magical bolt of lightning, a weakened Arthur sends his knights to search for the Holy Grail, hoping to restore the land and himself. Many knights die on their quest or are bewitched into Morgana&#x27;s service, but Perceval resists her attacks. Mordred reaches adulthood and demands Arthur&#x27;s crown, vowing to take Camelot by force. Unable to save Uryens from Mordred, Perceval is attacked by Lancelot, who has renounced his knighthood.

Nearly drowned, Perceval is transported to the Grail and proves himself worthy, bringing the Grail to Arthur. He drinks from the Grail and is revitalised along with the land, calling upon Kay to rally their remaining forces against Mordred. Arthur finds Guenevere at a convent, and they reconcile before she gives him back Excalibur. At Stonehenge, Arthur&#x27;s love liberates Merlin and they share a final conversation. Merlin tricks Morgana into speaking the Charm of Making, exhausting her powers and enveloping the battlefield in mist. Mordred discovers his mother&#x27;s aged, true self and murders her in disgust.

Arthur and his men battle Mordred&#x27;s forces, using the mist in their favour. Lancelot comes to Arthur&#x27;s aid, reconciling with his friend and dying a true knight. Arthur kills Mordred but is mortally wounded, and commands Perceval to throw Excalibur into the water, knowing the sword will rise again for a worthy king. The Lady of the Lake catches the sword and disappears, and Perceval watches as Arthur is carried away on a ship toward Avalon.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===

John Boorman had planned a film adaptation of the Merlin legend as early as 1969, but when submitting the three-hour script written with Rospo Pallenberg to United Artists, they rejected it deeming it too costly and offered him J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; instead. Boorman was allowed to shop the script elsewhere, but no studio would commit to it. Returning to his original idea of the Merlin legend, Boorman was eventually able to secure deals that would help him do &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Much of the imagery and set designs were created with his &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; project in mind.

===Writing===
Rospo Pallenberg and John Boorman wrote the screenplay, which is primarily an adaptation of Malory&#x27;s &quot;Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; (1469–70) recasting the Arthurian legends as an allegory of the cycle of birth, life, decay, and restoration, by stripping the text of decorative or insignificant details. The resulting film is reminiscent of mythographic works such as Sir James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and Jessie Weston&#x27;s &quot;From Ritual to Romance&quot;; Arthur is presented as the &quot;Wounded King&quot; whose realm becomes a wasteland to be reborn thanks to the Grail, and may be compared to the Fisher (or Sinner) King, whose land also became a wasteland, and was also healed by Perceval. &quot;The film has to do with &quot;mythical&quot; truth, not historical truth,&quot; Boorman remarked to a journalist during filming. The Christian symbolism revolves around the Grail, perhaps most strongly in the baptismal imagery of Perceval finally achieving the Grail quest. &quot;That&#x27;s what my story is about: the coming of Christian man and the disappearance of the old religions which are represented by Merlin. The forces of superstition and magic are swallowed up into the unconscious.&quot;
In addition to Malory, the writers incorporated elements from other Arthurian stories, sometimes altering them. For example, the sword between the sleeping lovers&#x27; bodies comes from the tales of Tristan and Iseult; the knight who returns Excalibur to the water is changed from Bedivere to Perceval; and Morgause and Morgan Le Fay are merged into one character. The sword Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone are presented as the same thing; in some versions of the legends, they are separate. In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Sir Galahad, the illegitimate son of Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, is the Knight who is worthy of the Holy Grail. Boorman follows the earlier version of the tale as told by Chrétien de Troyes, making Perceval the grail winner. Some new elements were added, such as Uther wielding Excalibur before Arthur (repeated in &quot;Merlin&quot;), Merlin&#x27;s &#x27;Charm of Making&#x27; (written in Old Irish), and the concept of the world as &quot;the dragon&quot; (probably inspired by the dragon omen seen in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s account of Merlin&#x27;s life).

;The Charm of Making
According to linguist Michael Everson, the &quot;Charm of Making&quot; that Merlin speaks to invoke the dragon is an invention, there being no attested source for the charm. Everson reconstructs the text as Old Irish. The phonetic transcription of the charm as spoken in the film is . Although the pronunciation in the film has little relation to how the text would actually be pronounced in Irish, the most likely interpretation of the spoken words, as Old Irish text is:

:Anál nathrach,
:orth’ bháis&#x27;s bethad,
:do chél dénmha

In modern English, this can be translated as:

: Serpent&#x27;s breath,
: the charm of death and life,
: thy omen of making.

===Casting===
Boorman cast Nicol Williamson and Helen Mirren opposite each other as Merlin and Morgana, knowing that the two were on less than friendly terms due to personal issues that arose during a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; seven years earlier. Boorman verified this on the &quot;Excalibur&quot; DVD commentary, saying he felt that the tension on the set would come through in the actors&#x27; performances.

Even though he was 35 years old, Nigel Terry plays King Arthur from his teenage years to his ending as an aged monarch.

Several members of the Boorman family appear in the cast: his daughter Katrine played Igraine, Arthur&#x27;s mother, and his son Charley portrayed Mordred as a boy. Because of the number of Boormans involved with the film, it is sometimes called &quot;The Boorman Family Project&quot;.

===Filming===

&quot;Excalibur&quot; was filmed in 1980 on-location in County Wicklow, County Tipperary, and County Kerry, with the interiors shot at Ardmore Studios. The costumes were designed by Bob Ringwood. The armor was designed by Terry English.

An early critical battle scene at a castle, in which Arthur is made a knight by Uryens while kneeling in a moat, was filmed in Cahir Castle, in Cahir County Tipperary, the Republic of Ireland, a well-preserved Irish castle. The castle&#x27;s moat is the River Suir which flows around it. The fight with Lancelot was filmed at Powerscourt Estate&#x27;s waterfall. Other locations included Wicklow Head as the backdrop to the battle over Tintagel, the Kerry coast as the place from which Arthur sails to Avalon, and a place called Childers Wood near Roundwood, County Wicklow, where Arthur comes on Excalibur in the stone. At the time, John Boorman was living just a few miles down the road, at Annamoe. According to Boorman, the love scene between Lancelot and Guenevere in the forest was filmed on a very cold night, but Nicholas Clay and Cherie Lunghi performed the scene nude anyway.

According to Boorman, the film was originally three hours long; among the scenes that were deleted from the finished film, but featured in one of the promotional trailers, was a sequence where Lancelot rescued Guenevere from a forest bandit.

==Release==
The film opened in the United States on 10 April 1981 and in London on 2 July 1981, before opening nationwide in the United Kingdom on 5 July 1981. The film was initially released in the United States with an R rating. Distributors later announced a 119 minute PG-rated version, with less graphic sex and violence, but it was not widely released. When first released in the United Kingdom, the film was classified as an &quot;AA&quot; by the BBFC, restricting it to those aged 14 and over. In 1982, the BBFC replaced the &quot;AA&quot; certificate with the higher age-specific &quot;15&quot;, which was applied to &quot;Excalibur&quot; when released on home video. When &quot;Excalibur&quot; first premiered on HBO in 1982, the R-rated version was shown in the evening and the PG-rated version was shown during the daytime, following the then-current rule of HBO only showing R-rated films during the evening hours.

==Reception==
 &quot;Excalibur&quot; was the number one film in the United States during its opening weekend, eventually grossing $34,967,437 in the United States and Canada, ranking as the 18th highest-grossing film of the year. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 72% score based on 93 reviews, with an average rating of 7.0/10. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics.

Roger Ebert called it both a &quot;wondrous vision&quot; and &quot;a mess&quot;. Elaborating further, Ebert wrote that the film was &quot;a record of the comings and goings of arbitrary, inconsistent, shadowy figures who are not heroes but simply giants run amok. Still, it&#x27;s wonderful to look at&quot;. Vincent Canby wrote that while Boorman took Arthurian myths seriously, &quot;he has used them with a pretentiousness that obscures his vision.&quot; In her review in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote that the film had its own &quot;crazy integrity&quot;, adding that the imagery was &quot;impassioned&quot; with a &quot;hypnotic quality&quot;. According to her, the dialogue was &quot;near-atrocious&quot;. She concluded by writing that &quot;&quot;Excalibur&quot; is all images flashing by... We miss the dramatic intensity that we expect the stories to have, but there&#x27;s always something to look at&quot;.

Others have praised the entire film, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling it &quot;a near-perfect blend of action, romance, fantasy and philosophy&quot;. Sean Axmaker of &quot;Parallax View&quot; wrote &quot;John Boorman&#x27;s magnificent and magical Excalibur is, to my mind, the greatest and the richest screen incarnation of the oft-told tale.&quot; In a later review upon the film&#x27;s DVD release, &quot;Salon&#x27;s&quot; David Lazarus noted the film&#x27;s contribution to the fantasy genre, stating that it was &quot;a lush retelling of the King Arthur legend that sets a high-water mark among sword-and-sorcery movies&quot;. A study by Jean-Marc Elsholz demonstrates how closely the film &quot;Excalibur&quot; was inspired by the Arthurian romance tradition and its intersections with medieval theories of light, most particularly in the aesthetic/visual narrative of Boorman&#x27;s film rather than in its plot alone.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;Excalibur&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #9 and commented that &quot;&quot;Excalibur&quot; is a shockingly large film and an incredibly intricate and fascinating piece of cinema. It is a fine prologue for the spate of fantasy films waiting in the wings for release this year.&quot; The film featured many actors early in their careers who later became very well-known, including Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, and Ciarán Hinds. For his performance as Merlin, Nicol Williamson received widespread acclaim. &quot;The Times&quot; in 1981 wrote: &quot;The actors are led by Williamson&#x27;s witty and perceptive Merlin, missed every time he&#x27;s offscreen&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
== Legacy ==
The comedic 1989 teaser trailer for &quot;&quot; directly parodies the lady of the lake scene from &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

In 2009, filmmaker Zack Snyder said &quot;Excalibur&quot; was his favorite film, calling it &quot;the perfect meeting of movies and mythology&quot;. In his film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016), Bruce Wayne and his parents, Thomas and Martha, are walking home from seeing &quot;Excalibur&quot; when the latter two are killed by Joe Chill. The event later leads to Bruce becoming Batman. Moreover, the film parallels much of the film&#x27;s major plot points, most notably Superman killing Doomsday with a Kryptonite Spear at the expense of his own life intended as a homage to Arthur killing Mordred with Excalibur at the cost of his.

The 2018 adaptation of science fiction novel&quot; Ready Player One &quot;features the charm of making as an activation code.

During the shooting of the 2023 film &quot;Irati&quot;, inspired by Basque mythology and several medieval films including &quot;Excalibur&quot;, the crew nicknamed it , after , (&quot;Basque-language&quot;).

The English heavy metal band Anaal Nathrakh took its name from Merlin&#x27;s Charm of Making in this film.

===Documentaries===
Neil Jordan directed a 1981 documentary on the making of &quot;Excalibur&quot;, entitled &quot;The Making of Excalibur: Myth Into Movie&quot;. 
In 2013 another documentary entitled &quot;Behind the Sword in the Stone&quot; was released featuring interviews with director Boorman and many of the cast, such as Terry, Mirren, Stewart, Neeson, Byrne, Lunghi, and Charley Boorman. Distribution rights were later acquired by PBS International, and the title was changed to &quot;Excalibur: Behind the Movie&quot;. As of June 2020, this documentary was made available in the United States through various online streaming services.

<doc id="250701" wikidata="Q159478" url="?curid=250701" title="Wesley Clark">
<text>Wesley Kanne Clark (born Wesley J. Kanne, 23 December 1944) is a retired United States Army officer. He graduated as valedictorian of the class of 1966 at West Point and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he obtained a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He later graduated from the Command and General Staff College with a master&#x27;s degree in military science. He commanded an infantry company in the Vietnam War, where he was shot four times and awarded a Silver Star for gallantry in combat. Clark served as the Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO from 1997 to 2000, commanding Operation Allied Force during the Kosovo War. He spent 34 years in the U.S. Army, receiving many military decorations, several honorary knighthoods, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 2003, Clark launched his candidacy for the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After winning only the Oklahoma state primary, he withdrew from the race in February 2004, endorsing and campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee, John Kerry. Clark leads a political action committee, &quot;WesPAC&quot;, which he formed after the 2004 primaries and used to support Democratic Party candidates in the 2006 midterm elections. Clark was considered a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2008, but, on 15 September 2007, endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton. After Clinton dropped out of the presidential race, Clark endorsed the then-presumptive Democratic nominee, Barack Obama.

Clark has his own consulting firm, Wesley K. Clark and Associates, and is chairman and CEO of Enverra, a licensed boutique investment bank. He has worked with over 100 private and public companies on energy, security, and financial services. Clark is engaged in business in North America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. Between July 2012 and November 2015, he was an honorary special advisor to Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta on economic and security matters.

==Early life and education==
Clark&#x27;s father&#x27;s family was Jewish; his paternal grandparents, Jacob Kanne and Ida Goldman, immigrated to the United States from Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire, in response to the Pale of Settlement and anti-Jewish violence from Russian pogroms. Clark&#x27;s father, Benjamin Jacob Kanne, graduated from the Chicago-Kent College of Law and served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as an ensign during World War I, although he never participated in combat. Kanne, living in Chicago, became involved with ward politics in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices. He served as a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention that nominated Franklin D. Roosevelt as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate (though his name does not appear on the published roll of convention delegates). His mother was of English ancestry and was a Methodist.

Kanne came from the Kohen family line, and Clark&#x27;s son has characterized Clark&#x27;s parents&#x27; marriage, between his Methodist mother, Veneta (née Updegraff), and his Jewish father, Benjamin Jacob Kanne, as &quot;about as multicultural as you could&#x27;ve gotten in 1944&quot;.

Clark was born Wesley J. Kanne in Chicago on 23 December 1944. His father Benjamin died on 6 December 1948; his mother then moved the family to Little Rock, Arkansas. The move was made to escape the cost of living in the city of Chicago, for the support Veneta&#x27;s family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the religion of the Kanne family. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Victor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Victor raised Wesley as his son, and officially adopted him on Wesley&#x27;s 16th birthday. Wesley&#x27;s name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Victor Clark&#x27;s name actually replaced that of Wesley&#x27;s biological father on his birth certificate, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a Baptist church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.

He graduated from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship. He helped take their swim team to the state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay. Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided he wanted to go to West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on 24 April 1962.

==Military career==

Clark&#x27;s military career began 2 July 1962, when he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He later said that Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s famous &quot;&quot; speech was an important influence on his view of the military. The speech was given to the class of 1962 several months before Clark entered West Point, but a recording was played for his class when they first arrived.

Clark sat in the front in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in debate, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him &quot;Distinguished Cadet&quot; stars on his uniform) and graduated as valedictorian of his class. The valedictorian is allowed to choose their career specialty in the Army, and Clark selected armor. He met Gertrude Kingston (whom he later married) at a USO dance for midshipmen and West Point cadets.

Clark applied for a Rhodes Scholarship during his senior year at West Point, and learned in December 1965 that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the United States Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He completed his master&#x27;s degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) at Magdalen College at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark&#x27;s who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage, having received permission from Veneta Clark. Clark spent three months after graduation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, going through the Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to Ranger School at Fort Benning. He was promoted to captain and was assigned as commander of the A Company of the 1st Battalion, 63rd Armor, 24th Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas.

===Vietnam War===

Clark was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam in July 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK-47. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter.

Clark converted to Catholicism, his wife Gertrude&#x27;s religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., for the first time while at the Valley Forge Hospital. Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, 194th Armored Brigade, a company composed of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the eight-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1974. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was to the office of the Army Chief of Staff in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the &quot;Modern Volunteer Army&quot; program from May to July 1971. He then served as an instructor in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.

Clark graduated as the Distinguished Graduate and George C. Marshall Award winner from the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), earning his military Master of Arts degree in military science from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of gradualism in the Vietnam War. Clark&#x27;s theory was one of applying force swiftly to achieve escalation dominance, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the Weinberger Doctrine and its successor, the Powell Doctrine. Clark was promoted to major upon his graduation from the CGSC.

===Post-Vietnam War===
In 1975, Clark was appointed a White House Fellow in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a special assistant to its director, James Thomas Lynn. He was one of 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants. Lynn also gave Clark a six-week assignment to assist John Marsh, then a counselor to the president. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to Vietnam veterans. He worked with the movement that helped lead to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Clark served in two commands with the 1st Armored Division based in Germany from August 1976 to February 1978, first as S-3 of the 3rd Battalion, 35th Armor and then as S-3 for 3rd Brigade. Clark&#x27;s brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was &quot;singularly outstanding, notably superb&quot;. He was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for his work with the division.

The brigade commander had also said that &quot;word of Major Clark&#x27;s exceptional talent spread&quot;, and in one case reached the desk of then Supreme Allied Commander Alexander Haig. Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. As a result of his work on Haig&#x27;s staff, Clark was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Legion of Merit. After his European post, he moved on to Fort Carson, Colorado, where he served first as the executive officer of the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division from August 1979 to February 1980, then as the commander of the 1st Battalion, 77th Armor, 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982. According to the American journalist David Halberstam, the commander at Fort Carson, then Major General John Hudachek, had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast-rising officers such as Clark. Still, Clark was selected first in his year group for full colonel and attended the National War College immediately after his battalion command. Clark graduated in June 1983, and was promoted to full colonel in October 1983.
Following his graduation, Clark worked in Washington, D.C., from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army, earning a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at the Fort Irwin Military Reservation from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded another Legion of Merit and a Meritorious Service Medal for his work at Fort Irwin and was given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley&#x27;s mother, died of a heart attack on Mother&#x27;s Day in 1986. Regarding his term as brigade commander, one of his battalion commanders called Clark the &quot;most brilliant and gifted officer [he&#x27;d] ever known&quot;. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to use escalation training to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time. On 1 November 1989, Clark was promoted to brigadier general.

Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the National Training Center (NTC) from October 1989 to 1991. The Gulf War occurred during Clark&#x27;s command, and many National Guard divisional round-out brigades trained under his command. Multiple generals commanding American forces in Iraq and Kuwait said Clark&#x27;s training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded another Legion of Merit for his &quot;personal efforts&quot; that were &quot;instrumental in maintaining&quot; the NTC, according to the citation. He served in a planning post after this, as the deputy chief of staff for concepts, doctrine, and developments at Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) at Fort Monroe, Virginia. While there, he helped the commanding general of TRADOC prepare the army for war and develop new post-Cold War strategies. Clark pushed for technological advancement in the army to establish a digital network for military command, which he called the &quot;digitization of the battlefield&quot;. He was promoted to major general in October 1992 at the end of this command.

====Fort Hood====
Clark&#x27;s divisional command came with the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas. Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait.
His Officer Evaluation Report (OER) for his command at Fort Hood called him &quot;one of the Army&#x27;s best and brightest&quot;. Clark was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at Fort Hood and was promoted to lieutenant general at the end of his command in 1994. Clark&#x27;s next assignment was an appointment as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5), on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), from April 1994 to June 1996. In this position, he helped develop and coordinate world-wide US military policy and strategy. He participated with Richard Holbrooke in the Dayton Peace Process, which ended the Bosnian war in former Yugoslavia. During this period, he also participated in &quot;back-stopping&quot; nuclear negotiations in Korea, planning the restoration of democracy in Haiti, shifting the United States Southern Command headquarters from Panama to Miami, imposing tougher restrictions on Saddam Hussein, rewriting the National Military Strategy, and developing Joint Vision 2010 for future US war-fighting.

====United States Southern Command====
Army regulations set a so-called &quot;ticking clock&quot; upon promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within two years from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General Dennis Reimer did not want to recommend him for promotion although &quot;no specific reason was given&quot;. According to Clark&#x27;s book, General Robert H. Scales said that it was likely Clark&#x27;s reputation for intelligence was responsible for feelings of resentment from other generals. Clark was named to the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full general in June 1996, and General John M. Shalikashvili signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen &quot;hadn&#x27;t been accepted for some reason&quot;.

===Balkans===

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====

Clark began planning work for responses to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with Bosnian Serb military leaders including Ratko Mladić, who was later accused of war crimes and genocide. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the U.S. ambassador. Some Clinton administration members privately said the incident was &quot;like cavorting with Hermann Göring&quot;. Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two Congressmen called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his &quot;first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility ... and a painful few days&quot;. Conservative pundit Robert Novak later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a &quot;problem&quot; with Clark as a candidate.

Clark was sent to Bosnia by Secretary of Defense William Perry to serve as the military member to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke. Holbrooke later described Clark&#x27;s position as &quot;complicated&quot; because it presented him with future possibilities but &quot;might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers&quot;. While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week, the road gave way, and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke&#x27;s deputy, Robert Frasure, a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, Joseph Kruzel, and Air Force Colonel Nelson Drew. Following funeral services in Washington, D.C., the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the Dayton Agreement at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and later signed it in Paris on 14 December 1995.

Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his USSOUTHCOM position when he was appointed to U.S. European Command in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, he eventually received the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he &quot;had a very strong role in [Clark&#x27;s] last two jobs&quot;. Clark noted during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services committee that he believed NATO had shifted since the end of the Cold War from protecting Europe from the Soviet Union to working towards more general stability in the region. Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the School of the Americas and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some South American nations to effectively fight the War on Drugs. Clark was quickly confirmed by a voice vote the same day as his confirmation hearing, giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The position made Clark the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.

====Kosovo War====
The largest event of Clark&#x27;s tenure as SACEUR was NATO&#x27;s confrontation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Kosovo War. On 22 September 1998, the United Nations Security Council introduced Resolution 1199 calling for an end to hostilities in Kosovo, and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the Račak massacre. Then U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the Rambouillet Agreement, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was not at the Rambouillet talks. He separately tried to convince Yugoslavian president Slobodan Milošević by telling him &quot;there&#x27;s an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I&#x27;m going to bomb you good.&quot; Clark later alleged that Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against Albanians and said that they&#x27;d been &quot;handled&quot; in the 1940s by ethnic cleansing.

On orders from President Clinton, Clark started the bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on 24 March 1999, to try to enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia&#x27;s refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and did not authorize any organization to take military action. US Secretary of Defense William Cohen felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent the Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, that he was not being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as &quot;just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States&quot;. This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was initially not invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO&#x27;s 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.

Clark returned to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević&#x27;s true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said &quot;distorted the comment&quot; with headlines such as &quot;NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a &quot;complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts,&quot; and President Clinton agreed that Clark&#x27;s remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: &quot;Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That&#x27;s it.&quot;

The bombing campaign received criticism when it bombed the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters on 23 April 1999. The attack which killed sixteen civilian employees was labeled as a war crime by Amnesty International and as an act of terrorism by Noam Chomsky. NATO expressed its justification for the bombing by saying that the station operated as a propaganda tool for the Milošević regime. Operation Allied Force experienced another problem when NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade on 7 May 1999. The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets, including &quot;Target 493, the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters&quot;, although the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area. The embassy was located at this mistaken target, and three Chinese journalists were killed. Clark&#x27;s intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined, saying it was not the officer&#x27;s fault. Defense Secretary Cohen and CIA Director George Tenet took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on 22 July 1999, that the targeting system used street addresses, which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings. He also said that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location.

The bombing campaign ended on 10 June 1999, on the order of Secretary General of NATO Javier Solana after Milošević complied with conditions the international community had set and Yugoslav forces began to withdraw from Kosovo. United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 was adopted that same day, placing Kosovo under United Nations administration and authorizing a Kosovo peacekeeping force. NATO suffered no combat deaths, although two crew members died in an Apache helicopter crash. A F-117A was downed near the village of Budjanovci. The bombing resulted in an estimated 495 civilian deaths and 820 wounded, as reported to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia estimated that the number of civilians killed is higher than 2,000 and that more than 5,000 have been wounded. Human Rights Watch estimates the number of civilian deaths due to NATO bombings as somewhere between 488 and 527.

Milošević&#x27;s term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end, and the elections that came on 24 September 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on 7 October. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on 1 April 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević&#x27;s trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO&#x27;s entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.

====Incident at Pristina airport====

One of Clark&#x27;s most controversial decisions during his SACEUR command was his attempted operation at Priština International Airport immediately after the end of the Kosovo War. Russian forces had arrived in Kosovo and were heading for the airport on June 12, 1999, two days after the bombing campaign ended, expecting to help police that section of Kosovo. Clark, on the other hand, had planned for the Kosovo Force to police the area. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO, Javier Solana, and was told &quot;of course you have to get to the airport&quot; and &quot;you have transfer of authority&quot; in the area.

The British commander of the Kosovo Force, General Mike Jackson, however, refused to allow the British forces led by Captain James Blunt to block the Russians through military action saying &quot;I&#x27;m not going to start the Third World War for you.&quot; Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians, instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield. The stand-off lasted two weeks. Russian forces continued to occupy the airport, until eventually an agreement was secured for them to be integrated into peace-keeping duties, while remaining outside of NATO command.

Jackson&#x27;s refusal was criticized by some senior U.S. military personnel, with General Hugh Shelton calling it &quot;troubling&quot;. During hearings in the United States Senate, Senator John Warner suggested that the refusal might have been illegal, and that if it was legal, rules potentially should be changed. Still, British Chief of the Defence Staff Charles Guthrie agreed with Jackson. Clark was subsequently ordered to step down from his position two months earlier than expected. Jackson continued his career after the Pristina Incident: He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (1998), received the Distinguished Service Order (1999), became Commander-in-Chief, Land Command (2000), and finally, in 2003, Chief of the General Staff, the highest position in the British Army.

===Retirement===
Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was surprised by this, because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was told that this was necessary because General Joseph Ralston was leaving his post as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston was not going to be appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation &quot;didn&#x27;t wash&quot;; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston&#x27;s reassignment, although David Halberstam wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark&#x27;s treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on 2 May 2000.

Rumors persisted that Clark was forced out due to his contentious relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a &quot;routine personnel action&quot;. The Department of Defense said it was merely a &quot;general rotation of American senior ranks&quot;. However, a NATO ambassador told the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; that Clark&#x27;s dismissal seemed to be a &quot;political thing from the United States&quot;. General Shelton, working for the competing presidential campaign of John Edwards in 2003–2004, said of Clark during his 2004 campaign that &quot;the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I&#x27;m not going to say whether I&#x27;m a Republican or a Democrat. I&#x27;ll just say Wes won&#x27;t get my vote.&quot; Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.

==Civilian career==
Clark was chairman of the investment bank Rodman Renshaw, which filed for bankruptcy. The bank&#x27;s questionable practices and Clark&#x27;s direct role were detailed in the hit documentary film &quot;The China Hustle&quot;. 
Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty&#x27;s advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with Stephens Inc, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left Stephens Inc to found Wesley K. Clark &amp; Associates. Clark wrote two books, &quot;Waging Modern War&quot; and &quot;Winning Modern Wars&quot;. He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. In 2021 he published academic article Hybrid Warfare and the Challenge of Cyberattacks in The Challenge to NATO: Global Security and the Atlantic Alliance.

Clark had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.

Clark is also a member of the Atlantic Council&#x27;s board of directors.

===2004 presidential campaign===
Clark has said that he began to truly define his politics only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were &quot;starting to go wrong&quot; with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration&#x27;s War in Afghanistan in response to the 9/11 attacks but did not support the Iraq War.

Clark met with a group of wealthy New York Democrats including Alan Patricof to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of Al Gore in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004. Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and Ronald Reagan, held equal esteem for Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman, and was a registered independent voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because &quot;I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education ... I&#x27;m pro-health care ... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I was going to be a happy Democrat.&quot; Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for &quot;internationalism&quot;, &quot;ordinary men and women&quot;, and &quot;fair play&quot;.

A &quot;Draft Clark&quot; campaign began to grow with the launch of DraftWesleyClark.com on 10 April 2003. The organization signed up tens of thousands of volunteers, made 150 media appearances discussing Clark, and raised $1.5 million in pledges for his campaign. A different website, DraftClark2004.com, was the first organization to register as a political action committee in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run. They had presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking him to run. One of DraftClark2004&#x27;s founders, Brent Blackaby, said of the draft effort: &quot;Just fifty-two years ago citizens from all over the country were successful in their efforts to draft General Eisenhower. We intend to do the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark. If he runs, he wins.&quot;

In June 2003, Clark said that he was &quot;seriously consider[ing]&quot; running for president in an appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;.
Clark announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential primary elections from Little Rock on 17 September 2003, months after the other candidates. He acknowledged the influence of the Draft Clark movement, saying they &quot;took an inconceivable idea and made it conceivable&quot;. The campaign raised $3.5 million in the first two weeks. The internet campaign would also establish the Clark Community Network of blogs, which remains in use and made heavy use of Meetup.com, where DraftWesleyClark.com had established the second-largest community of Meetups at the time.

Clark&#x27;s loyalty to the Democratic Party was questioned by some as soon as he entered the race. Senator Joe Lieberman called Clark&#x27;s party choice a matter of &quot;political convenience, not conviction&quot;. Republican governor Bill Owens of Colorado and University of Denver president Marc Holtzman have claimed Clark once said &quot;I would have been a Republican if Karl Rove had returned my phone calls.&quot; Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered &quot;very directly&quot; and &quot;wasn&#x27;t a joke&quot;. Katharine Q. Seelye wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was &quot;the only party that did not have a nominee&quot;. On 11 May 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the Pulaski County Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was &quot;very glad we&#x27;ve got the great team in office, men like Colin Powell, Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Paul O&#x27;Neill—people I know very well—our president George W. Bush&quot;. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican.

Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new universal health care system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse &quot;scaled down rules&quot; the Bush administration had applied to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and dealing with the potential effects of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, livestock flatulence and other sources. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the PATRIOT Act, and investing $100 billion in homeland security. Finally, he released a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the Iraq War with other nations, and cutting government waste.

Some have speculated that Clark&#x27;s inexperience at giving &quot;soundbite&quot; answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, he was asked if he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, &quot;At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that&#x27;s too simple a question,&quot; then &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I would have or not. I&#x27;ve said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it.&quot; Finally, Clark&#x27;s press secretary clarified his position as &quot;you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution.&quot; After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a story with the headline &quot;Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War&quot;. Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can&#x27;t get their own story straight ... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it&#x27;s been a huge strategic mistake for this country.&quot;

Another media incident started during the New Hampshire primary 27 September 2003, when Clark was asked by Space Shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded he was a great believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. &quot;I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I&#x27;d like to know what&#x27;s out there beyond the solar system.&quot; Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then at the end of his remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said &quot;I still believe in . But I can&#x27;t believe that in all of human history we&#x27;ll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I&#x27;ve argued with physicists about it. I&#x27;ve argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It&#x27;s my only faith-based initiative.&quot; These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as &quot;Beam Us Up, General Clark&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition&quot; in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;General Relativity (Retired)&quot; on the U.S. News &amp; World Report website, and &quot;Clark Campaigns at Light Speed&quot; in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.
Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in first place in the presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to &quot;integrity and character issues&quot;—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and Dick Gephardt garnered results far lower than expected, and John Kerry and John Edwards&#x27; campaigns benefited in Clark&#x27;s absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on 11 February 2004, and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on 13 February. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign&#x27;s biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that &quot;everything would have been different if we had [been in Iowa].&quot;

===Post-2004 campaign===
Clark continued to speak in support of Kerry (and the eventual Kerry/Edwards ticket) throughout the remainder of the 2004 presidential campaign, including speaking at the 2004 Democratic National Convention on the final evening. He founded a political action committee, WesPAC, in April 2004. Fox News Channel announced in June 2005 that they had signed General Clark as a military and foreign affairs analyst. He joined the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA as a senior fellow. A managing partner of the companies that support the center, Ronald Burkle, described Clark&#x27;s position as &quot;illuminat[ing] the center&#x27;s research&quot; and &quot;teaching [the] contemporary role of the United States in the international community&quot;.

Clark campaigned heavily throughout the 2006 midterm election campaign, supporting numerous Democrats in a variety of federal, statewide, and state legislature campaigns. Ultimately his PAC aided 42 Democratic candidates who won their elections, including 25 who won seats formerly held by Republicans and 6 newly elected veteran members of the House and Senate. Clark was the most-requested surrogate of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee throughout the 2006 campaign, and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues.

Clark has opposed taking military action against Iran and in January 2007 he criticized what he called &quot;New York money people&quot; pushing for a war. This led to accusations of antisemitism.

In September 2007 Clark&#x27;s memoir &quot;A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country&quot;. In the book Clark alleged that during a visit to the Pentagon in the autumn of 2001 after 9/11, a &quot;senior general&quot; told him that the Office of the Secretary of Defense had produced a confidential paper proposing a series of regime change operations in seven countries over a period of five years. He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that &quot;...we did learn one thing that&#x27;s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won&#x27;t come in to block us. And we&#x27;ve got five, maybe 10, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us...&quot;.

Clark serves on the Advisory Boards of the Global Panel Foundation and the National Security Network. He is also the chairman of Enverra, and was also chairman of Rodman &amp; Renshaw, a New York investment bank, and Growth Energy. His chairmanship at Rodman &amp; Renshaw is part of the documentary The China Hustle. Clark is interviewed about his involvement in selling toxic stocks of unregulated Chinese companies; eventually though, he exits the interview to avoid association with Rodman &amp; Renshaw, which went bankrupt in 2013. The film speculates that the company used his name as chairman to gain legitimacy for its operations.

===Tiversa===
In July 2007, Clark testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability about the discovery of classified information on file-sharing networks by the cybersecurity firm Tiversa, where he served on the board of advisers.

===Speculation of 2008 presidential campaign===

Clark was mentioned as a potential 2008 presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket before endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. Before that time, he was ranked within the top Democratic candidates according to some Internet polls. After endorsing Hillary Clinton, Clark campaigned for her in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Ohio and in campaign commercials. There are many reports that Clinton had already decided to choose Clark to be her running mate had she won the nomination. The Clinton campaign even considered picking Clark as a running mate with the team running together in the primaries, though the idea was later abandoned. After Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination, Clark voiced his support for Obama. Clark was considered to be one of Obama&#x27;s possible vice-presidential running mates. Clark, however, publicly endorsed Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius for the position, introducing her as &quot;the next Vice President of the United States&quot; at a June 2008 fundraiser in Texas. Obama eventually chose Joe Biden as his running mate.

===McCain military service controversy===
On 29 June 2008, Clark made comments on &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that were critical of Republican John McCain, calling into question the notion that McCain&#x27;s military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. &quot;I certainly honor [McCain&#x27;s] service as a prisoner of war&quot;, Clark said, &quot;but he hasn&#x27;t held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn&#x27;t a wartime squadron. He hasn&#x27;t been in there and ordered the bombs to fall.&quot; When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he &quot;ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down&quot;, Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark&#x27;s retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain&#x27;s military experience, he stated: &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president.&quot; Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark&#x27;s comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark&#x27;s comments were &quot;inartful&quot; and were not intended to attack McCain&#x27;s military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain&#x27;s military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honored McCain&#x27;s service, he had serious concerns about McCain&#x27;s judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain &quot;untested and untried&quot;.

===Book on modern wars===
In Clark&#x27;s book &quot;Winning Modern Wars&quot;, published in 2003, he describes his conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack seven countries in five years: &quot;As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran.&quot; Clark regards the 2003 invasion of Iraq as &quot;a huge mistake&quot;.

===Paradise Papers===
On 5 November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that online gambling company The Stars Group, then Amaya, along with its former member of board of directors Wesley Clark, did business with offshore law firm Appleby.

===Reality television career===
Clark was the host of &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot;, a reality television program that aired on NBC for four episodes in 2012. The program followed celebrities who competed in challenges based on U.S. military exercises.

==Awards and honors==

Wesley Clark has been awarded numerous honors, awards, and knighthoods over the course of his military and civilian career. Notable military awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, the Legion of Merit with three oak leaf clusters, the Silver Star, and the Bronze Star with an oak leaf cluster.

Clark has been awarded some honors as a civilian, such as the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, in 1998, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000. The people of Gjakova, Kosovo, named a street after him for his role in helping their city and country. The city of Madison in Alabama has also named a boulevard after Clark. Municipal approval has been granted for the construction of a new street to be named &quot;General Clark Court&quot; in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
He has also been appointed a Fellow at the Burkle Center for International Relations at UCLA. He is a member of the guiding coalition of the Project on National Security Reform.

<doc id="250706" wikidata="Q20823352" url="?curid=250706" title="Rosy starling">
<text>The rosy starling (Pastor roseus) is a passerine bird in the starling family, Sturnidae, also known as the rose-coloured starling or rose-coloured pastor. The species was recently placed in its own monotypic genus, Pastor, and split from &quot;Sturnus&quot;. This split is supported by recent studies, though other related species within its new genus are not yet known for certain.

==Taxonomy==
The rosy starling was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus roseus&quot;. Linnaeus gave the type locality as Lapland and Switzerland. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Pastor&quot; that was introduced by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1815. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name and the old English name come from the Latin &quot;pastor&quot; meaning &quot;shepherd&quot;, and by extension a pastor. The specific &quot;roseus&quot; is Latin for &quot;rose-coloured&quot;.

Formerly, some authorities also considered the maroon oriole to be a species within the genus &quot;Pastor&quot;.

==Description==

The adult rosy starling is highly distinctive, with its pink body, pale orange legs and bill, and glossy black head, wings and tail. Males in the breeding season have elongated head feathers which form a wispy crest that is fluffed and more prominent when the bird gets excited. In winter, the crest is shorter, and the edges of black feathers within the plumage become paler as the edges of these feather erode. Winter plumage in males is comparatively dull.

Females in contrast have a short crest and lack the sharp separation between pink and black.

The juvenile birds can be distinguished from common starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) by its obviously paler plumage and short yellow bill. Young birds moult into a subdued version of the adult plumage in autumn, yet these lack the crest. They do not acquire their adult plumage until they are nearly one year old in females, and nearly two years in males. The latter grow plumage very similar to adult females in their second year, but are distinguished by longer crests and noticeably pale feather edges than female juvenile birds.

==Distribution and habitat==

The breeding range of this bird is in steppes, semi-deserts and deserts of Central Asia and Southeast Europe. It can be found from northwestern Mongolia via Dzungarei, Xinjiang, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to southern Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Its southern range extends to the north of Afghanistan and Iran. Irregular and rare broods are also observed outside of this area (Romania). It is a strong migrant, and winters in India and tropical Asia. In India in winter, it often appears to outnumber the local starlings and mynas. The rosy starling is a bird of steppe and open agricultural land. In years when grasshoppers and other insects are abundant, it will irrupt well beyond its core range, with significant numbers reaching France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. The starling is a summer visitor for northwestern Afghanistan, passage migrants in the rest of the Afghanistan and a regular winter visitor in India.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Rosy starlings (&quot;Pastor roseus&quot;) are highly gregarious birds, and often form large, noisy flocks, which can on occasion be a pest for growers of cereal crops or orchards; the birds are strongly attracted to flowering trees. However, they are also greatly beneficial to farmers because they prey on pests such as locusts and grasshoppers, thereby limiting their numbers. The birds breed in tight colonies in a very short breeding season timed to take advantage of peak abundance of grasshoppers between months of May to June.
===Breeding===
The rosy starling is a colonial breeder, and like other starlings, is highly gregarious, forming large winter flocks. It also shares other species&#x27; omnivorous diet, although it prefers insects. 
The song is a typical starling mixture of squeaks and rattles, given with much wing trembling. 
In Xinjiang, China, farmers used to use insecticide to eliminate locust, which is costly and polluting. In the 1980s, experts found that rosy starlings which fly to Xinjiang farms and feed on locusts could be used for control instead. The experts begin to build artificial nests to attract rosy starlings, an effort reported to be so successful that the number of locusts was insufficient to feed the birds, causing many juveniles to die from hunger. By the 2000s many Xinjiang farms greatly decreased the usage of insecticide.
===Food and feeding===

The rosy starling feeds chiefly on fruits, berries, flower-nectar, cereal grains and insects. 
Specific observations of preferred food types made on the feeding habits of rosy starling are listed as:
Fruits and berries: &quot;Ficus&quot; (many species), &quot;Lantana&quot; spp., &quot;Ziziphus oenopolia&quot;, &quot;Bridelia montana&quot;, &quot;Streblus asper&quot;, grapes, mulberries (&quot;Morus&quot;), dates, &quot;Salvadora persica&quot;, &quot;Capparis aphylla&quot; and chillies.
Flower-nectar: &quot;Salmalia persica&quot;, &quot;Bombax insigne&quot;, &quot;Erythrina indica&quot; and &quot;Erythrina suberosa&quot;, &quot;Butea monosperma&quot;, &quot;Careya arborea&quot;.
Cereal grains: Jowar and bajra.
Insects: largely locusts and grasshoppers, beetles of the families Lucanidae, Elateridae, Tenebrionidae, Buprestidae, Scarabaeidae and Curculionidae.

<text>An induction coil or &quot;spark coil&quot; (archaically known as an inductorium or Ruhmkorff coil after Heinrich Rühmkorff) is a type of transformer used to produce high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current (DC) supply. To create the flux changes necessary to induce voltage in the secondary coil, the direct current in the primary coil is repeatedly interrupted by a vibrating mechanical contact called an interrupter. Invented in 1836 by the Irish-Catholic priest Nicholas Callan, also independently by American inventor Charles Grafton Page, the induction coil was the first type of transformer. It was widely used in x-ray machines, spark-gap radio transmitters, arc lighting and quack medical electrotherapy devices from the 1880s to the 1920s. Today its only common use is as the ignition coils in internal combustion engines and in physics education to demonstrate induction.

==Construction and function==

An induction coil consists of two coils of insulated wire wound around a common iron core &quot;(M)&quot;. One coil, called the &quot;primary winding&quot; &quot;(P)&quot;, is made from relatively few (tens or hundreds) turns of coarse wire. The other coil, the &quot;secondary winding,&quot; &quot;(S)&quot; typically consists of up to a million turns of fine wire (up to 40 gauge).

An electric current is passed through the primary, creating a magnetic field. Because of the common core, most of the primary&#x27;s magnetic field couples with the secondary winding. The primary behaves as an inductor, storing energy in the associated magnetic field. When the primary current is suddenly interrupted, the magnetic field rapidly collapses. This causes a high voltage pulse to be developed across the secondary terminals through electromagnetic induction. Because of the large number of turns in the secondary coil, the secondary voltage pulse is typically many thousands of volts. This voltage is often sufficient to cause an electric spark, to jump across an air gap &quot;(G)&quot; separating the secondary&#x27;s output terminals. For this reason, induction coils were called spark coils.

An induction coil is traditionally characterised by the length of spark it can produce; a &#x27;4 inch&#x27; (10 cm) induction coil could produce a 4 inch spark. Until the development of the cathode ray oscilloscope, this was the most reliable measurement of peak voltage of such asymmetric waveforms. The relationship between spark length and voltage is linear within a wide range:
: = 110kV; = 150kV; = 190kV; = 230kV

Curves supplied by a 1984 reference agree closely with those values.

===Interrupter===
To operate the coil continually, the DC supply current must be repeatedly connected and disconnected to create the magnetic field changes needed for induction. To do that, induction coils use a magnetically activated vibrating arm called an &quot;interrupter&quot; or &quot;break&quot; (&quot;A&quot;) to rapidly connect and break the current flowing into the primary coil. The interrupter is mounted on the end of the coil next to the iron core. When the power is turned on, the increasing current in the primary coil produces an increasing magnetic field, the magnetic field attracts the interrupter&#x27;s iron armature (&quot;A&quot;). After a time, the magnetic attraction overcomes the armature&#x27;s spring force, and the armature begins to move. When the armature has moved far enough, the pair of contacts (&quot;K&quot;) in the primary circuit open and disconnect the primary current. Disconnecting the current causes the magnetic field to collapse and create the spark. Also, the collapsed field no longer attracts the armature, so the spring force accelerates the armature toward its initial position. A short time later the contacts reconnect, and the current starts building the magnetic field again. The whole process starts over and repeats many times per second. The secondary voltage (red, left), is roughly proportional to the rate of change of primary current (blue).

Opposite potentials are induced in the secondary when the interrupter &#x27;breaks&#x27; the circuit and &#x27;closes&#x27; the circuit. However, the current change in the primary is much more abrupt when the interrupter &#x27;breaks&#x27;. When the contacts close, the current builds up slowly in the primary because the supply voltage has a limited ability to force current through the coil&#x27;s inductance. In contrast, when the interrupter contacts open, the current falls to zero suddenly. So the pulse of voltage induced in the secondary at &#x27;break&#x27; is much larger than the pulse induced at &#x27;close&#x27;, it is the &#x27;break&#x27; that generates the coil&#x27;s high voltage output.

===Capacitor===
An arc forms at the interrupter contacts on break which has undesirable effects: the arc consumes energy stored in the magnetic field, reduces the output voltage, and damages the contacts. To prevent this, a quenching capacitor &quot;(C)&quot; of 0.5 to 15 μF is connected across the primary coil to slow the rise in the voltage after a break. The capacitor and primary winding together form a tuned circuit, so on break, a damped sinusoidal wave of current flows in the primary and likewise induces a damped wave in the secondary. As a result, the high voltage output consists of a series of damped waves &quot;(left)&quot;.

===Construction details===
To prevent the high voltages generated in the coil from breaking down the thin insulation and arcing between the secondary wires, the secondary coil uses special construction so as to avoid having wires carrying large voltage differences lying next to each other. In one widely used technique, the secondary coil is wound in many thin flat pancake-shaped sections (called &quot;pies&quot;), connected in series.

The primary coil is first wound on the iron core and insulated from the secondary with a thick paper or rubber coating. Then each secondary subcoil is connected to the coil next to it and slid onto the iron core, insulated from adjoining coils with waxed cardboard disks. The voltage developed in each subcoil isn&#x27;t large enough to jump between the wires in the subcoil. Large voltages are only developed across many subcoils in series, which are too widely separated to arc over. To give the entire coil a final insulating coating, it is immersed in melted paraffin wax or rosin; the air evacuated to ensure there are no air bubbles left inside and the paraffin allowed to solidify, so the entire coil is encased in wax.
To prevent eddy currents, which cause energy losses, the iron core is made of a bundle of parallel iron wires, individually coated with shellac to insulate them electrically. The eddy currents, which flow in loops in the core perpendicular to the magnetic axis, are blocked by the layers of insulation. The ends of the insulated primary coil often protruded several inches from either end of the secondary coil, to prevent arcs from the secondary to the primary or the core.

==Mercury and electrolytic interrupters==
Although modern induction coils used for educational purposes all use the vibrating arm &#x27;hammer&#x27; type interrupter described above, these were inadequate for powering the large induction coils used in spark-gap radio transmitters and x-ray machines around the turn of the 20th century. In powerful coils the high primary current created arcs at the interrupter contacts which quickly destroyed the contacts. Also, since each &quot;break&quot; produces a pulse of voltage from the coil, the more breaks per second the greater the power output. Hammer interrupters were not capable of interruption rates over 200 breaks per second and the ones used on powerful coils were limited to 20 – 40 breaks per second.

Therefore much research went into improving interrupters and improved designs were used in high power coils, with the hammer interrupters only used on small coils under 8&quot; sparks. Léon Foucault and others developed interrupters consisting of an oscillating needle dipping into and out of a container of mercury. The mercury was covered with a layer of spirits which extinguished the arc quickly, causing faster switching. These were often driven by a separate electromagnet or motor, which allowed the interruption rate and &quot;dwell&quot; time to be adjusted separately from the primary current.

The largest coils used either electrolytic or mercury turbine interrupters. The electrolytic or Wehnelt interrupter, invented by Arthur Wehnelt in 1899, consisted of a short platinum needle anode immersed in an electrolyte of dilute sulfuric acid, with the other side of the circuit connected to a lead plate cathode. When the primary current passed through it, hydrogen gas bubbles formed on the needle which repeatedly broke the circuit. This resulted in a primary current broken randomly at rates up to 2000 breaks per second. They were preferred for powering X-ray tubes. They produced a lot of heat and due to this the hydrogen could explode. Mercury turbine interrupters had a centrifugal pump which sprayed a stream of liquid mercury onto rotating metal contacts. They could achieve interruption rates up to 10,000 breaks per second and were the most widely used type of interrupter in commercial wireless stations.

==History==


The induction coil was the first type of electrical transformer. During its development between 1836 and the 1860s, mostly by trial and error, researchers discovered many of the principles that governed all transformers, such as the proportionality between turns and output voltage and the use of a &quot;divided&quot; iron core to reduce eddy current losses.

Michael Faraday discovered the principle of induction, Faraday&#x27;s induction law, in 1831 and did the first experiments with induction between coils of wire. The induction coil was invented by the American physician Charles Grafton Page in 1836 and independently by Irish scientist and Catholic priest Nicholas Callan in the same year at the St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and improved by William Sturgeon. George Henry Bachhoffner and Sturgeon (1837) independently discovered that a &quot;divided&quot; iron core of iron wires reduced power losses. The early coils had hand cranked interrupters, invented by Callan and Antoine Philibert Masson (1837). The automatic &#x27;hammer&#x27; interrupter was invented by Rev. Prof. James William MacGauley (1838) of Dublin, Ireland, Johann Philipp Wagner (1839), and Christian Ernst Neeff (1847). Hippolyte Fizeau (1853) introduced the use of the quenching capacitor. Heinrich Ruhmkorff generated higher voltages by greatly increasing the length of the secondary, in some coils using 5 or 6 miles (10 km) of wire and produced sparks up to 16 inches. In the early 1850s, American inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie introduced the divided secondary construction to improve insulation. Jonathan Nash Hearder worked on induction coils. Callan&#x27;s induction coil was named an IEEE Milestone in 2006.

Induction coils were used to provide high voltage for early gas discharge and Crookes tubes and other high voltage research. They were also used to provide entertainment (lighting Geissler tubes, for example) and to drive small &quot;shocking coils&quot;, Tesla coils and violet ray devices used in quack medicine. They were used by Hertz to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves, as predicted by James Clerk Maxwell and by Lodge and Marconi in the first research into radio waves. Their largest industrial use was probably in early wireless telegraphy spark-gap radio transmitters and to power early cold cathode x-ray tubes from the 1890s to the 1920s, after which they were supplanted in both these applications by AC transformers and vacuum tubes. However their largest use was as the ignition coil or spark coil in the ignition system of internal combustion engines, where they are still used, although the interrupter contacts are now replaced by solid state switches. A smaller version is used to trigger the flash tubes used in cameras and strobe lights.

<text>Sowerby () is a village, electoral ward and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England immediately south of the neighbouring market town of Thirsk. Although the boundary between the two parishes runs very close to Thirsk town centre, the village retains its own identity and has a separate Parish Council. The author James Herriot lived in the village.

==History==

The lines of a Roman road can still be seen in the fields to the north and east of the village along the Green Lane and was known as the Saxty Way.

The village is mentioned twice in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Sorebi&quot; in the Yarlestre wapentake. The land was split across both the head manors of Easingwold and Newsham. At the time of the Norman invasion, the manors were split between Earl Morcar and Ligulf, who granted land to Orm. Afterwards, the lands became Crown property. The overlordship was granted to the Mowbray family, who granted land to William Lascelles in 1228. The Lascelles family held their manor until 1602, when it was sold to the Meynell family. The manor has followed the inheritance of the manor at North Kilvington since then. William de Vescy of Kildare held a mesne lordship in the area in the 14th century.

Sowerby has maintained its own parish identity, a sense of place that has waxed and waned due to proximity to a market town. The surviving parish registers date from 1569. During the mid to late 19th century, when wapentakes and hundreds across England and Wales were becoming ill-fitted to administering poor laws, sanitary districts and the administration of justice, some innovations were tried. In the wapentake of Birdforth, some villages near Thirsk were more closely coordinated. Sowerby was ranked as a chapelry, in the parish and union of Thirsk, in the 19th century administration of the wapentake of Birdforth, which is why the parish does not appear on some simplified maps of that time. Eventually the wapentake became inactive as other administrative bodies were implemented, thus Sowerby parish council could be focused on specific needs and issues.
The Lascelles (Lassels) family were also credited with building a terrace of houses at the north end of the village, still known as Blue (or Bribery) Terrace, since tenants were expected to vote for the candidate who supported the Tory cause. Historically, and until its abolition in 1974, Sowerby was part of the North Riding of Yorkshire for administrative purpose. At the same time the former Thirsk Rural District Council, of which Sowerby was also a part, was itself abolished.

Sowerby&#x27;s name comes from the Norse language, in which it means &#x27;Farmstead (by the) muddy/sour ground&#x27;.

In the south of the parish at Blakey Lane, Cod Beck is crossed by Blakey Bridge, a 17th-century cart or packhorse bridge and Grade II listed building. Further south, Cod Beck is crossed again on South Moor Lane by Town End Bridge, another 17th-century packhorse bridge, also Grade II Listed.

An artificial mound known as Pudding Pie Hill is on the east bank of Cod Beck, just off Blakey Lane. This was partially excavated in 1855 (by Lady Frankland Russell) and was found to be a sepulchral tumulus of a type known as a bowl barrow. The remains of a Saxon warrior and two other skeletons were discovered, along with cremated bones, various artefacts and coins.

There are five war memorials in Sowerby, one outside St Oswald&#x27;s Church and two each inside St Oswald&#x27;s Church and Sowerby Methodist Church, listing 63 local men who died in the First World War and 18 who died in the Second World War.

Planning permission was given in 2012 for the building of a new housing estate of over 1,000 homes, called Sowerby Gateway, at the southern end of the village, resulting in a vastly increased demand for infrastructure and additional services. As a result a new supermarket has been opened as part of the development, along with an Extra Care Home, a new primary school, retail units, a hotel and a new Sports Village. There is also a new industrial/commercial estate being developed immediately adjacent to the residential area to provide additional employment opportunities. The whole development is expected to be completed by 2022. As part of the &quot;planning gain&quot; from the development a new four-way junction was completed in 2019, to replace an existing two-way junction, giving full northbound as well as southbound access to the Thirsk By-pass (A168) dual carriageway.

==Governance==

The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Sowerby electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and was part of the Sowerby ward of Hambleton District Council. The first tier of local government covering Sowerby is Sowerby Parish Council, which was first elected following the Local Government Act of 1894. Currently the Council has eleven members, who are subject to election every four years. The Council meets monthly in Thirsk and Sowerby Town Hall.

==Geography==

The boundary of the civil parish runs from the A168/A19 junction north to the Moor Lane Stell. From here it runs west, crossing Cod Beck and down Chapel Lane to then follow the A61 as far as Millbank Court. Here it runs south of the housing to cross the East Coast Main Line and then runs south to the boundary of Topcliffe airfield. It then runs east to include most of the small hamlet of Thorpefield and on to Ox Moor plantation. The boundary then follows the southerly route of the Cod Beck as far as, but not including, the hamlet of Westholme. It returns northwards to encompass Sowerby Parks to the A19 at Mile House and then to the A168/A19 junction. Paradise Beck lies wholly within the parish and joins Cod Beck near Sowerby Parks Farm.

The centre of the village has an avenue of English lime trees on Front Street, planted to celebrate the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. To the east of the village is a publicly owned open pasture and recreation area known as the Sowerby Flatts. The fields show rig and furrow cultivation marks (i.e. dug with a spade rather than a plough) and the river shows signs of the abandoned project (started c. 1768) to build a canal from the centre of Thirsk to connect with the River Swale.

===Demography===

The 1881 UK Census recorded the population as 1,743. The 2001 UK Census recorded the population as 3,699 in 1,529 households. Of the total population, 48.3% were male and 51.7% were female with 2,851 being more than sixteen years old. There were 1,585 dwellings of which 493 were detached. The 2011 UK Census recorded the population as 4,249 in 1,808 households.

===Education===

The primary schools in the village are Sowerby Primary Academy and All Saints Roman Catholic Primary School. Sowerby Primary Academy was originally opened as a National School in 1872 in a building on Front Street but that building has now been converted into private housing. Its current premises on Topcliffe Road were opened in 1919 to house Thirsk Grammar School. When the Grammar School moved out in 1957 the premises were taken over by Sowerby Junior School. In 1980, following the closure of Sowerby Infants School, which was still located in the former National School on Front Street, the Junior and Infants Schools were merged on the Topcliffe Road site to form Sowerby County Primary School.

Thirsk School and Sixth Form College, the secondary school for the town and the surrounding rural area, is located in Sowerby and has around 1,100 pupils. Its catchment area covers Alanbrooke, All Saints RC, Baldersby St James CE, Carlton Miniott, Dishforth CE, Pickhill CE, Sessay CE, South Kilvington CE, Sowerby, Thirsk and Topcliffe CE Primary Schools and includes some areas served by Knayton CE Primary School. The school was established in 1957 by the then North Riding County Council, as Thirsk Grammar and Modern School, to provide secondary education in Thirsk, Sowerby and the surrounding district. It became Thirsk School in 1970 and is now organised as an 11-18 mixed comprehensive secondary school. From 2004 it was renamed Thirsk School and Sixth Form College.

===Economy===

The area&#x27;s main industry is farming, although many people commute to nearby towns and cities for employment. There is significant employment in retail and in the public sector through Education, the Community Library, the Leisure Centre, local Health and Care Services and the Household Waste Recycling Centre. There are in addition many small and medium-sized businesses. The village also serves the local tourist industry, with holiday cottages, a hotel, bed and breakfast providers and a touring caravan site just to the south of the village.

Amenities include a pub/restaurant, The Crown and Anchor, which is a Grade II Listed building. 
Also within the parish bounds is the volunteer-run Ritz Cinema in Westgate. It was opened as a picture house in 1912 by Walter Power after converting the building from the original 19th-century Mechanics&#x27; Institute. After closing in the early 1970s, it was re-opened in 1983. There was another brief closure between 1994 and 1995. It has a seating capacity of 215.

==Religion==

The parish church of St Oswald dates from about 1140. In 1145, Roger de Mowbray gave the care of the chapel at Sowerby to the Prior of Newburgh and historical records show that several members of the Lascelles family are buried here. The structure was rebuilt in 1842 and 1883 to accommodate a growing population. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built on Front Street in 1865, with a school added in 1871.
==Notable residents==

* The educationalist, John Rowntree, father of York-based cocoa and chocolate manufacturer Joseph Rowntree, was educated at a Quaker school in the village.
* Labour M.P., member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, trades union activist and National Vice-President of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers, local councillor and magistrate Joan Maynard lived and died here.
* The author James Herriot (pen name of Alf Wight) lived at a house in Topcliffe Road.
* Ralph Bell (died 1733), MP for Thirsk 1710–17.

<text>The white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) is a passerine bird of the New World sparrow family Passerellidae. It breeds in northern North America and winters in the southern United States.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the white-throated sparrow in the second volume of his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. He used the current English name. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a &quot;neat drawing in colours&quot; supplied by the American naturalist William Bartram from Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1789 he included the white-throated sparrow. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla albicollis&quot;. The white-throated sparrow is now one of five American sparrows placed in the genus &quot;Zonotrichia&quot; that was introduced by William Swainson in 1832. The genus name is from Ancient Greek ζωνη (&quot;zōnē&quot;) meaning &quot;band&quot; and θριξ (&quot;thrix&quot;), τριχος (&quot;trikhos&quot;) meaning &quot;hair&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;albicollis&quot; combines Latin &quot;albus&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; with Modern Latin &quot;-collis&quot; meaning &quot;necked&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The white-throated sparrow is a passerine bird of the New World sparrow family Passerellidae. It measures in length with a wingspan of . Typical weight is , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . They are similar in appearance to the white-crowned sparrow, but with white throat markings and yellow lores.

There are two adult plumage variations known as the tan-striped and white-striped forms. On the white-striped form the crown is black with a white central stripe. The supercilium is white as well. The auriculars are gray with the upper edge forming a black eye line.

On the tan form, the crown is dark brown with a tan central stripe. The supercilium is tan as well. The auriculars are gray/light brown with the upper edge forming a brown eye line. Both variations feature dark eyes, a white throat, yellow lores and gray bill. There is variation and some individuals may show dark lateral stripes of each side of the throat.

They almost always pair with the opposite color morph for breeding. The two color morphs occur in approximately equal numbers. Both male and female white-striped birds are more aggressive than tan-striped birds during the breeding season. The aggression is linked to an increased rate of estrogen receptor alpha expression in white-striped birds.

The breast has gray/tan streaks and the streaks continue down the flanks but the belly is generally light gray. The wings are rufous with two distinct white wing bars. Sexes are morphologically similar.

==Behavior==

===Breeding===
White-throated sparrows breed in central Canada and New England. They nest either on the ground under shrubs or low in trees in deciduous or mixed forest areas and lay three to five brown-marked blue or green-white eggs.

The tan and white morphs of white-throated sparrows use different reproductive strategies. Tan males invest in parental care and guard their mates from others searching for extra pair copulations (EPCs). White males invest in securing additional mates and EPCs through song advertisement and intruding into neighboring territory. Female morphs have similar differences, where tan females invest in parental care and white females solicit EPCs and engage in brood parasitism, leaving their eggs in another&#x27;s nest to be raised and fed. Mating with the opposite morphs and using alternative reproductive strategies helps maintain competitive equilibrium. This behaviour has been described genetically to follow from the chromosomal inversion of a supergene which acts as an extra pair of sex-determining genes, resulting in four phenotypes that reproduce in a disassortative mating pattern.

===Wintering and migration===
In winter, this species migrates to the southern and eastern United States. They are differential migrants with females migrating farther, increasing the proportion of females at lower latitudes in the Atlantic flyway. Females are smaller so they would not perform as optimally at colder, higher latitudes, and females avoid competition with the dominant males of the winter hierarchies by migrating farther. There is also no benefit for females to be among the first to return after winter, so migrating farther allows the males to return and establish territory a few weeks before their arrival. It stays year round in the Atlantic provinces of Canada. This bird is a rare vagrant to western Europe. Alongside some other species such as the cardinal, dark-eyed junco, song sparrow and chickadees, this species ranks among the most abundant native birds during winter in eastern North America.

Despite a high level of conspecific rivalry within white-throated sparrows, this species is often dominated by other seed-eating winter residents, even those that are no larger than itself like the song sparrow, and thus may endure high levels of predation while foraging since restricted to sub-optimal sites at times by competition. Not to mention numerous mammalian carnivores, at least ten avian predators often hunt them and they are among the most regular prey species for some smaller raptors, i.e. the sharp-shinned hawk and eastern screech-owl.

===Diet===

These birds forage on the ground under or near thickets or in low vegetation by kicking backward with both feet simultaneously. They mainly eat seeds, insects and berries, and are attracted to bird feeders. Blackberries, grapes, and rose hips are some fruits they eat. One of its favorite seeds is millet, but it will also feed on black oil sunflower and different seeds. During the summer, insects and other small invertebrates make up a larger portion of their diet.
==Song and calls==

White-throated sparrows produce song laterally through the left side of their syrinx, and control of their syrinx involves both their central and peripheral nervous systems. After damage to motor control of the left side of the syrinx, individuals were still able to produce sound but their song pattern was distorted, indicating the left side chiefly controls their production of song. There are at least two distinct songs sung by this species. One consists of an initial note, followed by three or so repeated notes at an interval of about a major third above. The second song consists of an initial note, a second a whole step lower, and a third note, repeated two or three times, about a minor third below that. This second song is commonly described by use of mnemonics with the cadence of &quot;Po-or Sam Peabody, Peabody, Peabody&quot; (or &quot;O-oh sweet Canada, Canada, Canada&quot;) The rhythm is very regular, and the timbre could be described as pinched. These musical intervals are only approximate; to a human ear the song often sounds out of tune. The repeated note will often change in pitch very slightly, contributing to this effect.

As reported by National Geographic in 2020, ornithologists have discovered a new song for the white-throated sparrow. This bird song begins in the same way as the typical song, but with a subtle difference: the repeating triplets, as in &quot;Peabody&quot;, become doublets, as in &quot;Cherry&quot;, ending with a final single tone. This new tune began to appear in British Columbia, Canada, and then spread east.

The white-throated sparrow also has at least two calls, in addition to its song.

== Threats ==
In a 2019 study based on monitoring efforts dating from 1978–2016, white-throated sparrows were found to be one of the most susceptible birds to building collisions, even being referred to as &quot;super colliders&quot;. Whereas some common Chicago birds, such as Warbling vireos (of which only two victims were found) or Least flycatchers, only appeared dozens of times as fatalities, as many as 10,000 white-throated sparrows were found in the same period. This may well be caused by both their attraction to artificial light as well as their use of nocturnal flight calls, causing a positive feedback loop wherein the sparrows are constantly attracted by both light and sound to their demise.

<text>Sir Kenelm Digby (11 July 1603 – 11 June 1665) was an English courtier and diplomat. He was also a highly reputed natural philosopher, astrologer and known as a leading Roman Catholic intellectual and Blackloist. For his versatility, he is described in John Pointer&#x27;s &quot;Oxoniensis Academia&quot; (1749) as the &quot;Magazine of all Arts and Sciences, or (as one stiles him) the Ornament of this Nation&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Digby was born at Gayhurst, Buckinghamshire, England. He was of gentry stock, but his family&#x27;s adherence to Roman Catholicism coloured his career. His father, Sir Everard, was executed in 1606 for his part in the Gunpowder Plot. Kenelm was sufficiently in favour with James I to be proposed as a member of Edmund Bolton&#x27;s projected Royal Academy (with George Chapman, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, John Selden and Sir Henry Wotton). His mother was Mary, daughter of William Mushlo. His uncle, John Digby, was the first Earl of Bristol.

He went to Gloucester Hall, Oxford, in 1618, where he was taught by Thomas Allen, but left without taking a degree. In time Allen bequeathed to Digby his library, and the latter donated it to the Bodleian.
He spent three years on the Continent between 1620 and 1623, where Marie de Medici fell madly in love with him (as he later recounted). In 1623, in Madrid, Digby was appointed to the household of Prince Charles, who had just arrived there. Returning to England the same year, he was knighted by James I and appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles. He was granted a Cambridge Master of Arts on the King&#x27;s visit to the university in 1624.

==Career==
Around 1625, he married Venetia Stanley, whose wooing he cryptically described in his memoirs. He had also become a member of the Privy Council of Charles I of England. As his Roman Catholicism hindered appointment to government office, he converted to Anglicanism.
Digby became a privateer in 1627. Sailing his flagship, the &quot;Eagle&quot; (later renamed &quot;Arabella&quot;), he arrived off Gibraltar on 18 January and captured several Spanish and Flemish vessels. From 15 February to 27 March he remained at anchor off Algiers due to illness of his men, and extracted a promise from authorities of better treatment of the English ships: he persuaded the city governors to free 50 English slaves. He seized a Dutch vessel near Majorca, and after other adventures gained a victory over the French and Venetian ships in the harbour of Iskanderun on 11 June. His successes, however, brought upon the English merchants the risk of reprisals, and he was urged to depart. He returned to become a naval administrator and later Governor of Trinity House.

His wife Venetia, a noted beauty, died suddenly in 1633, prompting a famous deathbed portrait by Van Dyck and a eulogy by Ben Jonson. (Digby was later Jonson&#x27;s literary executor. Jonson&#x27;s poem about Venetia is now partially lost, because of the loss of the centre sheet of a leaf of papers which held the only copy.) Digby, stricken with grief and the object of enough suspicion for the Crown to order an autopsy (rare at the time) on Venetia&#x27;s body, secluded himself in Gresham College and attempted to forget his personal woes through scientific experimentation and a return to Catholicism. At Gresham College he held an unofficial post, receiving no payment from the college. Digby, alongside Hungarian chemist Johannes Banfi Hunyades, constructed a laboratory under the lodgings of Gresham Professor of Divinity where the two conducted botanical experiments.

At that period, public servants were often rewarded with patents of monopoly; Digby received the regional monopoly of sealing wax in Wales and the Welsh Borders. This was a guaranteed income; more speculative were the monopolies of trade with the Gulf of Guinea and with Canada. These were doubtless more difficult to police.
==Marriage and children==

Digby married Venetia Stanley in 1625.
They had six sons:
*Kenelm Jr. (1625–1648), killed at the Battle of St Neots, 10 July 1648.
*John (1627–?), only son to survive Digby. He married and had two daughters.
*Everard (1629–1629), died in infancy.
*unnamed twins (1632), miscarriage.
*George (–1648), died of illness in school.

In addition, there was a daughter, Margery. Born c. 1625, who married Edward Dudley of Clopton and had at least one child. She is never mentioned by Digby in his writings. She may have been the daughter of Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset and Venetia Stanley prior to her marriage to Sir Kenelm. The Earl of Dorset settled an annuity on her. There is some controversy and confusion about whether or not Venetia had affairs with both the third and fourth Earls of Dorset and, consequently, which Earl was the father of Margery.

==Catholicism and Civil War==
Digby became a Catholic once more in 1635. He went into voluntary exile in Paris, where he spent most of his time until 1660. There he met both Marin Mersenne and Thomas Hobbes.

Returning to support Charles I in his struggle to establish episcopacy in Scotland (the Bishops&#x27; Wars), he found himself increasingly unpopular with the growing Puritan party. In the time between 1639 and 1640, he supported Charles I&#x27;s expedition against the Presbyterian Scots. He left England for France again in 1641. Following an incident in which he killed a French nobleman, Mont le Ros, in a duel, he returned to England via Flanders in 1642, and was jailed by the House of Commons. He was eventually released at the intervention of Anne of Austria, and went back again to France. He remained there during the remainder of the period of the English Civil War. Parliament declared his property in England forfeit.

Queen Henrietta Maria had fled England in 1644, and he became her Chancellor. He was then engaged in unsuccessful attempts to solicit support for the English monarchy from Pope Innocent X. His son, also called Kenelm, was killed at the Battle of St Neots, 1648. Following the establishment of the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, who believed in freedom of conscience, Digby was received by the government as a sort of unofficial representative of English Roman Catholics, and was sent in 1655 on a mission to the Papacy to try to reach an understanding. This again proved unsuccessful.

At the Restoration, Digby found himself in favour with the new regime due to his ties with Henrietta Maria, the Queen Mother. However, he was often in trouble with Charles II, and was once even banished from Court. Nonetheless, he was generally highly regarded until his death, a month before his 62nd birthday, from &quot;the stone&quot;, likely caused by kidney stones. He was buried in his wife&#x27;s tomb (which was damaged in the great fire of 1666), in Christ Church, Newgate Street, London.

==Character and works==
Digby published a work of apologetics in 1638, &quot;A Conference with a Lady about choice of a Religion&quot;. In it he argued that the Catholic Church, possessing alone the qualifications of universality, unity of doctrine and uninterrupted apostolic succession, is the only true church, and that the intrusion of error into it is impossible.

Digby was regarded as an eccentric by contemporaries, partly because of his effusive personality, and partly because of his interests in scientific matters. Henry Stubbe called him &quot;the very Pliny of our age for lying&quot;. He lived in a time when scientific enquiry had not settled down in any disciplined way. He spent enormous time and effort in the pursuits of astrology, and alchemy which he studied in the 1630s with Van Dyck.

Notable among his pursuits was the concept of the powder of sympathy. This was a kind of sympathetic magic; one manufactured a powder using appropriate astrological techniques, and daubed it, not on the injured part, but on whatever had caused the injury. His book on this mythical salve went through 29 editions. Synchronising the effects of the powder, which allegedly caused a noticeable effect on the patient when applied, was actually suggested in 1687 as a means of solving the longitude problem.

In 1644 he published together two major philosophical treatises, &quot;The Nature of Bodies&quot; and &quot;On the Immortality of Reasonable Souls&quot;. The latter was translated into Latin in 1661 by John Leyburn. These &quot;Two Treatises&quot; were his major natural-philosophical works, and showed a combination of Aristotelianism and atomism.
He was in touch with the leading intellectuals of the time, and was highly regarded by them; he was a founding member of the Royal Society and a member of its governing council from 1662 to 1663. His correspondence with Fermat contains the only extant mathematical proof by Fermat, a demonstration, using his method of descent, that the area of a Pythagorean triangle cannot be a square. His &quot;Discourse Concerning the Vegetation of Plants&quot; (1661) proved controversial among the Royal Society&#x27;s members. It was published in French in 1667. Digby is credited with being the first person to note the importance of &quot;vital air&quot;, or oxygen, to the sustenance of plants. He also came up with a crude theory of photosynthesis.

Digby is known for the publication of a cookbook, &quot;The Closet of the Eminently Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie Kt. Opened,&quot; but it was actually published by a close servant, from his notes, in 1669, several years after his death. It is currently considered an excellent source of period recipes, particularly for beverages such as mead. He tried out many of his recipes on his wife, Venetia, one of which was capons fed on the flesh of vipers.

Digby is also considered the father of the modern wine bottle. During the 1630s, Digby owned a glassworks at Newnham-on-Severn and manufactured glass onions, which were globular in shape with a high, tapered neck, a collar, and a punt. His manufacturing technique involved a coal furnace, made hotter than usual by the inclusion of a wind tunnel, and a higher ratio of sand to potash and lime than was customary. Digby&#x27;s technique produced wine bottles which were stronger and more stable than most of their day, and which due to their translucent green or brown color protected the contents from light. During his exile and prison term, others claimed his technique as their own, but in 1662 Parliament recognised his claim to the invention as valid.

==In fiction==
Digby and his wife are the subjects of the 2014 literary novel &quot;Viper Wine&quot; by Hermione Eyre.

He is mentioned in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;. In the chapter titled &quot;The Leech&quot;, the narrator describes the antagonist, Chillingworth, as having an impressive knowledge of medicine, remarking that Chillingworth claims to have been a colleague of Digby &quot;and other famous men&quot; in the study of natural philosophy. Digby&#x27;s &quot;scientific attainments&quot; are called &quot;hardly less than supernatural&quot;.

Digby also appears in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Island of the Day Before&quot; as &quot;Mr. d&#x27;Igby&quot;. He explains the principle of his sympathetic powder (&quot;unguentum armarium&quot;) to the main character.

<text>In a legend, Saint Georgea soldier venerated in Christianitydefeats a dragon. The story goes that the dragon originally extorted tribute from villagers. When they ran out of livestock and trinkets for the dragon, they started giving up a human tribute once a day. And, one day, the princess herself was chosen as the next offering. As she was walking towards the dragon&#x27;s cave, St. George saw her and asked her why she was crying. The princess told the saint about the dragon&#x27;s atrocities and asked him to flee immediately, in fear that he might be killed too. But the saint refused to flee, slayed the dragon, and rescued the princess. The narrative was first set in Cappadocia in the earliest sources of the 11th and 12th centuries, but transferred to Libya in the 13th-century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;.

The narrative has pre-Christian origins (Jason and Medea, Perseus and Andromeda, Typhon, etc.), and is recorded in various saints&#x27; lives prior to its attribution to Saint George specifically. It was particularly attributed to Saint Theodore Tiro in the 9th and 10th centuries, and was first transferred to Saint George in the 11th century. The oldest known record of Saint George slaying a dragon is found in a Georgian text of the 11th century.

The legend and iconography spread rapidly through the Byzantine cultural sphere in the 12th century. It reached Western Christian tradition still in the 12th century, via the crusades. The knights of the First Crusade believed that Saint George, along with his fellow soldier-saints Demetrius, Maurice, Theodore and Mercurius, had fought alongside them at Antioch and Jerusalem. The legend was popularised in Western tradition in the 13th century based on its Latin versions in the &quot;Speculum Historiale&quot; and the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;. At first limited to the courtly setting of chivalric romance, the legend was popularised in the 13th century and became a favourite literary and pictorial subject in the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it has become an integral part of the Christian traditions relating to Saint George in both Eastern and Western tradition.

==Origins==
===Pre-Christian predecessors===
The iconography of military saints Theodore, George and Demetrius as horsemen
is a direct continuation of the Roman-era &quot;Thracian horseman&quot; type iconography.
The iconography of the dragon appears to grow out of the serpent entwining the &quot;tree of life&quot; on one hand, and with the &quot;draco&quot; standard used by late Roman cavalry on the other.
Horsemen spearing serpents and boars are widely represented in Roman-era stelae commemorating cavalry soldiers.
A carving from Krupac, Serbia, depicts Apollo and Asclepius as Thracian horsemen, shown besides the serpent entwined around the tree. Another stele shows the Dioscuri as Thracian horsemen on either side of the serpent-entwined tree, killing a boar with their spears.

The development of the hagiographical narrative of the dragon-fight parallels the development of iconography.
It draws from pre-Christian dragon myths. The Coptic version of the Saint George legend, edited by E. A. Wallis Budge in 1888, and estimated by Budge to be based on a source of the 5th or 6th century, names &quot;governor Dadianus&quot;, the persecutor of Saint George as &quot;the dragon of the abyss&quot;, a Greek myth with similar elements of the legend is the battle between Bellerophon and the Chimera. Budge makes explicit the parallel to pre-Christian myth:

I doubt much of the whole story of Saint George is anything more than one of the many versions of the old-world story of the conflict between Light and Darkness, or Ra and Apepi, and Marduk and Tiamat, woven upon a few slender threads of historical fact. Tiamat, the scaly, winged, foul dragon, and Apepi the powerful enemy of the glorious Sungod, were both destroyed and made to perish in the fire which he sent against them and their fiends: and Dadianus, also called the &#x27;dragon&#x27;, with his friends the sixty-nine governors, was also destroyed by fire called down from heaven by the prayer of Saint George.

In anticipation of the Saint George iconography, first noted in the 1870s, a Coptic stone fenestrella shows a mounted hawk-headed figure fighting a crocodile, interpreted by the Louvre as Horus killing a metamorphosed Setekh.

===Christianised iconography===
Depictions of &quot;Christ militant&quot; trampling a serpent is found in Christian art of the late 5th century. Iconography of the horseman with spear overcoming evil becomes current in the early medieval period.
Iconographic representations of St Theodore as dragon-slayer are dated to as early as the 7th century, certainly by the early 10th century (the oldest certain depiction of Theodore killing a dragon is at Aghtamar, dated ).
Theodore is reported as having destroyed a dragon near Euchaita in a legend not younger than the late 9th century.
Early depictions of a horseman killing a dragon are unlikely to represent Saint George, who in the 10th century was depicted as killing a human figure, not a dragon.

The earliest image of St Theodore as a horseman (named in Latin) is from Vinica, North Macedonia and, if genuine, dates to the 6th or 7th century. Here, Theodore is not slaying a dragon, but holding a &quot;draco&quot; standard.
One of the Vinica icons also has the oldest representation of Saint George with a dragon:
George stands besides a cynocephalous Saint Christopher, both saints treading on snakes with human heads, and aiming at their heads with spears.
Maguire (1996) has connected the shift from unnamed equestrian heroes used in household magic to the more regulated iconography of named saints to the closer regulation of sacred imagery following the iconoclasm of the 730s.
In the West, a Carolingian-era depiction of a Roman horseman trampling and piercing a dragon between two soldier saints with lances and shields was put on the foot of a &quot;crux gemmata&quot;, formerly in the Treasury of the Basilica of Saint Servatius in Maastricht (lost since the 18th c.). The representation survives in a 17th-century drawing, now in the in Paris.
The &quot;Christianisation&quot; of the Thracian horseman iconography can be traced to the Cappadocian cave churches of Göreme, where frescoes of the 10th century show military saints on horseback confronting serpents with one, two or three heads. One of the earliest examples is from the church known as Mavrucan 3 (), generally dated to the 10th century, which portrays two &quot;sacred riders&quot; confronting two serpents twined around a tree, in a striking parallel to the Dioskuroi stela, except that the riders are now attacking the snake in the &quot;tree of life&quot; instead of a boar.
In this example, at least, there appear to be two snakes with separate heads, but other examples of 10th-century Cappadocia show polycephalous snakes.

A poorly preserved wall-painting at the (&quot;Snake Church&quot;) that depicts the two saints Theodore and George attacking a dragon has been tentatively dated to the 10th century, or alternatively even to the mid-9th.

A similar example, but showing three equestrian saints, Demetrius, Theodore and George,
is from the &quot;Zoodochos Pigi&quot; chapel in central Macedonia in Greece, in the prefecture of Kilkis, near the modern village of Kolchida, dated to the 9th or 10th century.

A 12th-century depiction of the mounted dragon-slayer, presumably depicting Theodore, not George,
is found in four muqarna panels in the nave of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo.

===Transfer to Saint George===

The dragon motif was transferred to the George legend from that of his fellow soldier saint, Saint Theodore Tiro.

The transfer of the dragon iconography from Theodore, or Theodore and George as &quot;Dioskuroi&quot; to George on his own, first becomes tangible in the early 11th century.
The oldest certain images of Saint George combatting the serpent are still found in Cappadocia.

==Golden Legend==
In the well-known version from Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Legenda aurea&quot; (&quot;The Golden Legend&quot;, 1260s), the narrative episode of Saint George and the Dragon took place somewhere he called &quot;Silene&quot; in what in medieval times was referred to as &quot;Libya&quot; (basically anywhere in North Africa, west of the Nile). Silene was being plagued by a venom-spewing dragon dwelling in a nearby pond, poisoning the countryside. To prevent it from affecting the city itself, the people offered it two sheep daily, then a man and a sheep, and finally their children and youths, chosen by lottery. One time the lot fell on the king&#x27;s daughter. The king offered all his gold and silver to have his daughter spared, but the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, dressed as a bride, to be fed to the dragon.

Saint George arrived at the spot. The princess tried to send him away, but he vowed to remain. The dragon emerged from the pond while they were conversing. Saint George made the Sign of the Cross and charged it on horseback, seriously wounding it with his lance. He then called to the princess to throw him her girdle (), and he put it around the dragon&#x27;s neck. Wherever she walked, the dragon followed the girl like a &quot;meek beast&quot; on a leash.

The princess and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the population. Saint George offered to kill the dragon if they consented to become Christians and be baptized. Fifteen thousand men including the king of Silene converted to Christianity. George then killed the dragon, beheading it with his sword, and the body was carted out of the city on four ox-carts. The king built a church to the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saint George on the site where the dragon died and a spring flowed from its altar with water that cured all disease.
Only the Latin version involves the saint striking the dragon with the spear, before killing it with the sword.

The &quot;Golden Legend&quot; narrative is the main source of the story of Saint George and the Dragon as received in Western Europe,
and is therefore relevant for Saint George as patron saint of England.
The princess remains unnamed in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; version, and the name &quot;Sabra&quot; is supplied by Elizabethan era writer Richard Johnson in his &quot;Seven Champions of Christendom&quot; (1596). In the work, she is recast as a princess of Egypt. This work takes great liberties with the material, and makes Saint George marry Sabra and have English children, one of whom becomes Guy of Warwick.
Alternative names given to the princess in Italian sources still of the 13th century are &quot;Cleolinda&quot; and &quot;Aia&quot;. Johnson also supplied the name of Saint George&#x27;s sword: &quot;Ascalon&quot;. The story of Saint George, as the Red Cross Knight and the patron saint of England, slaying the dragon, which represents sin, and Princess Una as George&#x27;s true love and an allegory representing the Protestant church as the one true faith, was told in altered fashion in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;.
==Iconography==
===Medieval iconography===
====Eastern====
The saint is depicted in the style of a Roman cavalryman in the tradition of the &quot;Thracian Heros&quot;.
There are two main iconographic types, the &quot;concise&quot; form showing only George and the dragon,
and the &quot;detailed&quot; form also including the princess and the city walls or towers of Lacia (Lasia) with spectators witnessing the miracle.
The &quot;concise&quot; type originates in Cappadocia, in the 10th to 11th century (transferred from the same iconography associated with Saint Theodore of Tiro in the 9th to 10th century).
The earliest certain example of the &quot;detailed&quot; form may be a fresco from Pavnisi (dated c. 1160), although the examples from Adishi, Bochorma and Ikvi may be slightly earlier.

Georgian
Greek
Russian
The oldest example in Russia found on walls of the church of St George in Staraya Ladoga, dated .
In Russian tradition, the icon is known as ; i.e., &quot;the miracle of George and the dragon&quot;. The saint is mostly shown on a white horse, facing right, but sometimes also on a black horse, or facing left.

The princess is usually not included. Another motif shows George on horseback with the youth of Mytilene sitting behind him.

Ethiopian


====Western====
The motif of Saint George as a knight on horseback slaying the dragon first appears in western art in the second half of the 13th century.
The tradition of the saint&#x27;s arms being shown as the red-on-white Saint George&#x27;s Cross develops in the 14th century.

==Literary adaptations==
Edmund Spenser expands on the Saint George and the Dragon story in Book I of the &quot;Fairy Queen&quot;, initially referring to the hero as the &quot;Redcross Knight&quot;.
William Shakespeare refers to Saint George and the Dragon in &quot;Richard III&quot; ( &quot;Advance our standards, set upon our foes Our ancient world of courage fair St. George Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons&quot; act V, sc. 3), &quot;Henry V&quot; ( &quot;The game&#x27;s afoot: follow your spirit, and upon this charge cry &#x27;God for Harry, England, and Saint George!&quot;&#x27; act III, sc. 1), and also in &quot;King Lear&quot; (act I).

A 17th-century broadside ballad paid homage to the feat of George&#x27;s dragon slaying. Titled &quot;St. George and the Dragon&quot;, the ballad considers the importance of Saint George in relation to other heroes of epic and Romance, ultimately concluding that all other heroes and figures of epic or romance pale in comparison to the feats of George.

&quot;The Banner of St George&quot; by Edward Elgar is a ballad for chorus and orchestra, words by Shapcott Wensley (1879).
The 1898 &quot;Dream Days&quot; by Kenneth Grahame includes a chapter entitled &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot;, in which an elderly Saint George and a benign dragon stage a mock battle to satisfy the townsfolk and get the dragon introduced into society. Later made into a film by Walt Disney Productions, and set to music by John Rutter as a children&#x27;s operetta.

In 1935 Stanley Holloway recorded a humorous retelling of the tale as &quot;St. George and the Dragon&quot; written by Weston and Lee.
In the 1950s, Stan Freberg and Daws Butler wrote and performed &quot;St. George and the Dragon-Net&quot; (a spoof of the tale and of &quot;Dragnet&quot;) for Freberg&#x27;s radio show. The story&#x27;s recording became the first comedy album to sell over a million copies.

Margaret Hodges retold the legend in a 1984 children&#x27;s book (&quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot;) with Caldecott Medal-winning illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.

The Forever Knights that serve as a recurring antagonist faction in the &quot;Ben 10&quot; are revealed in the third series &quot;Ben 10: Ultimate Alien&quot; to have been founded by Sir George from the legend of Saint George and the Dragon, with the tale directly referenced by name. The dragon that George fought is depicted as a shapeshifting extradimensional demon named Dagon, worshipped by a cult called the Flame Keepers’ Circle that goes to war against the Forever Knights. Series main antagonist Vilgax takes advantage of his true form&#x27;s coincidental resemblance to Dagon&#x27;s true appearance to manipulate the Flame Keepers’ Circle into helping him find the heart of Dagon, which George had cut out and sealed with the Ascalon, depicted here as a sword of alien origin created by Azmuth prior to inventing the Omnitrix.

Samantha Shannon describes her 2019 novel &quot;The Priory of the Orange Tree&quot; as a &quot;feminist retelling&quot; of Saint George and the Dragon.

<doc id="250716" wikidata="Q6137439" url="?curid=250716" title="James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908)">
<text>Sir James Thomas Knowles (13 October 1831 – 13 February 1908) was an English architect and editor. He was intimate with the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson and the founder of the Metaphysical Society to encourage rapprochement between religion and science.

==Life==
James Knowles was born in London, the son of the architect James Thomas Knowles (1806–1884), and himself trained in architecture at University College and in Italy. Among the buildings he designed were three churches in Clapham, South London, Mark Masons&#x27; Hall, London (later the Thatched House Club), Lord Tennyson&#x27;s house at Aldworth, the Leicester Square garden (as restored at the expense of Albert Grant), Albert Mansions, Victoria Street in Westminster, and an 1882 enlargement of the Royal Sea Bathing Hospital at Margate in Kent.

However, he also developed a literary career. In 1860 he published &quot;The Story of King Arthur&quot;. In 1866 he was introduced to Alfred Lord Tennyson and later agreed to design his new house with the condition that there was not any fee. This resulted in a close friendship, Knowles assisting Tennyson with business matters, and among other things helping to design scenery for the play &quot;The Cup&quot;, when Henry Irving produced it in 1880.

Knowles corresponded with a number of the most interesting men of the day, and in 1869, with Tennyson&#x27;s cooperation, he initiated the Metaphysical Society, the object of which was to attempt some intellectual rapprochement between religion and science by inviting major representatives of faith and unfaith to meet and exchange opinions. Members included Tennyson, Gladstone, W. K. Clifford, W. G. Ward, John Morley, Cardinal Manning, Archbishop Thomson, T. H. Huxley, Arthur Balfour, Leslie Stephen, and Sir William Gull. The society included many men who became contributors to magazines edited by Knowles.

In 1870 he succeeded Dean Alford as editor of the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;, but quit it in 1877 owing to the objection of the proprietors to the inclusion of articles (by W. K. Clifford notably) attacking Theism, and he initiated the &quot;Nineteenth Century&quot; (to the title of which, in 1901, were added the words &quot;And After&quot;). Both periodicals became influential while he was editor of them, and were the new sort of monthly review which replaced the popularity of the quarterlies. For example, it helped halt the Channel Tunnel project, by publishing a protest signed by many distinguished men in 1882. In 1904 he received a knighthood. He was a considerable collector of works of art.

Knowles was married twice, first in 1860 to Jane Borradaile, then in 1865 to Isabel Hewlett. He died in Brighton and was buried at the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.

<doc id="250719" wikidata="Q1444179" url="?curid=250719" title="Internet in China">
<text>China has been on the Internet intermittently since May 1989 and on a permanent basis since 20 April 1994, although with heavily censored access. In 2008, China became the country with the largest population on the Internet and, , has remained so. 1.09 billion (77.5% of the country&#x27;s total population) use internet in China.

China&#x27;s first foray into the global cyberspace was an email (not TCP/IP based and thus technically not internet) sent on 20 September 1987 to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, reading, &quot;Across the Great Wall, towards the rest of the world&quot; (). This later became a well-known phrase in China and , was displayed on the desktop login screen for QQ mail.

==History==
From 1995 to 2004, internet use in China was almost entirely in urban areas. By 2003, less than 0.2% of rural people had used the internet. In 2004, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began the Connecting Every Village Project which promoted the use of telecommunications and internet in rural China. Beginning in late 2009, the program began building rural telecenters each of which had at least one telephone, computer, and internet connectivity. Approximately 90,000 rural telecenters were built by 2011. By 2011, 89% of administrative villages had internet access.

China replaced the U.S. in its global leadership in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth in 2011. By 2014, China hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential than the U.S., the historical leader in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth (China: 29% versus US: 13% of the global total).

China began implementing a National Broadband Strategy in 2013. The program aimed to increase the speed, quality, and adoption of broadband and 4G networks. As of 2018, 96% of administrative villages had fiber optic networks and 95% had 4G networks.

Wireless, especially internet access through a mobile phone, has developed rapidly. The affordability of mobile phones and internet data in China has resulted in the number of mobile internet users in China surpassing the number of computer internet users. 500 million were accessing the internet via cell phones in 2013. The number of dial-up users peaked in 2004 and since then has decreased sharply. Generally statistics on the number of mobile internet users in China show a significant slump in the growth rate between 2008 and 2010, with a small peak in the next two years.

In 2015, the State Council promoted the Internet Plus initiative, a five-year plan to integrate traditional manufacturing and service industries with big data, cloud computing, and Internet of things technology. The State Council provided support for Internet Plus through policy support in area including cross-border e-commerce and rural e-commerce. Various regulatory bodies promoted Internet Plus within their sectors.

In April 2020, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) proposed that &quot;satellite internet&quot; should be a part of new national infrastructure. By the next month, Shanghai, Beijing, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Shenzhen had each proposed regional action plans to support the new satellite internet constellation project with a goal to provide domestic China satellite internet to rural areas. Beginning in 2019, US (SpaceX Starlink) and UK (OneWeb, 2020) private companies had begun fielding large internet satellite constellations with global coverage; however China does not intend to license non-Chinese technical solutions for satellite broadband within the jurisdiction of Chinese law.

==Structure==
An important characteristic of the Chinese internet is that online access routes are owned by the Chinese government, and private enterprises and individuals can only rent bandwidth from the state. The first four major national networks, namely CSTNET, ChinaNet, CERNET and CHINAGBN, are the &quot;backbone&quot; of the mainland Chinese internet. Later dominant telecom providers also started to provide internet services. China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile control operate the internet exchange points through which incoming traffic must pass.

In January 2015, China added seven new access points to the world&#x27;s internet backbone, adding to the three points that connect through Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

As of at least 2023, the internet in China is characterized by uneven development, with the adoption rate and availability of the internet varying by region and population groups.

==Userbase==

According to a survey by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China had 1.09 billion Internet users by the end of December 2023, a 1.9% increase over the year before and a penetration rate of 77.5%. The proportions of users accessing the Internet via mobile phones, desktop computers, laptop computers, TVs and tablet computers were 99.9%, 33.9%, 30.3%, 22.5% and 26.6%, respectively. 51.2% of internet users were male, while the remaining 48.8% were female.

English-language media in China often use the word netizen to refer to Chinese internet users in particular.

As of at least 2024, China has the largest number of internet users of any country. Consistent with the trends of other large and relatively linguistically isolated countries, Chinese internet users tend to focus their internet use on content that is domestically relevant.

As of 2024, 20% of internet users around the world are Chinese.

== Regulation ==
The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is the primary agency for data regulation and content regulation. It coordinates data regulation enforcement among relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) and the State Administration for Market Regulation. The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) has the primary responsibility for preventing cyberattacks.

=== Regulatory priorities ===
In 2009, China amended its Criminal Law to create a low threshold for the prosecution of malicious cybercrimes and illegal data sales.

Generally, China advocates for internet sovereignty and tends to prioritize cybersecurity more than personal data protection. Chinese policymakers became increasingly concerned about the risk of cyberattacks following the 2010s global surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden, which demonstrated extensive United States intelligence activities in China. As part of its response, the Communist Party in 2014 formed the Cybersecurity and Information Leading Group.

The 2017 Cyber Security Law was also part of China&#x27;s response to increased risks of foreign surveillance and foreign data collection following the United States surveillance disclosures. Among other provisions, the law has significant data localization requirements. It is a major pillar of the Chinese data regulatory environment.

Before the 2020-2021 Xi Jinping administration reform spree, the regulatory environment for internet companies was relatively lax because the government sought to encourage the development of the big data economy. The regulatory environment for tech companies subsequently became stricter and in 2021, two national data laws and a host of regulatory guidelines were promulgated, broadening the scope of government enforcement and increasing the penalties for personal data violations. After mid-2023, the government decreased its regulatory intervention in e-commerce and issued policies more supportive of the e-commerce sector.

The 2021 Data Security Law classifies data into different categories and establishes corresponding levels of protection. It imposes significant data localization requirements, in a response to the extraterritorial reach of the United States CLOUD Act or similar foreign laws.

The 2021 Personal Information Protection Law is China&#x27;s first comprehensive law on personal data rights and is modeled after the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation.

In summer 2021, MIIT began a six-month long regulatory campaign to address a variety of consumer protection and unfair competition issues, including interoperability concerns, in the consumer internet sector. It held meetings with executives from major Chinese tech companies and instructed them that their companies could no longer block external links to competitors.

In 2022, the CAC issued measures and guidelines on security assessments for cross-border data transfers as part of an effort to institutionalize data transfer review mechanisms.

In July 2024, the CAC and the MPS released draft regulations that propose a voluntary digital ID number for all internet users nationwide instead of the current requirement for a phone number or personal ID number.

=== Regulations regarding minors ===
As a result of public outcry over parent-child online gaming conflicts, the government issued legislation in the early 2000s. In 2002, the government passed legislation which forbid Internet cafes from allowing minors. The Law on Protection of Minors was amended in 2006 to state that the family and the state should guide minors&#x27; online behavior. These amendments place &quot;indulgence in the Internet&quot; on par with misbehaviors like smoking and vagrancy.

In 2009, the government requested that to aid parents in monitoring what children were doing on the Internet, &quot;Green Dam Youth Escort&quot; software be pre-installed on personal computers sold in most parts of China (excluding Special Administrative Regions). This resulted in public criticism on the basis of privacy concerns, and the government abandoned the effort after several months.

The state requires online games to set limits for minors&#x27; playing time.

==Content==
According to Kaiser Kuo, the internet in China is largely used for entertainment purposes, being referred to as the &quot;entertainment superhighway&quot;. However, it also serves as the first public forum for Chinese citizens to freely exchange their ideas. Most users go online to read news, to search for information, and to check their email. They also go to BBS or web forums, find music or videos, or download files.

=== Messaging ===
As of at least 2023, the most used internet services in China are instant messaging and mobile messaging apps. In 2020, 99% of internet users in China used instant messaging, while 99.8% used mobile messaging apps.

As of 2019, 93.5% of Chinese internet users have used WeChat.

===Websites===
All websites that operate in China with their own domain name must have an ICP license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Because the PRC government blocks many foreign websites, many homegrown copycats of foreign websites have appeared.

===Search engines===
Baidu is the leading search engine in China, while most web portals also provide search opportunities like Bing and Sogou.

Efforts to establish state-owned search engines in China have not succeeded. Search engine ChinaSo.com, jointly managed by Xinhua News Agency and &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, is active as of 2024 but has few users. State-run search engine Jike Search, the CEO of which was Deng Yaping, failed in 2013.

===Online communities===
Although the Chinese write fewer emails, they enjoy other online communication tools. Users form their communities based on different interests. Bulletin boards on portals or elsewhere, chat rooms, instant messaging groups, blogs are very active, while photo-sharing and social networking sites are growing rapidly. Some Wikis such as the Sogou Baike and Baidu Baike are &quot;flourishing&quot;.

Microblogs (&quot;weibo&quot;) have since 2009 become one of the most widely used internet services in China.

===Social media===
China is one of the most restricted countries in the world in terms of internet, but these constraints have directly contributed to the success of local Chinese social media sites.

===Online shopping===
Since 2013, China is the world&#x27;s largest e-commerce market. Its domestic e-commerce market was an estimated in 2016. China accounted for 42.4% of worldwide retail e-commerce in that year, the most of any country.In 2019, online retail sales were 21% of China&#x27;s total retail sales. As of late 2022, approximately 850 million Chinese individuals shop online and sectors related to e-commerce employ 69 million people in the country. In 2023, nearly 50% of worldwide online sales took place from China.

Some local governments have created e-commerce platforms in an effort to facilitate sales of local products. With the exception of the business-to-business platform Yiwugo.com (created by the Yiwu city government and a state-owned enterprise), these platforms have not been commercially successful.

===Online Mapping Services===
China has endeavored to offer a number of online mapping services and allows the dissemination of geographic information within the country. Tencent Maps (腾讯地图), Baidu Maps (百度地圖) and Tianditu (天地圖) are typical examples. Online mapping services can be understood as online cartography backed up by a geographic information system (GIS). GIS was originally a tool for cartographers, geographers and other types of specialists to store, manage, present and analyze spatial data. In bringing GIS online, the Web has made these tools available to a much wider audience. Furthermore, with the advent of broadband, utilizing GIS has become much faster and easier. Increasingly, non-specialist members of the public can access, look up and make use of geographic information for their own purposes. Tianditu is China&#x27;s first online mapping service. Literally World Map, Tianditu was launched in late October 2010. The Chinese government has repeatedly claimed that this service is to offer comprehensive geographical data for Chinese users to learn more about the world.

=== Online payment ===
The method of directly paying by online banking is required to be able to make online banking payment after opening online banking and can realize online payment of UnionPay, WeChat Pay, online payment by credit card, and so on.

This payment method is directly paid from the bank card. The third-party payment itself integrates multiple payment methods, and the process is as follows:

1. Recharge the money in online banking to a third-party.

2. Pay by third-party deposit when the user pays.

3. The fee is charged for withdrawal. Third-party payment methods are diverse, including mobile payments and fixed-line payments.

In 2013, Alipay overtook PayPal to become the world&#x27;s largest mobile payment provider. As of January 2015, Alipay, owned by Alibaba Group has 600 million counts of users and has the largest user group among all online-payment providers. It continues to be China&#x27;s largest online payment service as of at least 2023. WeChat Pay remains a strong competitor to Alipay, with 37% of the Chinese mobile payment market as of 2016.

By June 2020, there were 805 million users of mobile payment in China.

By June 2024, about 954 million individuals were actively using mobile payment in China. 

===Online gaming===

As of 2022, China is the second largest market for online games after the United States. In 2023, the country has 668 million internet users playing online games and the industry was worth US$42 billion. 53.8% of gamers are male, 46.2% are female.

In 2007, the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) along with several other agencies implemented the Online Game Anti-Addiction System which aimed to stop video game addiction in youth. This system restricted minors from playing more than 3 hours a day and required Identification (ID) checking in order to verify you are of age.

Later in 2019, the Chinese government announced in November that gamers under the age of 18 would be banned from playing video games between the hours of 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. In addition, gamers under 18 would be restricted to 90 minutes of playing during the weekdays and 3 hours of playing during weekends and holidays as per new guidelines.

As of 2021, the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) further restricted rules limiting playtime for under-18s to one hour per day from 8p.m. to 9 p.m. and only on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

===Censorship===
The Golden Shield Project was proposed to the State Council by Premier Zhu Rongji in 1993. It is overseen by the Ministry of Public Security. As a massive surveillance and content control system, it was launched in November 2000, and became known as the Great Firewall of China. The governmental authorities not only block website content but also monitor the Internet access of individuals; such measures have attracted the nickname The Great Firewall of China.

However, there are some methods of circumventing the censorship by using proxy servers outside the firewall. Users may circumvent all of the censorship and monitoring of the Great Firewall if they have a secure VPN or SSH connection method to a computer outside mainland China.

In 2017, the Chinese government declared unauthorized VPN services illegal, requiring VPN providers to obtain state approval. Although China restricts VPNs, they remain widely used by private individuals. State-owned enterprises or state institutions also use VPNs for official work. The Chinese government has authorized several official VPN providers. Those who develop or sell their own VPNs potentially face years in prison.

Different methods are used to block certain websites or pages including DNS poisoning, blocking access to IPs, analyzing and filtering URLs, inspecting filter packets and resetting connections.

In 2009, motivated in part by its desire to prevent color revolutions, China banned Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. It banned Google the next year. By blocking major international internet platforms such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, the Great Firewall has contributed to the development of domestic alternatives including Baidu, Renren, Youku, and Weibo.

===Memes===
The Baidu 10 Mythical Creatures, initially a humorous hoax, became a popular and widespread internet meme in China. These ten hoaxes reportedly originated in response to increasing online censorship and have become an icon of Chinese internet users&#x27; resistance to it.

The State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television issued a directive on 30 March 2009 to highlight 31 categories of content prohibited online, including violence, pornography and content which may &quot;incite ethnic discrimination or undermine social stability&quot;. Many Chinese internet users believe the instruction follows the official embarrassment over the &quot;Grass Mud Horse&quot; and the &quot;River Crab&quot;. Industry observers believe that the move was designed to stop the spread of parodies or other comments on politically sensitive issues in the runup to the anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen Square protests.

==Internet advertising market==
The size of China&#x27;s online advertising market was RMB 3.3 billion in the third quarter 2008, up 19.1% compared with the previous quarter. Tencent, Baidu.com Inc, Sina Corp remain the Top 3 in terms of market share. Keyword advertising market size reached RMB 1.46 billion, accounting for 43.8% of the total Internet advertising market with a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of 19.3%, while that of the online advertising site amounted to RMB 1.70 billion, accounting for 50.7% of the total, up 18.9% compared with the second quarter.

Currently, Baidu has launched the CPA platform, and Sina Corp has launched an advertising scheme for intelligent investment. The moves indicate a market trend of effective advertising with low cost. Online advertisements of automobiles, real estate and finance will keep growing rapidly in the future.

Joe Keithley was raised in Burnaby, British Columbia, and attended Burnaby North Secondary. At age 11, he began playing drums after being inspired by a drummer in a jazz band at his sister&#x27;s wedding. Keithley recalls his father&#x27;s chagrin at Keithley &quot;banging on a kit of his own&quot;, describing his father as &quot;super square... completely right wing&quot;. He would later take up the guitar and vocals, with some of his classmates becoming his bandmates.

In 1972, in light of the ongoing Vietnam War and the American&#x27;s planned testing of nuclear weapons off the coast of Alaska&#x27;s Amchitka Island, 16 year old Keithley and 300 fellow students participated in a school walkout to join a protest organized by Greenpeace. Since then, music and activism have been &quot;fused at the center of Keithley&#x27;s life&quot;.

==Musical career==
In 1977, Keithley, along with Chuck Biscuits&#x27; older brother, started a band called the Skulls. After the breakup of the Skulls, Keithley formed D.O.A. with Biscuits.

In 2004, he published the autobiography &quot;I, Shithead: A Life in Punk&quot;. He was inducted into the Canadian Independent Music Hall of Fame the same year.
He has also done solo work, releasing a mix of music and spoken word. In 1999, he released his first solo record, &quot;Beat Trash&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Band of Rebels&quot; in 2007.

Keithley appeared in the punk/cult film &quot;Terminal City Ricochet&quot;, as well as contributing music (through D.O.A.) to the soundtrack. He and D.O.A. appeared in Bruce McDonald&#x27;s 1995 cult film &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;. He was interviewed for a documentary titled Let&#x27;s All Hate Toronto, produced by Elevator Films and published by The Disinformation Company. In 2006, Keithley was featured prominently in the feature-length documentary American Hardcore. Keithley was also featured in the 2010 documentary &quot;Open Your Mouth And Say... Mr. Chi Pig&quot;, a film that looks at the life of Mr. Chi Pig of SNFU, directed by Sean Patrick Shaul and produced by Prairie Coast Films.

In 2008, The Vancouver Sun newspaper named Keithley one of British Columbia&#x27;s most influential people of all time.

During D.O.A.&#x27;s 2011 Canadian tour, Keithley gave free solo acoustic performances in three of the 10 cities that had appeared across Canada in support of the Occupy Wall Street protests, Occupy Ottawa, Occupy Regina and Occupy Vancouver.

He owns and operates his own record company, Sudden Death Records. The recording company was started in 1978 as a DIY response to lack of interest from major labels. His motto is &#x27;TALK-ACTION=ZERO.&#x27;

==Politics==
D.O.A. is known for playing in peace rallies and environmental events. Keithley has been increasingly interested in politics, saying that shows where he can make a difference are more rewarding. While studying at the University of British Columbia, he planned to become a labor lawyer, but found music irresistible. In 1996 and 2001, Keithley ran in the British Columbia provincial elections for the Green Party of British Columbia. In 2001, he received the highest percentage of the vote next to party leader Adriane Carr. He ran for the Burnaby-Lougheed seat in the 2017 British Columbia provincial election. On October 20, 2018, he was elected for Burnaby City Council in the 2018 municipal elections as a member of the Burnaby Green Party.

<doc id="250724" wikidata="Q22048" url="?curid=250724" title="Odisha">
<text>Odisha (: ; ), formerly Orissa (the official name until 2011), is a state located in Eastern India. It is the eighth-largest state by area, and the eleventh-largest by population, with over 41 million inhabitants. The state also has the third-largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India. It neighbours the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. Odisha has a coastline of along the Bay of Bengal in the &quot;Indian Ocean&quot;. The region is also known as Utkaḷa and is mentioned by this name in India&#x27;s national anthem, Jana Gana Mana. The language of Odisha is Odia, which is one of the Classical languages of India.

The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War, coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha. The modern boundaries of Odisha were demarcated by the British Indian government, the Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking districts of Bihar and Orissa Province, Madras Presidency and Central Provinces. Utkala Dibasa () is celebrated on 1 April. Cuttack was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in , after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, through the British era until 1948. Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.

The economy of Odisha is the 15th-largest state economy in India with in gross domestic product and a per capita GDP of . Odisha ranks 32nd among Indian states in Human Development Index.

== Etymology ==

The terms &quot;Odisha&quot; and &quot;Orissa&quot; (, &quot;Oṛissa&quot;) derive from the ancient Prakrit word &quot;Odda Visaya&quot; (also &quot;&quot;Udra Bibhasha&quot; or &quot;Odra Bibhasha&quot;&quot;) as in the Tirumalai inscription of Rajendra Chola I, which is dated to 1025. Sarala Das, who translated the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; into the Odia language in the 15th century, calls the region &#x27;Odra Rashtra&#x27; as Odisha. The inscriptions of Kapilendra Deva of the Gajapati Kingdom (1435–67) on the walls of temples in Puri call the region &quot;Odisha&quot; or &quot;Odisha Rajya&quot;.

In 2011, the English rendering of was changed from &quot;Orissa&quot; to &quot;Odisha&quot;, and the name of its language from &quot;Oriya&quot; to &quot;Odia&quot;, by the passage of the &quot;Orissa (Alteration of Name) Bill, 2010&quot; and the &quot;Constitution (113th Amendment) Bill, 2010&quot; in the Parliament. The Hindi rendering () was also modified to (). After a brief debate, the lower house, Lok Sabha, passed the bill and amendment on 9 November 2010. On 24 March 2011, Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, also passed the bill and the amendment. The changes in spelling were made with the intention of having the English and Hindi renditions conform to the Odia transliteration. However, the underlying Odia texts were nevertheless transliterated incorrectly as per the Hunterian system, the official national transliteration standard, in which the transliterations would be and instead.

== History ==
Prehistoric Acheulian tools dating to Lower Paleolithic era have been discovered in various places in the region, implying an early settlement by humans. Kalinga has been mentioned in ancient texts like &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; and &quot;Mahagovinda Suttanta&quot;.

According to political scientist Sudama Misra, the Kalinga janapada originally comprised the area covered by the Puri and Ganjam districts. The Sabar people of Odisha have also been mentioned in the Mahabharata. Baudhayana mentions Kalinga as not yet being influenced by Vedic traditions, implying it followed mostly tribal traditions.
Ashoka of the Mauryan dynasty conquered Kalinga in the bloody Kalinga War in 261 BCE, which was the eighth year of his reign. According to his own edicts, in that war about 100,000 people were killed, 150,000 were captured and more were affected. The resulting bloodshed and suffering of the war is said to have deeply affected Ashoka. He turned into a pacifist and converted to Buddhism.

By c. 150 BCE, Emperor Kharavela, who was possibly a contemporary of Demetrius I of Bactria, conquered a major part of the Indian sub-continent. Kharavela was a Jain ruler. He also built the monastery atop the Udayagiri hill. Subsequently, the region was ruled by monarchs, such as Samudragupta and Shashanka. It was also a part of Harsha&#x27;s empire.

The city of Brahmapur in Odisha is also known to have been the capital of the Pauravas during the closing years of 4th century CE. Nothing was heard from the Pauravas from about the 3rd century CE, because they were annexed by the Yaudheya Republic, who in turn submitted to the Mauryans. It was only at the end of 4th century CE, that they established royalty at Brahmapur, after about 700 years.

Later, the kings of the Somavamsi dynasty began to unite the region. By the reign of Yayati II, c. 1025 CE, they had integrated the region into a single kingdom. Yayati II is supposed to have built the Lingaraj temple at Bhubaneswar. They were replaced by the Eastern Ganga dynasty. Notable rulers of the dynasty were Anantavarman Chodaganga, who began reconstruction on the present-day Shri Jagannath Temple in Puri (c. 1135), and Narasimhadeva I, who constructed the Konark temple (c. 1250).

The Eastern Ganga Dynasty was followed by the Gajapati Kingdom. The region resisted integration into the Mughal empire until 1568, when it was conquered by Sultanate of Bengal. Mukunda Deva, who is considered the last independent king of Kalinga, was defeated and was killed in battle by a rebel Ramachandra Bhanja. Ramachandra Bhanja himself was killed by Bayazid Khan Karrani. In 1591, Man Singh I, then governor of Bihar, led an army to take Odisha from the Karranis of Bengal. They agreed to treaty because their leader Qutlu Khan Lohani had recently died. But they then broke the treaty by attacking the temple town of Puri. Man Singh returned in 1592 and pacified the region.

In 1751, the Nawab of Bengal Alivardi Khan ceded the region to the Maratha Empire.

The British had occupied the Northern Circars, comprising the southern coast of Odisha, as a result of the Second Carnatic War by 1760, and incorporated them into the Madras Presidency gradually. In 1803, the British ousted the Marathas from the Puri-Cuttack region of Odisha during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. The northern and western districts of Odisha were incorporated into the Bengal Presidency.

The Orissa famine of 1866 caused an estimated 1 million deaths. Following this, large-scale irrigation projects were undertaken. In 1903, the Utkal Sammilani organisation was founded to demand the unification of Odia-speaking regions into one state. On 1 April 1912, the Bihar and Orissa Province was formed. On 1 April 1936, Bihar and Orissa were split into separate provinces. The new province of Orissa came into existence on a linguistic basis during the British rule in India, with Sir John Austen Hubback as the first governor. Following India&#x27;s independence, on 15 August 1947, 27 princely states signed the document to join Orissa. Most of the Orissa Tributary States, a group of princely states, acceded to Orissa in 1948, after the collapse of the Eastern States Union.

== Geography ==
Odisha lies between the latitudes 17.780N and 22.730N, and between longitudes 81.37E and 87.53E. The state has an area of 155,707 km2, which is 4.87% of total area of India, and a coastline of 450 km. In the eastern part of the state lies the coastal plain. It extends from the Subarnarekha River in the north to the Rushikulya River in the south. The lake Chilika is part of the coastal plains. The plains are rich in fertile silt deposited by the six major rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal: Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, Baitarani, Brahmani, Mahanadi, and Rushikulya. The Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI), a Food and Agriculture Organization-recognised rice gene bank and research institute, is situated on the banks of Mahanadi in Cuttack. The stretch between Puri and Bhadrak in Odisha juts out a little into the sea, making it vulnerable to any cyclonic activity.

Three-quarters of the state is covered in mountain ranges. Deep and broad valleys have been made in them by rivers. These valleys have fertile soil and are densely populated. Odisha also has plateaus and rolling uplands, which have lower elevation than the plateaus. The highest point in the state is Deomali at 1,672 metres in Koraput district. Some other high peaks are: Sinkaram (1,620 m), Golikoda (1,617 m), and Yendrika (1,582 metres).

=== Climate ===
The state experiences four meteorological seasons: winter (January to February), pre-monsoon season (March to May), south-west monsoon season (June to September) and north east monsoon season (October–December). However, locally the year is divided into six traditional seasons (or &quot;rutus&quot;): &quot;Grishma&quot; (summer), &quot;Barsha&quot; (rainy season), &quot;Sharata&quot; (autumn), &quot;Hemanta&quot; (dewy),&quot;Sheeta&quot;(winter season) and &quot;Basanta&quot; (spring).
=== Biodiversity ===
According to a Forest Survey of India report released in 2012, Odisha has 48,903 km2 of wild forest, covering 31.41% of the state&#x27;s total area. The forests are classified into areas of dense forest (7,060 km2), medium dense forest (21,366 km2), open forest (forest without closed canopy; 20,477 km2) and scrub forest or scrubland (4,734 km2). The state also has bamboo forests (10,518 km2) and tidal areas of mangrove swamp (221 km2). The state is gradually losing its wilderness areas to timber smuggling, deforestation, destructive mining, and general urban industrialisation, as well as livestock grazing. There have been attempts at conservation and reforestation.

Due to the climate and good rainfall, Odisha&#x27;s evergreen and moist forests are uniquely suitable habitats for wild orchids. Around 130 species have been reported from the state. Around 97 of them are found in Mayurbhanj district alone. The Orchid House of the Nandankanan Zoological Park maintains some of these species.

Simlipal National Park is a protected wildlife area and Bengal tiger reserve spread over 2,750 km2 of the northern part of Mayurbhanj district. The park has around 1,078 species of plants, including 94 of the aforementioned orchids. The &quot;sal&quot; is the primary tree species. For fauna, the park is home to around 55 species of mammal, including the Bengal tiger, chital, chousingha, common langur, gaur, Indian elephant, Indian giant squirrel, jungle cat, leopard, muntjac, sambar, small Indian civet and wild boar. There are over 300 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna, as well as grey, Indian pied and Malabar pied hornbills. There are also some 60 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the famed king cobra, plus banded krait and tricarinate hill turtle. There is also a mugger crocodile breeding programme in nearby Ramtirtha.

The Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests, driving the herds of elephants to migrate away, as well as increasing human-elephant conflicts—which sometimes results in injury and death (on both sides). Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration after being accidentally electrocuted by power lines or even hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by ivory poachers. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants, but by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara Reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district, and Athagad. Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has leopards, jungle cats and herds of chital.

The Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district covers 650 km2, of which 150 km2 are mangroves. Gahirmatha Beach, in Bhitarkanika, is the world&#x27;s largest nesting site for olive ridley sea turtles. In 2013, the Indian Coast Guard initiated Operation Oliver to protect the endangered sea turtle population of the region. Other major nesting grounds for the turtle in the state are Rushikulya, in Ganjam district, and the mouth of the Devi river. The Bhitarkanika sanctuary is also noted for its large population of saltwater crocodiles and Asian water monitors, the second-largest lizard species on earth, in addition to axis deer and rhesus macaques. The coastal mangrove environments are home to several types of mudskippers, including the barred, Boddart&#x27;s blue-spotted and great blue-spotted mudskippers.

In winter, Bhitarkanika is also visited by migratory birds. Among the many species, both resident and migratory, are kingfishers (including black-capped, collared and common kingfishers), herons (such as black-crowned night, grey, purple and striated herons), Indian cormorants, openbill storks, Oriental white ibis, pheasant-tailed jacana, sarus cranes, spotted owlets and white-bellied sea-eagles. The possibly endangered horseshoe crab is also found in this region.

Chilika Lake is a brackish water lagoon on the east coast of Odisha with an area of 1,105 km2. It is connected to the Bay of Bengal by a 35-km-long narrow channel and is a part of the Mahanadi delta. In the dry season, the tides bring in salt water. In the rainy season, the rivers falling into the lagoon decrease its salinity. Birds from places as far as the Caspian Sea, Lake Baikal (and other parts of Russia), Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Ladakh and the Himalayas migrate to the lagoon in winter. Among the waterfowl and wading birds spotted there are Eurasian wigeon, pintail, bar-headed goose, greylag goose, greater flamingo, common mallard and Goliath heron. The lagoon also has a small population of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins. The state&#x27;s coastal region has also had sightings of the rare finless porpoise, as well as the more common bottlenose dolphin, humpback dolphin and spinner dolphins in its waters.

Satapada is situated close to the northeast cape of Chilika Lake and Bay of Bengal. It is famous for dolphin watching in their natural habitat. There is a tiny island en route for watching dolphins, where tourists often take a short stop. Apart from that, this island is also home for tiny red crabs.

According to a census conducted in 2016, there are around 2000 elephants in the state.


== Government and politics ==
All states in India are governed by a parliamentary system of government based on universal adult franchise.

The main parties active in the politics of Odisha are the Biju Janata Dal, the Indian National Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. Following the Odisha State Assembly Election in 2019, the Naveen Patnaik-led Biju Janata Dal stayed in power for the sixth consecutive term until 2024. Currently, BJP , who won for the first time, formed the government after winning the majority in 2024 Odisha Legislative Assembly election. He is the 17th Chief Minister of Odisha.

=== Legislative assembly ===
The Odisha state has a unicameral legislature. The Odisha Legislative Assembly consists of 147 elected members, and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker, or by the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker&#x27;s absence. Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor of Odisha. The governor is appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The 147 elected representatives are called Members of the Legislative Assembly, or MLAs. One MLA may be nominated from the Anglo-Indian community by the governor. The term of the office is for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term.

The judiciary is composed of the Odisha High Court, located at Cuttack, and a system of lower courts.

=== Subdivisions ===
Odisha has been divided into 30 districts. These 30 districts have been placed under three different revenue divisions to streamline their governance. The divisions are North, Central and South, with their headquarters at Sambalpur, Cuttack and Berhampur respectively. Each division consists of ten districts and has as its administrative head a Revenue Divisional Commissioner (RDC). The position of the RDC in the administrative hierarchy is that between that of the district administration and the state secretariat. The RDCs report to the Board of Revenue, which is headed by a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service.

Each district is governed by a collector and district magistrate, who is appointed from the Indian Administrative Service or a very senior officer from Odisha Administrative Service. The collector and district magistrate is responsible for collecting the revenue and maintaining law and order in the district. Each district is separated into sub-divisions, each governed by a sub-collector and sub-divisional magistrate. The sub-divisions are further divided into tahasils. The tahasils are headed by tahasildar. Odisha has 58 sub-divisions, 317 tahasils and 314 blocks. Blocks consists of Panchayats (village councils) and town municipalities.

The capital of the state is Bhubaneswar and the largest city is Cuttack, which also functions as the deputy capital of the state . The other major cities are, Rourkela, Berhampur and Sambalpur. Municipal Corporations in Odisha include Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Rourkela.

Other municipalities of Odisha include Angul, Asika, Balangir, Balasore, Barbil, Bargarh, Baripada, Basudevpur, Belpahar, Bhadrak, Bhanjanagar, Bhawanipatna, Biramitrapur, Boudh, Brajarajnagar, Byasanagar, Chhatrapur, Deogarh, Dhamra,Dhenkanal, Gopalpur, Gunupur, Hinjilicut, Jagatsinghpur, Jajpur, Jeypore, Jharsuguda, Joda, Kendrapara, Kendujhar, Khordha, Konark, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nayagarh, Nuapada, Paradeep, Paralakhemundi, Phulbani, Puri, Rajgangpur, Rayagada, Sonepur, Sundargarh, Talcher, Titilagarh, Karanjia, Chatrapur, Asika, Kantabanji, Nimapada, Baudhgarh, and Umerkote.

Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs in rural areas.

== Economy ==
=== Macro-economic trend ===
Odisha is experiencing a rapid economic growth post-Covid. The impressive growth in gross domestic product of the state has been reported by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Odisha&#x27;s growth rate is above the national average. The central Government&#x27;s Urban Development Ministry has recently announced the names of 20 cities selected to be developed as smart cities. The state capital Bhubaneswar is the first city in the list of smart Cities released in January 2016, a pet project of the Indian Government. The announcement also marked with sanction of Rs 508.02 billion over the five years for development.

=== Industrial development ===
Odisha has abundant natural resources and a large coastline. Odisha has emerged as the most preferred destination for overseas investors with investment proposals. It contains a fifth of India&#x27;s coal, a quarter of its iron ore, a third of its bauxite reserves and most of the chromite.

Rourkela Steel Plant was the first integrated steel plant in the public sector in India, built with collaboration of Germany.

Arcelor-Mittal has also announced plans to invest in another mega steel project amounting to $10 billion.

<text>The Green Party of Ontario (GPO; ) is a political party in Ontario, Canada. The party is led by Mike Schreiner. Schreiner was elected as MPP for the riding of Guelph in 2018, making him the party&#x27;s first member of the Ontario Legislative Assembly. In 2023, Aislinn Clancy became the party&#x27;s second elected member following her win in the Kitchener Centre byelection. 

The Greens became an officially registered political party in 1983. It fielded 58 candidates in the 1999 provincial election, becoming the fourth-largest party in the province. In 2003, the party fielded its first nearly full slate, 102 out of 103 candidates, and received 2.8% of the vote. In 2007, the party fielded a full slate of 107 candidates, receiving over 8.0% and nearly 355,000 votes. Subsequently, the party&#x27;s popularity declined in the 2011 and 2014 elections during tightly contested races between the Progressive Conservatives and ruling Liberals. Its popularity and vote share have increased since, and in the 2022 election, the party received 5.96% of the vote.

==History==

===Early years===

The Green Party of Ontario became an official political party in 1983 and was registered with Elections Ontario. Shortly thereafter, the party contested its first election, fielding nine candidates who collected a combined 5,300 votes or 0.14%. In the 1987 election the party again ran nine candidates who fared worse, collecting 3,400 votes or 0.09%. In 1990, the party captured a higher result, with 40 candidates capturing 30,400 votes or 0.75%.

The party elected Frank de Jong as its first official leader in 1993. It ran its first election as an organized party in the 1995 provincial election, losing more than half its support and falling to just 14,100 votes or 0.34%.

De Jong led the party through three election campaigns, gradually building party support to just over 8% in the 2007 provincial election.

The 2003 provincial election saw an increase in vote share for the Ontario Greens. Running 102 out of a possible 103 candidates, the party captured 126,700 votes, or 2.82%. The GPO placed ahead of the Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP) in two ridings, and took fourth place in 92 others.

Throughout 2006, there was a move toward major constitutional changes in the party. Included in the changes were the formation of a much larger Provincial Executive, which included two gender paritied representatives from each of six regions, gender paritied Deputy Leaders, and the creation of multiple functionary roles separated from the Provincial Executive.

At the Party&#x27;s 2006 Annual General Meeting (AGM), it adopted further changes to the existing Constitution that, amongst other things, reduced the size of the Provincial Council and renamed it the Provincial Executive. One of the first acts of the new Provincial Executive was to strike a hiring committee to bring on a full-time campaign manager in response to mounting internal pressures to ensure the party was ready for the October 2007 provincial election.

Under de Jong&#x27;s leadership, the party fielded a full slate of 107 candidates in the 2007 provincial election, receiving over 8.0% and nearly 355,000 votes. In the run-up to election, the Greens&#x27; support climbed into the double-digits for the first time in party history. 

Although the party did not elect a member to the provincial legislature, it did increase its share of the popular vote to 8.1% (a gain of 5.3% from the 2003 election), placed second in one riding (Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, with 33.1% compared to the PC incumbent winner&#x27;s 46.7%), and took third place in a number of other ridings. Shane Jolley, the Green candidate for Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound, earned more votes than any Green candidate in Canadian history at that time.De Jong announced his resignation as leader on 16 May 2009, at the Green Party of Ontario Annual General Meeting. A leadership and policy convention was held 13–15 November 2009 in London, Ontario.

Following his resignation, de Jong was replaced by Toronto entrepreneur Mike Schreiner, who was the sole candidate in the party&#x27;s leadership race. The Greens failed to win seats in the subsequent 2011 and 2014 provincial elections, though Schreiner received 19% of the vote in Guelph in 2014.

=== 2018: Breakthrough ===

In the 2018 provincial election, their third election under leader Mike Schreiner, the party ran on a platform of investing in green jobs and clean energy, rolling out a universal basic income,and investing in mental health services. The party ran a full slate of candidates including over 50% women for the first time. Schreiner was excluded from the televised leaders debates, which led to an unsuccessful campaign by Fair Debates to encourage media to reverse the decisions.

In May 2018, a month ahead of that year&#x27;s general election, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; editorial board endorsed Schreiner as the best candidate in Guelph and said that he was &quot;the most forthright leader in the campaign for the 7 June Ontario election.&quot; Schreiner was also endorsed by the &quot;Guelph Mercury&quot;&#x27;s editorial board in an op-ed, &quot;Mike Schreiner is the candidate most worthy of representing Guelph provincially,&quot; citing ten reasons to vote for Schreiner.

Schreiner&#x27;s campaign proved successful, and he was elected as the first ever Green MPP in Ontario history. He captured 45 per cent of the vote in the Guelph riding, more than doubling the previous percentage and nearly tripling his raw vote numbers.

=== 2022–2023: Expanding ===

Schreiner was re-elected in the 2022 provincial election and was again the only Green candidate elected. The party narrowly lost in Parry Sound—Muskoka, a riding that had been held by the Progressive Conservatives since its establishment in 1999. Green candidate Matt Richter placed second to PC candidate Graydon Smith, losing by just over 2,100 votes.

The party elected its second MPP in 2023. Green candidate and deputy leader Aislinn Clancy was elected in a 2023 by-election in Kitchener Centre, doubling Green representation in the Legislature. Clancy won just under 48% of the vote, solidly beating the ONDP candidate. The seat had previously been in New Democratic hands since 2018.
==Policies==
The Green Party of Ontario shares the values identified by the Global Greens: participatory democracy, nonviolence, social justice, sustainability, respect for diversity and ecological wisdom. The party describes itself as socially progressive, environmentally focused and fiscally responsible.

In the lead-up to the 2022 election, the party released policy papers focused on housing, climate change and mental health. Its 2022 platform identified three priorities: a caring society, focussed on improving equitable healthcare, education, and social services; connected communities, focussed on tackling housing affordability by building more infill development, strengthening protections for renters and addressing speculation in the housing market; and new climate economy, focused on achieving net-zero emissions by 2045 by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, growing green jobs and protecting the environment.

=== Housing ===
The party advocates for more permissive zoning laws that allow the construction of missing-middle and midrise housing. It argues that infill development is more environmentally friendly and cost-effective than sprawl development.

Its elected members have also called for more stringent tenants protections and for the province to partner with non-profit and co-operative housing providers to build affordable non-market homes.

The party&#x27;s housing plan, released in 2021, featured seven strategies to build what the party referred to as &quot;more liveable and affordable communities.&quot; They included building more inclusive neighbourhoods through missing middle and midrise development, protecting farmland and other natural land from urban sprawl, building and maintaining a provincial affordable housing supply, ending chronic homelessness, strengthening protections for renters and addressing speculation in the housing market. The Toronto Star editorial board endorsed the plan, referring to it as &quot;an ambitious document that proposes tackling the housing crisis from all vantage points.&quot;

=== Climate ===
The Green Party supports phasing out fossil fuels and moving to renewable energy sources. Its platform included a number of measures to increase the affordability and accessibility of electric vehicles, retrofit homes and businesses to increase energy efficiency, and phase out fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2045.

The party is opposed to the construction of new nuclear plants. It has called for an end to the province&#x27;s offshore wind moratorium in order to increase access to renewable power.

Greens advocate for stronger protections to wetlands and agricultural land. Party leader Mike Schreiner was vocal in opposing the Ford government&#x27;s plan to allow development on southern Ontario&#x27;s Greenbelt, which was ultimately reversed in 2023. 

===Health===

The Greens&#x27; healthcare policies are rooted in prevention, including increasing upstream investments in the social determinants of health like social isolation, housing insecurity and poverty, as well as partnering with the federal government to implement universal pharmacare and dental care programs. The party advocates for improving the recruitment, retention and safety of public healthcare workers. It supports a publicly funded, publicly delivered healthcare system and opposes the privatisation of healthcare services. 

The party supports a non-profit long-term care system and has called to phase out for-profit long-term care homes while increasing base funding for the sector. In its 2022 platform, the party pledged to build 55,000 long-term care beds by 2033 and at least 96,000 by 2041.

In 2022, the party released a mental health policy paper calling for the expansion of access to mental health and addictions care under OHIP and an immediate base budget increase of 8% to the community mental health sector.

=== Education ===

The party&#x27;s education platform includes updating Ontario’s funding formula to reflect evolving student needs, including adequate funding for special education and rural and remote schools.

The party supports in-person learning and opposes mandatory e-learning or hybrid learning models. It has called for the elimination of EQAO standardised testing. 

In the 2022 provincial election, the party pledged to cap elementary classroom sizes at 24 students for grades four through eight and at 26 students for kindergarten.

At the postsecondary level, the party has called to increase sector funding by indexing the base operating grant for Ontario&#x27;s postsecondary institutions to the weighted national average.

Its 2022 platform called for the reversal of OSAP funding cuts through the conversion of loans to grants for low- and middle-income students and the elimination of interest charges on student debt.

During the 2007 provincial election, education, and specifically the funding of religious schools, was a central issue. GPO policy calls for an end to the publicly funded Catholic school system, a merger that it claimed would save millions of dollars in duplicate administrative costs. 

=== Social programs ===
The Green Party of Ontario believes in modernizing the social safety net to account for present-day challenges. Greens have advocated for the doubling of the Ontario Disability Support Program and Ontario Works. 

It has been an advocate for a universal Basic Income for all Ontarians, in order to provide economic security while at the same time cutting red tape and bureaucracy. 

The party supports ten-dollar-a-day daycare. In its 2022 platform, it pledged to work with the federal government to ensure continued funding for universal access to ten-dollar-a-day care.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Green party leader Mike Schreiner called for an increase in the number of provincially legislated sick days from three to ten and for a ban on employers requiring sick notes from employees who take time off due to illness.

===Electoral reform===
The GPO is a strong supporter of electoral reform. In its 2022 election platform, it called for the creation of a &quot;diverse, randomly selected Citizens Assembly on electoral reform&quot; to provide recommendations on how to modernise the Ontario electoral system to better reflect voters&#x27; democratic will.

=== Taxation ===

Greens have historically supported tax relief for small businesses, generally funded by modest increases to the corporate tax rate. They have also proposed road pricing (including tolls, parking levies and land-value taxes near subways) to pay for public transit.

The party has proposed a number of tax measures to reduce speculation in the housing market, including a multi-homes tax on all individuals and corporations owning more than two residential properties, a vacant homes tax and an anti-flipping tax.

The party favours a revenue neutral carbon fee-and-dividend approach to pollution pricing. In its 2022 platform, it proposed to take over federal administration of the carbon pricing system, increasing the price by $25 annually until it reaches $300/tonne and returning all revenues collected from individuals to individuals as dividends.

<text>Sir William Withey Gull, 1st Baronet (31 December 181629 January 1890) was an English physician. Of modest family origins, he established a lucrative private practice and served as Governor of Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Fullerian Professor of Physiology and President of the Clinical Society. In 1871, having successfully treated the Prince of Wales during a life-threatening attack of typhoid fever, he was created a Baronet and appointed to be one of the Physicians-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria.

Gull made some significant contributions to medical science, including advancing the understanding of myxoedema, Bright&#x27;s disease, paraplegia and anorexia nervosa (for which he first established the name).

A masonic/royal conspiracy theory created in the 1970s alleged that Gull knew the identity of Jack the Ripper, or even that he himself was the murderer. Scholars have dismissed the idea, since Gull was 71 years old and in ill health when the murders were committed. The theory has been used by creators of fictional works. Examples for his portrayal as Jack the Ripper include the films &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (1988) and &quot;From Hell&quot; (2001), the latter based on the graphic novel.

==Childhood and early life==

William Withey Gull was born on 31 December 1816 in Colchester, Essex. His father, John Gull, was a barge owner and wharfinger and was thirty-eight years old at the time of his son&#x27;s birth. William was born aboard his barge &quot;The Dove,&quot; then moored at St Osyth Mill in the parish of Saint Leonards, Shoreditch. His mother&#x27;s maiden name was Elizabeth Chilver and she was forty years old when William was born. William&#x27;s middle name, Withey, came from his godfather, Captain Withey, a friend and employer of his father and also a local barge owner. He was the youngest of eight children, two of whom died in infancy. Of William&#x27;s surviving five siblings, two were brothers (John and Joseph) and three were sisters (Elizabeth, Mary and Maria).

When William was about four years old the family moved to Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex. His father died of cholera in London in 1827, when William was ten years old, and was buried at Thorpe-le-Soken. After her husband&#x27;s death, Elizabeth Gull devoted herself to her children&#x27;s upbringing on very slender means. She was a woman of character, instilling in her children the proverb &quot;whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.&quot; William Gull often said that his real education had been given him by his mother. Elizabeth Gull was devoutly religious—on Fridays the children had fish and rice pudding for dinner; during Lent she wore black, and the Saints&#x27; days were carefully observed.

As a young boy, William Gull attended a local day school with his elder sisters. Later, he attended another school in the same parish, kept by the local clergyman. William was a day-boy at this school until he was fifteen, at which age he became a boarder for two years. It was at this time that he first began to study Latin. The clergyman&#x27;s teaching, however, seems to have been very limited; and at seventeen William announced that he would not go any longer.

William now became a pupil-teacher in a school kept by a Mr. Abbott at Lewes, Sussex. He lived with the schoolmaster and his family, studying and teaching Latin and Greek. It was at this time that he became acquainted with Joseph Woods, the botanist, and formed an interest in looking for unusual plant life that would remain a lifelong pastime. His mother, meanwhile, had in 1832 moved to the parish of Beaumont, adjacent to Thorpe-le-Soken. After two years at Lewes, at the age of nineteen, William became restless and started to consider other careers, including working at sea.

The local rector took an interest in William and proposed that he should resume his classical and other studies on alternate days at the rectory. William agreed, and would continue this routine for a year. On his days at home, he and his sisters would row down the estuary to the sea, watching the fishermen, and collecting wildlife specimens from the nets of the coastal dredgers. William would study and catalogue the specimens thus obtained, which he would study using whatever books as he could then procure. This seems to have awoken in him an interest in biological research that would serve him well in his later career in medicine. The wish to study medicine became the fixed desire of his life.

==Early career in medicine==

At about this time the local rector&#x27;s uncle, Benjamin Harrison, the Treasurer of Guy&#x27;s Hospital, was introduced to Gull and was impressed by his ability. He invited him to go to Guy&#x27;s Hospital under his patronage and, in September 1837, the autumn before he was twenty-one, Gull left home and entered on his life&#x27;s work.

It was usual for students of medicine to conduct their studies at the hospital as &quot;apprentices.&quot; The Treasurer&#x27;s patronage provided Gull with two rooms in the hospital with an annual allowance of £50 a year.

Gull, encouraged by Harrison, determined to make the most of his opportunity, and resolved to try for every prize for which he could compete in the hospital in the course of that year. He succeeded in gaining every one. During the first year of his residence at Guy&#x27;s, together with his other studies he carried on his own education in Greek, Latin, and Mathematics, and in 1838 he matriculated at the recently founded University of London. In 1841 he took his M.B. degree, and gained honours in physiology, comparative anatomy, medicine, and surgery.

==Professional career==
In 1842, Gull was appointed to teach materia medica at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, and the Treasurer gave him a small house in King Street, with an annual salary of £100 (£14,500 in 2023). In 1843, he was appointed Lecturer on Natural Philosophy. He also held at this time the post of Medical Tutor at Guy&#x27;s and, in the absence of the staff, shared with Mr. Stocker the care of the patients in the hospital. In the same year, he was appointed Medical Superintendent of the wards for lunatics, and it was largely due to his influence that these cases shortly ceased to be treated at the hospital, and the wards were converted from this use.

Throughout this period, Gull&#x27;s duties gave him extensive opportunities to develop his medical experience. He spent much of his life within the wards of the hospital, at all hours of the day and often at night.

In 1846, he earned his M.D. degree at the University of London, and gained the gold medal. At that time, this was the highest honour in medicine which the University was able to confer. During his M.D. examination, he suffered an attack of nerves and was about to leave the room, saying that he knew nothing of the case proposed for comment; a friend persuaded him to return, with the result that the thesis he then wrote gained for him his Doctor&#x27;s degree and the gold medal.

From 1846 to 1856, Gull held the post of Lecturer on Physiology and Comparative Anatomy at Guy&#x27;s.

In 1847, Gull was elected Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a post which he held for two years, during which time he formed a close friendship with Michael Faraday, at that time Fullerian Professor of Chemistry. In 1848, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He was also appointed Resident Physician at Guy&#x27;s. Dr Gull became a DCL of Oxford in 1868, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1869, LL.D. of the University of Cambridge in 1880 and of the University of Edinburgh in 1884. He was a Crown member of the General Medical Council from 1871 to 1883, and representative of the University of London in the Council from 1886. In 1871 he was elected President of the Clinical Society of London.

==Marriage and family==
On 18 May 1848, Gull married Susan Ann Lacy, daughter of Colonel J. Dacre Lacy, of Carlisle. Shortly afterwards he left his rooms at Guy&#x27;s and moved to 8 Finsbury Square.

They had three children: Caroline Cameron Gull was born in 1851 at Guy&#x27;s Hospital and died in 1929; she married Theodore Dyke Acland MD (Oxon.) FRCP, the son of Sir Henry Acland, 1st Baronet MD FRS. They had two children, a daughter (Aimee Sarah Agnes Dyke Acland) who died in infancy in 1889, and a son, Theodore Acland (1890–1960), who became headmaster of Norwich School.

Cameron Gull was born about 1858 in Buckhold, Pangbourne, Berkshire and died in infancy.

William Cameron Gull was born on 6 January 1860 in Finsbury, Middlesex and died in 1922. He was educated at Eton College, inherited his father&#x27;s title as 2nd Baronet of Brook Street, and later served as the Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) for Barnstaple from July 1895 to September 1900.

==Baronet and Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria==

In 1871, as Physician in Ordinary to the Prince of Wales, Gull took the chief direction of the treatment of the Prince during an attack of typhoid fever.

The Prince of Wales showed the first signs of illness on 13 November 1871, while at the Royal residence at Sandringham House, Norfolk. Initially, he was attended by Dr. Lowe of Kings Lynn and by Oscar Clayton, who thought the fever was caused by a sore on a finger. After a week, with no sign of the fever abating, they diagnosed typhoid fever and sent for Gull on 21 November, and Sir William Jenner on the 23rd. It transpired that the typhoid attack was complicated by bronchitis and the Prince was in danger of his life for many days. For the next month, daily bulletins were issued by Sandringham and posted at police stations around the country. Sir William Hale-White, author of &quot;Great Doctors of the Nineteenth Century&quot; (1935), wrote: &quot;I was a lad then and my father sent me every evening to the police station to get the latest news. It was not until just before Christmas that bulletins were issued only once a day.&quot;

The following passage appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; on 18 December 1871:
After the Prince&#x27;s recovery, a service of thanksgiving was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in the City of London, attended by Queen Victoria. In recognition of his service, on 8 February 1872 William Gull was created the 1st Baronet of the Baronetcy of Brook Street.

The coat of arms is shown left. The Blazon of Arms is:
The Motto is:
Sir William Gull was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria. (At this time, there were four Physicians-in-Ordinary to the Queen, each receiving an annual salary of £200. However, these were largely honorary appointments; in reality, the Queen never saw any of them except the senior physician, then Sir William Jenner, and her resident medical attendant.)

==Support for women in medicine==
In late Victorian Britain, women were not encouraged to enter the medical profession. Sir William Gull was initially against women becoming medics but later stated that he had changed his mind and spoke out against this bias and led efforts to improve the prospects of women who wished to pursue careers in medicine. In February 1886, he chaired a meeting at the Medical Society in Cavendish Square to establish a medical scholarship to be awarded to women. This was the Helen Prideaux Memorial Fund, named after Frances Helen Prideaux M.B. and B.S. Lond, a gifted University of London medical student who had died from diphtheria the previous year, having previously won the exhibition and gold medal in anatomy and gained a first class degree.

Gull was reported as saying that her academic achievements answered any objections to the involvement of women in medicine; and expressed the hope that the scholarship would lead to a liberalisation of attitudes and greater recognition of women across the profession.

The fund was launched with initial donations of £252 9s; Gull&#x27;s personal contribution was 10 guineas (£10 10s). By the mid-1890s, the scholarship was able to support a biannual prize of £50, awarded to a graduate of the London School of Medicine for Women, to assist in completing a further stage of studies.


==Illness and death==
In 1887, Sir William Gull suffered the first of several strokes at his Scottish home at Urrard House, Killiecrankie. The attack of hemiplegia and aphasia was caused by a cerebral haemorrhage, of which the only warning had been unexplained haemoptysis a few days earlier. He recovered after a few weeks and returned to London, but was under no illusions about the danger to his health, remarking &quot;One arrow had missed its mark, but there are more in the quiver&quot;.

Over the next two years, Gull lived at 74 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, London and also had homes at both Reigate and Brighton. During this period, he suffered several further strokes. The fatal attack came at his home in 74, Brook Street, London on 27 January 1890. He died two days later.

&quot;The Times&quot; newspaper carried the following report on 30 January 1890:
The news of Gull&#x27;s death was reported around the world. American author Mark Twain observed in his diary on 1 February 1890:

Sir William Gull was buried on Monday 3 February 1890 next to the grave of his father and mother in the churchyard of his childhood home at Thorpe-le-Soken, near Colchester, Essex. A special train was commissioned to carry mourners from London. The inscription on his headstone was his favourite biblical quote: 

The obituary notice in the Proceedings of the Royal Society reads: 

A memorial bronze plaque was placed at the entrance to Guy&#x27;s Hospital Chapel. The inscription reads:
The vacant position of Physician-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria was filled by Dr. Richard Douglas Powell, the senior of the three Physicians Extraordinary.

==Will, executors and bequests==
Sir William Gull&#x27;s will, with a codicil, was dated 27 November 1888. The value of the estate was £344,022 19s. 7d – an enormous sum at that time.

The following persons were appointed as executors: his wife, Dame Susan Anne Gull, his son, Sir William Cameron Gull, of Gloucester Street, Portman Square (the new baronet), Mr. Edmund Hobhouse, and Mr. Walter Barry Lindley.

Under the terms of the will, £500 was bequeathed to each of the acting executors; £100 to Miss Mary Jackson; £100 to each of two nieces; £200 to Lady Gull&#x27;s maid; £50 to Sir William&#x27;s amanuensis, Miss Susan Spratt; and an annual sum of £32 10s to his butler, William Brown, for the rest of his life. A jewelled snuffbox presented to Sir William Gull by the Empress Eugénie, widow of Emperor Napoleon III of France became an entailed heirloom, along with his presentation plate.

Lady Gull was bequeathed the remainder of his plate, his pictures, furniture, and household effects and the sum of £3,000, along with the use for the remainder of her life of the house at 74 Brook Street. She also received a life annuity of £3,000, commencing 12 months after Sir William&#x27;s death. Sir William&#x27;s daughter Caroline received £26,000 in trust, while his son Sir William Cameron Gull received the sum of £40,000 and all the real estate.

The residue of Sir William&#x27;s personal estate was to be held in trust for the purchase of real estate in England or Scotland (but not in Ireland) which was to be added to the entailed estate.

Unusually, the will is recorded twice in the probate registry, in 1890 and in 1897. The text of the second entry reads:
The words &quot;Double Probate Jan 1897&quot; are written in the margin of the entry.

==Contributions to medical science==

===Anorexia nervosa===
The term &quot;anorexia nervosa&quot; was first established by Sir William Gull in 1873.

In 1868, he had delivered an address to the British Medical Association at Oxford in which he referred to a &quot;peculiar form of disease occurring mostly in young women, and characterised by extreme emaciation&quot;. Gull observed that the cause of the condition could not be determined, but that cases seemed mainly to occur in young women between the ages of sixteen and twenty-three. In this address, Gull referred to the condition as &quot;Apepsia hysterica&quot;, but subsequently amended this to &quot;Anorexia hysterica&quot; and then to &quot;Anorexia nervosa&quot;.

Five years later, in 1873, Gull published his work &quot;Anorexia Nervosa (Apepsia Hysterica, Anorexia Hysterica)&quot;, in which he describes the three cases of Miss A, Miss B, and a third unnamed case. In 1887, he also recorded the case of Miss K, in what was to be the last of his medical papers to be published.

Miss A was referred to Sir William Gull by her doctor, a Mr Kelson Wright, of Clapham, London on 17 January 1866. She was aged 17 and was greatly emaciated, having lost 33 pounds. Her weight at this time was 5 stones 12 pounds (82 pounds); her height was 5 ft 5 inches. Gull records that she had suffered from amenorrhoea for nearly a year, but that otherwise her physical condition was mostly normal, with healthy respiration and heart sounds and pulse; no vomiting nor diarrhoea; clean tongue and normal urine. The pulse was slightly low at between 56 and 60. The condition was that of simple starvation, with total refusal of animal food and almost total refusal of everything else.

Gull prescribed remedies including preparations of cinchona, biochloride of mercury, syrup of iodide of iron, syrup of phosphate of iron, citrate of quinine and variations in diet without noticeable success. He observed occasional voracious appetite for very brief periods, but states that these were very rare and exceptional. He also records that she was frequently restless and active and notes that this was a &quot;striking expression of the nervous state, for it seemed hardly possible that a body so wasted could undergo the exercise which seemed agreeable&quot;.

In Gull&#x27;s published medical papers, images of Miss A are shown that depict her appearance before and after treatment (right). Gull notes her aged appearance at age 17:

It will be noticeable that as she recovered she had a much younger look, corresponding indeed to her age, twenty-one; whilst the photographs, taken when she was seventeen, give her the appearance of being nearer thirty.

Miss A remained under Gull&#x27;s observation from January 1866 to March 1868, by which time she seemed to have made a full recovery, having gained in weight from 82 to 128 pounds.
Miss B was the second case described in detail by Gull in his &quot;Anorexia nervosa&quot; paper. She was referred to Gull on 8 October 1868, aged 18, by her family who suspected tuberculosis and wished to take her to the south of Europe for the coming winter.

Gull noted that her emaciated appearance was more extreme than normally occurs in tubercular cases. His physical examination of her chest and abdomen discovered nothing abnormal, other than a low pulse of 50, but he recorded a &quot;peculiar restlessness&quot; that was difficult to control. The mother advised that &quot;She is never tired&quot;. Gull was struck by the similarity of the case to that of Miss A, even to the detail of the pulse and respiration observations.

Miss B was treated by Gull until 1872, by which time a noticeable recovery was underway and eventually complete. Gull admits in his medical papers that the medical treatment probably did not contribute much to the recovery, consisting, as in the former case, of various tonics and a nourishing diet.

Miss K was brought to Gull&#x27;s attention by a Dr. Leachman, of Petersfield, in 1887. He records the details in the last of his medical papers to be published. Miss K was aged 14 years in 1887. She was the third child in a family of six, one of whom died in infancy. Her father had died, aged 68, of pneumonic phthisis. Her mother was living and in good health; she had a sister who displayed multiple nervous symptoms and an epileptic nephew. With these exceptions, no other neurotic cases were recorded in the family. Miss K, who was described as a plump, healthy girl until the beginning of 1887, began to refuse all food except half cups of tea or coffee in February that year. She was referred to Gull and began to visit him of 20 April 1887; in his notes, he remarks that she persisted in walking through the streets to his house despite being an object of attention to passers-by. He records that she displayed no sign of organic disease; her respiration was 12 to 14; her pulse was 46; and her temperature was . Her urine was normal. Her weight was 4 stone 7 pounds (63 pounds) and her height was 5 feet 4 inches. Miss K expressed herself to Gull as &quot;quite well&quot;. Gull arranged for a nurse from Guy&#x27;s to supervise her diet, ordering light food every few hours. After six weeks, Dr. Leachman reported good progress and by 27 July her mother reported that her recovery was almost complete, with the nurse by this time no longer being needed.

Photographs of Miss K appear in Gull&#x27;s published papers. The first is dated 21 April 1887 and shows the subject in a state of extreme emaciation. The unclothed torso and head is displayed with the ribcage and clavicle clearly visible. The second photograph is dated 14 June 1887 in a similar attitude and shows a clear recovery.

Although the cases of Miss A, Miss B and Miss K resulted in recovery, Gull states that he observed at least one fatality as a result of anorexia nervosa. He states that the post mortem revealed no physical abnormalities other than thrombosis of the femoral veins. Death appeared to have resulted from starvation alone.

Gull observed that slow pulse and respiration seemed to be common factors in all the cases he had observed. He also observed that this resulted in below-normal body temperature and proposed the application of external heat as a possible treatment. This proposal is still debated by scientists today.

Gull also recommended that food should be administered at intervals varying inversely with the periods of exhaustion and emaciation. He believed that the inclination of the patient should in no way be consulted; and that the tendency of the medical attendant to indulge the patient (&quot;Let her do as she likes. Don&#x27;t force food.&quot;), particularly in the early stages of the condition, was dangerous and should be discouraged. Gull states that he formed this opinion after experience of dealing with cases of anoerexia nervosa, having previously himself been inclined to indulge patients&#x27; wishes.

===Gull–Sutton Syndrome (chronic Bright&#x27;s disease)===
In 1872, Sir William Gull and Henry G. Sutton, M.B., F.R.C.P. presented a paper that challenged the earlier understanding of the causes of chronic Bright&#x27;s Disease.

The symptoms of Bright&#x27;s Disease had been described in 1827 by the English physician Richard Bright who, like Gull, was based at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. Dr. Bright&#x27;s work characterised the symptoms as caused by a disease centred on the kidney. Chronic Bright&#x27;s disease was a more severe variant, where other organs are also affected.

In their introduction, Gull and Sutton point out that Dr. Bright and others &quot;have fully recognised that the granular contracted kidney is usually associated with morbid changes in other organs of the body&quot; and that these co-existent changes were commonly grouped together and termed &quot;chronic Bright&#x27;s disease.&quot; The prevailing opinion at the time was that the kidney was the organ primarily affected, inducing a condition that would spread to other parts of the body and thereby cause other organs to suffer.

Gull and Sutton argued that this assumption was incorrect. They presented evidence to show that the diseased state could also originate in other organs, and that the deterioration of the kidney is part of the general morbid change, rather than the primary cause. In some cases examined by Gull and Sutton, the kidney was only marginally affected while the condition was far more advanced in other organs.

Gull and Sutton&#x27;s main conclusion was that the morbid change in the arteries and capillaries was the primary and essential condition of the morbid state known as chronic Bright&#x27;s disease with contracted kidney. They stated that the clinical history may vary according to the organs primarily and chiefly affected; the condition could not be expected to follow a simple and predictable pattern.

===Myxoedema===
In 1873, Sir William Gull delivered a paper alongside his &quot;Anorexia nervosa&quot; work in which he demonstrated that the cause of myxoedema is atrophy of the thyroid gland. This paper, titled &quot;On a cretinoid state supervening in adult life in women&quot; was to be the better known of the two for many years.

The background to Gull&#x27;s work was research performed by Claude Bernard in 1855 around the concept of the Milieu intérieur and subsequently by Moritz Schiff in Bern in 1859, and who showed that thyroidectomy in dogs invariably proved fatal; Schiff later showed that grafts or injections of thyroid reversed the symptoms in both thyroidectomised animals and humans. He thought the thyroid liberated some important substance into the blood. Three years earlier, Charles Hilton Fagge, also of Guy&#x27;s Hospital, had produced a paper on &#x27;sporadic cretinism&#x27;.

Gull&#x27;s paper related the symptoms and changed appearance of a Miss B:
After the cessation of the catamenial period, became insensibly more and more languid, with general increase of bulk ... Her face altering from oval to round ... the tongue broad and thick, voice guttural, and the pronunciation as if the tongue were too large for the mouth (cretinoid) ... In the cretinoid condition in adults which I have seen, the thyroid was not enlarged ... There had been a distinct change in the mental state. The mind, which had previously been active and inquisitive, assumed a gentle, placid indifference, corresponding to the muscular languor, but the intellect was unimpaired ... The change in the skin is remarkable. The texture being peculiarly smooth and fine, and the complexion fair, at a first hasty glance there might be supposed to be a general slight oedema of it ... The beautiful delicate rose-purple tint on the cheek is entirely different from what one sees in the bloated face of renal anasarca.

A few years later, in 1888, this condition would be named myxoedema by W. M. Ord.

===Spinal cord and paraplegia===
Paraplegia is a condition usually resulting from injury to the spinal cord. This was a long-term interest of Gull&#x27;s dating back at least to his three Goulstonian lectures of 1848, titled &quot;On the nervous system&quot;, &quot;Paraplegia&quot; and &quot;Cervical paraplegia – hemiplegia&quot;.

Gull divided paraplegia into three groups: spinal, peripheral, and encephalic, where the spinal group related to paralyses caused by damage to the spinal cord; the peripheral group comprised disorders that occur when multiple parts of the nervous system fail simultaneously; and the encephalic group comprised partial paralyses caused by a failure of the central nervous system, possibly related to failure of the blood supply or a syphilitic condition.

Gull&#x27;s main work on paraplegia was published between 1856 and 1858. Along with the French neurologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, his work enabled paraplegic symptoms to be understood in context with the prevailing, limited understanding of spinal cord pathology, for the first time. He presented a series of 32 cases, including autopsies in 29 instances, to correlate the clinical and pathological features.

He acknowledged, however, that nothing was more difficult than &quot;the determination at the bedside, of the causes&quot;. Pathologically softening and inflammation were sometimes evident, but in many instances no obvious aetiology was found. One might have to seek for &#x27;atomical&#x27; as distinguished from &#x27;anatomical&#x27; causes, he speculated. He described two types of partial lesions, one confined to a segment of the spinal cord, the other extending longitudinally in one of its columns. He noticed and was puzzled by degenerations of the posterior columns that could cause an &#x27;inability to regulate motor power&#x27;.

Gull recognised girdle pain as seldom absent from extrinsic compression, often signifying meningeal involvement. Paralysis of the lower extremities could, he thought, be consequent upon diseases of the bladder and kidneys (&#x27;urinary paraplegia&#x27;). The bladder infection was the source of inflammatory phlebitis extending from pelvic to spinal veins.

Meningitis with myelitis was found and attributed to exposure to cold or fatigue.

In five traumatic cases, the vertebral column was often but not invariably fractured and could compress the cord. He recorded one instance in a 33-year-old woman of a thoracic disk prolapse compressing the cord, without evident trauma. Tumours also figured in seven of his 32 patients; two were metastatic from kidney and lung. Two had intramedullary cervical tumours, and one, a Guy&#x27;s Hospital nurse, probably had a cystic astrocytoma.

Earlier work by the Irish physician Robert Bentley Todd (1847), Ernest Horn, and Moritz Heinrich Romberg(1851) had described Tabes dorsalis and noted atrophy of the spinal cord, but in an important paper, Gull also stressed the involvement of the posterior column in paraplegia with sensory ataxia [12].

&quot;That the course of nature may be varied we have assumed by our meeting here today. The whole object of the science of medicine is based on this assumption&quot;

&quot;I do not know what a brain is, and I do not know what sleep is, but I do know that a well-fed brain sleeps well&quot;
&quot;Quoted in St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Reports, 1916, 52: 45.&quot;

&quot;The foundation of the study of Medicine, as of all scientific inquiry, lies in the belief that every natural phenomenon, trifling as it may seem, has a fixed and invariable meaning&quot;
&quot;Published Writings, &quot;Study of Medicine&quot;&quot;

&quot;If facts be nature&#x27;s words, our words should be true sign of nature&#x27;s facts. A word rightly imposed is a landmark indicating so much recovered from the region of ignorance&quot;
&quot;Published Writings, Volume 156, &quot;Study of Medicine&quot;&quot;

&quot;Never forget that it is not a pneumonia, but a pneumonic man who is your patient. Not a typhoid fever, but a typhoid man&quot;
&quot;Published Writings (edited by T. D. Acland), Memoir II.&quot;

&quot;Realize, if you can, what a paralyzing influence on all scientific inquiry the ancient belief must have had which attributed the operations of nature to the caprice not of one divinity, but of many. There still remains vestiges of this in most of our minds, and the more distinct in proportion to our weakness and ignorance.&quot;

==Links to the 1888 Whitechapel murders==
Sir William Gull features in theories and fictional works in connection with the Whitechapel &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; murders of 1888. These are sometimes associated with variants of conspiracy theories involving the Royal Family and the Freemasons.
===1895–1897 – U.S. newspaper reports===
The earliest known allegation that links the Whitechapel murders with a prominent London physician (not necessarily Gull) was in two articles published by a number of US newspapers between 1895 and 1897.

The first article appeared in the &quot;Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel&quot; (24 April 1895), the &quot;Fort Wayne Weekly Gazette&quot; (25 April 1895) and the &quot;Ogden Standard&quot;, Utah. It reported an alleged conversation between William Greer Harrison, a prominent San Francisco citizen, and a Dr Howard of London. According to Howard, the murderer was a &quot;medical man of high standing&quot; whose wife had become alarmed by his erratic behaviour during the period of the Whitechapel murders. She conveyed her suspicions to some of her husband&#x27;s medical colleagues who, after interviewing him and searching the house, &quot;found ample proofs of murder&quot; and committed him to an asylum.

Variations of the second article appeared in the &quot;Williamsport Sunday Grit&quot; (12 May 1895); the &quot;Hayward Review&quot;, California (17 May 1895); and the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; (28 December 1897). This article comments: &quot;the identity of that incarnate fiend was settled some time ago&quot; and that the murderer was &quot;a demented physician afflicted with wildly uncontrollable erotic mania.&quot; It repeats some of the details in the earlier report, adding that Dr Howard &quot;was one of a dozen London physicians who sat as a commission in lunacy upon their brother physician, for at last it was definitely proved that the dread Jack the Ripper was a physician in high standing and enjoying the patronage of the best society in the West End of London.&quot; The article goes on to allege that the preacher and spiritualist Robert James Lees played a leading role in the physician&#x27;s arrest by using his clairvoyant powers to divine that the Whitechapel murderer lived in a house in Mayfair. He persuaded police to enter the house, the home of a distinguished physician, who was allegedly removed to a private insane asylum in Islington under the name of Thomas Mason. Meanwhile the disappearance of the physician was explained by announcing his death and faking a funeral – &quot;an empty coffin, which now reposes in the family vaults in Kensal Green, is supposed to contain the mortal remains of a great West End physician, whose untimely death all London mourned.&quot; (This detail does not correspond with Sir William Gull, who was buried in the churchyard at Thorpe-le-Soken in Essex.)

The identity of the Dr Howard who is alleged to have provided the information for the first article was never established. On 2 May 1895, the &quot;Fort Wayne Weekly Gazette&quot; published a follow-up quoting William Greer as reaffirming the accuracy of the story, and describing Dr. Howard as a &quot;well-known London physician who passed through San Francisco on a tour of the world several months ago&quot;. A further follow-up article in the &quot;London People&quot; on 19 May 1895, written by Joseph Hatton, identified him as Dr. Benjamin Howard, an American doctor who had practised in London during the late 1880s. The article was shown to Dr. Benjamin Howard on a return visit to London in January 1896, prompting a strong letter of denial published in &quot;The People&quot; on 26 January 1896:

===1970 – &quot;Criminologist&quot; article (Thomas Stowell)===
Dr. Thomas Eldon Alexander Stowell, C.B.E., M.D., F.R.C.S. published an article in &quot;The Criminologist&quot; entitled &quot;&#x27;Jack the Ripper&#x27; – A Solution?&quot;

Stowell was a junior colleague to Dr Theodore Dyke Acland, Gull&#x27;s son-in-law. He alleges that one of Gull&#x27;s patients was the Whitechapel murderer. He refers to the killer as &quot;S&quot; throughout the article without ever identifying him, but the identity of &quot;S&quot; is widely presumed to be Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, Queen Victoria&#x27;s grandson and heir presumptive to the throne. Stowell writes,
Stowell apparently devised his theory using Sir William Gull&#x27;s private papers as his primary source material. However, this cannot be confirmed as Stowell died a few days after publishing his article and his family burned his papers. Gull (who was named in the article) supposedly left papers showing that &quot;S&quot; had not died of pneumonia, as had been reported, but of tertiary syphilis. Stowell states that &quot;S&quot; caught syphilis in the West Indies while touring the world in his late teens and it was this illness that brought on a state of insanity which led to the murders.

He goes on to allege that &quot;S&quot; was certified insane by Gull and placed in a private mental home, from which he escaped and committed the last, and most brutal, murder of Mary Jane Kelly in November 1888. He then recovered sufficiently to take a five-month cruise before his relapse and death &quot;in his father&#x27;s country house&quot; of &quot;bronchopneumonia&quot;.

===1973 – &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (BBC mini-series)===
In 1973, the BBC broadcast &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot;, a six-part mini-series in the docudrama format. The series, scripted by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd, used fictional detectives Detective Chief Inspector Charles Barlow and Detective Inspector John Watt from the police drama &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; to portray an investigation into the Whitechapel murders.

The series did not reach a single conclusion, but is significant for its inclusion of the first public airing of a story propounded by Joseph &quot;Hobo&quot; Sickert, alleged illegitimate son of artist Walter Sickert. This theory alleges that the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, conspired with Queen Victoria and senior Freemasons, including senior police officers, to murder a number of women with knowledge of an illegitimate Catholic heir to the throne sired by Prince Albert Victor. According to this theory, the murders were carried out by Sir William Gull with the assistance of a coachman, John Netley. Sickert himself later retracted the story, in an interview with the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on 18 June 1978. He is quoted as saying, &quot;It was a hoax; I made it all up&quot; and, it was &quot;a whopping fib.&quot;

===1976 – &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; (Stephen Knight)===
Stephen Knight was a reporter for the &quot;East London Advertiser&quot; who interviewed Joseph Sickert following the BBC series. He was sufficiently convinced by the story to write a book – &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; – which proposes the Sickert story as its central conclusion. The book provides the inspiration for a number of fictional works related to the Whitechapel murderers.

Knight undertook his own research, which established that there really was a coachman named John Netley; that an unnamed child was knocked down in the Strand in October 1888 and that a man named &quot;Nickley&quot; attempted suicide by drowning from Westminster Bridge in 1892. He was also provided with access to Home Office files, from which a number of contemporary police reports were made public for the first time.

Knight&#x27;s claim that Sir William Gull, along with various others, was a high-ranking Freemason, is disputed. Knight writes:
This claim is refuted by John Hamill, former Librarian for the Freemasons&#x27; United Grand Lodge of England (subsequently the Director of Communications). Hamill writes:
===Popular culture since 1976===
In 1979, the fictional character Sir Thomas Spivey, portrayed by actor Roy Lansford, appears in &quot;Murder by Decree&quot;, starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Doctor Watson. Sir Thomas Spivey, a Royal physician whose character is based on Sir William Gull, is revealed as the murderer in a plotline based on Stephen Knight&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot;. Spivey is depicted as assisted by a character named William Slade, himself based on John Netley.

A fictionalised Sir William Gull appears in Iain Sinclair&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;White Chappell, Scarlet Tracings&quot; in a plotline based on Stephen Knight&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. &quot;

Sir William Gull is portrayed by Ray McAnally in 1988 in a TV dramatisation of the murders, starring Michael Caine and Jane Seymour. The plotline reveals Sir William Gull as the murderer, assisted by coachman John Netley, but otherwise excludes the main elements of the Royal conspiracy theory.

From 1991 to 1996, a fictionalised Sir William Gull is featured in the graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot; by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell. The plotline depicts Sir William Gull as the murderer and takes Stephen Knight&#x27;s &quot;Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution&quot; as its premise. Eddie Campbell records in his blog, that
The story &quot;Royal Blood&quot; told in &quot;John Constantine, Hellblazer&quot; (1992, DC Comics) mentions Jack the Ripper being Sir William Gull possessed by a demon called Calibraxis.

The fictional character &quot;Sir Nigel Gull&quot; appears in the 1993 novel &quot; The List of Seven &quot; by Mark Frost. &quot;Sir Nigel Gull&quot; is depicted as a Royal physician and appears to be based on Sir William Gull. The plotline has an occult theme that features Prince Edward, Duke of Clarence but does not reference the Whitechapel murders.

The 1997 TV series &quot;Timecop&quot; reveals Gull as the Ripper in its pilot, &quot;A Rip in Time&quot;.

In a 2001 film adaptation of the graphic novel &quot;From Hell&quot;, Sir William Gull is portrayed by Sir Ian Holm.

Actor Peter Penry-Jones portrays Sir William Gull in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder – The Case of Charles Bravo&quot; – a dramatised documentary investigating the unsolved murder of barrister Charles Bravo in 1876.

Gull appears as a character in Brian Catling&#x27;s 2012 novel, &quot;The Vorrh&quot;, where accounts of his relationship with Eadweard Muybridge and work on anorexia are blended into the fantasy narrative.

<text>The Alaska Range is a relatively narrow, mountain range in the southcentral region of the U.S. state of Alaska, from Lake Clark at its southwest end to the White River in Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory in the southeast. Denali, the highest mountain in North America, is in the Alaska Range. The range is part of the American Cordillera.

The Alaska Range is one of the highest mountain ranges in the world, after the Himalayas and the Andes.

==Description==
The range forms a generally east–west arc with its northernmost part in the center, and from there trending southwest towards the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutian Islands, and trending southeast into British Columbia and the Pacific Coast Ranges. The mountains act as a high barrier to the flow of moist air from the Gulf of Alaska northwards, and thus have some of the harshest weather in the world. The heavy snowfall also contributes to a number of large glaciers, including the Cantwell, Castner, Black Rapids, Susitna, Yanert, Muldrow, Eldridge, Ruth, Tokositna, and Kahiltna Glaciers. Four major rivers cross the Alaska Range, including the Delta and Nenana Rivers in the center of the range and the Nabesna and Chisana Rivers to the east.
The range is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, and the Denali Fault that runs along its southern edge is responsible for many major earthquakes. Mount Spurr is a stratovolcano located at the northeastern end of the Aleutian Volcanic Arc which has two vents, the summit and nearby Crater Peak.

Parts of the Alaska Range are protected within Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, Denali National Park and Preserve, and Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. Several highways cross through the passes of the range: the George Parks Highway from Anchorage to Fairbanks via Windy Pass, the Richardson Highway from Valdez to Fairbanks via Isabel Pass, and the Tok Cut-Off from Gulkana Junction to Tok, Alaska via Mentasta Pass. The Alaska Pipeline parallels the Richardson Highway. A part of the Alaska Highway is situated on the northern slopes of the eastern section of the range.

==History==
The name &quot;Alaskan Range&quot; appears to have been first applied to these mountains in 1869 by naturalist W. H. Dall. The name eventually became &quot;Alaska Range&quot; through local use. In 1849 applied the name &quot;Tschigmit&quot; to this mountain range. A map made by the United States General Land Office in 1869 calls the southwestern part of the Alaska Range the &quot;Chigmit Mountains&quot; and the northeastern part the &quot;Beaver Mountains&quot;. However, the Chigmit Mountains are now considered part of the Aleutian Range.

Starting in the mid-1880s to early 1900s, early non-native explorers traversed various sections of the Alaska Range. The first recorded expedition was in the Eastern Alaska Range led by H. T. Allen in 1885. His team went from Suslota Lake to Tetlin Lake and unto the Tanana River via Miles Pass. He noted that it would be possible to build a road from Prince William Sound to the Yukon River. Six years later, Frederick Schwatka and Charles W. Hayes crossed the extreme eastern end of the range via the White River and into the Copper River basin through Skolai Pass in what is now called Saint Elias Mountains. In 1898, W. C. Mendenhall and E. F. Glenn traversed Isabel Pass and were within 15–20 miles of the Tanana River before turning around. Separately, that same year, Robert Muldrow and George Homans Eldridge crossed Broad Pass then Windy Pass into the Nenana River valley.

<doc id="250736" wikidata="Q4993047" url="?curid=250736" title="Richard William Church">
<text>Richard William Church (25 April 1815 – 6 December 1890) was an English churchman and writer, known latterly as Dean Church. He was a close friend of John Henry Newman and allied with the Tractarian movement. Later he moved from Oxford academic life to some prominence in the Church of England.

==Life==
Richard William was the eldest of three sons of John Dearman Church, a wine merchant, and his wife Bromley Caroline Metzener (died 1845). His grandfather Matthew Church, a merchant of Cork, and his wife, were Quakers, and John was not baptised into the Church of England until his marriage in 1814. His uncle, General Sir Richard Church (1784–1873), achieved fame as a liberator of Greece.

The family moved in 1818 to Florence. After his father&#x27;s death in 1828, his mother settled in Bath and he was sent to a strict evangelical school at Redland, Bristol. He was admitted in 1832 to Wadham College, Oxford, and took first-class honours in 1836. His mother, meanwhile, was remarried to Thomas Crokat, a widowed Englishman of Leghorn.

In 1838, Church was elected fellow of Oriel College. One of his contemporaries, Richard Mitchell, commented on his election: &quot;There is such a moral beauty about Church that they could not help taking him.&quot; He was appointed a tutor of Oriel in 1839 and ordained the same year. He was a close friend of John Henry Newman in this period and allied to the Tractarian movement. In 1841 Tract 90 of &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot; appeared and Church resigned his tutorship.

From 1844 to 1845, Church was a junior proctor, and in that capacity and in concert with his senior colleague, vetoed a proposal to censure Tracts publicly. In 1846, with others, he started &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and he was an early contributor to &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;. In 1850 he became engaged to H. F. Bennett, of a Somersetshire family, a niece of George Moberly, Bishop of Salisbury. After again holding the tutorship of Oriel, he accepted in 1858 the small living of Whatley in Somerset near Frome and was married the following year. He was said to be a diligent parish priest and a serious student, who contributed largely to current literature.

==Dean of St Paul&#x27;s==
In 1869, Church declined a canonry at Worcester, but in 1871 accepted reluctantly (calling it &quot;a sacrifice &quot;en pure perte&quot;&quot;), the deanery of St Paul&#x27;s, to which he was nominated by W. E. Gladstone. There his task was complicated:
#Restoration of the cathedral,
#Adjustment of the question of the cathedral revenues with the Ecclesiastical Commissioners,
#Reorganization of a conservative cathedral staff with anomalous vested rights.

Church intended on his appointment &quot;that St Paul&#x27;s should waken up from its long slumber&quot;. The first year he spent there, writes one of his friends, was one of &quot;misery&quot; for a man who loved study and hated pomp and business. But he worked tactfully. Though of unimpressive stature and monotonous, he had a strong influence. He was a High Churchman, but of a rational type, and with an enthusiasm for religious liberty. He said of the Church of England that there was &quot;no more glorious church in Christendom than this inconsistent English Church&quot;. He was regarded in 1882 as a possible successor to Archbishop Tait, but his health made it out of the question. While Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, he was a patron of Saint Martin&#x27;s League for letter carriers.

==Death==
In 1888 Church&#x27;s only son, Frederick John Church (1854–1888), died. Thereafter his own health declined. He appeared for the last time in public at the funeral of Henry Parry Liddon on 9 September 1890, dying on 9 December in the same year, at Dover. He was buried at Whatley.

==Works==
The dean&#x27;s chief published works are &quot;Life of St Anselm&quot; (1870), lives of Spenser (1879) and Bacon (1884) in Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Men of Letters&quot; series, &quot;Dante: an Essay&quot; (1878), &quot;The Oxford Movement&quot; (1891), and many other volumes of essays and sermons. His &quot;Dante: an Essay&quot; included an English version of Dante&#x27;s &quot;De monarchia,&quot; translated by his son Frederick.

A collection of Church&#x27;s journalistic articles was published in 1897 as &quot;Occasional Papers&quot;. His style is lucid but austere. He stated that he had never studied style as such, but had acquired it by the exercise of translation from classical languages, and that he took care in his choice of verbs rather than in his use of adjectives.

<text>The Tarasque is a creature from French mythology. According to the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, the beast had a lion-like head, a body protected by turtle-like carapace(s), six feet with bear-like claws, a serpent&#x27;s tail, and could expel a poisonous breath.

Medieval iconography such as renditions in church sculpture did not necessarily conform to this description in the earlier Gothic period, and examples which seemed to were later assigned later, 14th century dates. The six-footed, turtle-shelled tarasque was the form depicted on the city seal of Tarascon around the 15th century, and this held to be the norm in 16th- and 17th-century paintings. As St. Martha purportedly encountered the beast in the act of swallowing a human victim, it has become a stock motif in art to portray the monster swallowing a human head first, with the victim&#x27;s legs still dangling.

According to tradition, in 1474, René of Anjou initiated the use of the tarasque in the Pentecostal festival, and later used also on the saint&#x27;s feast day of July 29. Yearly celebration in the last weekend of June was added in the modern day. The effigy or float () of the tarasque has been built over the years for parading through town for the occasion, carried by four to a dozen men concealed inside.

The Tarasque was designated one of &quot;Processional Giants and Dragons in Belgium and France&quot; listed in November 2005 as part of UNESCO&#x27;s Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.
== Legend ==


The legend of the Tarasque probably arose in Provence, France, from early to late 12th century. The legend is recorded in several sources, but especially in the story of St. Martha in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (&quot;Legenda aurea&quot;), which was &quot;the most influential&quot;.

=== Legenda aurea ===
In Provence, France, the monster allegedly inhabited the forested banks of the Rhône between Arles and Avignon, around what is now the town Tarascon (then called Nerluc or &#x27;black place&#x27;), but lurked in the river and attacked the men trying to cross it, sinking boats. The creature was described a dragon, half animal, half fish, thicker than an ox, longer than a horse, with &quot;sword-like teeth&quot;.

The Tarasque () was said to have come from Galatia, a cross-breed between the biblical Leviathan and the legendary Onachus (or onacho, or bonacho) of Galatia, this onachus being a creature that retaliated against pursuers by flinging its dung () like an arrow, and causing burns. The people besought Saint Martha for help, and she found the creature in the act of devouring a man. Merely by sprinkling holy water and holding up the cross, she caused the creature to become submissive and obedient. She then tied her girdle (to its neck), leading the beast to the villagers who cast rocks and spears at it until it died.

=== Other sources ===

The account of St. Martha and the tarasque in the &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (&quot;LA&quot;) roughly correspond to the versions of the legend found in the pseudo-Marcella (&quot;V&quot;), and in Vincent de Beauvais&#x27;s &quot;Speculum historiale&quot; (&quot;SH&quot;). are near contemporaneous works (late 12th and 13th century), with the pseudo-Marcella probably being the oldest, and dating &quot;between 1187 and 1212 or 1221&quot;. The three texts LA, SH, and V are similar in content with only modest variations.

There is also a fourth variant Latin account, a &quot;Life of St. Mary Magdalene and her sister St. Martha&quot; (&quot;Vita Beatae Mariae Magdalenae et sororis ejus Sanctae Marthae&quot;) with somewhat divergent content from the other three, whose authorship had formerly been credited to Raban Maur (d. 856 AD), but since rejected as a false attribution, being the work of an unknown author perhaps as early as the late 12th century, or as late as the second half of the 13th century. The work is referred to as the &quot;pseudo-Raban&quot; by Louis Dumont and others.

There is also a brief notice on the tarasque which occurs in Gervase of Tilbury (Gervais de Tilbury). Gervase assigns the habitat of the tarasque () to be an abyss near the city-gates of Arles and the rock/cliff beneath the castle/fort at Tarascon.

== Description ==
As for the description of the tarasque&#x27;s physical appearance given in the &quot;Legenda aurea&quot;, it is given a somewhat dissimilar treatment in the corresponding passage in the c. 1200 pseudo-Marcella:
This description is said to &quot;correspond rather closely&quot; to 17th and 18th century iconography in paintings and woodcuts and to the modern-day effigy. Even the turtle-like carapaces ( &quot;shields&quot;) is attested in this c. 1200 piece of writing, even though some commentators ventured it to be a 15th-century addition, created out of expedience to conceal the men carrying the beast&#x27;s effigy paraded through town for the Pentecostal festivities.

The head has later been described as being similar to a bull and a lion or having the muzzle/face of a lion, or, having the head of a lion with a black mane.

=== Tail ===

The &quot;tail of a serpent&quot; detail is given in both the Pseudo-Marcella and the &quot;Speculum Historiale&quot;. The tail was &quot;long and ringed and looked considerably like that of the scorpion&quot; in a lost sculpture on a face of an old church (Église Sainte-Marthe de Tarascon) according to surgeon-author . It is a ringed tail, and does turns upright as can be verified in facsimile sketch of the sculpture printed by Faillon. Some modern-day authors have gone a step further, claiming the tarasque&#x27;s tail ended in a scorpion sting. Or rather, the tail terminated in a (cock&#x27;s) according to writer Jean-Paul Clébert. There has also been past comment that the tail should end in an arrowhead&#x27;s shape, according to tradition.

=== Poison breath ===
The pseudo-Raban speaks at length of the poisonous fumes exhaled by the tarasque:

Rather than its eyes literally shooting flames, some French sources take it to be a figure of speech, that &quot;its eyes glare sulfurously&quot;. One source (Abbé François Canéto) has Raban Maur stating that the poison breath shot out of the tarasque&#x27;s nostrils in thick vapours.

=== Medieval depictions ===
====Heraldry and numismatics====
The Tarasque is featured on the coat of arms of Tarascon, and here too, the beast/dragon is depicted as devouring a human, at least in later versions of the seal. In 11th or 12th century seals of the city, the tarasque is given an appearance of a crocodile or some sort of amphibian according to one opinion. The city seal from the 13th century appears much as a plain dragon according to one 18th century writer on medieval coats of arms, though Faillon counters that this represents not a dragon guarding the city, but the tarasque. This early type perhaps dates to as far back as the 11th century, seen on seals struck on &quot;méreau&quot; type tokens. The later design of the seal depicting the tarasque with a (turtle-like) carapace appeared in the 15th century.

Later design of the city seal distinctly shows the tarasque swallowing a human. In the language of heraldry, the coat of arms has been described as featuring &quot;below [the castle with crenelated towers argent] a dragon of sinople devouring a man and covered with scales of gold&quot;.

==== Illuminated manuscripts ====
In late medieval manuscripts, the monster is often depicted devouring people.

==== Architecture ====
There are also depictions in architecture.

The aforementioned sculpture once incorporated into the right side exterior of Église Sainte-Marthe de Tarascon purportedly dated to the 11th century, and counted as the oldest representation recorded. This sculpture of the tarasque depicted the beast in the act of devouring a human, in typical fashion. This tarasque was a quadruped that bore close resemblance to the beast trodden underfoot by St. Martha in the paneling sculpture of the choir stalls at Cathédrale Sainte-Marie d&#x27;Auch, according to Abbé François Canéto.
Another example is the carving of a The tarasque in the Montmajour Abbey near Arles.

Yet another is carved in the capital column of the Church of St. Trophime (Église Métropolitaine de Saint-Trophime) in Arles, dating to the mid-14th century, though earlier commentators, such as Faillon who supplied detailed drawings of the capital, considered it to be an example of early Gothic art from the 11th century.

==Festivities==


The festival of the tarasque was initiated on April 14, 1474, during Pentecost in Tarascon, at the behest of René of Anjou, in order to amuse his citizens with a reenactment of St. Martha&#x27;s miracle. Later, a second festival was held on 29 July, the feast-day of Saint Martha.

In former days, the effigy of the tarasque was paraded through the streets twice a year, and a maiden portraying St. Martha escorting the tarasque held it by the leash (or a white ribbon) in one hand.

In the modern day (post-World War II), the festival came to be held annually on the last Sunday of June, to tell the tale of the Tarasque, as well as Tartarin, the main character of Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s &quot;Tartarin of Tarascon&quot;.

=== 19th century descriptions ===

The tarasque paraded through the streets once changed from a wooden prop painted green to a metallic contraption in the early 19th century. Aubin-Louis Millin (1808) described the tarasque effigy as wooden, and consisting of hoops covered in painted cloth. German writer Christian Friedrich Mylius (1818) elaborated that &quot;Every year on the 2nd day of Pentecost, a grotesque wooden likeness of the dragon, or the Tarasque, is carried through the city; it resembles a turtle; it consists of a wooden framework covered with wax canvas, painted apple-green, with gilded hooks and thorns on its back&quot;. A tarasque used in the &quot;jeu de tarasque&quot; during the Pentecostal festival is described by the Count of Villeneuve in 1826, as an effigy of a &quot;monstrous dragon, whose torso is assembled from hoops covered with a painted sheet metal, and whose back is made using a huge shield to imitate a turtle&#x27;s carapace. The paws are clawed, the tail scaly and several times curved, the head is like a bull and a lion. A gaping mouth reveals several rows of teeth&quot;.

The wooden hull described in 1818 required eight men to carry, the metallic version needed 12 men. The tarasque of the festival of 1846 concealed four porters inside, and the one in 1861 needed six men.

The head could be manipulated by a person inside, making the effigy&#x27;s jaws open or close; from out of its nostrils fuses or rockets were made to poke out and ignited so it issued fiery sparks.

During the festival, while the huge effigy of the Tarasque is carried through the streets, there are shouted the traditional cries for the in a popular song attributed to King René of Anjou:

It later became established that the &quot;jeu de Tarasque&quot; would commence at Pentecost and continue to the feast day of Saint Martha on July 29, or the festival was held on those two days as two acts.

=== Modern-day effigy ===

By the 20th century, the tarasque effigy used in Tarascon was mounted on a wheeled cart, which are dragged or pulled by persons known as &quot;Tarascaïres&quot;, and these attendants of the tarasque could intermittently break off and engage in dance (farandole).

=== Dates of observation ===
In the past, the festivals were only held sporadically in a major way, e.g., in the years 1846, 1861, 1891 and 1946 but since 1946 they have become a yearly event and tourist attraction.

In the gap years (first half of the 20th century) when the &quot;jeu de Tarasque&quot; was in hiatus, different authorities were claiming different weeks and weekdays around Pentecost Sunday for the proper day for the ceremony, according to Eliza Gutch (d. 1931)&#x27;s paper, published posthumously.

A tarasque feast was held on a non-traditional day on 23 June 1946 in Tarascon, for practical reasons. Subsequently, the holding of the tarasque festival in this last Sunday or weekend of June became annually recurrent.

The Tarasque was designated one of &quot;Processional Giants and Dragons in Belgium and France&quot; listed in November 2005 as part of UNESCO&#x27;s Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

=== In Spain ===

The Tarasca (Spanish for Tarasque) is one of the statues of the Corpus Christi procession, paraded through a number of Spanish cities, and elsewhere throughout the Iberian peninsula, for example, the cities of Granada, Toledo, and Valencia, and the city of Madrid.

The first record of the tarasca legend in the peninsula comes from Seville in the year 1282, shortly after the &quot;reconquista&quot; of the city in the mid-13th century.

The Spanish version is tinged with misogynistic elements, or rather repudiations against biblical and historical temptresses, with statues and statuettes of such female figures (called &quot;&quot;) surmounted on top of the tarasca dragon. The figure atop the Granada dragon is a life-size doll resembling a retail store mannequin, and the tiny blonde-hair figurine set atop the papier-mâché tarasca of Toledo is supposed to represent Anne Boleyn.

Historically in the city of Seville, it was originally a young boy called a (rather than a modeled figure) who was seated atop the processional dragon. But in 1637 the boy was replaced by a well-adorned woman, and in 1639 it was prescribed that she should be an ugly old woman.

The word &quot;tarasca&quot; has entered the Spanish vocabulary in the sense of an ill-natured woman, or a &quot;hussy&quot;. A 19th-century dictionary defines the tarasca as a &quot;crooked, ugly, lewd, and impudent woman&quot;, and the word is known to have been used in the sense of &quot;ugly old woman&quot; in the 16th century.

== Theories ==

=== Celtic origin hypothesis ===
A pre-Christian Celtic origin for the legend has been proposed, and endorsed by some writers.

French archeologist Isidore Gilles proposed the pre-Christian pagan origins for the legend of the tarasque, and connected with the so-called &quot;tarasque of Noves&quot;, unearthed at the village Noves, once called &quot;Tarasconnet&quot;. The find was a stone statue of a sharp-toothed chimeric beast with a scaly back, &quot;crunching a human arm in its mouth&quot;. Gilles postulated this was a Celtic deified beast to which human sacrifices were offered.

Gilles&#x27;s theory was embraced by the Provençal poet Frederic Mistral, and Dumont was disinclined to dismiss Mistral&#x27;s belief altogether. French scholar also states that the Saint Martha legend is undoubtedly &quot;superimposed on old beliefs of Celtic paganism&quot;.

=== Parallels ===

Parallels have been drawn with the French legends of the Graouilli in Metz, and the Gargouille of Rouen defeated by St. Romanus.

A legendary dragon or dragon-like marine creature reported to have appeared in Vietnam&#x27;s Halong Bay has been called the &quot;Tarasque&quot; after the famed creature of Tarascon.

<text>George Croom Robertson (10 March 1842 – 20 September 1892) was a Scottish philosopher. He sat on the Committee of the National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage and his wife, Caroline Anna Croom Robertson was a college administrator.

==Biography==
He was born in Aberdeen. In 1857 he gained a bursary at Marischal College, and graduated MA in 1861, with the highest honours in classics and philosophy. In the same year he won a Fergusson scholarship of £100 a year for two years, which enabled him to pursue his studies outside Scotland. He went first to University College, London; at the University of Heidelberg he worked on his German; at the Humboldt University in Berlin he studied psychology, metaphysics and also physiology under Emil du Bois-Reymond, and heard lectures on Hegel, Kant and the history of philosophy, ancient and modern. After two months at the University of Göttingen, he went to Paris in June 1863. In the same year he returned to Aberdeen and helped Alexander Bain with the revision of some of his books.

In 1864 he was appointed to help William Duguid Geddes with his Greek classes, but he devoted his vacations to working on philosophy. In 1866 he was appointed professor of philosophy of mind and logic at University College, London. He remained there until he was forced by ill-health to resign a few months before his death, lecturing on logic, deductive and inductive, systematic psychology and ethics.

He left little published work. A comprehensive work on Hobbes was never completed, though part of the materials were used for an article in the Encyclopædia Britannica, and another portion was published as one of Blackwood&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Classics.&quot; Together with Bain, he edited George Grote&#x27;s &quot;Aristotle&quot;, and was the editor of &quot;Mind&quot; from its foundation in 1876 until 1891.
Robertson had a keen interest in German philosophy, and took every opportunity to make German works on English writers known in the United Kingdom. In philosophy he was a follower of Bain and John Stuart Mill. He and his wife, the college administrator Caroline Anna Croom Robertson, were involved in social work; he sat on the Committee of the National Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, and was actively associated with its president, John Stuart Mill. He also supported the admission of women students to University College.

He died in 1892, joining his wife who died earlier that year.

<doc id="250748" wikidata="Q440203" url="?curid=250748" title="Elmer A. Benson">
<text>Elmer Austin Benson (September 22, 1895 March 13, 1985) was an American lawyer and politician from Minnesota. In 1935, Benson was appointed to the U.S. Senate following the death of Thomas Schall. He served as the 24th governor of Minnesota, defeating Republican Martin Nelson in a landslide in Minnesota&#x27;s 1936 gubernatorial election. He lost the governorship two years later to Republican Harold Stassen in the 1938 gubernatorial election.

==Education==
Born in 1895 in Appleton, Minnesota, Benson studied law at William Mitchell College of Law (then the St. Paul College of Law) and served for a year in the U.S. Army during World War I. He never practiced law after returning from active duty, choosing instead to pursue a banking and business career.

==Olson&#x27;s ally==
Benson was a close ally of Governor Floyd B. Olson, another member of the Farmer-Labor Party, who helped orchestrate Benson&#x27;s political rise. Olson appointed Benson state Commissioner of Securities before choosing him to replace Thomas D. Schall in the United States Senate after Schall&#x27;s death in December 1935. Benson served in the 74th congress, until November 3, 1936.

==Governor of Minnesota==
After Olson&#x27;s premature death from cancer in 1936 and the interregnum of Lieutenant Governor Hjalmar Petersen, Benson stepped into the breach and was elected the 24th governor of Minnesota by the largest margin in state history. He served as the 24th governor of Minnesota from January 4, 1937, to January 2, 1939. His defeat by a record margin in 1938 is seen as the beginning of the end of the Farmer-Labor Party as an independent political force and a setback for progressive politics in Minnesota. In 1940, he ran for the United States Senate against Henrik Shipstead, an incumbent senator who defected from the Farmer-Labor Party to join the Republicans. Benson took second place, receiving 25% of the vote, in a race that also involved a Democrat, while Shipstead was reelected. He ran for the Senate for the last time in 1942, losing to Republican Joseph H. Ball in a four-way race.

==DFL Party==
Benson was also the chief figure behind a schism within the DFL Party in Minnesota between 1946 and 1948. The DFL (Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party) had been created in 1944 with the merging of the Minnesota Democratic Party and the Farmer-Labor Party. Benson and his supporters actively took control of the party&#x27;s main committee in 1946, but were displaced by the supporters of Hubert H. Humphrey (then the mayor of Minneapolis) in 1948. The influence of Humphrey and his supporters had grown significantly within the party between 1946 and 1948 due to Humphrey&#x27;s popularity and his work through the ADA, the state farm co-ops, and support from the national arm of the CIO. Humphrey&#x27;s group of supporters—which included such future DFL political stars as Arthur Naftalin, Orville Freeman, and Walter Mondale—wrested control of the DFL from Benson&#x27;s supporters at a February 1948 party convention. Humphrey&#x27;s later successful Senate campaign signaled a significant victory for his faction within the fledgling DFL Party and the defeat of Benson&#x27;s candidates in the DFL primaries. The 1948 schism eventually led Benson and his supporters to leave the DFL.

==Death==
Before ill health drove him from the public arena, Benson became a force within the short-lived Progressive Party, managing the 1948 presidential campaign of its candidate, Henry Wallace. Benson died in 1985 in Minneapolis, and is buried at the Appleton Cemetery in the town of his birth, Appleton, Minnesota.

<doc id="250750" wikidata="Q194339" url="?curid=250750" title="Bahamian dollar">
<text>The dollar (sign: [[Dollar sign|$]]; code: BSD) has been the currency of The Bahamas since 1966. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign &quot;$&quot;, or alternatively B$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is divided into 100 cents.

On 20 October 2020, the Bahamas became the first country to have a legal digital currency, introducing the &quot;Sand Dollar&quot; as an alternative to the traditional Bahamian dollar.

==Relationship with the US dollar==

The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the US dollar on a one-to-one basis. The Central Bank of The Bahamas states that it uses reserve requirements, changes in the Bank discount rate and selective credit controls, supplemented by moral suasion, as main instruments of monetary policy. The Central Bank&#x27;s objective is to keep stable conditions, including credit, in order to maintain the parity between the US dollar and the Bahamian dollar while allowing economic development to proceed.

Although the US dollar (as any other foreign currency) is subject to exchange control laws in The Bahamas, the parity between Bahamian dollars and US dollars means that any business will accept either US or Bahamian currency and many of the businesses that serve tourists have extra US dollars on hand for the convenience of American tourists.

==History==

The dollar replaced the pound at a rate of 1 dollar = 7 shillings (US$0.98) in 1966, 7 years before independence. This rate allowed the establishment of parity with the US dollar, due to the sterling/dollar rate then being fixed at £1 = $2.80, after a slight revaluation of 2%. To aid in decimalisation, three-dollar bills and fifteen-cent coins were created, as three dollars was roughly equivalent to one pound, and fifteen cents to a shilling, at the time of transition.

On 20 October 2020, the Bahamas became the first country to have a legal digital currency, introducing the &quot;Sand Dollar&quot; as an alternative to the traditional Bahamian dollar.

==Coins==


In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50 cents, 1 and 2 dollars. The 1 cent was struck in nickel-brass, the 5, 10, and 15 cent in cupronickel, the 25 cent in nickel, and the 50 cent and 1 dollar in silver. The 10 cent was scallop shaped, whilst the 15 cent was square. Silver coins were not issued for circulation after 1966. Bronze replaced nickel-brass in the 1 cent in 1970, followed by brass in 1974 and copper-plated zinc in 1985. In 1989, cupro-nickel 50 cent and 1 dollar coins were issued for circulation, although they did not replace the corresponding banknotes.

The now-obsolete 1 cent coin is about the size of a US dime, and the 5 and 25 cent coins are about the same size as their US counterparts but with different metal compositions. The 15 cent coins are still produced by the Central Bank. All coins now bear the Bahamian Coat of Arms on one side with the words &quot;Commonwealth of The Bahamas&quot; and the date. The reverses of the coins show objects from Bahamian culture with the value of the coins in words. The 1 cent has three starfish, the 5 cent a pineapple, the 10 cent two bonefish, the 15 cent a hibiscus, and the 25 cent a native sloop.

One-cent coins were last issued on January 31, 2020 and demonetised at the end of 2020. All cash transactions in the Bahamas are now rounded to the nearest five cents.

==Banknotes==
In 1966, the government introduced notes in denominations of , 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollars. The Bahamas Monetary Authority took over the issuance of paper money in 1968, issuing the same denominations. The Central Bank of the Bahamas was established on 1 June 1974 and took over note issuance from that point forward. Its first issue of notes did not include the and 3 dollar denominations but these were reintroduced in 1984.

The dollar has undergone several revisions in the last twenty years, one of the more notable being an extremely colourful redesign in celebration of the quincentennial of the landing of Christopher Columbus on a Bahamian island he named San Salvador.

All banknotes other than the fifty cent note have been undergoing design changes to foil forgery in recent years, although the notes implemented more stringent security long before the US&#x27;s recent redesign of their notes. All banknotes are the same physical size, like the US dollar but unlike the euro. The latest counterfeit-proof formula is the &quot;Counterfeit Resistant Integrated Security Product&quot;, or CRISP. The new banknote was released on 5 August 2005, while the banknote was released on 6 September 2006. In October 2005, someone counterfeited one of the new CRISP bills, serial number A161315. Bahamian authorities warned merchants to look for banknotes that lacked the distinctive watermark.

Until 1992, all notes displayed a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II (Head of State) but notes began to display portraits of prominent deceased Bahamian politicians. This policy is now being reversed, with the return of the Queen&#x27;s portrait to the note. The $ shows an older Queen Elizabeth II and the back shows a picture of Sister Sarah in the Nassau Straw Market; the shows Sir Lynden Pindling and on the back the Royal Bahamas Police Force Band; the has a young Queen Elizabeth II and on the back shows a Family Island Regatta with native sloops; the – Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield and the back shows a Junkanoo group &#x27;rushing&#x27; in the Junkanoo parade; the – an older Queen Elizabeth II (replacing Sir Stafford Sands) and the back shows the Hope Town Lighthouse and settlement in Abaco, the – Sir Milo Butler; the – Sir Roland Symonette; the – an older Queen Elizabeth II and the back shows a jumping blue marlin, the national fish of The Bahamas. For this reason, the Bahamian bill is often referred to by locals as &quot;a blue marlin&quot;.

Since 2016, a new series called &quot;CRISP Evolution&quot; has been progressively introduced, maintaining the subjects and motifs of the previous banknotes while updating the security features and color schemes. The series began with the on 28 September 2016 and includes the from 27 September 2017, the from September 2018, the $ from 24 January 2019, the note from 28 March 2019, the note from 3 October 2019, the note from 23 September 2020 and the note on 6 October 2021.

Due to the $10 banknote being similar in colour to the $1 banknote, the $10 banknote in this series was updated to have a grey colour on 15 December 2022.

<text>Emil Heinrich du Bois-Reymond (7 November 1818 – 26 December 1896) was a German physiologist, the co-discoverer of nerve action potential, and the developer of experimental electrophysiology. His lectures on science and culture earned him great esteem during the latter half of the 19th century.

==Life==
Du Bois-Reymond was born in Berlin and spent his life there. His younger brother was the mathematician Paul du Bois-Reymond (1831–1889). His father was a poor immigrant from Neuchâtel, and his mother was a Berliner of prominent Huguenot origin.

Educated first at the French College in Berlin, du Bois-Reymond enrolled in the University of Berlin in 1838. He seems to have been uncertain at first as to the topic of his studies, for he was a student of the renowned ecclesiastical historian August Neander, and dallied with Naturphilosophie, geology, and physics, but eventually began to study medicine with such zeal and success as to attract the notice of Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858), a well-known professor of anatomy and physiology.

Müller&#x27;s earlier studies had been distinctly physiological, but his preferences caused him later to study comparative anatomy. He had, about the time when the young du Bois-Reymond came to his lectures, published his &quot;Elements of Physiology&quot;, which contains the following statement:

Though there appears to be something in the phenomena of living beings which cannot be explained by ordinary mechanical, physical or chemical laws, much may be so explained, and we may without fear push these explanations as far as we can, so long as we keep to the solid ground of observation and experiment.

In 1840 Müller made du Bois-Reymond his assistant in physiology, and as the beginning of an inquiry gave him a copy of the essay which the Italian physicist Carlo Matteucci had just published on the electric phenomena of animals. This determined the work of du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s life. He chose as the subject of his graduation thesis &quot;Electric fishes,&quot; and so commenced a long series of investigations on bioelectricity. The results of these inquiries were made known partly in papers communicated to scientific journals, but also and chiefly by his work &quot;Investigations of Animal Electricity&quot;, the first part of which was published in 1848, the last in 1884.

In 1852 while living alone and unable to get a professorship he traveled to England and met his second cousin Jeannette Claude, whom he courted and married in 1853. The couple had ten children, one of whom died in infancy.

Concerning religious belief, du Bois-Reymond was an atheist.

==Works==

&quot;Investigations of Animal Electricity&quot; may be seen in two ways. On the one hand, it is a record of the exact determination and approximative analysis of the electric phenomena presented by living beings. Viewed from this standpoint, it represents a significant advance in biological knowledge. Du Bois-Reymond built up this branch of science, by inventing or improving methods, by devising new instruments of observation, or by adapting old ones. On the other hand, the volumes in question contain an exposition of a theory of bioelectricity. In them Du Bois-Reymond put forward a general conception that a living tissue, such as muscle, might be regarded as composed of a number of electric molecules, and that the electric behavior of the muscle was the product of these elementary units. We now know that these are sodium, potassium and other ions, the gradients of which are responsible for maintaining membrane potentials in excitable cells.

His theory was soon criticized by several contemporary physiologists, such as Ludimar Hermann, who maintained that intact living tissue such as muscle does not generate electric currents unless it has suffered injury. The subsequent controversy was ultimately resolved in 1902 by du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s student Julius Bernstein, who incorporated parts of both theories into an ionic model of action potential. Thus, du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s work focused on animal electricity, although he made other physiological inquiries — such as could be studied by physical methods — concerning the phenomena of diffusion, the muscular production of lactic acid, and the development of shocks by electric fishes.

Du Bois-Reymond exerted great influence as a teacher. In 1858, upon the death of Johannes Müller, the professorship of anatomy and physiology at the University of Berlin was divided into a professorship of human and comparative anatomy, which was given to Karl Bogislaus Reichert (1811–1883), and a professorship of physiology, which was given to du Bois-Reymond. This he held until his death, performing research for many years without adequate accommodation. In 1877, the Prussian government granted his wish and provided the university with a modern physiological laboratory.

In 1851 du Bois-Reymond was admitted to the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in 1876 he became its perpetual secretary. Like his friend Hermann von Helmholtz, who had also studied under Johannes Peter Müller, du Bois-Reymond was known throughout Germany. He used his influence for the advancement of science, introducing the theories of thermodynamics and Darwin to students at the University of Berlin. He owed the largest part of his fame, however, to occasional discourses on literature, history, and philosophy.

==Oratory==
===On nationalism===
Following France&#x27;s declaration of war on Prussia on 3 August 1870, du Bois-Reymond proclaimed that &quot;the University of Berlin, quartered opposite the King&#x27;s palace, is, by the deed of its foundation, the intellectual bodyguard (geistige Leibregiment) of the House of Hohenzollern.&quot; But by the time of France&#x27;s surrender on 26 January 1871 du Bois-Reymond had come to regret his words, lamenting the &quot;national hatred of two embittered peoples.&quot; His 1878 lecture &quot;On National Feeling&quot; expanded on this topic, offering one of the earliest analyses of nationalism after those of Lord Acton and Fustel de Coulanges.

=== On history ===
In 1877 du Bois-Reymond presented a view of the past that highlighted science as the sole endeavor that demonstrated any improvement. &quot;Science is the chief instrument of civilization,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and the history of science the essential history of humanity.” In 1936 his argument was repeated by George Sarton in a lecture inaugurating a seminary in the history of science at Harvard University:&quot;Definition&quot;. Science is systematized positive knowledge, or what has been taken as such at different ages and in different places.

&quot;Theorem&quot;. The acquisition and systematization of positive knowledge are the only human activities which are truly cumulative and progressive.

&quot;Corollary&quot;. The history of science is the only history which can illustrate the progress of mankind. In fact, progress has no definite and unquestionable meaning in other fields than the field of science.One historiographer described du Bois-Reymond&#x27;s attention to the history of science as &quot;the first and indeed the most decisive attack on established historical scholarship&quot; in the 19th century.

=== On Darwinism ===
Du Bois-Reymond was the first German professor to convert to Darwinism. He expounded the theory in popular classes at the University of Berlin, in itinerant lectures in the Ruhr and the Rhineland, and in formal addresses translated and reprinted across Europe and North America. Unlike his rival Ernst Haeckel, du Bois-Reymond espoused a mechanistic interpretation of natural selection that anticipated modern views. Few in Germany took offense at his teachings until 1883, when his obituary to Darwin outraged conservatives and Catholics.

===On epistemology===
In 1880 du Bois-Reymond delivered a speech to the Berlin Academy of Sciences enumerating seven &quot;world riddles&quot; or &quot;shortcomings&quot; of science:

# the ultimate nature of matter and force;
# the origin of motion;
# the origin of life;
# the &quot;apparently teleological arrangements of nature&quot; (not an &quot;absolutely transcendent riddle&quot;);
# the origin of simple sensations (&quot;a quite transcendent&quot; question);
# the origin of intelligent thought and language (which might be known if the origin of sensations could be known); and
# the question of free will.
Concerning numbers 1, 2 and 5 he proclaimed &quot;Ignorabimus&quot; (&quot;we will never know&quot;). Concerning number 7 he proclaimed &quot;Dubitemus&quot; (&quot;we doubt it&#x27;).

<text>Thomas Mozley (180617 June 1893), was an English clergyman and writer associated with the Oxford Movement.

==Early life==
Mozley was born at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, the son of a bookseller and publisher. His brother, James Bowling Mozley, would become known for his own theological works. From Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Gainsborough and Charterhouse School he progressed to Oriel College, Oxford in 1825, where he became the pupil, and subsequently the great friend, of John Henry Newman. In 1831 he was ordained, after which he became curate of Colchester, leaving a year later to take over the rectorship of Moreton Pinkney. He asked to leave four years later and in 1836 became rector of Cholderton, Wiltshire. In September of that year, he married Newman&#x27;s younger sister Harriet, creating a family connection to his mentor.

==Tractarian==
From the beginning, Mozley was a strong supporter of the Tractarian movement. After contributing for some time to the &quot;British Critic&quot;, its periodical, Mozley succeeded Newman as editor in July 1841.

In 1843 he was on the point of joining the Roman Catholic Church. Newman, however, strongly advised him to take two years to reflect, and Mozley decided to remain an Anglican. In 1844 he began to write leading articles for &quot;The Times&quot;, and continued to do so regularly for many years. Newman&#x27;s own conversion to Catholicism in 1845 broke the connection between Mozley and Newman, who stopped their correspondence.

In 1847 Mozley resigned from his country living and settled in London.

==Later life==
In 1868 he accepted the living of Plymtree in Devon. Mozley published his &quot;Letters From Rome&quot;, from 1869 to 1870, covering the convening of Vatican I. From 1876 to 1880 he was rural dean of Ottery St Mary, Devon.
He retired in 1880, and moved to Cheltenham, where he died.

==Works==
Mozley was the author of &quot;Reminiscences, Chiefly of Oriel, and the Oxford Movement&quot;, published in 1882, which details a history of the Oxford Movement and Mozley&#x27;s own connection to it. Critical reception of the work has been mixed.

Other works were:

* &quot;Henry VII, Prince Arthur, and Cardinal Morton, from a Group representing the Adoration of the Three Kings on the Chancel Screen of Plymtree Church&quot;, 1878. 
* &quot;Reminiscences, chiefly of Towns, Villages, and Schools&quot;, 2 vols., 1885.
* &quot;The Word&quot;, 1889.
* &quot;The Son&quot;, 1891.
* &quot;Letters from Rome on the Occasion of the Œcumenical Council, 1869-1870&quot;, 2 vols., 1891.
* &quot;The Creed, or a Philosophy&quot;, 1893, with a short autobiographical preface.

Mozley also published a &quot;Letter to the Rev. Canon Bull&quot;, 1882, and contributed to the &quot;British Critic&quot;, and other periodicals, besides &quot;The Times&quot;.

<text>The American black duck (Anas rubripes) is a large dabbling duck in the family Anatidae. It was described by William Brewster in 1902. It is the heaviest species in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, weighing on average and measuring in length with an wingspan. It somewhat resembles the female and eclipse male mallard in coloration, but has a darker plumage. The male and female are generally similar in appearance, but the male&#x27;s bill is yellow while the female&#x27;s is dull green with dark marks on the . It is native to eastern North America. During the breeding season, it is usually found in coastal and freshwater wetlands from Saskatchewan to the Atlantic in Canada and the Great Lakes and the Adirondacks in the United States. It is a partially migratory species, mostly wintering in the east-central United States, especially in coastal areas.

It interbreeds regularly and extensively with the mallard, to which it is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.

The American black duck is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although some populations of the species are in decline. It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
American ornithologist William Brewster described the American black duck as &quot;Anas obscura rubripes&quot;, for &quot;red-legged black duck&quot;, in his landmark article &quot;An undescribed form of the black duck (&quot;Anas obscura&quot;),&quot; in &quot;The Auk&quot; in 1902, to distinguish between the two kinds of black ducks found in New England. One of them was described as being comparatively small, with brownish legs and an olivaceous or dusky bill, and the other as being comparatively larger, with a lighter skin tone, bright red legs and a clear yellow bill. The larger of the two was described as &quot;Anas obscura&quot; by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 in the 13th edition of the &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, Part 2, and he based it on the &quot;Dusky Duck&quot; of Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. The current scientific name, &quot;Anas rubripes&quot;, is derived from Latin, with &quot;Anas&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;rubripes&quot; coming from &quot;ruber&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;.

Pennant, in &quot;Arctic Zoology&quot;, Volume 2, described this duck as coming &quot;from the province of New York&quot; and having &quot;a long and narrow dusky bill, tinged with blue: chin white: neck pale brown, streaked downwards with dusky lines.&quot; In a typical &quot;obscura&quot;, characteristics such as greenish black, olive green or dusky olive bill; olivaceous brown legs with at most one reddish tinge; the nape and pileum nearly uniformly dark; spotless chin and throat; fine linear and dusky markings on the neck and sides of the head, rather than blackish, do not vary with age or season.

==Description==

The American black duck weighs and measures in length with a wingspan. This species has the highest mean body mass in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;, with a sample of 376 males averaging and 176 females averaging , although its size is typically quite similar to that of the familiar mallard. The American black duck somewhat resembles the female mallard in coloration, although the black duck&#x27;s plumage is darker. Males and females are generally similar in appearance, but the male&#x27;s bill is yellow while the female&#x27;s is dull green with dark marks on the , which is occasionally flecked with black. The head is brown, but is slightly lighter in tone than the darker brown body. The cheeks and throat are streaked brown, with a dark streak going through the crown and dark eye. The speculum feathers are iridescent violet-blue with predominantly black margins. The fleshy orange feet of the duck have dark webbing.

Both male and female American black ducks produce similar calls to their close relative, the mallard, with the female producing a loud sequence of &quot;quack&quot;s which falls in pitch.

In flight, the white lining of the underwings can be seen in contrast to the blackish underbody and upperside. The purple speculum lacks white bands at the front and rear, and rarely has a white trailing edge. A dark crescent is visible on the median underwing primary coverts.

Juveniles resemble adult females, but have broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked rather than scalloped appearance, and the overall appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile females have brownish feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The American black duck is endemic to eastern North America. In Canada, the range extends from northeastern Saskatchewan to Newfoundland and Labrador. In the United States, it is found in northern Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Connecticut, Vermont, South Dakota, central West Virginia, Maine and on the Atlantic coast to North Carolina.

The American black duck is a habitat generalist as it is associated with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.

== Behavior ==

=== Feeding ===
The American black duck is an omnivorous species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling in shallow water and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes a wide variety of wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.

During the breeding season, the diet of the American black duck consists of approximately 80% plant food and 20% animal food. The animal food diet increases to 85% during winter. During nesting, the proportion of invertebrates increases. Ducklings mostly eat water invertebrates for the first 12 days after hatching, including aquatic snowbugs, snails, mayflies, dragonflies, beetles, flies, caddisflies and larvae. After this, they shift to seeds and other plant food.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding habitat includes alkaline marshes, acid bogs, lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, brackish marshes and the margins of estuaries and other aquatic environments in northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, across Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic Canadian Provinces, plus the Great Lakes and the Adirondacks in the United States. It is partially migratory, and many winter in the east-central United States, especially coastal areas; some remain year-round in the Great Lakes region. This duck is a rare vagrant to Great Britain and Ireland, where over the years several birds have settled in and bred with the local mallard. The resulting hybrid can present considerable identification difficulties.

Nest sites are well-concealed on the ground, often in uplands. Egg clutches have six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells and come in varied shades of white and buff green. On average, they measure long, wide and weigh . Hatching takes 30 days on average. The incubation period varies, but usually takes 25 to 26 days. Both sexes share duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.

The American black duck interbreeds regularly and extensively with the mallard, to which it is closely related. Some authorities even consider the black duck to be a subspecies of the mallard instead of a separate species. Mank et al. argue that this is in error as the extent of hybridization alone is not a valid means to delimitate &quot;Anas&quot; species.

It has been proposed that the American black duck and the mallard were formerly separated by habitat preference, with the American black duck&#x27;s dark plumage giving it a selective advantage in shaded forest pools in eastern North America, and the mallard&#x27;s lighter plumage giving it an advantage in the brighter, more open prairie and plains lakes. According to this view, recent deforestation in the east and tree planting on the plains has broken down this habitat separation, leading to the high levels of hybridization now observed. However, rates of past hybridization are unknown in this and most other avian hybrid zones, and it is merely presumed in the case of the American black duck that past hybridization rates were lower than those seen today. Also, many avian hybrid zones are known to be stable and longstanding despite the occurrence of extensive interbreeding. The American black duck and the local mallard are now very hard to distinguish by means of microsatellite comparisons, even if many specimens are sampled. Contrary to this study&#x27;s claims, the question of whether the American haplotype is an original mallard lineage is far from resolved. Their statement, &quot;Northern black ducks are now no more distinct from mallards than their southern conspecifics&quot; only holds true in regard to the molecular markers tested. As birds indistinguishable according to the set of microsatellite markers still can look different, there are other genetic differences that were simply not tested in the study.

In captivity studies, it has been discovered that the hybrids follow Haldane&#x27;s rule, with hybrid females often dying before they reach sexual maturity, thereby supporting the case for the American black duck being a distinct species.

=== Nest predators and hazards ===
The nest predators of the American black duck include American crows, gulls and raccoons, especially in tree nests. Hawks and owls are also major predators of adults. Bullfrogs and snapping turtles eat many ducklings. Ducklings often catch diseases caused by protozoan blood parasites transmitted by bites of insects such as blackflies. They are also vulnerable to lead shot poisoning, known as plumbism, due to their bottom-foraging food habits.

==Status and conservation==
Since 1988, the American black duck has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because the range of this species is extremely large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast enough to make the species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck&#x27;s population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has continued to purchase and manage habitat in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations of the American black duck. In addition, the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge has purchased and restored over 1,000 acres of wetlands to provide stopover habitat for over 10,000 American black ducks during fall migration. Also, the Atlantic Coast Joint Venture has been protecting the habitat of the American black duck through habitat restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas. In 2003, a Boreal Forest Conservation Framework was adopted by conservation organizations, industries and First Nations to protect the Canadian boreal forests, including the American black duck&#x27;s eastern Canadian breeding range.

<text>The Anglosphere, also known as the Anglo-American world, is the Anglo-American sphere of influence, with a core group of nations that today maintain close political, diplomatic and military co-operation. While the nations included in different sources vary, the Anglosphere is usually not considered to include all countries where English is an official language, so it is not synonymous with the sphere of anglophones, though commonly included nations are those that were formerly part of the British Empire and retained the English language and English common law.

The five core countries of the Anglosphere are usually taken to be Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries enjoy close cultural and diplomatic links with one another and are aligned under military and security programmes such as Five Eyes. 

== Definitions and variable geometry ==
The Anglosphere is the Anglo-American sphere of influence. The term was first coined by the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson in his book &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, published in 1995. John Lloyd adopted the term in 2000 and defined it as including English-speaking countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, and the British West Indies. James C. Bennett defines &quot;anglosphere&quot; as &quot;the English-speaking Common Law-based nations of the world&quot;, arguing that former British colonies that retained English common law and the English language have done significantly better than counterparts colonised by other European powers. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines the Anglosphere as &quot;the countries of the world in which the English language and cultural values predominate&quot;. However the Anglosphere is usually not considered to include all countries where English is an official language, so it is not synonymous with anglophone.

===Core Anglosphere===
The definition is usually taken to include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States in a grouping of developed countries called the &quot;core Anglosphere&quot;. The term Anglosphere can also more widely encompass Ireland, Malta and the Commonwealth Caribbean countries.

The five core countries in the Anglosphere are developed countries that maintain close cultural and diplomatic links with one another. They are aligned under such military and security programmes as:
*ABCANZ Armies
*Air and Space Interoperability Council (air forces)
*AUKUS, a 2021 trilateral security partnership between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States focused on Australia acquiring nuclear-powered attack submarines
*AUSCANNZUKUS (navies)
*Border Five
*Combined Communications Electronics Board (communications electronics)
*Five Eyes (intelligence)
*Five Nations Passport Group
*Migration 5
*The Technical Cooperation Program (technology and science)
*The UKUSA Agreement (signals intelligence).

Relations have traditionally been warm between Anglosphere countries, with bilateral partnerships such as those between Australia and New Zealand, the United States and Canada and the United States and the United Kingdom (the Special Relationship) constituting the most successful partnerships in the world.

In terms of political systems, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have Charles III as head of state, form part of the Commonwealth of Nations and use the Westminster parliamentary system of government. Most of the core countries have first-past-the-post electoral systems, though Australia and New Zealand have reformed their systems and there are other systems used in some elections in the UK. As a consequence, most core Anglosphere countries have politics dominated by two major parties.

Below is a table comparing the five core countries of the Anglosphere (data for 2022/2023):

== Culture and economics ==
Due to their historic links, the Anglosphere countries share many cultural traits that still persist today. Most countries in the Anglosphere follow the rule of law through common law rather than civil law, and favour democracy with legislative chambers above other political systems. Private property is protected by law or constitution.

Market freedom is high in the five core Anglosphere countries, as all five share the Anglo-Saxon economic model – a capitalist model that emerged in the 1970s based on the Chicago school of economics with origins from the 18th century United Kingdom. The shared sense of globalisation led cities such as New York, London, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Toronto to have considerable impacts on the international markets and the global economy. Global popular culture has been highly influenced by the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Proponents and critics==
Proponents of the Anglosphere concept typically come from the political right (such as Andrew Roberts of the UK Conservative Party), and critics from the centre-left (for example Michael Ignatieff of the Liberal Party of Canada).

===Proponents===
As early as 1897, Albert Venn Dicey proposed an Anglo-Saxon &quot;intercitizenship&quot; during an address to the Fellows of All Souls at Oxford.

The American businessman James C. Bennett, a proponent of the idea that there is something special about the cultural and legal (common law) traditions of English-speaking nations, writes in his 2004 book &quot;The Anglosphere Challenge&quot;:

Bennett argues that there are two challenges confronting his concept of the Anglosphere. The first is finding ways to cope with rapid technological advancement and the second is the geopolitical challenges created by what he assumes will be an increasing gap between anglophone prosperity and economic struggles elsewhere.

British historian Andrew Roberts claims that the Anglosphere has been central in the First World War, Second World War and Cold War. He goes on to contend that anglophone unity is necessary for the defeat of Islamism.

According to a 2003 profile in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, historian Robert Conquest favoured a British withdrawal from the European Union in favour of creating &quot;a much looser association of English-speaking nations, known as the &#x27;Anglosphere.

====CANZUK====

Favourability ratings tend to be overwhelmingly positive between countries within a subset of the core Anglosphere known as CANZUK (consisting of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), whose members form part of the Commonwealth of Nations and retain Charles III as head of state. In the wake of the United Kingdom&#x27;s decision to leave the European Union (Brexit) as a result of a referendum held in 2016, there has been mounting political and popular support for a loose free travel and common market area to be formed among the CANZUK countries.

===Criticisms===
In 2000, Michael Ignatieff wrote in an exchange with Robert Conquest, published by the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;, that the term neglects the evolution of fundamental legal and cultural differences between the US and the UK, and the ways in which UK and European norms drew closer together during Britain&#x27;s membership in the EU through regulatory harmonisation. Of Conquest&#x27;s view of the Anglosphere, Ignatieff writes: &quot;He seems to believe that Britain should either withdraw from Europe or refuse all further measures of cooperation, which would jeopardize Europe&#x27;s real achievements. He wants Britain to throw in its lot with a union of English-speaking peoples, and I believe this to be a romantic illusion&quot;.

In 2016, Nick Cohen wrote in an article titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Eurosceptic fantasy that the &#x27;Anglosphere&#x27; wants Brexit&quot; for &quot;The Spectator&quot;&#x27;s Coffee House blog: Anglosphere&#x27; is just the right&#x27;s PC replacement for what we used to call in blunter times &#x27;the white Commonwealth&#x27;.&quot; He repeated this criticism in another article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2018. Similar criticism was presented by other critics such as Canadian academic Srđan Vučetić.

In 2018, amidst the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, two British professors of public policy Michael Kenny and Nick Pearce published a critical scholarly monograph titled &quot;Shadows of Empire: The Anglosphere in British Politics&quot; (). In one of a series of accompanying opinion pieces, they questioned:

<text>Conrad of Montferrat (Italian: &quot;Corrado del Monferrato&quot;; Piedmontese: &quot;Conrà ëd Monfrà&quot;) (c. 1146 – 28 April 1192) was a nobleman, one of the major participants in the Third Crusade. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; King of Jerusalem (as Conrad I) by virtue of his marriage to Isabella I of Jerusalem from 24 November 1190, but officially elected only in 1192, days before his death. He was also the eighth Marquess of Montferrat from 1191.

==Early life==
Conrad was the second son of Marquess William V of Montferrat, &quot;the Elder&quot;, and his wife Judith of Babenberg. He was a first cousin of Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor, as well as Louis VII of France and Leopold V of Austria.

Conrad was born in Montferrat, which is now a region of Piedmont, in northwest Italy; during the era in which he was born, it was a margraviate of the Kingdom of Italy in the Holy Roman Empire. The exact place and year are unknown. He is first mentioned in a charter in 1160, when serving at the court of his maternal uncle, Conrad, Bishop of Passau, later Archbishop of Salzburg. (He may have been named after him, or after his mother&#x27;s half-brother, Conrad III of Germany.)

A handsome man, with great personal courage and intelligence, he was described in the &quot;Historia brevis occupationis et amissionis Terrae Sanctae&quot; (&quot;A Short History of the Occupation and Loss of the Holy Land&quot;):

(The last sentence refers to his third marriage to Isabella of Jerusalem in 1190, for which see below.)

He was active in diplomacy from his twenties, and became an effective military commander, campaigning alongside other members of his family in the struggles with the Lombard League. He first married an unidentified lady before 1179, but she was dead by the end of 1186, without leaving any surviving issue.

==Byzantine Empire==
In 1179, following the family&#x27;s alliance with Manuel I Comnenos, Conrad led an army against Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s forces, then commanded by the imperial Chancellor, Archbishop Christian of Mainz. He defeated them at Camerino in September, taking the Chancellor hostage. (He had previously been a hostage of the Chancellor.) He left the captive in his brother Boniface&#x27;s care and went to Constantinople to be rewarded by the Emperor, returning to Italy shortly after Manuel&#x27;s death in 1180. Now in his mid-thirties, his personality and good looks made a striking impression at the Byzantine court: Niketas Choniates describes him as &quot;of beautiful appearance, comely in life&#x27;s springtime, exceptional and peerless in manly courage and intelligence, and in the flower of his body&#x27;s strength&quot;.

In the winter of 1186–1187, Isaac II Angelus offered his sister, Theodora, as a bride to Conrad&#x27;s younger brother Boniface, to renew the Byzantine alliance with Montferrat, but Boniface was married. Conrad, recently widowed, had taken the cross, intending to join his father in the Kingdom of Jerusalem; instead, he accepted Isaac&#x27;s offer and returned to Constantinople in the spring of 1187. On his marriage, he was awarded the rank of Caesar. However, almost immediately, he had to help the Emperor defend his throne against a revolt, led by General Alexios Branas. According to Choniates, Conrad inspired the weak Emperor to take the initiative. He fought without a shield or helmet and wore a linen cuirass instead of mail in the battle in which Branas was killed. He was slightly wounded in the shoulder, but unhorsed Branas, who was then killed and beheaded by his bodyguards.

However, feeling that his service had been insufficiently rewarded, wary of Byzantine anti-Latin sentiment (his youngest brother Renier had been murdered in 1182) and of possible vengeance-seeking by Branas&#x27;s family, Conrad set off for the Kingdom of Jerusalem in July 1187 aboard a Genoese merchant vessel. Some popular modern histories have claimed that he was fleeing vengeance after committing a private murder: this is due to a failure to recognise Branas&#x27;s name, garbled into &quot;Lyvernas&quot; in the Old French &quot;Continuation of William of Tyre&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;The Chronicle of Ernoul&quot;), and Roger of Howden&#x27;s abridgement of his own &quot;Gesta regis Henrici Secundi&quot; (formerly attributed to Benedict of Peterborough). Roger had initially referred to Conrad as &quot;having slain a prominent nobleman in a rebellion&quot;—meaning Branas; in his &quot;Chronica&quot;, he condensed this to &quot;having committed homicide&quot;, omitting the context.

==Defense of Tyre==
Conrad evidently intended to join his father, who held the castle of St Elias. He arrived first off Acre, which had recently fallen to Saladin (Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb), and so sailed north to Tyre, where he found the remnants of the Crusader army. After his victory at the Battle of Hattin over the army of Jerusalem, Saladin was on the march north, and had already captured Acre, Sidon, and Beirut. Raymond III of Tripoli and his stepsons, Reginald of Sidon and several other leading nobles who had escaped the battle had fled to Tyre, but most were anxious to return to their own territories to defend them. Raymond of Tripoli was in failing health, and died soon after he went home.

According to the Old French &quot;Continuation of William of Tyre&quot;, Reginald of Sidon had taken charge in Tyre and was in the process of negotiating its surrender with Saladin. Conrad allegedly threw Saladin&#x27;s banners into the ditch and made the Tyrians swear total loyalty to him. His rise to power seems to have been less dramatic in reality. Reginald went to refortify his own castle of Belfort on the Litani River. With the support of the established Italian merchant communities in the city, Conrad re-organised the defence of Tyre, setting up a commune, similar to those he had so often fought against in Italy.

When Saladin&#x27;s army arrived they found the city well-defended and defiant. As the chronicler Ibn al-Athir wrote of the man the Arabs came to respect and fear as &quot;al-Markis&quot;: &quot;He was a devil incarnate in his ability to govern and defend a town, and a man of extraordinary courage&quot;. Tyre successfully withstood the siege, and desiring a more profitable conquest, Saladin&#x27;s army moved on south to Caesarea, Arsuf, and Jaffa. Meanwhile, Conrad sent Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre, to the West in a black-sailed ship, bearing appeals for aid. Arabic writers claimed that he also carried propaganda pictures to use in his preaching, including one of the horses of Saladin&#x27;s army stabled (and urinating) in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and another of a Saracen slapping Christ&#x27;s face.

In November 1187, Saladin returned for a second siege of Tyre. Conrad was still in command of the city, which was now heavily fortified and filled with Christian refugees from across the north of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. This time Saladin opted for a combined ground and naval assault, setting up a blockade of the harbour. In an incident described by the &quot;Itinerarium Peregrinorum&quot; (which is generally hostile to Conrad), the Old French &quot;Continuation&quot; and Sicardus of Cremona&#x27;s second chronicle (now known through quotations by Salimbene di Adam and Alberto Millioli), Saladin presented Conrad&#x27;s aged father, William V of Montferrat, who had been captured at Hattin, before the walls of the city. He offered to release William and bestow great gifts upon Conrad if he surrendered Tyre. The old man told his son to stand firm, even when the Egyptians threatened to kill him. Conrad declared that William had lived a long life already, and aimed at him with a crossbow himself. Saladin allegedly said, &quot;&quot;This man is an unbeliever and very cruel&quot;. But he had succeeded in calling Saladin&#x27;s bluff: the old Marquis William was released, unharmed, at Tortosa in 1188, and returned to his son.

On 30 December, Conrad&#x27;s forces launched a dawn raid on the weary Egyptian sailors, capturing many of their galleys. The remaining Egyptian ships tried to escape to Beirut, but the Tyrian ships gave chase, and the Egyptians were forced to beach their ships and flee. Saladin then launched an assault on the landward walls, thinking that the defenders were still distracted by the sea battle. However, Conrad led his men in a charge out of the gates and broke the enemy: Hugh of Tiberias distinguished himself in the battle. Saladin was forced to pull back yet again, burning his siege engines and ships to prevent them from falling into enemy hands.

==Struggle for the crown==

In the summer of 1188, Saladin released king Guy of Lusignan, the husband of Queen Sibylla, from captivity. A year later, in 1189, Guy, accompanied by his brother Geoffrey, appeared at Tyre and demanded that Conrad hand over the keys to the city to him. Conrad refused this demand and declared that Guy had forfeited his rights to be king of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. He said that he was holding the city until the arrival of the kings from Europe. By this, he was invoking the terms of Baldwin IV&#x27;s will, terms already broken by Guy and Sibylla: in the event of the death of his nephew Baldwin V of Jerusalem it had been Baldwin&#x27;s will that Baldwin V&#x27;s &quot;most rightful heirs&quot;&quot; were to hold the regency until the succession could be settled by Henry II of England, Philip II of France, and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. Conrad would not allow Guy and Sibylla to enter the city but did allow them to camp outside Tyre&#x27;s walls with their retainers.

Conrad was persuaded by his cousin-once-removed, Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia, to join Guy in the Siege of Acre in 1189. The siege lasted for over two years. In the summer of 1190, Conrad travelled north to Antioch to lead another young kinsman, Frederick of Swabia, safely back to Acre with the remnants of his cousin Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s imperial army.

When Queen Sibylla and their daughters died of disease later that year, King Guy no longer had a legal claim to the throne—but refused to step aside. The heiress of Jerusalem was Queen Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister Isabella, who was married to Humphrey IV of Toron, of whom she was fond. However, Conrad had the support of her mother Maria Comnena and stepfather Balian of Ibelin, as well as Reginald of Sidon and other major nobles of Outremer. They obtained an annulment on the grounds that Isabella had been underage at the time of the marriage and had not been able to give consent. Conrad then married Isabella himself, despite rumours of bigamy because of his marriage to Theodora, who was still alive. However, Choniates, who usually expresses strong disapproval of marital/sexual irregularities, makes no mention of this. This may imply that a divorce had been effected from the Byzantine side before 1190, by which time it was obvious that Conrad would not be returning. There were also objections on grounds of canonical incest, since Conrad&#x27;s brother had previously been married to Isabella&#x27;s half-sister, and Church law regarded this kind of affinity as equal to a blood relationship. However, the papal legate Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, gave his approval. Opponents claimed he had been bribed. The marriage, on 24 November 1190, was conducted by Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais—son of Conrad&#x27;s cousin Robert I of Dreux. Conrad was now &quot;de jure&quot; King of Jerusalem. However, he had been wounded in battle only nine days previously and returned with his bride to Tyre to recover. He came back to the siege in spring, making an unsuccessful sea attack against the Tower of Flies at the harbour entrance.

As Guy was a vassal of Richard I, King of England for his lands in Poitou, Richard supported him in this political struggle, while Conrad was supported by his cousin Leopold V of Austria and cousin-once-removed Philip II, King of France. Conrad acted as chief negotiator in the surrender of Acre and raised the kings&#x27; banners in the city. Afterwards, the parties attempted to come to an agreement. Guy was confirmed as king of Jerusalem, and Conrad was made his heir. Conrad would retain the cities of Tyre, Beirut, and Sidon, and his heirs would inherit Jerusalem on Guy&#x27;s death. In July 1191 Conrad&#x27;s kinsman, King Philip, decided to return to France, but before he left he turned over half the treasure plundered from Acre to Conrad, along with all his prominent Muslim hostages. King Richard asked Conrad to hand over the hostages, but Conrad refused as long as he could. After he finally relented (since Richard was now the leader of the Crusade), Richard had all the hostages killed. Conrad did not join Richard on the campaign to the south, preferring to remain with his wife Isabella in Tyre—believing his life to be in danger. It was probably around this time that Conrad&#x27;s father died.

During that winter, Conrad opened direct negotiations with Saladin, suspecting that Richard&#x27;s next move would be to attempt to wrest Tyre from him and restore it to the royal domain for Guy. His primary aim was to be recognised as ruler in the north, while Saladin (who was simultaneously negotiating with Richard for a possible marriage between his brother Al-Adil and Richard&#x27;s widowed sister Joan, Dowager Queen of Sicily) hoped to separate him from the Crusaders. The situation took a farcical turn when Richard&#x27;s envoy, Isabella&#x27;s ex-husband Humphrey of Toron, spotted Conrad&#x27;s envoy, Reginald of Sidon, out hawking with Al-Adil. There seems to have been no conclusive agreement with Conrad, and Joan refused marriage to a Muslim.

==Assassination==
In April 1192, the kingship was put to the vote. To Richard&#x27;s consternation, the barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem unanimously elected Conrad as King. Richard sold Guy the lordship of Cyprus, where he continued to use a king&#x27;s title, to compensate him and to deter him from returning to Poitou, where his family had long had a reputation for rebelliousness. Richard&#x27;s nephew Henry II of Champagne brought the news of the election result to Tyre on 24 April and returned to Acre.

However, Conrad was never crowned. Around late morning or noon on 28 April, Isabella, who was pregnant, was late in returning from the hammam to dine with him and so he went to eat at the house of his kinsman and friend, Philip, Bishop of Beauvais. The bishop had already eaten, so Conrad returned home. On his way, he was attacked by two Assassins, who stabbed him at least twice in the side and back. His guards killed one of his attackers and captured the other. It is not certain how long Conrad survived. Some sources claimed he died at the scene of the attack or in a nearby church, within a very short time. Richard&#x27;s chroniclers claimed that he was taken home, received the last rites, and urged Isabella to give the city over only to Richard or his representative, but that deathbed scene is open to doubt. He was buried in Tyre, in the Church of the Hospitallers. &quot;[T]he Frankish marquis, the ruler of Tyre, and the greatest devil of all the Franks, Conrad of Montferrat—God damn him!—was killed,&quot; wrote Ibn al-Athir. Certainly, the loss of a potentially formidable king was a blow to the kingdom.

The murder remains unsolved. Under torture, the surviving Assassin claimed that Richard was behind the killing, but that is impossible to prove. A less likely suspect was Humphrey IV of Toron, Isabella&#x27;s first husband. Saladin&#x27;s involvement has also been alleged, as Conrad was in the middle of negotiations with him, but this also seems unlikely as Saladin himself apparently had no love for the Hashshashin. In 1970, Patrick A. Williams argued a plausible case for Henry of Champagne&#x27;s guilt, but if so, it is difficult to imagine him taking such a bold step without his uncle Richard&#x27;s approval.

Later, while returning from the crusade in disguise, King Richard was first recognized by Meinhard II of Görz and then imprisoned by Conrad&#x27;s cousin, Leopold V of Austria. Conrad&#x27;s murder was one of the charges against him. Richard requested for the Assassins to vindicate him, and in a letter, allegedly from their leader, Rashid al-Din Sinan, they appeared to do so. The letter claimed that in 1191, Conrad had captured an Assassin ship that had sought refuge in Tyre during a storm. He killed the captain, imprisoned the crew, and stripped the ship of its treasure. When Rashid al-Din Sinan requested for the ship&#x27;s crew and treasure to be returned, he was rebuffed and so a death sentence was issued for Conrad of Montferrat. However, the letter is believed to have been forged. Sinan was already dead, and apart from that letter and the chronicle entries based upon it, there is no other evidence for the Assassins being involved in shipping. The timing of the murder and its consequences (the pregnant Isabella was married off to Henry of Champagne only seven days later, much to the disgust of Muslim commentators) suggest that the chief motive may be sought in Frankish politics.

==Family==
Conrad&#x27;s brother Boniface was the leader of the Fourth Crusade and a notable patron of troubadours, as was their sister Azalaïs, Marchioness of Saluzzo. Their youngest brother Renier was a son-in-law of the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus, and the eldest, William, had been the first husband of Sibylla and father of Baldwin V of Jerusalem. Conrad was also briefly Marquis of Montferrat, following his father&#x27;s death in 1191. In Montferrat, he was succeeded by Boniface, but his own heiress was (probably) born posthumously: a daughter Maria, &#x27;La Marquise&#x27;, who in 1205 became Queen of Jerusalem on Isabella&#x27;s death, but died young in childbirth. Conrad&#x27;s ex-wife, Theodora, was still living in the mid-late 1190s, when she was having the monastery of Dalmatios converted into a convent, possibly for her own residence.

==Role in fiction, film and art==

The Monferrine court was Occitan in its literary culture, and provided patronage to numerous troubadours. Bertran de Born and Peirol mention Conrad in songs composed at the time of the Third Crusade (see external links below). He was seen as a heroic figure, the noble defender of Tyre—the &quot;Marqués valens e pros&quot; (&quot;the valiant and worthy Marquis&quot;) as Peirol called him. In &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; 50: &quot;Heu, voce flebili cogor enarrare&quot;, he is described as &quot;marchio clarissimus, vere palatinus&quot; (&quot;the most famous Marquis, truly a paladin&quot;). However, subsequently, the long-term prejudice of popular English-language writing towards Richard I and his &quot;Lionheart&quot; myth has adversely affected portrayals of Conrad in English-language fiction and film. Because Richard (and his chroniclers) opposed his claim to the throne, he is generally depicted negatively, even when Richard himself is treated with some scepticism. A rare exception to this is the epic poem &quot;Cœur de Lion&quot; (1822), by Eleanor Anne Porden, in which he is depicted as a tragic Byronic hero.

An entirely fictionalised, unambiguously wicked version of Conrad appears in Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Talisman&quot;, misspelt as &#x27;Conrade of Montserrat&#x27; (the novelist apparently misreading &#x27;f&#x27; as a long &#x27;s&#x27; in his sources) and described as a &quot;marmoset&quot; and &quot;popinjay&quot;. He is also a villain in Maurice Hewlett&#x27;s fanciful &quot;The Life and Death of Richard Yea-and-Nay&quot; (1900). He appears briefly, again in a negative light, in Ronald Welch&#x27;s &quot;Knight Crusader&quot; (1954): the description owes much to his portrayal in Cecil B. de Mille&#x27;s &quot;The Crusades&quot;, mentioned below. The nadir of his fictional appearances is in Graham Shelby&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;The Kings of Vain Intent&quot;. In this, he is thoroughly demonised—depicted as a sinister figure, physically resembling a vampire; in a chapter added by the author to the U.S. edition, he beats and rapes Isabella. These works reflect the later Renaissance and Gothic novel cultural/ethnic stereotype of the &#x27;Machiavellian&#x27; Italian: corrupt, scheming, dandified, not averse to poisoning, even (as in Shelby&#x27;s novel) sexually sadistic. In contrast, the Russian-born French novelist Zoé Oldenbourg gives him a more positive but fleeting cameo role— proud, strong, and as handsome as Choniates described him—in her 1946 novel &quot;Argile et Cendres&quot; (&quot;Clay and Ashes&quot;, published in English as &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; in 1948). He is the hero of Luigi Gabotto&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;Corrado di Monferrato&quot;, which covers his whole career. Another sympathetic portrayal is in Alan Gordon&#x27;s mystery novel, &quot;The Widow of Jerusalem&quot; (2003), which investigates his murder.

In film, he has been consistently depicted as a villain, and with scant regard for accuracy. In Cecil B. de Mille&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;The Crusades&quot;, he is played by Joseph Schildkraut as a scheming traitor, plotting King Richard&#x27;s death with Prince John in England at a time when he was actually already defending Tyre. The 1954 film &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot;, loosely based on &quot;The Talisman&quot;, similarly depicts him as a villain, played by Michael Pate. Egyptian director Youssef Chahine&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din&quot; also shows Scott&#x27;s influence in its hostility towards Conrad (played by Mahmoud El-Meliguy) and Philip, while depicting Richard more favourably.

On television, he was played by Michael Peake in the 1962 British television series &quot;Richard the Lionheart&quot;, which derived some of its plotlines loosely from Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Talisman&quot;. In the more faithful 1980–1981 BBC serialisation of &quot;The Talisman&quot;, he was played by Richard Morant.

In painting and drawing, Conrad figures in a small contemporary manuscript sketch of his ship sailing to Tyre in the &quot;Annals of Genoa&quot;, and various illustrations to Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Talisman&quot;. There is an imaginary portrait of him, c. 1843, by François-Édouard Picot for the Salles des Croisades at Versailles: it depicts him as a handsome, rather pensive man in his forties, wearing a coronet and fanciful pseudo-medieval costume. He is shown with dark hair and a beard; it is more likely that, like his father and at least two of his brothers, he was blond.

In the 2007 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, set in 1191 during the height of the Crusades, Conrad&#x27;s father William V of Montferrat is one of nine Templars targets the main character must assassinate. This is based on the real historical death of Conrad, who was murdered by the Order of Assassins.

<text>Matthew Boulton ( ; 3 September 172817 August 1809) was an English businessman, inventor, mechanical engineer, and silversmith. He was a business partner of the Scottish engineer James Watt. In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.

Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu (&quot;gilt bronze&quot;) and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt&#x27;s business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck&#x27;s share of Watt&#x27;s patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt&#x27;s patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt&#x27;s steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.

Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Birmingham-area men prominent in the arts, sciences, and theology. Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley. The Society met each month near the full moon. Members of the Society have been given credit for developing concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.

Boulton founded the Soho Mint, to which he soon adapted steam power. He sought to improve the poor state of Britain&#x27;s coinage, and after several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century. His &quot;cartwheel&quot; pieces were well designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper British penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971. He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809. His image appeared alongside his partner James Watt on the Bank of England&#x27;s Series F £50 note.

== Background ==

Birmingham had long been a centre of the ironworking industry. In the early 18th century the town entered a period of expansion as iron working became easier and cheaper with the transition (beginning in 1709) from charcoal to coke as a means of smelting iron. Scarcity of wood in increasingly deforested England and discoveries of large quantities of coal in Birmingham&#x27;s county of Warwickshire and the adjacent county of Staffordshire speeded the transition. Much of the iron was forged in small foundries near Birmingham, especially in the Black Country, including nearby towns such as Smethwick and West Bromwich. The resultant thin iron sheets were transported to factories in and around Birmingham. With the town far from the sea and great rivers, and with canals not yet built, metalworkers concentrated on producing small, relatively valuable pieces, especially buttons and buckles. Frenchman Alexander wrote that while he had seen excellent cane heads, snuff boxes and other metal objects in Milan, &quot;the same can be had cheaper and better in Birmingham&quot;. These small objects came to be known as &quot;toys&quot;, and their manufacturers as &quot;toymakers&quot;.

Boulton was a descendant of families from around Lichfield, his great-great-great-great-grandfather, Rev. Zachary Babington, having been Chancellor of Lichfield. Boulton&#x27;s father, also named Matthew and born in 1700, moved to Birmingham from Lichfield to serve an apprenticeship, and in 1723 he married Christiana Piers. The elder Boulton was a toymaker with a small workshop specialising in buckles. Matthew Boulton was born in 1728, their third child and the second of that name, the first Matthew having died at the age of two in 1726.

== Early and family life ==
The elder Boulton&#x27;s business prospered after young Matthew&#x27;s birth, and the family moved to the Snow Hill area of Birmingham, then a well-to-do neighbourhood of new houses. As the local grammar school was in disrepair Boulton was sent to an academy in Deritend, on the other side of Birmingham. At the age of 15 he left school, and by 17 he had invented a technique for inlaying enamels in buckles that proved so popular that the buckles were exported to France, then reimported to Britain and billed as the latest French developments.

On 3 March 1749 Boulton married Mary Robinson, a distant cousin and the daughter of a successful mercer, and wealthy in her own right. They lived briefly with the bride&#x27;s mother in Lichfield, and then moved to Birmingham, where the elder Matthew Boulton made his son a partner at the age of 21. Though the son signed business letters &quot;from father and self&quot;, by the mid-1750s he was effectively running the business. The elder Boulton retired in 1757 and died in 1759.

The Boultons had three daughters in the early 1750s, but all died in infancy. Mary Boulton&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she died in August 1759. Not long after her death Boulton began to woo her sister Anne. Marriage with a deceased wife&#x27;s sister was forbidden by ecclesiastical law, though permitted by common law. Nonetheless, they married on 25 June 1760 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Rotherhithe. Eric Delieb, who wrote a book on Boulton&#x27;s silver, with a biographical sketch, suggests that the marriage celebrant, Rev. James Penfold, an impoverished curate, was probably bribed. Boulton later advised another man who was seeking to wed his late wife&#x27;s sister: &quot;I advise you to say nothing of your intentions but to go quickly and snugly to Scotland or some obscure corner of London, suppose Wapping, and there take lodgings to make yourself a parishioner. When the month is expired and the Law fulfilled, live and be happy ... I recommend silence, secrecy, and Scotland.&quot;

The union was opposed by Anne&#x27;s brother Luke, who feared Boulton would control (and possibly dissipate) much of the Robinson family fortune. In 1764 Luke Robinson died, and his estate passed to his sister Anne and thus into Matthew Boulton&#x27;s control.

The Boultons had two children, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had six children with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly educated and also a man of science, gained some fame posthumously for his invention of the important aeronautical flight control, the aileron. As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children.

=== Expansion of the business ===
After the death of his father in 1759, Boulton took full control of the family toymaking business. He spent much of his time in London and elsewhere, promoting his wares. He arranged for a friend to present a sword to Prince Edward, and the gift so interested the Prince&#x27;s older brother, George, Prince of Wales, the future King George III, that he ordered one for himself.
With capital accumulated from his two marriages and his inheritance from his father, Boulton sought a larger site to expand his business. In 1761 he leased at Soho, then just in Staffordshire, with a residence, Soho House, and a rolling mill. Soho House was at first occupied by Boulton relatives, and then by his first partner, John Fothergill. In 1766 Boulton required Fothergill to vacate Soho House, and lived there himself with his family. Both husband and wife died there, Anne Boulton of an apparent stroke in 1783 and her husband after a long illness in 1809.

The at Soho included common land that Boulton enclosed, later decrying what he saw as the &quot;idle beggarly&quot; condition of the people who had used it. By 1765 his Soho Manufactory had been erected. The warehouse, or &quot;principal building&quot;, had a Palladian front and 19 bays for loading and unloading, and had quarters for clerks and managers on the upper storeys. The structure was designed by local architect William Wyatt at a time when industrial buildings were commonly designed by engineers. Other buildings contained workshops. Boulton and Fothergill invested in the most advanced metalworking equipment, and the complex was admired as a modern industrial marvel. Although the cost of the principal building alone had been estimated at £2,000 (about £276,000 today); the final cost was five times that amount. The partnership spent over £20,000 in building and equipping the premises. The partners&#x27; means were not equal to the total costs, which were met only by heavy borrowing and by artful management of creditors.

Among the products Boulton sought to make in his new facility were sterling silver plate for those able to afford it, and old Sheffield plate, silver sheet fused with copper sheet, for those less well off. Boulton and his father had long made small silver items, but there is no record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton did so. To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm made many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which were shaped and joined together. Towards the end of the 18th century, Boulton and his followers expanded production at the Soho Manufactory to include shoe buckles and seals, marking Birmingham&#x27;s rise as a centre for both silver plate and mass-produced metal goods. One impediment to Boulton&#x27;s work was the lack of an assay office in Birmingham. The silver toys long made by the family firm were generally too light to require assaying, but heavier items had to be sent over to the nearest assay office, at Chester, to be assayed and hallmarked, with the attendant risks of damage and loss. Alternatively they could be sent to London, but this exposed them to the risk of being copied by competitors. Boulton wrote in 1771, &quot;I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith, yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended, unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [assay office] at Birmingham.&quot; Boulton petitioned Parliament for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham. Though the petition was bitterly opposed by London goldsmiths, he was successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices in Birmingham and Sheffield, whose silversmiths had faced similar difficulties in transporting their wares. The silver business proved not to be profitable due to the opportunity cost of keeping a large amount of capital tied up in the inventory of silver. The firm continued to make large quantities of Sheffield plate, but Boulton delegated responsibility for this enterprise to trusted subordinates, involving himself little in it.

As part of Boulton&#x27;s efforts to market to the wealthy, he started to sell vases decorated with ormolu, previously a French speciality. Ormolu was milled gold (from the French &quot;or moulu&quot;) amalgamated with mercury, and applied to the item, which was then heated to drive off the mercury, leaving the gold decoration. In the late 1760s and early 1770s there was a fashion among the wealthy for decorated vases, and he sought to cater to this craze. He initially ordered ceramic vases from his friend and fellow Lunar Society member Josiah Wedgwood, but ceramic proved unable to bear the weight of the decorations and Boulton chose marble and other decorative stone as the material for his vases. Boulton copied vase designs from classical Greek works and borrowed works of art from collectors, merchants, and sculptors. 

Fothergill and others searched Europe for designs for these creations. In March 1770 Boulton visited the Royal Family and sold several vases to Queen Charlotte, George III&#x27;s wife. He ran annual sales at Christie&#x27;s in 1771 and 1772. The Christie&#x27;s exhibition succeeded in publicising Boulton and his products, which were highly praised, but the sales were not financially successful with many works left unsold or sold below cost. When the craze for vases ended in the early 1770s, the partnership was left with a large stock on its hands, and disposed of much of it in a single massive sale to Catherine the Great of Russia—the Empress described the vases as superior to French ormolu, and cheaper as well. Boulton continued to solicit orders, though &quot;ormolu&quot; was dropped from the firm&#x27;s business description from 1779, and when the Boulton-Fothergill partnership was dissolved by the latter&#x27;s 1782 death there were only 14 items of ormolu in the &quot;toy room&quot;.

Among Boulton&#x27;s most successful products were mounts for small Wedgwood products such as plaques, cameo brooches and buttons in the distinctive ceramics, notably jasper ware, for which Wedgwood&#x27;s firm remains well known. The mounts of these articles, many of which have survived, were made of ormolu or cut steel, which had a jewel-like gleam. Boulton and Wedgwood were friends, alternately co-operating and competing, and Wedgwood wrote of Boulton, &quot;It doubles my courage to have the first Manufacturer in England to encounter with—The match likes me well—I like the Man, I like his spirit.&quot;

In the 1770s Boulton introduced an insurance system for his workers that served as the model for later schemes, allowing his workers compensation in the event of injury or illness. The first of its kind in any large establishment, employees paid one-sixtieth of their wages into the Soho Friendly Society, membership in which was mandatory. The firm&#x27;s apprentices were poor or orphaned boys, trainable into skilled workmen; he declined to hire the sons of gentlemen as apprentices, stating that they would be &quot;out of place&quot; among the poorer boys.

Not all of Boulton&#x27;s innovations proved successful. Together with painter Francis Eginton, he created a process for the mechanical reproduction of paintings for middle-class homes, but eventually abandoned the procedure. Boulton and James Keir produced an alloy called &quot;Eldorado metal&quot; that they claimed would not corrode in water and could be used for sheathing wooden ships. After sea trials the Admiralty rejected their claims, and the metal was used for fanlights and sash windows at Soho House. Boulton feared that construction of a nearby canal would damage his water supply, but this did not prove to be the case, and in 1779 he wrote, &quot;Our navigation goes on prosperously; the junction with the Wolverhampton Canal is complete, and we already sail to Bristol and to Hull.&quot;

=== Partnership with Watt ===

Boulton&#x27;s Soho site proved to have insufficient hydropower for his needs, especially in the summer when the millstream&#x27;s flow was greatly reduced. He realised that using a steam engine either to pump water back up to the millpond or to drive equipment directly would help to provide the necessary power. He began to correspond with Watt in 1766, and first met him two years later. In 1769 Watt patented an engine with the innovation of a separate condenser, making it far more efficient than earlier engines. Boulton realised not only that this engine could power his manufactory, but also that its production might be a profitable business venture.

After receiving the patent, Watt did little to develop the engine into a marketable invention, turning to other work. In 1772, Watt&#x27;s partner, Dr. John Roebuck, ran into financial difficulties, and Boulton, to whom he owed £1,200, accepted his two-thirds share in Watt&#x27;s patent as satisfaction of the debt. Boulton&#x27;s partner Fothergill refused to have any part in the speculation, and accepted cash for his share. Boulton&#x27;s share was worth little without Watt&#x27;s efforts to improve his invention. At the time, the principal use of steam engines was to pump water out of mines. The engine commonly in use was the Newcomen steam engine, which consumed large amounts of coal and, as mines became deeper, proved incapable of keeping them clear of water. Watt&#x27;s work was well known, and a number of mines that needed engines put off purchasing them in the hope that Watt would soon market his invention.

Boulton boasted about Watt&#x27;s talents, leading to an employment offer from the Russian government, which Boulton had to persuade Watt to turn down. In 1774 he was able to convince Watt to move to Birmingham, and they entered into a partnership the following year. By 1775 six of the 14 years of Watt&#x27;s original patent had elapsed, but thanks to Boulton&#x27;s lobbying Parliament passed an act extending Watt&#x27;s patent until 1800. Boulton and Watt began work improving the engine. With the assistance of iron master John Wilkinson (brother-in-law of Lunar Society member Joseph Priestley), they succeeded in making the engine commercially viable.

In 1776 the partnership erected two engines, one for Wilkinson and one at a mine in Tipton in the Black Country. Both engines were successfully installed, leading to favourable publicity for the partnership. Boulton and Watt began to install engines elsewhere. The firm rarely produced the engine itself: it had the purchaser buy parts from a number of suppliers and then assembled the engine on-site under the supervision of a Soho engineer. The company made its profit by comparing the amount of coal used by the machine with that used by an earlier, less efficient Newcomen engine, and required payments of one-third of the savings annually for the next 25 years. This pricing scheme led to disputes, as many mines fuelled the engines using coal of unmarketable quality that cost the mine owners only the expense of extraction. Mine owners were also reluctant to make the annual payments, viewing the engines as theirs once erected, and threatened to petition Parliament to repeal Watt&#x27;s patent.

The county of Cornwall was a major market for the firm&#x27;s engines. It was mineral-rich and had many mines. However, the special problems for mining there, including local rivalries and high prices for coal, which had to be imported from Wales, forced Watt and later Boulton to spend several months a year in Cornwall overseeing installations and resolving problems with the mineowners. In 1779 the firm hired engineer William Murdoch, who was able to take over the management of most of the on-site installation problems, allowing Watt and Boulton to remain in Birmingham.

The pumping engine for use in mines was a great success. In 1782 the firm sought to modify Watt&#x27;s invention so that the engine had a rotary motion, making it suitable for use in mills and factories. On a 1781 visit to Wales Boulton had seen a powerful copper-rolling mill driven by water, and when told it was often inoperable in the summer due to drought suggested that a steam engine would remedy that defect. Boulton wrote to Watt urging the modification of the engine, warning that they were reaching the limits of the pumping engine market: &quot;There is no other Cornwall to be found, and the most likely line for increasing the consumption of our engines is the application of them to mills, which is certainly an extensive field.&quot; Watt spent much of 1782 on the modification project, and though he was concerned that few orders would result, completed it at the end of the year. One order was received in 1782, and several others from mills and breweries soon after. George III toured the Whitbread brewery in London, and was impressed by the engine there (now preserved at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia). As a demonstration, Boulton used two engines to grind wheat at the rate of 150 bushels per hour in his new Albion Mill in London. While the mill was not financially successful, according to historian Jenny Uglow it served as a &quot;publicity stunt &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot; for the firm&#x27;s latest innovation. Before its 1791 destruction by fire, the mill&#x27;s fame, according to early historian Samuel Smiles, &quot;spread far and wide&quot;, and orders for rotative engines poured in not only from Britain but from the United States and the West Indies.

Between 1775 and 1800 the firm produced approximately 450 engines. It did not let other manufacturers produce engines with separate condensers, and approximately 1,000 Newcomen engines, less efficient but cheaper and not subject to the restrictions of Watt&#x27;s patent, were produced in Britain during that time. Boulton boasted to James Boswell when the diarist toured Soho, &quot;I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER.&quot; The development of an efficient steam engine allowed large-scale industry to be developed, and the industrial city, such as Manchester became, to exist.

=== Involvement with coinage ===
By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. Few of the silver coins being passed were genuine. Even the copper coins were melted down and replaced with lightweight fakes. The Royal Mint struck no copper coins for 48 years, from 1773 until 1821. The resultant gap was filled with copper tokens that approximated the size of the halfpenny, struck on behalf of merchants. Boulton struck millions of these merchant pieces. On the rare occasions when the Royal Mint did strike coins, they were relatively crude, with quality control nonexistent.

Boulton had turned his attention to coinage in the mid-1780s; they were just another small metal product like those he manufactured. He also had shares in several Cornish copper mines, and had a large personal stock of copper, purchased when the mines were unable to dispose of it elsewhere. However, when orders for counterfeit money were sent to him, he refused them: &quot;I will do anything, short of being a common informer against particular persons, to stop the malpractices of the Birmingham coiners.&quot; In 1788 he established the Soho Mint as part of his industrial plant. The mint included eight steam-driven presses, each striking between 70 and 84 coins per minute. The firm had little immediate success getting a licence to strike British coins, but was soon engaged in striking coins for the British East India Company for use in India.

The coin crisis in Britain continued. In a letter to the Master of the Mint, Lord Hawkesbury (whose son would become Prime Minister as Earl of Liverpool) on 14 April 1789, Boulton wrote:
In the course of my journeys, I observe that I receive upon an average two-thirds counterfeit halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. and I believe the evil is daily increasing, as the spurious money is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers, who pay with it the principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ. They purchase from the subterraneous coiners 36 shillings&#x27;-worth of copper (in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.
Boulton offered to strike new coins at a cost &quot;not exceeding half the expense which the common copper coin hath always cost at his Majesty&#x27;s Mint&quot;. He wrote to his friend, Sir Joseph Banks, describing the advantages of his coinage presses:
It will coin much faster, with greater ease, with fewer persons, for less expense, and more beautiful than any other machinery ever used for coining ... Can lay the pieces or blanks upon the die quite true and without care or practice and as fast as wanted. Can work night and day without fatigue by two setts of boys. The machine keeps an account of the number of pieces struck which cannot be altered from the truth by any of the persons employed. The apparatus strikes an inscription upon the edge with the same blow that strikes the two faces. It strikes the [back]ground of the pieces brighter than any other coining press can do. It strikes the pieces perfectly round, all of equal diameter, and exactly concentric with the edge, which cannot be done by any other machinery now in use.
Boulton spent much time in London lobbying for a contract to strike British coins, but in June 1790 the Pitt Government postponed a decision on recoinage indefinitely. Meanwhile, the Soho Mint struck coins for the East India Company, Sierra Leone and Russia, while producing high-quality planchets, or blank coins, to be struck by national mints elsewhere. The firm sent over 20 million blanks to Philadelphia, to be struck into cents and half-cents by the United States Mint—Mint Director Elias Boudinot found them to be &quot;perfect and beautifully polished&quot;. The high-technology Soho Mint gained increasing and somewhat unwelcome attention: rivals attempted industrial espionage, while lobbying for Boulton&#x27;s mint to be shut down.

The national financial crisis reached its nadir in February 1797, when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold. In an effort to get more money into circulation, the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins, and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797, informing him of the Government&#x27;s plan. Four days later, Boulton attended a meeting of the Privy Council, and was awarded a contract at the end of the month. According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797, King George III was &quot;graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency ... which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies&quot;. The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively, bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value. Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers, features difficult for counterfeiters to match. The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet. The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits. Küchler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings; these were not authorised by the proclamation, and though pattern pieces were struck, they never officially entered circulation. The halfpenny measured ten to a foot, the farthing 12 to a foot. The coins were nicknamed &quot;cartwheels&quot;, both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations. The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper. The new coins were issued at the Soho Mint and by Charlotte Matthews who was the banker and business advisor to Watt and Boulton.

The cartwheel twopenny coin was not struck again; much of the mintage was melted down in 1800 when the price of copper increased and it had proved too heavy for commerce and was difficult to strike. Much to Boulton&#x27;s chagrin, the new coins were being counterfeited in copper-covered lead within a month of issuance. Boulton was awarded additional contracts in 1799 and 1806, each for the lower three copper denominations. Though the cartwheel design was used again for the 1799 penny (struck with the date 1797), all other strikings used lighter planchets to reflect the rise in the price of copper, and featured more conventional designs. Boulton greatly reduced the counterfeiting problem by adding lines to the coin edges, and striking slightly concave planchets. Counterfeiters turned their sights to easier targets, the pre-Soho pieces, which were not withdrawn, due to the expense, until a gradual withdrawal took place between 1814 and 1817.

Watt, in his eulogy after Boulton&#x27;s death in 1809, stated:
In short, had Mr. Boulton done nothing more in the world than he has accomplished in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this was done in the midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,—for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.
== Activities and views ==
=== Scientific studies and the Lunar Society ===

Boulton never had any formal schooling in science. His associate and fellow Lunar Society member James Keir eulogised him after his death:
Mr. [Boulton] is proof of how much scientific knowledge may be acquired without much regular study, by means of a quick &amp; just apprehension, much practical application, and nice mechanical feelings. He had very correct notions of the several branches of natural philosophy, was master of every metallic art &amp; possessed all the chemistry that had any relations to the object of his various manufactures. Electricity and astronomy were at one time among his favourite amusements.


From an early age, Boulton had interested himself in the scientific advances of his times. He discarded theories that electricity was a manifestation of the human soul, writing &quot;we know tis matter &amp; tis wrong to call it Spirit&quot;. He called such theories &quot;Cymeras [chimeras] of each others Brain&quot;. His interest brought him into contact with other enthusiasts such as John Whitehurst, who also became a member of the Lunar Society. In 1758 the Pennsylvania printer Benjamin Franklin, the leading experimenter in electricity, journeyed to Birmingham during one of his lengthy stays in Britain; Boulton met him, and introduced him to his friends. Boulton worked with Franklin in efforts to contain electricity within a Leyden jar, and when the printer needed new glass for his &quot;glassychord&quot; (a mechanised version of musical glasses) he obtained it from Boulton.

Despite time constraints imposed on him by the expansion of his business, Boulton continued his &quot;philosophical&quot; work (as scientific experimentation was then called). He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people&#x27;s pulse rates at different ages, on the movements of the planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who became a member of the Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, &quot;As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble you to do me a favour in the ... philosophical way.&quot;

The Birmingham enthusiasts, including Boulton, Whitehurst, Keir, Darwin, Watt (after his move to Birmingham), potter Josiah Wedgwood and clergyman and chemist Joseph Priestley began to meet informally in the late 1750s. This evolved into a monthly meeting near the full moon, providing light to journey home afterwards, a pattern common for clubs in Britain at the time. The group eventually dubbed itself the &quot;Lunar Society&quot;, and following the death of member Dr William Small in 1775, who had informally co-ordinated communication between the members, Boulton took steps to put the Society on a formal footing. They met on Sundays, beginning with dinner at 2 pm, and continuing with discussions until at least 8.

While not a formal member of the Lunar Society, Sir Joseph Banks was active in it. In 1768 Banks sailed with Captain James Cook to the South Pacific, and took with him green glass earrings made at Soho to give to the natives. In 1776 Captain Cook ordered an instrument from Boulton, most likely for use in navigation. Boulton generally preferred not to take on lengthy projects, and he warned Cook that its completion might take years. In June 1776 Cook left on the voyage on which he was killed almost three years later, and Boulton&#x27;s records show no further mention of the instrument.

In addition to the scientific discussions and experiments conducted by the group, Boulton had a business relationship with some of the members. Watt and Boulton were partners for a quarter century. Boulton purchased vases from Wedgwood&#x27;s pottery to be decorated with ormolu, and contemplated a partnership with him. Keir was a long-time supplier and associate of Boulton, though Keir never became his partner as he hoped.

In 1785 both Boulton and Watt were elected as Fellows of the Royal Society. According to Whitehurst, who wrote to congratulate Boulton, not a single vote was cast against him.

Though Boulton hoped his activities for the Lunar Society would &quot;prevent the decline of a Society which I hope will be lasting&quot;, as members died or moved away they were not replaced. In 1813, four years after his death, the Society was dissolved and a lottery was held to dispose of its assets. Since there were no minutes of meetings, few details of the gatherings remain. Historian Jenny Uglow wrote of the lasting impact of the Society:
The Lunar Society[&#x27;s] ... members have been called the fathers of the Industrial Revolution ... [T]he importance of this particular Society stems from its pioneering work in experimental chemistry, physics, engineering, and medicine, combined with leadership in manufacturing and commerce, and with political and social ideals. Its members were brilliant representatives of the informal scientific web which cut across class, blending the inherited skills of craftsmen with the theoretical advances of scholars, a key factor in Britain&#x27;s leap ahead of the rest of Europe.
=== Community work ===
Boulton was widely involved in civic activities in Birmingham. His friend Dr John Ash had long sought to build a hospital in the town. A great fan of the music of Handel, Boulton conceived of the idea to hold a music festival in Birmingham to raise funds for the hospital. The festival took place in September 1768, the first of a series that lasted until 1912. The hospital, Birmingham General, opened in 1779. Boulton also helped build the General Dispensary, where outpatient treatment could be obtained. A firm supporter of the Dispensary, he served as treasurer, and wrote, &quot;If the funds of the institution are not sufficient for its support, I will make up the deficiency.&quot; The Dispensary soon outgrew its original quarters, and a new building in Temple Row was opened in 1808, shortly before Boulton&#x27;s death.

Boulton helped found the New Street Theatre in 1774, and later wrote that having a theatre encouraged well-to-do visitors to come to Birmingham, and to spend more money than they would have otherwise. Boulton attempted to have the theatre recognised as a patent theatre with a Royal Patent, entitled to present serious drama; he failed in 1779 but succeeded in 1807. He also supported Birmingham&#x27;s Oratorio Choral Society, and collaborated with button maker and amateur musical promoter Joseph Moore to put on a series of private concerts in 1799. He maintained a pew at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Birmingham, a centre of musical excellence. When performances of the &quot;Messiah&quot; were organised at Westminster Abbey in 1784 in the (incorrect) belief it was the centennial of Handel&#x27;s birth and the (correct) belief that it was the 25th anniversary of his death, Boulton attended and wrote, &quot;I scarcely know which was grandest, the sounds or the scene. Both was transcendibly fine that it is not in my power of words to describe. In the grand Halleluja my soul almost ascended from my body.&quot;

Concerned about the level of crime in Birmingham, Boulton complained, &quot;The streets are infested from Noon Day to midnight with prostitutes.&quot; In an era prior to the establishment of the police, Boulton served on a committee to organise volunteers to patrol the streets at night and reduce crime. He supported the local militia, providing money for weapons. In 1794 he was elected High Sheriff of Staffordshire, his county of residence.

Besides seeking to improve local life, Boulton took an interest in world affairs. Initially sympathetic to the cause of the rebellious American colonists, Boulton changed his view once he realised that an independent America might be damaging towards British trade, and in 1775 organised a petition urging the government to adopt a firmer stance with the Americans—though when the revolution proved successful, he resumed trade with the former colonies. He was more sympathetic to the cause of the French Revolution, believing it justified, though he expressed his horror at the bloody excesses of the Revolutionary government. When war with France broke out, he paid for weapons for a company of volunteers, sworn to resist any French invasion.

== Family and later life, death, and memorials ==
When Boulton was widowed in 1783 he was left with the care of his two teenage children. Neither his son Matthew Robinson Boulton nor his daughter Anne enjoyed robust health; the younger Matthew was often ill and was a poor student who was shuttled from school to school until he joined his father&#x27;s business in 1790; Anne suffered from a diseased leg that prevented her from enjoying a full life. Despite his lengthy absences on business, Boulton cared deeply for his family. He wrote to his wife in January 1780,
Nothing could in the least palliate this long, this cold, this very distant separation from my dearest wife and children but the certain knowledge that I am preparing for their ease, happiness and prosperity, and when that is the prise, I know no hardships that I would not encounter with, to obtain it.
With the expiry of the patent in 1800 both Boulton and Watt retired from the partnership, each turning over his role to his namesake son. The two sons made changes, quickly ending public tours of the Soho Manufactory in which the elder Boulton had taken pride throughout his time in Soho. In retirement Boulton remained active, continuing to run the Soho Mint. When a new Royal Mint was built on Tower Hill in 1805, Boulton was awarded the contract to equip it with modern machinery. His continued activity distressed Watt, who had entirely retired from Soho, and who wrote to Boulton in 1804, &quot;[Y]our friends fear much that your necessary attention to the operation of the coinage may injure your health&quot;.

Boulton helped deal with the shortage of silver, persuading the Government to let him overstrike the Bank of England&#x27;s large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, in part due to counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, &quot;The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass.&quot; Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high-quality fakes arrived at the bank&#x27;s offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton&#x27;s were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery, which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost ninety million pieces for the East India Company. He wrote, &quot;Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon, there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining.&quot;

By early 1809 he was seriously ill. He had long suffered from kidney stones, which also lodged in the bladder, causing him great pain. He died at Soho House on 17 August 1809. He was buried in the graveyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, in Birmingham—the church was later extended over the site of his grave. Inside the church, on the north wall of the sanctuary, is a large marble monument to him, commissioned by his son, sculpted by the sculptor John Flaxman. It includes a marble bust of Boulton, set in a circular opening above two putti, one holding an engraving of the Soho Manufactory.
Boulton is recognised by several memorials and other commemorations in and around Birmingham. Soho House, his home from 1766 until his death, is now a museum, as is his first workshop, Sarehole Mill. Matthew Boulton&#x27;s family papers, along with the records of James Watt and family and the firm of Boulton and Watt collectively form the Archives of Soho and are held at Birmingham Archives and Collections, at the Library of Birmingham. He is recognised by blue plaques at his Steelhouse Lane birthplace and at Soho House. A gilded bronze statue of &quot;Boulton, Watt and Murdoch&quot; (1956) by William Bloye stands opposite Centenary Square in central Birmingham. Matthew Boulton College was named in his honour in 1957. The two-hundredth anniversary of his death, in 2009, resulted in a number of tributes. Birmingham City Council promoted &quot;a year-long festival celebrating the life, work and legacy of Matthew Boulton&quot;.

On 29 May 2009 the Bank of England announced that Boulton and Watt would appear on a new £50 note. The design is the first to feature a dual portrait on a Bank of England note, and presents the two industrialists side by side with images of a steam engine and Boulton&#x27;s Soho Manufactory. Quotes attributed to each of the men are inscribed on the note: &quot;I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—POWER&quot; (Boulton) and &quot;I can think of nothing else but this machine&quot; (Watt). The notes entered circulation on 2 November 2011.

In March 2009, Boulton was honoured with the issue of a Royal Mail postage stamp. On 17 October 2014 a bronze memorial plaque to Boulton was unveiled in the Chapel of St Paul, Westminster Abbey, beside the plaque to his business partner James Watt.

<doc id="250766" wikidata="Q1127126" url="?curid=250766" title="Military alliance">
<text>A military alliance is a formal agreement between nations that specifies mutual obligations regarding national security. In the event a nation is attacked, members of the alliance are often obligated to come to their defense regardless if attacked directly. Military alliances can be classified into defense pacts, non-aggression pacts, and ententes. Alliances may be covert (as was common from 1870 to 1916) or public. 

According to a 2002 dataset of military alliances, there have been 538 alliance treaties from 1815 to 2003. The vast majority of the alliances involve commitments to come to the military support of one ally involved in war. The vast majority are defensive in nature. Since the end of the Second World War, military alliances have usually behaved less aggressively and act more as a deterrent.

== Characteristics ==
Military alliances are related to collective security systems but can differ in nature. An early 1950s memorandum from the United States Department of State explained the difference by noting that historically, alliances &quot;were designed to advance the respective nationalistic interests of the parties, and provided for joint military action if one of the parties in pursuit of such objectives became involved in war.&quot; A collective security arrangement &quot;is directed against no one; it is directed solely against aggression. It seeks not to influence any shifting &#x27;balance of power&#x27; but to strengthen the &#x27;balance of principle&#x27;.&quot;

The obvious motivation in states engaging in military alliances is to protect themselves against threats from other countries. However, states have also entered into alliances to improve ties with a particular nation or to manage conflict with a particular nation.

The nature of alliances, including their formation and cohesiveness (or lack thereof), is a subject of much academic study past and present. Influential works include those by Glenn Snyder, Stephen Walt, and Kenneth Waltz. Kenneth Waltz outlined in his 1979 book &quot;Theory of International Politics&quot; a neorealist theory of international politics where he argued that balances of power tend to form in world politics. Alongside neoliberalism, neorealism is one of the two most influential contemporary approaches to the study of military alliances in international relations; the two perspectives dominated international relations theory from the 1960s to the 1990s. Neorealism emerged from the North American discipline of political science, and reformulates the understanding of military alliances in the classical realist tradition of E. H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, George Kennan and Reinhold Niebuhr. Neorealism is subdivided into defensive and offensive neorealism. 

During peace-time, according to a 2019 study, almost all alliances from 1870 to 1916 may have been covert or implied. In other time periods, covert alliances have been rare. The study argues that from 1870 to 1916, the unusual amount of covert alliances was incentivized by other covert alliances. The creation of public alliances would signal to the covert ally that the public alliance was more valuable. According to Ronald Krebs, pre-WWII alliances were generally &quot;relatively simple, short-lived affairs.&quot;

Common problems for alliances revolve around free-riding and burden-sharing. Members of an alliance have incentives not to contribute to the alliance while simultaneously benefiting on the public goods provided by the alliance. According to Mancur Olson and Richard Zeckhauser&#x27;s classic study of alliances, small states frequently free-ride on the large state&#x27;s contributions to an alliance. Small allies that are militarily vulnerable are less likely to free-ride, whereas strategically important small allies are most likely to free-ride. Alliances may also lead to moral hazard whereby allies behave more aggressively and recklessly if they believe that the alliance will aid them in any conflict. On the whole, alliances do deter aggression on net.

Within alliances, actors may fear entrapment or abandonment. Entrapment means that allies get dragged into a conflict over one ally&#x27;s interests that the other allies do not share. Scholars have disputed the prevalence of entrapment, with Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth writing &quot;it is nearly impossible to find a clear case of entrapment actually occurring.&quot; Abandonment means that allies do not come to the rescue of a fellow ally. Strong commitments to an alliance can reduce the bargaining power of that ally vis-a-vis the other allies. However, an ally whose commitment to the alliance is in doubt has greater bargaining leverage. Weak alliance commitments can make it easier for the ally to realign the alliance if a fellow ally is considered unsatisfactory. Strong alliance commitments may strengthen the adversary&#x27;s alliance, as the adversary may face a greater threat.

The failure of a strong ally to come to the rescue of a weaker ally (abandonment) may jeopardize the strong ally&#x27;s other alliances. However, it may also strengthen the other alliances, as the other allies may sometimes prefer that the strong ally abandons a weak ally if it is likely to raise the risks of military escalation for the other allies.

== European historiography ==

In the European historical context, a military alliance can be viewed as a league between independent states, defined by treaty, for the purpose of combined action, defensive or offensive, or both. The oldest such alliance in the world today is the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, dating back to 1373 where the then Kingdoms of England and Portugal pledged to &quot;perpetual friendship&quot; between the two countries. This remains in action today between the current United Kingdom and Portugal, and the two have never fought against each other in any military campaign. Alliances have often been directed to specific objects carefully defined in the treaties. Thus the Triple Alliance of 1668 between Great Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands, and the Grand Alliance of 1689 between the Holy Roman Empire, Holland, England, Spain and Saxony, were both directed against the power of Louis XIV of France. The Quadruple or Grand Alliance of 1814, defined in the Treaty of Chaumont, between Great Britain, Austria, Russia and Prussia, had for its object the overthrow of Napoleon and his dynasty, and the confining of France within her traditional boundaries. The Triple Alliance of 1882 between Germany, Austria and Italy was ostensibly directed to the preservation of European peace against any possible aggressive action of France or Russia; and this led in turn, some ten years later, to the Dual Alliance between Russia and France, for mutual support in case of any hostile action of the other powers.

Occasionally, however, attempts have been made to give alliances a more general character. Thus the Holy Alliance of 26 September 1815 was an attempt, inspired by the religious idealism of the Emperor Alexander I of Russia, to find in the &quot;sacred precepts of the Gospel&quot;, a common basis for a general league of the European governments, its object being, primarily, the preservation of peace. So, too, by Article VI of the Quadruple Treaty signed at Paris on 20 November 1815 – which renewed that of Chaumont and was again renewed, in 1818, at Aix-la-Chapelle – the scope of the Grand Alliance was extended to objects of common interest not specifically stated in the treaties. The article runs: &quot;In order to consolidate the intimate tie which unites the four sovereigns for the happiness of the world, the High Contracting Powers have agreed to renew at fixed intervals, either under their own auspices or by their respective ministers, meetings consecrated to great common objects and to the examination of such measures as at each one of these epochs shall be judged most salutary for the peace and prosperity of the nations and the maintenance of the tranquility of Europe&quot;.

It was this article of the treaty of the 20 November 1815, rather than the Holy Alliance, that formed the basis of the serious effort made by the great powers, between 1815 and 1822, to govern Europe in concert. In general it proved that an alliance, to be effective, must be clearly defined as to its objects, and that in the long run the treaty in which these objects are defined must – to quote Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s somewhat cynical dictum – &quot;be reinforced by the interests&quot; of the parties concerned. Yet the &quot;moral alliance&quot; of Europe, as Count Karl Nesselrode called it, though it failed to secure the permanent harmony of the powers, was an effective instrument for peace during the years immediately following the downfall of Napoleon; and it set the precedent for those periodical meetings of the representatives of the powers, for the discussion and settlement of questions of international importance, which, though cumbrous and inefficient for constructive work, contributed much to the preservation of the general peace during much of the nineteenth century.

<text>Alexander Ramsey (September 8, 1815 April 22, 1903) was an American politician, who became the first Minnesota Territorial Governor and later became a U.S. Senator. He served as a Whig and Republican over a variety of offices between the 1840s and the 1880s.

==Early years and family==

Born in Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, on September 8, 1815, Alexander was the eldest of five children born to Thomas Ramsey and Elizabeth Kelker (also Kölliker or Köllker). His father was a blacksmith who committed suicide at age 42 when he went bankrupt in 1826, after signing for a note of a friend. Alexander lived with his uncle in Harrisburg, after his family split up to live with relatives. His brother Justus Cornelius Ramsey served in the Minnesota Territorial Legislature.

Ramsey first studied carpentry at Lafayette College but left during his third year. He read law with Hamilton Alricks, and attended Judge John Reed&#x27;s law school in Carlisle (now Penn State-Dickinson Law) in 1839. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1839.

In 1844 Ramsey married Anna Earl Jenks, daughter of Michael Hutchinson Jenks, and they had three children. Only one daughter, Marion, survived past childhood.

==Career==

Alexander Ramsey was elected from Pennsylvania as a Whig to the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the 28th and 29th congresses from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1847. He served as the first Territorial Governor of Minnesota from June 1, 1849, to May 15, 1853, as a member of the Whig Party.

Ramsey was of Scottish and German ancestry. In 1855, he became the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. Ramsey was elected the second Governor of Minnesota after statehood and served from January 2, 1860, to July 10, 1863. Ramsey is credited with being the first Union governor to commit troops during the American Civil War. He happened to be in Washington, D.C., when fighting broke out. When he heard about the firing on Fort Sumter he went straight to the White House and offered Minnesota&#x27;s services to Abraham Lincoln.

He resigned the governorship to become a U.S. Senator, having been elected to that post in 1863 as a Republican. He was re-elected in 1869 and held the office until March 3, 1875, serving in the 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, and 43rd congresses. He supported the Radical Republicans, who called for vigorous prosecution of the Civil War, and a military reconstruction of the South. He voted for the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson.
Ramsey called for the killing or removal of the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute Dakota from the state of Minnesota during the Dakota War of 1862. After pressing the Dakota to sell their land, he and other officials stole from the Dakota&#x27;s annuities. In response, some of the Dakota attacked American settlements, resulting in the death of at least 800 civilian men, women and children, and the displacement of thousands more. When the Fond du Lac band of Chippewa learned of the uprising they sent a letter to Ramsey to forward to President Lincoln offering to fight the Sioux dated September 6, 1862. A few days later on September 9 Ramsey addressed the state legislature proclaiming: &quot;The Sioux Indians of Minnesota must be exterminated or driven forever beyond the borders of the State,&quot; which he justified by citing various outrages against the settlers and violations of their treaties. In the north the Chippewa/Ojibwa were having problems with their Indian agent stealing from them. Gov. Ramsey lead a legislative commission to the Crow Wing agency to address their issues. There 10 chiefs of the Leech Lake and Mississippi bands laid out their concerns and offered to fight the Sioux for the government. The commission liked their offer and Gov. Ramsey invited the leaders of 22 bands of Ojibwa to St. Paul. They came on September 23 waving the America flag thinking their offers had been accepted. Ramsey had to instruct them that Major General Pope would not accept their service on the grounds that it would not be good public policy. However, they would be contacted if they were needed. In 1863, in response to continued raids on settlers, he authorized a bounty for the scalps of Dakota males.

On April 15, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. There were very few senior officials in D.C. that morning. Ramsey was and took part in initiating the transfer of the Presidency to Vice President Johnson.

Ramsey served as Secretary of War from 1879 to 1881, under President Rutherford B. Hayes. He was one of the commissioners to govern Utah from 1882 to 1886 under the Edmunds Act. The act made it illegal for polygamists to vote or hold office. Ramsey and four others were defendants in the Supreme Court case &quot;Murphy v. Ramsey&quot;, 114 U.S. 15 (1885). The Supreme Court upheld the federal law that denied polygamists the right to vote.

Late in the fall of 1885 ex-governor Ramsey escorted the son of Chippewa Chief Hole in the Day to Washington D.C. as Minnesota&#x27;s candidate to West Point.

==Legacy==
The Minnesota Historical Society preserves his home, the Alexander Ramsey House as a museum. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969.
Counties, towns, parks, and schools are named after Ramsey, including:
* Ramsey County, Minnesota, 
* Ramsey County, North Dakota 
* The city of Ramsey, Minnesota 
* The city of Ramsey, Illinois, 
*Alexander Ramsey Park in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, formerly a state park, it is the largest municipal park in Minnesota. 
* Ramsey Park in Stillwater, Minnesota 
* Hidden River Middle School in Saint Paul, Minnesota was formerly named after him. During the 2021–2022 school year, the school was renamed after approval from the St Paul School Board; staff and students had previously called for a name change in the spring of 2021. 
* Alexander Ramsey Elementary School in Montevideo, Minnesota. 
* Justice Page Middle School in Minneapolis, Minnesota was formerly named after him when it was first founded in 1932 (Ramsey International Fine Arts Center and formerly Alexander Ramsey Junior High School). In the 2016–17 school year, a student-initiated effort to rename Ramsey Middle School resulted in renaming the school after Alan Page, the first African-American Minnesota Supreme Court justice.

He was the namesake of the Liberty Ship SS &quot;Alexander Ramsey&quot; launched in 1942.

<text>In South Jersey and Philadelphia folklore in the United States, the Jersey Devil, also known as the Leeds Devil, is a legendary creature said to inhabit the forests of the Pine Barrens in South Jersey. The creature is often described as a flying biped with hooves, but there are many variations. The common description is that of a bipedal kangaroo-like or wyvern-like creature with a horse- or goat-like head, leathery bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, legs with cloven hooves, and a forked or pointed tail. It is also said that it has a strange elongated body and a thick tail. It has been reported to move quickly and is often described as emitting a high-pitched &quot;blood-curdling scream&quot;.

==Origin of the legend==
===Mother Leeds&#x27;s 13th child===
The popular legend of the Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is dated variously, and attached to various place names such as &quot;The Pines&quot; Pine Barrens, and Leeds Point. The devil&#x27;s mother is sometimes called a woman named Leeds, or &quot;Mother Leeds&quot; of Burlington, but other names such as the Shourds have been forwarded.

According to one précis, in 1735, a woman named Leeds was giving birth to her thirteenth child and exclaimed &quot;let the child be the devil!&quot;. The child, though born normally. immediately grew wings, tail, and claws and flew out to the Pine Barrens.

According to some the child transformed into a creature with hooves, a goat&#x27;s head, bat wings, and a forked tail. Growling and screaming, the child beat everyone with its tail before flying up the chimney and heading into the pines. In some versions of the tale, Mother Leeds was supposedly a witch and the child&#x27;s father was the devil himself. Some versions of the legend also state that local clergymen subsequently attempted to exorcise the creature from the Pine Barrens.

In a different telling, localized not at Leeds Point but at Esteville, near Mays Landing, a Mrs. Leeds became pregnant around 1855 and rejected her baby, wishing a stork would deliver a devil. Thus a winged devil was born and flew out the window; it would intermittently return but the mother would shoo it away.

===The Leeds family===
Prior to the early 1900s, the Jersey Devil was referred to as the Leeds Devil or the Devil of Leeds, either in connection with the local Leeds family or the eponymous Leeds Point in South Jersey.

&quot;Mother Leeds&quot; has been identified by some as the real-life Deborah Leeds, on grounds that Deborah Leeds&#x27; husband, Japhet Leeds, named twelve children in the will he wrote during 1736, which is compatible with the legend. Deborah and Japhet Leeds also lived in the Leeds Point section of what is now Atlantic County, New Jersey, which is commonly the location of the Jersey Devil story.

Brian Regal, a historian of science at Kean University, theorizes that the story of Mother Leeds, rather than being based on a single historical person alone, originated from the reputation of the local prominent Leeds family in the southern portion of the colonial-era Province of New Jersey, where religious-political disputes became the subject of folklore and gossip among the local population. Regal contends that folk legends concerning these historical disputes evolved through the years and ultimately resulted in the modern popular legend of the Jersey Devil during the early 20th century. Regal contends that &quot;colonial-era political intrigue&quot; involving early New Jersey politicians, Benjamin Franklin, and Franklin&#x27;s rival almanac publisher Daniel Leeds (1651–1720) resulted in the Leeds family being described as &quot;monsters&quot;, and it was Daniel Leeds&#x27; negative description as the &quot;Leeds Devil&quot;, rather than any actual creature, that created the later legend of the Jersey Devil.

Much like the Mother Leeds of the Jersey Devil myth, Daniel Leeds&#x27; third wife had given birth to nine children, a large number of children even for the time. Leeds&#x27; second wife and first daughter had both died during childbirth. Leeds and his family were prominent in the South Jersey and Pine Barrens area. As a royal surveyor with strong allegiance to the British crown, Leeds had surveyed and acquired land in the Egg Harbor area, located within the Pine Barrens. The land was inherited by Leeds&#x27; sons and family and is now known as Leeds Point, one of the areas in the Pine Barrens currently most associated with the Jersey Devil legend and alleged Jersey Devil sightings.

Starting in the 17th century, English Quakers established settlements in Southern Jersey, the region in which the Pine Barrens are located. Daniel Leeds, a Quaker and a prominent person of pre-Revolution colonial southern New Jersey, became ostracized by his Quaker congregation after his 1687 publication of almanacs containing astrological symbols and writings. Leeds&#x27; fellow Quakers deemed the astrology in these almanacs as too &quot;pagan&quot; or blasphemous, and the almanacs were censored and destroyed by the local Quaker community.

In response to and in spite of this censorship, Leeds continued to publish even more esoteric astrological Christian writings and became increasingly fascinated with Christian occultism, Christian mysticism, cosmology, demonology and angelology, and natural magic. In the 1690s, after his almanacs and writings were further censored as blasphemous or heretical by the Philadelphia Quaker Meeting, Leeds continued to dispute with the Quaker community, converting to Anglicanism and publishing anti-Quaker tracts criticizing Quaker theology and accusing Quakers of being anti-monarchists. In the ensuing dispute between Leeds and the southern New Jersey Quakers over Leeds&#x27; accusations, Leeds was endorsed by the much-maligned British royal governor of New Jersey, Lord Cornbury, despised among the Quaker communities. Leeds also worked as a councilor to Lord Cornbury about this time. Considering Leeds as a traitor for aiding the Crown and rejecting Quaker beliefs, the Quaker Burlington Meeting of southern New Jersey subsequently dismissed Leeds as &quot;evil&quot;. In 1700, the local South Jersey Quaker community retaliated against Leeds’ anti-Quaker tracts with their own tract, &quot;Satan’s Harbinger Encountered … Being Something by Way of Answer to Daniel Leeds&quot;, which publicly
accused Leeds of working for the devil.

During 1716, Daniel Leeds&#x27; son, Titan Leeds, inherited his father&#x27;s almanac business, which continued to use astrological content and eventually competed with Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s popular &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Almanack&quot;. The competition between the two men intensified when, during 1733, Franklin satirically used astrology in his almanac to predict Titan Leeds&#x27; death on October of that same year. Though Franklin&#x27;s prediction was intended as a joke at his competitor&#x27;s expense and a means to boost almanac sales, Titan Leeds was apparently offended at the death prediction, publishing a public admonition of Franklin as a &quot;fool&quot; and a &quot;liar&quot;. In a published response, Franklin mocked Titan Leeds&#x27; outrage and humorously suggested that, in fact, Titan Leeds had died in accordance with the earlier prediction and was thus writing his almanacs as a ghost, resurrected from the grave to haunt and torment Franklin. Franklin continued to jokingly refer to Titan Leeds as a &quot;ghost&quot; even after Titan Leeds&#x27; actual death in 1738. Daniel Leeds&#x27; blasphemous and occultist reputation and his pro-monarchy stance in the largely anti-monarchist colonial south of New Jersey, combined with Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s later continuous depiction of his son Titan Leeds as a ghost, may have originated or contributed to the local folk legend of a so-called &quot;Leeds Devil&quot; lurking in the Pine Barrens.

During 1728, Titan Leeds began to include the Leeds family crest on the masthead of his almanacs. The Leeds family crest depicted a wyvern, a bat-winged dragon-like legendary creature that stands upright on two clawed feet. Regal notes that the wyvern on the Leeds family crest is reminiscent of the popular descriptions of the Jersey Devil. The inclusion of this family crest on Leeds&#x27; almanacs may have further contributed to the Leeds family&#x27;s poor reputation among locals and possibly influenced the popular descriptions of the Leeds Devil or Jersey Devil. The fearsome appearance of the crest&#x27;s wyvern and the increasing animosity among local South Jersey residents towards royalty, aristocracy, and nobility (with whom family crests were associated) may have helped facilitate the legend of the Leeds Devil and the association of the Leeds family with &quot;devils&quot; and &quot;monsters&quot;.

===The Leeds Devil===
Regal notes that, by the late 18th century and the early 19th century at the latest, the &quot;Leeds Devil&quot; had become an ubiquitous legendary monster or ghost story in present-day South Jersey. In the early to mid-19th century, stories continued to circulate in southern New Jersey of the Leeds Devil, a &quot;monster wandering the Pine Barrens.&quot; An oral tradition of &quot;Leeds Devil&quot; monster/ghost stories became well-established in the Pine Barrens area.

Although the &quot;Leeds Devil&quot; legend has existed since the 18th century, Regal states that the more modern depiction of the Jersey Devil, as well as the now pervasive &quot;Jersey Devil&quot; name, first became truly standardized in current form during the early 20th century:

During the pre-Revolutionary period, the Leeds family, who called the Pine Barrens home, soured its relationship with the Quaker majority ... The Quakers saw no hurry to give their former fellow religionist an easy time in circles of gossip. His wives had all died, as had several children. His son Titan stood accused by Benjamin Franklin of being a ghost ... The family crest had winged dragons on it. In a time when thoughts of independence were being born, these issues made the Leeds family political and religious monsters. From all this over time the legend of the Leeds Devil was born. References to the &#x27;Jersey Devil&#x27; do not appear in newspapers or other printed material until the twentieth century. The first major flap came in 1909. It is from these sightings that the popular image of the creature—batlike wings, horse head, claws, and general air of a dragon—became standardized.
Indeed, many references to a &quot;Leeds Devil&quot; or &quot;Devil of Leeds&quot; appear in earlier printed material prior to the widespread usage of the &quot;Jersey Devil&quot; name. During 1859, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; published an article detailing the Leeds Devil folk tales popular among Pine Barren residents (or &quot;pine rats&quot;.) A newspaper from 1887 describes sightings of a winged creature, referred to as &quot;the Devil of Leeds&quot;, allegedly spotted near the Pine Barrens and well known among the local populace of Burlington County, New Jersey:

Whenever he went near it, it would give a most unearthly yell that frightened the dogs. It whipped at every dog on the place. &quot;That thing,&quot; said the colonel, &quot;is not a bird nor an animal, but it is the Leeds devil, according to the description, and it was born over in Evesham, Burlington County, a hundred years ago. There is no mistake about it. I never saw the horrible critter myself, but I can remember well when it was roaming around in Evesham woods fifty years ago, and when it was hunted by men and dogs and shot at by the best marksmen there were in all South Jersey but could not be killed. There isn&#x27;t a family in Burlington or any of the adjoining counties that does not know of the Leeds devil, and it was the bugaboo to frighten children with when I was a boy.

==Reported sightings==
There have been many claims of sightings and occurrences involving the Jersey Devil.

According to legend, while visiting the Hanover Mill Works to inspect his cannonballs being forged, Commodore Stephen Decatur sighted a flying creature and fired a cannonball directly upon it, to no effect.

Joseph Bonaparte, elder brother of Napoleon, is also claimed to have seen the Jersey Devil while hunting on his Bordentown estate about 1820.

During 1840, the Jersey Devil was blamed for several livestock killings. Similar attacks were reported during 1841, accompanied by tracks and screams.

In Greenwich Township, in December 1925, a local farmer shot an unidentified animal as it attempted to steal his chickens, and then photographed the corpse. Afterward, he claimed that none of 100 people he showed it to could identify it. On July 27, 1937, an unknown animal &quot;with red eyes&quot; seen by residents of Downingtown, Pennsylvania was compared to the Jersey Devil by a reporter for the &quot;Pennsylvania Bulletin&quot; of July 28, 1937. In 1951, a group of Gibbstown, New Jersey boys claimed to have seen a &#x27;monster&#x27; matching the Devil&#x27;s description and claims of a corpse matching the Jersey Devil&#x27;s description arose in 1957. During 1960, tracks and noises heard near Mays Landing were claimed to be from the Jersey Devil. During the same year the merchants around Camden offered a $10,000 reward for the capture of the Jersey Devil, even offering to build a private zoo to house the creature if it was captured.

===Wave of sightings in 1909===
During the week of January 16–23, 1909, newspapers published hundreds of claimed encounters with the Jersey Devil from all over South Jersey and the Philadelphia area. Among these alleged encounters were claims the creature &quot;attacked&quot; a trolley car in Haddon Heights and a social club in Camden. Police in Camden and Bristol, Pennsylvania supposedly fired on the creature to no effect. Other reports initially concerned unidentified footprints in the snow, but soon sightings of creatures resembling the Jersey Devil were being reported throughout South Jersey and as far away as Delaware and western Maryland. The widespread newspaper coverage created fear throughout the Delaware Valley prompting a number of schools to close and workers to stay home. Vigilante groups and groups of hunters roamed the pines and countrysides in search of the devil. During this period, it is rumored that the Philadelphia Zoo posted a $10,000 reward for the creature. The offer prompted a variety of hoaxes, including a kangaroo equipped with artificial claws and bat wings.

==Description and explanation==
Skeptics believe the Jersey Devil to be nothing more than a creative manifestation upon the imaginations of the early English settlers in South Jersey, with plausible natural explanations including: bogeyman stories created and told by bored Pine Barren residents as a form of children&#x27;s entertainment; the byproduct of the historical local disdain for the Leeds family; the misidentification of known animals; and rumors based on common negative perceptions of the local rural population of the Pine Barren (known as &quot;pineys&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;CSI/SI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The frightening reputation of the Pine Barrens may indeed have contributed to the Jersey Devil legend. Historically, the Pine Barrens was considered inhospitable land. Gangs of highwaymen, such as the politically disdained Loyalist brigands, known as the Pine Robbers, were known to rob and attack travelers passing through the Barrens. During the 18th century and the 19th century, residents of the isolated Pine Barrens were deemed the dregs or outcasts of society: poor farmers, fugitives, brigands, Native Americans, poachers, moonshiners, runaway slaves, and deserting soldiers. So-called pineys have sometimes fostered certain frightening stories about themselves and the Pine Barrens to discourage outsiders or intruders from entering the Barrens. Pineys were further demonized and vilified after two eugenics studies were published during the early 20th century, which depicted pineys as congenital idiots and criminals, as seen in the research performed on &quot;The Kallikak Family&quot; by Henry H. Goddard, which is now considered biased, inaccurate, unscientific, and, most likely, falsified.

Due in part to their isolated and undeveloped nature, the Pine Barrens have themselves fostered various folk legends. Apart from the Jersey Devil, many other legends are associated with the Pine Barrens; supernatural creatures and ghosts said to haunt the pine forests include the ghost of the pirate Captain Kidd, who supposedly buried treasure in the Pine Barrens and is sometimes allegedly seen in the company of the Jersey Devil; the ghost of the Black Doctor, the benevolent spirit of an African-American doctor who, after being forbidden from practicing medicine due to his race, entered the Pine Barrens to practice medicine in the isolated communities of the Barrens and is said to still come to the aid of lost or injured travelers; the ghost of the Black Dog, which, unlike many black dog legends, is usually portrayed as harmless; the ghost of the Golden-Haired Girl, the spirit of a girl who is said to be staring out into the sea, dressed in white, mourning the loss of her lover at sea; and the White Stag, a ghostly white deer said to rescue travelers in the Barrens from danger. There are also folk tales concerning the Blue Hole, an unusually clear blue and rounded body of water located in the Pine Barrens between Monroe Township, Gloucester County and Winslow Township, Camden County and often associated with the Jersey Devil.

Jeff Brunner of the Humane Society of New Jersey thinks that “vagrant” sandhill cranes are partially the basis of the Jersey Devil stories, adding, &quot;There are no photographs, no bones, no hard evidence whatsoever, and worst of all, no explanation of its origins that doesn&#x27;t require belief in the supernatural.&quot; Sandhill cranes are not indigenous or well-known to South Jersey, are approximately the same size as the alleged Jersey Devil, and produce distinctive loud vocalizations; as unfamiliar animals with a distinctively loud, trumpeting call, wayward or vagrant migrating Sandhill cranes that ended up in South Jersey would thus potentially startle or frighten Pine Barren residents at night or under other circumstances in which the animal’s true appearance was unclear. 

Outdoorsman and author Tom Brown Jr. spent several seasons living in the wilderness of the Pine Barrens. He recounts occasions when terrified hikers mistook him for the Jersey Devil, after he covered his whole body with mud to repel mosquitoes.

Medical sociologist Robert E. Bartholomew and author Peter Hassall cite the infamous 1909 series of sightings of the Jersey Devil (and the subsequent public panic) as a classic example of mass hysteria begun by a regional urban legend.

One New Jersey group called the &quot;Devil Hunters&quot; refer to themselves as &quot;official researchers of the Jersey Devil&quot;, and devote time to collecting reports, visiting historic sites, and going on nocturnal hunts in the Pine Barrens in order to &quot;find proof that the Jersey Devil does in fact exist.&quot;

Writing in Jan Harold Brunvand&#x27;s &quot;American Folklore: An Encyclopedia&quot;, Rutgers Professor Angus Kress Gillespie called the Jersey Devil &quot;an obscure regional legend&quot; for most of its existence, and said that &quot;after more than 250 years in oral circulation, the legend of the &#x27;Jersey Devil&#x27; has many variations ...&quot;. Gillespie cites the Devil&#x27;s image used on T-shirts, buttons, and postcards, and cocktails named after the Devil, as indications that &quot;the recent history of the Jersey Devil is more in the realm of popular culture than folklore&quot;.

Writer Dan Evon noticed some similarities between the Jersey Devil and an existing megabat species found in Africa, &quot;Hypsignathus monstrosus&quot;.

===Hoaxes===
Gordon Stein in &quot;Encyclopedia of Hoaxes&quot; (1993) noted that the alleged footprints of the Jersey Devil during 1909 resembled a horse&#x27;s hoof. According to Stein, a man later admitted he had faked some of these footprints.

Geoff Tibballs in &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Hoaxes&quot; (2006) has claimed that Norman Jeffries was involved in hoaxing the Jersey Devil:

He also planted nonfictional newspaper stories about new sightings of the Devil. During 1909, Jeffries with his friend Jacob Hope, an animal trainer, purchased a kangaroo from a circus and glued artificial claws and bat wings onto it. They declared to the public they had captured the Devil and it was displayed at the museum. Twenty years later, Jeffries admitted to the hoax.

==Cultural relevance==

In &quot;Man and Beast in American Comic Legend&quot;, folklorist Richard Dorson outlines six criteria for establishing distinction among legendary creatures of American folklore. While the Jersey Devil was not expressly cited by Dorson, it nevertheless qualifies for this same level of relevance. Dorson specifies that the qualifier must: exist in oral tradition, inspire belief and conviction, become personalized and institutionalized, be fanciful or mythical , and contain a &quot;comical side,&quot; which endears it to the American public.

Oral tradition of the Jersey Devil well predates printed newspaper accounts, and belief in its existence by many continues. The latter is made evident not only by commentators who elaborate on this possibility but also by investigative programs such as &quot;Mother Leeds&#x27; 13th Child,&quot; &quot;In Search of Monsters&quot;, Lore and &quot;Monsters and Mysteries in America&quot;.

As a fixture of organizations, it is the namesake for two professional ice hockey teams. The first, the Jersey Devils of the Eastern Hockey League, played from 1964 until the league folded in 1973. The second, the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, have played since 1982. The current team was formerly known as the Colorado Rockies, and their name was chosen by a poll shortly after the team relocated to New Jersey. This same trend towards cultural incorporation is further exemplified by the Jersey Devil&#x27;s appropriation in toy lines, such as its inclusion as a vinyl figure in Cryptozoic Entertainment &quot;Cryptkins&quot; blind box, as well as its application as a motif by Six Flags Great Adventure for their Jersey Devil Coaster developed by Rocky Mountain Construction.

Moreover, the Jersey Devil&#x27;s fanciful or mythical nature is explored in the numerous works of fantasy it makes an appearance in, including: &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Jersey Devil (video game)&quot;, &quot;The Wolf Among Us&quot;, &quot;13th Child&quot;, &quot;TMNT&quot;, &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;, &quot;The Barrens&quot;, &quot;Carny&quot;, &quot;Poptropica&quot;, &quot;A Night With The Jersey Devil&quot;, &quot;The Last Broadcast&quot;, &quot;Legend Quest&quot;, &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls, Fallout 76,&quot; Inscryption,&quot; &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters and Supernatural&quot;; many of which, such as &quot;TMNT&quot; and &quot;Jersey Devil&quot; (video game), not only reflect the Jersey Devil&#x27;s mythical character but exemplify its comical nature as well.

<text>John Roebuck of Kinneil FRS FRSE (1718 – 17 July 1794) was an English industrialist, inventor, mechanical engineer, and physician who played an important role in the Industrial Revolution and who is known for developing the industrial-scale manufacture of sulfuric acid.

==Life and work==

John Roebuck was born in Sheffield, where his father, also John Roebuck, had a prosperous manufacturing business.

After attending Sheffield Grammar School and Dr. Philip Doddridge&#x27;s academy at Northampton, Roebuck studied medicine at Edinburgh, where he developed a taste for chemistry from the lectures of William Cullen and Joseph Black. He finally graduated M.D. at the University of Leiden in 1742. Roebuck started medical practice at Birmingham, but devoted much of his time to chemistry, especially its practical applications. Among the most important of his early achievements in this field was the introduction, in 1746, of leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid. Together with Samuel Garbett, in 1749 he built a factory at Prestonpans, in Scotland, for the production of the acid, and for some years they enjoyed a monopoly. Having neglected to take out patents, Roebuck&#x27;s was unable to prevent others from making use of his methods as they eventually became known.

Roebuck next became involved in the manufacture of iron, and in 1759 founded the Carron Company ironworks at Carron, Stirlingshire with Garbett and other partners (Ebenezer Roebuck, Thomas Roebuck, William Cadell, William Cadell and Benjamin Roebuck). There he introduced various improvements in methods of production, including the conversion (patented in 1762) of cast iron into malleable iron &quot;by the action of a hollow pit-coal fire&quot; urged by a powerful artificial blast. Ebenezer was killed in 1771 in a &quot;melancholy accident: While viewing the works, a huge piece of iron fell on this gentleman, which killed him on the ſpot&quot;. Ebenezer had been a vigorous contributor to the success of the ironworks, and quality declined after his death. Its Royal Navy contracts were cancelled in 1773 and a Royal Artillery inspection in 1774 found that &quot;on the death of [Ebenezer] Roebuck the Carron Guns had through the carelessness of the workmen very much deteriorated, and the firm lost ground.&quot;

Roebuck had also leased a colliery at Bo&#x27;ness to supply coal to the Carron Works, but in sinking for new seams he encountered such quantities of water that the Newcomen engine used was unable to keep the pit clear. Hearing of James Watt&#x27;s engine, Roebuck contacted its inventor. This engine also proved inadequate, but Roebuck became a strong believer in its future. In return for a two-thirds share in the invention he assisted Watt in perfecting its details by paying Watt&#x27;s debts and by providing him with a place to work. The workplace became known as James Watt&#x27;s Cottage and was built in a secluded area of Kinneil House as Roebuck was worried about industrial espionage.

Roebuck&#x27;s troubles at the Carron Works and the colliery, aggravated by the failure of an attempt to manufacture alkali, brought him into financial difficulties and he was forced to sell his share in Watt&#x27;s engine to Matthew Boulton in return for cancellation of a £1200 debt. Subsequently, though Roebuck had to give up his interest in the Bo&#x27;ness works, he continued to manage them and to reside at the neighbouring Kinneil House, where he occupied himself with farming on a considerable scale.

In 1784, Roebuck obtained a pottery from the Cadell family where he pursued his interest in new technologies.

Roebuck died in Edinburgh in 1794 and was buried at Carriden Churchyard near Bo&#x27;ness.

He was grandfather to John Arthur Roebuck.

<text>Philip Doddridge D.D. (26 June 1702 – 26 October 1751) was an English Nonconformist (specifically, Congregationalist) minister, educator, and hymnwriter.

==Early life==
Philip Doddridge was born in London, the last of the twenty children of Daniel Doddridge (d 1715), a dealer in oils and pickles. His father was a son of John Doddridge (1621–1689), rector of Shepperton, Middlesex, who was ejected from his living following the Act of Uniformity of 1662 and became a Nonconformist minister, and a great-nephew of the judge and MP Sir John Doddridge (1555–1628). Philip&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth, considered to have been the greater influence on him, was the orphan daughter of the Rev John Bauman (d. 1675), a Lutheran clergyman who had fled from Prague to escape religious persecution, during the unsettled period following the flight of the Elector Palatine. In England, the Rev John Bauman (sometimes written &quot;Bowerman&quot;) was appointed master of the grammar school at Kingston upon Thames.

Before Philip could read, his mother began to teach him the history of the Old and New Testament from blue Dutch chimney-tiles on the chimney place of their sitting room. In his youth, Philip Doddridge was educated first by a tutor employed by his parent then boarded at a private school in London. In 1712, he then attended the grammar school at Kingston-upon-Thames, where his maternal grandfather had been master. The school&#x27;s master when Doddridge attended, was Rev Daniel Mayo (1672-1733), the son of John Bauman&#x27;s friend Richard Mayo, ejected vicar of Kingston-upon-Thames.

His mother died on 12 April 1711, when he was eight years old. His father died on 17 July 1715. He then had a guardian named Downes who moved him to another private school at St Albans, where he was much influenced by the Presbyterian minister Samuel Clarke of St Albans. Downes squandered Doddridge&#x27;s inheritance, leaving the orphaned 13-year-old Philip Doddridge destitute in St Albans. Here, Clarke took him on, treating him as a son, guiding his education and encouraging his call to the ministry; they remained lifelong friends. Doddridge preached at the funeral of his older friend in 1750, remarking: &quot;To him under God I owe even myself and all my opportunities of public usefulness in the church.&quot;

==Marriage==
On 22 December 1730 he married Mercy Maris after a seven-month courtship (1709–1790), daughter of Richard Maris, a baker and maltster of Worcester, and his second wife, Elizabeth Brindley. The marriage was at Upton-upon-Severn where Mercy&#x27;s family lived. They had nine children. The first, Elizabeth or Tetsey (1731–1736), died just before her fifth birthday and was buried under the platform of the Doddridge Chapel, Northampton. Four children survived to adulthood. The correspondence between them provides an insight into their lives.

==Contribution to education and religious life==
With independent religious leanings, Doddridge declined offers which would have led him into the Anglican ministry or a career in law; and in 1719, with Clarke&#x27;s support, chose instead to enter the Dissenting academy at Kibworth in Leicestershire. Here Doddridge was taught by John Jennings, whom he briefly succeeded in 1723. Later that year, at a general meeting of Nonconformist ministers, Doddridge was chosen to conduct the academy being newly established a few miles away at Market Harborough. It moved many times, and was known as Northampton Academy. After his death in 1751, the academy continued; it is probably best known as Daventry Academy.

In 1729 he received an invitation to be pastor to an independent congregation at Northampton, which he also accepted. Here his popularity as a preacher is said to have been chiefly due to his &quot;high susceptibility, joined with physical advantages and perfect sincerity&quot;. His sermons were mostly practical in character, and his aim was to cultivate in his hearers a spiritual and devotional frame of mind.

Throughout the 1730s and 1740s Doddridge continued his academic and pastoral work, and developed close relations with numerous early religious revivalists and independents, through extensive visits and correspondence. Through this approach he helped establish and maintain a circle of influential independent religious thinkers and writers, including Isaac Watts. He also became a prolific author and hymnwriter. In 1736 both the universities at Aberdeen gave him the degree of Doctor of Divinity. However, these multifarious labours led to so many engagements and bulky correspondence as to interfere seriously both with his preaching and academic duties (he had some 200 students to whom he lectured on philosophy and theology, in the mathematical or Spinozistic style).

His &quot;The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul&quot; was translated into seven languages. Charles Spurgeon referred to &quot;The Rise and Progress&quot; as &quot;that holy book&quot;. Besides a New Testament commentary and other theological works, Doddridge also wrote over 400 hymns. Most of the hymns were written as summaries of his sermons and were to help the congregation express their response to the truths they were being taught.

==Hymns==
Doddridge was known for ending his sermons with newly crafted hymns as summaries of the lessons, but his hymns were not published during his lifetime. The first posthumous edition contained 370 hymns. Many of Doddridge&#x27;s hymns, such as &quot;O God of Bethel, by whose hand&quot;, continue to be used to this day across the English-speaking world. &quot;O God of Bethel&quot; appears as № 497 in The Hymnal 1940, and № 709 in The Hymnal 1982 of the Episcopal Church, and as № 269 in the Presbyterian Hymnal (1990). &quot;How Gentle God&#x27;s Commands&quot; appears as № 69 in the Methodist Hymnal (1939), № 53 in the Methodist Hymnal (1966), and as № 681 in the Trinity Hymnal (1990). The Advent section of &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; begins with № 239 &quot;Hark the Glad Sound!&quot; The Sacred Harp includes ten of his hymn texts, the most popular being &quot;The Last Words of Copernicus&quot; on page 112.

==Doddridge&#x27;s Youth&#x27;s Scheme==
Concerned at the small number of students attending the Dissenting academies, in 1750 Doddridge initiated a &quot;Youth&#x27;s Scheme&quot;, to provide capable boys from poor families with a grammar school education that would enable them to undertake further study at a Dissenting academy. Doddridge used this subscription-funded Youth&#x27;s Scheme to attach a preparatory school to Northampton Academy, initially with six students.

Samuel Smith had been recommended and was supported by Doddridge&#x27;s friend Robert Cruttenden. Doddridge now had thirty &#x27;pupils&#x27; in his Academy, and six &#x27;students&#x27; in his school. Initially, the senior students at the Academy were responsible for teaching the students, but had he lived, it was his intention to employ a third tutor, alongside himself and Samuel Clark. The Youth&#x27;s Scheme did not survive Doddridge&#x27;s death.

==Death and legacy==

In 1751, Doddridge&#x27;s health, which had never been good, broke down. He sailed for Lisbon on 30 September of that year; the change was unavailing, and he died there of tuberculosis. He was buried in the British Cemetery, Lisbon, where his grave may be seen. A second tombstone was added to his grave in 1828.

Doddridge worked towards a united Nonconformist body that would have wide appeal, retaining highly cultured elements without alienating those less educated. His best known work, &quot;The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul&quot; (1745), dedicated to Isaac Watts, was often reprinted and became widely influential. It was through reading it, together with Isaac Milner, that William Wilberforce began the spiritual journey which eventually led to his conversion. It is said that this work best illustrates Doddridge&#x27;s religious genius, and it has been widely translated. His other well-known works include: &quot;The Family Expositor&quot; (6 vols., 1739–1756); &quot;Life of Colonel Gardiner&quot; (1747); and a &quot;Course of Lectures on Pneumatology, Ethics and Divinity&quot; (1763). Doddridge also published several courses of sermons on particular topics.

John Wesley stated, in the Preface to his &quot;Notes on the New Testament&quot;, that he was indebted to &quot;the &quot;Family Expositor&quot; of the late pious and learned Dr. Doddridge&quot; for some &quot;useful observations&quot;.

Doddridge&#x27;s academy evolved into New College, Hampstead, later known as New College London, a centre for training Congregational and then United Reformed Church ministers. (This college is not connected with Royal Holloway, University of London, also a constituent college of the University of London and briefly known as &quot;Royal Holloway and Bedford New College&quot; when those two colleges merged in the 1970s.) The library of the college, which held a large collection of his manuscripts, was transferred to Dr Williams&#x27;s Library in 1976.

==Doddridge United Reformed Church==
The Doddridge United Reformed Church (formerly the Castle Hill URC) in Doddridge Street, Northampton, was formerly Congregational, Doddridge and Commercial Street URC. It was the scene of the ministry of Doddridge from 1729 to 1751. The church was founded in 1662, built in 1695 and enlarged in 1842. It united with Commercial Street church in 1959 and became a United Reformed Church in 1972. The interior has galleries and box pews and a memorial to Doddridge. The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage in 1952.

<doc id="250794" wikidata="Q14272" url="?curid=250794" title="Geraniales">
<text>Geraniales is a small order of flowering plants, included within the rosid subclade of eudicots. The largest family in the order is Geraniaceae with over 800 species. In addition, the order includes the smaller Francoaceae with about 40 species. Most Geraniales are herbaceous, but there are also shrubs and small trees.

Flower morphology of the Geraniales is rather conserved. They are usually perfectly pentamerous and pentacyclic without fused organs besides the carpels of the superior gynoecium. The androecium is obdiplostemonous. Only a few genera are tetramerous (&quot;Francoa, Tetilla, Melianthus&quot;). In some genera some stamens (&quot;Pelargonium&quot;) or a complete whorl of stamens are reduced (&quot;Erodium, Melianthus&quot;). In the genera &quot;Hypseocharis&quot; and &quot;Monsonia&quot; there are 15 instead of the usual ten stamens. Most genera bear nectariferous flowers. The nectary glands are formed by the receptacle and are localised at the bases of the antesepalous stamens.

The economic importance of Geraniales is low. Some species of the genus &quot;Pelargonium&quot; (Geraniaceae) are cultivated for their aromatic oil used in the perfume industry. Some other species, also mostly within Geraniaceae, have horticultural or medicinal uses. A Paleobotanic record is missing.

==Taxonomy ==

=== Origins ===
The botanical authority for Geraniales is given to Jussieu, but since the original description did not fulfill all the rules for a valid publication and was subsequently validly published, attribution is given to both Jussieu and the subsequent publication, hence the designation Geraniales Juss. &quot;ex&quot; Bercht. &amp; J.Presl Jussieu, who developed the concept of botanical families, described the Gerania, as a grouping of five genera, including &quot;Geranium&quot;. Although Jussieu used the term &quot;Ordo&quot; this did not correspond to current understandings of the term Order. The subsequent attribution occurred in 1820, in the Czech text &quot;O Prirozenosti Rostlin&quot;, by Friedrich von Berchtold and Jan Svatopluk Presl, hence &quot;ex Bercht. &amp; J.Presl&quot;. However, Berchtold and Presl also only described a &quot;rad&quot; (ordo) of five genera, which they called Geraniae. Other authorities have given the authority to Dumortier who described the family Geraniaceae, consisting of two tribes, Pelargonieae and Geranieae, each with three genera.

===Circumscription ===
Geraniales contains two families, 11 genera and about 830 species. For a historical account of the circumscription of the order, see Price and Palmer (1993) Table 1.

Under the Cronquist system (1988), the Geraniales comprised the following five families:
* family &quot;Geraniaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Oxalidaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Limnanthaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Tropaeolaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Balsaminaceae&quot;

While the Dahlgren system (1980) was much larger in circumscription with 16 families, only two of which were in Cronquist&#x27;s construction, and placed the order in the superorder Rutiflorae:
* family &quot;Zygophyllaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Nitrariaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Peganaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Balanitaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Erythroxylaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Humiriaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Linaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Ctenolophonaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Ixonanthaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Lepidobotryaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Oxalidaceae&quot; (including Averrhoaceae)
* family &quot;Geraniaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Dirachmaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Ledocarpaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Vivianiaceae&quot;
* family &quot;Biebersteiniaceae&quot;

Other modern systems include those of Takhtajan (1987) with nine families, and Thorne (1992). Thorne&#x27;s system was the same as Cronquist&#x27;s except that Biebersteiniaceae, Dirachmaceae, Ledocarpaceae, and Vivianiaceae were reduced to subfamilies of Geraniaceae.

=== Molecular phylogenetics: Angiosperm Phylogeny Group ===
The elucidation of the relationships within the order by morphological or cytological methods alone had proven difficult as demonstrated by the widely different treatment by various authorities. For instance Cronquist and Thorne immersed the families Biebersteiniaceae, Dirachmaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae within Geraniaceae (Geraniaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;), whereas Dahlgren and others maintained them as separate taxa, maintaining a &quot;core&quot; Geraniaceae (Geraniaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;). Price and Palmer (1993) were among the first investigators to apply molecular phylogenetics to this order, using the chloroplast gene &quot;rbc&quot;L. This disassembled the traditional morphologically defined grouping of dicotyledons, replacing it with a series of nested clades. The Geraniales segregated in the eudicot clade, specifically in the rosid subclade.

The family circumscription of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) of 1998 placed Geraniales Dumort. amongst the rosids with the following six families:

Geraniales 1829
* Francoaceae , 1832
* Geraniaceae , 1789 [ + Hypseocharitaceae , 1861]
* Greyiaceae , 1926
* Ledocarpaceae , 1834
* Melianthaceae , 1820
* Vivianiaceae , 1836

Hypseocharitaceae were a small family of eight species of the genus Hypseocharis found in the tropical mountainous regions of the Andes. The APG provided the option of considering them as a separate family or subsumed into Geraniaceae. By 2003, when the APG was published, it was apparent that the small families Francoaceae, Greyiaceae and Melianthaceae were closely related and were collapsed into one family as Melanthiaceae with Francoaceae as an optional synonym. Thus the number of families was reduced to four.

The APG III classification (2009) was typical of newer arrangements. In this definition, Hypseocharitaceae was included within Geraniaceae, Francoaceae and Greyiaceae were included within Melianthaceae, and Ledocarpaceae was included within the Vivianiaceae.

However, Considerable rearrangements took place in the 2016 APG IV system. Francoaceae was substituted for Melianthaceae,
due to nomenclatural priority. The latter subsumed Vivianiaceae based on the work of Sytsma, Spalink &amp; Berger (2014). However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the relationships within Francoaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;s.s.&quot;), Melianthaceae (Bersama
Fresen. and Melianthus L.) and Ledocarpaceae. Here, Vivianiaceae is used as a later synonym for Ledocarpaceae. This due to conflicting evidence (see Palazzesi &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012). The APG chose to follow the broader circumscription for the time being till these differences are resolved.

This leaves the order Geraniales with only two families: Geraniaceae and Francoaceae (including Bersamaceae, Greyiaceae, Ledocarpaceae, Melianthaceae, Rhynchothecaceae and Vivianiaceae).

The Vivianiaceae and Ledocarpaceae were included within the Geraniaceae, and the Hypseocharitaceae within the Oxalidaceae, which are now treated in the order Oxalidales. The Melianthaceae were placed within the Sapindales, the Greyiaceae and Francoaceae within the Rosales, the latter subsumed within the Saxifragaceae.

Recent comparison of DNA-fragments from species within the order resulted in the following phylogenetic tree.

<doc id="250796" wikidata="Q7490428" url="?curid=250796" title="Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company">
<text>Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company was the manufacturer of the Sharps Rifle. The company was organized by Samuel Robbins and Richard S. Lawrence as a holding company in Hartford, Connecticut, on October 9, 1851 with $100,000 in capital. Despite Sharps departing from the company bearing his name, Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company produced over 100,000 rifles, but it dissolved in 1881 with the widespread use of repeating rifles.

==History==

Christian Sharps (1810–1874), patented his rifle in 1848. The first contract for 5,000 rifles was in 1850 and manufacturing started in 1851. The Model 1851 &quot;box-lock&quot; was developed by Christian Sharps, Rollin White, and Richard Lawrence at Robbins &amp; Lawrence of Windsor, Vermont. The second contract for 15,000 rifles was so large that no suitable land was available in Windsor, Vermont. The holding company advanced Robbins &amp; Lawrence $40,000 to purchase of land in Hartford, Connecticut, and to erect a brick factory building.

Christian Sharps left the Company in 1853. He later formed a partnership with William Hankins in 1862, known as Sharps &amp; Hankins. In 1855, manufacturing was moved to Hartford and continued until 1876. Operations were then moved to Bridgeport, Connecticut.

In 1872, Sharps introduced the .50-90 Sharps hunting cartridge. Hugo Borchardt designed the last rifle made by the company, the Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878, but the company went bankrupt and was defunct three years later in 1881.

The Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company produced over 100,000 firearms during the US Civil War for the Union Army, but the company was plagued by lawsuits and eventually succumbed to a shifting marketplace as repeating rifles became more popular with shooters.


==Legacy==
The building of the defunct company was occupied in 1883 by Annsville Wire Mills, which moved out from Annsville, New York after a fire, and later by a typewriter company.

Reproductions of the paper cartridge Sharps 1863 Rifle, the metallic cartridge 1874 Sharps Rifle, and Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 are manufactured today for use in hunting and target shooting. A number of companies, among them Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company and C. Sharps Arms Co. Inc., both of Big Timber, Montana, and the Italian gunmaker Davide Pedersoli &amp; Co. of Brescia, offer a line of Sharps reproductions.

The Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company had manufactured bicycles under contract for Weed Sewing Machine Company in Hartford. When Sharps relocated to Bridgeport, the Weed Sewing Machine Company bought the old Hartford plant to manufacture bicycles themselves.
