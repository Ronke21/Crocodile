<text>The Pacific Electric Railway Company, nicknamed the Red Cars, was a privately owned mass transit system in Southern California consisting of electrically powered streetcars, interurban cars, and buses and was the largest electric railway system in the world in the 1920s. Organized around the city centers of Los Angeles and San Bernardino, it connected cities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County and Riverside County.

The system shared dual gauge track with the narrow-gauge Los Angeles Railway, &quot;Yellow Car,&quot; or &quot;LARy&quot; system on Main Street in downtown Los Angeles (directly in front of the 6th and Main terminal), on 4th Street, and along Hawthorne Boulevard south of downtown Los Angeles toward the cities of Hawthorne, Gardena, and Torrance.

== Districts ==

The system had four districts:
* Northern District: San Gabriel Valley, including Pasadena, Mount Lowe, South Pasadena, Alhambra, El Monte, Covina, Duarte, Glendora, Azusa, Sierra Madre, and Monrovia.
* Eastern District: Pomona, San Bernardino, Arrowhead Springs, Riverside, Rialto and Redlands in the Inland Empire.
* Southern District: Long Beach, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, San Pedro via Dominguez, Santa Ana, El Segundo, Redondo Beach via Gardena, and San Pedro Via Torrance.
* Western District: Hollywood, Glendale/Burbank, San Fernando Valley, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Manhattan/Redondo/Hermosa Beaches, Venice, Playa Del Rey.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Electric trolleys first appeared in Los Angeles in 1887. In 1895 the Pasadena &amp; Pacific Railway was created from a merger of the Pasadena and Los Angeles Railway and the Los Angeles Pacific Railway (to Santa Monica.) The Pasadena &amp; Pacific Railway boosted Southern California tourism, living up to its motto &quot;from the mountains to the sea.&quot;


The Pacific Electric Railway was created in 1901 by railroad executive Henry E. Huntington and banker Isaias W. Hellman. As a Vice President of the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), operated by his uncle, Collis P. Huntington, Huntington had a background in electric trolley lines in San Francisco where he oversaw SP&#x27;s effort to consolidate many smaller street railroads into one organized network. Hellman, the President of the Nevada Bank, San Francisco&#x27;s largest, became one of the largest bond holders for these lines and he and the younger Huntington developed a close business relationship. The success of their San Francisco trolley adventure and Hellman&#x27;s experience in financing some early Los Angeles trolley lines led them to invest in the purchase of some existing downtown Los Angeles lines which they began to standardize and organize into one network called the Los Angeles Railway. When his uncle Collis died, Henry lost a boardroom battle for control of the Southern Pacific to Union Pacific President E. H. Harriman. Huntington then decided to focus his energies on Southern California.

In May 1901, Hellman, who had been Southern California&#x27;s leading banker for almost three decades (and owned much property down there), wrote Huntington that &quot;the time is at hand when we should commence building suburban railroads out of the city.&quot; Hellman added that he had already tasked engineer Epes Randolph to survey and lay out the company&#x27;s first line which would be to Long Beach. In that same year, Huntington and Hellman incorporated a new entity, the Pacific Electric Railway of California, formed to construct new electric rail lines to connect Los Angeles with surrounding cities. Hellman and his group of investors owned the controlling majority of stock (double that of Huntington&#x27;s) and the newspapers of the time referred to it as the Huntington-Hellman syndicate. Using surrogates, the syndicate began purchasing property and rights-of-way. The company&#x27;s first main project, the line to Long Beach, opened July 4, 1902.

Huntington experienced periods of opposition from organized labor with the construction of the new railways. Tensions between union leaders and like-minded Los Angeles businessmen were high from the early 1900s up through the 1920s. Strikes and boycotts troubled the Pacific Electric throughout those years until they reached the height of violence in the 1919 Streetcar Strike of Los Angeles. The efforts of organized labor simmered with the onset of World War I.

Railroads were one part of the enterprise. Revenue from passenger traffic rarely generated a profit, unlike freight. The real money for the investors was in supplying electric power to new communities and in developing and selling real estate. To get the railways and electricity to their towns, local groups offered the Huntington interest opportunities in local land. Soon Huntington and his partners had significant holdings in the land companies developing Naples, Bay City (Seal Beach), Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Redondo Beach.
Harriman, who controlled the powerful Southern Pacific Railroad, was concerned with the competition that these new electric lines gave his steam railroad traffic, and had been prodding Huntington for joint ownership of the lines but Huntington refused to negotiate. In early 1903, Harriman proposed a franchise plan with three-cent fare plan to the Los Angeles City Council, a plan which, if accepted, would have handicapped the other railways severely. Huntington countered with a ticket book which gave the rider of travel for $6.25 (), which undercut the Harriman strategy. The Council vetoed the franchise idea, unable to believe adequate service could be provided for such a low fare. Then, on April 14, 1903, Harriman bought Hook&#x27;s Los Angeles Traction Company, which ran lines within the downtown area and, through its California Pacific subsidiary, was constructing a line from Los Angeles to San Pedro.

The final confrontation came over a bidding war for the 6th Street franchise, in which the franchise (thought to be worth maybe $10,000), finally went to the top bidder for $110,000 (equivalent to $ in ), with Harriman the secret winner. In May 1903, Huntington made an overnight trip to San Francisco and worked out an arrangement with Harriman. The Pacific Electric would get the Los Angeles Traction Lines, SP&#x27;s San Gabriel Valley Rapid Transit Railway line, the 6th Street franchise, and some downtown trackage. In return, Harriman got 40.3% of PE stock, an amount equal to Huntington&#x27;s, with Hellman, Borel and De Guigne owning the remaining 20%. Huntington could expand the PE as he saw fit, but he was not to compete with existing SP lines. A byproduct of this sale was that Harriman sold the banking unit of his Wells Fargo Company to Hellman who merged it with his Nevada Bank operations and established the Pacific Coast&#x27;s largest, most powerful bank.

=== Construction ===
On June 6, 1903, Huntington created the Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway, capitalized at $10 million (equivalent to $ in ), with plans to extend lines to Santa Ana, Newport Beach, the San Fernando Valley, La Habra, Redlands and Riverside, with branches to Colton and San Bernardino. He simultaneously created the Los Angeles Land Company. Huntington owned almost all the stock in the companies, with token amounts allotted to company directors. Although the company allowed Huntington to proceed with construction plans unencumbered by outside interference, the poor state of the bond market meant that he had to turn to stockholders to finance expansion. In 1904 he acquired and finished the Los Angeles and Glendale Railway. In June, LAIU assumed control of the Riverside and Arlington Railway and the Santa Ana and Orange Motor Railway, and soon after, PE and LAIU finished their extension to Huntington Beach and began building a line to Covina.

Huntington continued to expand and not declare profits. On December 7, 1904, the Hellman group sold the rest of their shares and bonds in PE and LAIU to Huntington and Harriman for $1.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). Huntington and Harriman were now equal partners in ownership of the Pacific Electric. The Hellman syndicate retained their 45% interest in the Los Angeles Railway, which they thought would eventually declare dividends. 

By 1905, the Newport and Santa Ana lines were completed. In 1906, the Newport line was extended to Balboa, and in late 1906, lines to Sierra Madre and Oak Knoll in Pasadena were finished. The two firms controlled of track, with the Pacific Electric at and the LAIU, . Huntington purchased the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway in July 1905, along with the Redondo Land Company, which owned 90% of the land in the beach community. This announcement precipitated a land boom in the area which resulted in a quick return of Huntington&#x27;s entire investment in the area and in the railway. 

On March 19, 1906, an agreement was reached to sell control of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad lines, owned by Moses Sherman and Eli P. Clark, for a reported $6 million to Harriman (equivalent to $ in ); this turned over all the lines in downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica and down the coast to Redondo Beach to the Southern Pacific. In January 1907, the Hellman syndicate, after seeing that Huntington ran the Los Angeles Railway similarly to PE, continually expanding and not declaring dividends, sold their 45% stake in the Los Angeles Railway to Harriman and the Southern Pacific.

The Covina line was completed in 1907, as well as a line from Monrovia to Glendora. The system reached La Habra in 1908. By 1910 PE operated nearly of track. Routes had been built into or passed through areas just beginning to grow.

1905 was the Pacific Electric&#x27;s most profitable year, when the road made $90,711 (equivalent to $ in ). Profits from the Huntington Land and Improvement Company made up for the poor earnings of the interurban system, with profits of $151,000 in 1905 rising to $402,000 in 1907 (equivalent to $ and $ in ). However, in 1909, earnings were only $75,000.

Huntington had begun long negotiations with Harriman about consolidating the Los Angeles electric railways beginning in 1907. There had always been a difference between the two men as to the purpose of the railway, with Huntington seeing the PE as a means to facilitate his real estate efforts, and Harriman seeing it as part of the Southern Pacific&#x27;s overall transportation system in Southern California. Harriman left Huntington alone until 1910, when the former refused to allow the latter to run a line to San Diego that would have interfered with a competitive arrangement Harriman had worked out with the Santa Fe Railway.

In July 1908, Huntington leased all the lines of the Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway to Harriman. In 1909 he sold the systems in Fresno and Santa Clara County to the Southern Pacific. Talks paused after the death of Harriman on September 9, 1909, but resumed in early 1910. On September 27, 1910, Huntington and Southern Pacific management came to a final agreement. In a complicated stock and bond transaction, Huntington conveyed his 50% of Pacific Electric to the Southern Pacific, while he acquired SP&#x27;s 45% interest in the Los Angeles Railway. In addition, Huntington conveyed the Los Angeles and Redondo Railway to the Southern Pacific. Huntington retained control of the Los Angeles Railway, the narrow-gauge street car system known locally as &quot;Yellow Cars,&quot; until a controlling interest in this company was sold off by Huntington&#x27;s estate in 1944.

=== The Great Merger and the &quot;New&quot; Pacific Electric ===

In what was called the &quot;Great Merger&quot; of September 1, 1911, the Southern Pacific created a new Pacific Electric Railway Company, with all electrical operations now under the Pacific Electric name. The constituent railroads were:

* Original &quot;old&quot; PE owned by Huntington
* Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway
* Los Angeles Pacific Railway
* Los Angeles and Redondo Railway
* San Bernardino Valley Traction Company
* San Bernardino Interurban Railway
* Redlands Central Railway Company
* Riverside and Arlington Railway Company

Following these acquisitions, PE was the largest operator of interurban electric railway passenger service in the world, with 2,160 daily trains over of track. It operated to many destinations in Southern California, particularly to the south and east.

The Southern Pacific now began to emphasize freight operations. From 1911, when revenue from freight was $519,226 ($ adjusted for inflation), freight revenue climbed to $1,203,956 in 1915 (equivalent to $ in ), 13% of total revenue.

During the 1920s profits were good and the lines were extended to the Pasadena area, to the beaches at Santa Monica, Del Rey, Manhattan/Redondo/Hermosa Beach and Long Beach in Los Angeles County, and to Newport Beach and Huntington Beach in Orange County. Extra service beyond the normal schedules was provided on weekends, particularly in the late afternoon when passengers wanted to return simultaneously. Comedian Harold Lloyd highlighted the popularity and utility of the system in an extended sequence in his 1924 film &quot;Girl Shy&quot;, where, after finding one Red Car too crowded, he commandeered another and drove at high speed through the streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.

In response to a proposal to establish the first bus company in Los Angeles by William Gibbs McAdoo, Pacific Electric and the Los Angeles Railway proposed their own system, the Los Angeles Motor Bus Company. A public referendum chose the latter in May 1923. The first service began in August 1923, and by 1925 had 53 miles of bus routes, the second-most in the nation after Chicago.

PE operated frequent freight trains under electric power throughout its service area (as far as ) to Redlands, including operating electrically powered Railway Post Office routes, one of the few U.S. interurbans to do so. This provided important revenue. The PE was responsible for an innovation in grade crossing safety: the automatic electromechanical grade crossing signal, nicknamed the wigwag. This device was quickly adopted by other railroads. A few wigwags continue in operation .
During this period, the Los Angeles Railway provided local streetcar service in central Los Angeles and to nearby communities. These trolleys were known as the &quot;Yellow Cars&quot; and carried more passengers than the PE&#x27;s &quot;Red Cars&quot; since they ran in the most densely populated portions of Los Angeles, including south to Hawthorne and along Pico Boulevard to near West Los Angeles to terminate at the huge Sears Roebuck store and distribution center (the L.A. Railway&#x27;s most popular line, the &quot;P&quot; line). The Yellow Cars&#x27; unusual narrow-gauge PCC streetcars, by now painted MTA two-tone green, continued to operate until the end of rail service in 1963.

Large profits from land development were generated along the routes of the new lines. Huntington Beach was incorporated in 1909 and developed by the Huntington Beach Company, a real-estate development firm owned by Henry Huntington, which still owns both land in the city and most of the mineral rights.

There are other local streetcar suburbs. Angelino Heights was built around the Temple Street horsecar, which was later upgraded to electric streetcar as part of the Yellow Car system. Highland Park was developed along the Figueroa Street trolley lines and railroads linking downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. Huntington owned nearly all the stock in the Pacific Electric Land Company. West Hollywood was established by Moses Sherman and his partners of the Los Angeles and Pacific Railway. Moses Sherman, Harry Chandler, Hobart Johnstone Whitley, and others bought the entire southern San Fernando Valley in 1910. The electric railway and a $500,000 boulevard called Sherman Way connected the three townsites they were selling. These included Van Nuys, Marion (now Reseda), and Owensmouth (now Canoga Park). Parts of Sherman Way are now called Chandler Boulevard and Van Nuys Boulevard.

The railway company &quot;connected all the dots on the map and was a leading player itself in developing all the real estate that lay in between the dots&quot;.

=== Decline ===

Huntington&#x27;s involvement with urban rail was intimately tied to his real estate development operations. Real estate development was so lucrative for Huntington and SP that they could use the Red Car as a loss leader. However, by 1920, when most of the company&#x27;s holdings had been developed, their major income source began to deplete. Many rural passenger lines were unprofitable, with losses offset by revenue generated from passenger lines in populated corridors and from freight operations. The least-used Red Car lines were converted to cheaper bus routes as early as 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curb 2017/9/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Pacific Electric acquired the Motor Transit Company, which operated intercity bus service within Southern California.

In the pre-automobile era, electric interurban rail was the most economical way to connect outlying suburban and exurban parcels to central cities.

Although the railway owned extensive private roadbeds, usually between urban areas, much PE trackage in urban areas such as downtown Los Angeles west of the Los Angeles River was in streets shared with automobiles and trucks. Virtually all street crossings were at-grade, and increasing automobile traffic led to decreasing Red Car speeds on much of its trackage. At its nadir, the busy Santa Monica Boulevard line, which connected Los Angeles to Hollywood and on to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, had an average speed of 

Traffic congestion was of such great concern by the late 1930s that the influential Automobile Club of Southern California engineered an elaborate plan to create an elevated freeway-type Motorway System, a key aspect of which was the dismantling of the streetcar lines, replacing them with buses that could run on both local streets and on the new express roads.

When the freeway system was planned in the 1930s the city planners planned to include interurban tracks in the center margin of each freeway but the plan was never implemented. There was one exception that was within the Hollywood Freeway through Cahuenga Pass. The San Fernando Valley line from Hollywood took to the center of the Freeway over the pass and exited at Lankershim Boulevard. When that service was terminated, the freeway was expanded onto the former PE roadbed.

The Whittier &amp; Fullerton line was cut in 1938, Redondo Beach, Newport Beach, Sawtelle via San Vicente, and Riverside in 1940. When the San Bernardino Freeway opened in 1941 but was not yet connected to the Hollywood Freeway, while the &quot;Four Way&quot; overpass was being constructed, westbound car traffic from the SB freeway poured onto downtown streets near the present Union Station. PE&#x27;s multiple car trains coming and going from Pasadena, Sierra Madre, and Monrovia/Glendora used those same streets the final few miles from private right-of-way to reach the 6th and Main PE terminal and were bogged down within this jammed traffic. Schedules could not be met, plus former patrons were now driving. The San Bernardino line, Pomona branch, Temple City branch via Alhambra&#x27;s Main Street, San Bernardino&#x27;s Mountain View local to 34th Street, Santa Monica Boulevard via Beverly Hills, and all remaining Pasadena local services were all cut in 1941. Permission was received in September 1942 to abandon the shuttle line to General Hospital which company officials said had been operating at a loss for several months.

The Glendale line survived to the early 1950s due to the convenience of a subway into downtown Los Angeles and used the company&#x27;s only modern equipment, a group of streamlined PCC cars. In 1940, Pacific Electric sold its Glendale, Burbank, and Pasadena operations to Pacific City Lines. San Bernardino operations were sold to San Bernardino Valley Transit.

PE carried increased passenger loads during World War II, when Los Angeles County&#x27;s population nearly doubled as war industries concentrated in the region attracting millions of workers. There were several years when the company&#x27;s income statement showed a profit when gasoline and rubber were rationed and much of the populace depended on mass transit. At peak operation toward the end of the war, the PE dispatched over 10,000 trains daily and was a major employer in Southern California. However, the equipment in use was old and suffered from deferred maintenance.

The nation&#x27;s last interurban Railroad post office (RPO) service was operated by PE on its San Bernardino Line. This was inaugurated comparatively late, on September 2, 1947. It left LA&#x27;s new Union Station interurban yard on the west side of the terminal, turned north onto Alameda Street at 12:45 pm and reached San Bernardino at 4:40 pm, taking three hours for the trip while making postal stops en route as required. It did not operate on Sundays or holidays. This last RPO was pulled off May 6, 1950.

Aware that most new arrivals planned to stay in the region after the war, local municipal governments, Los Angeles County and the state agreed that a massive infrastructure improvement program was necessary. At that time politicians agreed to construct a web of freeways across the region. This was seen as a better solution than a new mass transit system or an upgrade of the PE.

=== Freeway construction ===

Large-scale land acquisition for new freeway construction began in earnest in 1951. The original four freeways of the area, the Hollywood, Arroyo Seco (formerly Pasadena), Harbor, and San Bernardino, were in use or being completed. Partial completion of the San Bernardino Freeway to Aliso Street near downtown Los Angeles led to traffic chaos when inbound automobiles left the freeway and entered city streets.

The Southern District&#x27;s passenger service to Santa Ana and Baldwin Park ended in 1950 as did the Northern District&#x27;s Pasadena&#x27;s Oak Knoll line, and the Sierra Madre line. The Western District&#x27;s last line to Venice and Santa Monica also ended. The Pasadena and Monrovia/Glendora lines ended in 1951.

The various public agencies—city, county, and state—agreed with PE that further abandoning service was necessary and PE happily complied. PE management had earlier compared costs of refurbishing the Northern District interurban lines to Pasadena, Monrovia/Glendora, and Baldwin Park versus the alternative of converting to buses, and found in favor of the latter.

Remaining PE passenger service was sold off in 1953 to Metropolitan Coach Lines, which was given two years of rent-free usage of rail facilities. Jesse Haugh, of Metropolitan Coach Lines, was a former executive of Pacific City Lines which together with National City Lines acquired local streetcar systems across the country with the intention of shutting them down and converting them to bus operation in what became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal.

Several lines operating to the north and the west which used the Belmont Tunnel from the Subway Terminal Building downtown ceased operation – the Hollywood Boulevard and Beverly Hills lines were shut down in 1954 and service to the San Fernando Valley, Burbank and Glendale using newly acquired PCC streetcars lasted only to 1955. The Bellflower line to the south closed in 1958 as the Golden State/Santa Ana (Interstate 5) neared completion.

=== Public ownership ===
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority was established in 1951 to study the possibility of establishing a publicly owned monorail line running north from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles and then west to Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley. In 1954, the agency&#x27;s powers were expanded to allow it to propose a more extensive regional mass-transit system. In 1957, it was given the authority to operate transit lines.

In 1958, the California state government through its Public Utility Commission took over the remaining and most popular lines from Metropolitan Coach Lines. The MTA also purchased the remaining streetcar &quot;Yellow Car&quot; lines of the successor of the Los Angeles Railway, then called Los Angeles Transit Lines. LARy/LATL had been purchased from the Huntington estate by National City Lines in 1945. The MTA started operating all lines as a single system on March 3, 1958.

The Los Angeles-to-Long Beach passenger rail line served the longest, from July 4, 1902, until April 9, 1961. It was both the first and last interurban passenger line of the former Pacific Electric system. It was replaced by the Motor Coach 36f (&quot;F&quot; representing Freeway Flyer) route. The line, which used long stretches of open country running on private right-of-way, was later utilized when the Southern California RTD was designing and building the Metro Blue Line light rail line. The Blue Line, the first modern mass transit line in Los Angeles since the discontinuation of the Red Car service, was first opened in 1990.

The few remaining trolley-coach routes and narrow-gauge streetcar routes of the former Los Angeles Railway &quot;Yellow Cars&quot; were removed in early 1963. The public transportation system continued to be operated by the Los Angeles MTA until the agency was reorganized and relaunched as the Southern California Rapid Transit District in September 1964.

The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the merger of Pacific Electric into the Southern Pacific Railroad on August 12, 1965. Prior to the merger, PE&#x27;s lucrative freight service had been by Southern Pacific diesel-electric locomotives on the heavy-duty PE rail-bed and rails and tripping the &quot;Wig-Wag&quot; crossing signals.

A Christmas tree lot was operated in the small stub yard at the northwest corner of Willow Street and Long Beach Boulevard – the stock arrived in and was stored in a steel sided box car until the Christmas trees were prepared for sale – the busy intersection was where dual trackage departed Long Beach Boulevard and joined the private right-of-way from Huntington Beach and Seal Beach towards Los Angeles. The crossing signal there was the first installation of the final design of the Magnetic Watchman wigwag crossing signal and crossbucks. Oil tank cars were still shuttled to Signal Hill even as the surface street tracks were torn up from the center of Long Beach Boulevard long after the copper overhead catenary supply wires had been removed. Southern Pacific (now part of Union Pacific) continues to operate freight service utilizing former PE right-of-way.

== Post-closure ==
=== Successors ===
During the 1970s, there was serious discussion about the need for additional mass transit systems based on environmental concerns, increasing population and the 1973 oil crisis. A 1974 inquiry in the Senate heard allegations about the role that General Motors and other companies, including Pacific City Lines, played in the dismantlement of streetcar systems across the United States and in particular in Los Angeles, in what became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal. The plot of the 1988 movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; is loosely modeled on the alleged conspiracy to dismantle the streetcar lines in Los Angeles.

In 1976, the state of California formed the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to coordinate the Southern California Rapid Transit District&#x27;s (SCRTD, advertised and known locally by Angelenos as the RTD) efforts with those of various municipal transit systems in the area and to take over planning of countywide transportation systems. The SCRTD continued planning of the Metro subway (the Red Line), while the LACTC developed plans for the light rail system. Caltrans surveyed the condition of former Pacific Electric lines in 1982. Construction began in 1985. In 1988, the two agencies formed a third entity under which all rail construction would be consolidated, and in 1993, the SCRTD and the LACTC were merged into the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA).
When the Metro Blue Line commenced commuter service in 1990 from downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, electric rail passenger train service returned to Los Angeles, using much of the PE roadbed that ceased in 1965. Since then, the LACMTA has opened additional lines.

The Metro Red Line subway opened next in three parts between 1993 and 2000, first from Union Station in central Los Angeles connecting with short subway which forms the northern terminus of Metro Blue Line at 7th/Figueroa Metro Center station, and then west under Wilshire Boulevard onward to Western Avenue. Construction was halted in 1985 due to an unrelated explosion of methane fumes in an underground portion of a Ross Dress for Less store along the proposed route turning north at Fairfax Avenue to Hollywood, which was to service the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum Row and the La Brea Tar Pits. After then-Congressman Henry Waxman banned federal funding for subway construction underneath Wilshire Boulevard past Western Avenue, the subway had to be re-routed. The second portion was the result of this: the subway now traveled north under Vermont Avenue to Hollywood Boulevard turning west to Highland Avenue. When the Hollywood Freeway was built, two PE tracks remained in the center, entering the canyon to Cahuenga Pass under the freeway at what is now the northbound Highland Avenue onramp. PE trackage continued to provide mass transit efficiently until the line was abandoned; the former roadbed was eventually converted for highway use. RTD bus service replaced rail service and remained the highest daily passenger volume corridor. When the third expansion of the Red Line subway opened, most long-distance commuter bus routes from Downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley were trimmed to connect with the new subway stations, reducing diesel fumes and motor vehicle congestion. At the northernmost Metro Red Line terminus, North Hollywood, connections can be made to several MTA bus routes of the San Fernando Valley, including several routes along the private right-of-way Metro Rapidway Metro Orange Line (route 901) dedicated exclusively for MTA vehicles that replicates many PE thru lines by transferring buses.

The Metro Green Line opened in 1995. Its right-of-way was planned from inception to be entirely isolated and protected, running in the median of Interstate 105, the Century Freeway west from Norwalk, connecting at Rosa Parks Station with Metro Blue Line, then further west to Los Angeles International Airport, and then south on elevated tracks to Redondo Beach. The Century Freeway, named for Century Boulevard the equivalent of 100th Street, was the world&#x27;s first freeway built to bypass and relieve traffic congestion from another freeway – the 91, Artesia Freeway. It reutilized a segment of the West Santa Ana Branch for its part of its route.

The Metro Gold Line opened in 2003, connecting downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena. Mostly at-grade, the line runs along the former Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad (AT&amp;SF) historic &quot;Super Chief&quot; right-of-way, which was converted to dual track overhead electric light rail. California&#x27;s oldest surviving iron railroad bridge, built across the Arroyo Seco (1895), was also included in the conversion. The Gold Line Eastside Extension now connects Union Station, Downtown Los Angeles to East Los Angeles. A second extension extended east from Pasadena, again utilizing the former AT&amp;SF right-of-way in the median of Interstate 210.

Metrolink provides weekday interurban commuters with high speed reversible trains – consisting of Diesel Locomotives hauling double-deck high capacity passenger cars servicing much of Los Angeles County and operating to connections in Ventura County, San Bernardino County, Riverside County, Orange County, and San Diego County as well.

 Waterfront Red Car was a streetcar line connecting the World Cruise Center south to Ports O&#x27; Call and the 22nd Street terminal, where a shuttle bus connected other attractions along the San Pedro waterfront. Two newly constructed Red Car replicas, #500 &amp; #501, provided service along the line on cruise ship arrival/departure days as well as weekends – Friday, Saturday and Sunday. In addition, a restored 1907-vintage Pacific Electric car, No. #1508 originally rebuilt from two wrecks as a unique motor coach, was available for special rail excursions. It began operation as a tourist attraction on July 19, 2003. The last day of service was on September 27, 2015. The Port of Los Angeles financed, constructed and operated the replica equipment on heritage PE track, one of many of its waterfront revival projects. A new pedestrian esplanade featuring public art and fountains, sculpture and fountains was built alongside the track from the World Cruise Center to the Maritime Museum and Fire Boat Station. It connected to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and other San Pedro attractions when using the Waterfront Red Car trolley/shuttle. There were plans to extend the Waterfront Red Car line approximately two more miles south to the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and the tidepools of Cabrillo Beach, which never came to pass. Plans for an extension of the line north into Wilmington to Avalon Boulevard along existing trackage were discussed as a part of the waterfront improvement plan. These same plans led to this line being discontinued in favor of redevelopment. Some transit advocates proposed linking this line to the Metro Blue Line Long Beach terminus, a very intensive and expensive expansion.

The E Line (formerly the Expo Line from 2012–2019) is a 22-mile (35 km) light rail line in Los Angeles County, California, running between Santa Monica to East Los Angeles. It is one of the six lines in the Los Angeles Metro Rail system and is operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).

The western portion of the E line was originally named the Expo Line after Exposition Boulevard, along which it runs for most of its route, the line was renamed the E Line in late 2019, while retaining the aqua-colored line and icons used to designate it on maps. After the Regional Connector opened on June 16, 2023, the original E Line was joined with the Eastside portion of the L Line to create the current extended E Line, which is colored gold on maps.

The K Line is a light rail line running north-south between the Jefferson Park and Westchester neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California, passing through various South Los Angeles neighborhoods and the city of Inglewood. It is one of six lines in the Los Angeles Metro Rail system operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). It was opened on October 7, 2022, making it the system&#x27;s newest line.

The current K Line represents the initial operating segment of the Crenshaw/LAX Line project, which began construction in 2014. A segment connecting to the C Line via a wye is expected to open in 2024; the C and K Lines will be integrated and services realigned at that time. The C Line&#x27;s western terminus will be redirected to LAX/Metro Transit Center station and the K Line extended to Redondo Beach station. A connection to the new LAX Automated People Mover is planned for late 2024.

The Regional Connector Transit Project constructed a 1.9-mile (3.1 km) light rail tunnel for the Los Angeles Metro Rail system in Downtown Los Angeles. It connected the A and E lines with the former L Line. The A and E lines previously both terminated at 7th Street/Metro Center station, while the L Line ran through Little Tokyo/Arts District to either Azusa or East Los Angeles. The project provides a one-seat ride into the core of Downtown for passengers on those lines who previously needed to transfer, thus reducing or altogether eliminating many transfers of passengers traveling across the region via Downtown Los Angeles.

=== Proposed developments ===
More rail lines are in the planning and building stages. Light rail is being designed to connect the city center of San Bernardino with the University of Redlands via the Redlands Subdivision by 2021. It will also be the first line in the country with a zero-emission, battery-operated passenger train.

The &quot;Foothill Extension&quot; of the Gold Line has continued with Phase 2 to extend the service to Montclair. As of March 2020, there was some support for extending the Gold Line to Ontario International Airport, though there are neither plans nor funding for this segment as of 2022. The line opened to Azusa on March 5, 2016. Phase 2B of the Foothill Extension began construction on July 10, 2020.

In 2005, with growing congestion along Wilshire Boulevard to the Westside, then Congressman Henry Waxman introduced legislation to repeal the ban on federal dollars being used for subway tunneling underneath Wilshire Boulevard he had passed 20 years earlier. The ban resulted in the Red Line subway ending at Wilshire and Western Avenue before being re-routed up Vermont Avenue towards the Valley. In 2006, the MTA renamed the line from Union Station to Wilshire/Western the Purple Line to differentiate it from the Red Line, which splits at Wilshire/Vermont. As a result, in May 2012, the MTA approved plans to extend the Purple Line to the west as far as the VA Hospital in Westwood, on an alignment mostly following Wilshire Boulevard, the city&#x27;s most densely populated corridor, as was originally planned in mass transit plans designed as early as the 1920s. In 2005, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa made as one of his most publicized campaign promises a pledge to set the wheels in motion for eventual construction of the &quot;Subway to the Sea&quot; as he called it. Construction finally began in 2014 on the Purple Line Extension, with the first phase to LaCienega Boulevard scheduled for completion in 2023, and full completion to the VA Hospital campus in West Los Angeles projected for the 2030s, though if additional funding can be found, the subway could be completed earlier.

Also under consideration is a new passenger rail line on the abandoned Harbor Subdivision railway corridor, connecting Carson to downtown Los Angeles via Torrance and the LA west side. Connections to the Harbor Subdivision from the World Cruise Center cruise ship terminal in the San Pedro District of Los Angeles Harbor to the Long Beach Transit Mall and the Metro Blue Line are also under evaluation.

The West Santa Ana Branch was acquired by local transit agencies with the intent to reactivate the line for rail transit. The Southeast Gateway Line project aims install a new light rail line to Artesia. On the south end of the line, the Orange County Transportation Authority is constructing the OC Streetcar, a modern streetcar system expected to commence service in August 2025.

== Legacy ==
The Pacific Electric Trail is a rail trail that has been constructed along the former Upland–San Bernardino Line. , approximately 21 miles (33-kilometer) have been completed, from the planned western terminus at Huntington Drive in Claremont to the temporary eastern terminus at Cactus Avenue in Rialto , as well as connection to a rail trail project being planned to run from Claremont to San Dimas.

Plot elements of the 1988 movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; are loosely based on folklore about the decline of streetcars in LA.

A transportation attraction based on the PE, the Red Car Trolley, is located at Disney California Adventure Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. It features two stylized replicas of PE rolling stock and is the first attraction in the park to provide transportation, running from Buena Vista Street to Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! in Hollywood Land, with four stations. Construction began on January 4, 2010, and the attraction opened on June 15, 2012. The Ghost Town &amp; Calico Railroad attraction at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm uses a PE depot formerly located at Hansen station along the ROW in Stanton as the main station building. The building was moved to the theme park in 1952.

The iconic red livery of the Red Cars is also said to be the inspiration for the livery of trains on the Keikyu Railway, a commuter railway out of Tokyo with origins in an interurban line.

<text>A convergent boundary (also known as a destructive boundary) is an area on Earth where two or more lithospheric plates collide. One plate eventually slides beneath the other, a process known as subduction. The subduction zone can be defined by a plane where many earthquakes occur, called the Wadati–Benioff zone. These collisions happen on scales of millions to tens of millions of years and can lead to volcanism, earthquakes, orogenesis, destruction of lithosphere, and deformation. Convergent boundaries occur between oceanic-oceanic lithosphere, oceanic-continental lithosphere, and continental-continental lithosphere. The geologic features related to convergent boundaries vary depending on crust types. 

Plate tectonics is driven by convection cells in the mantle. Convection cells are the result of heat generated by the radioactive decay of elements in the mantle escaping to the surface and the return of cool materials from the surface to the mantle. These convection cells bring hot mantle material to the surface along spreading centers creating new crust. As this new crust is pushed away from the spreading center by the formation of newer crust, it cools, thins, and becomes denser. Subduction begins when this dense crust converges with a less dense crust. The force of gravity helps drive the subducting slab into the mantle. As the relatively cool subducting slab sinks deeper into the mantle, it is heated, causing hydrous minerals to break down. This releases water into the hotter asthenosphere, which leads to partial melting of the asthenosphere and volcanism. Both dehydration and partial melting occur along the isotherm, generally at depths of .

Some lithospheric plates consist of both continental and oceanic lithosphere. In some instances, initial convergence with another plate will destroy oceanic lithosphere, leading to convergence of two continental plates. Neither continental plate will subduct. It is likely that the plate may break along the boundary of continental and oceanic crust. Seismic tomography reveals pieces of lithosphere that have broken off during convergence.

== Subduction zones ==

Subduction zones are areas where one lithospheric plate slides beneath another at a convergent boundary due to lithospheric differences. These plates dip at an average of 45° but can vary. Subduction zones are often marked by an abundance of earthquakes, the result of internal deformation of the plate, convergence with the opposing plate, and bending at the oceanic trench. Earthquakes have been detected to a depth of 670 km (416 mi). The relatively cold and dense subducting plates are pulled into the mantle and help drive mantle convection.

== Oceanic – oceanic convergence ==
In collisions between two oceanic plates, the cooler, denser oceanic lithosphere sinks beneath the warmer, less dense oceanic lithosphere. As the slab sinks deeper into the mantle, it releases water from dehydration of hydrous minerals in the oceanic crust. This water reduces the melting temperature of rocks in the asthenosphere and causes partial melting. Partial melt will travel up through the asthenosphere, eventually, reach the surface, and form volcanic island arcs.

== Continental – oceanic convergence ==
When oceanic lithosphere and continental lithosphere collide, the dense oceanic lithosphere subducts beneath the less dense continental lithosphere. An accretionary wedge forms on the continental crust as deep-sea sediments and oceanic crust are scraped from the oceanic plate. Volcanic arcs form on continental lithosphere as the result of partial melting due to dehydration of the hydrous minerals of the subducting slab.

== Continental – continental convergence ==

Some lithospheric plates consist of both continental and oceanic crust. Subduction initiates as oceanic lithosphere slides beneath continental crust. As the oceanic lithosphere subducts to greater depths, the attached continental crust is pulled closer to the subduction zone. Once the continental lithosphere reaches the subduction zone, subduction processes are altered, since continental lithosphere is more buoyant and resists subduction beneath other continental lithosphere. A small portion of the continental crust may be subducted until the slab breaks, allowing the oceanic lithosphere to continue subducting, hot asthenosphere to rise and fill the void, and the continental lithosphere to rebound. Evidence of this continental rebound includes ultrahigh pressure metamorphic rocks, which form at depths of , that are exposed at the surface. Seismic records have been used to map the torn slabs beneath the Caucasus continental – continental convergence zone, and seismic tomography has mapped detached slabs beneath the Tethyan suture zone (the Alps – Zagros – Himalaya mountain belt).

== Volcanism and volcanic arcs ==
The oceanic crust contains hydrated minerals such as the amphibole and mica groups. During subduction, oceanic lithosphere is heated and metamorphosed, causing breakdown of these hydrous minerals, which releases water into the asthenosphere. The release of water into the asthenosphere leads to partial melting. Partial melting allows the rise of more buoyant, hot material and can lead to volcanism at the surface and emplacement of plutons in the subsurface. These processes which generate magma are not entirely understood.

Where these magmas reach the surface they create volcanic arcs. Volcanic arcs can form as island arc chains or as arcs on continental crust. Three magma series of volcanic rocks are found in association with arcs. The chemically reduced tholeiitic magma series is most characteristic of oceanic volcanic arcs, though this is also found in continental volcanic arcs above rapid subduction (&gt;7 cm/year). This series is relatively low in potassium. The more oxidized calc-alkaline series, which is moderately enriched in potassium and incompatible elements, is characteristic of continental volcanic arcs. The alkaline magma series (highly enriched in potassium) is sometimes present in the deeper continental interior. The shoshonite series, which is extremely high in potassium, is rare but sometimes is found in volcanic arcs. The andesite member of each series is typically most abundant, and the transition from basaltic volcanism of the deep Pacific basin to andesitic volcanism in the surrounding volcanic arcs has been called the andesite line.

== Back-arc basins ==

Back-arc basins form behind a volcanic arc and are associated with extensional tectonics and high heat flow, often being home to seafloor spreading centers. These spreading centers are like mid-ocean ridges, though the magma composition of back-arc basins is generally more varied and contains a higher water content than mid-ocean ridge magmas. Back-arc basins are often characterized by thin, hot lithosphere. Opening of back-arc basins may arise from movement of hot asthenosphere into lithosphere, causing extension.

==Oceanic trenches==

Oceanic trenches are narrow topographic lows that mark convergent boundaries or subduction zones. Oceanic trenches average wide and can be several thousand kilometers long. Oceanic trenches form as a result of bending of the subducting slab. Depth of oceanic trenches seems to be controlled by age of the oceanic lithosphere being subducted. Sediment fill in oceanic trenches varies and generally depends on abundance of sediment input from surrounding areas. An oceanic trench, the Mariana Trench, is the deepest point of the ocean at a depth of approximately .

== Earthquakes and tsunamis ==

Earthquakes are common along convergent boundaries. A region of high earthquake activity, the Wadati–Benioff zone, generally dips 45° and marks the subducting plate. Earthquakes will occur to a depth of along the Wadati-Benioff margin.

Both compressional and extensional forces act along convergent boundaries. On the inner walls of trenches, compressional faulting or reverse faulting occurs due to the relative motion of the two plates. Reverse faulting scrapes off ocean sediment and leads to the formation of an accretionary wedge. Reverse faulting can lead to megathrust earthquakes. Tensional or normal faulting occurs on the outer wall of the trench, likely due to bending of the downgoing slab.

A megathrust earthquake can produce sudden vertical displacement of a large area of ocean floor. This in turn generates a tsunami.

Some of the deadliest natural disasters have occurred due to convergent boundary processes. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami was triggered by a megathrust earthquake along the convergent boundary of the Indian plate and Burma microplate and killed over 200,000 people. The 2011 tsunami off the coast of Japan, which caused 16,000 deaths and did US$360 billion in damage, was caused by a magnitude 9 megathrust earthquake along the convergent boundary of the Eurasian plate and Pacific plate.

== Accretionary wedge ==

Accretionary wedges (also called accretionary prisms) form as sediment is scraped from the subducting lithosphere and emplaced against the overriding lithosphere. These sediments include igneous crust, turbidite sediments, and pelagic sediments. Imbricate thrust faulting along a basal decollement surface occurs in accretionary wedges as forces continue to compress and fault these newly added sediments. The continued faulting of the accretionary wedge leads to overall thickening of the wedge. Seafloor topography plays some role in accretion, especially emplacement of igneous crust.

==Examples==

*The collision between the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate that is forming the Himalayas.
*The collision between the Australian plate and the Pacific plate that formed the Southern Alps in New Zealand
*Subduction of the northern part of the Pacific plate and the NW North American plate that is forming the Aleutian Islands.
*Subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American plate to form the Andes.
*Subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the Australian plate and Tonga plate, forming the complex New Zealand to New Guinea subduction/transform boundaries.
*Collision of the Eurasian plate and the African plate formed the Pontic Mountains in Turkey.
*Subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the Mariana plate formed the Mariana Trench.
*Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North American plate to form the Cascade Range.

<text>Louis Eugène Félix Néel (; 22 November 1904 – 17 November 2000) was a French physicist born in Lyon who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1970 for his studies of the magnetic properties of solids.

==Biography==
Néel studied at the Lycée du Parc in Lyon and was accepted at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He obtained the degree of Doctor of Science at the University of Strasbourg. He was corecipient (with the Swedish astrophysicist Hannes Alfvén) of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1970 for his pioneering studies of the magnetic properties of solids. His contributions to solid state physics have found numerous useful applications, particularly in the development of improved computer memory units. About 1930 he suggested that a new form of magnetic behavior might exist; called antiferromagnetism, as opposed to ferromagnetism. Above a certain temperature (the Néel temperature) this behaviour stops. Néel pointed out (1948) that materials could also exist showing ferrimagnetism. Néel has also given an explanation of the weak magnetism of certain rocks, making possible the study of the history of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

He is the instigator of the Polygone Scientifique in Grenoble.

The Louis Néel Medal, awarded annually by the European Geophysical Society, is named in Néel&#x27;s honour.

Néel died at Brive-la-Gaillarde on 17 November 2000 at the age 95, just 5 days short of his 96th birthday.

<text>In planetary science, planetary differentiation is the process by which the chemical elements of a planetary body accumulate in different areas of that body, due to their physical or chemical behavior (e.g. density and chemical affinities). The process of planetary differentiation is mediated by partial melting with heat from radioactive isotope decay and planetary accretion. Planetary differentiation has occurred on planets, dwarf planets, the asteroid 4 Vesta, and natural satellites (such as the Moon).

==Physical differentiation==

===Gravitational separation===
High-density materials tend to sink through lighter materials. This tendency is affected by the relative structural strengths, but such strength is reduced at temperatures where both materials are plastic or molten. Iron, the most common element that is likely to form a very dense molten metal phase, tends to congregate towards planetary interiors. With it, many siderophile elements (i.e. materials that readily alloy with iron) also travel downward. However, not all heavy elements make this transition as some chalcophilic heavy elements bind into low-density silicate and oxide compounds, which differentiate in the opposite direction.

The main compositionally differentiated zones in the solid Earth are the very dense iron-rich metallic core, the less dense magnesium-silicate-rich mantle and the relatively thin, light crust composed mainly of silicates of aluminium, sodium, calcium and potassium. Even lighter still are the watery liquid hydrosphere and the gaseous, nitrogen-rich atmosphere.

Lighter materials tend to rise through material with a higher density. A light mineral such as plagioclase would rise. They may take on dome-shaped forms called diapirs when doing so. On Earth, salt domes are salt diapirs in the crust which rise through surrounding rock. Diapirs of molten low-density silicate rocks such as granite are abundant in the Earth&#x27;s upper crust. The hydrated, low-density serpentinite formed by alteration of mantle material at subduction zones can also rise to the surface as diapirs. Other materials do likewise: a low-temperature, near-surface example is provided by mud volcanoes.

==Chemical differentiation==
Although bulk materials differentiate outward or inward according to their density, the elements that are chemically bound in them fractionate according to their chemical affinities, &quot;carried along&quot; by more abundant materials with which they are associated. For instance, although the rare element uranium is very dense as a pure element, it is chemically more compatible as a trace element in the Earth&#x27;s light, silicate-rich crust than in the dense metallic core.

==Heating==
When the Sun ignited in the solar nebula, hydrogen, helium and other volatile materials were evaporated in the region around it. The solar wind and radiation pressure forced these low-density materials away from the Sun. Rocks, and the elements comprising them, were stripped of their early atmospheres, but themselves remained, to accumulate into protoplanets.

Protoplanets had higher concentrations of radioactive elements early in their history, the quantity of which has reduced over time due to radioactive decay. For example, the hafnium-tungsten system demonstrates the decay of two unstable isotopes and possibly forms a timeline for accretion. Heating due to radioactivity, impacts, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being planets. In melted zones, it was possible for denser materials to sink towards the center, while lighter materials rose to the surface. The compositions of some meteorites (achondrites) show that differentiation also took place in some asteroids (e.g. Vesta), that are parental bodies for meteoroids. The short-lived radioactive isotope 26Al was probably the main source of heat. 

When protoplanets accrete more material, the energy of impact causes local heating. In addition to this temporary heating, the gravitational force in a sufficiently large body creates pressures and temperatures which are sufficient to melt some of the materials. This allows chemical reactions and density differences to mix and separate materials, and soft materials to spread out over the surface. Another external heat source is tidal heating. 

On Earth, a large piece of molten iron is sufficiently denser than continental crust material to force its way down through the crust to the mantle. 

In the outer Solar System, a similar process may take place but with lighter materials: they may be hydrocarbons such as methane, water as liquid or ice, or frozen carbon dioxide.

===Fractional melting and crystallization===
Magma in the Earth is produced by partial melting of a source rock, ultimately in the mantle. The melt extracts a large portion of the &quot;incompatible elements&quot; from its source that are not stable in the major minerals. When magma rises above a certain depth the dissolved minerals start to crystallize at particular pressures and temperatures. The resulting solids remove various elements from the melt, and melt is thus depleted of those elements. Study of trace elements in igneous rocks thus gives us information about what source melted by how much to produce a magma, and which minerals have been lost from the melt.

===Thermal diffusion===
When material is unevenly heated, lighter material migrates toward hotter zones and heavier material migrates towards colder areas, which is known as thermophoresis, thermomigration, or the Soret effect. This process can affect differentiation in magma chambers. A deeper understanding of this process can be drawn back to a study done on the Hawaiian lava lakes. The drilling of these lakes led to the discovery of crystals formed within magma fronts. The magma containing concentrations of these large crystals or phenocrysts demonstrated differentiation through the chemical melt of crystals.

== Lunar KREEP ==
On the Moon, a distinctive basaltic material has been found that is high in &quot;incompatible elements&quot; such as potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus and is often referred to by the abbreviation KREEP. It is also high in uranium and thorium. These elements are excluded from the major minerals of the lunar crust which crystallized out from its primeval magma ocean, and the KREEP basalt may have been trapped as a chemical differentiate between the crust and the mantle, with occasional eruptions to the surface. 

===Differentiation through collision===
Earth&#x27;s Moon probably formed out of material splashed into orbit by the impact of a large body into the early Earth. Differentiation on Earth had probably already separated many lighter materials toward the surface, so that the impact removed a disproportionate amount of silicate material from Earth, and left the majority of the dense metal behind. The Moon&#x27;s density is substantially less than that of Earth, due to its lack of a large iron core. On Earth, physical and chemical differentiation processes led to a crustal density of approximately 2700 kg/m3 compared to the 3400 kg/m3 density of the compositionally different mantle just below, and the average density of the planet as a whole is 5515 kg/m3.

==Core formation mechanisms==
Core formation utilizes several mechanisms in order to control the movement of metals into the interior of a planetary body. Examples include percolation, diking, diapirism, and the direct delivery of impacts are mechanisms involved in this process. The metal to silicate density difference causes percolation or the movement of a metal downward. Diking is a process in which a new rock formation forms within a fracture of a pre-existing rock body. For example, if minerals are cold and brittle, transport can occur through fluid cracks. A sufficient amount of pressure must be met for a metal to successfully travel through the fracture toughness of the surrounding material. The size of the metal intruding and the viscosity of the surrounding material determines the rate of the sinking process. The direct delivery of impacts occurs when an impactor of similar proportions strikes the target planetary body. During the impact, there is an exchange of pre-existing cores containing metallic material. 

The planetary differentiation event is said to have most likely happened after the accretion process of either the asteroid or a planetary body. Terrestrial bodies and iron meteorites consist of Fe-Ni alloys. The Earth&#x27;s core is primarily composed Fe-Ni alloys. Based on the studies of short lived radionuclides, the results suggest that core formation process occurred during an early stage of the solar system. Siderophile elements such as, sulfur, nickel, and cobalt can dissolve in molten iron; these elements help the differentiation of iron alloys. 

The first stages of accretion set up the groundwork for core formation. First, terrestrial planetary bodies enter a neighboring planet&#x27;s orbit. Next, a collision would take place and the terrestrial body could either grow or shrink. However, in most cases, accretion requires multiple collisions of similar sized objects to have a major difference in the planet&#x27;s growth. Feeding zones and hit and run events are characteristics that can result after accretion.

<text>A News, or Netnews Version A, originally known simply as news, was the first widely distributed program for serving and reading Usenet newsgroups. The program, written at Duke University by Steve Daniel and Tom Truscott, was released on a tape given out at the June 1980 USENIX conference held at the University of Delaware. Steve Daniel from Duke offered a presentation on the then-new Usenet network and invited attendees to join.

Seventh Edition Unix included a &quot;message of the day&quot; facility, which allowed the system operator to cause messages to be displayed to the user at login. A News (so called because each message began with &quot;A&quot; as a marker character) was an expansion of this facility that allowed news messages to be distributed across an arbitrary number of systems using the new uucp service.

In addition to the login display, news articles could be read at any time from the command line. A user could also post new messages to the local machine (by posting to a special default newsgroup called &quot;general&quot;) or queue it for network-wide transmission by placing it in a public group such as &quot;NET.general&quot;.

The software was designed primarily for announcements, so the interface was extremely simple. There were no provisions built in for replying to articles over news (e-mail replies were supported), skipping over messages, or threading. Because the system was designed only with uucp in mind, posters were identified by their uucp &quot;bang path&quot; addresses, a feature that persists (albeit more for identifying servers than users) in modern Usenet. ARPAnet addressing was not supported.

The message format was designed for compactness rather than flexibility, consistent with the slow dialup modems used in 1980. The initial &quot;A&quot; dictated the layout of header and message information, and expansions would require changing the initial character. This scheme was abandoned after A news for the more verbose but expandable format seen .

Because Usenet grew rapidly, the limited capabilities and simplistic article storage scheme (all articles were placed in a single disk directory and there was no facility for expiring old articles) quickly made A News impractical to use. It was largely superseded by B News, although some organizations continued to use it for internal communications for many years. Later modifications did add the ability to process the early B News article format and act on B News control articles.

<text>Rhinoceros () is a play by playwright Eugène Ionesco, written in 1959. The play was included in Martin Esslin&#x27;s study of post-war avant-garde drama &quot;The Theatre of the Absurd&quot;, although scholars have also rejected this label as too interpretatively narrow. Over the course of three acts, the inhabitants of a small, provincial French town turn into rhinoceroses; ultimately the only human who does not succumb to this mass metamorphosis is the central character, Bérenger, a flustered everyman figure who is initially criticized in the play for his drinking, tardiness, and slovenly lifestyle and then, later, for his increasing paranoia and obsession with the rhinoceroses. The play is often read as a response and criticism to the sudden upsurge of Fascism and Nazism during the events preceding World War II, and explores the themes of conformity, culture, fascism, responsibility, logic, mass movements, mob mentality, philosophy and morality.

==Plot==

===Act 1===
The play starts in the town square of a small provincial French village. Two friends meet at a coffee shop: eloquent, intellectual and prideful Jean, and the simple, shy, kind-hearted drunkard Bérenger. They have met to discuss an unspecified but important matter. Rather than talk about it, Jean berates Bérenger for his tardiness and drunkenness, until a rhinoceros rampages across the square, causing a commotion. During the discussion that follows, a second rhinoceros appears and crushes a woman&#x27;s cat. The woman got sad and people tried to help her by giving her a brandy. This generated an outrage and the villagers band together to argue that the presence of the rhinoceroses should not be allowed. A discussion about whether they saw two different rhinoceroses or the same one twice leads to a heated argument between Bérenger and Jean, shouting at the top of their voices, eventually causing Jean to walk away in a huff.

===Act 2===
Bérenger arrives late for work at the local newspaper office. Daisy, the receptionist, with whom Bérenger is in love, covers for him by sneaking him a time sheet. At the office, an argument has broken out between sensitive and logical Dudard and the violent, temperamental Botard. The latter does not believe a rhinoceros could appear in France.

Mrs. Bœuf (the wife of an employee) says that her husband is unwell and that she was chased all the way to the office by a rhinoceros. Botard scoffs at the so-called &quot;rhinoceritis&quot; movement and says that the local people are too intelligent to be swayed by empty rhetoric. A rhinoceros arrives and destroys the staircase that leads out of the office, trapping all the workers inside. Mrs. Bœuf recognizes the rhinoceros as her husband, transformed. Despite a warning, she joins him by jumping down the stairwell onto her husband’s back. Daisy has called the firemen. The office workers escape through a window.

Bérenger visits Jean in order to apologize for the previous day&#x27;s argument. He finds Jean sick and in bed. They argue once more, this time about whether people can transform into rhinoceroses and then about the morality of such a change. Jean is at first against it, then more lenient. Jean begins to gradually transform. Finally, Jean proclaims that they have just as much of a right to life as humans, then says that &quot;Humanism is dead, those who follow it are just old sentimentalists&quot;. After
transforming fully, he chases Bérenger out of the apartment.

===Act 3===
Bérenger is at home having a nightmare. He fears transforming like Jean did earlier. He has a sip of brandy and retires to bed. Dudard visits him and they have nearly the same exchange as with Jean earlier. Only this time, Dudard is accepting of the transformation and Bérenger resists the idea and denies that he will change.

Daisy arrives with a basket of love. Both Dudard and Bérenger desire her. Botard, Daisy reveals, has also changed. Many villagers, including firemen, have begun to transform. Dudard leaves, wanting to see firsthand. Bérenger tries to stop him. Dudard turns into a rhinoceros himself.

Bérenger laments the loss of Dudard. Daisy tells Bérenger that they have no right to interfere in others’ lives. Bérenger says he will defend her. He blames both himself and Daisy for aiding, through lack of sympathy, the transformations of Jean and Papillon, respectively. Daisy allays his guilt.

The phone rings, but they hear only rhino trumpeting on the line. They turn to the radio for help, but the rhinos have taken that over, too. Bérenger professes his love for Daisy. She seems to reciprocate. They attempt to have a normal life amongst beasts. Bérenger suggests that they attempt to repopulate the human race. Daisy begins to move away from him, suggesting that Bérenger does not understand love. She has come to believe the rhinoceroses are truly passionate.

Bérenger slaps Daisy without thinking and then immediately recants. Bérenger exclaims that, &quot;in just a few minutes we have gone through twenty-five years of married life!&quot; They attempt to reconcile, but once more fight. As Bérenger examines himself in a mirror for any evidence of transformation, Daisy slips away to join the animals.

Now alone completely, Bérenger regrets his actions towards Daisy. In his solitude, he begins to doubt his existence. He attempts to change into a rhinoceros but cannot, then regains his determination to fight the beasts, shouting, &quot;I&#x27;m not capitulating!&quot;

== Background and meaning ==

American scholar Anne Quinney argues that the play was autobiographical, and reflected Ionesco&#x27;s own youth in Romania. Ionesco was born in Romania to a Romanian father and French mother. Ionesco&#x27;s father was a Romanian ultra-nationalist of the Orthodox faith with few political scruples, who was willing to support whatever party was in power – while his mother was a French Protestant who came from a family of Sephardic Jews who had converted to Calvinism to better fit into French society. In the increasing antisemitic atmosphere of Romania in the interwar period, being even partly ethnically Jewish was enough to put Ionesco in danger. The Israeli historian Jean Ancel states that the Romanian intelligentsia had a &quot;schizophrenic attitude towards the West and its values,&quot; yet considered the West, especially France, to be their role model. At the same time antisemitism was rampant in Romania. Most Romanian Jews were descendants of Ashkenazi Jews who had moved to Romania in the 18th and 19th centuries from Poland. A recurring claim of the Romanian radical right was that most Romanian Jews were illegal immigrants or had obtained Romanian citizenship fraudulently. In the 19th century, the newly independent Romanian state proved very reluctant to grant citizenship to Romania&#x27;s Jews, and a volatile atmosphere of antisemitism flourished with many intellectuals like A. C. Cuza claiming the Jews were a foreign and alien body in Romania that needed to be removed.

In interwar Romania, the most virulent and violent antisemitic movement was the fascist Iron Guard (formed as the paramilitary branch of the Legion of the Archangel Michael), founded in 1927 by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. As a university student, Ionesco saw one of his professors, Nae Ionescu, who taught philosophy at the University of Bucharest, use his lectures to recruit his students into the Legion. In an interview in 1970, Ionesco explained the play&#x27;s message as an attack on those Romanians who become caught up in the &quot;ideological contagion&quot; of the Legion:
University professors, students, intellectuals were turning Nazi, becoming Iron Guards one after another. We were fifteen people who used to get together, to find arguments, to discuss, to try to find arguments opposing theirs. It was not easy ... From time to time, one of the group would come out and say &#x27;I don&#x27;t agree at all with them, to be sure, but on certain points, I must admit, for example the Jews ...&#x27; And that kind of comment was a symptom. Three weeks later, that person would become a Nazi. He was caught in a mechanism, he accepted everything, he became a Rhinoceros. Towards the end, it was only three or four of us who resisted. In 1936, Ionesco wrote with disgust that the Iron Guard had created &quot;a stupid and horrendously reactionary Romania&quot;.

Romanian university students were disproportionately over-represented in the Iron Guard, a fact which rebuts the claim that the Iron Guard attracted support only from social &quot;losers&quot;. Romania had a very large intelligentsia relative to its share of the population with 2.0 university students per one thousand of the population compared to 1.7 per one thousand of the population in far wealthier Germany, while Bucharest had more lawyers in the 1930s than did the much larger city of Paris. Even before the Great Depression, Romania&#x27;s universities were turning out far more graduates than there were jobs for, and a mood of rage, desperation and frustration prevailed on campuses as it was apparent to most Romanian students that the middle class jobs that they were hoping for after graduation did not exist. In interwar Romania, Jews played much the same role as Greeks and Armenians did in the Ottoman Empire and the ethnic Chinese minorities do in modern Malaysia and Indonesia, namely a commercially successful minority much resented for their success. The Legion&#x27;s call to end the &quot;Jewish colonization&quot; of Romania by expelling all the Jews, who the Legion claimed were all illegal immigrants from Poland, and confiscate their assets so that Christian Romanians could rise up to the middle class, was very attractive to many university students. Codreanu&#x27;s call for a Romania without individualism, where all Romanians would be spiritually united together as one, greatly appealed to the young people who believed that when Codreanu created his &quot;new man&quot; (&quot;omul nou&quot;), it would be the moment that a utopian society would come into existence. Ionesco felt that the way in which so many of his generation, especially university students, had abandoned the French ideas about universal human rights in favor of the death cult of the Legion, was a &quot;betrayal&quot; both personally and in a wider political sense of the sort of society Romania should be. As a young writer and playwright in 1930s Bucharest who associated with many leading figures of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, Ionesco felt more and more out of place as he clung to his humanist values while his friends all joined the Legion, feeling much as Bérenger does by the end of &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; as literally the last human being left on an earth overrun by rhinoceroses. In an interview with a Romanian newspaper shortly before his death in 1994, Ionesco stated how &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; related to his youth in Romania: It is true. I had the experience of an &quot;extrême droite&quot;. And of the second hand left, which had been a radical socialist...Maybe I should have belonged to the left for a while, maybe I should have been of the left before being-not of the right-of the non-left, an enemy of the left. But at a certain moment, the left was no longer the left, at a certain moment the left become a right of horror, a right of terror and that&#x27;s what I was denouncing, the terror.

In &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, all of the characters except Bérenger talk in clichés: for example, when first encountering the rhinoceros, all of the characters apart from Bérenger insipidly exclaim &quot;Well, of all things!&quot;, a phrase that occurs in the play twenty-six times. Ionesco was suggesting that by vacuously repeating clichés instead of meaningful communication, his characters had lost their ability to think critically, and were thus already partly rhinoceros. Likewise, once a character repeats a platitudinous expression such as &quot;It&#x27;s never too late!&quot; (repeated twenty-two times in the play) or &quot;Come on, exercise your mind. Concentrate!&quot; (repeated twenty times), the other characters start to mindlessly repeat them, which further shows their herd mentality. In the first act, the character of the logician says: &quot;I am going to explain to you what a syllogism is ... The syllogism consists of a main proposition, a secondary one and a conclusion&quot;. The logician gives the example of: &quot;The cat has four paws. Isidore and Fricot have four paws. Therefore, Isidore and Fricot are cats&quot;. Quinney sums up the logician&#x27;s thinking as: &quot;The logic of this reasoning would allow any conclusion to be true based on two premises, the first of which contains the term that is the predicate of the conclusion and the second of which contains the term that is the subject of the conclusion&quot;. Based on this way of thinking as taught by the logician, the character of the old man is able to conclude that his dog is in fact a cat, leading him to proclaim: &quot;Logic is a very beautiful thing&quot;, to which the logician replies &quot;As long as it is not abused&quot;. It is at this moment that the first rhinoceros appears. One of the leading Romanian intellectuals in the 1930s who became close to the Iron Guard was Emil Cioran, who in 1952 published in Paris a book entitled &quot;Syllogismes d&#x27;amertume&quot;. Emil Cioran severed his friendship with Ionesco, an experience that very much hurt the latter. The character of the logician with his obsession with syllogisms and a world of pure reason divorced from emotion is a caricature of Cioran, a man who claimed that &quot;logic&quot; demanded that Romania have no Jews. More broadly, Ionesco was denouncing those whose rigid ways of thinking stripped of any sort of humanist element led them to inhumane and/or inane views.

In the first act of the play, the characters spend much time debating whether the rhinoceroses that have mysteriously appeared in France are African or Asian rhinoceroses, and which of the two types were superior to the other – a debate that Ionesco meant to be a satire on racism. Regardless of whether the rhinoceros are African or Asian, the French characters comfortably assume their superiority to the rhinoceros; ironically the same people all become rhinoceroses themselves. Bérenger&#x27;s friend Jean judges the superiority of African vs. Asian rhinoceroses by their number of horns (making him a caricature of those people who judge other people by the color of their skin) and at one point shouts at Bérenger: &quot;If anybody&#x27;s got horns, it is you! You are an Asiatic Mongol!&quot; A recurring theme in Nazi propaganda was that the Jews were an &quot;Asiatic&quot; people who were unfortunately living in Europe, a message that many of the French became familiar with during the German occupation of 1940–1944. Ionesco alludes to the atmosphere of that period in his depiction of Jean taunting Bérenger over his supposed horns, and being &quot;Asiatic&quot;. Ionesco intended the character of Jean, an ambitious functionary whose careerism robs him of the ability to think critically, to be a satirical portrayal of the French civil servants who served the Vichy government. At various points in the play, Jean shouts out such lines as &quot;We need to go beyond moral standards!&quot;, &quot;Nature has its own laws. Morality against Nature!&quot; and &quot;We must go back to primeval integrity!&quot; When Jean says &quot;humanism is all washed up&quot;, Bérenger asks: &quot;Are you suggesting we replace our moral laws with the law of the jungle?&quot;

Lines such as these show that Ionesco also created the character of Jean as a satire of the Iron Guard, which attacked all the humanist values of the modern West as &quot;Jewish inventions&quot; designed to destroy Romania, and claimed that there was a &quot;natural law&quot; in which &quot;true&quot; Romanians would discover their &quot;primal energy&quot; as the purest segment of the &quot;Latin race&quot; and assert their superiority over the &quot;lower races&quot;. Notably, the more Jean rants about &quot;natural laws&quot; trumping all, the more he transforms into a rhinoceros.

When Romanian nationalism first emerged in the late 18th century – at a time when Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and Bukovina of the Austrian Empire, while the Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and the Dobruja were ruled by the Ottoman Empire – there was an intense emphasis on the Latinity of the Romanians, who were depicted as a lonely island of Latin civilization in Eastern Europe surrounded by &quot;Slavic and Turanian barbarians&quot;. The reference to &quot;Turanian barbarians&quot; was to both the Turks and the Magyars who both &quot;Turanian&quot; peoples from Asia. This tradition of seeing Romania as a bastion of Latinism threatened by enemies everywhere culminated in the 1930s where the Iron Guard argued there were &quot;natural laws&quot; that determined Romania&#x27;s struggle for existence, which allowed the Legion to justify any act of violence no matter how amoral as necessary because of the &quot;natural laws&quot;. Ionesco parodied the Legion&#x27;s talk of &quot;natural laws&quot; and &quot;primeval values&quot; by putting dialogue that closely resembled the Legion&#x27;s rhetoric into Jean as he transforms into a green rhinoceros.

At the same time, Ionesco also attacked in &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; the French &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, a disproportionate number of whom were proud members of the French Communist Party in the 1950s. As an anti-Communist Romanian émigré living in France, Ionesco was often offended by the way in which so many French intellectuals embraced Stalinism and would either justify or deny all of the crimes of the Stalin regime under the grounds that the Soviet Union was a &quot;progressive&quot; nation leading humanity to a better future. Ionesco satirized French Communist intellectuals with the character of Botard, who is clearly the most left-wing character in the play. Botard professes himself to be the champion of progressive values, saying about the debate in regards to the debate over the superiority of African vs. Asian rhinoceros that: &quot;The color bar is something I feel strongly about, I hate it!&quot;. But at the same time, Botard shows himself to be rigid, small-minded and petty in his thinking, using Marxist slogans in place of intelligent thought. Most notably, Botard is unable to accept the fact of rhinoceritis despite overwhelming evidence of its existence. For an example, Botard dismisses rhinoceritis as: &quot;An example of collective psychosis, Mr. Dudard. Just like religion-the opiate of the people!&quot;. Despite seeing the rhinoceroses with his own eyes, Botard convinces himself that rhinoceritis is all a gigantic capitalist plot, dismissing rhinoceritis as an &quot;infamous plot&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;. Ionesco created the character of Botard as a caricature of French Communist intellectuals who managed to ignore overwhelming evidence of Stalin&#x27;s terror and proclaimed the Soviet Union to be the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, dismissing any evidence to the contrary as mere anti-Soviet propaganda. A further attack on Communism was provided by the character of the pipe-smoking intellectual Dudard. Ionesco stated in an interview that: &quot;Dudard is Sartre&quot;. Ionesco disliked Jean-Paul Sartre – France&#x27;s most famous intellectual in the 1950s – for the way in which he sought to justify Stalin&#x27;s murderous violence as necessary for the betterment of humanity as a betrayal of everything that a French intellectual should be, and intended the character of Dudard who always finds excuses for the rhinoceros as a caricature of Sartre who always found excuses for Stalin.

Ionesco also intended &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; as a satire of French behavior under the German occupation of 1940–1944. The green skin of the rhinoceros recalled not only the green uniforms of the Iron Guard, but also the green uniforms of the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; who enforced German power in France during the occupation. Several French critics when they saw the première of &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; in 1960 wrote in their reviews that the green skin of the rhinoceros invoked memories of the Occupation, with the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; in their green uniforms and the Wehrmacht in their muddy-green uniforms. During the Occupation, the French applied nicknames to the Germans that often used the word &quot;vert&quot;, calling the Germans &quot;haricots verts&quot; (green beans), &quot;sauterelles vertes&quot; (green locusts), and &quot;race verte&quot; (green race). In France during the occupation, the color green was indelibly associated with the Germans.

For the French people, the defeat of June 1940 came as a very profound shock, something that they could never imagine would actually happen. The experience of the Occupation was a deeply psychologically disorienting one for the French as what was once familiar and safe become strange and threatening. Many Parisians could not get over the shock experienced when they first saw the huge swastika flags hanging over the Hôtel de Ville and on top of the Eiffel Tower. The British historian Ian Ousby wrote:Even today, when people who are not French or did not live through the Occupation look at photos of German soldiers marching down the Champs Élysées or of Gothic-lettered German signposts outside the great landmarks of Paris, they can still feel a slight shock of disbelief. The scenes look not just unreal, but almost deliberately surreal, as if the unexpected conjunction of German and French, French and German, was the result of a Dada prank and not the sober record of history.

This shock is merely a distant echo of what the French underwent in 1940: seeing a familiar landscape transformed by the addition of the unfamiliar, living among everyday sights suddenly made bizarre, no longer feeling at home in places they had known all their lives. Ousby wrote that by the end of summer of 1940: &quot;And so the alien presence, increasingly hated and feared in private, could seem so permanent that, in the public places where daily life went on, it was taken for granted&quot;. At the same time France was also marked by disappearances as buildings were renamed, books banned, art was stolen to be taken to Germany and as time went on, various people, especially Jews were arrested and deported to death camps.

Afterwards, many of the French learned to accept the changes imposed by the German occupation, coming to the conclusion that Germany was Europe&#x27;s dominant power and the best that could be done was to submit and bow down before the might of the &quot;Reich&quot;. The more difficult and dangerous choice of becoming a &quot;résistant&quot; to the German occupation was taken only by a minority of brave people; estimates of those French who served in the Resistance varied from 2%–14% of the population depending on the historian and what one chooses to define as resistance. Many historians argued that such activities like writing for an underground newspaper, sheltering Jews and Allied servicemen, providing intelligence to the Allies or sabotaging the railroads and factories counts as resistance. Only about 2% of the French population or about 400,000 people engaged in armed resistance during the Occupation. In &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;, the characters are shocked and horrified that people are turning into brutal rhinoceros, but during the course of the play learn to accept what is happening, as just the French people were shocked by their defeat in 1940, but many learned to accept their place in the &quot;New Order&quot; in Europe. Dudard expresses collaborationist feelings towards the rhinoceros, saying: &quot;Well, I&#x27;m surprised, too. Or rather I was. Now I am getting used to it&quot;. Dudard also says of the rhinoceros: &quot;They don&#x27;t attack you. If you leave them alone, they just ignore you. You can&#x27;t say they are spiteful&quot;. Dudard&#x27;s statements recall those feelings of the French who were initially shocked to see German soldiers, policemen and the SS marching around their cities and towns in 1940, but swiftly learned that if offered no resistance, the Germans would usually leave them alone to live their lives (provided that they were not Jewish).

Along the same lines, Bérenger wonders &quot;Why us?&quot;, asking how rhinoceritis could possibly be happening in France. Bérenger goes on to say:If only it happened somewhere else, in some other country, and we&#x27;d just read about it in the papers, one could discuss it quietly, examine the question from all points of view and come to an objective conclusion. We could organize debates with professors and writers and lawyers, blue-stockings and artists and people and ordinary men in the street as well—it would be very interesting and instructive. But when you&#x27;re involved yourself, when you suddenly find yourself up against brutal facts, you can&#x27;t help feeling directly concerned—the shock is too violent for you to stay detached. Besides alluding to the German occupation, lines such as these also recall Ionesco&#x27;s youth in Romania in the 1930s. Bérenger, the hard-drinking, slovenly, kindly everyman is regarded as the alter ego of Ionesco.

In an interview, Ionesco said: 
The rhinoceroses, rhinoceritis and rhinoceration are current matters and you single out a disease that was born in this century. Humanity is besieged by certain diseases, physiologically and organically, but the &quot;spirit&quot; too is periodically besieged by certain diseases. You discovered a disease of the 20th century, which could be called after my famous play, rhinoceritis. For a while, one can say that a man is rhinocerised by stupidity or baseness. But there are people—honest and intelligent—who in their turn may suffer the unexpected onset of this disease, even the dear and close ones may suffer...It happened to my friends. That&#x27;s why I left Romania.

Aspects of Bérenger who stubbornly remains human and vows never to give in recall Ionesco&#x27;s own youth in Romania in the shadow of the Iron Guard. Jean and Dudard both mock Bérenger for weakness because he drinks too much and believes in love which they view as signs of lack of self-control, but Ionesco said about Bérenger that the strength of the modern hero &quot;stemmed from what may be taken for weakness&quot;. When Bérenger declares his love for Daisy, it is a sign that he still retains his humanity, despite the way that others mocked him for believing in love. Ionesco wrote during his youth, he had the &quot;strange responsibility&quot; of being himself, feeling like the last (metaphorical) human being in Romania, as &quot;all around me men were metamorphosed into beasts, rhinoceros... You would run into an old friend, and all of sudden, right before your eyes, he would start to change. It was if his gloves had become paws, his shoes hoofs. You could no longer talk intelligently with him for he was not a rational human being&quot;. Quinney noted that in both French and English, the word rhinoceros is both a singular and plural term, and argued that Ionesco made people transform into rhinoceros in his play as indicating that when an individual becomes part of a herd mindlessly following others, such a man or a woman lose part of their humanity.

Ionesco chose to stay in Romania to fight against the &quot;rhinocerisation&quot; of the &quot;intelligentsia&quot;, despite the fact that one by one his friends all become members of the Legion, or refused to talk to him out of cowardice until the regime of General Ion Antonescu passed a law in 1940 that forbade all Jews (defined in racial terms) from participating in the arts in Romania in any way or form. Quinney argued that Ionesco&#x27;s &quot;théâtre de l&#x27;absurde&quot; plays were a form of &quot;lashing out&quot; against his friends who in his youth had abandoned him for the Legion, and reflected his dual identity as both Romanian and French. Quinney maintained that terror felt by Bérenger at being the last human left in the world reflected Ionesco&#x27;s own terror as he saw his friends, caught up in youthful idealism, all become Legionnaires, while the rest were either too cynical or cowardly to resist the Legion. Quinney further argued that literary scholars who have seen Ionesco only as a French playwright and neglected the fact that Ionesco saw himself as both Romanian and French have thus overlooked the fact that &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; was intended as an allegory of and attack on the Legion of the Archangel Michael .

== Productions ==
&quot;Rhinoceros&quot; had its world premiere in Dusseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia on November 1, 1959 at Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus. It was directed by Karl Heinz Stroux and starred Karl-Maria Schley as Bérenger, Joachim Teege as Jean, and Eva Boettcher as Daisy. On its opening night, the theatre gave Ionesco a ten-minute ovation.

On January 25, 1960, the play opened at the Odéon in Paris. It was produced by Jean-Louis Barrault and starred Barrault as Bérenger, William Sabatier as Jean, and Simone Valère as Daisy.

In April 1960, the play was performed by the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre in London, England under the direction of Orson Welles with Laurence Olivier as Bérenger, Joan Plowright as Daisy, and Michael Bates, Miles Malleson and Peter Sallis in the cast. The production moved to the Strand Theatre (now the Novello Theatre) that June. Following the move Dudard and Daisy were played by Michael Gough and Maggie Smith.

In 1961, the American premiere of &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre under the direction of Joseph Anthony. It starred Eli Wallach as Bérenger, Anne Jackson as Daisy, Jean Stapleton as Mrs. Bœuf (Mrs. Ochs in this adaptation), and Zero Mostel, who won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Jean. Wallach was replaced during the run by Alfred Ryder (who also toured with Mostel on the West Coast) and then Ralph Meeker. After Wallach left the show, Mostel took top billing over Ryder and Meeker, all of whom were nonetheless billed above the play&#x27;s title.

In 1996, the play was revived off-Broadway at Theatre Four, which had previously staged the musical revue &quot;Ionescopade&quot;, featuring songs and scenes based on the works of Ionesco. It was produced by Herbert Beigel for the Valiant Theatre Company and directed by Michael Murray. It starred Peter Jacobson as Bérenger, Zach Grenier as Jean (John in this translation), and Geoffrey Owens as Dudard.

The Royal Court Theatre revived the play in 2007 and starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Bérenger and directed by Dominic Cooke.

The Bangalore Little Theatre, in collaboration with the Alliance Française de Bangalore, presented Eugene Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, a play in the Theatre of the Absurd tradition. This adaptation is written by Dr. Vijay Padaki, a veteran in theatre.

In 2016 &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; was adapted and directed by Wesley Savick. It was performed by Modern Theatre in Boston.

In 2023 Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, the Welsh-language National Theatre, toured a new production of &#x27;Rhinoseros&#x27; translated by Manon Steffan Ros and directed by Steffan Donnelly. It starred Rhodri Meilir, Bethan Ellis Owen and Eddie Ladd.

==Adaptations==
Polish graphic designer Jan Lenica adapted the play into a ten-minute animated short film, which is available on YouTube.

The play was adapted to an urban American setting for a 1973 film (also called &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;) directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan and starring Zero Mostel as John (Jean in the play), Gene Wilder as Stanley (Bérenger) and Karen Black as Daisy.

The play was also adapted for a 1990 musical, titled &quot;Born Again&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre, by Peter Hall, Julian Barry and composer Jason Carr. The setting was relocated to an American shopping mall. It starred Mandy Patinkin.

The 2008 comedy horror film &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot; is a loose adaptation of the play, but with zombies instead of rhinoceroses.

==Awards and honors==

===Original Broadway production===
==&quot;Rhinocerization&quot;==
The term Rhinocerization (התקרנפות, hitkarnefut) became colloquial in Israel for getting swayed in a nationalistic fervor, or any other general sentiment. It was originally coined by theatre critic Asher Nahor in his review of the play in 1962, which was played at the Haifa Theatre. However, it seems that popular usage followed only after Amos Oz employed the infinitive verb form (להתקרנף, lehitkarnef) ten years later.

One use of &quot;rhinocerization&quot; was by Israeli historian Jean Ancel to describe how Romanian intellectuals were subsumed by the appeal of the Legion of the Archangel Michael in particular and radical antisemitism in general in his 2002 book &quot;The History of the Holocaust In Romania&quot;.

<doc id="254469" wikidata="Q981086" url="?curid=254469" title="Walter de la Mare">
<text>Walter John de la Mare (; 25 April 1873 – 22 June 1956) was an English poet, short story writer and novelist. He is probably best remembered for his works for children, for his poem &quot;The Listeners&quot;, and for his psychological horror short fiction, including &quot;Seaton&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, &quot;The Green Room&quot; and &quot;All Hallows&quot;. In 1921, his novel &quot;Memoirs of a Midget&quot; won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction, and his post-war &quot;Collected Stories for Children&quot; won the 1947 Carnegie Medal for British children&#x27;s books.

==Life==
De la Mare was born at 83, Maryon Road, Charlton, then in the county of Kent but now part of the Royal Borough of Greenwich. He was partly descended from a family of French Huguenot silk merchants through his father, James Edward de la Mare (1811–1877), a principal at the Bank of England; his mother was James&#x27;s second wife, Lucy Sophia (1838–1920), daughter of a Scottish naval surgeon and author, Dr Colin Arrott Browning. (The suggestion that Lucy was related to the poet Robert Browning has been found to be incorrect.) He had two brothers, Francis Arthur Edward and James Herbert, and four sisters, Florence Mary, Constance Eliza, Ethel (who died in infancy) and Ada Mary. De la Mare preferred to be known as &quot;Jack&quot; to his family and friends, as he disliked the name Walter.

De la Mare was educated at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral School, then worked from 1890 to 1908 in the statistics department of the London office of Standard Oil. He left the company after Sir Henry Newbolt arranged for him to receive a Civil List pension so that he could concentrate on writing.

In 1892 de la Mare joined the Esperanza Amateur Dramatics Club, where he met and fell in love with (Constance) Elfrida Ingpen, the leading lady, who was ten years older than him. Her father, William Alfred Ingpen, was Clerk to the Insolvent Debtors Court and Clerk of the Rules. De la Mare and Elfrida were married on 4 August 1899, and they went on to have four children: Richard Herbert Ingpen, Colin, Florence and Lucy Elfrida. The family lived in Beckenham and Anerley from 1899 till 1924. The home in Anerley in South London was the scene of many parties, notable for imaginative games of charades.

From 1925 to 1939, de la Mare lived at Hill House, Taplow.

On 7 September 1929, his daughter, Janette de la Mare married Donald John Ringwood in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, England.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/3361811&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 Elfrida de la Mare was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She spent the rest of her life as an invalid and died in 1943.

From 1940 until his death de la Mare lived in South End House, Montpelier Row, Twickenham, on the same street on which Alfred, Lord Tennyson, had lived. De la Mare won the annual Carnegie Medal, from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject, for his &quot;Collected Stories for Children&quot; (Faber and Faber, 1947). It was the first collection to win the award.

De la Mare suffered from a coronary thrombosis in 1947 and died of another in 1956. He spent his final year mostly bedridden, being cared for by a nurse whom he loved but never had a physical relationship with. His ashes are buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where he had once been a choirboy.

==Profile==
===&quot;Come Hither&quot;===
&quot;Come Hither&quot; is an anthology edited by de la Mare, mostly of poems, but with some prose. It has a frame story and can be read on several levels. It was first published in 1923 and was a success; further editions have followed. It includes a selection of poems by the leading Georgian poets (from de la Mare&#x27;s perspective).

===Supernaturalism===
De la Mare was, notably, a writer of ghost stories. His collections &quot;Eight Tales&quot;, &quot;The Riddle and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;The Connoisseur and Other Stories&quot;, &quot;On the Edge&quot; and &quot;The Wind Blows Over&quot; each contain several ghost stories.

De la Mare&#x27;s supernatural horror writings were favourites of H. P. Lovecraft, who in his comprehensive study &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; said that &quot;[de la Mare] is able to put into his occasional fear-studies a keen potency which only a rare master can achieve&quot;. Lovecraft singled out for praise de la Mare&#x27;s short stories &quot;Seaton&#x27;s Aunt&quot;, &quot;The Tree&quot;, &quot;Out of the Deep&quot;, &quot;Mr Kempe&quot;, &quot;A Recluse&quot; and &quot;All Hallows&quot;, along with his novel &quot;The Return&quot;.

Gary William Crawford has described de la Mare&#x27;s supernatural fiction for adults as being &quot;among the finest to appear in the first half of this century&quot;, whilst noting the disparity between the high quality and low quantity of de la Mare&#x27;s mature horror stories. Other notable de la Mare ghost/horror stories are &quot;A:B:O&quot;, &quot;Crewe&quot;, &quot;The Green Room&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;.

A number of later writers of supernatural fiction, including Robert Aickman, Ramsey Campbell, David A. McIntee and Reggie Oliver, have cited de la Mare&#x27;s ghost stories as inspirational. The horror scholar S. T. Joshi has said that de la Mare&#x27;s supernatural fiction &quot;should always have an audience that will shudder apprehensively at its horror and be moved to somber reflection by its pensive philosophy&quot;.

===Children&#x27;s literature===
For children de la Mare wrote the fairy tale &quot;The Three Mulla Mulgars&quot; (1910, later retitled &quot;The Three Royal Monkeys&quot;), praised by the literary historian Julia Briggs as a &quot;neglected masterpiece&quot; and by the critic Brian Stableford as a &quot;classic animal fantasy&quot;. Richard Adams described it as his favourite novel.

Joan Aiken cited some of de la Mare&#x27;s short stories, such as &quot;The Almond Tree&quot; and &quot;Sambo and the Snow Mountains&quot;, for their sometimes unexplained quality, which she also employed in her own work.

===Theory of imagination===

De la Mare described two distinct &quot;types&quot; of imagination – although &quot;aspects&quot; might be a better term: the childlike and the boylike. It was at the border between the two that Shakespeare, Dante, and the rest of the great poets lay.

De la Mare opined that all children fall into the category of having a childlike imagination at first, which is usually replaced at some point in their lives. He explained in the lecture &quot;Rupert Brooke and the Intellectual Imagination&quot; that children &quot;are not bound in by their groping senses. Facts to them are the liveliest of chameleons. [...] They are contemplatives, solitaries, fakirs, who sink again and again out of the noise and fever of existence and into a waking vision.&quot; His biographer Doris Ross McCrosson summarises this passage, &quot;Children are, in short, visionaries.&quot; This visionary view of life can be seen as either vital creativity and ingenuity, or fatal disconnection from reality (or, in a limited sense, both).

The increasing intrusions of the external world upon the mind, however, frighten the childlike imagination, which &quot;retires like a shocked snail into its shell&quot;. From then onward the boyish imagination flourishes, the &quot;intellectual, analytical type&quot;.

By adulthood (de la Mare proposed), the childlike imagination has either retreated forever or grown bold enough to face the real world. Thus emerge the two extremes of the spectrum of adult minds: logical and deductive or intuitive and inductive. For de la Mare, &quot;[t]he one knows that beauty is truth, the other reveals that truth is beauty.&quot; Yet another way he puts it is that the visionary&#x27;s source of poetry is within, while the intellectual&#x27;s sources are without – external – in &quot;action, knowledge of things, and experience&quot; (McCrosson&#x27;s phrasing). De la Mare hastens to add that this does not make the intellectual&#x27;s poetry any less good, but it is clear where his own preference lies.

==Legacy==
===References in books===
C. K. Scott Moncrieff, in translating Marcel Proust&#x27;s seven-volume work &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, used the last line of de la Mare&#x27;s poem &quot;The Ghost&quot; as the title of the sixth volume, &quot;The Sweet Cheat Gone&quot; (French: &quot;Albertine Disparu&quot; and &quot;La Fugitive&quot;).

In 1944 Faber and Faber and one of de la Mare&#x27;s friends, a certain Dr Bett, arranged to secretly produce a tribute for his 75th birthday. This publication was a collaborative effort involving many admirers of Walter de la Mare&#x27;s work, and included individual pieces by a variety of authors, including V. Sackville-West, J. B. Priestley, T. S. Eliot, Siegfried Sassoon, Lord Dunsany, and Henry Williamson.

Richard Adams&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Watership Down&quot; (1972) uses several of de la Mare&#x27;s poems as epigraphs.

De la Mare&#x27;s play &quot;Crossings&quot; has an important role in Robertson Davies&#x27;s novel &quot;The Manticore&quot;. In 1944, when the protagonist David Staunton is sixteen, de la Mare&#x27;s play is produced by the pupils of his sister&#x27;s school in Toronto. Staunton falls deeply in love with the girl playing the main role, a first love that has a profound effect on the rest of his life.

&quot;Symposium&quot; by Muriel Spark quotes de la Mare&#x27;s poem &quot;Fare Well&quot;: &quot;Look thy last on all things lovely / Every hour.&quot;.

===References in music===
Benjamin Britten set several of de la Mare&#x27;s verses to music: de la Mare&#x27;s version of the traditional song &quot;Levy-Dew&quot; in 1934, and five others, which were then collected in &quot;Tit for Tat&quot;.

Theodore Chanler used texts from de la Mare&#x27;s story &quot;Benighted&quot; for his song cycle &quot;8 Epitaphs&quot;.

<text>The Santa Compaña (Galician for &quot;Holy Company&quot;) is a deep-rooted mythical belief in rural northwest of Iberia: Galicia, Asturias (Spain), border zones of Castile and León (El Bierzo) and Northern Portugal. It is the Iberian version of the pan-European mythical motif known as the Wild Hunt.

It is also known under the names of &quot;Estadea&quot;, &quot;Estantiga&#x27;&quot; (&quot;estantigua&quot; in Spanish, from Latin &quot;hostis antiquus&quot;, meaning &quot;ancient host&quot;), &quot;Rolda&quot;, &quot;As da nuite&quot; (The Night Ones), &quot;Pantalla&quot;, &quot;Avisóns&quot;, &quot;Pantaruxada&quot;; all of which are terms that denote the presence of the dead in the world of the living. In Asturias it&#x27;s prominently well-known as Güestia, which is related to the Asturian word &quot;güeste&quot; (host in English language).

==Description==
Although many different versions of the Santa Compaña can be found, the common belief is that of a procession of the dead (or a procession of souls that are in torment) that wander through the village paths of a parish beginning at midnight wearing white, hooded cloaks.

The procession is led by a living person (usually a parishioner of a particular church) carrying a cross or a cauldron of holy water (sometimes they carry both), followed by several of the souls of the dead holding lit candles. Although these souls are not always seen, the popular legend claims that the scent of melted wax can be detected on the breeze as they pass to warn of their presence. The living leader of the procession is compelled by a supernatural force (in this case, a mysterious curse) to go out every night and walk by towns, villages and forests; but will have no recollection of it the following day. By the same token, because the living person is unaware of what he/she is doing, there is no chance that they will renounce their duty in leading the Santa Compaña, as the curse that forces them to lead the procession puts them into a trance every midnight. The procession ends before daybreak and the living leader of the procession returns to their bed with no memory of what occurred, but will awake the next morning still weary, as though they did not get adequate rest. This person can only be freed of the curse if they come across another person during the procession to carry the cross or the cauldron (or both), as the curse will be passed on to that person. It is said that if the curse leader does not pass the curse onto another person in a matter of weeks, he/she will eventually grow pale, thin and sickly and eventually die, following which the curse will be unknowingly passed on to another parishioner.

To avoid receiving the curse, the person who sees the Santa Compaña pass by must quickly draw &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Circle&quot; on the ground using chalk (a circle with Seal of Solomon inside a six-pointed star, which can be changed into a cross) and enter it, or lie face-down until the procession passes. Another way to evade the Santa Compaña is to tie a black cat in the middle of the Santa Compaña&#x27;s path and quickly run away from it, or to perform diverse warding symbols with both hands such as the horn gesture (extending the index and little fingers with the rest of the fingers folded inwards) or the fig sign (which consists of closing the fist and putting the thumb between the index and middle fingers). The person leading the procession can be a man or a woman—this depends on whether the patron saint of the parish is male or female. The Santa Compaña&#x27;s purpose is to announce death and its primary mission is to visit the homes where death is due.

According to popular belief, apart from the living procession leader, the Santa Compaña can&#x27;t be seen but can be felt, eliciting a shiver or shudder as it passes, accompanied with a sensation of intense danger. It is also believed that those who can see the Santa Compaña are people who, when baptised by the priest of their parish, were mistakenly anointed with holy oil for the sick instead of chrism. In other versions, it is believed that they are people with special sensibilities who are able to see hidden things. Some people are unable to see the souls in the procession but can see the light of their candles, floating in the air like ignis fatuus or will-o&#x27;-the-wisp (similar to the &quot;spook lights&quot; in the rural USA or &quot;jack o&#x27;lantern&quot; in the rural UK) as they move along their path.

==Origins==
It may be related to Odin&#x27;s Wild Hunt, or the Welsh Hounds of Annwn and the Breton Celtic westward processions of the dead to the End of the World. It is equivalent to the Irish Banshee and Breton Ankou.

<doc id="254486" wikidata="Q189550" url="?curid=254486" title="Imad al-Din Zengi">
<text>Imad al-Din Zengi (;  – 14 September 1146), also romanized as Zangi, Zengui, Zenki, and Zanki, was a Turkoman atabeg of the Seljuk Empire, who ruled Mosul, Aleppo, Hama, and, later, Edessa. He was the namesake and founder of the Zengid dynasty of atabegs.

==Early life==
Zengi&#x27;s father, Aq Sunqur al-Hajib, governor of Aleppo under Malik-Shah I, was beheaded by Tutush I for treason in 1094. At the time, Zengi was about 10 years old and was brought up by Kerbogha, the governor of Mosul. Zengi then served in the military of the Governors of Mosul, first under Jawali Saqawa (1106–1109), then Mawdud (1109–1113), and from 1114, under Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi.

Zengi remained in Mosul until 1118, when he entered into the service of the new Seljuk ruler Mahmūd (1118–1119). Upon Sanjar&#x27;s accession in 1119, Zengi remained loyal to Mahmūd, who became ruler of the Iraqi Seljuk Sultānate (1119–1131).

==Seljuk Governor of Iraq==
The region of Mesopotamia was under the control of the Seljuk Empire from 1055 to 1135, since Tughril Beg had expelled the Shiite Buyid dynasty. Tughril Beg was the first Seljuk ruler to style himself Sultan and Protector of the Abbasid Caliphate. Mesopotamia remained under the control of the Great Seljuks during the reign of Muhammad I Tapar (1082–1118), but from 1119, his 14 years old son Mahmud II (1118–1131) was restricted to the only rule of Iraq, while Sanjar took control of the rest of the Empire.

Wishing to contain the Banu Mazyad leader Dubays ibn Sadaqa, in 1122 Mahmūd II ordered a military expedition from Mosul to southern Iraq, commanded by Zengi and Altun-Tash al-Aburi under the orders of Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi. Zengi, for whom this was the first major military command, garrisoned his troops around Wasit, and was granted Governorship of the region of Wasit as an &quot;ıqta&quot;. In alliance with the troops of the Caliphate, they defeated Dubays at the Battle of Mubarraqiyya in 1123. Zengi then received in addition to his previous responsibilities the Military Governorship of Basra in 1124.

In order to counter the ambitions of Abbasid Caliph al-Mustarshid (1118–1135), who wanted to acquire world dominance, the Seljuks led by Mahmud II now waged a campaign against him. With some decisive leadership from Zengi, the Seljuks managed to take control of Baghdad and the Caliphate, pillaging the Caliph&#x27;s palace. The Caliph sued for peace and had to pay a huge ransom. In addition to his possessions in Wasit and Basra, Zengi was promoted and received the Governorship for Baghdad in April 1126, receiving the title of &quot;shihna&quot; effectively putting him in control of the whole of Seljuk Iraq. In 1227, following the murder of Aqsunqur al-Bursuqi, Zengi was named Governor of Mosul, where the Atabegdom of Mosul was formed.

==Atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo==
Following the death in 1128 of Toghtekin, &quot;atabeg&quot; of Damascus, a power vacuum threatened to open Syria to renewed Crusader aggression. Zengi became &quot;atabeg&quot; of Mosul in 1127 and of Aleppo in 1128, uniting the two cities under his personal rule, and was formally invested as their ruler by the Seljuk Sultan Mahmud II. Zengi had supported the young sultan against his rival, the caliph al-Mustarshid.

===Zengi against Damascus===
In 1130 Zengi allied with Taj al-Mulk Buri of Damascus against the Crusaders, but this was only a ruse to extend his power; he had Buri&#x27;s son taken prisoner and seized Hama from him. Zengi also besieged Homs, the governor of which was accompanying him at the time, but could not capture it, so he returned to Mosul, where Buri&#x27;s son and the other prisoners from Damascus were ransomed for 50,000 dinars. The next year, Zengi agreed to return the 50,000 dinars if Buri would deliver to him Dubais ibn Sadaqa, emir of al-Hilla in Iraq, who had fled to Damascus to escape al-Mustarshid. When an ambassador from the caliph arrived to bring Dubais back, Zengi attacked him and killed some of his retinue; the ambassador returned to Baghdad without Dubais.

Mahmud II died in 1131, setting off a war for the succession. As the Seljuk princes were occupied fighting one another in Persia, Zengi marched on Baghdad to add it to his dominions. He was defeated by the caliph&#x27;s troops, however, and only escaped thanks to the help of the governor of Tikrit, Najm ad-Din Ayyub. Several years later, Zengi would reward the governor with a position in his army, paving the way for Saladin&#x27;s brilliant career.
In 1134 Zengi became involved in Artuqid affairs, allying with the emir Timurtash (son of Ilghazi) against Timurtash&#x27;s cousin Rukn al-Dawla Da&#x27;ud. Zengi&#x27;s real desires, however, lay to the south, in Damascus. In 1135 Zengi received an appeal for help from Shams ul-Mulk Isma&#x27;il, who had succeeded his father Buri as emir of Damascus, and who was in fear for his life from his own citizenry, who considered him a cruel tyrant. Ismail was willing to surrender the city to Zengi in order to restore peace. None of Isma&#x27;il&#x27;s family or advisors wanted this, however, and Isma&#x27;il was murdered by his own mother, Zumurrud, to prevent him from turning over the city to Zengi&#x27;s control. Isma&#x27;il was succeeded by his brother Shihab al-Din Mahmud.

Zengi was not discouraged by this turn of events and arrived at Damascus anyway, still intending to seize it. The siege lasted for some time with no success on Zengi&#x27;s part, so a truce was made and Shahib al-Din&#x27;s brother Bahram-Shah was given as a hostage. At the same time, news of the siege had reached the caliph and Baghdad, and a messenger was sent with orders for Zengi to leave Damascus and take control of the governance of Iraq. The messenger was ignored, but Zengi gave up the siege, as per the terms of the truce with Shihab al-Din. On the way back to Aleppo, Zengi besieged Homs, whose governor had angered him, and Shihab al-Din responded to the city&#x27;s call for help by sending Mu&#x27;in al-Din Unur to govern it.

==War against Crusaders and Byzantine Empire==

In 1137 Imad-ud-din Zengi besieged Homs again, but Mu&#x27;in al-Din unur successfully defended it. In response, Damascus allied with the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem against him. 

In the Battle of Ba&#x27;rin (also known as Battle of Montferrand) in 1137, a Crusader force commanded by King Fulk of Jerusalem was scattered and defeated by Zengi, by that time atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo. This setback resulted in the permanent loss of the Crusader castle of Montferrand in Baarin. Crusader King Fulk of Jerusalem agreed to surrender and was allowed to flee with his surviving troops.

===War against the Byzantine–Crusader alliance=== 
Zengi, realizing that this new expedition against Damascus was bound to fail, made peace with Shahib al-Din, just in time to be confronted at Aleppo by an army sent by the Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus. The Emperor had recently brought the Crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, and had allied himself with Joscelin II of Edessa and Raymond of Antioch. Facing a combined Byzantine/Crusader threat, Zengi mobilized his forces and recruited assistance from other Muslim leaders. In April 1138 the armies of the Byzantine emperor and the Crusader princes laid siege to Shaizar, but they were turned back by Zengi&#x27;s forces a month later.

===Siege of Baalbek===
In May 1138 Zengi came to an agreement with Damascus. He married Zumurrud Khatun, the same woman who had murdered her son Ismail, and received Homs as her dowry. In July 1139 Zumurrud&#x27;s surviving son, Shihab al-Din, was assassinated, and Zengi marched on Damascus to take possession of the city. The Damascenes, united under Mu&#x27;in al-Din Unur, acting as regent for Shihab al-Din&#x27;s successor Jamal al-Din, once again allied with Jerusalem to repel Zengi. Zengi also besieged Jamal al-Din&#x27;s former possession of Baalbek, and Mu&#x27;in al-Din was in charge of its defenses as well. Zengi obtained its surrender in response to a promise of safe passage; he did not honor it, ordering that the defenders be crucified. Unlike Saladin at Jerusalem in 1187, Zengi did not keep his word to protect his captives at Baalbek in 1139. According to Ibn al-‘Adim, Zengi &quot;had sworn to the people of the citadel with strong oaths and on the Qur’an and divorcing (his wives). When they came down from the citadel he betrayed them, flayed its governor and hanged the rest.&quot; He granted the territory to his lieutenant Najm al-Din Ayyub, father of Saladin. After Zengi abandoned his siege of Damascus, Jamal al-Din died of a disease and was succeeded by his son Mujir al-Din, with Mu&#x27;in al-Din remaining as regent.

===Expansion and conflict with Armenia===
Mu&#x27;in al-Din signed a new peace treaty with Jerusalem for their mutual protection against Zengi. While Mu&#x27;in al-Din and the crusaders joined together to besiege Banias in 1140, Zengi once more laid siege to Damascus, but quickly abandoned it again. There were no major engagements between the crusaders, Damascus, and Zengi for the next few years, but Zengi in the meantime campaigned in the north and captured Ashib and the Armenian fortress of Hizan.

===Conquest of Edessa===
In 1144, Zengi began the siege of Edessa against the crusader County of Edessa, one of the four original crusader states established after the First Crusade, and captured it on December 24, 1144, after a siege of four months. County of Edessa was the first crusader state to be created and was also the first to fall. This event led to the Second Crusade, and later Muslim chroniclers noted it as the start of the &quot;jihad&quot; against the Crusader states.

==Death and legacy==

Zengi continued his attempts to take Damascus in 1145, but he was assassinated by a Frankish slave named Yarankash in September 1146, after the atabeg drunkenly threatened him with punishment for drinking from his goblet.

According to Ibn &#x27;al-Adim:
Zengi was the founder of the eponymous Zengid dynasty. In Mosul he was succeeded by his eldest son Sayf al-Din Ghazi I, and in Aleppo he was succeeded by his second son Nur al-Din. When Sayf died in 1149, he was succeeded in Mosul by a third son Qutb al-Din Mawdud.

<doc id="254493" wikidata="Q7737488" url="?curid=254493" title="The Grand Old Duke of York">
<text>&quot;The Grand Old Duke of York&quot; is an English children&#x27;s nursery rhyme, often performed as an action song. The duke has been argued to be a number of the bearers of that title, particularly Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827), and its lyrics (where the duke marches ten thousand soldiers up and down a hill for no apparent reason) have become proverbial for futile action. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 742.

&quot;The Grand Old Duke of York&quot; is also sung to the tune of &quot;A-Hunting We Will Go&quot;.

==Words==

A modern version is:

&lt;poem&gt;Oh, the grand old Duke of York,
He had ten thousand men;
He marched them up to the top of the hill,
And he marched them down again.

When they were up, they were up,
And when they were down, they were down,
And when they were only halfway up,
They were neither up nor down.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Origins==

Like many popular nursery rhymes the origins of the song have been much debated and remain unclear. Unusually the rhyme clearly refers to a historical person and debates have tended to circulate around identifying which Duke is being referred to in the lyrics. The lyrics were not printed in their modern form until relatively recently, in Arthur Rackham&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose&quot; in 1913. Prior to that a number of alternatives have been found including a note that in Warwickshire in 1892 the song was sung of both the Duke of York and the King of France; from 1894 that it was sung of Napoleon. The oldest version of the song that survives is from 1642, under the title &#x27;Old Tarlton&#x27;s song&#x27;, attributed to the stage clown Richard Tarlton (1530–1588) with the lyrics:

&lt;poem&gt;The King of France with forty thousand men,
Came up a hill and so came downe againe.&lt;/poem&gt;

As a result, the argument has been made that it may have been a common satirical verse that was adapted as appropriate and, because it was recorded in roughly the modern form, has become fixed on the Duke of York. Candidates for the duke in question include:

* Richard, Duke of York (1411–1460), who was defeated at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460. Richard&#x27;s army, some 8,000 strong, was awaiting reinforcements at Sandal Castle in Wakefield (the castle was built on top of a Norman motte). He was surrounded by Lancastrian forces some three times that number, but chose to sally forth to fight. Richard died in a pitched battle at Wakefield Green, together with between one third and one half of his army.
* James II (1633–1701), formerly Duke of York, who in 1688 marched his troops to Salisbury Plain to resist the invasion from his son-in-law William of Orange, only to retreat and disperse them as his support began to evaporate.
* The most common attribution is to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany (1763–1827), the second son of King George III and Commander-in-Chief of the British Army during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. His most significant field command was during the Flanders Campaign of 1793–94. Despite the British troops having some success against the French, in the summer of 1794 the Duke was obliged to retreat into the Netherlands and he was subsequently recalled to England. Flanders having something of a reputation for being flat, the specific location of the &quot;hill&quot; in the nursery rhyme has been suggested to be the town of Cassel, which is built on a hill which rises 176 metres (about 570 feet) above the flat lands of French Flanders in northern France.

Apart from the ducal title in the song and the events of their lives there is no external evidence to link the rhyme to any of these candidates.

== Dutch version ==

A Dutch adaptation of the song replaces the Duke of York with Maurice, Prince of Orange (1567–1625), whose practice of training mercenaries (completely new and mocked at first) became famous after his success in war. It is not known when the British song crossed the North Sea, but it is now well known within the Dutch scouting movement.

== In popular culture ==
In February 2022, parodies of the nursery rhyme referencing Prince Andrew, Duke of York&#x27;s reported £12 million out-of-court settlement with Virginia Giuffre had entered circulation. A version reported in the media contained the lyrics:
The grand old Duke of York, he had twelve million quid.

He gave it to someone he never met, for something he never did.
Later in May, the black comedy musician Kunt and the Gang released the satirical single &quot;Prince Andrew Is a Sweaty Nonce&quot; about the controversy surrounding his 2019 interview with Emily Maitlis on &quot;Newsnight&quot;. The single&#x27;s verses directly interpolate the nursery rhyme.

<text>The Power Mac G5 is a series of personal computers designed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 2003 to 2006 as part of the Power Mac series. When introduced, it was the most powerful computer in Apple&#x27;s Macintosh lineup, and was marketed by the company as the world&#x27;s first 64-bit desktop computer. It was also the first desktop computer from Apple to use an anodized aluminum alloy enclosure, and one of only three computers in Apple&#x27;s lineup to utilize the PowerPC 970 CPU, the others being the iMac G5 and the Xserve G5.

Three generations of Power Mac G5 were released before it was discontinued as part of the Mac transition to Intel processors, making way for its replacement, the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro retained a variation of the G5&#x27;s enclosure design for seven more years, making it among the longest-lived designs in Apple&#x27;s history.

== Introduction ==
Officially launched as part of Steve Jobs&#x27; keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2003, the Power Mac G5 was introduced with three models, sharing the same physical case, but differing in features and performance. Although somewhat larger than the G4 tower it replaced, the necessity for a complex cooling system meant that the G5 tower had room inside for only one optical drive and two hard drives.

Steve Jobs stated during his keynote presentation that the Power Mac G5 would reach 3 GHz &quot;within 12 months.&quot; This would never come to pass; after three years, the G5 only reached 2.7 GHz before it was replaced by the Intel Xeon-based Mac Pro, which debuted with processors running at speeds of up to 3 GHz.

During the presentation, Apple also showed Virginia Tech&#x27;s Mac OS X computer cluster supercomputer (a.k.a. supercluster) known as &quot;System X&quot;, consisting of 1,100 Power Mac G5 towers operating as processing nodes. The supercomputer managed to become one of the top five supercomputers that year. The computer was soon dismantled and replaced with a new cluster made of an equal number of Xserve G5 rack-mounted servers, which also used the G5 chip running at 2.3 GHz.

== PowerPC G5 and the IBM partnership ==

The PowerPC G5 (called the PowerPC 970 by its manufacturer, IBM) is based upon IBM&#x27;s 64-bit POWER4 microprocessor. At the Power Mac G5&#x27;s introduction, Apple announced a partnership with IBM in which IBM would continue to produce PowerPC variants of their POWER processors. According to IBM&#x27;s Dr. John E. Kelly, &quot;The goal of this partnership is for Apple and IBM to come together so that Apple customers get the best of both worlds, the tremendous creativity from the Apple corporation and the tremendous technology from the IBM corporation. IBM invested over US$3 billion in a new lab to produce these large, 300 mm wafers.&quot; This completely automated facility in East Fishkill, New York figured heavily in IBM&#x27;s larger microelectronics strategy.

The original PowerPC 970 had 50 million transistors and was manufactured using IBM CMOS 9S at 130 nm fabrication process. CMOS 9S is the combination of SOI, low-k dielectric insulation, and copper interconnect technology, which were invented at IBM research in the mid-1990s. Subsequent revisions of the &quot;G5&quot; processor have included IBM&#x27;s PowerPC 970FX (same basic design on a 90 nm process), and the PowerPC 970MP (essentially two 970FX cores on one die). Apple refers to the dual-core PowerPC 970MP processors as either the &quot;G5 Dual&quot; (for single-socket, dual-core configurations), or Power Mac G5 Quad (for dual-socket, four-core configurations).

== Architecture ==

The Power Mac G5 line in 2006 consisted of three, dual-core PowerPC G5 configurations, which can communicate through its HyperTransport at half its internal clock speed. Each processor in the Power Mac G5 has two unidirectional 32-bit pathways: one leading to the processor and the other from the processor. These result in a total bandwidth of up to 20 GB/s. The processor at the heart of the Power Mac G5 has a &quot;superscalar, superpipelined&quot; execution core that can handle up to 216 in-flight instructions, and uses a 128-bit, 162-instruction SIMD unit (AltiVec).

All modern 32-bit x86 processors since the Pentium Pro have the Physical Address Extension (PAE) feature, which permits them to use a 36-bit physical memory address to address a maximum of 236 bytes (64 gigabytes) of physical memory, while the PowerPC 970 processor is capable of addressing 242 bytes (4 terabytes) of physical memory and 264 bytes (16 exabytes) of virtual memory. Due to its 64-bit processor (and 42-bit MMU), the final revision of the Power Mac G5 can hold 16 GB of Dual-Channel DDR2 PC4200 RAM using eight memory slots, with support for ECC memory.

== Product revision history ==

* 2003 June: Initial release at speeds of Single 1.6, Single 1.8, Dual 2.0 GHz.
* 2003 November: Dual 1.8 replaces Single 1.8 GHz; price reduction on Single 1.6 GHz.
* 2004 June: 90 nm Dual 1.8, Dual 2.0 and Dual 2.5 GHz replace all previous models. The 2.5 GHz model is notable as the first major PC with liquid cooling included as stock.
* 2004 October: A new Single 1.8 reintroduced, with a slower, 600 MHz HyperTransport, PCI bus, based upon the iMac G5&#x27;s architecture (U3lite and Shasta chips). Apple&#x27;s official name for this machine is &quot;Power Mac G5 (Late 2004)&quot;.
* 2005 April: CPU speed increased: Dual 2.5 GHz → Dual 2.7 GHz (PCI-X, LC), Dual 2.0 GHz → Dual 2.3 GHz (PCI-X), Dual 1.8 GHz → Dual 2.0 GHz (PCI). Newly introduced features were the 16x dual-layer SuperDrives across the line and increased storage, up to 800 GB for the higher-end models. The 1.8 GHz Single was not modified.
* 2005 June–July: The Single 1.8 model was discontinued in the United States and Europe.
* 2005 October: Shift to dual-core processors: Dual 2.0 GHz → DC 2.0 GHz, Dual 2.3 GHz → DC 2.3 GHz, Dual 2.7 GHz → Dual DC 2.5 GHz (termed a Quad Power Mac G5, with four CPU execution cores and more reliable liquid cooling), all with DDR2 memory, and PCI Express expansion in place of PCI-X. The older PCI-X, Dual 2.7 GHz model remained available for a while, but the slower speed single-core models were discontinued immediately.
* 2006 August: The Power Mac is replaced by its Intel successor, the Mac Pro.

== Technical specifications ==


== Defects ==

Early versions of dual processor G5 computers have noise problems. The first one is ground loop-based interference, which sometimes causes noise leaks into the analog audio outputs. This bug was fixed in Rev. B G5.

The second noise problem came from the &#x27;chirping&#x27; sound, which can be triggered by fluctuations in power draw. For example, using Exposé causes a brief chirp. A widely circulated work-around is to disable the CPUs&#x27; &quot;nap&quot; feature using Apple&#x27;s CHUD Tools, but this was not recommended by Apple. This noise problem was not fixed until the dual core generation of G5s was produced, however it did not affect the &quot;Late 2004&quot; model (at least there have never been any reports). The power draw fluctuation was later attributed to the lack of power management features in the single-core processors. Apple eventually posted the chirping bug information on its support site.

Although the noise problems did not prevent the affected computers from working, they were problematic for audio professionals and enthusiasts, especially for the liquid-cooled models, which had been expressly designed as mechanically quiet for discerning listeners.

A common problem among single processor G5s was the cyclic expansion and contraction of a metal plate soldered to the Logic Board connecting all eight of the RAM slots. Eventually, this can cause the computer to no longer detect the RAM, and refuse to boot. Fixes for this include having the plate re-soldered, or exposing the other side of the Logic Board to heat from a heat gun. The latter option is far easier, since it requires neither soldering nor the removal of the Logic Board from the computer.

All 2.5 GHz and 2.7 GHz dual processor models and the 2.5 GHz quad-processor model had a liquid cooling system that consisted of a radiator, coolant pump, and heat exchangers bolted to the processors. The cooling system was made by Delphi Automotive, a former Harrison Radiator Division of General Motors. This was a bold step for Apple, and should have allowed the use of very fast processors, giving Apple an advantage in both performance and reliability, but the system turned out to be subject to coolant leakage, made worse by the system&#x27;s use of GM Dexcool coolant, which is more corrosive than regular automotive coolant.&lt;ref name=&quot;PowerMac G5 Coolant Leaks/Repairs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If not caught in time, the leakage could destroy the processors, logic board, and even corrode the aluminum casing itself. While leakage was sometimes detectable by drops of green coolant in or beneath the machine, in many machines the seepage is so slight that it was almost impossible to detect without dismantling the entire computer. Later models (only the 2.7 GHz) were equipped with a Panasonic liquid cooling system which was much more reliable.

The liquid cooling system fits into the case where the heat sinks would normally go, so there is no easy way to distinguish the liquid-cooled versions from the air-cooled, although most, but not all, of the liquid-cooled machines have a sticker inside warning about the possibility of leakage. 

== P.A. Semi&#x27;s G5 derivative ==
When P.A. Semi announced the preliminary pre-production plan of PWRficient processor, there had been persistent rumors that Apple would prepare for its use in its professional line of personal computers.

In 2006, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that P.A. Semi had formed a tight relationship with Apple, which would result in P.A. Semi promptly delivering processor chips for Apple&#x27;s personal computer notebook line and possibly desktops. Even in 2006, Apple did not have a laptop version of the G5 processor. The processor that would run the personal computers was P.A. Semi&#x27;s preliminarily proposed processor, PWRficient 1682M (PA6T-1682M). The version that would be sampled for pre-production at third quarter of 2006 was a 2 GHz, dual-core CPU with two DDR2 memory controllers, 2 MB of L2 cache, and support for 8 PCI Express lanes. The sampled chip also has lower heat intensity than Intel&#x27;s Core Duo, which gives off 9–31 W under normal load.

According to &quot;The Register&quot; article, P.A. Semi executives believed that they were all but assured of winning Apple&#x27;s contract, and CEO Dan Dobberpuhl thought that Apple&#x27;s hints of moving to Intel were just a persuading tactic. At the time, the companies were working for PWRficient software.

Despite the advantages of more compatible architecture, Apple moved to the Intel architecture officially for &#x27;performance-per-watt&#x27; reasons. However, P.A. Semi would not be able to ship its low-power multicore product in volume until 2007, which, combined with P.A. Semi&#x27;s status as a start-up company, seems to have been the final blow to the development of Power Mac computers. However, it was also speculated that Apple switched to Intel processor because Apple could no longer abide the constant delays in performance ramp up, desired native Windows compatibility, or it was Apple&#x27;s strategy to shift its business focus away from desktop computing to iPod (and subsequently iOS) development.

Apple acquired P.A. Semi in 2008, using P.A. Semi&#x27;s engineering resources to develop ARM CPUs for their iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and Apple TV product lines; and would go on to eventually come full circle with these designs replacing Intel chips in Macs in 2020.

The PA6T-1682M processor would later be used by the AmigaOne X1000 personal computer.

<doc id="254498" wikidata="Q47598" url="?curid=254498" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">
<text>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. It is the third instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The novel follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner from Azkaban, the wizard prison, believed to be one of Lord Voldemort&#x27;s old allies.

The book was published in the United Kingdom on 8 July 1999 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 8 September 1999 by Scholastic, Inc. Rowling found the book easy to write, finishing it just a year after she began writing it. The book sold 68,000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom and since has sold over three million in the country. The book won the 1999 Whitbread Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Bram Stoker Award, and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and was short-listed for other awards, including the Hugo.

The film adaptation of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796 million and earning critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

==Plot==
During the summer, Harry accidentally performs magic at the home of his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon by blowing up his Aunt Marge, causing her to float into the sky. After this incident, he leaves their house and travels to London by The Knight Bus. At London, he spends his summer there. While staying at the Leaky Cauldron inn, Harry is visited by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, who warns him about Sirius Black, a mass-murderer who escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban.

With Black at large, Dementors have been stationed at Hogwarts as a security measure. During a Care of Magical Creatures lesson with Hagrid, Draco Malfoy is injured after provoking a hippogriff named Buckbeak. Draco&#x27;s father, Lucius Malfoy, gets Hagrid put on trial for owning a dangerous creature. Harry repeatedly faints in the presence of the Dementors, but eventually is taught by Professor Lupin, a new teacher, how to repel them using the Patronus Charm. When Harry is unable to participate in weekend trips to Hogsmeade Village, Fred and George give him a magical map that shows him how to get there using a secret passage. At the Three Broomsticks pub, Harry overhears that Black is his godfather, that he betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents to Voldemort, and that he now seeks to kill Harry as well. 

When Ron&#x27;s pet rat Scabbers disappears, he blames Hermione and her cat Crookshanks. Ron and Hermione stop talking to each other, although Hermione is distraught when Ron survives an attack by Black inside the Gryffindor dormitory. After the attack, Black cannot be found. After Harry, Ron and Hermione learn that Buckbeak will be executed, they console Hagrid, and Ron and Hermione resume their friendship. Ron also finds Scabbers, who was hiding in Hagrid&#x27;s hut. As the friends make their way back to the castle, Ron is attacked by a large black dog, which drags him through the passageway leading to Hogsmeade. Harry and Hermione give chase, and find themselves in the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is revealed to be Black in his Animagus form. Lupin arrives, and Black states that he intends to kill Scabbers, not Harry. He explains that Scabbers is Peter Pettigrew, who betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents to Voldemort and framed Black for mass murder. Black and Lupin compel Pettigrew to transform into human form, then haul him back to Hogwarts.

On the way to the castle, the full moon causes Lupin to transform into a werewolf. Pettigrew escapes and is pursued by Black, Harry and Hermione, who encounter Dementors and lose consciousness. They awaken in the castle, where Black is now being held captive. Harry and Hermione proclaim his innocence to Dumbledore, who suggests using Hermione&#x27;s Time Turner. Harry and Hermione travel back in time and save both Black and Buckbeak, who fly away together. Snape blames Lupin for Black&#x27;s disappearance and makes his werewolf-identity public, which forces Lupin to resign. On the train back to London, Harry receives a letter from Black, expressing his gratitude to Harry for saving his life.

==Publication and reception==
===Pre-release history===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is the third book in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series. The first, &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, was published by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, was published on 2 July 1998. Rowling started to write the &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; the day after she finished &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot;. Rowling said in 2004 that &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was &quot;the best writing experience I ever had...I was in a very comfortable place writing (number) three. Immediate financial worries were over, and press attention wasn&#x27;t yet by any means excessive&quot;.

===Critical reception===
Upon release, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; received mostly positive reviews. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several British publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Observer&quot; review under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported an average rating of 9 out of 10 for the book based on reviews from multiple British newspapers. On &quot;BookBrowse&quot;, based on American press, the book received a from &quot;Critics&#x27; Consensus&quot; and for the media reviews on a rating scale out of five: &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and &quot;School Library Journal&quot; reviews under five and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; review under four. 

Gregory Maguire wrote a review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;: in it he said, &quot;So far, in terms of plot, the books do nothing new, but they do it brilliantly...so far, so good.&quot; In a newspaper review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it was said that &quot;&#x27;The Prisoner of Azkaban&#x27; may be the best &#x27;Harry Potter&#x27; book yet&quot;. A reviewer for KidsReads said, &quot;This crisply-paced fantasy will leave you hungry for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry&#x27;s third year is a charm. Don&#x27;t miss it.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; did not give a starred review but said, &quot;a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or get out of the way if they are not.&quot; Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;, calling it &quot;quite a good book.&quot; In addition, a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; review said, &quot;Rowling&#x27;s wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong&quot;.

However, Anthony Holden, who was one of the judges against &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; for the Whitbread Award, was negative about the book, saying that the characters are &quot;all black-and-white&quot;, and the &quot;story-lines are predictable, the suspense minimal, the sentimentality cloying every page&quot;.

In 2012 it was ranked number 12 on a list of the top 100 children&#x27;s novels published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

===Awards===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; won several awards, including the 1999 Booklist Editors&#x27; Choice Award, the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Best Work for Young Readers, the 1999 FCBG Children&#x27;s Book Award, the 1999 Whitbread Book of the Year for children&#x27;s books, and the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. It was also nominated for the 2000 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the first in the series nominated, but lost to &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot;. &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; additionally won the 2004 Indian Paintbrush Book Award and the 2004 Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award. Additionally, it was named an American Library Association Notable Children&#x27;s Book in 2000 as well as one of their Best Books for Young Adults. As with the previous two books in the series, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; won the Nestlé Smarties Book Prize Gold Medal for children aged 9–11 and made the top of the New York Times Best Seller list. In both cases, it was the last in the series to do so. However, in the latter case, a Children&#x27;s Best Sellers list was created just before the release of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; in July 2000 in order to free up more room on the original list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 24 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

===Sales===
&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; sold more than 68,000 copies in the UK within three days of publication, which made it the fastest selling British book of the time. The sales total by 2012 is said by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to be 3,377,906.

==Editions==

&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was issued, prior to publication, in two distinct UK proof editions, and one US &quot;Advance Reader&#x27;s Edition&quot;. The first UK proof, in purple wrappers, differs from the second in a number of respects, and is thought to have been printed in a small edition of 50 copies. The second UK proof is in green wrappers and was printed in a somewhat larger run. The US Advance Reader&#x27;s Edition is the last of its kind in the Harry Potter series, as no Advance Reader&#x27;s Editions are known for books 4 through 7. The rear wrapper of the Advance Reader&#x27;s Edition reveals the circumstances of the US publication of the book:

&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was released in hardcover in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September. The UK edition was released at the unusually precise time of 3.45pm, so as to avoid children skipping school in order to purchase the book. The first state of the hardback edition features an error on p. 7, with an unintended carriage return in a block quote. Two further issues were released, both fixing the error. Across all three states, 5,150 were printed by Clays Ltd.

The British paperback edition was released on 1 April 2000, while the US paperback was released 1 October 2001.

Bloomsbury additionally released an adult edition with a different cover design to the original, in paperback on 10 July 2004 and in hardcover in October 2004. A hardcover special edition, featuring a green border and signature, was released on 8 July 1999. In May 2004, Bloomsbury released a Celebratory Edition, with a blue and purple border. On 1 November 2010, they released the 10th anniversary Signature edition illustrated by Clare Mellinsky and in July 2013 a new adult cover illustrated by Andrew Davidson, both these editions were designed by Webb &amp; Webb Design Limited.

Beginning on 27 August 2013, Scholastic will release new covers for the paperback editions of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in the United States to celebrate 15 years of the series. The covers were designed by the author and illustrator Kazu Kibuishi.

An illustrated version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was released on 3 October 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay, who illustrated the previous two instalments. This includes over 115 new illustrations and will be followed by Illustrated editions of the following 4 novels in the future. Jim Kay announced on 6 October 2022 that he would not be illustrating the final two Harry Potter books and that his last work, &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, would be released on 11 October 2022.

==Adaptations==

===Film===

The film version of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was released in 2004 and was directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. The film débuted at number one at the box office and held that position for two weeks. It made a total of $796.7 million worldwide, which made it the second highest-grossing film of 2004 behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. However, among all eight entries in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; grossed the lowest; yet among critics and fans, the film is often cited as the best in the franchise – in large part due to Cuarón&#x27;s stylistic influence. The film ranks at number 471 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.

===Video games===
Three unique video games by different developers were released in 2004 by Electronic Arts, loosely based on the book:

<doc id="254507" wikidata="Q318354" url="?curid=254507" title="Percy Grainger">
<text>Percy Aldridge Grainger (born George Percy Grainger; 8 July 188220 February 1961) was an Australian-born composer, arranger and pianist who moved to the United States in 1914 and became an American citizen in 1918. In the course of a long and innovative career he played a prominent role in the revival of interest in British folk music in the early years of the 20th century. Although much of his work was experimental and unusual, the piece with which he is most generally associated is his piano arrangement of the folk-dance tune &quot;Country Gardens&quot;.

Grainger left Australia at the age of 13 to attend the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. Between 1901 and 1914 he was based in London, where he established himself first as a society pianist and later as a concert performer, composer, and collector of original folk melodies. As his reputation grew he met many of the significant figures in European music, forming important friendships with Frederick Delius and Edvard Grieg. He became a champion of Nordic music and culture, his enthusiasm for which he often expressed in private letters, sometimes in crudely racial or anti-Semitic terms.

In 1914 Grainger moved to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life, though he travelled widely in Europe and Australia. He served briefly as a bandsman in the United States Army during the First World War through 1917–18, and took American citizenship in 1918. After his mother&#x27;s suicide in 1922, he became increasingly involved in educational work. He also experimented with music machines, which he hoped would supersede human interpretation. In the 1930s he set up the Grainger Museum in Melbourne, his birthplace, as a monument to his life and works, and as a future research archive. As he grew older, he continued to give concerts and to revise and rearrange his own compositions, while writing little new music. After the Second World War, ill health reduced his levels of activity. He considered his career a failure. He gave his last concert in 1960, less than a year before his death.

== Early life ==
=== Family background ===

Grainger was born on 8 July 1882 in Brighton, south-east of Melbourne. His father, John Grainger, an English-born architect who had emigrated to Australia in 1877, won recognition for his design of the Princes Bridge across the Yarra River in Melbourne; His mother Rose Annie Aldridge was the daughter of Adelaide hotelier George Aldridge.

John Grainger was an accomplished artist, with broad cultural interests and a wide circle of friends. These included David Mitchell, whose daughter Helen later gained worldwide fame as an operatic soprano under the name Nellie Melba. John&#x27;s claims to have &quot;discovered&quot; her are unfounded, although he may have offered her encouragement. John was a heavy drinker and a womaniser who, Rose learned after the marriage, had fathered a child in England before coming to Australia. His promiscuity placed deep strains upon the relationship. Rose discovered shortly after Percy&#x27;s birth that she had contracted a form of syphilis from her husband. Despite this, the Graingers stayed together until 1890, when John went to England for medical treatment. After his return to Australia, they lived apart. Rose took over the work of raising Percy, while John pursued his career as chief architect to the Western Australian Department of Public Works. He had some private work, designing Nellie Melba&#x27;s home, Coombe Cottage, at Coldstream.

=== Childhood ===

Except for three months&#x27; formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic &quot;Saga of Grettir the Strong&quot; was &quot;the strongest single artistic influence on my life&quot;. As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German-born graduate of the Moscow Conservatory, Melbourne&#x27;s leading piano teacher. Grainger&#x27;s first known composition, &quot;A Birthday Gift to Mother&quot;, is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger&#x27;s first public concert appearances, at Melbourne&#x27;s Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.

After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger&#x27;s new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894 at Melbourne&#x27;s Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him &quot;the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master&quot;. This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne&#x27;s Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he maintained considerable patriotic feelings for his native land, and was proud of his Australian heritage.

=== Frankfurt ===

In Frankfurt, Rose established herself as a teacher of English; her earnings were supplemented by contributions from John Grainger, who had settled in Perth. The Hoch Conservatory&#x27;s reputation for piano teaching had been enhanced by the tenure, until 1892, of Clara Schumann as head of piano studies. Grainger&#x27;s piano tutor was James Kwast, who developed his young pupil&#x27;s skills to the extent that, within a year, Grainger was being lauded as a prodigy. Grainger had difficult relations with his original composition teacher, Iwan Knorr; he withdrew from Knorr&#x27;s classes to study composition privately with Karl Klimsch, an amateur composer and folk-music enthusiast, whom he would later honour as &quot;my only composition teacher&quot;.

Together with a group of slightly older British students – Roger Quilter, Balfour Gardiner, Cyril Scott and Norman O&#x27;Neill, all of whom became his friends – Grainger helped form the Frankfurt Group. Their long-term objective was to rescue British and Scandinavian music from what they considered the negative influences of central European music. Encouraged by Klimsch, Grainger turned away from composing classical pastiches reminiscent of Handel, Haydn and Mozart, and developed a personal compositional style, the originality and maturity of which quickly impressed and astonished his friends. At this time Grainger discovered the poetry of Rudyard Kipling and began setting it to music; according to Scott, &quot;No poet and composer have been so suitably wedded since Heine and Schumann.&quot;

After accompanying her son on an extended European tour in the summer of 1900, Rose, whose health had been poor for some time, suffered a nervous collapse and could no longer work. To replace lost income, Grainger began giving piano lessons and public performances; his first solo recital was in Frankfurt on 6 December 1900. Meanwhile, he continued his studies with Kwast, and increased his repertoire until he was confident he could support himself and his mother as a concert pianist. Having chosen London as his future base, in May 1901 Grainger abandoned his studies. With Rose, he left Frankfurt for the UK.

Before leaving Frankfurt, Grainger had fallen in love with Kwast&#x27;s daughter Mimi. In an autobiographical essay dated 1947, he says that he was &quot;already sex-crazy&quot; at this time, when he was 19. John Bird, Grainger&#x27;s biographer, records that during his Frankfurt years, Grainger began to develop sexual appetites that were &quot;distinctly abnormal&quot;; by the age of 16 he had started to experiment in flagellation and other sado-masochistic practices, which he continued to pursue through most of his adult life. Bird surmises that Grainger&#x27;s fascination with themes of punishment and pain derived from the harsh discipline to which Rose had subjected him as a child.

== London years ==
=== Concert pianist ===
In London, Grainger&#x27;s charm, good looks and talent (with some assistance from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons. He was soon performing in concerts in private homes. &quot;The Times&quot; critic reported after one such appearance that Grainger&#x27;s playing &quot;revealed rare intelligence and a good deal of artistic insight&quot;. In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger&#x27;s senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a &quot;love-serve job&quot;. She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced &quot;an overpowering landslide&quot; of feeling, and that &quot;I thought I was about to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don&#x27;t think that any joy entered into it&quot;.

In February 1902 Grainger made his first appearance as a piano soloist with an orchestra, playing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s first piano concerto with the Bath Pump Room Orchestra. In October of that year he toured Britain in a concert party with Adelina Patti, the Italian-born opera singer. Patti was greatly taken by the young pianist and prophesied a glorious career for him. The following year he met the German-Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni. Initially the two men were on cordial terms (Busoni offered to give Grainger lessons free of charge) and, as a result, Grainger spent part of the 1903 summer in Berlin as Busoni&#x27;s pupil. However, the visit was not a success; as Bird notes, Busoni had expected &quot;a willing slave and adoring disciple&quot;, a role Grainger was not willing to fulfil. Grainger returned to London in July 1903; almost immediately he departed with Rose on a 10-month tour of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, as a member of a party organised by the Australian contralto Ada Crossley.

=== Emergent composer ===
Before going to London Grainger had composed numerous Kipling settings and his first mature orchestral pieces. In London, when he found time he continued to compose; a letter to Balfour Gardiner dated 21 July 1901 indicates that he was working on his &quot;Marching Song of Democracy&quot; (a Walt Whitman setting), and had made good progress with the experimental works &quot;Train Music&quot; and &quot;Charging Irishrey&quot;. In his early London years he also composed &quot;Hill Song Number 1&quot; (1902), an instrumental piece much admired by Busoni.
In 1905, inspired by a lecture given by the pioneer folk-song historian Lucy Broadwood, Grainger began to collect original folk songs. Starting at Brigg in Lincolnshire, over the next five years he gathered and transcribed more than 300 songs from all over the country, including much material that had never been written down before. From 1906 Grainger used a phonograph, one of the first collectors to do so, and by this means he assembled more than 200 Edison cylinder recordings of native folk singers. These activities coincided with what Bird calls &quot;the halcyon days of the &#x27;First English Folksong Revival.

As his stature in the music world increased, Grainger became acquainted with many of its leading figures, including Vaughan Williams, Elgar, Richard Strauss and Debussy. In 1907 he met Frederick Delius, with whom he achieved an immediate rapport – the two musicians had similar ideas about composition and harmony, and shared a dislike for the classical German masters. Both were inspired by folk music; Grainger gave Delius his setting of the folk song &quot;Brigg Fair&quot;, which the older composer developed into his well-known orchestral rhapsody, dedicated to Grainger. The two remained close friends until Delius&#x27;s death in 1934.

Grainger first met Edvard Grieg at the home of the London financier Sir Edgar Speyer, in May 1906. As a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the Norwegian&#x27;s harmonic originality, and by 1906 had several Grieg pieces in his concert repertoire, including the piano concerto. Grieg was greatly impressed with Grainger&#x27;s playing, and wrote: &quot;I have written Norwegian Peasant Dances that no one in my country can play, and here comes this Australian who plays them as they ought to be played! He is a genius that we Scandinavians cannot do other than love.&quot; During 1906–07 the two maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence, which culminated in Grainger&#x27;s ten-day visit in July 1907 to the composer&#x27;s Norwegian home, &quot;Troldhaugen&quot; near Bergen. Here the two spent much time revising and rehearsing the piano concerto in preparation for that year&#x27;s Leeds Festival. Plans for a long-term working relationship were ended by Grieg&#x27;s sudden death in September 1907; nevertheless, this relatively brief acquaintance had a considerable impact on Grainger, and he championed Grieg&#x27;s music for the rest of his life.

After fulfilling a hectic schedule of concert engagements in Britain and continental Europe, in August 1908 Grainger accompanied Ada Crossley on a second Australasian tour, during which he added several cylinders of Maori and Polynesian music to his collection of recordings. He had resolved to establish himself as a top-ranking pianist before promoting himself as a composer, though he continued to compose both original works and folk-song settings. Some of his most successful and most characteristic pieces, such as &quot;Mock Morris&quot;, &quot;Handel in the Strand&quot;, &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Hey&quot; and &quot;Molly on the Shore&quot; date from this period. In 1908 he obtained the tune of &quot;Country Gardens&quot; from the folk music specialist Cecil Sharp, though he did not fashion it into a performable piece for another ten years.

In 1911 Grainger finally felt confident enough of his standing as a pianist to begin large-scale publishing of his compositions. At the same time, he adopted the professional name of &quot;Percy Aldridge Grainger&quot; for his published compositions and concert appearances. In a series of concerts arranged by Balfour Gardiner at London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall in March 1912, five of Grainger&#x27;s works were performed to great public acclaim; the band of thirty guitars and mandolins for the performance of &quot;Fathers and Daughters&quot; created a particular impression. On 21 May 1912 Grainger presented the first concert devoted entirely to his own compositions, at the Aeolian Hall, London; the concert was, he reported, &quot;a sensational success&quot;. A similarly enthusiastic reception was given to Grainger&#x27;s music at a second series of Gardiner concerts the following year.

In 1905 Grainger began a close friendship with Karen Holten, a Danish music student who had been recommended to him as a piano pupil. She became an important confidante; the relationship persisted for eight years, largely through correspondence. After her marriage in 1916, she and Grainger continued to correspond and occasionally met until her death in 1953. Grainger was briefly engaged in 1913 to another pupil, Margot Harrison, but the relationship foundered through a mixture of Rose&#x27;s over-possessiveness and Grainger&#x27;s indecision.

== Career maturity ==
=== Departure for America ===

In April 1914 Grainger gave his first performance of Delius&#x27;s piano concerto, at a music festival in Torquay. Thomas Beecham, who was one of the festival&#x27;s guest conductors, reported to Delius that &quot;Percy was good in the &quot;forte&quot; passages, but made far too much noise in the quieter bits&quot;. Grainger was receiving increasing recognition as a composer; leading musicians and orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires. His decision to leave England for America in early September 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British friends. Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was &quot;to give mother a change&quot; – she had been unwell for years. However, according to Bird, Grainger often explained that his reason for leaving London was that &quot;he wanted to emerge as Australia&#x27;s first composer of worth, and to have laid himself open to the possibility of being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice, and told him not to expect a welcome in England after the war, words that hurt Grainger deeply.

Grainger&#x27;s first American tour began on 11 February 1915 with a recital at New York&#x27;s Aeolian Hall. He played works by Bach, Brahms, Handel and Chopin alongside two of his own compositions: &quot;Colonial Song&quot; and &quot;Mock Morris&quot;. In July 1915 Grainger formally registered his intention to apply for US citizenship. Over the next two years his engagements included concerts with Melba in Boston and Pittsburgh and a command performance before President Woodrow Wilson. In addition to his concert performances, Grainger secured a contract with Duo-Art for making pianola rolls, and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records.

In April 1917 Grainger received news of his father&#x27;s death in Perth. On 9 June 1917, after America&#x27;s entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in the US Army with the military band of the 15th Coast Artillery in Fort Hamilton. He had joined as a saxophonist, though he records learning the oboe: &quot;I long for the time when I can blow my oboe well enough to play in the band&quot;. In his 18 months&#x27; service, Grainger made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. As a regular encore he began to play a piano setting of the tune &quot;Country Gardens&quot;. The piece became instantly popular; sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records. The work was to become synonymous with Grainger&#x27;s name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it. On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.

=== Career zenith ===
After leaving the army in January 1919, Grainger refused an offer to become conductor of the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra and resumed his career as a concert pianist. He was soon performing around 120 concerts a year, generally to great critical acclaim, and in April 1921 reached a wider audience by performing in a cinema, New York&#x27;s Capitol Theatre. Grainger commented that the huge audiences at these cinema concerts often showed greater appreciation for his playing than those at established concert venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Aeolian. In the summer of 1919 he led a course in piano technique at Chicago Musical College, the first of many such educational duties he would undertake in later years.

Amid his concert and teaching duties, Grainger found time to re-score many of his works (a habit he continued throughout his life) and also to compose new pieces: his &quot;Children&#x27;s March: Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, and the orchestral version of &quot;The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart&quot; both originated in this period. He also began to develop the technique of elastic scoring, a form of flexible orchestration which enabled works to be performed by different numbers of players and instrument types, from small chamber groups up to full orchestral strength.
In April 1921 Grainger moved with his mother to a large house in White Plains, New York in what is now known as the Percy Grainger Home and Studio. This was his home for the remainder of his life. From the beginning of 1922 Rose&#x27;s health deteriorated sharply; she was suffering from delusions and nightmares, and became fearful that her illness would harm her son&#x27;s career. Because of the closeness of the bond between the two, there had long been rumours that their relationship was incestuous; in April 1922 Rose was directly challenged over this issue by her friend Lotta Hough. From her last letter to Grainger, dated 29 April, it seems that this confrontation unbalanced Rose; on 30 April, while Grainger was touring on the West Coast, she jumped to her death from an office window on the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City. The letter, which began &quot;I am out of my mind and cannot think properly&quot;, asked Grainger if he had ever spoken to Lotta of &quot;improper love&quot;. She signed the letter: &quot;Your poor insane mother&quot;.

=== Inter-war years ===
==== European Travels ====

After Rose&#x27;s funeral, Grainger sought solace in a return to work. In autumn 1922 he left for a year-long trip to Europe, where he collected and recorded Danish folk songs before a concert tour that took him to Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and England. In Norway he stayed with Delius at the latter&#x27;s summer home. Delius was by now almost blind; Grainger helped fulfill his friend&#x27;s wish to see a Norwegian sunset by carrying him (with some assistance) to the top of a nearby mountain peak. He returned to White Plains in August 1923.

Although now less committed to a year-round schedule of concerts, Grainger remained a very popular performer. His eccentricities, often exaggerated for publicity reasons, reportedly included running into auditoriums in gym kit and leaping over the piano to create a grand entrance. In 1924, Grainger became a vegetarian, although he hated vegetables; his diet comprised primarily dairy, pastry, fruit, and nuts.

While he continued to revise and re-score his compositions, he increasingly worked on arrangements of music by other composers, in particular works by Bach, Brahms, Fauré and Delius. Away from music, Grainger&#x27;s preoccupation with Nordic culture led him to develop a form of English which, he maintained, reflected the character of the language before the Norman conquest. Words of Norman or Latin origin were replaced by supposedly Nordic word-forms, such as &quot;blend-band&quot; (orchestra), &quot;forthspeaker&quot; (lecturer) and &quot;writ-piece&quot; (article). He called this &quot;blue-eyed&quot; English. His convictions of Nordic superiority eventually led Grainger, in letters to friends, to express his views in crudely racial and anti-Semitic terms; the music historian David Pear describes Grainger as, &quot;at root, a racial bigot of no small order&quot;.

Grainger made further trips to Europe in 1925 and 1927, collecting more Danish folk music with the aid of the octogenarian ethnologist Evald Tang Kristensen; this work formed the basis of the &quot;Suite on Danish Folksongs&quot; of 1928–30. He also visited Australia and New Zealand, in 1924 and again in 1926.

==== Marriage ====
In November 1926, while returning to America, he met Ella Ström, a Swedish-born artist and poet, with whom he developed a close friendship. On arrival in America the pair separated, but were reunited in England the following autumn after Grainger&#x27;s final folk-song expedition to Denmark. In October 1927 the couple agreed to marry. Ella had a daughter, Elsie, who had been born out of wedlock in 1909. Grainger always acknowledged her as a family member, and developed a warm personal relationship with her.

Although Bird asserts that before her marriage, Ella knew nothing of Grainger&#x27;s sado-masochistic interests, in a letter dated 23 April 1928 (four months before the wedding) Grainger writes to her: &quot;As far as my taste goes, blows [with the whip] are most thrilling on breasts, bottom, inner thighs, sexparts.&quot; He later adds, &quot;I shall thoroly thoroly understand if you cannot in any way see yr way to follow up this hot wish of mine.&quot;

The couple were married on 9 August 1928 at the Hollywood Bowl, at the end of a concert which, in honour of the bride, had included the first performance of Grainger&#x27;s bridal song &quot;To a Nordic Princess&quot;.

==== Educator ====
From the late 1920s and early 1930s Grainger became involved increasingly with educational work in schools and colleges, and in late 1931 accepted a year&#x27;s appointment for 1932–33 as professor of music at New York University (NYU). In this role he delivered a series of lectures under the heading &quot;A General Study of the Manifold Nature of Music&quot;, which introduced his students to a wide range of ancient and modern works. On 25 October 1932 his lecture was illustrated by Duke Ellington and his band, who appeared in person; Grainger admired Ellington&#x27;s music, seeing harmonic similarities with Delius. On the whole, however, Grainger did not enjoy his tenure at NYU; he disliked the institutional formality, and found the university generally unreceptive to his ideas. Despite many offers he never accepted another formal academic appointment, and refused all offers of honorary degrees. His New York lectures became the basis for a series of radio talks which he gave for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1934–35; these were later summarised and published as &quot;Music: A Commonsense View of All Types&quot;. In 1937 Grainger began an association with the Interlochen National Music Camp, and taught regularly at its summer schools until 1944.

==== Innovator ====
The idea of establishing a Grainger Museum in Australia had first occurred to Grainger in 1932. He began collecting and recovering from friends letters and artefacts, even those demonstrating the most private aspects of his life, such as whips, bloodstained shirts and revealing photographs. In September 1933 he and Ella went to Australia to begin supervising the building work. To finance the project, Grainger embarked on a series of concerts and broadcasts, in which he subjected his audiences to a vast range of the world&#x27;s music in accordance with his &quot;universalist&quot; view. Controversially, he argued for the superior achievements of Nordic composers over traditionally recognised masters such as Mozart and Beethoven.

Among various new ideas, Grainger introduced his so-called &quot;free-music&quot; theories. He believed that conformity with the traditional rules of set scales, rhythms and harmonic procedures amounted to &quot;absurd goose-stepping&quot;, from which music should be set free. He demonstrated two experimental compositions of free music, performed initially by a string quartet and later by the use of electronic theremins. He believed that ideally, free music required non-human performance, and spent much of his later life developing machines to realise this vision.

While the building of the museum proceeded, the Graingers visited England for several months in 1936, during which Grainger made his first BBC broadcast. In this, he conducted &quot;Love Verses from &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;&quot; in which the tenor soloist was the then unknown Peter Pears. After spending 1937 in America, Grainger returned to Melbourne in 1938 for the official opening of the Museum; among those present at the ceremony was his old piano teacher Adelaide Burkitt. The museum did not open to the general public during Grainger&#x27;s lifetime, but was available to scholars for research.

In the late 1930s Grainger spent much time arranging his works in settings for wind bands. He wrote &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; for the March 1937 convention of the American Band Masters&#x27; Association in Milwaukee, and in 1939, on his last visit to England before the Second World War, he composed &quot;The Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s Fanfare&quot;, giving it the subtitle &quot;British War Mood Grows&quot;.

== Later career ==
=== Second World War ===
The outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 curtailed Grainger&#x27;s overseas travelling. In the autumn of 1940, alarmed that the war might precipitate an invasion of the United States eastern seaboard, he and Ella moved to Springfield, Missouri, in the centre of the continent. From 1940 Grainger played regularly in charity concerts, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war in December 1941; the historian Robert Simon calculates that Grainger made a total of 274 charity appearances during the war years, many of them at Army and Air Force camps. In 1942 a collection of his Kipling settings, the &quot;Jungle Book&quot; cycle, was performed in eight cities by the band of the Gustavus Adolphus College from St. Peter, Minnesota.

=== Postwar decline ===
Exhausted from his wartime concerts routine, Grainger spent much of 1946 on holiday in Europe. He was suffering a sense of career failure; in 1947, when refusing the Chair of Music at Adelaide University, he wrote: &quot;If I were 40 years younger, and not so crushed by defeat in every branch of music I have essayed, I am sure I would have welcomed such a chance&quot;. In January 1948 he conducted the premiere of his wind band setting of &quot;The Power of Rome and the Christian Heart&quot;, written for the Goldman Band to celebrate the 70th birthday of its founder. Afterward, Grainger denigrated his own music as &quot;commonplace&quot; while praising Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Suite Française&quot;, with which it had shared the programme.
On 10 August 1948, Grainger appeared at the London Proms, playing the piano part in his &quot;Suite on Danish Folksongs&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra under Basil Cameron. On 18 September he attended the Last Night of the Proms, standing in the promenade section for Delius&#x27;s &quot;Brigg Fair&quot;. Over the next few years several friends died: Gardiner in 1950, Quilter and Karen Holten in 1953. In October 1953 Grainger was operated on for abdominal cancer; his fight against this disease would last for the rest of his life. He continued to appear at concerts, often performed in church halls and educational establishments rather than major concert venues.

In 1954, after his last Carnegie Hall appearance, Grainger&#x27;s long promotion of Grieg&#x27;s music was recognised when he was awarded the St. Olav Medal by King Haakon of Norway. But he expressed a growing bitterness in his writings and correspondence; in a letter to the Danish composer Herman Sandby, a lifelong friend, he bemoaned the continuing ascendency in music of the &quot;German form&quot;, and asserted that &quot;all my compositional life I have been a leader without followers&quot;.

After 1950 Grainger virtually ceased to compose. His principal creative activity in the last decade of his life was his work with Burnett Cross, a young physics teacher, on free music machines. The first of these was a relatively simple device controlled by an adapted pianola. Next was the &quot;Estey-reed tone-tool&quot;, a form of giant harmonica which, Grainger expectantly informed his stepdaughter Elsie in April 1951, would be ready to play free music &quot;in a few weeks&quot;. A third machine, the &quot;Cross-Grainger Kangaroo-pouch&quot;, was completed by 1952. Developments in transistor technology encouraged Grainger and Cross to begin work on a fourth, entirely electronic machine, which was incomplete when Grainger died.

In September 1955 Grainger made his final visit to Australia, where he spent nine months organising and arranging exhibits for the Grainger Museum. He refused to consider a &quot;Grainger Festival&quot;, as suggested by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because he felt that his homeland had rejected him and his music. Before leaving Melbourne, he deposited in a bank a parcel that contained an essay and photographs related to his sex life, not to be opened until 10 years after his death.

=== Last years ===
By 1957 Grainger&#x27;s physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC &quot;Concert Hour&quot; programme when he played &quot;Handel in the Strand&quot; on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten&#x27;s Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton &quot;for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum&quot;. This wish was not carried out.
Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, &quot;a fiasco&quot;. Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott&#x27;s early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: &quot;I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.&quot;

Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78. His remains were buried in the Aldridge family vault in the West Terrace Cemetery, alongside Rose&#x27;s ashes. Ella survived him by 18 years; in 1972, aged 83, she married a young archivist, Stewart Manville. She died at White Plains on 17 July 1979.

== Music ==
Grainger&#x27;s own works fall into two categories: original compositions and folk music arrangements. Besides these, he wrote many settings of other composers&#x27; works. Despite his conservatory training, he rebelled against the disciplines of the central European tradition, largely rejecting conventional forms such as symphony, sonata, concerto, and opera. With few exceptions, his original compositions are miniatures, lasting between two and eight minutes. Only a few of his works originated as piano pieces, though in due course almost all of them were, in his phrase, &quot;dished up&quot; in piano versions.

The conductor John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as &quot;a true original in terms of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation&quot;, whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century Second Viennese School and the Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries. Malcolm Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of Grainger&#x27;s style that &quot;you know it is &#x27;Grainger&#x27; when you have heard about one second of a piece&quot;. The music&#x27;s most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture – &quot;the weft of the fabric&quot;, according to Grainger. Different textures are defined by Grainger as &quot;smooth&quot;, &quot;grained&quot; and &quot;prickly&quot;.

Grainger was a musical democrat; he believed that in a performance each player&#x27;s role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger&#x27;s earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were employed in &quot;Love Verses from &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;&quot; (1899), and &quot;Train Music&quot; (1901), long before Stravinsky adopted this practice. In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, harmoniums, banjos, and ukuleles. In one early concert of folk music, Quilter and Scott were conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts. In &quot;Random Round&quot; (1912–14), inspired by the communal music-making he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations. This experiment in aleatoric composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.

The brief &quot;Sea Song&quot; of 1907 was an early attempt by Grainger to write &quot;beatless&quot; music. This work, initially set over 14 irregular bars and occupying about 15 seconds of performing time, was a forerunner of Grainger&#x27;s free-music experiments of the 1930s. Grainger wrote: &quot;It seems to me absurd to live in an age of flying, and yet not be able to execute tonal glides and curves.&quot; The idea of tonal freedom, he said, had been in his head since as a boy of eleven or twelve he had observed the wave-movements in the sea. &quot;Out in nature we hear all kinds of lovely and touching &quot;free&quot; (non-harmonic) combinations of tones; yet we are unable to take up these beauties… into the art of music because of our archaic notions of harmony.&quot; In a 1941 letter to Scott, Grainger acknowledged that he had failed to produce any large-scale works in the manner of a Bach oratorio, a Wagner opera, or a Brahms symphony, but excused this failure on the grounds that all his works before the mid-1930s had been mere preparations for his free music.

As a student, Grainger had learned to appreciate the music of Grieg and came to regard the Norwegian as a paragon of Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, &quot;quite different from Elgar, very original&quot;. After a lifetime interpreting Grieg&#x27;s works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian&#x27;s E minor Piano Sonata, Op. 7 as a &quot;Grieg-Grainger Symphony&quot;, but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged that he had not fulfilled Grieg&#x27;s high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also reflected on whether it would have been better, from the point of view of his development as a composer, had he never met the Griegs, &quot;sweet and dear though they were to me&quot;.

Grainger was known for his musical experimentation and did not hesitate to exploit the capabilities of the orchestra. One early ambitious work was &quot;The Warriors&quot; (1913–16), an 18-minute orchestral piece, subtitled &quot;Music to an Imaginary Ballet&quot;, which he dedicated to Delius. The music, which mixes elements of other Grainger works with references to Arnold Bax, Arnold Schoenberg and Richard Strauss, requires a huge orchestral ensemble alongside at least three pianos – in one performance, Grainger used nineteen pianos with thirty pianists – to be played by &quot;exceptionally strong vigorous players&quot;. Critics were undecided as to whether the work was &quot;magnificent&quot;, or merely &quot;a magnificent failure&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Grainger considered himself an Australian composer who, he said, wrote music &quot;in the hopes of bringing honor and fame to my native land&quot;. However, much of Grainger&#x27;s working life was spent elsewhere, and the extent to which he influenced Australian music, within his lifetime and thereafter, is debatable. His efforts to educate the Australian musical public in the mid-1930s were indifferently received, and did not attract disciples; writing in 2010, the academic and critic Roger Covell identifies only one significant contemporary Australian musician – the English-born horn player, pianist and conductor David Stanhope – working in the Grainger idiom. In 1956, the suggestion by the composer Keith Humble that Grainger be invited to write music for the opening of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne was rejected by the organisers of the Games. A &quot;Percy Grainger Festival&quot; was held in London in 1970, organised by Australian expatriates Bryan Fairfax and William McKie and supported financially by the Australian government.

Grainger was a life-long atheist and believed he would only endure in the body of work he left behind.
To assist that survival he, with his wife Ella , established the Grainger Museum which she said in Melbourne, which was given little attention before the mid-1970s other than in 1965 in the Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly. At interview, Ella said it was &quot;built with money earned from an ABC concert tour in 1934&quot;; and, that Percy saw it &quot;as a tribute to the city in which he was born in 1882 and also as a key way of preserving the achievements of a new era in English music...&quot;.

It was initially regarded as evidence either of an over-large ego or of extreme eccentricity. Since then the University of Melbourne&#x27;s commitment to the museum has, Covell asserts, &quot;rescued [it] permanently from academic denigration and belittlement&quot;. Its vast quantities of materials have been used to investigate not only Grainger&#x27;s life and works, but those of contemporaries whom Grainger had known: Grieg, Delius, Scott, and others. The Grainger home at 7 Cromwell Place, White Plains, New York, is now the Percy Grainger Library and is a further repository of memorabilia and historic performance material, open to researchers and visitors.

Australian poet Jessica L.Wilkinson &quot;produced a verse biography of the man&quot;, reviewed by another Australian poet Geoff Page.

In Britain, Grainger&#x27;s main legacy is the revival of interest in folk music. His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folk songs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect. After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten declared that these &quot;[knocked] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked hat&quot;. In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music; Timothy Reynish, a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him as &quot;the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras.&quot; Grainger&#x27;s attempts to produce &quot;free music&quot; by mechanical and later electronic means, which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were quickly overtaken and nullified by new technological advances. Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger&#x27;s dogged resourcefulness and ingenious use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer&#x27;s character – one of which Grainger would have been proud.

== Assessment ==
In 1945, Grainger devised an informal ratings system for composers and musical styles, based on criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of 40 composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth – behind Wagner and
Delius, but well ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, in his later years he frequently denigrated his career, for example writing to Scott: &quot;I have never been a true musician or true artist&quot;. His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his popular folk-song arrangements was a source of frustration and disappointment; for years after his death the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed. From the 1990s, an increase in the number of Grainger recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer. An unsigned tribute published on the &quot;Gramophone&quot; website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger&#x27;s death opined that &quot;though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste&quot;.

Of Grainger the pianist, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote that his unique style was expressed with &quot;amazing skill, personality and vigor&quot;. The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances during the final ten years of his life were often harsh. However, Britten regarded Grainger&#x27;s late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at Aarhus in 1957, as &quot;one of the noblest ever committed to record&quot; – despite the suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults. Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring to Grainger&#x27;s early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John Grainger&#x27;s influence not been removed, &quot;Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia&#x27;s leading painters and designers, who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer&quot;. The ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger&#x27;s contribution to social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger&#x27;s musical education had not been &quot;undermined by and the disastrous influence of his mother, I am sure that his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater&quot;.

== Recordings ==
Between 1908 and 1957 Grainger made numerous recordings, usually as pianist or conductor, of his own and other composers&#x27; music. His first recordings, for His Master&#x27;s Voice, included the cadenza to Grieg&#x27;s piano concerto; he did not record a complete version of this work on disc until 1945. Much of his recording work was done between 1917 and 1931, under contract with Columbia. At other times he recorded for Decca (1944–45 and 1957), and Vanguard (1957). Of his own compositions and arrangements, &quot;Country Gardens&quot;, &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Hey&quot; and &quot;Molly on the Shore&quot; and &quot;Lincolnshire Posy&quot; were recorded most frequently; in recordings of other composers, piano works by Bach, Brahms, Chopin, Grieg, Liszt and Schumann figure most often. Grainger&#x27;s complete 78 rpm solo piano recordings are now available on compact disc as a CD box set.

During his association with the Duo-Art company between 1915 and 1932, Grainger made around 80 piano rolls of his own and others&#x27; music using a wooden robot designed to play a concert grand piano via an array of precision mechanical fingers and feet; replayings of many of these rolls have subsequently been recorded on to compact disc (CD). This reproduction system allowed Grainger to make a posthumous appearance in the Albert Hall, London, during the 1988 last night of the Proms as soloist with the BBC Symphony Orchestra in Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto.

Since Grainger&#x27;s death, recordings of his works have been undertaken by many artists and issued under many different labels. In 1995, Chandos Records began to compile a complete recorded edition of Grainger&#x27;s original compositions and folk settings. Of 25 anticipated volumes, 19 had been completed as of 2010; these were issued as a CD boxed set in 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death. A reissue of this along with two extra CDs was released in January 2021 to mark the 60th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death.

<text>A galvanic cell or voltaic cell, named after the scientists Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, respectively, is an electrochemical cell in which an electric current is generated from spontaneous oxidation–reduction reactions. An example of a galvanic cell consists of two different metals, each immersed in separate beakers containing their respective metal ions in solution that are connected by a salt bridge or separated by a porous membrane.

Volta was the inventor of the voltaic pile, the first electrical battery. Common usage of the word &quot;battery&quot; has evolved to include a single Galvanic cell, but the first batteries had many Galvanic cells.

== History ==

In 1780, Luigi Galvani discovered that when two different metals (e.g., copper and zinc) are in contact and then both are touched at the same time to two different parts of a muscle of a frog leg, to close the circuit, the frog&#x27;s leg contracts. He called this &quot;animal electricity&quot;. The frog&#x27;s leg, as well as being a detector of electrical current, was also the electrolyte (to use the language of modern chemistry).

A year after Galvani published his work (1790), Alessandro Volta showed that the frog was not necessary, using instead a force-based detector and brine-soaked paper (as electrolyte). (Earlier Volta had established the law of capacitance with force-based detectors). In 1799 Volta invented the voltaic pile, which is a stack of galvanic cells each consisting of a metal disk, an electrolyte layer, and a disk of a different metal. He built it entirely out of non-biological material to challenge Galvani&#x27;s (and the later experimenter Leopoldo Nobili)&#x27;s animal electricity theory in favor of his own metal-metal contact electricity theory. Carlo Matteucci in his turn constructed a battery entirely out of biological material in answer to Volta. Volta&#x27;s contact electricity view characterized each electrode with a number that we would now call the work function of the electrode. This view ignored the chemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces, which include H2 formation on the more noble metal in Volta&#x27;s pile.

Although Volta did not understand the operation of the battery or the galvanic cell, these discoveries paved the way for electrical batteries; Volta&#x27;s cell was named an IEEE Milestone in 1999.

Some forty years later, Faraday (see Faraday&#x27;s laws of electrolysis) showed that the galvanic cell—now often called a voltaic cell—was chemical in nature. Faraday introduced new terminology to the language of chemistry: electrode (cathode and anode), electrolyte, and ion (cation and anion). Thus Galvani incorrectly thought the source of electricity (or source of electromotive force (emf), or seat of emf) was in the animal, Volta incorrectly thought it was in the physical properties of the isolated electrodes, but Faraday correctly identified the source of emf as the chemical reactions at the two electrode-electrolyte interfaces. The authoritative work on the intellectual history of the voltaic cell remains that by Ostwald.

It was suggested by Wilhelm König in 1940 that the object known as the Baghdad battery might represent galvanic cell technology from ancient Parthia. Replicas filled with citric acid or grape juice have been shown to produce a voltage. However, it is far from certain that this was its purpose—other scholars have pointed out that it is very similar to vessels known to have been used for storing parchment scrolls.

== Principles ==
Galvanic cells are extensions of spontaneous redox reactions, but have been merely designed to harness the energy produced from said reaction. For example, when one immerses a strip of zinc metal (Zn) in an aqueous solution of copper sulfate (CuSO), dark-colored solid deposits will collect on the surface of the zinc metal and the blue color characteristic of the Cu ion disappears from the solution. The depositions on the surface of the zinc metal consist of copper metal, and the solution now contains zinc ions. This reaction is represented by

: Zn + Cu Zn + Cu

In this redox reaction, Zn is oxidized to Zn and Cu is reduced to Cu. When electrons are transferred directly from Zn to Cu, the enthalpy of reaction is lost to the surroundings as heat. However, the same reaction can be carried out in a galvanic cell, allowing some of the chemical energy released to be converted into electrical energy. In its simplest form, a half-cell consists of a solid metal (called an electrode) that is submerged in a solution; the solution contains cations (+) of the electrode metal and anions (−) to balance the charge of the cations. The full cell consists of two half-cells, usually connected by a semi-permeable membrane or by a salt bridge that prevents the ions of the more noble metal from plating out at the other electrode.

A specific example is the Daniell cell (see figure), with a zinc (Zn) half-cell containing a solution of ZnSO4 (zinc sulfate) and a copper (Cu) half-cell containing a solution of CuSO4 (copper sulfate). A salt bridge is used here to complete the electric circuit.

If an external electrical conductor connects the copper and zinc electrodes, zinc from the zinc electrode dissolves into the solution as Zn++ ions (oxidation), releasing electrons that enter the external conductor. To compensate for the increased zinc ion concentration, via the salt bridge zinc ions (cations) leave and sulfate ions (anions) enter the zinc half-cell. In the copper half-cell, the copper ions plate onto the copper electrode (reduction), taking up electrons that leave the external conductor. Since the Cu++ ions (cations) plate onto the copper electrode, the latter is called the cathode. Correspondingly the zinc electrode is the anode. The electrochemical reaction is

: &lt;chem&gt; Zn_\mathsf{(s)}\ +\ Cu^{++}_\mathsf{(aq)}\ -&gt;\ Zn^{++}_\mathsf{(aq)}\ +\ Cu_\mathsf{(s)}&lt;/chem&gt;

This is the same reaction as given in the previous example. In addition, electrons flow through the external conductor, which is the primary application of the galvanic cell.

As discussed under cell voltage, the electromotive force of the cell is the difference of the half-cell potentials, a measure of the relative ease of dissolution of the two electrodes into the electrolyte. The emf depends on both the electrodes and on the electrolyte, an indication that the emf is chemical in nature.

=== Half reactions and conventions ===

A half-cell contains a metal in two oxidation states. Inside an isolated half-cell, there is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction that is in chemical equilibrium, a condition written symbolically as follows (here, &quot;M&quot; represents a metal cation, an atom that has a charge imbalance due to the loss of electrons):

: M + e− M

A galvanic cell consists of two half-cells, such that the electrode of one half-cell is composed of metal A, and the electrode of the other half-cell is composed of metal B; the redox reactions for the two separate half-cells are thus:

: A + + e− A
: B + + e− B

The overall balanced reaction is:

: A + B + B + A +

In other words, the metal atoms of one half-cell are oxidized while the metal cations of the other half-cell are reduced. By separating the metals in two half-cells, their reaction can be controlled in a way that forces transfer of electrons through the external circuit where they can do useful work.

* The electrodes are connected with a metal wire in order to conduct the electrons that participate in the reaction.

In one half-cell, dissolved metal B cations combine with the free electrons that are available at the interface between the solution and the metal B electrode; these cations are thereby neutralized, causing them to precipitate from solution as deposits on the metal B electrode, a process known as plating.

This reduction reaction causes the free electrons throughout the metal B electrode, the wire, and the metal A electrode to be pulled into the metal B electrode. Consequently, electrons are wrestled away from some of the atoms of the metal A electrode, as though the metal B cations were reacting directly with them; those metal A atoms become cations that dissolve into the surrounding solution.

As this reaction continues, the half-cell with the metal A electrode develops a positively charged solution (because the metal A cations dissolve into it), while the other half-cell develops a negatively charged solution (because the metal B cations precipitate out of it, leaving behind the anions); unabated, this imbalance in charge would stop the reaction. The solutions of the half-cells are connected by a salt bridge or a porous plate that allows ions to pass from one solution to the other, which balances the charges of the solutions and allows the reaction to continue.

By definition:

* The anode is the electrode where oxidation (loss of electrons) takes place (metal A electrode); in a galvanic cell, it is the negative electrode, because when oxidation occurs, electrons are left behind on the electrode. These electrons then flow through the external circuit to the cathode (positive electrode) (while in electrolysis, an electric current drives electron flow in the opposite direction and the anode is the positive electrode).

* The cathode is the electrode where reduction (gain of electrons) takes place (metal B electrode); in a galvanic cell, it is the positive electrode, as ions get reduced by taking up electrons from the electrode and plate out (while in electrolysis, the cathode is the negative terminal and attracts positive ions from the solution). In both cases, the statement &#x27;the cathode attracts cations&#x27; is true.

By their nature, galvanic cells produce direct current. 

The &quot;Weston cell&quot; has an anode composed of cadmium mercury amalgam, and a cathode composed of pure mercury. The electrolyte is a (saturated) solution of cadmium sulfate. The depolarizer is a paste of mercurous sulfate. When the electrolyte solution is saturated, the voltage of the cell is very reproducible; hence, in 1911, it was adopted as an international standard for voltage.

* In the strictest sense, a &quot;battery&quot; is a set of two or more galvanic cells that are connected in series to form a single source of voltage.

For instance, a typical 12 V lead–acid battery has six galvanic cells connected in series, with the anodes composed of lead and cathodes composed of lead dioxide, both immersed in sulfuric acid.

Large central office battery rooms – in a telephone exchange to provide power for subscribers&#x27; land-line telephones, for instance – may have many cells, connected both in series and parallel: Individual cells are connected in series as a &quot;battery&quot; of cells with some standard voltage (), and &quot;banks&quot; of such serial batteries, themselves connected in parallel, to provide adequate amperage to supply a typical peak demand for telephone connections.

=== Cell voltage ===

The voltage (electromotive force ) produced by a galvanic cell can be estimated from the standard Gibbs free energy change in the electrochemical reaction according to:

formula_1

where is the number of electrons transferred in the balanced half reactions, and is Faraday&#x27;s constant. However, it can be determined more conveniently by the use of a standard potential table for the two half cells involved. The first step is to identify the two metals and their ions reacting in the cell. Then one looks up the standard electrode potential, o, in volts, for each of the two half reactions. The standard potential of the cell is equal to the more positive o value minus the more negative o value.

For example, in the figure above the solutions are CuSO4 and ZnSO4. Each solution has a corresponding metal strip in it, and a salt bridge or porous disk connecting the two solutions and allowing ions to flow freely between the copper and zinc solutions. To calculate the standard potential one looks up copper and zinc&#x27;s half reactions and finds:

: Cu++ + 2 Cu : o = +0.34 V
: Zn++ + 2 Zn : o = −0.76 V

Thus the overall reaction is:

: Cu++ + Zn Cu + Zn++

The standard potential for the reaction is then The polarity of the cell is determined as follows. Zinc metal is more strongly reducing than copper metal because the standard (reduction) potential for zinc is more negative than that of copper. Thus, zinc metal will lose electrons to copper ions and develop a positive electrical charge. The equilibrium constant, , for the cell is given by:

formula_2

where
: is the Faraday constant,
: is the gas constant, and
: is the absolute temperature in Kelvins.
For the Daniell cell Thus, at equilibrium, a few electrons are transferred, enough to cause the electrodes to be charged.

Actual half-cell potentials must be calculated by using the Nernst equation as the solutes are unlikely to be in their standard states:

formula_3

where is the reaction quotient. When the charges of the ions in the reaction are equal, this simplifies to:

formula_4

where M is the activity of the metal ion in solution. In practice concentration in is used in place of activity. The metal electrode is in its standard state so by definition has unit activity. The potential of the whole cell is obtained as the difference between the potentials for the two half-cells, so it depends on the concentrations of both dissolved metal ions. If the concentrations are the same the Nernst equation is not needed, and formula_5 under the conditions assumed here.

The value of is so at 25 °C (298.15 K) the half-cell potential will change by only if the concentration of a metal ion is increased or decreased by a 

formula_6

These calculations are based on the assumption that all chemical reactions are in equilibrium. When a current flows in the circuit, equilibrium conditions are not achieved and the cell voltage will usually be reduced by various mechanisms, such as the development of overpotentials. Also, since chemical reactions occur when the cell is producing power, the electrolyte concentrations change and the cell voltage is reduced. A consequence of the temperature dependency of standard potentials is that the voltage produced by a galvanic cell is also temperature dependent.

== Galvanic corrosion ==
Galvanic corrosion is the electrochemical erosion of metals. Corrosion occurs when two dissimilar metals are in contact with each other in the presence of an electrolyte, such as salt water. This forms a galvanic cell, with hydrogen gas forming on the more noble (less active) metal. The resulting electrochemical potential then develops an electric current that electrolytically dissolves the less noble material. A concentration cell can be formed if the same metal is exposed to two different concentrations of electrolyte.

<doc id="254515" wikidata="Q290691" url="?curid=254515" title="Villain">
<text>A villain (also known as a &quot;&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot;; the feminine form is villainess) is a stock character, whether based on a historical narrative or one of literary fiction. &quot;Random House Unabridged Dictionary&quot; defines such a character as &quot;a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime; scoundrel; or a character in a play, novel, or the like, who constitutes an important evil in the plot&quot;. The antonym of a villain is a hero.

The villain&#x27;s structural purpose is to serve as the opposite to the hero character, and their motives or evil actions drive a plot along. In contrast to the hero, who is defined by feats of ingenuity and bravery and the pursuit of justice and the greater good, a villain is often defined by their acts of selfishness, evilness, arrogance, cruelty, and , displaying immoral behavior that can oppose or pervert justice.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;villain&quot; first came into English from the Anglo-French and Old French &quot;vilain&quot;, which in turn derives from the Late Latin word &quot;villanus&quot;. This refers to those bound to the soil of the villa, who worked on the equivalent of a modern estate in Late Antiquity, in Italy or Gaul.

&quot;Vilain&quot; later shifted to &quot;villein&quot;, which referred to a person of less than knightly status, implying a lack of chivalry and courtesy. All actions that were unchivalrous or evil (such as treachery or rape) eventually became part of the identity of a villain in the modern sense of the word. Additionally, &quot;villein&quot; came into use as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning.

The landed aristocracy of mediaeval Europe used politically and linguistically the Middle English descendant of &quot;villanus&quot; meaning &quot;villager&quot; (styled as &quot;vilain&quot; or &quot;vilein&quot;) with the meaning &quot;a person of uncouth mind and manners&quot;. As the common equating of manners with morals gained in strength and currency, the connotations worsened, so that the modern word &quot;villain&quot; is no unpolished villager but is instead (among other things) a deliberate scoundrel or criminal.

At the same time, the mediaeval expression &quot;vilein&quot; or &quot;vilain&quot; is closely influenced by the word &quot;vile&quot;, referring to something wicked or worthless.
As from the late 13th century, &quot;vile&quot; meant &quot;morally repugnant; morally flawed, corrupt, wicked; of no value; of inferior quality; disgusting, foul, ugly; degrading, humiliating; of low estate, without worldly honor or esteem&quot;, from Anglo-French &quot;ville&quot;, Old French &quot;vil&quot;, from Latin &quot;vilis&quot; &quot;cheap, worthless, of low value&quot;.

==Classical literature==
In classical literature, the villain character is not always the same as those that appear in modern and postmodern incarnations, as the lines of morality are often blurred to imply a sense of ambiguity or affected by historical context and cultural ideas. Often the delineation of heroes and villains in such literature is left unclear. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions to this such as Grendel from Beowulf who is unambiguously evil.

William Shakespeare modelled his archetypical villains as three-dimensional characters and acknowledged the complex nature that villains display in modern literature. For instance, he made Shylock a sympathetic character. However, Shakespeare&#x27;s incarnations of historical figures were influenced by the propaganda pieces coming from Tudor sources, and his works often showed this bias and discredited their reputation. For example, Shakespeare famously portrayed Richard III as a hideous monster who destroyed his family out of spite. Shakespeare also ensured that Iago in Othello and Antonio in The Tempest were completely void of redeeming traits.

==Folk and fairy tales==
===Russian fairy tales===
In an analysis of Russian fairy tales, Vladimir Propp concluded that the majority of stories had only eight &quot;dramatis personae&quot;, one being the villain. This analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian tales. The actions within a villain&#x27;s sphere were:
* a story-initiating villainy, where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family
* a conflict between the hero and the villain, either a fight or other competition
* pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain

When a character displays these traits, it is not necessarily tropes specific to the fairy tale genre, but it does imply that the one who performs certain acts to be the villain. The villain, therefore, can appear twice in a story to fulfill certain roles: once in the opening of the story, and a second time as the person sought out by the hero.

When a character has only performed actions or displayed traits that coincide with Vladimir Propp&#x27;s analysis, that character can be identified as a pure villain. Folklore and fairy tale villains can also play a myriad of roles that can influence or propel a story forward. In fairy tales, villains can perform an influential role; for example, a witch who fought the hero and ran away, and who lets the hero follow her, is also performing the task of &quot;guidance&quot; and thus acting as a helper.

Propp also proposed another two archetypes of the villain&#x27;s role within the narrative, in which they can portray themselves as villainous in a more general sense. The first is the false hero: This character is always villainous, presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending. Examples of characters who display this trait, and interfere with the success of a tale&#x27;s hero, are the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella who chopped off parts of their feet to fit in the shoe.

Another role for the villain would be the dispatcher, who sends the hero on their quest. At the beginning of the story, their request may appear benevolent or innocent, but the dispatcher&#x27;s real intentions might be to send the hero on a journey in the hopes of being rid of them.

The roles and influence that villains can have over a narrative can also be transferred to other characters – to continue their role in the narrative through another character. The legacy of the villain is often transferred through that of bloodlines (family) or a devoted follower. For example, if a dragon played the role of a villain but was killed by the hero, another character (such as the dragon&#x27;s sister) might take on the legacy of the previous villain and pursue the hero out of revenge.

===Villain archetypes===
The fairy tale genre utilises villains as key components to push the narrative forward and influence the hero&#x27;s journey. These, while not as rounded as those that appear in other forms of literature, are what is known as archetypes. The archetypal villain is a common occurrence within the genre and come under different categories that have different influences on the protagonist and the narrative. 

====False donor====
The false donor is a villain who utilises trickery to achieve their ends. Often the false donor will pose as a benevolent figure or influence on the protagonist (or those associated with them) to present them with a deal. The deal will present a short-term solution or benefit for whoever accepts it and, in return, benefit the villain in the long term. During the story&#x27;s climax, the hero often has to find a way to rectify the agreement in order to defeat the villain or achieve the happy ending. 

Similarly, the devil archetype is one that also makes an offer to the protagonist (or someone associated with them) and appeals to their needs and desires. However, the devil archetype does not hide their intentions from the protagonist. The subsequent story often follows the protagonist&#x27;s journey to try and annul the agreement before any damage can be done. 

====Beast====
The beast is a character who relies on their instincts and ability to cause destruction to achieve their ends. The evil intentions of their actions are often easily identified, as they act without concern for others (or their wellbeing) or subtlety. The rampaging villain can take the form of a very powerful individual or a rampaging beast but is still one of the more dangerous villain archetypes due to their affinity for destruction. 

====Authority figure====
The authority figure is one that has already attained a level of command and power but always craves more. They are often driven by their desire for material wealth, distinguished stature or great power and appear as a monarch, corporate climber or other powerful individual. Their end goal is often the total domination of their corporation, nation, or world through mystical means or political manipulation. Often this villain is defeated by their own greed, pride, or arrogance. 

====Traitor====
The traitor is a villain who emphasizes the traits of trickery, manipulation and deception to achieve their goals, which is often to offer or supply information to the protagonist&#x27;s opposition to halt them on their journey, often in exchange for their own freedom or safety. The traitor&#x27;s goals are not always evil but the actions they commit to reach their goal can be considered inherently evil. 

==Animated villains==
Animation is home to several different villains. Winsor McCay in &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot; had a cartoon mosquito torment a human being and in 1925, Walt Disney created Pete as an antagonist for the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; with Pete later becoming an antagonist of Mickey Mouse and his friends and the first Disney villain. Fleischer Studios later had Bluto as the antagonist of the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons. Hanna-Barbera created Tom as an antagonist of Jerry. Likewise, the Looney Tunes had villains like Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian and Blacque Jacque Shellacque.

In 1937, Disney made the movie &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; and it had the Evil Queen as its antagonist. Since then, Disney made a lot of animated movies with villains based on fairy tale villains. Disney Villains became a major part of that franchise.

Saturday-morning cartoons also had villains like Dick Dastardly, Muttley and Snidely Whiplash. Since then, cartoon villains have had a reputation for being one-dimensional. 

In modern animation, animated villains that are more significant and fleshed out have become increasingly common as cartoons have begun to be favored by adults. Shows such as &quot;Adventure Time&quot;, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; range from child to adult cartoons but are all watched by a largely older audience.

==Animated villain controversies==
It is sometimes alleged that villains in animated works, such as Disney movies, often embody stereotypes in a more direct way than live-action villains. That their character design is based on caricatures of racist, antisemitic, and/or homophobic stereotypes with exaggerated features. That female animated villains are portrayed in ways that feed into misogynistic ideas and traditional gender roles.

===Allegations of misogyny===
Sattar Sharmin and Sanyat Tania have argued that animated villains frequently fall into two categories: women who exhibit societally undesirable traits, or men displaying feminine traits. In the case of men with feminine traits, this may stem from both a homophobic and misogynistic point of view which is further discussed below.

As for female villains who are portrayed with &quot;displeasing&quot; characteristics, not only are they crafted to look unattractive, but their motivations for becoming evil are rooted in very trivial matters. Debra Bradley&#x27;s survey on Disney films discovered that 28% of female villains, such as the evil queen and Lady Tremaine, are influenced by jealousy/vanity whereas only 4% of male villains are driven by these same factors. Rather the men, such as Hades and Captain Hook, have motives grounded in wealth and power, giving in to masculine stereotypes and signifying an attachment to the patriarchy.

Additionally, in animation there is a history of mothers and grandmothers being posed as the villains of many stories. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Coraline&quot; presents this phenomenon through the idea of the Other Mother. In &quot;Coraline&quot;, the Other Mother is a loving, caring parent who welcomes Coraline to a new life, helping in the face of troubles back home. By glorifying this other mother, the story paints Coraline&#x27;s real mother as negligent, in turn causing her to be the villain of the story. Disney films also take on the motherly stereotypes in their villains.

Other female villains are portrayed as hyper-sexual and powerful beings that are used to juxtapose the beauty or physical characteristics of the heroine; for example, the Lady Tremaine and stepsisters in &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Male villains also hold several traits that are characteristically feminine. Characters like Jafar (&quot;Aladdin&quot;) and Hades (&quot;Hercules&quot;) have features such as shaded eyelids and accentuated facial features, similar to those typically associated with femininity.

===Allegations of homophobic stereotypes===
Zachary Doiron has argued that animated villains are based on homophobic stereotypes. As an example, he brings up is effeminate men, sometimes referred to by subject experts as &quot;sissy villains,&quot; where their mannerisms represent stereotypes relating to gay men. Another example is the depiction of masculine women, which emulates drag queens or butch lesbians. Adelia Brown makes a similar allegation about Ursula from &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Ursula is closely modelled after the famous drag queen &quot;Divine&quot; with her heavy makeup, hair styled in a mohawk, and her nails painted bright red. Her goal throughout the film is to become queen and disrupt the coupling of Ariel and Prince Eric, both of which connect villainy to drag queens, suggesting that there is inherent evil in those who do drag.

==Villainous foil==

Villains in fiction commonly function in the dual role of adversary and foil to a story&#x27;s heroes. In their role as an adversary, the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome. In their role as a foil, they exemplify characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero, creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones.

Other have pointed out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish-fulfillment, which makes some readers or viewers identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes. Because of this, a convincing villain must be given a characterization that provides a motive for doing wrong, as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero. As put by film critic Roger Ebert: &quot;Each film is only as good as its villain. Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film, only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph.&quot;

==Portraying and employing villains in fiction==
The actor Tod Slaughter typically portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner, with mustache-twirling, eye-rolling, leering, cackling, and hand-rubbing.

==Villains in film==
In 1895, Thomas Edison and Alfred Clark made &quot;The Execution of Mary Stuart&quot; depicting Mary, Queen of Scots being decapitated. It describes neither Mary nor her executioner as villains (though at the time, it was deemed so realistic that audience members believed an actual woman had been beheaded in the making of that film.) In 1896, Georges Méliès made a horror film titled &quot;The House of the Devil&quot; which had The Devil as an antagonist. Edison&#x27;s &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, released in 1903 had the bandits who rob the train as its villains. In 1909, there was a feature length adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; with Javert as a villain and in 1910, Otis Turner had a Wicked Witch as the villain of a short film adaptation of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In 1914, Lois Weber made a film of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with Phillips Smalley as a villainous Shylock.

The 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; has &quot;Northern carpetbaggers&quot; inciting black violence as its villains. The 1916 film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has a man named Charles Denver as its villain. In the same year, &quot;Snow White&quot; had Queen Brongomar as a villain. The 1923 film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; has the main character&#x27;s brother be a villain due to his commitment to breaking all of the Ten Commandments. In 1937, Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; had the Evil Queen as a villain. In 1939, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; had Wicked Witch of the West as its villain. In the 1940s, serial films about superheroes introduced supervillains as characters like Dr. Dana in &quot;Batman&quot;. The 1949 film &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; has Hedy Lamarr as the villainous Delilah and George Sanders as the villainous Prince of Gaza.

In 1953, Byron Haskin made a film of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Like the book, it has Martians as villains.

Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s 1956 remake of &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; had two main villains. Ramesses II, played by Yul Brynner and Dathan played by Edward G. Robinson. (It also had Nefertari be a Lady Macbeth figure egging Ramesses on.)

In 1960, the film &quot;Spartacus&quot; had Marcus Licinius Crassus as its villain. In the same year, the film &quot;Psycho&quot; had Norman Bates as a villainous protagonist. The 1962 film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, like the book, had Bob Ewell as its villain. Other 1960s films like &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; had Nazis as their villains.

Beginning with &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, every &quot;James Bond&quot; film has had a villain.

There were also villains in 1960s children&#x27;s film. For instance, &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; and the 1966 &quot;Batman&quot; both had villains. The former having Cruella de Vil and the latter being the first time comic book supervillains were adapted to film.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films introduced Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine.

1980s films had villains like Khan in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, John Kreese in &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; and its sequels, Skynet in the &quot;Terminator&quot; films, Biff Tannen in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films, The Joker in Batman and Dark Helmet in &quot;Spaceballs&quot;.

1990s films had villains like General Mandible in &quot;Antz&quot;, Dennis Nedry in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Edgar in &quot;Men in Black&quot;, Van Pelt in &quot;Jumanji&quot;, Rameses in &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, Carrigan in &quot;Casper&quot; and Shan-Yu in &quot;Mulan&quot;. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; prequels also introduced several villains in addition to those the franchise already had.

Early 2000s films like the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, &quot;The Dark Knight Trilogy&quot;, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films and &quot;Avatar&quot; all had villains like, Green Goblin, Two-Face, Lord Voldemort, Saruman and Miles Quaritch.

In the 2010s, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe have had several notable supervillains such as Thanos and General Zod.

==Female villain==

The term villain is the universal term for characters who pose as s for certain ideals that readers or observers find immoral, but the term &quot;villainess&quot; is often used to highlight specific traits that come with their female identity—separating them, in some aspects, from their male counterparts. The use of the female villain (or villainess) is often to highlight the traits that come specifically with the character and the abilities they possess that are exclusive to them. For example, one of the female villain&#x27;s greatest weapons is her alluring beauty, sexuality or emotional intelligence. The perversion of inherently female traits in storytelling also alludes to the demonic display of the succubus and their affinity for utilizing their beauty as a weapon—a trait utilized by many female villains throughout modern fiction and mythology. However, this is not always the case. As seen often in animated films, female villains are portrayed with &quot;ugly&quot; appearances to contrast the beauty of the protagonist, in turn associating unattractiveness with evil. This paints female villains in a negative light compared to their heroine counterparts and showcases the duality of the female villain character.

==Use of the term &quot;villain&quot; to describe historical figures and real-life people==
The ethical dimension of history poses the problem of judging those who acted in the past, and at times, tempts scholars and historians to construct a world of black and white in which the terms &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;villain&quot; are used arbitrary and with the pass of time become interchangeable. These binaries of course are reflected to varying degrees in endless movies, novels, and other fictional and non-fictional narratives.

As processes of globalization connect the world, cultures with different historical trajectories and political traditions will need to find ways to work together not only economically, but also politically. In this evolving framework of globalization, tradition, according to political theorists like Edmund Burke, historical figures perceived and evaluated as either positive or negative become the embodiment of national political cultures that may collude or collide against one another.

The usage of villain to describe a historical figure dates back to Tudor propaganda, pieces of which ended up influencing William Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Richard III as a spiteful and hunchback tyrant.

==Sympathetic villain==
The sympathetic villain or anti-villain is one with the typical traits of a villainous character but differs in their motivations. Their intention to cause chaos or commit evil actions is driven by an ambiguous motivation or is not driven by an intent to cause evil. Their intentions may coincide with the ideals of a greater good, or even a desire to make the world a better place, but their actions are inherently evil in nature. An anti-villain is the opposite of an antihero. While the antihero often fights on the side of good, but with questionable or selfish motives, the anti-villain plays a villain&#x27;s game, but for a noble cause in a way that the audience or other characters can sympathize with. They may be more noble or heroic than an antihero, but the means to achieve their ends are often considered exploitative, immoral, unjust, or simply evil. Characters who fall into this category are often created with the intention of humanizing them, making them more relatable to the reader/viewer by posing the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; behind their motivations rather than simply creating a one-dimensional character. Because of their motives, many of these types of villains are commonly nicknamed &quot;anti-villains&quot;.

American writer Brad Warner has argued that &quot;only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad&quot;. American writer Ben Bova recommends to writers that their works not contain villains. He states, in his &quot;Tips for writers&quot;:In the real world there are no villains. No one actually sets out to do evil . . . Fiction mirrors life. Or, more accurately, fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper, clearer understanding for us. There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds. There are only people with problems, struggling to solve them.

Following up on Bova&#x27;s point, American writer David Lubar adds that the villain &quot;may be driven by greed, neuroses, or the conviction that his cause is just, but he&#x27;s driven by something, not unlike the things that drive a hero.&quot;

<doc id="254518" wikidata="Q136646" url="?curid=254518" title="ZaSu Pitts">
<text>ZaSu Pitts (; January 3, 1894 – June 7, 1963) was an American actress who, in a career spanning nearly five decades, starred in many silent film dramas, such as Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s 1924 epic &quot;Greed&quot;, along with comedies, before
transitioning successfully to mostly comedy roles with the advent of sound films. She also appeared on numerous radio shows and, later, on television. She was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 at 6554 Hollywood Blvd.

==Early life==
ZaSu Pitts was born in Parsons, Kansas, the third of four children of Rulandus and Nelly (&quot;née&quot; Shay) Pitts. Her father, who had lost a leg while serving in the 76th New York Infantry in the Civil War, had settled the family in Kansas before ZaSu&#x27;s birth.

The names of her father&#x27;s sisters, Eliza and Susan, were purportedly the basis for the name &quot;ZaSu&quot;, i.e., to satisfy competing family interests. It has been (incorrectly) spelled as Zazu Pitts in some film credits and news articles. Although the name is commonly mispronounced or , or , in her 1963 book &quot;Candy Hits&quot; (pg. 15), published the year of her death, the actress gave the correct pronunciation as &quot;Say Zoo&quot; , recounting that Mary Pickford had predicted &quot;many will mispronounce it&quot;, and adding, &quot;How right she was.&quot;

In 1903, when Pitts was nine years old, her family moved to Santa Cruz, California, to seek a warmer climate and better job opportunities. Her childhood home at 208 Lincoln Street still stands. She attended Santa Cruz High School, where she participated in school theatricals.

==Career==

Pitts made her stage debut in 1914–15 doing school and local community theater in Santa Cruz. Going to Los Angeles in 1916, at the age of 22, she spent many months seeking work as a film extra. Finally, she was discovered for substantive roles in films by screenwriter Frances Marion, who cast Pitts as an orphaned slavey (child of work) in the silent film &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1917), starring Pickford.

Pitts&#x27;s popularity grew following a series of Universal one-reeler comedies, and earned her first feature-length lead in King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Better Times&quot; (1919). The following year she married her first husband, Tom Gallery, with whom she was paired in several films, including &quot;Heart of Twenty&quot; (1920), &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;, &quot;Patsy&quot; (both 1921) and &quot;A Daughter of Luxury&quot; (1922).
Pitts enjoyed her greatest fame in the early 1930s, often starring in Hal Roach B movies and comedy short films, often cast with Thelma Todd as a pair of trouble-prone &quot;working girls&quot;. She played secondary parts in many films. Her stock persona (a fretful, flustered, worried spinster) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. At Universal she co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she became a specialist in comedy roles.

==Dramatic potential==
Pitts played a tragic role in Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s -hour epic &quot;Greed&quot; (1924). The surprise casting initially shocked Hollywood, but showed that Pitts could draw tears with her doleful demeanor, as well as laughs. Having been extensively edited prior to release — the final theatrical cut ran just over two hours — the movie failed initially at the box office, but has since been restored to over four hours and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Based on her performance, von Stroheim labeled ZaSu Pitts &quot;the greatest dramatic actress.&quot; He also featured her in his films &quot;The Honeymoon&quot; (1928), &quot;The Wedding March&quot; (1928), and &quot;Walking Down Broadway&quot;. Pitts&#x27;s performance in &quot;Walking Down Broadway&quot; was dramatic, with her character showing a repressed romantic interest in her girlfriend; the studio reshot these scenes with Pitts, now playing the girlfriend&#x27;s companion for laughs, and von Stroheim&#x27;s directorial credit was removed from the film. The film was finally released in 1933, much changed, as &quot;Hello, Sister!&quot;.

ZaSu Pitts was so recognizable in comedies that the public didn&#x27;t take her dramatic efforts seriously. In the classic war drama &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), Pitts was cast as the distraught mother of young soldier Lew Ayres, but at preview screenings her intense performance drew unintentional laughs. Her scenes were refilmed with Beryl Mercer. In 1936 RKO needed a replacement actress for its Hildegarde Withers series of murder mysteries; Edna May Oliver had left the studio and Helen Broderick succeeded Oliver in the role. Pitts was chosen to succeed Broderick. In theory, it was a good idea: Pitts seemed to fit the role of a prim, spinster schoolmistress. However, mystery fans couldn&#x27;t accept the fluttery Pitts as a brainy sleuth who matched wits with the police, and after her two Withers films the series was abandoned.

==Radio and stage==
Beginning in the 1930s, Pitts found work in radio. She appeared several times in the earliest &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; shows, playing a dizzy dame constantly looking for a husband. When Marian Jordan temporarily withdrew from &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; due to illness, Pitts made guest appearances opposite Jim Jordan as Fibber. Pitts also guested on variety shows, trading banter with Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, W.C. Fields, and Rudy Vallee, among others. She played Miss Mamie Wayne in the soap opera &quot;Big Sister&quot;., and was heard as Miss Pitts on &quot;The New Lum and Abner Show&quot;.

In 1944, Pitts tackled Broadway, making her debut in the mystery &quot;Ramshackle Inn&quot;. The play, written expressly for her, did well, and she took the show on the road in later years. She was also a familiar attraction in summer-stock theaters, playing annually in the Norma Mitchell play &quot;Post Road.&quot;

==Postwar movies and television==
Postwar films continued to give her the chance to play comic snoops and flighty relatives in such fare as &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1947), but in the 1950s, she started focusing on television. This culminated in her best-known series role, playing second banana to Gale Storm in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Gale Storm Show&quot; (1956) (also known as &quot;Oh, Susanna&quot;), in the role of Elvira Nugent (&quot;Nugie&quot;), the shipboard beautician. In 1961, Pitts was cast opposite Earle Hodgins in the episode &quot;Lonesome&#x27;s Gal&quot; of the ABC sitcom &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, set on a dude ranch in New Mexico. In 1962, she appeared in an episode of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Case of the Absent Artist&quot;. Her final role was as Gertie, the switchboard operator in the Stanley Kramer comedy epic &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963).

==Personal life==

Pitts was married to actor Thomas Sarsfield Gallery from 1920 until their 1933 divorce. Gallery became a Los Angeles boxing promoter and later a TV executive. The couple had two children:
*ZaSu Ann Gallery
*Donald Michael &quot;Sonny&quot; Gallery (born Marvin Carville La Marr), whom they adopted and renamed after the 1926 death of Donald&#x27;s biological mother (and Pitts&#x27;s friend), actress Barbara La Marr.

In 1933, Pitts married John Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Woodall, with whom she remained until her death.

Declining health dominated Pitts&#x27;s later years, particularly after she was diagnosed with cancer in the mid-1950s. She continued to work, appearing on TV and making brief appearances in the films &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;.

She died in Hollywood on June 7, 1963, aged 69, and was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Pitts wrote a book of candy recipes, &quot;Candy Hits&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1963.

==Legacy==

ZaSu Pitts was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960, for her contribution to motion pictures. Her star is on the south side of the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1994, she was honored with her image on a United States postage stamp along with fellow actors Rudolph Valentino, Clara Bow and Charlie Chaplin as part of The Silent Screen Stars stamp set, designed by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld. Her birthplace of Parsons, Kansas, has a star tile at the entrance to the Parsons Theatre to commemorate her.

In the film &quot;Never Give a Sucker an Even Break&quot; (1941), W.C. Fields asks his niece, played by Gloria Jean, &quot;Don&#x27;t you want to go to school? You want to grow up and be dumb like ZaSu Pitts?&quot; Gloria Jean replied &quot;She only acts like that in pictures. I like her.&quot;

Actress Mae Questel, who performed character voices in Max Fleischer&#x27;s Popeye and Betty Boop cartoons, reportedly based the fluttering utterances of Olive Oyl on Pitts.

<doc id="254519" wikidata="Q161138" url="?curid=254519" title="Bluebeard">
<text>&quot;Bluebeard&quot; ( ) is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in . The tale tells the story of a wealthy man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of the present one to avoid the fate of her predecessors. &quot;The White Dove&quot;, &quot;The Robber Bridegroom&quot;, and &quot;Fitcher&#x27;s Bird&quot; (also called &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Fowl&quot;) are tales similar to &quot;Bluebeard&quot;. The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word &quot;Bluebeard&quot; the definition of &quot;a man who marries and kills one wife after another&quot;. The verb &quot;bluebearding&quot; has even appeared as a way to describe the crime of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women.

==Plot ==

In one version of the story, Bluebeard is a wealthy and powerful nobleman who has been married six times to beautiful women who have all mysteriously vanished. When he visits his neighbor and asks to marry one of his daughters, they are terrified. After hosting a wonderful banquet, the youngest decides to be his wife and goes to live with him in his rich and luxurious palace in the countryside, away from her family. 

Bluebeard announces that he must leave for the country and gives the palace keys to his wife. She is able to open any room with them, each of which contain some of his riches, except for an underground chamber that he strictly forbids her to enter lest she suffer his wrath. He then goes away, leaving the palace and the keys in her hands. She invites her sister, Anne, and her friends and cousins over for a party. However, she is eventually overcome with the desire to see what the secret room holds, and she sneaks away from the party and ventures into it.

She immediately discovers that the room is flooded with blood and the murdered corpses of Bluebeard&#x27;s previous six wives hanging on hooks from the walls. Horrified, she drops the key in the blood and flees the room. She tries to wipe the blood stain off the key, but the key is magic and the stain cannot be removed from it.

Bluebeard unexpectedly returns and finds the bloody key. In a blind rage, he threatens to kill his wife on the spot, but she asks for one last prayer with Anne. Then, as Bluebeard is about to deliver the fatal blow, Anne and the wife&#x27;s brothers arrive and kill him. The wife inherits his fortune and castle, and has his six dead wives laid to rest. She uses the fortune to have her siblings married then remarries herself, finally moving on from the horror of her time with Bluebeard.

==Sources==
Although best known as a folktale, the character of Bluebeard appears to derive from legends related to historical individuals in Brittany. One source is believed to have been the 15th-century convicted serial killer Gilles de Rais, a nobleman who fought alongside Joan of Arc and became both Marshal of France and her official protector, then was hanged and burned as a murderous witch. However, Gilles de Rais did not kill his wife, nor were any bodies found on his property, and the crimes for which he was convicted involved the sexually driven, brutal murder of children rather than women.

Another possible source stems from the story of the early Breton king Conomor the Accursed and his wife Tryphine. This is recorded in a biography of St. Gildas, written five centuries after his death in the sixth century. It describes how after Conomor married Tryphine, she was warned by the ghosts of his previous wives that he murders them when they become pregnant. Pregnant, she flees; he catches and beheads her, but St. Gildas miraculously restores her to life, and when he brings her to Conomor, the walls of his castle collapse and kill him. Conomor is a historical figure, known locally as a werewolf, and various local churches are dedicated to Saint Tryphine and her son, Saint Tremeur.

==Commentaries==

The fatal effects of female curiosity have long been the subject of story and legend. Pandora and Psyche are examples of women in mythic stories whose curiosity has dire consequences. In giving his wife the keys to his castle, Bluebeard is acting the part of the serpent of the biblical Paradise, and therefore of the devil, and his wife the part of the victim held by the serpent&#x27;s gaze.

While some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as Perrault&#x27;s moral suggests), folklorist Maria Tatar has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men&#x27;s rules in the fairy-tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society&#x27;s rules and being punished for their transgression. The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.

Tatar, however, does go on to speak of Bluebeard as something of a &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; narrative. The original Beauty and the Beast tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont is said to be a story created to condition young women into the possibility of not only marriage, but marrying young, and to placate their fears of the implications of an older husband. It shows the beast as secretly compassionate, and someone meant to curb the intense sexual fear that young women have of marriage. Though &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; holds several similarities in Gothic imagery to &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (such as is shared with Cupid and Psyche as well, in the case of a mysterious captor, a looming castle, and a young, beautiful heroine), Tatar goes on to state that the latter tale lives on the entire opposite side of the spectrum: one in which, instead of female placation, the tale simply aggravates women&#x27;s apprehension, confirming one&#x27;s &quot;worst fears about sex&quot;.

Jungian psychoanalyst Clarissa Pinkola Estés refers to the key as &quot;the key of knowing&quot; which gives the wife consciousness. She can choose to not open the door and live as a naive young woman. Instead, she has chosen to open the door of truth.

For psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, &quot;Bluebeard&quot; can only be considered a fairy-tale because of the magical bleeding key; otherwise, it would just be a monstrous horror story. Bettelheim sees the key as associated with the male sexual organ, &quot;particularly the first intercourse when the hymen is broken and blood gets on it&quot;. For Bettelheim, the blood on the key is a symbol of the wife&#x27;s indiscretion.

For scholar Philip Lewis, the key offered to the wife by Bluebeard represents his superiority, since he knows something she does not. The blood on the key indicates that she now has knowledge. She has erased the difference between them, and in order to return her to her previous state, he must kill her.

==Aarne–Thompson classification==
According to the Aarne–Thompson system of classifying folktale plots, the tale of Bluebeard is type 312. Another such tale is &quot;The White Dove&quot;, an oral French variant. The type is closely related to Aarne–Thompson type 311 in which the heroine rescues herself and her sisters, in such tales as &quot;Fitcher&#x27;s Bird&quot;, &quot;The Old Dame and Her Hen&quot;, and &quot;How the Devil Married Three Sisters&quot;. The tales where the youngest daughter rescues herself and the other sisters from the villain are in fact far more common in oral traditions than this type, where the heroine&#x27;s brother rescues her. Other such tales do exist, however; the brother is sometimes aided in the rescue by marvelous dogs or wild animals.

Some European variants of the ballad &quot;Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight&quot;, Child ballad 4, closely resemble this tale. This is particularly noteworthy among some German variants, where the heroine calls for help much like Sister Anne calls for help to her brothers in Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&quot;.

==Bluebeard&#x27;s wives==
It is not explained why Bluebeard murdered his first bride; she could not have entered the forbidden room and found a dead wife. Some scholars have theorized that he was testing his wife&#x27;s obedience, and that she was killed not for what she discovered there, but because she disobeyed his orders.

In the 1812 version published in &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy-Tales&quot;, Wilhelm Grimm, on p. XLI of the annotations, makes the following handwritten comment: &quot;It seems in all Märchen [fairy-tales] of Bluebeard, wherein his Blutrunst [lust for blood] has not rightly explained, the idea to be the basis of himself through bathing in blood to cure of the blue beard; as the lepers. That is also why it is written that the blood is collected in basins.&quot;

Maurice Maeterlinck wrote extensively on Bluebeard and his plays name at least six former wives: Sélysette from &quot;Aglavaine et Sélysette&quot; (1896), Alladine from &quot;Alladine et Palomides&quot; (1894), both Ygraine and Bellangère from &quot;La mort de Tintagiles&quot; (1894), Mélisande from &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, and Ariane from &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot; (1907).

In Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;Barbe-bleue&quot; (1866), the five previous wives are Héloïse, Eléonore, Isaure, Rosalinde and Blanche, with the sixth and final wife being a peasant girl, Boulotte, who finally reveals his secret when he attempts to have her killed so that he can marry Princess Hermia.

Béla Bartók&#x27;s opera &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1911), with a libretto by Béla Balázs, names &quot;Judith&quot; as wife number four.

Anatole France&#x27;s short story &quot;The Seven Wives of Bluebeard&quot; names Jeanne de Lespoisse as the last wife before Bluebeard&#x27;s death. The other wives were Collette Passage, Jeanne de la Cloche, Gigonne, Blanche de Gibeaumex, Angèle de la Garandine, and Alix de Pontalcin.

In Edward Dmytryk&#x27;s film &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1972), Baron von Sepper (Richard J. Burton) is an Austrian aristocrat known as Bluebeard for his blue-toned beard and his appetite for beautiful wives, and his wife is an American named Anne.

In Alex Garland&#x27;s film &quot;Ex Machina&quot; (2014), Nathan is an internet mogul who designs robots with a human female body inside his home. Each time he starts a new iteration of the robot, he eliminates the AI of the previous one and puts the robot body inside a cupboard in his vault. Nathan&#x27;s company is called &quot;Blue Book&quot; and a key plays a central role in the movie.

==&quot;Bluebeard&quot; and Orientalism in illustration and text==
Several scholars have noted the presence of Orientalism in illustrations of the tale, particularly those from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, although the trend has been dated as far back as 1805. Artists such as Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, Harry Clarke, Jennie Harbour, and others portrayed Bluebeard with an Oriental appearance, wearing clothing such as a turban, a vibrantly colored silk robe, and pointed slippers, carrying a scimitar. These motifs often extended to depictions of his castle (which has been likened to &quot;a harem&quot;) and the attire of the wife, who usually retained her &quot;European features&quot;. Dulac in particular was known for incorporating such themes into his work, and his lavish illustrations of the tale are often cited as prime examples of the trend, with Anna Guiterrez calling them &quot;[an] Oriental [fantasy]&quot;. Dulac also notably illustrated a version of Beauty and the Beast with similar overtones.

Folklorist Maria Tatar has claimed the popularity of Sir Richard Francis Burton&#x27;s 1888 ten-volume translation of the Middle eastern story collection &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; influenced such depictions, with Victorian and Edwardian artists perhaps seeing a link between Bluebeard and the frame story&#x27;s Persian king Shahryār, who similarly had a succession of wives whom he killed before the current one, when the story begins. Another recognized influence is the 1798 opera &quot;The Grand Dramatic Romance Blue-Beard, or Female Curiosity&quot; by George Colman the Younger, composed by Michael Kelly. Pantomime versions of the tale were staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London as early as 1798, and continued until at least 1901. Often, these productions set the story in the Ottoman Empire or Persia with elaborate Eastern-inspired costumes and sets. On a psychological level, Marina Warner has noted the similarities between the French words for &quot;beard&quot; and &quot;barbarian&quot; (&quot;barbe&quot; and &quot;barbare&quot;, respectively), which she theorized lead to artists such as Rackham portraying the king as &quot;a Turk in pantaloons and turban, who rides an elephant, and grasps his wife by the hair when he prepares to behead her with his scimitar.&quot;

Tatar further theorized in a later article that the apparent mismatch between Orientalist illustrations and the story&#x27;s European origin stemmed from the violent plot clashing with the prim morals of society at the time, writing &quot;After all, it&#x27;s much more comforting for the French reader to think of such marital discord and violence as having taken place long ago and far away, rather than at home in today&#x27;s France.&quot; Kelly Faircloth also noted this discrepancy, citing the illustrations as &quot;pushing the whole disquieting tale into the geographic and cultural distance&quot;.

More uncommonly, these Orientalist themes sometimes extended to the text itself, with rewrites moving the setting from the French countryside to a Middle Eastern city such as Baghdad and giving the wife the Arabic name &quot;Fatima&quot;, though Bluebeard and the wife&#x27;s sister Anne often contradictorily retained their European names. New retellings of the story contained Orientalist themes as late as 1933.

Though criticism of this phenomenon did not widely come about until the 21st century, an early detractor was Scottish folklorist Andrew Lang, selector and editor of the popular children&#x27;s series &quot;Lang&#x27;s Fairy Books&quot;. Lang was displeased with the Orientalist themes in then-current illustration, seeing it as a deliberate masking of the story&#x27;s European origins, and commented in the introduction to the first volume of the series, 1889&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Fairy Book&quot;: &quot;Monsieur de la Barbe Bleue was &quot;not&quot; a Turk!...They were all French folk and Christians; had he been a Turk, Blue Beard need not have wedded to but one wife at a time.&quot; Despite Lang&#x27;s grievances, the illustrations for the tale in the volume by G.P. Jacomb-Hood portray Bluebeard, his wife, and the castle with a Middle Eastern motif.

Orientalist themes gradually disappeared from retellings in the latter half of the 20th century and beyond, which were increasingly aimed at recontextualizing the morals and themes of the tale (such as Angela Carter&#x27;s 1979 short story &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, which explicitly sets the tale in France).

== Real life accounts ==
Henri Désiré Landru was a French serial killer during the First World War and nicknamed the &quot;Bluebeard of Gambais&quot;. His story was lampooned in the Charlie Chaplin black comedy film &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; (1947).

An eponymous dramatic film, &quot;Landru&quot;, was released in France in 1963.

* &quot;How to be Eaten&quot; (2022), a novel by Maria Adelmann
In Charles Dickens&#x27; short story &quot;Captain Murderer&quot; (1860), the title character is described as &quot;an offshoot of the Bluebeard family&quot;. The twist of this story is that he cannibalises each wife shortly after marriage, baking her flesh in a huge meat pie. He meets his demise after his sister-in-law, in revenge for the death of her sister (his next-to-last wife), marries him and consumes a deadly poison just before he kills and eats her.

In Anatole France&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Wives of Bluebeard&quot;, Bluebeard is the victim of the tale, and his wives the perpetrators. Bluebeard is a generous, kind-hearted, wealthy nobleman called Bertrand de Montragoux who marries a succession of grotesque, adulterous, difficult, or simple-minded wives. His first six wives all die, flee, or are sent away under unfortunate circumstances, none of which are his fault. His seventh wife deceives him with another lover and murders him for his wealth.

In Angela Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Bloody Chamber&quot;, Bluebeard is a 1920s decadent with a collection of erotic drawings, and Bluebeard&#x27;s wife is rescued by her mother, who rides in on a horse and shoots Bluebeard between the eyes, rather than by her brothers as in the original fairy-tale.

In Joyce Carol Oates&#x27; short story, &quot;Blue-Bearded Lover&quot;, the most recent wife is well aware of Bluebeard&#x27;s murdered wives: she does not unlock the door to the forbidden room, and therefore avoids death herself. She remains with Bluebeard despite knowing he is a murderer, and gives birth to Bluebeard&#x27;s children. The book has been interpreted as a feminist struggle for sexual power.

In Helen Oyeyemi&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Fox&quot;, Mr. Fox is a writer of slasher novels, with a muse named Mary. Mary questions Mr. Fox about why he writes about killing women who have transgressed patriarchal laws, making him aware of how his words normalize domestic violence. One of the stories in the book is about a girl named Mary who has a fear of serial killers because her father raised her on stories about men who killed women who did not obey them and then killed her mother.

Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&quot; features a painter who calls himself Bluebeard, and who considers his art studio to be a forbidden chamber where his girlfriend Circe Berman is not allowed to go.

In Donald Barthelme&#x27;s &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, the wife believes that the carcasses of Bluebeard&#x27;s previous six wives are behind the door. She loses the key and her lover hides the three duplicates. One afternoon Bluebeard insists that she open the door, so she borrows his key. Inside, she finds the decaying carcasses of six zebras dressed in Coco Chanel gowns.

<text>Roots to Branches is the 19th studio album by the British band Jethro Tull released in September 1995. It carries characteristics of Tull&#x27;s classic 1970s progressive rock and folk rock roots alongside jazz and Arabic and Indian influences. All songs were written by Ian Anderson and recorded at his home studio. This is the last Tull album to feature Dave Pegg on the bass, and the first to feature keyboardist Andrew Giddings as an official band member, although he had contributed to &quot;Catfish Rising&quot; (1991) on a session basis. As a result, the album features the five longest serving members to date in Jethro Tull’s history. It was the final Tull album to be released through long-time label Chrysalis Records.

A remastered edition of the album was released in January 2007.

==Production and musical style==
The album was derived in part from the visit Ian Anderson made to India. S.A. Allen, in a history of the band, describes the album as an &quot;Indian &quot;Songs from the Wood&quot;.&quot;

Ian Anderson said of the album: &quot;I see &quot;Roots To Branches&quot; as the 90s version of &quot;Stand Up&quot;, because it has a lot of the things that I feel represented the key elements of Jethro Tull: there&#x27;s lots of flute, lots of riffy guitars and quite a broad palette of influences, from the blues and classical to the Eastern motifs that were apparent on &quot;Stand Up&quot; &quot;. On the other hand, Anderson also added that &quot;the only thing about it that lets me down is that I made it sound a little too Seventies. I deliberately made the album sound like it was in the context of a live performance, rather than have it sound too &#x27;studio.&#x27; But looking back on it, I think it should have been a bit more varied&quot;.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic made an unimpressed but positive review: &quot;All of the songs here have more of a mood of urgency than some of Tull&#x27;s then-recent albums, and a few even have memorable melodies [...] Anderson&#x27;s flute occasionally takes flight, Martin Barre&#x27;s guitar still wails on the breaks, and Doane Perry (drums), Dave Pegg (bass), and Steve Bailey (bass) make up a decent rhythm section. Not nearly as strong as &quot;Catfish Rising&quot;, but better than anything else since &quot;Heavy Horses&quot;&quot;.

===Charts===
The album sold less than the predecessor, reaching only No. 114 on the US Billboard Charts, but achieving No. 20 on the UK Albums Chart.

<text>The Fundación Colegio Americano de Quito or Colegio Americano de Quito (American School of Quito) is a private college preparatory school in Quito, Ecuador. In 1940 it was founded by the former president of Ecuador and the president of the Organization of American States (OAS) Galo Plaza Lasso, and Boaz Long.

==History==
The American School of Quito was founded on October 14, 1940 to 162 students. The first directors were Robert E. and Mrs. Hazel J. Tucker, who had just arrived from the United States. The founders of the school lived in a time characterized by the fascist movements in Europe, represented in Ecuador and other South American nations by the German and Italian schools operating.

The school hired English-speaking, U.S.-educated Ecuadorian teachers to teach civics, geography, history of Ecuador, and Spanish classes, while Americans taught the other classes. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Education cooperated with the foundation of the school. The U.S. and Ecuadorian governments did not have plans to financially aid the school. The school used an educational program derived from the Santa Barbara, California public schools and the Columbia University Lincoln School.

In 2022 the American School had over 2,200 students from Nursery to twelfth grade. Among these students are the children and grandchildren of founding families. The school is co-educational, non-religious, and is a non-profit foundation. It is accredited by Cognia and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education and Culture. It is recognized by the International Baccalaureate Organization and offers both I.B. Programmes: Middle Years and Diploma. American School graduates can obtain three diplomas: a high school diploma accredited in the United States, the Ecuadorian Bachillerato, and the I.B. Diploma.

==Student Council==
Every year students from high school vote for the Student Council. The student Council is a group of representatives for high school that run activities and organize events. Candidates from the Student Council come from 11th or 12th (Secretary, Treasurer and Vice-President), and 12th grade only (President).

==Model United Nations==
The School hosts the largest Model United Nations in Spanish each year, which include local schools, thus contributing to the practice of democratic principles and the analysis of global and local issues in Ecuador.

<doc id="254533" wikidata="Q15152527" url="?curid=254533" title="Cathodic protection">
<text>Cathodic protection (CP; ) is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. A simple method of protection connects the metal to be protected to a more easily corroded &quot;sacrificial metal&quot; to act as the anode. The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal. For structures such as long pipelines, where passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate, an external DC electrical power source is used to provide sufficient current.

Cathodic protection systems protect a wide range of metallic structures in various environments. Common applications are: steel water or fuel pipelines and steel storage tanks such as home water heaters; steel pier piles; ship and boat hulls; offshore oil platforms and onshore oil well casings; offshore wind farm foundations and metal reinforcement bars in concrete buildings and structures. Another common application is in galvanized steel, in which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts protects them from rust.

Cathodic protection can, in some cases, prevent stress corrosion cracking.

==History==
Cathodic protection was first described by Sir Humphry Davy in a series of papers presented to the Royal Society in London in 1824. The first application was to in 1824. Sacrificial anodes made from iron attached to the copper sheath of the hull below the waterline dramatically reduced the corrosion rate of the copper. However, a side effect of cathodic protection was the increase in marine growth. Usually, copper when corroding releases copper ions which have an anti-fouling effect. Since excess marine growth affected the performance of the ship, the Royal Navy decided that it was better to allow the copper to corrode and have the benefit of reduced marine growth, so cathodic protection was not used further.

Davy was assisted in his experiments by his pupil Michael Faraday, who continued his research after Davy&#x27;s death. In 1834, Faraday discovered the quantitative connection between corrosion weight loss and electric current and thus laid the foundation for the future application of cathodic protection.

Thomas Edison experimented with impressed current cathodic protection on ships in 1890, but was unsuccessful due to the lack of a suitable current source and anode materials. It would be 100 years after Davy&#x27;s experiment before cathodic protection was used widely on oil pipelines in the United States cathodic protection was applied to steel gas pipelines beginning in 1928 and more widely in the 1930s.

In the application of &quot;passive&quot; cathodic protection, a &quot;galvanic anode&quot;, a piece of a more electrochemically &quot;active&quot; metal (more negative electrode potential), is attached to the vulnerable metal surface where it is exposed to an electrolyte. Galvanic anodes are selected because they have a more &quot;active&quot; voltage than the metal of the target structure (typically steel).

Concrete has a pH around 13. In this environment the steel reinforcement has a passive protective layer and remains largely stable. Galvanic systems are &quot;constant potential&quot; systems that aim to restore the concrete&#x27;s natural protective environment by providing a high initial current to restore passivity. It then reverts to a lower sacrificial current, while harmful negative chloride ions migrate away from the steel and towards the positive anode. The anodes remain reactive through their lifetime (10–20 years typically), increasing current when the resistivity decreases due to corrosion hazards such as rainfall, temperature increases, or flooding. The reactive nature of these anodes makes them an efficient choice.

Unlike impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems, steel constant polarization is not the goal, rather the restoration of the environment. Polarization of the target structure is caused by the electron flow from the anode to the cathode, so the two metals must have a good electrically conductive contact. The driving force for the cathodic protection current is the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode. During the initial phase of high current, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative protecting the steel which hydroxide ion generation at the steel surface and ionic migration restore the concrete environment.

Over time the galvanic anode continues to corrode, consuming the anode material until eventually it must be replaced.

Galvanic or sacrificial anodes are made in various shapes and sizes using alloys of zinc, magnesium, and aluminum. ASTM International publishes standards on the composition and manufacturing of galvanic anodes.

In order for galvanic cathodic protection to work, the anode must possess a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than that of the cathode (the target structure to be protected). The table below shows a simplified galvanic series which is used to select the anode metal. The anode must be chosen from a material that is lower on the list than the material to be protected.

===Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP)===

In some cases, &quot;impressed current cathodic protection&quot; (ICCP) systems are used. These consist of anodes connected to a DC power source, often a transformer-rectifier connected to AC power. In the absence of an AC supply, alternative power sources may be used, such as solar panels, wind power or gas powered thermoelectric generators.

Anodes for ICCP systems are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Common anodes are tubular and solid rod shapes or continuous ribbons of various materials. These include high silicon, cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide (MMO), platinum and niobium coated wire and other materials.

For pipelines, anodes are arranged in groundbeds either distributed or in a deep vertical hole depending on several design and field condition factors including current distribution requirements.

Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are often custom manufactured and equipped with a variety of features, including remote monitoring and control, integral current interrupters and various type of electrical enclosures. The output DC negative terminal is connected to the structure to be protected by the cathodic protection system. The rectifier output DC positive cable is connected to the anodes. The AC power cable is connected to the rectifier input terminals.

The output of the ICCP system should be optimized to provide enough current to provide protection to the target structure. Some cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are designed with taps on the transformer windings and jumper terminals to select the voltage output of the ICCP system. Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units for water tanks and used in other applications are made with solid state circuits to automatically adjust the operating voltage to maintain the optimum current output or structure-to-electrolyte potential. Analog or digital meters are often installed to show the operating voltages (DC and sometimes AC) and current output. For shore structures and other large complex target structures, ICCP systems are often designed with multiple independent zones of anodes with separate cathodic protection transformer-rectifier circuits.

===Hybrid systems===
Hybrid systems use a combination of the aforementioned systems to achieve some of the benefits of both, utilizing the restorative capabilities of ICCP systems but maintaining the reactive, lower cost, and easier-to-maintain nature of a galvanic anode.

The system is made up of wired galvanic anodes in arrays typically apart, which are then initially powered for a short period to restore the concrete and to power ionic migration. The power supply is then taken away and the anodes are simply attached to the steel as a galvanic system. More powered phases can be administered if needed. Like galvanic systems, corrosion rate monitoring from polarization tests and half-cell potential mapping can be used to measure corrosion. Polarization is not the goal for the life of the system.

==Applications==

===Hot water tank / Water heater===
This technology is also used to protect water heaters. Indeed, the electrons sent by the imposed current anode (composed of titanium and covered with MMO) prevents the inside of the tank from rusting.

In order to be recognized as effective, these anodes must comply with certain standards: A cathodic protection system is considered efficient when its potential reaches or exceeds the limits established by the cathodic protection criteria. The cathode protection criteria used come from the standard NACE SP0388-2007 (formerly RP0388-2001) of the NACE National Association of Corrosion Engineers.

===Pipelines===

Hazardous product pipelines are routinely protected by a coating supplemented with cathodic protection. An impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) for a pipeline consists of a DC power source, often an AC powered transformer rectifier and an anode, or array of anodes buried in the ground (the anode groundbed).

The DC power source would typically have a DC output of up to 50 amperes and 50 volts, but this depends on several factors, such as the size of the pipeline and coating quality. The positive DC output terminal would be connected via cables to the anode array, while another cable would connect the negative terminal of the rectifier to the pipeline, preferably through junction boxes to allow measurements to be taken.

Anodes can be installed in a groundbed consisting of a vertical hole backfilled with conductive coke (a material that improves the performance and life of the anodes) or laid in a prepared trench, surrounded by conductive coke and backfilled. The choice of groundbed type and size depends on the application, location and soil resistivity.

The DC cathodic protection current is then adjusted to the optimum level after conducting various tests including measurements of pipe-to-soil potentials or electrode potential.

It is sometimes more economically viable to protect a pipeline using galvanic (sacrificial) anodes. This is often the case on smaller diameter pipelines of limited length. Galvanic anodes rely on the galvanic series potentials of the metals to drive cathodic protection current from the anode to the structure being protected.

Water pipelines of various pipe materials are also provided with cathodic protection where owners determine the cost is reasonable for the expected pipeline service life extension attributed to the application of cathodic protection.

===Ships and boats===
Cathodic protection on ships is often implemented by galvanic anodes attached to the hull and ICCP for larger vessels. Since ships are regularly removed from the water for inspections and maintenance, it is a simple task to replace the galvanic anodes.

Galvanic anodes are generally shaped to reduced drag in the water and fitted flush to the hull to also try to minimize drag.

Smaller vessels, with non-metallic hulls, such as yachts, are equipped with galvanic anodes to protect areas such as outboard motors. As with all galvanic cathodic protection, this application relies on a solid electrical connection between the anode and the item to be protected.

For ICCP on ships, the anodes are usually constructed of a relatively inert material such as platinized titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted on the outside of the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a compression seal fitting and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit. Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5 ft below the light load line in an area to avoid mechanical damage. The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.

Some ships may require specialist treatment, for example aluminum hulls with steel fixtures will create an electrochemical cell where the aluminum hull can act as a galvanic anode and corrosion is enhanced. In cases like this, aluminum or zinc galvanic anodes can be used to offset the potential difference between the aluminum hull and the steel fixture. If the steel fixtures are large, several galvanic anodes may be required, or even a small ICCP system.

===Marine===
Marine cathodic protection covers many areas, jetties, harbors, offshore structures. The variety of different types of structure leads to a variety of systems to provide protection. Galvanic anodes are favored, but ICCP can also often be used. Because of the wide variety of structure geometry, composition, and architecture, specialized firms are often required to engineer structure-specific cathodic protection systems. Sometimes marine structures require retroactive modification to be effectively protected 

===Steel in concrete===
The application to concrete reinforcement is slightly different in that the anodes and reference electrodes are usually embedded in the concrete at the time of construction when the concrete is being poured. The usual technique for concrete buildings, bridges and similar structures is to use ICCP, but there are systems available that use the principle of galvanic cathodic protection as well, although in the UK at least, the use of galvanic anodes for atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures is considered experimental.

For ICCP, the principle is the same as any other ICCP system. However, in a typical atmospherically exposed concrete structure such as a bridge, there will be many more anodes distributed through the structure as opposed to an array of anodes as used on a pipeline. This makes for a more complicated system and usually an automatically controlled DC power source is used, possibly with an option for remote monitoring and operation. For buried or submerged structures, the treatment is similar to that of any other buried or submerged structure.

Galvanic systems offer the advantage of being easier to retrofit and do not need any control systems as ICCP does.

For pipelines constructed from pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP), the techniques used for cathodic protection are generally as for steel pipelines except that the applied potential must be limited to prevent damage to the prestressing wire.

The steel wire in a PCCP pipeline is stressed to the point that any corrosion of the wire can result in failure. An additional problem is that any excessive hydrogen ions as a result of an excessively negative potential can cause hydrogen embrittlement of the wire, also resulting in failure. The failure of too many wires will result in catastrophic failure of the PCCP. To implement ICCP therefore requires very careful control to ensure satisfactory protection. A simpler option is to use galvanic anodes, which are self-limiting and need no control.

===Internal cathodic protection===
Vessels, pipelines and tanks (including ballast tanks) which are used to store or transport liquids can also be protected from corrosion on their internal surfaces by the use of cathodic protection. ICCP and galvanic systems can be used. A common application of internal cathodic protection is water storage tanks and power plant shell and tube heat exchangers.

===Galvanized steel===
Galvanizing generally refers to hot-dip galvanizing which is a way of coating steel with a layer of metallic zinc or tin. Lead or antimony are often added to the molten zinc bath, and also other metals have been studied. Galvanized coatings are quite durable in most environments because they combine the barrier properties of a coating with some of the benefits of cathodic protection. If the zinc coating is scratched or otherwise locally damaged and steel is exposed, the surrounding areas of zinc coating form a galvanic cell with the exposed steel and protect it from corrosion. This is a form of localized cathodic protection - the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode.

Galvanizing, while using the electrochemical principle of cathodic protection, is not actually cathodic but sacrificial protection. In the case of galvanizing, only areas very close to the zinc are protected. Hence, a larger area of bare steel would only be protected around the edges.

===Automobiles===
Several companies market electronic devices claiming to mitigate corrosion for automobiles and trucks. Corrosion control professionals find they do not work. There is no peer reviewed scientific testing and validation supporting the use of the devices. In 1996 the FTC ordered David McCready, a person that sold devices claiming to protect cars from corrosion, to pay restitution and banned the names &quot;Rust Buster&quot; and &quot;Rust Evader.&quot;

Under section 74.01(1) (b) of the &quot;Competition Act Canada&quot;, no performance claims about a product or its effectiveness can be done unless it can be proven that they are based on adequate and proper tests. The Competition Bureau Canada proceeded to investigate several companies selling electronic corrosion devices in Canada. Some were forced to withdraw their product from the market as they could not support their claims scientifically. However, at least two companies under investigation were able to satisfy the Competition Bureau that their claims of protecting vehicles against corrosion were based on adequate and proper testing under section 74.01(1) (b) of the &quot;Competition Act&quot;.

In response to the Competition Bureau&#x27;s investigation into its distribution of the Impressed Current Cathodic Protection module in the Canadian market, the Auto Saver Systems, Inc. submitted its module to laboratory testing in an ISO-certified lab. The test methodology consisted of the ASTM B117 Standard Practice for Operating Salt Spray (Fog) Apparatus which a corrosion expert, retained by the Competition Bureau, adapted in order to replicate the operational environment of an automobile. The test differed from the ASTM B117 insofar as the galvanized automotive steel panels were not entirely exposed to the salt spray. Instead, only the bare steel exposed by a 12-inch scratch at one end of the panel was exposed to the salt spray while the remainder of the panel was kept in a completely dry condition.

The test results, as reported to and validated by the Competition Bureau, demonstrated that the Auto Saver module being tested was able to cause a shift, in the negative direction, in the electrochemical corrosion potential of the iron in the steel panels, proving the attainment of cathodic protection and the resulting slowdown of the oxidation process of the iron (rust formation). A visual inspection of both galvanized and non-galvanized test panels showed a significant reduction in the appearance of rust compared to the control panels (not connected to the protection module), consistent with the observed cathodic shift in the electrochemical potential measurements obtained on the panels during the tests.

A second company, Canadian Auto Preservation Inc., was also able to satisfy the Competition Bureau proving that the testing of its Electromagnetically Induced Corrosion Control Technology (EICCT) was adequate and proper. The testing of that module, which relied on a methodology very similar to that used by Auto Saver, also produced a shift, in the negative direction, in the electrochemical corrosion potential of the iron galvanized automotive steel panels, consistent with the attainment of cathodic protection.  A peer review article alluding to the efficacy of the Final Coat technology in inhibiting corrosion on automobiles was published in 2017.

The results achieved by both these electronic corrosion inhibitor devices point to the need for further research and testing in order to better understand how these devices are able to generate a shift in the potential of the metal panels, i.e., a cathodic effect, in the absence of a continuous electrolytic path required to close the electrical circuit between the positive and the negative poles, in accordance with accepted principles of cathodic protection.

==Testing==

Electrode potential is measured with reference electrodes. Copper-copper sulphate electrodes are used for structures in contact with soil or fresh water. Silver/silver chloride/seawater electrodes or pure zinc electrodes are used for seawater applications. The methods are described in EN 13509:2003 and NACE TM0497 along with the sources of error in the voltage that appears on the display of the meter. Interpretation of electrode potential measurements to determine the potential at the interface between the anode of the corrosion cell and the electrolyte requires training and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of measurements done in laboratory work.

==Problems==

===Production of hydrogen===
A side effect of improperly applied cathodic protection is the production of atomic hydrogen, leading to its absorption in the protected metal and subsequent hydrogen embrittlement of welds and materials with high hardness. Under normal conditions, the atomic hydrogen will combine at the metal surface to create hydrogen gas, which cannot penetrate the metal. Hydrogen atoms, however, are small enough to pass through the crystalline steel structure, and can lead in some cases to hydrogen embrittlement.

===Cathodic disbonding===
This is a process of disbondment of protective coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode). Disbonding can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization. The degree of disbonding is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others. Cathodic protection systems should be operated so that the structure does not become excessively polarized, since this also promotes disbonding due to excessively negative potentials. Cathodic disbonding occurs rapidly in pipelines that contain hot fluids because the process is accelerated by heat flow.

===Cathodic shielding===
Effectiveness of cathodic protection (CP) systems on steel pipelines can be impaired by the use of solid film backed dielectric coatings such as polyethylene tapes, shrinkable pipeline sleeves, and factory applied single or multiple solid film coatings. This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings. Protective electric current from the cathodic protection system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing. Cathodic shielding was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.

A 1999 report concerning a spill from a Saskatchewan crude oil line contains an excellent definition of the cathodic shielding problem:

:&quot;The triple situation of disbondment of the (corrosion) coating, the dielectric nature of the coating and the unique electrochemical environment established under the exterior coating, which acts as a shield to the electrical CP current, is referred to as CP shielding. The combination of tenting and disbondment permits a corrosive environment around the outside of the pipe to enter into the void between the exterior coating and the pipe surface. With the development of this CP shielding phenomenon, impressed current from the CP system cannot access exposed metal under the exterior coating to protect the pipe surface from the consequences of an aggressive corrosive environment. The CP shielding phenomenon induces changes in the potential gradient of the CP system across the exterior coating, which are further pronounced in areas of insufficient or sub-standard CP current emanating from the pipeline&#x27;s CP system. This produces an area on the pipeline of insufficient CP defense against metal loss aggravated by an exterior corrosive environment.&quot;

Cathodic shielding is referenced in a number of the standards listed below. Newly issued USDOT regulation Title 49 CFR 192.112, in the section for &quot;Additional design requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure&quot; requires that &quot;The pipe must be protected against external corrosion by a non-shielding coating&quot; (see coatings section on standard). Also, the NACE SP0169:2007 standard defines shielding in section 2, cautions against the use of materials that create electrical shielding in section 4.2.3, cautions against use of external coatings that create electrical shielding in section 5.1.2.3, and instructs readers to take &#x27;appropriate action&#x27; when the effects of electrical shielding of cathodic protection current are detected on an operating pipeline in section 10.9.

== Certification ==
In many countries, having a related CP certificate is recommended or, in some cases, mandatory for doing a CP job, from field test to design. There are different certification bodies and evaluation methods, but two of them are more common: AMPP certification and ISO 15257.

AMPP cathodic protection certification has four levels: Tester, Technician, Technologist, and Specialist.

ISO 15257 has five levels: Four levels close to the AMPP definition, plus another level for those who have made a scientific contribution.

<doc id="254537" wikidata="Q2532009" url="?curid=254537" title="Wrecking Crew (video game)">
<text>is an action game developed and published by Nintendo. Designed by Yoshio Sakamoto, it was first released as an arcade video game for the Nintendo VS. System in 1984, titled Vs. Wrecking Crew with a simultaneous two-player mode. It was released as a single-player game for the Family Computer (Famicom) console in 1985, and as a launch game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) later that year. A sequel, &quot;Wrecking Crew &#x27;98&quot;, was released in Japan in 1998 for the Super Famicom.

==Gameplay==

The player controls Mario (or Luigi in two-player mode) and attempts to destroy all of a certain set of objects with a large hammer on each of 100 levels. Mario cannot jump because of the hammer&#x27;s weight. The player can select any level to start on from the title screen. Each level&#x27;s playfield is divided into an invisible grid, each space of which can contain one object. Objects include these: destructible walls, pillars, and ladders; indestructible barrels and ladders; bombs that destroy all connected destructible objects; and various enemies that Mario must avoid. Doors may be opened to cause enemies to move harmlessly into the background. The game introduced a new character, a construction foreman named Spike (known as Blackie in the Japanese version), who chases Mario and attempts to disrupt him by knocking down objects and causing him to fall to the bottom of the playfield. The player starts the game with five lives and loses a life whenever Mario comes in contact with an enemy or fireball. The game is over when all lives are lost. The game can also be aborted at any time, and must be aborted if Mario becomes trapped in a barrel.

Because Mario lacks the ability to jump, the player must figure out the optimal order in which to destroy objects—for example, if a player destroys a ladder too soon, a wall may become unreachable and thus the player cannot finish the level. Destroying multiple objects in a row (usually with a chain of bombs) scores extra bonus points, and occasionally bonus items may appear that Mario can collect.

&quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; features a level editor, which allows the player to design up to four custom levels. They can be saved and loaded using the Famicom Data Recorder, a cassette tape drive. Because this peripheral was only released for Famicom in Japan, other localizations cannot save or load the custom levels. The U.S. manual includes a note stating that the load and save functions &quot;have been programmed in for potential product developments&quot;. The feature was reenabled for the Wii Virtual Console release using Wii system storage.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Vs. Wrecking Crew&quot; in its October 1, 1984, issue as the thirteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

==Re-releases==
&quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; was re-released in 1989 on the Family Computer Disk System, and in 2004 as the 14th game of the &quot;Famicom Mini&quot; series on Game Boy Advance. It was also included as a playable bonus game in its sequel, &quot;Wrecking Crew &#x27;98&quot;.

The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. It was briefly distributed to Nintendo 3DS owners in September 2011 as part of the &quot;Ambassador Program&quot;, before being made available for general sale on 3DS Virtual Console in Japan in September 2012, with a release in other territories following in 2013. &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; was also released on the Wii U Virtual Console in June 2013. All Virtual Console releases, excluding the 3DS version, support saving custom level designs, which is not possible in the original NES version of the game.

In July 2019, &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; was added to the Nintendo Switch Online service as part of the paid membership.

==Sequel==
 is an action puzzle game released exclusively in Japan in 1998 for the Super Famicom&#x27;s Nintendo Power download service, and later on cartridge. Unlike the original, in which the player&#x27;s objective is to find ways to clear each level of all panels, &quot;Wrecking Crew &#x27;98&quot; takes a more competitive approach: various blocks and colored panels appear on each player&#x27;s side of the screen, and the player must attempt to line up three or more panels of the same color to remove them. When a set of panels disappears, all blocks and panels above it will drop, potentially allowing the player to create chain combos. Clearing four or more panels of the same color will trigger an attack that hinders the opponent; each panel color will produce a different type of attack. The match ends when one player&#x27;s screen becomes filled with panels, causing them to lose.

The game&#x27;s story features Mario returning to the Mushroom Kingdom after a trip, only to discover that Bowser has started a constructing multiple new high-rise bases, depriving the surrounding flora of sunlight. To stop Bowser, Mario retrieves his magic hammer from his time on the Wrecking Crew and begins demolishing Bowser&#x27;s bases. At each location, he encounters a member of Bowser&#x27;s construction crew whom he must defeat to destroy the base, including his former rival Foreman Spike.

The main single player mode is Story mode, in which the player controls Mario and travels through an overworld, entering each of Bowser&#x27;s construction sites and defeating a rival opponent. Completing each stage within a time limit will unlock several secret stages and an alternate ending. Clearing stages in Story mode will unlock up to 12 total playable characters for use in Versus mode, a competitive mode for one to two players. Clearing the Story also unlocks Tournament mode, in which eight characters compete in a single-elimination tournament until only one remains and is declared the champion. A playable port of the original &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; is also accessible from the main menu.

The game was re-released on the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on September 28, 2016, and on the Nintendo Switch Online service on April 12, 2024, for the first time in the West. A fanmade English translation patch for the game was released in October 2017.

==Legacy==
The Bonus Stage theme from &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; was remixed for &quot;Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix&quot; (2005). The Golden Hammer appears as a usable item in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008). A &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot; stage also appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; (2014) and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018).

Spike appears in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; (2023), voiced by Sebastian Maniscalco. This version is the former boss of Mario and Luigi before they started their plumbing business. After nearly 40 years, the name was standardized for future appearances as Spike also in Japan, where he was previously known as Blackie or Blacky due to his classically black beard and sunglasses, as it already was known in all regions before the release of the film.

<text>Pets.com was an American dot-com enterprise headquartered in San Francisco, U.S, that sold pet supplies to retail customers. The website was launched in November 1998 and was shut down in November 2000. A high-profile marketing campaign gave it a widely recognized public presence, including an appearance in the 1999 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and an advertisement in the 2000 Super Bowl. Its popular sock puppet advertising mascot was interviewed by &quot;People&quot; magazine and appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;.

Although sales rose dramatically due to the attention, the company failed to become profitable and became known as one of the biggest victims of the dot-com crash in 2000. Since 2001, the Pets.com domain has redirected to PetSmart&#x27;s website.

==History==
On November 21, 1994, the Pets.com domain name was registered by Pasadena-based entrepreneur Greg McLemore. The Pets.com website launched in early November 1998 as a spinoff of WebMagic and Pets.com was incorporated in February 1999. After its start by Greg McLemore and Eva Woodsmall, Pets.com was purchased in early 1999 by Julie Wainwright. Amazon.com was involved in Pets.com&#x27;s first round of venture funding, purchasing a majority 54% stake in the company. Amazon, along with Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and Bowman Capital Management invested $10.5 million into Pets.com in March 1999. The CEO of Pets.com, Julie Wainwright, said of Amazon&#x27;s investment, &quot;This is a marriage made in heaven&quot;. By October 2000, Amazon had a 30% stake in the company. Pets.com spent most of the venture funding on large warehouses and other shipment infrastructures, as well as purchasing their biggest online competitor at the time, Petstore.com in June 2000 for $10.6 million.

A regional advertising campaign using a variety of media began, which included television, radio, print, outdoor advertising and a Pets.com magazine, which had its first issue published in November 1999. The first issue was sent to 1 million pet owners in the United States during the month it was first published. Pets.com started with a five-city advertising campaign, which was expanded to 10 cities by Christmas 1999. The company succeeded in making its mascot, the Pets.com sock puppet, well known. The Pets.com site design was extremely well-received, garnering several advertising awards. In January 2000, the company aired its first national commercial as a Super Bowl ad which cost the company $1.2 million. That ad was ranked #5 by &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Ad Meter. The company went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange in February 2000 and raised $82.5 million; the former Nasdaq stock symbol was IPET.

Despite its success in building brand recognition, it was uncertain whether a substantial market niche existed for Pets.com. No independent market research preceded the launch of Pets.com. During its first fiscal year (February to September 1999), Pets.com earned $619,000 in revenue, and spent $11.8 million on advertising. Pets.com lacked a workable business plan and lost money on nearly every sale because, even before the cost of advertising, it was selling merchandise for approximately one-third the price it paid to obtain the products. Pets.com tried to build a customer base by offering discounts and free shipping, but it was impossible to turn a profit while absorbing the costs of shipping for heavy bags of cat litter and cans of pet food within a business field whose conventional profit margins are only two to four percent. The company hoped to shift customers into higher-margin purchases, but customer purchasing patterns failed to change and during its second fiscal year the company continued to sell merchandise for approximately 27% less than cost, so the dramatic rise in sales during Pets.com&#x27;s second fiscal year only hastened the firm&#x27;s demise.

In September 2000, Pets.com opened a new customer service call center in Greenwood, Indiana and relocated the majority of its customer work force to Indiana in order to cut costs. They aggressively undertook actions to sell the company. PetSmart offered less than the net cash value of the company, and Pets.com&#x27;s board turned down that offer. The company announced on November 7, 2000 that they would cease taking orders on November 9, 2000 at 11am PST and laid off 255 of their 320 employees. Pets.com had around 570,000 customers before its shutdown. Pets.com stock had fallen from its IPO price of $11 per share in February 2000 to $0.19 the day of its liquidation announcement. At its peak, the company had 320 employees, of which 250 were employed in the warehouses across the United States. While the offer from PetSmart was declined, some assets of Pets.com, including its domains, trademarks and subsidiaries such as Flying Fish Express, were sold to PetSmart in December 2000. As of 2025, the Pets.com domain redirects to PetSmart.com.

Wainwright and nine other executives stayed during the liquidation and held a stockholders&#x27; meeting on January 16, 2001 to finalize the liquidation. Wainwright received $235,000 in severance on top of a $225,000 &quot;retention payment&quot; while overseeing the closure. The company changed its name to IPET Holdings, Inc. on January 16, 2001 and liquidation of the company was completed on January 18.

=== Charity work ===
During the company&#x27;s existence, Pets.com partnered with Best Friends Animal Sanctuary to start a charity called &quot;Pets.commitment&quot;, which provided funding and support for animal shelters, animal therapy, service dog programs, pet care and wellness organizations. The charity&#x27;s motto was &quot;people helping animals, animals helping people.&quot; After the Pets.com website closed in November 2000, Pets.com donated more than 21 tons of dog food to help Mushers in Alaska&#x27;s Interior in December 2000.

==Sock puppet==
Pets.com hired the San Francisco office of TBWA\Chiat\Day to design its advertising campaign. The firm had recently created the popular Taco Bell chihuahua. For Pets.com, it designed a doglike sock puppet that carried a microphone in its paw. The puppet, performed by Michael Ian Black (an alumnus of MTV&#x27;s surrealist comedy sketch show &quot;The State&quot;), was a simple sock puppet with button eyes, flailing arms, a watch for a collar, and a stick microphone emblazoned with &quot;pets.com&quot;. The sock puppet first appeared in Pets.com&#x27;s advertising in August 1999.

As the puppet&#x27;s fame grew through 1999 and 2000, it gained almost cult status and widespread popularity. The puppet made an appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot;, WABC-TV-produced &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, was interviewed in &quot;People&quot; Magazine, &quot;Time&quot; Magazine, Entertainment Weekly and Adweek and even had a &quot;falloon&quot; made in its image for the 1999 Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. In addition to the media appearances the Pets.com puppet made, merchandising was also done for the company including clothing, other trinkets, and a retail version of the sock puppet that delivered some of the puppet&#x27;s famous lines, which started shipping on June 13, 2000. More than 10,000 puppets had been sold in its first week of availability and more than 35,000 puppets had been sold by late-July 2000. The Pets.com sock puppet toy was available until the website&#x27;s shutdown. The Pets.com sock puppet also had an “autobiography” of himself titled &quot;&quot;Me by Me&quot;,&quot; which was released in 2000, a coffee table book featuring a compilation of photos with quotes.

After Pets.com liquidated, Hakan and Associates and Bar None, Inc. purchased the rights to the puppet under a joint venture called Sock Puppet LLC for $125,000 in 2002. Bar None, Inc., an American automotive loan firm, gave the puppet a new slogan: &quot;Everyone deserves a second chance.&quot; and aired nine commercials featuring the puppet in July 2002.

=== Lawsuit ===
As Pets.com&#x27;s recognition began to grow, it attracted the attention of the creators of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. Representatives from Robert Smigel sent letters, including a cease and desist demand, to Pets.com claiming that the puppet was based on Triumph. Pets.com responded by suing Smigel in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco in April 2000, demanding $20 million in damages for defamation and trade libel.

Wainwright responded to the lawsuit, saying that &quot;We were surprised when we received the letter because there is obviously no relation between the Pets.com Sock Puppet and Triumph&quot;. Canadian sock puppet character Ed the Sock, who had previously accused Smigel of basing his Triumph character on himself, also used the incident for publicity.

The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2001 by Judge Charles R. Breyer.

== Legacy ==
The publicity surrounding the Pets.com puppet, combined with the company&#x27;s collapse, made it such a symbol of dot-com folly that E-Trade referred to it in an advertisement during the 2001 Super Bowl. The commercial, which parodies the famous crying Native public service advertisement from 1971, shows a chimpanzee riding on horseback through a ruined dot-com landscape. The chimpanzee comes across a company named &quot;eSocks.com&quot; that is being demolished and weeps when a discarded sock puppet lands at his feet.

In June 2008, CNET named Pets.com as one of the greatest dot-com disasters.

Pets.com&#x27;s concept was successfully realized by Chewy.com, prompting comparison between the two companies by analysts after Chewy held their IPO in 2019. Chewy&#x27;s founder Ryan Cohen rejects comparisons to Pets.com, telling Yahoo in 2019, &quot;That is an absolute crazy comparison. I think there’s really nothing in common between those two businesses.&quot;

<doc id="254543" wikidata="Q312973" url="?curid=254543" title="Nur al-Din Zengi">
<text>Nūr al-Dīn Maḥmūd Zengī (; February 1118 – 15 May 1174), commonly known as Nur ad-Din (lit. &#x27;Light of the Faith&#x27; in Arabic), was a Turkoman member of the Zengid dynasty, who ruled the Syrian province () of the Seljuk Empire. He reigned from 1146 to 1174. He is regarded as an important figure of the Second Crusade.

==War against Crusaders==

Nur ad-Din was the second son of Imad al-Din Zengi, the Turkoman &quot;atabeg&quot; of Aleppo and Mosul, who was a devoted enemy of the crusader presence in Syria. After the assassination of his father in 1146, Nur ad-Din and his older brother Saif ad-Din Ghazi I divided the kingdom between themselves, with Nur ad-Din governing Aleppo and Saif ad-Din Ghazi establishing himself in Mosul. The border between the two new kingdoms was formed by the Khabur River. Almost as soon as he began his rule, Nur ad-Din attacked the Principality of Antioch, seizing several castles in the north of Syria, while at the same time he defeated an attempt by Joscelin II to recover the County of Edessa, which had been conquered by Zengi in 1144. In 1146, after the Frankish attempt to reoccupy Edessa, Nur ad-Din massacred the local Armenian Christian population of the city and destroyed its fortifications, in punishment for assisting Joscelin in this attempt. The women and children of Edessa were enslaved.
Nur ad-Din sought to make alliances with his Muslim neighbours in northern Iraq and Syria in order to strengthen the Muslim front against their Crusader enemies. In 1147, he signed a bilateral treaty with Mu&#x27;in ad-Din Unur, governor of Damascus. As part of this agreement, he also married Mu&#x27;in ad-Din&#x27;s daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Together Mu&#x27;in ad-Din and Nur ad-Din besieged the cities of Bosra and Salkhad, which had been captured by a rebellious vassal of Mu&#x27;in ad-Din named Altuntash, but Mu&#x27;in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s intentions and did not want to offend his former crusader allies in Jerusalem, who had helped defend Damascus against Zengi. To reassure Mu&#x27;in ad-Din, Nur ad-Din curtailed his stay in Damascus and turned instead towards the Principality of Antioch, where he was able to seize Artah, Kafar Latha, Basarfut, and Bara.
In 1148, the Second Crusade arrived in Syria, led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Nur ad-Din&#x27;s victories and the Crusaders&#x27; losses in Asia Minor however had made the recovery of Edessa – their original goal – practically impossible. Given that Aleppo was too far off from Jerusalem for an attack and Damascus, recently allied with the Kingdom of Jerusalem against Zengi, had entered into an alliance with Nur ad-Din, the Crusaders decided to attack Damascus, the conquest of which would preclude a combination of Jerusalem&#x27;s enemies. Mu&#x27;in ad-Din threatened to turn the city over to Nur ad-Din if he was unable to defend it, but the crusader siege collapsed after only four days.

Nur ad-Din took advantage of the failure of the Crusade to prepare another attack against Antioch. In 1149, he launched an offensive against the territories dominated by the castle of Harim, situated on the eastern bank of the Orontes, after which he besieged the castle of Inab. The Prince of Antioch, Raymond of Poitiers, quickly came to the aid of the besieged citadel. The Muslim army destroyed the Crusader army at the Battle of Inab, during which Raymond was killed, moreover, Raymond&#x27;s head was sent to Nur ad-Din, who sent it along to the Caliph Al-Muqtafi in Baghdad. Nur ad-Din marched all the way to the coast and expressed his dominance of Syria by symbolically bathing in the Mediterranean. He did not, however, attack Antioch itself; he was content with capturing all Antiochene territory east of the Orontes and leaving a rump state around the city, which in any case soon fell under the suzerainty of the Byzantine Empire. In 1150, he defeated Joscelin II for a final time, after allying with the Seljuk Sultan of Rüm, Mas&#x27;ud (whose daughter he also married). Joscelin was blinded and died in his prison in Aleppo in 1159. In the Battle of Aintab, Nur ad-Din tried but failed to prevent King Baldwin III of Jerusalem&#x27;s evacuation of the Latin Christian residents of Turbessel. In 1152, Nur ad-Din captured and burned Tortosa, briefly occupying the town.

==Unification of sultanate==
It was Nur ad-Din&#x27;s dream to unite the various Muslim forces between the Euphrates and the Nile to make a common front against the crusaders. In 1149 Saif ad-Din Ghazi died, and a younger brother, Qutb ad-Din Mawdud, succeeded him. Qutb ad-Din recognized Nur ad-Din as overlord of Mosul, so that the major cities of Mosul and Aleppo were united under one man. Damascus was all that remained as an obstacle to the unification of Syria.

After the failure of the Second Crusade, Mu&#x27;in ad-Din had renewed his treaty with the crusaders, and after his death in 1149, his successor Mujir ad-Din Abaq followed the same policy. In 1150 and 1151, Nur ad-Din besieged the city, but retreated each time with no success, aside from empty recognition of his suzerainty. When Ascalon was captured by the crusaders in 1153, Mujir ad-Din forbade Nur ad-Din from travelling across his territory. Mujir ad-Din, however, was a weaker ruler than his predecessor, and he also agreed to pay an annual tribute to the crusaders in exchange for their protection. The growing weakness of Damascus under Mujir ad-Din allowed Nur ad-Din to overthrow him in 1154, with help from the population of the city. Damascus was annexed to Zengid territory, and all of Syria was unified under the authority of Nur ad-Din, from Edessa in the north to the Hauran in the south. Nur ad-Din was generous in his victory, and allowed Abaq to flee with his property, later granting him fiefdoms in the vicinity of Homs. He was cautious not to attack Jerusalem right away, and even continued to send the yearly tribute established by Mujir ad-Din; meanwhile he briefly became involved in affairs to the north of Mosul, where a succession dispute in the Sultanate of Rum threatened Edessa and other cities.

In 1157, Nur ad-Din besieged the Knights Hospitaller in the crusader fortress of Banias, routed a relief army from Jerusalem led by King Baldwin III, and captured Grand Master Bertrand de Blanquefort. However, he fell ill that year and the crusaders were given a brief respite from his attacks. In 1159, the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus arrived to assert his authority in Antioch, and the crusaders hoped he would send an expedition against Aleppo. However, Nur ad-Din sent ambassadors and negotiated an alliance with the emperor against the Seljuks, much to the crusaders&#x27; dismay. Nur ad-Din, along with the Danishmends of eastern Anatolia, attacked the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II from the east the next year, while Manuel attacked from the west. Later in 1160, Nur ad-Din captured the Prince of Antioch, Raynald of Châtillon after a raid in the Anti-Taurus mountains; Raynald remained in captivity for the next sixteen years. By 1162, with Antioch under nominal Byzantine control and the crusader states further south powerless to make any further attacks on Syria, Nur ad-Din made a pilgrimage to Mecca. Soon after he returned, he learned of the death of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem, and out of respect for such a formidable opponent he refrained from attacking the crusader kingdom: William of Tyre reports that Nur ad-Din said &quot;We should sympathize with their grief and in pity spare them, because they have lost a prince such as the rest of the world does not possess today.&quot;

===Conquest of Egypt===

As there was now nothing the crusaders could do in Syria, they were forced to look to the south if they wanted to expand their territory. The capture of Ascalon had already succeeded in cutting off Egypt from Syria, and Egypt had been politically weakened by a series of very young Fatimid caliphs. By 1163, the caliph was the young al-Adid, but the country was ruled by the vizier Shawar. That year, Shawar was overthrown by Dirgham; soon afterwards, the King of Jerusalem, Amalric I, led an offensive against Egypt, on the pretext that the Fatimids were not paying the tribute they had promised to pay during the reign of Baldwin III. This campaign failed and he was forced to return to Jerusalem, but it provoked Nur ad-Din to lead a campaign of his own against the crusaders in Syria in order to turn their attention away from Egypt. Nur ad-Din&#x27;s attack on Tripoli was unsuccessful, but he was soon visited by the exiled Shawar, who begged him to send an army and restore him to the vizierate. Nur ad-Din did not want to spare his own army for a defense of Egypt, but his Kurdish general Shirkuh was given permission to invade in 1164. In response, Dirgham allied with Amalric, but the king could not mobilize in time to save him. Dirgham was killed during Shirkuh&#x27;s invasion and Shawar was restored as vizier.

Shawar immediately expelled Shirkuh and allied with Amalric, who arrived to besiege Shirkuh at Bilbeis. Shirkuh agreed to abandon Egypt when Amalric was forced to return home, after Nur ad-Din attacked Antioch and besieged the castle of Harenc. There, Nur ad-Din routed the combined armies of Antioch and Tripoli and captured most of the Crusader armies&#x27; leadership, including Raymond III, Joscelin III and Bohemond III, leaving three major principalities of the Crusader states leaderless. However, he refused to attack Antioch itself, fearing reprisals from the Byzantines. Instead he besieged and captured Banias, and for the next two years continually raided the frontiers of the crusader states. In 1166, Nur ad-Din&#x27;s Kurdish general Shirkuh was sent again to Egypt. Amalric followed him at the beginning of 1167, and a formal treaty was established between Amalric and Shawar, with the nominal support of the caliph. The crusaders occupied Alexandria and Cairo and made Egypt a tributary state, but due to the unpopularity of the Egyptian alliance with the Crusaders, Shirkuh managed to take Alexandria without bloodshed. The Crusaders besieged Alexandria and famine set in quickly due to the city&#x27;s limited stores of food. Shirkuh organized a sortie and broke through the enemy lines, leaving command of Alexandria to his nephew, Saladin. In the same year, Nur ad-Din raided the County of Tripoli, in which he temporarily captured Areimeh Castle, Chastel Blanc and Gibelacar, exploiting the captivity of Raymond III. Ultimately, Amalric could not hold Egypt while Nur ad-Din still held Syria, and he was forced to return to Jerusalem. The siege of Alexandria was lifted, and Shirkuh&#x27;s forces withdrew from Egypt as well. 

In 1168, Amalric sought an alliance with Emperor Manuel and invaded Egypt once more. Shawar&#x27;s son Khalil had had enough, and with support from Caliph al-Adid requested help from Nur ad-Din and Shirkuh. At the beginning of 1169, Shirkuh arrived and the crusaders once more were forced to retreat. This time Nur ad-Din&#x27;s commander gained full control of Egypt. Shawar was executed and Shirkuh was named vizier of the newly conquered territory. Shirkuh died later that year and was succeeded by his nephew Saladin. One last invasion of Egypt was launched by Amalric and Manuel, but it was disorganized and came to nothing. Saladin continued to swear nominal fealty to Nur ad-Din until his death in 1174, but their relationship became increasingly tense. Saladin was reluctant to join forces with Nur ad-Din against Crusader armies or holdings, withdrawing his own armies on several occasions when Nur ad-Din&#x27;s forces arrived to assist him. Nur ad-Din&#x27;s insistence that Saladin abolish the Shia Caliphate further raised tensions between them. Saladin was reluctant to do so because the authority of the Caliphate in Egypt was a source of legitimacy for his rule. He feared popular backlash, and was bound by friendship and obligation to the Caliph al-Adid. Nonetheless, Saladin capitulated to Nur ad-Din and the Fatimid Caliphate was abolished in 1171.

==Death and succession==

During this time Nur ad-Din was busy in the north, fighting the Artuqids, and in 1170 he had to settle a dispute between his nephews when his brother Qutb ad-Din died. With Egypt conquered in his name, Nur ad-Din believed that he had accomplished his goal of uniting the Arab states of the Levant. However, near the end of his life, especially after the death of Saladin&#x27;s father Najm al-Din Ayyub, Nur ad-Din believed he could no longer trust anyone in Saladin&#x27;s court to maintain the young ruler&#x27;s fealty to him. Nur ad-Din began preparations to invade Egypt and depose Saladin, but he was seized by a fever due to complications from a peritonsillar abscess. He died at the age of 56 on 15 May 1174 in the Citadel of Damascus. He was initially buried there, before being reburied in the Nur al-Din Madrasa. His young son As-Salih Ismail al-Malik became his legitimate heir, and Saladin declared himself his vassal, maintaining the de jure unity of Syria and Egypt under As-Salih&#x27;s rule. When As-Salih died suddenly at the age of eighteen, Saladin defeated the other claimants to the throne and took power in Syria in 1185, uniting Syria and Egypt not just in name, as they were during Nur ad-Din&#x27;s reign, but in fact.

==Legacy==

According to William of Tyre, although Nur ad-Din was &quot;a mighty persecutor of the Christian name and faith,&quot; he was also &quot;a just prince, valiant and wise, and according to the traditions of his race, a religious man.&quot; His sense of justice was never denied to anyone, regardless of their creed or origins. As a result of his justice, a Christian foreigner was said to have settled into Damascus, which was under Nur ad-Din&#x27;s reign. Nur ad-Din was especially religious after his illness and his pilgrimage. He considered the crusaders foreigners in Muslim territory, who had come to Outremer to plunder the land and profane its sacred places. Nevertheless, he tolerated the Christians who lived under his authority, aside from the Armenians of Edessa, and regarded Emperor Manuel with deep respect. In contrast to Nur ad-Din&#x27;s respectful reaction to the death of Baldwin III, Amalric I immediately besieged Banias upon learning of the emir&#x27;s death, and extorted a vast amount of money from his widow.

During Nur ad-Din&#x27;s reign, forty-two madrasas were built in Syria, of which half he personally sponsored. Through the construction of these madrasas Nur ad-Din was ensuring the creation of Sunni Islamic qadis and imams. Nur ad-Din himself enjoyed having specialists read to him from the Hadith, and his professors even awarded him a diploma in Hadith narration. He had bimaristans (hospitals) constructed in his cities as well, one of them is Nur al-Din Bimaristan and built caravanserais on the roads for travelers and pilgrims. He held court several times a week so that people could seek justice from him against his generals, governors, or other employees who had committed some crime.
Nur ad-Din&#x27;s Sunni orthodoxy can be seen in his public works. His repair of the Roman aqueduct in Aleppo insinuated an anti-Shia polemic, and the conversion of two Shia mosques into madrasas, one Shafi&#x27;i another Hanafi, reinforce his insistence of promoting Sunni Islam. Consequently, in November 1148, he forbade the Shia call to prayer in Aleppo and any public displays of Shi&#x27;ism.

In the Muslim world he remains a legendary figure of military courage, piety, and modesty. Sir Steven Runciman said that he loved, above all else, justice.

The Damascene chronicler Ibn al-Qalanisi generally speaks of Nur ad-Din in majestic terms, although he himself died in 1160, and did not witness the later events of Nur ad-Din&#x27;s reign.

The Islamist group Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki, active in the Syrian Civil War in Aleppo since 2011, is named after Nur ad-Din.

<text>Presentation Manager (PM) is the graphical user interface (GUI) that IBM and Microsoft introduced in version 1.1 of their operating system OS/2 in late 1988.

==History==
Microsoft began developing a graphic user interface (GUI) in 1981. After it persuaded IBM that the latter also needed a GUI, Presentation Manager (PM; codenamed Winthorn) was co-developed by Microsoft and IBM&#x27;s Hursley Lab in 1987-1988. It was a cross between Microsoft Windows and IBM&#x27;s mainframe graphical system (GDDM). Like Windows, it was message based and many of the messages were even identical, but there were a number of significant differences as well. Although Presentation Manager was designed to be very similar to the upcoming Windows 2.0 from the user&#x27;s point of view, and Presentation Manager application structure was nearly identical to Windows application structure, source compatibility with Windows was not an objective. For Microsoft, the development of Presentation Manager was an opportunity to clean up some of the design mistakes of Windows. The two companies stated that Presentation Manager and Windows 2.0 would remain almost identical.

One of the most significant differences between Windows and PM was the coordinate system. While in Windows the 0,0 coordinate was located in the upper left corner, in PM it was in the lower left corner. Another difference was that all drawing operations went to the Device Context (DC) in Windows. PM also used DCs but there was an added level of abstraction called Presentation Space (PS). OS/2 also had more powerful drawing functions in its Graphics Programming Interface (GPI). Some of the GPI concepts (like viewing transforms) were later incorporated into Windows NT. The OS/2 programming model was thought to be cleaner, since there was no need to explicitly export the window procedure, no WinMain, and no non-standard function prologs and epilogs.

=== Parting ways ===

One of the most-cited reasons for the IBM-Microsoft split was the divergence of the APIs between Presentation Manager and Windows, which was probably driven by IBM. Initially, Presentation Manager was based on Windows GUI code, and often had developments performed in advance, like the support for proportional fonts (which appeared in Windows only in 1990). One of the divergences regarded the position of coordinate (0,0), which was at the top-left in Windows, but at bottom-left (as in Cartesian coordinates) in Presentation Manager. In practice it became impossible to recompile a GUI program to run on the other system; an automated source code conversion tool was promised at some point. Both companies were hoping that at some point users would migrate to OS/2.

In 1990, version 3.0 of Windows was beginning to sell in volume, and Microsoft began to lose interest in OS/2 especially since, even earlier, market interest in OS/2 was always much smaller than in Windows.

The companies parted ways, and IBM took over all of subsequent development. Microsoft took OS/2 3.0, which it renamed Windows NT; as such, it inherited certain characteristics of Presentation Manager. IBM continued to develop Presentation Manager. In subsequent versions of OS/2, and derivatives such as ArcaOS, it was used as a base for the object-oriented interface Workplace Shell.

There is a significant integration of the GUI layer with the rest of the system, but it is still possible to run certain parts of OS/2 from a text-console or X window, and it is possible to boot OS/2 into a command-line environment without Presentation Manager (e.g. using TSHELL ).

=== Presentation Manager for Unix ===

In the late 1980s, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft collaborated on an implementation of Presentation Manager for Unix systems running the X11 windowing system. The port consisted of two separate pieces of software - a toolkit, window manager and style guide named CXI (Common X Interface) and an implementation of the Presentation Manager API for Unix named PM/X. Both CXI and PM/X were submitted to the Open Software Foundation for consideration as OSF&#x27;s new user interface standard for Unix, which eventually became Motif. OSF ultimately selected CXI, but used Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s XUI API instead of PM/X. Microsoft and HP continued the development of PM/X for some time after the release of Motif, with Microsoft integrating the product into a joint development strategy with SCO to bring a common user interface to OS/2 and SCO&#x27;s Unix products, but it was ultimately abandoned.

==Technical details==
PM follows the Common User Access interface conventions.
It also supports mouse chording for copying and pasting text.

An important problem was that of the single input queue: a non-responsive application could block the processing of user-interface messages, thus freezing the graphical interface. This problem has been solved in Windows NT, where such an application would just become a dead rectangle on the screen; in later versions it became possible to move or hide it. In OS/2 it was solved in a FixPack, using a timer to determine when an application was not responding to events.

<text>Sancho Garcés III ( 992–996 – 18 October 1035), also known as Sancho the Great (, ), was the King of Pamplona from 1004 until his death in 1035. He also ruled the County of Aragon and by marriage the counties of Castile, Álava and Monzón. He later added the counties of Sobrarbe (1015), Ribagorza (1018) and Cea (1030), and would intervene in the Kingdom of León, taking its eponymous capital city in 1034.

He was the eldest son of García Sánchez II and his wife Jimena Fernández.

== Biography ==

=== Birth and succession ===
The year of Sancho&#x27;s birth is not known, but it is no earlier than 992 and no later than 996. His parents were García Sánchez II the Tremulous and Jimena Fernández, daughter of Fernando Bermúdez, count of Cea on the Leonese frontier. García and Jimena are first recorded as married in 992, but there is no record of their son Sancho until 996. The first record of the future king is a diploma of his father&#x27;s granting the village of Terrero to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla. The king describes Sancho merely as &quot;my son&quot; (&quot;filius meus&quot;). The same diploma also shows the future duke of Gascony, Sancho VI, at the court of Pamplona.

Sancho was raised in the monastery of Leyre. His father last appears in 1000, while Sancho is first found as king in 1004, inheriting the kingdom of Pamplona (later known as Navarre). This gap has led to speculation as to whether there was an interregnum, while one document shows Sancho Ramírez of Viguera reigning in Pamplona in 1002, perhaps ruling as had Jimeno Garcés during the youth of García Sánchez I three generations earlier. On his succession, Sancho initially ruled under a council of regency led by the bishops, his mother Jimena, and grandmother Urraca Fernández.

===Pyrenean politics===
Sancho aspired to unify the Christian principalities in the face of the fragmentation of Muslim Spain into the taifa kingdoms following the Battle of Calatañazor. In about 1010 he married Muniadona of Castile, daughter of Sancho García of Castile, and in 1015 he began a policy of expansion. He displaced Muslim control in the depopulated former county of Sobrarbe. In Ribagorza, another opportunity arose. The 1010 partition of the county left it divided between William Isarn, illegitimate son of count Isarn, and Raymond III of Pallars Jussà and his wife, Mayor García of Castile, who was both niece of Isarn and aunt of Sancho&#x27;s wife. In 1018, William Isarn tried to solidify his control over the Arán valley, but was killed, and Sancho jumped on the opportunity to take his portion, presumably based on some loose claim derived from his wife. Raymond and Mayor annulled their marriage, creating a further division finally resolved in 1025 when Mayor retired to a Castilian convent and Sancho received the submission of Raymond as vassal. He also forced Berengar Raymond I of Barcelona to become his vassal, though he was already a vassal of the French king. Berengar met Sancho in Zaragoza and in Navarre many times to confer on a mutual policy against the counts of Toulouse.

===Acquisition of Castile===

In 1016, Sancho fixed the border between Navarre and Castile, part of the good relationship he established by marrying Muniadona, daughter of Sancho García of Castile. In 1017, he became the protector of Castile for the young García Sánchez. However, relations between the three Christian entities of León, Castile, and Navarre soured after the assassination of Count García in 1027. He had been betrothed to Sancha, daughter of Alfonso V, who was set thus to gain from Castile lands between the rivers Cea and Pisuerga (as the price for approving the marital pact). As García arrived in León for his wedding, he was killed by the sons of a noble he had expelled from his lands.

Sancho III had opposed the wedding and the expected expansion of Leonese power to Castile, and used García&#x27;s death to reverse this. Using the pretext of the protectorship he had exercised over Castile, he immediately occupied the county and named as successor his own younger son Ferdinand, who was nephew of the deceased count, bringing it fully within his sphere of influence.

===Gascon suzerainty===
Sancho established relations with the Duchy of Gascony, probably of a suzerain–vassal nature, him being the suzerain. In consequence of his relationship with the monastery of Cluny, he improved the road from Gascony to León. This road would begin to bring increased traffic down to Iberia as pilgrims flocked to Santiago de Compostela. Because of this, Sancho ranks as one of the first great patrons of the Saint James Way.

Sancho VI of Gascony was a relative of King Sancho and spent a portion of his life at the royal court in Pamplona. He also partook alongside Sancho the Great in the Reconquista. In 1010, the two Sanchos appeared together with Robert II of France and William V of Aquitaine, neither of whom was the Gascon duke&#x27;s suzerain, at Saint-Jean d&#x27;Angély. After Sancho VI&#x27;s death in 1032, Sancho the Great extended his authority definitively into Gascony, where he began to mention his authority as extending as far as the Garonne in the documents issued by his chancery.

In southern Gascony, Sancho created a series of viscounties: Labourd (between 1021 and 1023), Bayonne (1025), and Baztán (also 1025).

===Acquisition of León===

After the succession of Bermudo III to León, Sancho negotiated the marriage of his son Ferdinand to Sancha, the former fiancée of García Sánchez and Bermudo&#x27;s sister, and along with it a dowry that included disputed Leonese lands. Sancho was soon engaged in a full-scale war with León, and combined Castilian and Navarrese armies quickly overran much of Bermudo&#x27;s kingdom, occupying Astorga. By March 1033, he was king from Zamora to the borders of Barcelona.

In 1034, even the city of León, the &quot;imperiale culmen&quot; (imperial capital, as Sancho saw it), fell, and there Sancho had himself crowned again. This was the height of Sancho&#x27;s rule which now extended from the borders of Galicia in the west to the county of Barcelona in the east. In 1035, he refounded the diocese of Palencia, which had been laid waste by the Moors. He gave the see and its several abbacies to Bernard, of French or Navarrese origin, to whom he also gave the secular lordship (as a &quot;feudum&quot;), which included many castles in the region. However, he died on 18 October 1035 and was buried in the monastery of San Salvador de Oña, an enclave in Burgos, under the inscription &quot;Sancius, gratia Dei, Hispaniarum rex&quot;.

===Succession===
Before his death in 1035, Sancho divided his possessions among his sons. Of the three surviving sons by Muniadona, the eldest, García, had already appeared as &quot;regulus&quot; in Navarre, inheriting the kingdom including the Basque country as well as exercising suzerainty over the kingdom&#x27;s lands given to his brothers. Gonzalo had been placed in control of the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, which he would hold as &quot;regulus&quot;. Ferdinand had been given Castile on the death of count García Sánchez in 1029, holding it first under his father and later of Vermudo III of León, before killing that king to take León and the royal title. Ramiro, the eldest but illegitimate son of Sancho by mistress Sancha of Aybar, was given property in the former county of Aragón with the provision that he should ask for no more lands of his brother García, under whom he first acted as &quot;baiulus&quot; but from whom he later achieved &quot;de facto&quot; independence. Documents report two further sons, a second Ramiro and Bernard, but scholarship is divided on whether they were legitimate sons who died in youth, or if their appearance instead results from either scribal error or forgery. Sancho left two daughters, Mayor and Jimena, the former perhaps the wife of Pons, Count of Toulouse, the latter the wife of Vermudo III.

==Legacy==

Taking residence in Nájera instead of the traditional capital of Pamplona, as his realm grew larger, he considered himself a European monarch, establishing relations on the other side of the Pyrenees.

He introduced French feudal theories and ecclesiastic and intellectual currents into Iberia. Through his close ties with the count of Barcelona and the duke of Gascony and his friendship with the monastic reformer Abbot Oliva, Sancho established relations with several of the leading figures north of the Pyrenees, most notably Robert II of France, William V of Aquitaine, William II and Alduin II of Angoulême, and Odo II of Blois and Champagne. It was through this circle that the Cluniac reforms first probably influenced his thinking. In 1024 a Navarrese monk, Paterno of San Juan de la Peña from Cluny, returned to Navarre and was made abbot of San Juan de la Peña, where he instituted the Cluniac custom and founded thus the first Cluniac house in Iberia west of Catalonia, under the patronage of Sancho. The Mozarabic rite continued to be practiced at San Juan, and the view that Sancho spread the Cluniac usage to other houses in his kingdom has been discredited by Justo Pérez de Urbel. Sancho sowed the seeds of the Cluniac reform and of the adoption of the Roman rite, but he did not widely enact them.

Sancho also began the Navarrese series of currency by minting what the Encyclopædia Britannica calls &quot;deniers of Carolingian influence.&quot; The division of his realm upon his death, the concepts of vassalage and suzerainty, and the use of the phrase &quot;by the grace of God&quot; (&quot;Dei gratia&quot;) after his title were imported from France, with which he tried to maintain relations. For this he has been called the &quot;first Europeaniser of Iberia.&quot;

His most obvious legacy, however, was the temporary union of all Christian Iberia. At least nominally, he ruled over León, the ancient capital of the kingdom won from the Moors in the eighth century, and Barcelona, the greatest of the Catalan cities. Though he divided the realm at his death, thus creating the enduring legacy of Castilian and Aragonese kingdoms, he left all his lands in the hands of one dynasty, the Jiménez, which kept the kingdoms allied by blood until the twelfth century. He made the Navarrese pocket kingdom strong, politically stable, and independent, preserving it for the remainder of the Middle Ages. It is for this that his seal has been appropriated by Basque nationalism, though, by dividing the realm, he isolated the kingdom and inhibited its ability to gain land at the expense of the Muslims. Summed up, his reign defined the political geography of Iberia until its union under the Catholic Monarchs.

==Titles==
Throughout his long reign, Sancho used a myriad of titles. After his coronation in León, he styled himself &quot;rex Dei gratia Hispaniarum&quot;, or &quot;by the grace of God, king of the Spains&quot;, and may have minted coins with the legend &quot;&quot;NAIARA/IMPERATOR&quot;. The use of the first title implied his kingship over all the independently founded Iberian kingdoms and the use of the form &quot;Dei gratia&quot;, adopted from French practice, stressed that his right to rule was of divine origin and sustenance. The latter, imperial title was only rarely employed, for it is not documented, being found only on coins only probably datable to his reign. It is not unlikely, however, that he desired to usurp the imperial title which the kings of León had thitherto carried.

Despite this, the contemporary ecclesiastic Abbot Oliva only ever acknowledged Sancho as &quot;rex Ibericus&quot; or &quot;rex Navarrae Hispaniarum&quot;, while he called both Alfonso V and Vermudo III emperor. The first title considers Sancho as king of all Iberia, as does the second, though it stresses his kingship over Navarre alone as if it had been extended to authority over the whole Christian portion of the peninsula. The near-contemporary writer Ibn Bassam, besides highlighting his virtues, calls him Lord of the Basques.

== Marriage and family ==
Sancho III was married to Muniadona of Castile, daughter of Sancho García of Castile, count of Castile and Álava. They had the following children:

* García Sánchez III, nicknamed &quot;the one from Nájera&quot;, King of Pamplona from 1035 until his death in 1054 and married to Stephanie of Foix.
* Fernando Sánchez, nicknamed &quot;the Great&quot;&quot;, already Count of Castile, he became King of León from 1037 until his 1065 death, being Emperor of all Spain from 1056, married to Sancha of León.
* Jimena Sánchez (Queen), Queen consort of León by her marriage to Bermudo III of León.
* Gonzalo Sánchez, petty king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza.

Before marrying Muniadona of Castile, Sancho III had a son with Sancha of Aibar:
*Ramiro Sánchez, initially receiving lands in Aragon, he would come to be viewed as the first King of Aragon after succeeding to his brother Gonzalo&#x27;s lands, he died in 1063.

<text>Roine Stolt (born 5 September 1956) is a Swedish guitarist, vocalist and composer. A major figure in Sweden&#x27;s rock history, Stolt led two of his country&#x27;s most successful progressive rock bands: Kaipa in the 1970s and The Flower Kings in the 1990s onward.

== Biography ==

Stolt started his career in the late 1960s playing bass guitar in local rock bands. He switched to guitar in 1973 in his brief sojourn with Allman Brothers-influenced Orexis. In 1974 he became the guitarist in Kaipa, a professional progressive rock band. He was 17 years old at that time. The group made three successful albums and toured more than 100 gigs a year, including national TV and radio performances in Scandinavia.

In 1979 he left Kaipa to form his own group Fantasia and made two albums. The group split up in 1983, and Stolt started working as a solo and session musician, arranger and producer.

In the late 80s he started his own publishing and recording label called Foxtrot Music. He was also involved in various projects including live performances and recording sessions with other artists, in styles ranging from symphonic rock towards more traditional rock, funk, pop, folk, blues and jazz. Under the &quot;Stolt&quot; project he released &quot;The Lonely Heartbeat&quot; in 1989: the sound is a mix of pop and complex rock.

Witnessing the progressive rock revival of the 1990s, a movement that partly originated from Sweden with bands like Landberk and Änglagård, Roine Stolt was quick to come back to his early love. Recruiting ex-Jonas Hellborg drummer Jaime Salazar and ex-Samla Mammas Manna percussionist Hasse Bruniusson, he released The Flower King in mid-August 1994. Stimulated by the warm response, he enlisted brother Michael Stolt (bass, vocals) and longtime friend Tomas Bodin (keyboards) and formed the Flower Kings, which would remain his principal musical project for years to come.

In 1998 he released his second solo album Hydrophonia. This reveals major influences by early progressive musicians such as Frank Zappa and Steve Howe.

In the year, 2000 Stolt worked in two different projects: the supergroup Transatlantic, and the re-launch of Kaipa, where he was involved in three albums from 2002–2005. He re-entered the studio with Transatlantic in 2009, for an album release later in the year.

In 2013, Stolt and The Flower Kings joined Neal Morse for a co-headlining tour. The members of both bands collaborated for an encore consisting of Transatlantic songs, as 3 of the 4 members of Transatlantic were present (Roine Stolt, Neal Morse, and Mike Portnoy).

In 2015 Stolt joined Steve Hackett&#x27;s touring band as bassist and guitarist for Hackett&#x27;s Acolyte to Wolflight with Genesis Revisited Tour.

On 24 June 2016, the duo Stolt and Jon Anderson had formed released their debut studio album entitled &quot;Invention of Knowledge&quot;.

In 2017, Stolt co-formed the supergroup The Sea Within.

<doc id="254598" wikidata="Q237338" url="?curid=254598" title="Seinen manga">
<text>is an editorial category of Japanese comics marketed toward young adult men. In Japanese, the word &quot;seinen&quot; means &quot;youth&quot;, but the term &quot;&quot;seinen&quot; manga&quot; is also used to describe the target audience of magazines like &quot;Weekly Manga Times&quot; and &quot;Weekly Manga Goraku,&quot; which write on topics of interest to male university students and workingmen. &quot;Seinen&quot; manga is distinguished from &quot;shōnen&quot; manga, which is for adolescent boys, and , which are intended for adult audiences and often contain explicit content. Some &quot;seinen&quot; manga like &quot;xxxHolic&quot; share similarities with &quot;shōnen&quot; manga. &quot;Seinen&quot; manga can focus on action, politics, science fiction, fantasy, relationships, sports, or comedy. The female equivalent to &quot;seinen&quot; manga is &quot;josei&quot; manga.

A common way to tell if a manga is &quot;seinen&quot; is by looking at whether &quot;furigana&quot; is used over the original kanji text: if there is &quot;furigana&quot; on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine in which it was published is also an important indicator. Usually, Japanese manga magazines with the word &quot;young&quot; in the title (&quot;Weekly Young Jump,&quot; for instance) are &quot;seinen&quot;. There are also mixed &quot;shōnen&quot;/&quot;seinen&quot; magazines such as &quot;Gangan Powered&quot; and &quot;Comp Ace&quot;. Other popular &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazines include &quot;Weekly Young Magazine&quot;, &quot;Weekly Young Sunday&quot;, &quot;Big Comic Spirits&quot;, &quot;Business Jump&quot;, &quot;Ultra Jump&quot;, and &quot;Afternoon&quot;.

In 1959, two of the main &quot;shōnen&quot; manga titles appeared: &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot;. Then, in 1967, the first magazine aimed at seinen appeared: &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;, which scored big hits with &quot;Lupin III&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot;, and later &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot;. The year 1972 saw the addition of &quot;Big Comic Original&quot;, which featured &quot;Tsuribaka Nisshi&quot;, a manga about two older men who enjoy fishing; the manga was made into a series of popular movies. In 1979, the publisher Shueisha, known for &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot; for teen boys, entered the &quot;seinen&quot; market with &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot;. Many &quot;Young Jump&quot; series have been adapted into anime or live-action TV programs, such as &quot;Elfen Lied&quot;, &quot;Gantz&quot;, &quot;Hen&quot;, &quot;Kirara&quot;, &quot;Liar Game&quot;, &quot;Oku-sama wa Joshi Kōsei&quot;, and Dragon Ball.

<doc id="254606" wikidata="Q10384130" url="?curid=254606" title="Transfer pricing">
<text>Transfer pricing refers to the rules and methods for pricing transactions within and between enterprises under common ownership or control. Because of the potential for cross-border controlled transactions to distort taxable income, tax authorities in many countries can adjust intragroup transfer prices that differ from what would have been charged by unrelated enterprises dealing at arm’s length (the arm’s-length principle). The OECD and World Bank recommend intragroup pricing rules based on the arm’s-length principle, and 19 of the 20 members of the G20 have adopted similar measures through bilateral treaties and domestic legislation, regulations, or administrative practice. Countries with transfer pricing legislation generally follow the &quot;OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations&quot; in most respects, although their rules can differ on some important details.
Where adopted, transfer pricing rules allow tax authorities to adjust prices for most cross-border intragroup transactions, including transfers of tangible or intangible property, services, and loans. For example, a tax authority may increase a company’s taxable income by reducing the price of goods purchased from an affiliated foreign manufacturer or raising the royalty the company must charge its foreign subsidiaries for rights to use a proprietary technology or brand name. These adjustments are generally calculated using one or more of the transfer pricing methods specified in the OECD guidelines and are subject to judicial review or other dispute resolution mechanisms.

Although transfer pricing is sometimes inaccurately presented by commentators as a tax avoidance practice or technique (transfer mispricing), the term refers to a set of substantive and administrative regulatory requirements imposed by governments on certain taxpayers. However, aggressive intragroup pricing – especially for debt and intangibles – has played a major role in corporate tax avoidance, and it was one of the issues identified when the OECD released its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) action plan in 2013. The OECD’s 2015 final BEPS reports called for country-by-country reporting and stricter rules for transfers of risk and intangibles but recommended continued adherence to the arm’s-length principle. These recommendations have been criticized by many taxpayers and professional service firms for departing from established principles and by some academics and advocacy groups for failing to make adequate changes.

Transfer pricing should not be conflated with fraudulent trade mis-invoicing, which is a technique for concealing illicit transfers by reporting falsified prices on invoices submitted to customs officials. “Because they often both involve mispricing, many aggressive tax avoidance schemes by multinational corporations can easily be confused with trade misinvoicing. However, they should be regarded as separate policy problems with separate solutions,” according to Global Financial Integrity, a non-profit research and advocacy group focused on countering illicit financial flows.

==In general==

Over sixty governments have adopted transfer pricing rules, which in almost all cases (with the notable exception of Kazakhstan) are based on the arm&#x27;s-length principle. The rules of nearly all countries permit related parties to set prices in any manner, but permit the tax authorities to adjust those prices (for purposes of computing tax liability) where the prices charged are outside an arm&#x27;s length range. Most, if not all, governments permit adjustments by the tax authority even where there is no intent to avoid or evade tax. The rules generally require that market level, functions, risks, and terms of sale of unrelated party transactions or activities be reasonably comparable to such items with respect to the related party transactions or profitability being tested.

Adjustment of prices is generally made by adjusting taxable income of all involved related parties within the jurisdiction, as well as adjusting any withholding or other taxes imposed on parties outside the jurisdiction. Such adjustments are generally made after filing of tax returns. For example, if Bigco US charges Bigco Germany for a machine, either the U.S. or German tax authorities may adjust the price upon examination of the respective tax return. Following an adjustment, the taxpayer generally is allowed (at least by the adjusting government) to make payments to reflect the adjusted prices.

Most systems allow use of transfer pricing multiple methods, where such methods are appropriate and are supported by reliable data, to test related party prices. Among the commonly used methods are comparable uncontrolled prices, cost-plus, resale price or markup, and profitability based methods. Many systems differentiate methods of testing goods from those for services or use of property due to inherent differences in business aspects of such broad types of transactions. Some systems provide mechanisms for sharing or allocation of costs of acquiring assets (including intangible assets) among related parties in a manner designed to reduce tax controversy. Most governments have granted authorization to their tax authorities to adjust prices charged between related parties. Many such authorizations, including those of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, allow domestic as well as international adjustments. Some authorizations apply only internationally.

In addition, most systems recognize that an arm&#x27;s length price may not be a particular price point but rather a range of prices. Some systems provide measures for evaluating whether a price within such range is considered arm&#x27;s length, such as the &quot;interquartile range&quot; used in U.S. regulations. Significant deviation among points in the range may indicate lack of reliability of data. Reliability is generally considered to be improved by use of multiple year data.

Most rules require that the tax authorities consider actual transactions between parties, and permit adjustment only to actual transactions. Multiple transactions may be aggregated or tested separately, and testing may use multiple year data. In addition, transactions whose economic substance differs materially from their form may be recharacterized under the laws of many systems to follow the economic substance.

Transfer pricing adjustments have been a feature of many tax systems since the 1930s. The United States led the development of detailed, comprehensive transfer pricing guidelines with a White Paper in 1988 and proposals in 1990–1992, which ultimately became regulations in 1994. In 1995, the OECD issued its transfer pricing guidelines which it expanded in 1996 and 2010. The two sets of guidelines are broadly similar and contain certain principles followed by many countries. The OECD guidelines have been formally adopted by many European Union countries with little or no modification.

==Comparability==

Most rules provide standards for when unrelated party prices, transactions, profitability or other items are considered sufficiently comparable in testing related party items. Such standards typically require that data used in comparisons be reliable and that the means used to compare produce a reliable result. The U.S. and OECD rules require that reliable adjustments must be made for all differences (if any) between related party items and purported comparables that could materially affect the condition being examined. Where such reliable adjustments cannot be made, the reliability of the comparison is in doubt. Comparability of tested prices with uncontrolled prices is generally considered enhanced by use of multiple data. Transactions not undertaken in the ordinary course of business generally are not considered to be comparable to those taken in the ordinary course of business. Among the factors that must be considered in determining comparability are:
*the contractual terms of the transaction, either formalized in written contract or not;
*the functions performed by each of the parties to the transaction taking into account assets used and risks assumed (so-called Functions, Assets, and Risks Analysis or FAR Analysis);
*the characteristics of property transferred or services provided, as difference in quality or the extent of service may affect price;
*the economic circumstances of the parties and of the market in which the parties operate, e.g. the geographic location, the extent of competition, and consumer purchasing power may result in different pricing even for the same goods and services; and
*the business strategies pursued by the parties, e.g. start-ups and mature businesses may have different pricing strategy, whether to focus on customer acquisition or profitability.

===Nature of property or services===

Comparability is best achieved where identical items are compared. However, in some cases it is possible to make reliable adjustments for differences in the particular items, such as differences in features or quality. For example, gold prices might be adjusted based on the weight of the actual gold (one ounce of 10 carat gold would be half the price of one ounce of 20 carat gold).

===Functions and risks===

Buyers and sellers may perform different functions related to the exchange and undertake different risks. For example, a seller of a machine may or may not provide a warranty. The price a buyer would pay will be affected by this difference. Among the functions and risks that may impact prices are:
*Product development
*Manufacturing and assembly
*Marketing and advertising
*Transportation and warehousing
*Credit risk
*Product obsolescence risk
*Market and entrepreneurial risks
*Collection risk
*Financial and currency risks
*Company- or industry-specific items

===Terms of sale===

Manner and terms of sale may have a material impact on price. For example, buyers will pay more if they can defer payment and buy in smaller quantities. Terms that may impact price include payment timing, warranty, volume discounts, duration of rights to use of the product, form of consideration, etc.

===Market level, economic conditions and geography===

Goods, services, or property may be provided to different levels of buyers or users: producer to wholesaler, wholesaler to wholesaler, wholesaler to retailer, or for ultimate consumption. Market conditions, and thus prices, vary greatly at these levels. In addition, prices may vary greatly between different economies or geographies. For example, a head of cauliflower at a retail market will command a vastly different price in unelectrified rural India than in Tokyo. Buyers or sellers may have different market shares that allow them to achieve volume discounts or exert sufficient pressure on the other party to lower prices. Where prices are to be compared, the putative comparables must be at the same market level, within the same or similar economic and geographic environments, and under the same or similar conditions.

===Testing of prices===
Tax authorities generally examine prices actually charged between related parties to determine whether adjustments are appropriate. Such examination is by comparison (testing) of such prices to comparable prices charged among unrelated parties. Such testing may occur only on examination of tax returns by the tax authority, or taxpayers may be required to conduct such testing themselves in advance of filing tax returns. Such testing requires a determination of how the testing must be conducted, referred to as a transfer pricing method.

====Best method rule====
Some systems give preference to a specific method of testing prices. OECD and U.S. systems, however, provide that the method used to test the appropriateness of related party prices should be that method that produces the most reliable measure of arm&#x27;s length results. This is often known as a &quot;best method&quot; rule. Factors to be considered include comparability of tested and independent items, reliability of available data and assumptions under the method, and validation of the results of the method by other methods.

====Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method====
The comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method is a transactional method that determines the arm&#x27;s-length price using the prices charged in comparable transactions between unrelated parties. In principle, the OECD and most countries that follow the OECD guidelines consider the CUP method to be the most direct method, provided that any differences between the controlled and uncontrolled transactions have no material effect on price or their effects can be estimated and corresponding price adjustments can be made. Adjustments may be appropriate where the controlled and uncontrolled transactions differ only in volume or terms; for example, an interest adjustment could be applied where the only difference is time for payment (e.g., 30 days vs. 60 days). For undifferentiated products such as commodities, price data for arm&#x27;s-length transactions (&quot;external comparables&quot;) between two or more other unrelated parties may be available. For other transactions, it may be possible to use comparable transactions (&quot;internal comparables&quot;) between the controlled party and unrelated parties.

The criteria for reliably applying the CUP method are often impossible to satisfy for licenses and other transactions involving unique intangible property, requiring use of valuation methods based on profit projections.

====Other transactional methods====
Among other methods relying on actual transactions (generally between one tested party and third parties) and not indices, aggregates, or market surveys are:
*Cost-plus (C+) method: goods or services provided to unrelated parties are consistently priced at actual cost plus a fixed markup. Testing is by comparison of the markup percentages.
*Resale price method (RPM): goods are regularly offered by a seller or purchased by a retailer to/from unrelated parties at a standard &quot;list&quot; price less a fixed discount. Testing is by comparison of the discount percentages.
*Gross margin method: similar to resale price method, recognised in a few systems.

====Profit-based methods====
Some methods of testing prices do not rely on actual transactions. Use of these methods may be necessary due to the lack of reliable data for transactional methods. In some cases, non-transactional methods may be more reliable than transactional methods because market and economic adjustments to transactions may not be reliable. These methods may include:
*Comparable profits method (CPM): profit levels of similarly situated companies in similar industries may be compared to an appropriate tested party. See U.S. rules below.
*Transactional net margin method (TNMM): while called a transactional method, the testing is based on profitability of similar businesses. See OECD guidelines below.
*Profit split method: total enterprise profits are split in a formulary manner based on econometric analyses.

CPM and TNMM have a practical advantage in ease of implementation. Both methods rely on microeconomic analysis of data rather than specific transactions. These methods are discussed further with respect to the U.S. and OECD systems.

Two methods are often provided for splitting profits: comparable profit split and residual profit split. The former requires that profit split be derived from the combined operating profit of uncontrolled taxpayers whose transactions and activities are comparable to the transactions and activities being tested. The residual profit split method requires a two step process: first profits are allocated to routine operations, then the residual profit is allocated based on nonroutine contributions of the parties. The residual allocation may be based on external market benchmarks or estimation based on capitalised costs.

====Tested party and profit level indicator====
Where testing of prices occurs on other than a purely transactional basis, such as CPM or TNMM, it may be necessary to determine which of the two related parties should be tested. Testing is to be done of that party testing of which will produce the most reliable results. Generally, this means that the tested party is that party with the most easily compared functions and risks. Comparing the tested party&#x27;s results to those of comparable parties may require adjustments to results of the tested party or the comparables for such items as levels of inventory or receivables.

Testing requires determination of what indication of profitability should be used. This may be net profit on the transaction, return on assets employed, or some other measure. Reliability is generally improved for TNMM and CPM by using a range of results and multiple year data.
this is based on circumstances of the relevant countries.

===Intangible property issues===
Valuable intangible property tends to be unique. Often there are no comparable items. The value added by use of intangibles may be represented in prices of goods or services, or by payment of fees (royalties) for use of the intangible property. Licensing of intangibles thus presents difficulties in identifying comparable items for testing. However, where the same property is licensed to independent parties, such license may provide comparable transactional prices. The profit split method specifically attempts to take value of intangibles into account.

===Services===
Enterprises may engage related or unrelated parties to provide services they need. Where the required services are available within a multinational group, there may be significant advantages to the enterprise as a whole for components of the group to perform those services. Two issues exist with respect to charges between related parties for services: whether services were actually performed which warrant payment, and the price charged for such services. Tax authorities in most major countries have, either formally or in practice, incorporated these queries into their examination of related party services transactions.

There may be tax advantages obtained for the group if one member charges another member for services, even where the member bearing the charge derives no benefit. To combat this, the rules of most systems allow the tax authorities to challenge whether the services allegedly performed actually benefit the member charged. The inquiry may focus on whether services were indeed performed as well as who benefited from the services. For this purpose, some rules differentiate stewardship services from other services. Stewardship services are generally those that an investor would incur for its own benefit in managing its investments. Charges to the investee for such services are generally inappropriate. Where services were not performed or where the related party bearing the charge derived no direct benefit, tax authorities may disallow the charge altogether.

Where the services were performed and provided benefit for the related party bearing a charge for such services, tax rules also permit adjustment to the price charged. Rules for testing prices of services may differ somewhat from rules for testing prices charged for goods due to the inherent differences between provision of services and sale of goods. The OECD Guidelines provide that the provisions relating to goods should be applied with minor modifications and additional considerations. In the U.S., a different set of price testing methods is provided for services. In both cases, standards of comparability and other matters apply to both goods and services.

It is common for enterprises to perform services for themselves (or for their components) that support their primary business. Examples include accounting, legal, and computer services for those enterprises not engaged in the business of providing such services. Transfer pricing rules recognize that it may be inappropriate for a component of an enterprise performing such services for another component to earn a profit on such services. Testing of prices charged in such case may be referred to a cost of services or services cost method. Application of this method may be limited under the rules of certain countries, and is required in some countries e.g. Canada.

Where services performed are of a nature performed by the enterprise (or the performing or receiving component) as a key aspect of its business, OECD and U.S. rules provide that some level of profit is appropriate to the service performing component. Canada&#x27;s rules do not permit such profit. Testing of prices in such cases generally follows one of the methods described above for goods. The cost-plus method, in particular, may be favored by tax authorities and taxpayers due to ease of administration.

===Cost sharing===
Multi-component enterprises may find significant business advantage to sharing the costs of developing or acquiring certain assets, particularly intangible assets. Detailed U.S. rules provide that members of a group may enter into a cost sharing agreement (CSA) with respect to costs and benefits from the development of intangible assets. OECD Guidelines provide more generalized suggestions to tax authorities for enforcement related to cost contribution agreements (CCAs) with respect to acquisition of various types of assets. Both sets of rules generally provide that costs should be allocated among members based on respective anticipated benefits. Inter-member charges should then be made so that each member bears only its share of such allocated costs. Since the allocations must inherently be made based on expectations of future events, the mechanism for allocation must provide for prospective adjustments where prior projections of events have proved incorrect. However, both sets of rules generally prohibit applying hindsight in making allocations.

A key requirement to limit adjustments related to costs of developing intangible assets is that there must be a written agreement in place among the members. Tax rules may impose additional contractual, documentation, accounting, and reporting requirements on participants of a CSA or CCA, which vary by country.

Generally, under a CSA or CCA, each participating member must be entitled to use of some portion rights developed pursuant to the agreement without further payments. Thus, a CCA participant should be entitled to use a process developed under the CCA without payment of royalties. Ownership of the rights need not be transferred to the participants. The division of rights is generally to be based on some observable measure, such as by geography.

Participants in CSAs and CCAs may contribute pre-existing assets or rights for use in the development of assets. Such contribution may be referred to as a platform contribution. Such contribution is generally considered a deemed payment by the contributing member, and is itself subject to transfer pricing rules or special CSA rules.

A key consideration in a CSA or CCA is what costs development or acquisition costs should be subject to the agreement. This may be specified under the agreement, but is also subject to adjustment by tax authorities.

In determining reasonably anticipated benefits, participants are forced to make projections of future events. Such projections are inherently uncertain. Further, there may exist uncertainty as to how such benefits should be measured. One manner of determining such anticipated benefits is to project respective sales or gross margins of participants, measured in a common currency, or sales in units.

Both sets of rules recognize that participants may enter or leave a CSA or CCA. Upon such events, the rules require that members make buy-in or buy-out payments. Such payments may be required to represent the market value of the existing state of development, or may be computed under cost recovery or market capitalization models.

===Penalties and documentation===
Some jurisdictions impose significant penalties relating to transfer pricing adjustments by tax authorities. These penalties may have thresholds for the basic imposition of penalty, and the penalty may be increased at other thresholds. For example, U.S. rules impose a 20% penalty where the adjustment exceeds US$5 million, increased to 40% of the additional tax where the adjustment exceeds US$20 million.

The rules of many countries require taxpayers to document that prices charged are within the prices permitted under the transfer pricing rules. Where such documentation is not timely prepared, penalties may be imposed, as above. Documentation may be required to be in place prior to filing a tax return in order to avoid these penalties. Documentation by a taxpayer need not be relied upon by the tax authority in any jurisdiction permitting adjustment of prices. Some systems allow the tax authority to disregard information not timely provided by taxpayers, including such advance documentation. India requires that documentation not only be in place prior to filing a return, but also that the documentation be certified by the chartered accountant preparing a company return.

==U.S. specific tax rules==
U.S. transfer pricing rules are lengthy. They incorporate all of the principles above, using CPM (see below) instead of TNMM. U.S. rules specifically provide that a taxpayer&#x27;s intent to avoid or evade tax is not a prerequisite to adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service, nor are nonrecognition provisions. The U.S. rules give no priority to any particular method of testing prices, requiring instead explicit analysis to determine the best method. U.S. comparability standards limit use of adjustments for business strategies in testing prices to clearly defined market share strategies, but permit limited consideration of location savings.

===Comparable profits method===
The Comparable Profits method (CPM) was introduced in the 1992 proposed regulations and has been a prominent feature of IRS transfer pricing practice since. Under CPM, the tested party&#x27;s overall results, rather than its transactions, are compared with the overall results of similarly situated enterprises for whom reliable data is available. Comparisons are made for the profit level indicator that most reliably represents profitability for the type of business. For example, a sales company&#x27;s profitability may be most reliably measured as a return on sales (pre-tax profit as a percent of sales).

CPM inherently requires lower levels of comparability in the nature of the goods or services. Further, data used for CPM generally can be readily obtained in the U.S. and many countries through public filings of comparable enterprises.

Results of the tested party or comparable enterprises may require adjustment to achieve comparability. Such adjustments may include effective interest adjustments for customer financing or debt levels, inventory adjustments, etc.

===Cost plus and resale price issues===
U.S. rules apply resale price method and cost-plus with respect to goods strictly on a transactional basis. Thus, comparable transactions must be found for all tested transactions in order to apply these methods. Industry averages or statistical measures are not permitted. Where a manufacturing entity provides contract manufacturing for both related and unrelated parties, it may readily have reliable data on comparable transactions. However, absent such in-house comparables, it is often difficult to obtain reliable data for applying cost-plus.

The rules on services expand cost-plus, providing an additional option to mitigate these data problems. Charges to related parties for services not in the primary business of either the tested party or the related party group are rebuttably presumed to be arm&#x27;s length if priced at cost plus zero (the services cost method). Such services may include back-room operations (e.g., accounting and data processing services for groups not engaged in providing such services to clients), product testing, or a variety of such non-integral services. This method is not permitted for manufacturing, reselling, and certain other services that typically are integral to a business.

U.S. rules also specifically permit shared services agreements. Under such agreements, various group members may perform services which benefit more than one member. Prices charged are considered arm&#x27;s length where the costs are allocated in a consistent manner among the members based on reasonably anticipated benefits. For instance, shared services costs may be allocated among members based on a formula involving expected or actual sales or a combination of factors.

===Terms between parties===
Under U.S. rules, actual conduct of the parties is more important than contractual terms. Where the conduct of the parties differs from terms of the contract, the IRS has authority to deem the actual terms to be those needed to permit the actual conduct.

===Adjustments===
U.S. rules require that the IRS may not adjust prices found to be within the arm&#x27;s length range. Where prices charged are outside that range, prices may be adjusted by the IRS unilaterally to the midpoint of the range. The burden of proof that a transfer pricing adjustment by the IRS is incorrect is on the taxpayer unless the IRS adjustment is shown to be arbitrary and capricious. However, the courts have generally required both taxpayers and the IRS to demonstrate their facts where agreement is not reached.

===Documentation and penalties===
If the IRS adjusts prices by more than $5 million or 10 percent of the taxpayer’s gross receipts, penalties apply. The penalty is 20% of the amount of the tax adjustment, increased to 40% at a higher threshold.

This penalty may be avoided only if the taxpayer maintains contemporaneous documentation meeting requirements in the regulations, and provides such documentation to the IRS within 30 days of IRS request. If documentation is not provided at all, the IRS may make adjustments based on any information it has available. Contemporaneous means the documentation existed with 30 days of filing the taxpayer&#x27;s tax return. Documentation requirements are quite specific, and generally require a best method analysis and detailed support for the pricing and methodology used for testing such pricing. To qualify, the documentation must reasonably support the prices used in computing tax.

===Commensurate with income standard===
U.S. tax law requires that the foreign transferee/user of intangible property (patents, processes, trademarks, know-how, etc.) will be deemed to pay to a controlling transferor/developer a royalty commensurate with the income derived from using the intangible property. This applies whether such royalty is actually paid or not. This requirement may result in withholding tax on deemed payments for use of intangible property in the U.S.

==OECD specific tax rules==
OECD guidelines are voluntary for member nations. Some nations have adopted the guidelines almost unchanged. Terminology may vary between adopting nations, and may vary from that used above.

OECD guidelines give priority to transactional methods, described as the &quot;most direct way&quot; to establish comparability. The Transactional Net Margin Method and Profit Split methods are used either as methods of last resort or where traditional transactional methods cannot be reliably applied. CUP is not given priority among transactional methods in OECD guidelines. The Guidelines state, &quot;It may be difficult to find a transaction between independent enterprises that is similar enough to a controlled transaction such that no differences have a material effect on price.&quot; Thus, adjustments are often required to either tested prices or uncontrolled process.

===Comparability standards===
OECD rules permit consideration of business strategies in determining if results or transactions are comparable. Such strategies include market penetration, expansion of market share, cost or location savings, etc.

===Transactional net margin method===
The transactional net margin method (TNMM) compares the net profitability of a transaction, or group or aggregation of transactions, to that of another transaction, group or aggregation. Under TNMM, use of actual, verifiable transactions is given strong preference. However, in practice TNMM allows making computations for company-level aggregates of transactions. Thus, TNMM may in some circumstances function like U.S. CPM.

===Terms===
Contractual terms and transactions between parties are to be respected under OECD rules unless both the substance of the transactions differs materially from those terms and following such terms would impede tax administration.

===Adjustments===
OECD rules generally do not permit tax authorities to make adjustments if prices charged between related parties are within the arm&#x27;s length range. Where prices are outside such range, the prices may be adjusted to the most appropriate point. The burden of proof of the appropriateness of an adjustment is generally on the tax authority.

===Documentation===
OECD Guidelines do not provide specific rules on the nature of taxpayer documentation. Such matters are left to individual member nations.

==EU==
In 2002, the European Union created the EU Joint Transfer Pricing Forum. The Communication on &quot;Tax and Development – Cooperating with Developing Countries in Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters‟, COM (2010) 163 final, highlighted the need to support developing countries&#x27; capacity in mobilizing domestic resources for development in line with the principles of good governance in taxation. In this context, PwC prepared the report &quot;Transfer pricing and developing countries&quot;.

Many EU countries are currently implementing the OECD Guidelines for Transfer Pricing. The latest adopter is Cyprus which issued a ruling in 2017 for financial arrangements.

==China specific tax rules==

Prior to 2009, China generally followed OECD Guidelines. New guidelines were announced by the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) in March 2008 and issued in January 2009. These guidelines differed materially in approach from those in other countries in two principal ways: 1) they were guidelines issued instructing field offices how to conduct transfer pricing examinations and adjustments, and 2) factors to be examined differed by transfer pricing method. The guidelines covered:
*Administrative matters
*Required taxpayer filings and documentation
*General transfer pricing principles, including comparability
*Guidelines on how to conduct examinations
*Advance pricing and cost sharing agreement administration
*Controlled foreign corporation examinations
*Thin capitalization
*General anti-avoidance
On September 17, 2015, the SAT released a revised draft version of the &quot;Implementation Measures for Special Tax Adjustment (Circular 2),&quot; which replaced the previous 2009 guidelines. Three new sections were introduced under the revised draft: monitoring and management, intangible transactions/intra-group services and a new approach to transfer pricing documentation.

===Documentation===
Under the 2009 Circular, taxpayers must disclose related party transactions when filing tax returns. In addition, the circular provides for a three-tier set of documentation and reporting standards, based on the aggregate amount of intercompany transactions. Taxpayers affected by the rules who engaged in intercompany transactions under RMB 20 million for the year were generally exempted from reporting, documentation, and penalties. Those with transactions exceeding RMB 200 million generally were required to complete transfer pricing studies in advance of filing tax returns. For taxpayers in the top tier, documentation must include a comparability analysis and justification for the transfer pricing method chosen.

The 2015 draft introduced an overhauled three-tiered standardized approach to transfer pricing documentation. The tiers vary in documentation content and include the master file, the local file, and the country-by-country report. The draft also requires companies involved with related-party service transactions, cost sharing agreements or thin capitalization to submit a so-called &quot;Special File.&quot;

===General principles===
Chinese transfer pricing rules apply to transactions between a Chinese business and domestic and foreign related parties. A related party includes enterprises meeting one of eight different tests, including 25% equity ownership in common, overlapping boards or management, significant debt holdings, and other tests. Transactions subject to the guidelines include most sorts of dealings businesses may have with one another.

The Circular instructs field examiners to review taxpayer&#x27;s comparability and method analyses. The method of analyzing comparability and what factors are to be considered varies slightly by type of transfer pricing analysis method. The guidelines for CUP include specific functions and risks to be analyzed for each type of transaction (goods, rentals, licensing, financing, and services). The guidelines for resale price, cost-plus, transactional net margin method, and profit split are short and very general.

===Cost sharing===
The China rules provide a general framework for cost sharing agreements. This includes a basic structure for agreements, provision for buy-in and exit payments based on reasonable amounts, minimum operating period of 20 years, and mandatory notification of the SAT within 30 days of concluding the agreement.

==Agreements between taxpayers and governments and dispute resolution==
Tax authorities of most major countries have entered into unilateral or multilateral agreements between taxpayers and other governments regarding the setting or testing of related party prices. These agreements are referred to as advance pricing agreements or advance pricing arrangements (APAs). Under an APA, the taxpayer and one or more governments agree on the methodology used to test prices. APAs are generally based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by the taxpayer and presented to the government(s). Multilateral agreements require negotiations between the governments, conducted through their designated competent authority groups. The agreements are generally for some period of years, and may have retroactive effect. Most such agreements are not subject to public disclosure rules. Rules controlling how and when a taxpayer or tax authority may commence APA proceedings vary by jurisdiction.

==Economic theory==

The discussion in this section explains an economic theory behind optimal transfer pricing with &quot;optimal&quot; defined as transfer pricing that maximizes overall firm profits in a non-realistic world with no taxes, no capital risk, no development risk, no externalities or any other frictions which exist in the real world. In practice a great many factors influence the transfer prices that are used by multinational corporations, including performance measurement, capabilities of accounting systems, import quotas, customs duties, VAT, taxes on profits, and (in many cases) simple lack of attention to the pricing.

From marginal price determination theory, the optimum level of output is that where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. That is to say, a firm should expand its output as long as the marginal revenue from additional sales is greater than their marginal costs. In the diagram that follows, this intersection is represented by point A, which will yield a price of P*, given the demand at point B.

When a firm is selling some of its product to itself, and only to itself (i.e. there is no external market for that particular transfer good), then the picture gets more complicated, but the outcome remains the same. The demand curve remains the same. The optimum price and quantity remain the same. But marginal cost of production can be separated from the firm&#x27;s total marginal costs. Likewise, the marginal revenue associated with the production division can be separated from the marginal revenue for the total firm. This is referred to as the net marginal revenue in production (NMR) and is calculated as the marginal revenue from the firm minus the marginal costs of distribution.

It can be shown algebraically that the intersection of the firm&#x27;s marginal cost curve and marginal revenue curve (point A) must occur at the same quantity as the intersection of the production division&#x27;s marginal cost curve with the net marginal revenue from production (point C).

If the production division is able to sell the transfer good in a competitive market (as well as internally), then again both must operate where their marginal costs equal their marginal revenue, for profit maximization. Because the external market is competitive, the firm is a price taker and must accept the transfer price determined by market forces (their marginal revenue from transfer and demand for transfer products becomes the transfer price). If the market price is relatively high (as in Ptr1 in the next diagram), then the firm will experience an internal surplus (excess internal supply) equal to the amount Qt1 minus Qf1. The actual marginal cost curve is defined by points A,C,D.
If the firm is able to sell its transfer goods in an imperfect market, then it need not be a price taker. There are two markets each with its own price (Pf and Pt in the next diagram). The aggregate market is constructed from the first two. That is, point C is a horizontal summation of points A and B (and likewise for all other points on the net marginal revenue curve (NMRa)). The total optimum quantity (Q) is the sum of Qf plus Qt.

== Alternative approaches to profit allocation ==
A frequently-proposed alternative to arm&#x27;s-length principle-based transfer pricing rules is formulary apportionment, under which corporate profits are allocated according to objective metrics of activity such as sales, employees, or fixed assets. Some countries (including Canada and the United States) allocate taxing rights among their political subdivisions in this way, and it has recommended by the European Commission for use within the European Union. According to the &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief, filed by the attorneys general of Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon in support of the state of California in the U.S. Supreme Court case of &quot;Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board,&quot; the formulary apportionment method, which is also known as the unitary apportionment method, has at least three major advantages over the separate accounting system when applied to multi-jurisdictional businesses. First, the unitary method captures the added wealth and value resulting from economic interdependencies of multistate and multinational corporations through their functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale. A unitary business also benefits from more intangible values shared among its constituent parts, such as reputation, good will, customers and other business relationships. See, e.g., Mobil, 445 U.S. at 438–40; Container, 463 U.S. at 164–65.

Separate accounting, with its emphasis on carving out of the overall business only income from sources within a single state, ignores the value attributable to the integrated nature of the business. Yet, to a large degree, the wealth, power, and profits of the world&#x27;s large multinational enterprises are attributable to the very fact that they are integrated, unitary businesses. Hellerstein Treatise, P8.03 at 8-32.n9 As one commentator has explained: To believe that multinational corporations do not maintain an advantage over independent corporations operating within a similar business sphere is to ignore the economic and political strength of the multinational giants. By attempting to treat those businesses which are in fact unitary as independent entities, separate accounting &quot;operates in a universe of pretense; as in Alice in Wonderland, it turns reality into fancy and then pretends it is the real world&quot;.

Because countries impose different corporate tax rates, a corporation that has a goal of minimizing the overall taxes to be paid will set transfer prices to allocate more of the worldwide profit to lower tax countries. Many countries attempt to impose penalties on corporations if the countries consider that they are being deprived of taxes on otherwise taxable profit. However, since the participating countries are sovereign entities, obtaining data and initiating meaningful actions to limit tax avoidance is hard. A publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states, &quot;Transfer prices are significant for both taxpayers and tax administrations because they determine in large part the income and expenses, and therefore taxable profits, of associated enterprises in different tax jurisdictions.&quot;

<text>A shtick is a comic theme or gimmick. The word entered the English language from the Yiddish &quot;shtik&quot; (שטיק), related to German &quot;Stück&quot;, Polish &quot;sztuka&quot;, Cyrillic &quot;штука&quot; (all ultimately from Proto-Germanic *&quot;stukkiją&quot;), all meaning &quot;piece&quot;, &quot;thing&quot; or &quot;theatre play&quot;; &quot;Theaterstück&quot; is the German word for play (and is a synonym of &quot;Schauspiel&quot;, literally &quot;viewing play&quot; in contrast to &quot;Singspiel&quot;).

The English word &quot;piece&quot; is sometimes used in a similar context (for example, a musical piece). In stand-up comedy context a near equivalent term is a &quot;bit&quot;. Another variant is &quot;bits of business&quot; or just &quot;bits&quot;. &quot;Shtick&quot; may refer to an adopted persona, usually for comedy performances, that is maintained consistently (though not necessarily exclusively) across the performer&#x27;s career. In this usage, the recurring personalities adopted by Laurel and Hardy through all of their many comedy films (although they often played characters with different names and occupations) would qualify as their shtick. A comedian might maintain several different shticks of this sort, particularly if appearing in a variety show encouraging development of multiple characters, such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In common usage, the word &quot;shtick&quot; has also come to mean any talent, style, habit, or other eccentricity for which a person is particularly well known, even if not intended for comedic purposes. For example, a person who is known locally for an ability to eat dozens of hot dogs quickly might say that it was his shtick. Among Orthodox Jews, &quot;shtick&quot; can also refer to wedding shtick, in which wedding guests entertain the bride and groom through dancing, costumes, juggling, and silliness.

Because of its roots in show business, &quot;shtick&quot; has taken on the connotation of a contrived and often-used act. For this reason, journalists and commentators often apply the word disparagingly to stock replies from politicians.

<text>Antonello da Messina (; 1425–1430February 1479), properly Antonello di Giovanni di Antonio, but also called Antonello degli Antoni and Anglicized as Anthony of Messina, was an Italian painter from Messina, active during the Italian Early Renaissance.

His work shows strong influences from Early Netherlandish painting, although there is no documentary evidence that he ever travelled beyond Italy. Giorgio Vasari credited him with the introduction of oil painting into Italy, although this is now regarded as wrong. Unusually for a southern Italian artist of the Renaissance, his work proved influential on painters in northern Italy, especially in Venice.

==Biography==

===Early life and training===

Antonello was born at Messina around 1429–1431, to Garita (Margherita) and Giovanni de Antonio Mazonus, a sculptor who trained him early on. He and his family resided in the Sicofanti district of the city.

Antonello is thought to have apprenticed in Rome before going to Naples, where Netherlandish painting was then fashionable. According to a letter written in 1524 by the Neapolitan humanist Pietro Summonte, in about 1450 Antonello was a pupil of the painter Niccolò Colantonio in Naples. This account of his training is accepted by most art historians.

===Early career===
Antonello returned to Messina from Naples during the 1450s. In around 1455, he painted the so-called &quot;Sibiu Crucifixion&quot;, inspired by Flemish treatments of the subject, which is now in the Muzeul de Artă in Bucharest. A &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the Royal Museum of Antwerp dates from the same period. These early works shows a marked Flemish influence, which is now understood to be inspired by his master Colantonio and from paintings by Rogier van der Weyden and Jan van Eyck that belonged to Colantonio&#x27;s patron, Alfonso V of Aragon. 
In his biography of the artist, Giorgio Vasari remarked that Antonello saw an oil painting by Van Eyck (the &quot;Lomellini Tryptych&quot;) belonging to King Alfonso V of Aragon at Naples and consequently introduced oil painting to Italy. Recent evidence indicates that an &quot;Antonello di Sicilia&quot; (di Sicilia meaning &#x27;from Sicily&#x27;) was in contact with Van Eyck&#x27;s most accomplished follower, Petrus Christus, in Milan in early 1456. It appears likely that this was in fact Antonello da Messina as this would explain why he was one of the first Italians to master Eyckian oil painting, and why Petrus Christus was the first Netherlandish painter to learn Italian linear perspective. Antonello&#x27;s paintings after that date show an observation of almost microscopic detail and of minute gradations of light on reflecting or light absorbent objects that is very close to the style of the Netherlandish masters, suggesting that Antonello was personally instructed by Christus. Also, the calmer expressions on human faces and calmness in the overall composition of Antonello&#x27;s works appear to be owing to a Netherlandish influence. He is believed to have shared Van Eyck&#x27;s techniques with Gentile and Giovanni Bellini.

Between the years of 1456 and 1457, Antonello proved himself to be a master painter in Messina. He also shared his home with Paolo di Ciacio, a student from Calabria. The artist&#x27;s earliest documented commission, in 1457, was for a banner for the Confraternità di San Michele dei Gerbini in Reggio Calabria, where he set up a workshop for the production of such banners and devotional images. At this date, he was already married, and his son Jacobello had been born.

In 1460, his father is mentioned leasing a brigantine to bring back Antonello and his family from Amantea in Calabria. In that year, Antonello painted the so-called &quot;Salting Madonna&quot;, in which standard iconography and Flemish style are combined with a greater attention in the volumetric proportions of the figures, probably indicating a knowledge of works by Piero della Francesca. Also from around 1460 are two small panels depicting &quot;Abraham Served by the Angels&quot; and &quot;St. Jerome Penitent&quot; now in the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia in Reggio Calabria. In 1461 Antonello&#x27;s younger brother Giordano entered his workshop, signing a three-year contract. In that year Antonello painted a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;, now lost, for the Messinese nobleman Giovanni Mirulla.

Historians believe that Antonello painted his first portraits in the late 1460s. They follow a Netherlandish model, the subject being shown bust-length, against a dark background, full face or in three-quarter view, while most previous Italian painters had adopted the medal-style profile pose for individual portraits. John Pope-Hennessy described Antonello as &quot;the first Italian painter for whom the individual portrait was an art form in its own right&quot;.
Although Antonello is mentioned in many documents between 1460 and 1465, establishing his presence in Messina in those years, a gap in the sources between 1465 and 1471 suggests that he may have spent these years on the mainland. In 1474, he painted the &quot;Annunciation&quot;, now in Syracuse, and the &quot;St. Jerome in His Study&quot; also dates from around this time.

===Venice===
Antonello went to Venice in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476. His works of this period begin to show a greater attention to the human figure, regarding both anatomy and expressivity, indicating the influence of Piero della Francesca and Giovanni Bellini. His most famous pictures from this period include the &quot;Condottiero&quot; (Louvre), the &quot;San Cassiano Altarpiece&quot; and the &quot;St. Sebastian&quot;. The &quot;San Cassiano Altarpiece&quot; was especially influential on Venetian painters, as it was one of the first of the large compositions in the &quot;sacra conversazione&quot; format which was perfected by Giovanni Bellini (Antonello&#x27;s surviving work in Vienna is only a fragment of a much larger original). It is also likely that Antonello passed on both the techniques of using oil paints and the principles of calmness on subjects&#x27; faces and in the composition of paintings to Giovanni Bellini and other Venetian painters during that visit. While in Venice he was offered, but did not accept, the opportunity to become the court portrait painter to the Duke of Milan.

===Return to Messina and death===
Antonello had returned to Sicily by September 1476. Works from near the end of his life include the famous &quot;Virgin Annunciate&quot;, now in the Palazzo Abatellis in Palermo, and the San Gregorio Polyptych.

He died at Messina in 1479. His testament dates from February of that year, and he is documented as no longer alive two months later. Some of his last works remained unfinished, but were completed by his son Jacobello.
==Style and legacy==
Antonello&#x27;s style is remarkable for its union of Italian simplicity with Flemish concern for detail. He exercised an enormous influence on Italian painting, not only by the introduction of the Flemish invention, but also by the transmission of Flemish tendencies. However, no school of painting formed after his death, with the exception of the Sicilian Marco Costanzo.

<doc id="254610" wikidata="Q208190" url="?curid=254610" title="Ketuvim">
<text>The  (; ) is the third and final section of the Hebrew Bible, after the (&quot;instruction&quot;) and the &quot;Prophets&quot;. In English translations of the Hebrew Bible, this section is usually titled &quot;Writings&quot; or &quot;Hagiographa&quot;.

In the Ketuvim, 1–2 Chronicles form one book as do Ezra and Nehemiah which form a single unit entitled Ezra–Nehemiah. (In citations by chapter and verse, however, the Hebrew equivalents of &quot;Nehemiah&quot;, &quot;I Chronicles&quot; and &quot;II Chronicles&quot; are used, as the system of chapter division was imported from Christian usage.) Collectively, eleven books are included in the Ketuvim.

== Groups of books ==
===&quot;Sifrei Emet&quot;===

In Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet ( – an acronym of the titles of the three books in Hebrew, , , yields e&quot;m&quot;&quot;et&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;).

These three books are also the only ones in the Hebrew Bible with a special system of cantillation that is designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses. However, the beginning and end of the book of Job are in the normal prose system.

===Five Megillot===
The five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Five Megillot (&quot;Hamesh Megillot&quot;/ Five Scrolls). These are the latest books collected and designated as &quot;authoritative&quot; in the Jewish canon. These scrolls are traditionally read over the course of the year in many Jewish communities. The list below presents them in the order they are read in the synagogue on holidays, beginning with the Song of Songs on Passover.

===Other books===
The remaining books in the Ketuvim are the Book of Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and the Books of Chronicles. These books share a number of distinguishing characteristics:
* The Talmudic tradition ascribes late authorship to all of them.
* Daniel and Ezra are the only books in the Hebrew Bible with significant portions in Biblical Aramaic.
* These two also describe relatively late events (i.e., the Babylonian captivity and the subsequent restoration of Zion).

== Order of the books ==

The following list presents the books of the Ketuvim in the order they appear in most printed editions. It also divides them into three subgroups based on the distinctiveness of &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot; and &quot;Hamesh Megillot&quot;.

The &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot;:
* &quot;Tehillim&quot; (Psalms) 
* &quot;Mishlei&quot; (Proverbs) 
* &quot;Iyyôbh&quot; (Job) 
The Five &quot;Megillot&quot;
* &quot;Shīr Hashīrīm&quot; (Song of Songs) (Passover)
* &quot;Rūth&quot; (Ruth) (Shavuot)
* &quot;Eikhah&quot; (Lamentations) (Tisha B&#x27;Av or Yom Kippur; also called &quot;Kinnot&quot; in Hebrew)
* &quot;Qōheleth&quot; (Ecclesiastes) (Sukkot)
* &quot;Estēr&quot; (Esther) (Purim)
Other books
* &quot;Dānî’ēl&quot; (Daniel) 
* &quot;‘Ezrā&quot; (Ezra–Nehemiah) 
* &quot;Divrei ha-Yamim&quot; (Chronicles) 

The Jewish textual tradition never finalized the order of the books in the Ketuvim. The Babylonian Talmud (Bava Batra 14b–15a) gives their order as Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, and Chronicles.

In Tiberian Masoretic codices, including the Aleppo Codex and the Leningrad Codex, and often in old Spanish manuscripts as well, the order is Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, and Ezra.

== Canonization ==

The Ketuvim is the last of the three portions of the Tanakh to have been accepted as Biblical canon. There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed: some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty, while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later.

While the Torah may have been considered canon by Israel as early as the 5th century BCE and the Former and Latter Prophets were canonized by the 2nd century BCE, Michael Coogan says that the Ketuvim was not a fixed canon until the 2nd century CE. According to T. Henshaw, as early as 132 BCE some references suggesting that the Ketuvim was starting to take shape, though it lacked a formal title. Jacob Neusner argues that the notion of a biblical canon was not prominent in 2nd-century Rabbinic Judaism or even later.

&quot;Against Apion&quot;, the writing of Josephus in 95 CE, treated the text of the Hebrew Bible as a closed canon to which &quot;no one has ventured either to add, or to remove, or to alter a syllable&quot;; Michael Barber, however, avers that Josephus&#x27; canon is &quot;not identical to that of the modern Hebrew Bible&quot;. For a long time, following this date, the divine inspiration of Esther, the Song of Songs, and Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) was often under scrutiny.

In the 20th century, many scholars seemed to believe that the limits of the Ketuvim as canonized scripture were determined by the Council of Jamnia ( 90 CE). But the theory of the Council of Jamnia is largely discredited today.

== Liturgical use ==

There is no formal system of synagogal reading of Ketuvim equivalent to the Torah portion and &quot;haftarah&quot;. It is thought that there was once a cycle for reading the Psalms, parallel to the triennial cycle for Torah reading, as the number of psalms (150) is similar to the number of Torah portions in that cycle, and remnants of this tradition exist in Italy. All Jewish liturgies contain copious extracts from the Psalms, but these are normally sung to a regular recitative or rhythmic tune rather than read or chanted. Some communities also have a custom of reading Proverbs in the weeks following Pesach, and Job on the Ninth of Ab.

The five megillot are read on the festivals, as mentioned above, though Sephardim have no custom of public reading of Song of Songs on Passover or Ecclesiastes on Sukkot. There are traces of an early custom of reading a &quot;haftarah&quot; from Ketuvim on Shabbat afternoons, but this does not survive in any community. Some Reform communities that operate a triennial cycle choose &quot;haftarot&quot; on Shabbat morning from Ketuvim as well as Neviim.

===Extraliturgical public reading===

In some Near and Middle Eastern Jewish traditions, the whole of Ketuvim (as well as the rest of the Tanakh and the Mishnah) is read each year on a weekly rota, usually on Shabbat afternoons. These reading sessions are not considered to be synagogue services, and often took place in the synagogue courtyard.

===Cantillation===
Medieval sources speak of three cantillation melodies, for Torah, Nevi&#x27;im and Ketuvim respectively. Today the position is more complicated. Oriental Sephardic communities preserve cantillation systems for the three poetic books, namely Psalms, Proverbs and the main part of Job (usually a different melody for each of the three books). No such systems exist in the Ashkenazi or Spanish and Portuguese traditions. However, the Ashkenazic yeshiva known as Aderet Eliyahu, in the Old City of Jerusalem, uses an adaptation of the Syrian cantillation-melody for these books, and this is becoming more popular among other Ashkenazim as well.

In all communities there are special cantillation melodies for Lamentations and Esther, and in some communities for the Song of Songs. Otherwise, the melody for the book of Ruth is considered the &quot;default&quot; melody for books of the Ketuvim not otherwise provided for. The &quot;prose&quot; passages at the beginning and end of the book of Job, as read on Tisha B&#x27;Av, may be read either to the tune of Ruth or to one resembling that for the Song of Songs.

== Targum to Ketuvim ==
Western targumim exist on &quot;Sifrei Emet&quot;, on the Five Megillot and on Chronicles, i.e. on all the books of Ketuvim besides Daniel and Ezra (which contain large portions in Aramaic anyway). There are several complementary targumim to Esther.

There is, however, no &quot;official&quot; eastern (Babylonian) targum to Ketuvim, equivalent to Targum Onkelos on the Torah and Targum Jonathan on Nevi&#x27;im. In fact, the Babylonian Talmud explicitly notes the lack of a Targum to Ketuvim, explaining that Jonathan ben Uzziel was divinely prevented from completing his translation of the Bible. A more prosaic explanation may consist in the lack of regular formal readings of Ketuvim in the synagogue (except the five Megillot), making it unnecessary to have an official system for line-by-line translation.

<doc id="254627" wikidata="Q237607" url="?curid=254627" title="Nellie Melba">
<text>Dame Nellie Melba (born Helen Porter Mitchell; 19 May 186123 February 1931) was an Australian operatic lyric coloratura soprano. She became one of the most famous singers of the late Victorian era and the early twentieth century, and was the first Australian to achieve international recognition as a classical musician. She took the pseudonym &quot;Melba&quot; from Melbourne, her home town.

Melba studied singing in Melbourne and made a modest success in performances there. After a brief and unsuccessful marriage, she moved to Europe in search of a singing career. Failing to find engagements in London, England, in 1886, she studied in Paris, France, and soon made a great success there and in Brussels, Belgium. Returning to London, she quickly established herself as the leading lyric soprano at Covent Garden from 1888. She soon achieved further success in Paris and elsewhere in Europe, and later at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, debuting there in 1893. Her repertoire was small; in her whole career she sang no more than 25 roles and was closely identified with only 10. She was known for her performances in French and Italian opera, but sang little German opera.

During the First World War, Melba raised large sums for war charities. She returned to Australia frequently during the 20th century, singing in opera and concerts, and had a house built for her near Melbourne. She was active in the teaching of singing at the Melbourne Conservatorium. Melba continued to sing until the last months of her life and made a large number of &quot;farewell&quot; appearances. Her death, in Australia, was news across the English-speaking world, and her funeral was a major national event. The Australian $100 note features her image.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Melba was born in Richmond, Victoria, the eldest of seven children of the builder David Mitchell and his wife Isabella Ann &quot;née&quot; Dow (1833–1881). Mitchell emigrated from Forfarshire, Scotland, to Australia in 1852, married Isabella in 1856 and became a successful builder. Melba was taught to play the piano and first sang in public around age six. She was educated at a local boarding school and then at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College. She studied singing with Mary Ellen Christian (a former pupil of Manuel García) and Pietro Cecchi, an Italian tenor, who was a respected teacher in Melbourne. In her teens, Melba continued to perform in amateur concerts in and around Melbourne, and she played the organ at church. Her father encouraged her in her musical studies, but he strongly disapproved of her taking up singing as a career. Melba&#x27;s mother died suddenly in 1881 at Richmond.

Melba&#x27;s father moved the family to Mackay, Queensland, where he built a new sugar mill. Melba soon became popular in Mackay society for her singing and piano-playing. On 22 December 1882 in Brisbane, she married Charles Nesbitt Frederick Armstrong (1858–1948), the youngest son of Sir Andrew Armstrong. They had one child, a son, George, born on 16 October 1883. The marriage was not a success; Charles reportedly beat his wife more than once. The couple separated after just over a year, and Melba returned to Melbourne determined to pursue a singing career, debuting professionally in concerts in 1884. She was often accompanied in concert, and some of her concerts were organised, at times throughout her career by the flautist John Lemmone, who became a &quot;lifelong friend and counsellor&quot;. On the strength of local success, she travelled to London in search of an opportunity. Her debut at the Princes&#x27; Hall in 1886 made little impression, and she sought work unsuccessfully from Sir Arthur Sullivan, Carl Rosa and Augustus Harris. She then went to Paris to study with the leading teacher Mathilde Marchesi, who instantly recognised the young singer&#x27;s potential: she exclaimed, &quot;J&#x27;ai enfin une étoile!&quot; (&quot;I have a star at last!&quot;). Melba made such rapid progress that she was allowed to sing the &quot;Mad Scene&quot; from Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; at a &quot;matinée musicale&quot; in Marchesi&#x27;s house in December the same year, in the presence of the composer.

The young singer&#x27;s talent was so evident that, after less than a year with Marchesi, the impresario Maurice Strakosch gave her a ten-year contract at 1000 francs annually. After she had signed, she received a far better offer of 3000 francs per month from the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, but Strakosch would not release her and obtained an injunction preventing her from accepting it. She was in despair when the matter was resolved by Strakosch&#x27;s sudden death. She made her operatic debut four days later as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; at La Monnaie on 12 October 1887. The critic Herman Klein described her Gilda as &quot;an instant triumph of the most emphatic kind ... followed ... a few nights later with an equal success as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;.&quot; It was at this time, on Marchesi&#x27;s advice, that she adopted the stage name of &quot;Melba&quot;, a contraction of the name of her home city.

===London, Paris and New York debuts===

Melba made her Covent Garden début in May 1888, in the title role in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. She received a friendly but not excited reception. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Madame Melba is a fluent vocalist, and a quite respectable representative of light soprano parts; but she lacks the personal charm necessary to a great figure on the lyric stage.&quot; She was offended when Augustus Harris, then in charge at Covent Garden, offered her only the small role of the page Oscar in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; for the next season. She left England vowing never to return. The following year, she performed at the Opéra in Paris, in the role of Ophélie in &quot;Hamlet&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; described this as &quot;a brilliant success&quot;, and said, &quot;Madame Melba has a voice of great flexibility ... her acting is expressive and striking.&quot;

Melba had a strong supporter in London, Lady de Grey, whose views carried weight at Covent Garden. Melba was persuaded to return, and Harris cast her in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (June 1889) co-starring with Jean de Reszke. She later recalled, &quot;I date my success in London quite distinctly from the great night of 15 June 1889.&quot; After this, she returned to Paris as Ophélie, Lucia in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot;, and Juliette. In French operas her pronunciation was poor, but the composer Delibes said that he did not care whether she sang in French, Italian, German, English or Chinese, as long as she sang.
In the early 1890s, Melba embarked on an affair with Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans. They were seen frequently together in London, which excited some gossip, but far more suspicion arose when Melba travelled across Europe to St Petersburg to sing for Tsar Nicholas II: the Duke followed closely behind her, and they were spotted together in Paris, Brussels, Vienna and St Petersburg. Armstrong filed divorce proceedings on the grounds of Melba&#x27;s adultery, naming the Duke as co-respondent; he was eventually persuaded to drop the case, but the Duke decided that a two-year African safari (without Melba) would be appropriate. He and Melba did not resume their relationship. In the first years of the decade, Melba appeared in the leading European opera houses, including Milan, Berlin and Vienna.

Melba sang the role of Nedda in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; at Covent Garden in 1893, soon after its Italian premiere. The composer was present and said that the role had never been so well played before. In December of that year, Melba sang at the Metropolitan Opera in New York for the first time. As at her Covent Garden debut, she appeared as Lucia di Lammermoor and, as at Covent Garden, it was less than a triumph. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised her performance – &quot;one of the loveliest voices that ever issued from a human throat ... simply delicious in its fullness, richness and purity&quot; – but the work was out of fashion, and the performances were poorly attended. Her performance in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, later in the season, was a triumph and established her as the leading prima donna of the time in succession to Adelina Patti. She had at first been nonplussed by the impenetrable snobbery at the Metropolitan; the author Peter Conrad has written, &quot;In London she hobnobbed with royalty; in New York she was a singing menial.&quot; Assured of critical success, she set herself to achieve social recognition, and succeeded.
From the 1890s, Melba played a wide range of parts at Covent Garden, mostly in the lyric soprano repertoire, but with some heavier roles also. She sang the title roles in Herman Bemberg&#x27;s &quot;Elaine&quot; and Arthur Goring Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Esmeralda&quot;. Her Italian parts included Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the title role in &quot;Aida&quot;, Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot;, Luisa in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;I Rantzau&quot;, Nedda in &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, and Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;. In the French repertoire, she sang Juliette in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, Marguerite in &quot;Faust&quot;, Marguerite de Valois in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, the title role in Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Hélène&quot;, which was written for her, and Micaëla in &quot;Carmen&quot;.

Some writers expressed surprise at Melba&#x27;s playing the last of these roles, since it was merely a supporting part in the opera. She played it on many occasions, saying in her memoirs, &quot;Why on earth a prima donna should not sing secondary &quot;rôles&quot; I could not see then and am no nearer seeing to-day. I hate the artistic snobbery of it.&quot; She sang the role opposite the Carmens of Emma Calvé, Zélie de Lussan and Maria Gay. Marguerite de Valois, too, is not the leading female role in &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, but Melba was willing to undertake it as &quot;seconda donna&quot; to Emma Albani. She was generous in support of singers who did not rival her in her favoured roles, but was, as her biographer J. B. Steane put it, &quot;pathologically critical&quot; of other lyric sopranos.

Melba was not known as a Wagner singer, although she occasionally sang Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. She received a certain amount of praise in these roles, although Klein found her unsuited to them, and Bernard Shaw thought she sang with great skill but played artificially and without sensibility. In 1896 at the Metropolitan, she attempted the role of Brünnhilde in &quot;Siegfried&quot;, in which she was not a success. Her most frequent role in that house was Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which she had studied under the supervision of the composer. She never essayed any of Mozart&#x27;s operas, for which some thought her voice ideally suited. Her repertoire across her entire career amounted to no more than 25 roles, of which, &quot;The Times&quot; obituarist wrote, &quot;only some 10 parts are those which will be remembered as her own.&quot;

Melba&#x27;s marriage to Armstrong was finally terminated when, having emigrated to the United States with their son, he divorced her in Texas in 1900.

===Twentieth century===

By now established as a leading star in Britain and America, Melba made her first return visit to Australia in 1902–03 for a concert tour, also touring in New Zealand. The profits were unprecedented; she returned for four more tours during her career. In Britain, Melba campaigned on behalf of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. She had first sung the part of Mimì in 1899, having studied it with the composer. She argued strongly for further productions of the work in the face of the distaste expressed by the Covent Garden management at this &quot;new and plebeian opera&quot;. She was vindicated by the public enthusiasm for the piece, which was bolstered in 1902 when Enrico Caruso joined her in the first of many Covent Garden performances together. She sang Mimì for Oscar Hammerstein I at his opera house in New York, in 1907, giving the enterprise a needed boost. After her initial successes in Brussels and Paris in the 1880s, Melba sang infrequently on the European continent; only the English-speaking countries welcomed her wholeheartedly.

She performed 26 times at the Royal Albert Hall in London between 1898 and 1926. Although she called Covent Garden &quot;my artistic home&quot;, her appearances there became less frequent in the 20th century. One reason for this was that she did not get on well with Sir Thomas Beecham, who was in control of the opera house for much of the period from 1910 until her retirement. She said, &quot;I dislike Beecham and his methods&quot;, and he thought that while she had &quot;nearly all the attributes inseparable from great artistry ... she was wanting in a genuine spiritual refinement.&quot; Another factor in her reduced appearances at Covent Garden was the appearance on the scene of Luisa Tetrazzini, a soprano ten years her junior, who became a great success in London and later in New York in roles previously associated with Melba. A third reason was her decision to spend more time in Australia. In 1909 she undertook what she called a &quot;sentimental tour&quot; of Australia, covering 10,000 miles (16,000 km) and including many remote towns. In 1911 in partnership with the J. C. Williamson company, she appeared in an operatic season. Her attitude to her tour concerts and the audiences attending was summed up in the advice that Clara Butt said Melba gave her apropos of a planned Australian tour: &quot;Sing &#x27;em muck; it&#x27;s all they can understand.&quot; To another colleague and compatriot, Peter Dawson, she described his home city of Adelaide as &quot;that city of the three P&#x27;s – Parsons, Pubs and Prostitutes.&quot;
In 1909, Melba bought property at Coldstream, a small town near Melbourne, and in 1912 she had a home built there (extending an existing cottage) that she named Coombe Cottage after a house she had rented near London. She also set up a music school in Richmond, which she later merged into the Melbourne Conservatorium. She was in Australia when the First World War broke out, and she threw herself into fund-raising for war charities, raising £100,000. In recognition of this, she was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in March 1918, &quot;for services in organising patriotic work&quot;.

After the war, Melba made a triumphant return to the Royal Opera House, in a performance of &quot;La bohème&quot; conducted by Beecham, which re-opened the house after four years of closure. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Probably no season at Covent Garden has ever started with quite the thrill of enthusiasm which passed through the house.&quot; In her many concerts, however, her repertoire was regarded as trite and predictable. After one of them &quot;The Musical Times&quot; wrote:

In 1922, Melba returned to Australia, where she sang at the immensely successful &quot;Concerts for the People&quot; in Melbourne and Sydney, with low ticket prices, attracting 70,000 people. In 1924 for another Williamson opera season, she caused resentment among local singers by importing an entire chorus from Naples. In 1926 she made her farewell appearance at Covent Garden, singing in scenes from &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, and &quot;La bohème&quot;. She is well remembered in Australia for her seemingly endless series of &quot;farewell&quot; appearances, including stage performances in the mid-1920s and concerts in Sydney on 7 August 1928, Melbourne on 27 September 1928 and Geelong in November 1928. From this, she is remembered in the vernacular Australian expression &quot;more farewells than Dame Nellie Melba&quot;.

In 1929 she returned for the last time to Europe and then visited Egypt, where she contracted a fever that she never entirely shook off. Her last performance was in London at a charity concert on 10 June 1930. She returned to Australia but died in St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney, in 1931, aged 69, of septicaemia which had developed after facial surgery in Europe some time before. She was given an elaborate funeral from Scots&#x27; Church, Melbourne, which her father had built and where as a teenager she had sung in the choir. The funeral motorcade was over a kilometre long, and her death made front-page headlines in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Europe. Billboards in many countries said simply &quot;Melba is dead&quot;. Part of the event was filmed for posterity. Melba was buried in the cemetery at Lilydale, near Coldstream. Her headstone, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, bears the farewell words of Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;: &quot;&quot; (Farewell, without bitterness).
==Teacher and patron==
Despite the antipathy Melba inspired in some of her peers, she helped the careers of younger singers. She taught for many years at the Conservatorium in Melbourne and looked for a &quot;new Melba&quot;. She published a book about her methods, which were based on those of Marchesi. The book opens:

Others also benefited from Melba&#x27;s praise and interest. She passed her own cadenzas on to a young Gertrude Johnson, a valuable professional asset. In 1924, Melba brought the new star Toti Dal Monte, fresh from triumphs in Milan and Paris but still unheard in England or the United States, to Australia as a principal of the Melba-Williamson Grand Opera Company. After sharing the Covent Garden stage in a 1923 night of operatic extracts with another Australian soprano, Florence Austral (who, as a dramatic soprano, posed no threat to Melba, a lyric soprano), Melba was effusive with her praise, describing the younger woman as &quot;one of the wonder-voices of the world&quot;. She similarly described the American contralto Louise Homer as possessing &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful voice&quot;. She gave financial assistance to the Australian painter Hugh Ramsay, living in poverty in Paris and also helped him to forge connections in the artistic world. The Australian baritone John Brownlee and tenor Browning Mummery were both protégés: both sang with her in her 1926 Covent Garden farewell (recorded by His Master&#x27;s Voice), and Brownlee sang with her on two of her last commercial recordings later that year (a session arranged by her in part to promote Brownlee).

==Recordings and broadcasts==

Melba&#x27;s first recordings were made around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York. A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: &quot;The next cylinder was labelled &#x27;Melba&#x27; and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above the staff and were rich and clear.&quot; Melba was less impressed: &quot;&#x27;Never again,&#x27; I said to myself as I listened to the scratching, screeching result. &#x27;Don&#x27;t tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.&#x27;&quot; The recordings never reached the general public – destroyed on Melba&#x27;s orders, it is suspected – and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years. Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances. These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something of the quality of the young Melba&#x27;s voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.

Melba made numerous gramophone (phonograph) records of her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone &amp; Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects the limitations of the early days of commercial sound recording. Melba&#x27;s acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed – albeit to a limited degree – in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation. Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall says of her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set. Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba&#x27;s exceptional purity of tone was probably one of the principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.
Melba&#x27;s farewell to Covent Garden on 8 June 1926 was recorded by His Master&#x27;s Voice, as well as broadcast. The programme included Act 2 of &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (not recorded because the tenor Charles Hackett was not under contract to His Master&#x27;s Voice), followed by the opening of Act 4 of &quot;Otello&quot; (Desdemona&#x27;s &quot;Willow Song&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot;) and Acts 3 and 4 of &quot;La bohème&quot; (with Aurora Rettore, Browning Mummery, John Brownlee and others). The conductor was Vincenzo Bellezza. At the conclusion Lord Stanley of Alderley made a formal address and Melba gave an emotional farewell speech. In a pioneering venture, eleven sides (78rpm) were recorded via a landline to Gloucester House (London), though in the event only three of these were published. The full series (including both speeches) was included in a 1976 His Master&#x27;s Voice reissue.

As was the case in many of her performances, most of Melba&#x27;s recordings were made at &quot;French Pitch&quot; (A=435 Hz), rather than the British early 20th century standard of A=452 Hz, or the modern standard of A=440 Hz. This, and the technical inadequacies of the early recording process (discs were frequently recorded faster or slower than the supposed standard of 78rpm, whilst the conditions of the cramped recording studios – kept very warm to keep the wax at the necessary softness when cutting – would wreak havoc with instrumental tuning during recording sessions), means that playing her recordings back in the speed and pitch she made them at is not always a simple matter.

On 15 June 1920, Melba was heard in a pioneering radio broadcast from Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s New Street Works factory in Chelmsford, singing two arias and her famous trill. She was the first artist of international renown to participate in direct radio broadcasts. Radio enthusiasts across the country heard her, and the broadcast was reportedly heard from as far away as New York. People listening on the radio barely heard a few scratches of the trill and two arias she sang. Further radio broadcasts would include her Covent Garden farewell performance, and a 1927 &quot;Empire Broadcast&quot; (broadcast throughout the British Empire, by radio stations AWA and 2FC, Sydney, on Monday 5 September 1927; it was relayed by the BBC London on Sunday 4 September).

==Honours, memorials and legacy==

Melba was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours, along with May Whitty the first stage performer to receive this order, for her charity work during World War I, and was elevated to Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1927. She was the first Australian to appear on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in April 1927. A stained-glass window commemorating Melba was erected in 1962 in the Musicians&#x27; Memorial Chapel of the church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, London. She is one of only two singers – the other being Adelina Patti – with a marble bust on the grand staircase of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.

A blue plaque commemorates Melba at Coombe House, Devey Close in Coombe, Kingston upon Thames, where she lived in 1906. She was inducted onto the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. Melba was closely associated with the Melbourne Conservatorium, and this institution was renamed the Melba Memorial Conservatorium of Music in her honour in 1956. The music hall at the University of Melbourne is known as Melba Hall. The Canberra suburb of Melba is named after her.

The Australian $100 note features the image of her face, and her likeness has also appeared on an Australian stamp. Sydney Town Hall has a marble relief bearing the inscription &quot;Remember Melba&quot;, unveiled during a World War II charity concert in memory of Melba and her First World War charity work and patriotic concerts. A tunnel on Melbourne&#x27;s EastLink freeway is named in her honour. Streets named after her include Melba Avenue in San Francisco and Avenue Nellie Melba / Nellie Melbalaan in the Brussels municipality of Anderlecht.

Melba&#x27;s home in Marian, Queensland, during her brief cohabitation with her husband was relocated from the Marian Mill (where it was due to be demolished) to a riverbank setting along the main Eungella Road in Edward Lloyd Park, where, under the name Melba House, it was restored and now operates as a Melba museum and the Pioneer Valley Visitor Information Centre. Her home Coombe Cottage in Coldstream, Victoria, passed to her granddaughter Pamela, Lady Vestey (1918–2011). It is now owned by Lady Vestey&#x27;s sons, Sam (3rd Baron Vestey) and Mark, who reside in the United Kingdom. The house was designed by John Harry Grainger, father of the composer Percy Grainger, and a close friend of Melba&#x27;s father David Mitchell.

Melba&#x27;s name is associated with four foods, all of which were created in her honour by the French chef Auguste Escoffier:
* Peach Melba, a dessert made of peaches, raspberry sauce, and vanilla ice cream
* Melba sauce, a sweet purée of raspberries and red currant
* Melba toast, a crisp dry toast
* Melba Garniture, chicken, truffles and mushrooms stuffed into tomatoes with velouté sauce.

Melba planted a variety of poplar tree known as &quot;Populus × canadensis &quot;Aurea&quot;&quot;, or golden poplar, on the Central Lawn in Melbourne Botanic Gardens on 11 April 1903, which has become known as &quot;Melba&#x27;s poplar&quot;. On 19 May 2011, Google celebrated her 150th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Books, films and television==
Melba&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Melodies and Memories&quot;, was published in 1925, largely ghost-written by her secretary Beverley Nichols. Nichols later complained that Melba did not cooperate in the process of writing or by reviewing what he wrote. Full-length biographies devoted to her include those by Agnes G. Murphy (1909), John Hetherington (1967), Thérèse Radic (1986) and Ann Blainey (2009).

A novel &quot;Evensong&quot; by Nichols (1932) was based on aspects of Melba&#x27;s life, drawing an unflattering portrait. The 1934 motion picture adaptation of &quot;Evensong&quot;, starring Evelyn Laye as the character based on Melba, was for a time banned in Australia. Melba appears in the 1946 novel &quot;Lucinda Brayford&quot; by Martin Boyd. She is depicted as singing at a garden party thrown by the mother of the eponymous heroine, when she is described as having the &quot;loveliest voice in the world&quot;.

In 1946–1947 Crawford Productions produced a radio series on Melba starring Glenda Raymond, who became one of the foundation singers of the Australian Opera (later Opera Australia) in 1956. In 1953 a biopic titled &quot;Melba&quot; was released by Horizon Pictures and directed by Lewis Milestone. Melba was played by the soprano Patrice Munsel. In 1987 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a mini-series, &quot;Melba&quot;, starring Linda Cropper miming to the singing voice of Yvonne Kenny. Melba was portrayed by Kiri Te Kanawa in episode 3 of season 4 of the British ITV television show &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2013), performing at the abbey as a guest of Lord and Lady Grantham. Rupert Christiansen, writing in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, bemoaned the casting and the fact checking.

Melba appears in a pivotal scene in the 2014 novel &quot;Tell&quot; by Frances Itani.

<text>In chemistry, the alkoxy group is an alkyl group which is singularly bonded to oxygen; thus . Denoted usually with apostrophe(&#x27;). The range of alkoxy groups is vast, the simplest being methoxy (). An ethoxy group () is found in the organic compound ethyl phenyl ether (, also known as ethoxybenzene). 

Related to alkoxy groups are aryloxy groups, which have an aryl group singularly bonded to oxygen such as the phenoxy group ().

An alkoxy or aryloxy group bonded to an alkyl or aryl () is an ether. If bonded to H it is an alcohol.

The term &quot;alkoxide&quot; refers to the anionic conjugate bases of alcohols () or to ionic compounds containing such an anion. Alkoxide compounds are derivatives of alcohols where the hydrogen of the –OH group is replaced by a metal; for example, the sodium salt of ethanol () is sodium ethoxide, containing ethoxide anions and sodium cations .

<doc id="254637" wikidata="Q823373" url="?curid=254637" title="Hustler (magazine)">
<text>Hustler is an American pornographic magazine published monthly by Larry Flynt Publications (LFP). Introduced in 1974, it was a step forward from the &quot;Hustler Newsletter&quot;, originally conceived by founder Larry Flynt as cheap advertising for his strip club businesses at the time. The magazine grew from an uncertain start to a peak circulation of around 3 million in the early 1980s; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. &quot;Hustler&quot; was among the first major US-based magazines to feature graphic photos of female genitalia and simulated sex acts, in contrast with relatively modest publications such as &quot;Playboy&quot;. In the 1990s, &quot;Hustler&quot;, like several of its competitors, began featuring depictions of sexual penetration and oral sex.

Today, &quot;Hustler&quot; is still considered more explicit (and more self-consciously lowbrow) than such well-known competitors as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;. &quot;Hustler&quot; frequently depicts hardcore themes, such as the use of sex toys, penetration, oral sex and group sex.

Larry Flynt Publications also licenses the Hustler brand to the Hustler Casino in Gardena, California, which was owned directly by Flynt as an individual through his holding company El Dorado Enterprises. Other enterprises include licensing the Hustler name to the Hustler Club chain of bars and clubs and the Hustler Hollywood store chain that sells adult-oriented videos, clothing, magazines and sex toys. The chain&#x27;s flagship store, formerly located on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, was torn down in 2016. Both licensed enterprises are operated by LFP&#x27;s partner, Deja Vu.

==Founding==
The business first began in Cincinnati, where Larry Flynt and his brother, Jimmy Flynt, opened up a store in 1969. Jimmy wrote the check for $5,000 to pay for the club in Cincinnati, and he was listed on the masthead for volume 1, number 1 of the magazine in July 1974. However, Larry fired his brother in 2009, after which Jimmy began developing his own business, Jimmy Flynt&#x27;s Sexy Gifts Stand. An old member of &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine has described the relationship, saying, &quot;Larry is the show, and Jimmy makes it go&quot;.

==Publisher==

&quot;Hustler&quot; is officially published by LFP, Inc, which also produces pornographic films. The abbreviation &quot;L.F.P.&quot; originally stood for &quot;Larry Flynt Publications.&quot;

A Canadian version of &quot;Hustler&quot; is published by a Quebec-based firm. This magazine is not owned by Larry Flynt but is licensed to publish material from the American version. In general, Canadian &quot;Hustler&quot; imitates the appearance and tone of its American counterpart, with Canadian content added. In 1999, the magazine created a minor controversy in Canada by inviting readers to submit sexually explicit stories about Sheila Copps, a left-leaning member of the Liberal cabinet. There have also been Australian, British and South African versions of the magazine.

During a bookstore signing in July 2011, Flynt stated that less than five percent of his income comes from the print magazine; he also speculated that the print magazine would not be around in two to three years.

==Regular features==
One feature of &quot;Hustler&quot; is the &quot;Asshole of the Month&quot; column. In every monthly issue of the magazine, a public figure is selected for severe criticism as that month&#x27;s &quot;asshole&quot;. An illustration depicting the criticized person&#x27;s head emerging from the anus of a cartoon donkey is shown alongside the article. After Flynt&#x27;s imprisonment in 1977 and his alleged conversion to evangelical Christianity, he promised to reform &quot;Asshole of the Month&quot;. However, as of 2024, reform in the feature has yet to be seen.

The centerfold pictorial is the &quot;Hustler Honey&quot;. Occasionally the models are pornographic actresses appearing under a pseudonym; in the mid-80&#x27;s, actresses and strippers appeared under their more familiar names.

&quot;Hustler&quot; ran the comic strip feature &quot;Honey Hooker&quot; from 1975 on. With each installment, Honey would have graphic sexual encounters with any male (or female) she ran across. She might be in American colonial times one month and in a Super Bowl locker room the next. This feature was designed to compete against Little Annie Fanny in &quot;Playboy&quot; and Wicked Wanda in &quot;Penthouse&quot;. Unlike Fanny and Wanda, Honey Hooker was explicitly portrayed as being a prostitute, keeping with the seamier and less romantic aspects of sexuality in &quot;Hustler&quot;. 

The &quot;Beaver Hunt&quot; section of the magazine contains explicit nudes of amateur models submitted by readers.

Another &quot;Hustler&quot; feature that was heavily criticized was the &quot;Chester the Molester&quot; comic strip. Each month&#x27;s issue depicted Chester, a cartoon middle-aged pedophile, joyfully raping or molesting young girls. After increasing criticism, the cartoon became &quot;Chester and Hester&quot;, Hester as an unattractive middle-aged woman who was Chester&#x27;s partner. Following Flynt&#x27;s alleged religious conversion, he introduced &quot;Chester the Protector&quot;, a reincarnation of Chester who served to protect young girls from rape and seduction.

The regular feature &quot;Ads We&#x27;d Like to See&quot; recreates advertisements of everyday products in a sexualized or violent way. For example, an advertisement in the 1980 issue called &#x27;Doer&#x27;s Lite Label&#x27;, a parody of Dewar&#x27;s Lite Label Whiskey, featured Kenneth Bianchi, the Hillside Strangler. Listed as his greatest accomplishment was Cindy Lee Hudspeth, whom he actually raped and murdered in 1978. He is quoted as saying &quot;You gotta treat &#x27;em rough…&quot;. This section was highly criticized for admiring men who had committed sexualized crimes against women.

In addition to its regular features, &quot;Hustler&quot; occasionally published special features and issues. Examples include the &quot;All Meat&quot; issue from 1978, in which the cover spread depicted a naked woman being fed into a meat grinder upside down. In 1977, the magazine&#x27;s front page read &quot;First-Time Ever Scratch &#x27;N&#x27; Sniff Centerfold&quot;.

== Controversy and criticism ==
In 1984, conservative academic Judith Reisman received a grant from the Department of Justice to complete a study at American University concerning the cartoons of &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;Hustler&quot;, specifically the sexual depictions of minors in these cartoons. She finished the study in 1986 and found that, on average, the number of times per issue that &quot;Hustler&quot; referred to children, crime, and violence was 46.

Reisman published a nearly 1,600-page report of her findings condemning the sexual depictions of children in pornographic magazines, but her work was met with criticism from her peers. An American University professor, Myra Sadker, said that she was &quot;very dismayed about the quality of office management and the nature of the research that was going on.&quot; Many fellow academics have disputed the neutrality of the research. Avedon Carol, a sex crime researcher and author, said that Reisman&#x27;s study was a &quot;scientific disaster, riddled with researcher bias.&quot;

&quot;Hustler&quot;&#x27;s chief cartoon artist Dwaine Tinsley was arrested on May 18, 1989, after being accused by his 18-year-old daughter Allison of molesting her since she was thirteen years old. According to court records, he allegedly told his coworkers, &quot;You can&#x27;t write about this stuff all the time if you don&#x27;t experience it.&quot; Tinsley was found guilty of five counts of child molestation and sentenced to six years in prison although he only spent 23 months behind bars. Tinsley was the artist behind the magazine&#x27;s regular &quot;Chester the Molester&quot; series, which was printed in the magazine from 1976 to 1989.

In a 2012 issue of &quot;Hustler&quot;, S. E. Cupp, a conservative commentator, was photoshopped and depicted as explicitly performing oral sex. The article describes Cupp as a &quot;lovely young lady who read too much Ayn Rand in high school and ended up joining the dark side... But her hotness is diminished when she espouses dumb ideas like defunding Planned Parenthood.&quot; Despite having a disclaimer that the photo was not real, the photograph horrified Cupp, knowing that &quot;this photo will be out there forever.&quot; Flynt&#x27;s response was that the photoshopped image was meant to be satirical: &quot;I&#x27;m able to publish this because of the Supreme Court case I won in 1984, &quot;Flynt V. Falwell&quot;.&quot; Cupp did not pursue either Flynt or the magazine because of &quot;free speech&quot;. Cupp ultimately chose to &quot;express a little gratitude for &quot;Hustler&quot;,&quot; saying: &quot;I&#x27;m completely serious here—there is an accompanying sidebar to this story, in which they lay out why they did this to me. It&#x27;s under a hundred words, and in that paragraph they say, &#x27;S.E. Cupp, she&#x27;s lovely, she&#x27;s smart, she&#x27;s fine, but she happens to be a crazy conservative who is pro-life and wants to defund Planned Parenthood. And for that, she deserves a phallus in her mouth.&#x27; That is essentially what they&#x27;re saying, and I have to commend that as being incredibly honest.&quot;

== Lawsuits and litigation ==
The magazine has had many lawsuits since the 1980s, including claims of defamation and enforcement of sexual violence and behavior. However, there have not been any lawsuits against the magazine or incorporation as of 2016.

In &quot;Douglass v. Hustler Magazine Inc.&quot; 769 F.2d 1128 (1985), actress Robyn Douglass sued &quot;Hustler&quot; for defamation and unlawfully placing her under a false light. Douglass posed nude for freelance photographer Augustin Gregory, believing that her photos would appear in an issue of &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot;. However, Gregory was hired to &quot;Hustler&quot; and Douglass&#x27;s photos were published in the 1981 January issue without Douglass&#x27;s consent. She brought the case to the United States District Court from the North District of Illinois on the basis that the magazine had defamed her name and likeness. The court cases ended in favoring Douglass since the magazine had violated her right of publicity, awarding her $600,000.

In &quot;Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.&quot;, 465 U.S. 770 (1984) United States supreme court case, Kathy Keeton, vice chairman of &quot;Penthouse&quot;, sued &quot;Hustler&quot; for defamation. Keeton brought the case to New Hampshire due its generous six-year statute of limitations for libel and the state believed it was able to support taking jurisdiction due to the magazine&#x27;s content. The magazine sold up to 15,000 issues since 1975, containing a cartoon where Keeton had received a venereal disease from Robert Guccione, a publisher of &quot;Penthouse&quot;. Keeton was awarded $2 million for the defamation damages.

At some point between 1974 and 1983, &quot;Hustler&quot; began mailing the latest issue of the magazine, uninvited and for free, to all of the offices of Members of the United States Congress. Attempts to block the monthly mailings proved unsuccessful after a court ruled in &quot;Hustler&quot;&#x27;s favor in &quot;United States Postal Service v. Hustler Magazine, Inc.&quot; (1986), contending that the publishers had the right to mail the magazine, as the defendants did not &quot;threaten the unique privacy interests that attach in the home.&quot; The practice continues as of April 2014.

&quot;Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell&quot;, 485 U.S. 46 (1988), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public figures from recovering damages for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), if the emotional distress was caused by a caricature, parody, or satire of the public figure that a reasonable person would not have interpreted as factual.

In &quot;Herceg v. Hustler&quot; 484 U.S. 811 (1989), a family attempted to sue &quot;Hustler&quot; for the suicide of their fourteen-year-old boy on the basis that its illustrations stimulated violence. Within the magazine&#x27;s contents was the article &quot;Orgasm of Death&quot;, demonstrating practices of erotic asphyxia via photographs in order to heighten sexual pleasure in men. However, &quot;Hustler&quot; placed disclaimers on the photographs of &quot;Do Not Attempt&quot; to prevent the audience from mimicking the photos. The court case ended in favoring the magazine; the court agreed that the depictions were not forcing readers to perform these erotic or dangerous activities.

==Erotic Movie Awards==
During the Golden Age of Porn, and prior to getting into the movie business themselves, &quot;Hustler&quot; was one of two magazines that announced awards for adult sex films, the other being &quot;Adam Film World&quot;. They were discontinued in the late 1980s.

The awards were based on fan ballots printed in the publication. In announcing its third annual awards, the magazine said, &quot;&quot;Hustler&quot;&#x27;s erotic-movie awards are intended to reward excellence in the erotic-film industry and thereby encourage the fast-buck makers of mediocrity to clean up their act or go out of business.&quot;

<doc id="254638" wikidata="Q1370258" url="?curid=254638" title="Missus dominicus">
<text>A missus dominicus (plural missi dominici), Latin for &quot;envoy[s] of the lord [ruler]&quot; or palace inspector, also known in Dutch as Zendgraaf (German: &quot;Sendgraf&quot;), meaning &quot;sent Graf&quot;, was an official commissioned by the Frankish king or Holy Roman Emperor to supervise the administration, mainly of justice, in parts of his dominions too remote for frequent personal visits. As such, the &quot;missus&quot; performed important intermediary functions between royal and local administrations. There are superficial points of comparison with the original Roman &quot;corrector&quot;, except that the &quot;missus&quot; was sent out on a regular basis. Four points made the &quot;missi&quot; effective as instruments of the centralized monarchy: the personal character of the &quot;missus&quot;, yearly change, isolation from local interests and the free choice of the king.

==Reign of Charlemagne==

Based on Merovingian &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangements, using the form &quot;missus regis&quot; (the &quot;king&#x27;s envoy&quot;) and sending a layman and an ecclesiastic in pairs, the use of &quot;missi dominici&quot; was fully exploited by Charlemagne (ruling 768—814), who made them a regular part of his administration, &quot;a highly intelligent and plausible innovation in Carolingian government&quot;, Norman F. Cantor observes, &quot;and a tribute to the administrative skill of the ecclesiastics, such as Alcuin and Einhard&quot;. The &quot;missi&quot; were at first chosen from Charlemagne&#x27;s personal, most trusted entourage, of whatever social degree. Soon they were selected only from the secular and ecclesiastical nobility: the entry for 802 in the so-called Lorsch Annals (794–803) states that instead of relying on &quot;poorer vassals&quot;, Charlemagne &quot;chose from the kingdom archbishops and bishops and abbots, with dukes and counts, who now had no need to receive gifts from the innocent, and sent them throughout his kingdom, so that they might administer justice to the churches, to widows, orphans and the poor, and to all the people.&quot; Presumably the same year the capitulary usually known as the &quot;Capitulare missorum generale&quot; was issued, which gives a detailed account of their duties and responsibilities. They were to execute justice, to ensure respect for the king, to control the government of the military dukes and administrative counts (then still royal officials), to receive their oath of allegiance, to let the king&#x27;s will be known, at times by distributing capitularies around the empire, and to supervise the clergy of their assigned region. In short, they were the direct representatives of the king or Holy Roman Emperor. The inhabitants of the district they administered had to provide for their subsistence, and at times they led the host to battle. The &quot;missi&quot; were protected by a triple &quot;wergeld&quot; and resistance to them was punishable by death. In addition special instructions were given to various &quot;missi&quot;, and many of these have been preserved.

As &quot;missi&quot; became a conventional part of court machinery, &quot;missus ad hoc&quot; came to signify &quot;missi&quot; sent out for some particular purpose. The districts placed under the ordinary &quot;missi&quot;, which it was their duty to visit for a month at a time, four times a year, were called &quot;missatici&quot; or &quot;legationes&quot; (a term illustrating the analogy with a papal legate); the &quot;missatica&quot; (singular &quot;missaticum&quot;) avoided division along the lines of the existing dioceses or provinces. The &quot;missi&quot; were not permanent officials, but were generally selected from the ranks of officials at the court, and during the reign of Charlemagne high-standing personages undertook this work. They were sent out collegially, usually in twos, an ecclesiastic and a layman, and were generally complete strangers to the district which they administered, to deter them from putting out local roots and acting on their own initiative, as the counts were doing. In addition extraordinary &quot;missi&quot; represented the emperor on special occasions, and at times beyond the limits of his dominions. Even under the strong rule of Charlemagne it was difficult to find men to discharge these duties impartially, and after his death in 814 it became almost impossible.

==Reigns of Louis the Pious and Charles the Bald==
Under Charlemagne&#x27;s surviving legitimate son, Louis the Pious (ruling 813–840),the process of disintegration was hastened. Once the king associated the choice of &quot;missi&quot; with the assembly of nobles, the nobles interfered in the appointment of the &quot;missi&quot;. The &quot;missi&quot; were later selected from the district in which their duties lay, which led to their association with local hereditary filiations and in general a focus upon their own interests rather than that of the king. The 825 list of &quot;missi&quot; reveals that the circuits of the &quot;missatica&quot; now corresponded with provinces, strengthening local powers. The duties of &quot;missi&quot;, who gradually increased in number, became merged in the ordinary work of the bishops and counts, and under the emperor Charles the Bald (ruling 843–877), who was repeatedly pressured by bishops to send out &quot;missi&quot;, they took control of associations for the preservation of the peace. Louis the German (ruling 843–876) is not known to have sent out &quot;missi&quot;. About the end of the ninth century, with the implosion of Carolingian power, the &quot;missi&quot; disappeared from France and during the 10th century from Italy.

The &quot;missi&quot; were the last attempt to preserve centralised control in the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of the ninth century, the forces which were making for feudalism tended to produce inherited fiefdoms as the only way to ensure stability, especially in the face of renewed external aggression in the form of Viking attacks, to which the impaired central power was demonstrated to be impotent.

<text>The University of Salford is a public research university in Salford, Greater Manchester, England, west of Manchester city centre. The Royal Technical Institute, Salford, which opened in 1896, became a College of Advanced Technology in 1956 and gained university status in 1967, following the Robbins Report into higher education.

It has students () and is in of parkland on the banks of the River Irwell.

==History==

===Origins of the Royal Technical Institute===
The university&#x27;s origins can be traced to the opening in 1896 of the Royal Technical Institute, Salford, a merger of Salford Working Men&#x27;s College (founded in 1858) and Pendleton Mechanics&#x27; Institute (founded in 1850). The Royal Technical Institute received royal letters after the then-Duke and Duchess of York (later King George V and Queen Mary) officiated at its opening ceremony, an event commemorated in the university&#x27;s Redbrick Peel Building and which allowed &#x27;Royal&#x27; to be appended to the name of the institute.

At the start of the 20th century, mechanical engineering, chemical works, textiles and construction dominated the industrial scene in Salford. This heavily influenced the choice of subjects offered in the nine departments initially opened. These were Engineering, Electrical Engineering &amp; Applied Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Building, Dyeing, Spinning &amp; Weaving, Domestic, and Art. Some 1,240 students registered for the first session in these departments. There were originally 19 members of staff.

In 1921 the institute was renamed the Royal Technical College, Salford. In 1958 the institution split into two organisations: the remaining Royal Technical College and a breakaway institution, Peel Park Technical College. This changed its name first in 1961 to Salford Technical College, before becoming the Salford College of Technology in 1970, and finally University College Salford in 1992.

===Royal College of Advanced Technology===
The Royal Technical College became a CAT in 1956, and became known as the Royal College of Advanced Technology. In 1963, the government completed an inquiry into the state of higher education in the United Kingdom and produced the Robbins Report, which paved the way for the Royal College of Advanced Technology (and other Colleges of Advanced Technology) to assume university status by Royal Charter.

===University status===
The Royal College of Advanced Technology became the University of Salford on 10 February 1967, when Queen Elizabeth II handed over the institution&#x27;s Royal Charter. A multistorey chemistry tower was built in the 1960s between the Peel Building and the Salford Library, Museum and Art Gallery, but it was pulled down in the 1980s due to the damage it was causing to the foundations of these nearby buildings. The first Vice-Chancellor was Clifford Whitworth, after whom the university&#x27;s main library is named. The first Chancellor was Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who remained the university&#x27;s chancellor until 1991. Prince Philip took a keen interest in the university and he visited the university&#x27;s award-winning acoustics laboratories in 2008. The breakaway University College Salford merged with the University of Salford in 1996, to form a single institution.

In 2012, the University of Salford announced a partnership with the UK&#x27;s biggest arms company, (BAE Systems), and four other universities in northwestern England (Liverpool, Manchester, UCLAN and Lancaster) in order to work on the Gamma Programme, which aims to develop &quot;autonomous systems&quot;. On 5 September 2016, Salford was represented for the third time on &quot;University Challenge&quot; and faced the Open University. The all male team, who sported the poet John Cooper Clarke as a mascot lost 210 to 115 points.

==Campus and facilities==


The main Peel Park campus is less than from Manchester city centre on the banks of the River Irwell, adjacent to Peel Park, possibly the first public park in the world, which opened on 22 August 1846. A former president of the Students&#x27; Union described Salford in 2007 as &quot;a relaxed campus close to Manchester, but cheaper and greener.&quot; Salford Crescent railway station is adjacent to the campus, and high frequency bus services operate to Manchester, Salford and Bolton and Liverpool. There are other university facilities within a mile of the main campus, namely the Frederick Road and Adelphi campuses. Most of the university administration buildings are along Salford Crescent, opposite the Peel Campus. The Salford Museum and Art Gallery, said to be the first unconditionally free public library in England, is located on the Peel Park Campus.

===MediaCityUK===
In October 2010 the university opened a learning, teaching and research space at MediaCityUK. They will study in 39 undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.

===Major investment projects===

The university embarked on a £150 million programme of investment in 2004, to deliver new buildings and carry out major refurbishment projects. These included:
*£22m Mary Seacole Building, opened in 2006, the purpose-built five-storey facility for the College of Health and Social Care.
*£10m Lady Hale Building for the Salford Law School which opened in February 2008. The whole building acts as its own night storage heating and cooling system thanks to a &quot;Termodeck&quot; system.
*£10m Innovation Forum Building
*Joule Physics Laboratory provides a suite of new, purpose-built physics teaching laboratories and is named after James Prescott Joule, whose former home is situated opposite the Peel Building.
*Opened in October 2011 - A new building for the university&#x27;s College of Arts, Media &amp; Social Sciences designed by 3XN Architects on the MediaCityUK site in Salford Quays - which will be home to five BBC departments.

In summer 2013 construction work started on the £55 million New Adelphi building. The building opened in September 2016 and houses music, performance, art, design and architecture students. Facilities include a 350 capacity theatre with flexible seating to suit a range of events, 140sqm studio theatre, 2 large TV acting studios, 36 dedicated rehearsal rooms, 6 industry-standard recording studios, 12 amplified performance spaces (music ensemble rooms), 2 dance studios, 3 floors of dedicated wood, metal, textiles, print and plastics workshops, 7 photographic studios, 14 instrumental tuition rooms, a double-height 100 sq m band-room/live room and a suite of flexible performance and studio spaces. It also features a small gallery space.

An extension to the existing Newton Building, which houses the School of Computing, Science and Engineering, was awarded planning permission in May 2016. The £16 million project, known as the Engineering Showcase, was due to feature exhibition space to display engineering solutions, research/demonstration spaces, open-plan collaborative learning spaces, informal and formal presentation spaces, a café and &#x27;maker-space&#x27;. Plans for the extension were put on hold in favour of a wider campus redesign, with the possibility of a brand new building to house teaching and laboratory facilities for a range of disciplines in Science, Engineering and Environment. An autonomous vehicle research centre was built in place of the proposed extension.

In July 2020 work started on a £65 million new engineering building to replace the aging Newton building, as of the time of writing, the new building is still being completed with work to move the equipment to the new building being carried out over the summer of 2022 with an anticipated opening date in September/October 2022.

===Library===
The Library was opened in 1971 by Prince Philip, the then chancellor of the university. It was renamed the Clifford Whitworth Library in 1984 following the death of the university&#x27;s first vice-chancellor, Clifford Whitworth. A two-storey extension was added to the left of the building in the 1990s and was further extended in the 2000s into the top floor of Lady Hale Building via a link bridge. Between 2016 and 2018 the Clifford Whitworth Library went under a major £6.2 million refurbishment.

===Facilities===

Peel Hall has seating for nearly 400 people, hosts many musical performances and is the main venue for the midday recitals. The hall is housed in the Peel Building, a red brick and terracotta Victorian building on the Peel Park Campus.

The university&#x27;s Robert Powell Theatre, named after the Salford-born actor, mostly stages live performances of modern works and participatory work for younger audiences.

At the heart of the Peel Park Campus, the Chapman Gallery hosts a wide range of modern and contemporary art exhibitions that showcase the work of up and coming artists, university staff, students and the community of Salford.

The Tom Husband Leisure Centre is on the Peel Park Campus and adjacent to the Students&#x27; Union. It contains a gym, 25m swimming pool, sauna and spa, squash courts, climbing wall, and a multi-use sports hall.

The Adelphi Studio Theatre is a small theatre venue based in the School of Music, Media and Performance&#x27;s Adelphi Building.

The KidsCan Children&#x27;s Cancer Research Centre is in the university&#x27;s John Armstrong Welsh Laboratories at the Centre for Biochemistry, Drug Design and Cancer Research. It was established in 2002 to develop treatments with fewer side effects for children and young adults.

==Academic profile==
The university was organised into seven schools:
*School of Arts and Media
*Salford Business School
*School of Health Sciences
*School of Health and Society
**NB — The university&#x27;s Schools of Health Sciences and Nursing, Midwifery, Social Work and Social Sciences have strong links with teaching NHS hospitals in the north-west of England and maintain a presence at the Salford Royal Hospital.
*School of Computing, Science and Engineering
*School of Environment and Life Sciences
*School of the Built Environment

After a series of mergers, in 2018 and 2019, the university is now organised into four schools:

*School of Arts, Media and Creative Technology
*School of Science, Engineering and Environment
*School of Health and Society
*Salford Business School

International students come from China, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, Greece, Nigeria, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Malaysia and Bulgaria. Previously, with its three colleges, 12 schools, nearly 20,000 students, and over 2,500 staff, Salford had a turnover of some £156m in 2006/07. A report from social and economic impact report published in 2019, sets the turnover to £180.5m in 2019,

The university is a founding member of the Northern Consortium of universities.

In October 2008 it was announced that compulsory redundancies were likely at the university, as part of a plan to save £12.5 million over three years. A notice by the university registrar said that Salford needed to invest £300 million in university estate and £40 million in moving the arts and media faculty to the &quot;MediaCityUK&quot; site at Salford Quays, where the BBC is to establish its northern headquarters. The notice went on to say that these additional costs came in the context of a number of pressures: salary bills that had &quot;exceeded the university&#x27;s expectations&quot;; a &quot;serious problem&quot; with student retention; the &quot;credit crunch&quot;; and three &quot;seriously underperforming&quot; schools. Affected schools include the School of Nursing, Salford Business School and the School of Community Health Sciences and Social Care.

===Teaching quality and rankings===

In the 2018 &quot;Guardian&quot; University League Tables, the University of Salford placed 99th, down from 83rd in 2017. &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper ranked Salford 105th out of 123 UK institutions in 2015, from 84th of 114 in 2010.

==Student life==
University House on the Peel Park Campus is home to the University of Salford Students&#x27; Union (USSU). As well as representing students, the union plays host to a number of services, including shops and a bar.

The Two Cities Boat Race is an annual boat race that has been running since 1972. It is now an established event in the sporting and social calendar of Salford and Manchester. The event is also significant for the amount of work put in by volunteers from both universities, to help with event set-up, stewarding, and programme selling, raising money for many different charities. In 2007 the recipient of the proceeds was SPARKS, a charity that supports medical research for children.

In 1971–72, the University Rugby League club won the UAU Championship, beating Sheffield University in the final at The Willows, then home of Salford Rugby League Club.

===Accommodation===
There are five self-catered halls of residence:

*Peel Park Quarter
*Eddie Colman and John Lester Courts
*Bramall Court
*iQ Salford, Seaford Road
*Sanctuary Students - Tramways, Seaford Road

Peel Park Quarter encompasses nine buildings of flats owned by Campus Living Villages, comprising a total of 1,367 rooms. There are six variations of rooms, including wheelchair accessible en-suite rooms. This complex opened for students in summer 2015.

Eddie Colman and John Lester Courts are two blocks of flats containing 755 rooms in total, and each flat is shared between two, three or four people. The flats are the closest accommodation to Salford Shopping City in Pendleton – colloquially referred to as the Precinct. Eddie Colman and John Lester Courts were sold by the University of Salford to Campus Living Villages in December 2008. These became CLV&#x27;s first British properties. Eddie Colman was a resident of nearby Archie Street, the model for the television series &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and was a player for Manchester United. He was killed in the Munich Disaster of 6 February 1958 along with seven other players.

Constantine Court was the only &quot;en suite&quot; university-owned accommodation, which consisted of 80 rooms in seven houses. This accommodation was in the centre of the main university campus, close to the Students&#x27; Union shop, a bank and Salford Crescent railway station. Adjacent Horlock Court comprised 168 rooms in 14 houses.

Bramall Court contains flats close to the Adelphi Campus. The flats are shared between two, three or four. Bramall Court is now owned by Campus Living Villages.

Castle Irwell Student Village was the largest area of accommodation, housing up to 1,600 students, and is on the site of the old Manchester Racecourse. Castle Irwell was a popular choice for first years, due to the cheap rent, however Castle Irwell is no longer in use and has been superseded by the on-campus Peel Park Quarter. In 2016 the main building on the Castle Irwell site, known as &#x27;the pav&#x27;, was burned down in an arson attack. Shortly after, demolition of the burnt and other derelict buildings on site commenced and completely cleared by early 2017.

iQ Salford, Seaford Road is owned and run by iQ Student Accommodation. This accommodation site consists of a square of houses around a central reception, lounge, and laundry building, with an independent gym. Each house contains six flats, which are typically shared by six people with en suite bathrooms. The site also has deluxe rooms available for an extra cost. This accommodation is very close to Castle Irwell. The site includes purpose-built SPAR, Subway and Greggs shops.

Tramways, Seaford Road is independently run by Sanctuary Students. Its name originates from the old tram depot, run by Manchester Corporation Tramways, that was located on the same site.

=== Sports ===
The university currently has 35 sports clubs ranging from football to ultimate (originally known as ultimate Frisbee). Each year, Salford and Chester University take part in a varsity challenge. This began in 2016 at Chester&#x27;s campus. In 2016, 19 sports were involved and Chester won 12–7 overall. The following year took place at Salford, and with an overall score of 12–8, Salford took the trophy.

==Student body==
At Salford there is still a difference in the degrees obtained by White students and those obtained by BAME students. The reported gap for 2017/2018 for first and 2.1 class degree level is 15% between white and BAME students as published in a university report. The students&#x27; union believe that the Black attainment gap is a result of institutional and systemic failures within the institution, including a lack of diversity within teaching, inadequate support services and covert racism and microagressions towards BME students. The university intend to respond by creating an &#x27;inclusive environment&#x27;. To date this has involved surveying students and signing up to the Race Equality Charter. This is crucial, as The university has 10% more BAME students than the national average at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. As of 9 August 2018, BAME staff representation (13%) does not match the BAME student population representation. Whilst there have been a 2% increase in BAME lecturers being hired, there is an 8% decrease in promotion to senior lecturer level and a 3% increase at Professorial level. The university report states that &#x27;...it is important that we consider the pipeline for BAME academics to address this decrease.&#x27;. In October 2019, the university hosted a two-week festival on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, with the theme, &#x27;belonging at Salford&#x27;. As part of this, a one-day symposium featured keynote speaker, Nicola Rollock, a leading figures with a vision for equality, diversity and inclusion. There were presentations on the BAME Attainment Gap, a panel discussion of BAME women in HE, and networking opportunities for academics and students.

Representation of female staff is 51% compared to 56% undergraduate students. The number of staff who are LGBT is 4% and is equivalent to the number of students who report as being LGBT, however it is worth noting that 49% of students didn&#x27;t report their sexuality. There is an underrepresentation of disabled staff (4%) compared to undergraduate students (21%).

<text>Karelian (; ; ; ) is a Finnic language spoken mainly in the Russian Republic of Karelia. Linguistically, Karelian is closely related to the Finnish dialects spoken in eastern Finland, and some Finnish linguists have even classified Karelian as a dialect of Finnish, but nowadays it is widely considered a separate language. Karelian is not to be confused with the Southeastern dialects of Finnish, sometimes referred to as (&quot;Karelian dialects&quot;) in Finland. In the Russian 2020–2021 census, around 9,000 people spoke Karelian natively, but around 14,000 said they were able to speak the language. There are around 11,000 speakers of Karelian in Finland. And around 30,000 people in Finland have at least some knowledge of Karelian.

The Karelian language is a group of two supradialects. The two supradialects are Karelian Proper (which comprises Northern Karelian and South Karelian (including the Tver enclave dialects)) and Olonets Karelian (Livvi Karelian). The Ludic language is sometimes considered one more dialect of Karelian, sometimes a separate language. There is no single standard Karelian language, so each writer writes in Karelian according to their own dialectal form. All variants are written with the Latin-based Karelian alphabet, though the Cyrillic script has been used in the past.

Based upon toponymic and historical evidence, a form of Karelian was also spoken among the extinct Bjarmians in the 15th century.

==Classification==
Karelian is a Finnic language from the Uralic language family, and is closely related to Finnish. Finnish and Karelian have common ancestry in the Proto-Karelian language spoken in the coast of Lake Ladoga in the Iron Age, and Karelian forms a dialect continuum with the Eastern dialects of Finnish. Earlier, some Finnish linguists classified Karelian as a dialect of Finnish, sometimes known in older Finnish literature as (&#x27;Border Karelian dialects&#x27;), but today Karelian is seen as a distinct language. Besides Karelian and Finnish, the Finnic subgroup also includes Estonian and some minority languages spoken around the Baltic Sea.

== Usage ==
Karelian is a language in danger of extinction, with 45% of speakers being over 65 years old and with around 1% of speakers being under 15 years of age. The language is also not understood or spoken at all by a majority of the people in the Republic of Karelia, with around 43% of people using the language.

==Geographic distribution==

In Russia, Karelian is spoken by about 13,880 people (2020), mainly in the Republic of Karelia, although notable Karelian-speaking communities can also be found in the Tver region (Tver Oblast) northwest of Moscow. Previously, it was estimated that there were 5,000 speakers in Finland, mainly belonging to the older generations, but more recent estimates have put the number of people with even slight knowledge of the language at 30,000. Due to post-World War II mobility and internal migration, Karelians now live scattered throughout Finland, and Karelian is no longer spoken as a local community language.

===Official status===
In the Republic of Karelia, Karelian has official status as a minority language, and since the late 1990s there have been moves to pass special language legislation, which would give Karelian an official status on par with Russian. Karelians in Tver Oblast have a national-cultural autonomy which guarantees the use of the Karelian language in schools and mass media. In Finland, Karelian has official status as a non-regional national minority language within the framework of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

===Supradialects and dialects===
The Karelian language has two main varieties, which can be considered as supradialects or separate languages: Karelian Proper, which comprises Northern Karelian and South Karelian (including the Tver enclave dialects); and Olonets Karelian. These varieties constitute a continuum of dialects, the ends of which are no longer mutually intelligible. Varieties can be further divided into individual dialects:
* Karelian
** Karelian Proper
*** North Karelian (spoken in the parishes of Jyskyjärvi, Kieretti, Kiestinki, Kontokki, Oulanka, Paanajärvi, Pistojärvi, Suomussalmi, Uhtua, Usmana, Vitsataipale and Vuokkiniemi)
*** South Karelian (spoken in the parishes of Ilomantsi, Impilahti, Korpiselkä, Mäntyselkä, Paatene, Porajärvi, Repola, Rukajärvi, Suikujärvi, Suistamo, Suojärvi and Tunkua; and additionally in the enclaves of Tver, Tikhvin and Valdai)
**** Tver Karelian
***** Dorža dialect
***** Maksuatiha dialect
***** Ruameška dialect
***** Tolmattšu dialect
***** Vesjegonsk (Vessi) dialect
** Olonets Karelian or Livvi (spoken in the parishes of Kotkatjärvi, Munjärvi, Nekkula-Riipuškala, Salmi, Säämäjärvi, Tulemajärvi, Vieljärvi and Vitele)

The Ludic language, spoken along the easternmost edge of Karelian Republic, is in the Russian research tradition counted as a third main dialect of Karelian, though Ludic shows strong relationship also to Veps, and it is today also considered a separate language.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====
Like Finnish, the Karelian language has 8 phonemic vowel qualities, totalling 11 vowel phonemes when vowel length is considered:

Only the close vowels , and may occur long. The original Proto-Finnic long mid and open vowels have been diphthongized: &gt; (as also in Finnish); *aa, *ää &gt; (as also in Savonian dialects of Finnish).

====Diphthongs====
North Karelian and Olonets Karelian have 21 diphthongs:

====Triphthongs====
In addition to the diphthongs North Karelian has a variety of triphthongs:
Olonets Karelian has only the triphthongs .

===Consonants===
There are 20 non-palatalized consonants in Karelian with their own single grapheme, and 2 are represented with multigraphs:


Some palatalized consonants exist: /lʲ nʲ sʲ tʲ/ in Karelian Proper (North), /dʲ lʲ nʲ rʲ sʲ tʲ/ (/zʲ/ also exists, but only in loanwords) in Olonets Karelian, /dʲ lʲ nʲ rʲ sʲ tʲ zʲ/ in Ludic and Tver Karelian. Palatalized labials are also present in some loanwords: North Karelian &quot;b&#x27;urokratti&quot; &#x27;bureaucrat&#x27;, Livvi &quot;b&#x27;urokruattu&quot; &#x27;bureaucrat&#x27;, &quot;kip&#x27;atku&quot; &#x27;boiling water&#x27;, &quot;sv&#x27;oklu&quot; &#x27;beet&#x27;, Tver Karelian &quot;kip&#x27;atka&quot; &#x27;boiling water&#x27;, &quot;s&#x27;v&#x27;okla&quot; &#x27;beet&#x27; (from Russian бюрократ, кипяток, свёкла).

Voiced velar nasal // (eng) is present before /g/, /k/ and /kk/, and the combination is represented with multigraphs , or . Karelian Proper does not geminate /ŋ/ in consonant gradation unlike Finnish: &quot;kengät&quot; &#x27;shoes&#x27; pronounces as instead of Finnish .

Olonets, Ludic, and Tver Karelian have the voiced affricate //, represented in writing by the digraph .

==Writing system==

===Alphabet===
Karelian is today written using a Latin alphabet consisting of 29 characters. It extends the ISO basic Latin alphabet with the additional letters Č, Š, Ž, Ä, Ö and &#x27; and excludes the letters Q, W and X. This unified alphabet is used to write all Karelian varieties including Tver Karelian. The very few texts that were published in Karelian from medieval times through the 19th century used the Cyrillic alphabet. With the establishment of the Soviet Union, Finnish, written with the Latin alphabet, became official. However, from 1938 to 1940 Karelian written in Cyrillic replaced Finnish as an official language of the Karelian ASSR (see &quot;History&quot; below).

Example from Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Cyrillic Karelian script, transliteration and translation:

Cyrillic:

&quot;Каи рахвас роиттахeс вäллиннÿ да тазаарвозинну омас арвос да оигeвуксис. Ёгахизeлe хeис он аннeтту миeли да оматундо да хeил вäлтäмäттäх пидäÿ олла кeскeнäх, куи вeллил&quot;.

Latin:

Kai rahvas roittahes vällinny da taza-arvozinnu omas arvos da oigevuksis. Jogahizele heis on annettu mieli da omatundo da heil vältämättäh pidäy olla keskenäh, kui vellil.

Translation:

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

===Orthography===
Karelian is written with orthography similar to Finnish orthography. However, some features of the Karelian language and thus orthography are different from Finnish:
* The Karelian system of sibilants is extensive; in Finnish, there is only one: .
* Phonemic voicing occurs.
* Karelian retains palatalization, usually denoted with an apostrophe (e.g. )
* The letter &#x27;ü&#x27; may replace &#x27;y&#x27; in some texts.
* The letter &#x27;c&#x27; denotes , although &#x27;ts&#x27; is used also. &#x27;c&#x27; is more likely in Russian loan words.
/c/ and /č/ have length levels, which is not found in standard Finnish. For example, in Kalevala, Lönnrot&#x27;s orthography hides the fact that the pronunciation of the original material is actually , with palatalization of the affricate. The exact details depend on the dialect, though. See &quot;Yleiskielen ts:n murrevastineet&quot;.

Karelian actually uses as a voiced alveolar fricative. (In Finnish, &quot;z&quot; is a foreign spelling for .) The plosives , and may be voiced. (In most Finnish dialects, they are not differentiated from the unvoiced , , and . Furthermore, in Karelian except North Karelian, voiced consonants occur also in native words, not just in loans as in standard Finnish.)

The sounds represented by &quot;č, š&quot; and &quot;ž&quot; are native to Karelian, but not Finnish. Speakers of Finnish do not distinguish and from , nor from (medial) or (initial). For example, the native Karelian words and are and in standard Finnish.

==History==

===Prehistory===
As all other Finnic languages, Karelian descends from Proto-Finnic, which in turn ultimately descends from Proto-Uralic. The most recent ancestor of the Karelian dialects is the language variety spoken in the 9th century at the western shores of Lake Ladoga, known as Old Karelian (Finnish: ).

Karelian is usually considered a part of the Eastern Finnic subgroup. It has been proposed that Late Proto-Finnic evolved into three dialects: Northern dialect, spoken in western Finland; Southern dialect, spoken in the area of modern-day Estonia and northern Latvia, and Eastern dialect, spoken in the regions east of the Southern dialect. In the 6th century, Eastern dialect arrived at the western shores of Lake Ladoga, and in the 9th century, Northern dialect reached the same region. These two dialects blended together and formed Old Karelian.

===Medieval period===
By the end of the 13th century, speakers of Old Karelian had reached the Savo region in eastern Finland, increasingly mixing with population from western Finland. In 1323, Karelia was divided between Sweden and Novgorod according to the Treaty of Nöteborg, which started to slowly separate descendants of the Proto-Karelian language from each other. In the areas occupied by Sweden, Old Karelian started to develop into dialects of Finnish: Savonian dialects and Southeastern dialects.

Birch bark letter no. 292 from the early 13th century is the first known document in any Finnic language. It was found in 1957 by a Soviet expedition, led by Artemiy Artsikhovskiy in the Nerev excavation on the left coast side of Novgorod. The language used in the document is thought to be an archaic form of the language spoken in Olonets Karelia, a dialect of the Karelian language. A later manuscript, no. 403 (second half of the 14th century), apparently belonging to a tax collector, includes a short glossary of Karelian words and their translations.

In the regions ruled by Novgorod, the protolanguage started to evolve into Karelian language. In 1617 Novgorod lost parts of Karelia to Sweden in the Treaty of Stolbovo, which led the Karelian-speaking population of the occupied areas to flee from their homes. This gave rise to the Karelian speaking population in the Tver and Valday regions.

===19th century===
In the 19th century, a few books were published in Karelian using the Cyrillic script, notably &quot;A Translation of some Prayers and a Shortened Catechism&quot; into North Karelian and Olonets (Aunus) dialects in 1804, and the gospel of St. Matthew in South Karelian Tver dialect, in 1820. Karelian literature in 19th century Russia remained limited to a few primers, songbooks and leaflets.

===Soviet period===
In 1921, the first all-Karelian congress under the Soviet regime debated whether Finnish or Karelian should be the official language (next to Russian) of the new &quot;Karelian Labour Commune&quot; (, in Cyrillic Karelian), which two years later would become the Karelian ASSR. Finnish communists as well as ethnic Finns from North America, who came to live in Soviet Karelia, dominated the political discourse, as they were in general far better educated than local Karelians. They favored the use of Finnish, which had just been through an 80-year period of standardization based on a variety of dialects across Finland — and the Finns saw Karelian simply as additional Finnish dialects. In the end Finnish was established as the official &quot;local&quot; language.

An intense program of Finnicization, but called &quot;Karelianization&quot;, began and Finnish-language schools were established across Soviet Karelia. Newspapers, literary journals were established and Russian literature was translated into Finnish, while much literature from Soviet Karelia in Finnish was published.

While this was happening in Soviet Karelia, in 1931–33, a Karelian literary language using the Latin alphabet was standardized for the Tver Karelian community of about 127,000 people, hundreds of kilometers to the south.

Between 1935 and 1938 the Finnish-dominated leadership of Soviet Karelia including leader Edvard Gylling, was removed from power, killed or sent to concentration camps. The Finnish language was branded a language of the bourgeois Finnish society in Finland proper, and was later regarded as a &quot;fascist&quot; language of the Finnish enemy.

From early 1938 to April 1940, the Soviet authorities ceased publication in Finnish, all Finnish-language schools were closed and the children were prohibited from speaking Finnish even during recess. The Soviet government replaced Finnish in the Karelian ASSR with Karelian written in the Cyrillic alphabet.

A new form of standardized Karelian was hurriedly introduced in 1938, written in Cyrillic, with only nine grammatical cases, and with a very large and increasing number of words taken directly from Russian but with Karelian grammatical endings. During this period about 200 titles were published, including educational materials, children&#x27;s books, readers, Party and public affairs documents, the literary journal &quot;Karelia&quot;. The newspaper &quot;Karjalan Sanomat&quot; was written in this new Karelian Cyrillic, rather than in Finnish. Karelians who did not speak Russian could not understand this new official language due to the amount of Russian words, for example, the phrase &quot;Which party led the revolution&quot; in this form of Karelian was given as () where the word for party, led, and revolution are all Russian words with Karelian grammatical endings, whereas the Finnish equivalent words have completely different roots: 

After the Winter War, in April 1940, political considerations changed again. The USSR established the Karelo-Finnish SSR with the idea that Finland proper would eventually be annexed to the USSR as part of that Republic. Finnish, written in the Latin alphabet, was once again made the official &quot;local&quot; language of Soviet Karelia, alongside Russian.
In the 1980s, publishing began again in various adaptations of the Latin alphabet for Olonets Karelian and the White Sea and Tver dialects of Karelian Proper.

===Recent events===
Since the 1990s the Union of Karelian people started to organize various projects to popularize the Karelian language in Karelia and Finland.

In 2007 a standard alphabet was adopted to write all dialects (Tver Karelian adopted it in 2017).

In 2008, Joensuu University launched Finland&#x27;s first Karelian language professorship, in order to save the language. A year later, Finland&#x27;s first Karelian language nest (pre-school immersion group) was established in the town of Nurmes.

Croatian singer Jurica Popović collaborated with Tilna Tolvaneen on lyrics for his 1999 song &quot;H.O.T. Hold On To Your Tradition&quot;, which are partly in Karelian.

==Examples of Karelian supradialects==

=== North Karelian (White Sea Karelian) ===
A sample from the book :

:(Translation: Old people used to say that the swan is born of man. Swans are always paired up. When one is shot, the other weeps for it for a long time. Yet the swan is a sacred bird. Nobody ever dared to shoot them, for that was a sin. Swans come to us in the spring and in the autumn they leave again for the south. They fly in large flocks. When they left, it was a sign that winter was near.)

=== Olonets Karelian ===

==== Sample 1 ====
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

:(English version: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.)

==== Sample 2 ====
A sample from the book . Note the older alphabet:

=== Tver Karelian ===

A sample from the book :

:(Translation: Puasinkoi is a small Karelian village in the Tver region. There are forty houses. The village lies by a river. The river flows slowly—that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called Tihvinitša. The surrounding region is very beautiful.—(My) father told (me): once, many hundreds of years ago, Karelians from North-Karelia came there. They cut down the forest and founded this village. And even now, there are houses in the village, which have been built from the trees of the old forest.)

<doc id="254645" wikidata="Q561705" url="?curid=254645" title="Quintus Fufius Calenus">
<text>Quintus Fufius Calenus (died 40 BC) was a Roman Republican politician and general. When Fufius was plebeian tribune in 61 BC he was an ally of Publius Clodius Pulcher during the Bona Dea affair. During his praetorship in 59 BC he supported Julius Caesar who was then consul. Fufius later served under Caesar at the close of the Gallic Wars and during the civil war that followed. For his services he was made consul in 47 BC. After Caesar&#x27;s death in 44 BC, he supported Mark Antony against Cicero during the ensuing conflict in the senate. As an ally of Antony governing Cisalpine Gaul, he died of illness in 40 BC on the cusp of intervening in the Perusine War.

== Tribunate and praetorship ==
Friedrich Münzer, writing in the &quot;Realencyclopädie&quot;, argued that the fact that he had an adult son in 47 BC indicates that he entered Roman political life during the years of Cinna&#x27;s &quot;dominatio&quot; and that his career stalled during and after Sulla&#x27;s civil war. Hailing from a family that had some place in Roman politics – Cicero paints his father as having had some influence – Fufius was a homo novus from a gens that had never before held the consulship.

He was plebeian tribune in 61 BC and secured the amendment of a senatorial bill constituting a tribunal to try Publius Clodius Pulcher for profaning the rites of the Bona Dea: the initial bill had a jury appointed by the urban praetor. After a series of political disputes with Quintus Hortensius, Calenus secured a revote in the senate on a divided motion: one to approve the creation of a special tribunal and a second to secure the appointment of jurors by regular order. With the first passing and the second failing, he then brought the enabling legislation that led to Clodius&#x27; trial on more favourable terms.

In 59 BC, Calenus was praetor and supported Caesar during the latter&#x27;s consulship that same year. According to Cassius Dio, he passed legislation to ensure that the three jury panels of the &quot;quaestiones perpetuae&quot; (senators, equestrians, and &quot;tribuni aerarii&quot;) reported their votes separately. However, T R S Broughton also notes that juror votes were already reported separately during the trial of Catiline in 65 BC, meaning that Fufius&#x27; law may have had little impact.

After his praetorship, little is known of his activities. He was present in Rome in 3–4 April 56 BC, however, as a witness at the trial of Marcus Caelius Rufus. He is also documented at Rome in 52 BC, where in the aftermath of the murder of Clodius by Titus Annius Milo, he moved division of Hortensius&#x27; original motion to try Milo in the regular courts under expedited procedure into two parts: expedited procedure and use of the regular courts. This allowed the second part, relating to the regular courts, to be vetoed by two tribunes, Sallust and Titus Plancus Bursa. This paved the way for Milo to be tried in a special tribunal under the &quot;lex Pompeia de vi&quot;. Asconius notes in his commentaries how Fufius, in both 61 and 52, outmanoeuvred Hortensius with parliamentary procedure.

== Service under Caesar and the triumvirs ==
The next year, Fufius served under Caesar as a legate in the Gallic Wars, taking part in clean-up operations against Uxellodunum. At the outbreak of Caesar&#x27;s civil war, he joined Caesar and fought in the campaign against the Pompeians in Spain and Massilia. Tasked with bringing reinforcements to Greece with Mark Antony, Fufius was repulsed first by Bibulus&#x27; fleet and delayed by enemy occupation of landing sites. Commanding a detachment of troops, Fufius secured the surrender of Delphi, Thebes, and Piraeus without resistance; Athens and Megara were besieged but quickly surrendered after news of Pompey&#x27;s defeat at Pharsalus arrived. When Caesar followed Pompey to Egypt and became embroiled in the Alexandrian war, Fufius remained in Greece to secure the territory and send reinforcements to Egypt.

For these services, Fufius was awarded the consulship in 47 BC on the dictator&#x27;s return to Italy. Elections for that year had been irregularly postponed until September and the electoral &quot;comitia&quot; belatedly returned Fufius and Publius Vatinius as &quot;consules ordinarii&quot;. After Caesar&#x27;s assassination in 44 BC and the ensuing military crisis between the senate and Antony, Fufius urged envoys be sent to Antony, earning Cicero&#x27;s ire in the Fifth Philippic. Dio places an invective speech against Cicero in Fufius&#x27; mouth, which according to Münzer may reflect historical positions. Regardless, the senatorial envoys to Antony were unsuccessful and after the death of both consuls at battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, Antony was able to consolidate his position among the Caesarian commanders in Gaul and northern Italy. During the proscriptions that followed the senate&#x27;s defeat in the war, the &quot;lex Titia&quot;, and the creation of the Second Triumvirate, Fufius interceded to save the life of Marcus Terentius Varro.

Opinions differ as to Calenus&#x27; political position in the aftermath of Caesar&#x27;s death. Per Anna Miączewska, most of the ancient sources paint him as a &quot;sensible and agreeable politician who supported peace&quot; during the Mutina crisis. Most scholars believe Fufius was and early supporter of and instrumental in consolidating support behind Antony in the aftermath of the assassination. It is not clear, however, to what extent that Fufius&#x27; attempts to keep the peace by supporting negotiation rather than aggressive action against Antony, as Cicero desired, were part of a conspiracy with Antony.

During the ensuing war against the tyrannicides, Antony placed Fufius in command of two legions to defend Italy. In 41 BC he assumed a governorship of Transalpine Gaul and Hispania Citerior at the head of 11 legions. During the Perusine War, he wanted to intervene with his forces in favour of Lucius Antonius (Mark Antony&#x27;s brother) against Octavian, but before he could set out he died of illness in 40 BC. His homonymous son handed over the legions to Octavian.

== Family ==
Fufius had two children, a daughter called Fufia who was the wife of Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus (consul in 43 BC) and a homonymous son. It is possible that the Lucius Calenus noted in Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Verrines&quot; was the brother of this Fufius, or otherwise this Fufius&#x27; son.

<text>Veps, also known as Vepsian (Veps: , or ), is a Finnic language from the Uralic language family, that is spoken by Vepsians. The language is written in the Latin script, and is closely related to Finnish and Karelian.

According to Soviet statistics, 12,500 people were self-designated ethnic Veps at the end of 1989. There were 5,900 self-designated ethnic Veps in 2010, and around 3,600 native speakers.

According to the location of the people, the language is divided into three main dialects: Northern Veps (at Lake Onega to the south of Petrozavodsk, to the north of the river Svir, including the former Veps National Volost), Central Veps (in the east of the Leningrad Oblast and northwest of the Vologda Oblast), and Southern Veps (in the Leningrad Oblast). The Northern dialect seems the most distinct of the three; however, it is still mutually intelligible for speakers of the other two dialects. Speakers of the Northern dialect call themselves &quot;Ludi&quot; (), or .

In Russia, more than 350 children learn the Veps language in a total of five national schools.

==Classification and history==

Veps is the easternmost surviving member of the Finnic languages. Having developed in relative isolation, the language lacks several features found in its relatives, such as consonant gradation and the length contrast in consonants. Original vowel length has mostly been lost as well (with the exception of Northern Veps, which retains &quot;ii&quot; and &quot;uu&quot;). At the same time, it retains a number of archaic features.

The closest relative of Veps is Ludic, connecting Veps to the wider Finnic dialect continuum.

Veps also shows some characteristic innovations such as the vocalization of original syllable-final*l, and the expansion of the local case system.

Birch bark letter no. 292 is the first known document in any Finnic language; it is considered to be closest to modern Karelian or Veps. The document was discovered near Novgorod in Russia and is dated to the early 13th century.

==Distribution==

According to Ethnologue there were 3,160 speakers of Veps in 2010, located in the Republic of Karelia and in the Leningrad and Vologda Oblasts.

==Dialects==
Veps shows substantial dialectal variation, affecting both phonetics and grammatical features. Three main dialect areas can be distinguished, the northern, central and southern dialects.

===Northern===
Northern Veps is spoken in the Republic of Karelia along the coast of Lake Onega south of Petrozavodsk. It is also spoken in a few small villages in Leningrad Oblast. Villages speaking Northern Veps include Shyoltozero, , and , as well as the city of Petrozavodsk itself.

Characteristics of Northern Veps are:
* Diphthongs are either preserved in their historical form (), or the first component is raised ( &gt; ).
* Combinations of vowel + &quot;l&quot; are usually preserved ( , , , , , , , rarely vocalized to diphthongs: &quot;al&quot; &gt; &quot;au&quot;, &quot;el&quot;, &quot;il&quot;, &quot;ül&quot; , &quot;öl&quot; &gt; &quot;üu&quot; and &quot;ol&quot; &gt; &quot;uu&quot; .
* &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;r&quot; are always palatalized before &quot;e&quot; in a non-initial syllable.
* Word-final consonants are not palatalized after &quot;i&quot;, in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.
* Long close vowels are retained, with &quot;*üü&quot; often diphthongized to &quot;üu&quot; ( &gt; , contrast Southern and Central Veps ).
* &quot;j&quot; is fortified to &quot;dʹ&quot; word-initially, and medially after consonants ( &gt; , &gt; , &gt; , &gt; ).
* The last consonant of the stem is lengthened in the third-person singular present indicative ( &gt; &gt; ), and stem-final &quot;e&quot; becomes &quot;o&quot; ( &gt; ).
* Only traces of vowel harmony are retained.

===Central===
Central Veps dialects are rather distinct from each other compared to Northern and Southern Veps, which are relatively homogeneous. They are spoken around a long line stretching from Tervenichey in the Lodeinopolsky District of Leningrad Oblast to near Lake Beloye. The largest locality speaking Central Veps dialects is Vinnitsy.

Characteristics of Central Veps are:
* Diphthongs are usually modified ( &gt; &gt; ).
* Combinations of vowel + &quot;l&quot; are vocalized to diphthongs in Kuya and Pondala (Belozersk), and usually preserved elsewhere ().
* &quot;al&quot; and &quot;el&quot; are vocalized to &quot;ou&quot; or &quot;uu&quot; (&quot;el&quot; may also become &quot;üu&quot;) in the adessive and ablative case forms ( &gt; &gt; ).
* Word-final consonants are palatalized after &quot;i&quot; ( &gt; &gt; ).
* In Kuya village, the vowel in the allative ending depends on the preceding stem vowel. After &quot;i&quot; the ending is (), after &quot;a&quot; it is () and after other vowels it is ().
* &quot;j&quot; is preserved in most dialects, mostly in the west (). &quot;j&quot; is fortified to &quot;dʹ&quot; in Kuya (). It is fortified to &quot;gʹ&quot; in Pondala, Voylahta, Nemzha, and Shimozero ().
* Final obstruent devoicing in Kuya Veps ( &gt; &gt; ).
* Unrounding of &quot;ü&quot; and &quot;ö&quot; in a few villages ( &gt; &gt; ).
* &quot;ä&quot; &gt; &quot;e&quot; in Shimozero ( &gt; ).
* Vowel harmony is weakly preserved, most prominently in the eastern and south-western areas.

===Southern===
Southern Veps is spoken in the Boksitogorsky District of Leningrad Oblast, including the villages of Radogoshcha and .

Characteristics of Southern Veps are:
* Diphthongs are monophthongized to long vowels, especially in non-initial syllables ( &gt; &gt; ).
* Combinations of vowel + &quot;l&quot; are usually preserved.
* &quot;al&quot; and &quot;el&quot; are vocalized to &quot;aa&quot; and &quot;oo&quot; in the adessive and ablative case forms ( &gt; &gt; ).
* &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are palatalized before &quot;e&quot; in non-initial syllables when followed by a case ending or person-and-number ending. &quot;r&quot; is not palatalized.
* Word-final consonants are palatalized after &quot;i&quot;, in for example the past indicative, the conditional and some case forms.
* &quot;j&quot; is preserved (, ).
* Unrounding of front rounded vowels, &quot;ü&quot; &gt; &quot;i&quot; ( &gt; ) and &quot;ö&quot; &gt; &quot;e&quot;.
* The ending of the third-person singular past indicative is usually dropped, leaving palatalization of the preceding consonant ( &gt; &gt; &gt; ).
* Vowel harmony is preserved well ().

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
====Palatalization====
In general, palatalizable consonants are palatalized allophonically before a front vowel. However, palatalized consonants also occur in other environments, especially in word-final position or in word-final clusters.

There are some cases where the front vowel is preceded by a non-palatalized consonant. In native Finnic vocabulary, this occurs where inflectional endings beginning with are attached to words with a stem ending in a non-palatalized consonant. The consonant is not palatalized by in this case, but remains non-palatalized by analogy with the other inflected forms. The vowel is backed to in this case, as in Russian, making it unclear whether the palatalization is a consequence of the front vowel, or the backing is the result of the lack of palatalization. Either analysis is possible.

Compare:
* (&quot;young&quot;), genitive singular , partitive plural 
* (&quot;rope&quot;), genitive singular , partitive plural (or )

Russian loanwords have also introduced instances of non-palatalized consonants followed by , which are much more frequent in that language.

The phoneme can also in some cases be preceded by non-palatalized consonants, for example in the allative ending .

===Vowels===
The status of is marginal; it occurs as an allophone of after a non-palatalized consonant. See above under &quot;Palatalization&quot; for more information. It does not occur in the first syllable of a word.

====Vowel harmony====

Like many other Finnic languages, Veps has vowel harmony but in a much more limited form. Words are split into back-vowel and front-vowel words based on which vowels they contain:

* Back vowels: , and 
* Front vowels: , and 

However, the front vowels can only occur in the first two syllables of a word. In a third or later syllable, and also sometimes in the second syllable, they are converted to the corresponding back vowel. Thus, vowel harmony only applies (inconsistently) in the second syllable, and has been lost elsewhere. It is not applied for inflectional endings except in a few exceptional cases, but is retained more frequently in derivational endings.

For example:
* (&quot;high&quot;, back-vowel harmony), genitive singular , derived noun (&quot;height&quot;); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;dark&quot;, back-vowel harmony), genitive singular , derived noun (&quot;darkness&quot;); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;good&quot;, front-vowel harmony), illative singular , derived noun (&quot;goodness&quot;); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;day&quot;, front-vowel harmony), genitive singular , illative singular ; compare Finnish .
* (&quot;head&quot;, back-vowel harmony), illative singular ; compare Finnish .
* (&quot;summer&quot;, back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;son-in-law&quot;, back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;to rise&quot;, front-vowel harmony in second syllable, back-vowel in third); compare Finnish .
* (&quot;to ask&quot;, back-vowel harmony); compare Finnish .

==Orthography==
The modern Vepsian alphabet is a Latin alphabet. It consists of a total of twenty-nine characters: twenty-two are from the basic modern Latin alphabet, six are derived from basic Latin letters by the addition of diacritical marks, and the final character is the apostrophe, which signifies palatalization of the preceding sound.

Veps orthography is largely phonemic, and represents each phoneme with one letter. Palatalized consonants are single phonemes, and thus the combination of a letter and a following apostrophe is a single combined letter for this purpose. The following table shows the correspondences between letters and phonemes:

Palatalization of consonants before front vowels is not indicated in the orthography, so plain consonant letters can represent both types of consonant depending on what vowel follows. For the following letters and , this is ambiguous, however: they can be preceded by both types of consonants, as noted above in the phonology section. Whether a consonant before the letter or is palatalized or not cannot be determined from the orthography and must be learned for each word.

==Grammar==

Like other Finnic languages, Veps is an agglutinating language. The preservation of the Proto-Finnic weak-grade consonants &quot;*d&quot; and &quot;*g&quot; in all positions, along with the loss of consonant gradation, has made Veps morphology relatively simple compared to the other Finnic languages. There are fewer inflectional classes, and inflections of nominals and verbs alike can be predicted from only a few basic principal parts.

===Nouns===
Veps has twenty-three grammatical cases, more than any other Finnic language. It preserves the basic set of Finnic cases shared by most Finnic languages, including the six locative cases, but several more cases have been added that generally have no counterpart in the others.

Notes:
# &quot;V&quot; indicates a copy of whatever vowel the genitive singular stem ends with, replacing a &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot;, &quot;ü&quot; with &quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;u&quot;. For example, for the illative singular: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; . Note that the stem-final vowel itself can disappear in these forms, but the rule applies the same.
# In endings beginning with &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot; or a group of consonants containing &quot;s&quot; or &quot;z&quot;, this changes to &quot;š&quot;/&quot;ž&quot; if the last preceding vowel is &quot;i&quot;. This always occurs in the plural forms.
# The partitive, allative, terminative II, additive II and prolative singular cases have longer endings that are used with a few frequently-used pronouns, &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot;.

====Principal parts====

Nouns have four principal parts, from which all other noun forms can be derived by replacing the endings:
* Nominative singular: Forms no other forms.
* Partitive singular: Forms the prolative singular. Can usually be formed from the genitive singular by replacing &quot;-n&quot; with &quot;-d&quot;, but some words have an unpredictable form with &quot;-t&quot; and a different stem.
* Genitive singular: When &quot;-n&quot; is removed, forms all remaining singular forms, and the nominative and accusative plural. It is often unpredictable due to historical apocope.
* Illative singular: Forms the illative, terminative I and additive I singular. The illative singular is predictably formed from the genitive singular stem, so it&#x27;s not a principal part as such.
* Partitive plural: When &quot;-d&quot; is removed, forms all remaining plural forms.

The illative singular stem is the same as the genitive singular stem, except that the final vowel is dropped in some cases. The vowel is retained if &quot;at least one&quot; of these is the case, and dropped otherwise:
# The final vowel is a diphthong.
# The nominative singular is of the form &quot;consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel&quot;.
# The genitive singular has 1 or 3 syllables.
# There is contraction of a syllable in the genitive singular stem (compared to the nominative stem), e.g. nom sg &gt; gen sg (contraction &quot;-ged&quot; &gt; &quot;-kt-&quot;), nom sg &gt; gen sg (contraction &quot;-az&quot; &gt; &quot;-h-&quot;).
# The final consonants of genitive singular stem are &quot;ll&quot; or &quot;lʹlʹ&quot;.

Thus:
If the genitive singular stem has &quot;h&quot; before the final vowel, then the ending ( after &quot;i&quot;) is used, and the vowel is never dropped:

===Verbs===

====Endings====
Veps has innovated a special reflexive conjugation, which may have middle voice or passive voice semantics. The endings are as follows:

Infinitives:
* First infinitive in or (reflexive: add ).
* Second infinitive in or with inessive or instructive case endings.
* Third infinitive in with inessive, illative, elative, adessive or abessive case endings.

Participles:
* Present active participle in (stem ). This is the same suffix as is used for agent nouns.
* Past active participle in (stem ).
* Past passive participle in or .

The original Finnic present active participle is falling out of use, and is preserved only for a few verbs, as (stem ).

====Negative verb====
===Pronouns===
The personal pronouns are of Finno-Ugric origin:

<doc id="254652" wikidata="Q5142221" url="?curid=254652" title="Cold Comfort Farm">
<text>Cold Comfort Farm is a comic novel by English author Stella Gibbons, published in 1932. It parodies the romanticised, sometimes doom-laden accounts of rural life popular at the time, by writers such as Mary Webb. The novel was awarded the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize in 1933.

== Plot summary ==
Following the death of her parents, the book&#x27;s heroine, Flora Poste, finds she is possessed &quot;of every art and grace save that of earning her own living&quot;. She decides to take advantage of the fact that &quot;no limits are set, either by society or one&#x27;s own conscience, to the amount one may impose on one&#x27;s relatives&quot;, and settles on visiting her distant relatives at the isolated Cold Comfort Farm in the fictional village of Howling in Sussex. The inhabitants of the farm – Aunt Ada Doom, the Starkadders, and their extended family and workers – feel obliged to take her in to atone for an unspecified wrong once done to her father.

As is typical in a certain genre of romantic 19th-century and early 20th-century literature, each of the farm&#x27;s inhabitants has some long-festering emotional problem caused by ignorance, hatred, or fear, and the farm is badly run. Flora, being a level-headed, urban woman in the dandy tradition, determines that she must apply modern common sense to their problems and help them adapt to the 20th century – bringing metropolitan values into the sticks.

==Inspirations==
As parody of the &quot;loam and lovechild&quot; genre, &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; alludes specifically to a number of novels both in the past and contemporarily in vogue when Gibbons was writing. According to Faye Hammill&#x27;s &quot;Cold Comfort Farm, D. H. Lawrence, and English Literary Culture Between the Wars&quot;, the works of Sheila Kaye-Smith and Mary Webb are the chief influence: she considered that the farm is modelled on Dormer House in Webb&#x27;s &quot;The House in Dormer Forest&quot;, and Aunt Ada Doom on Mrs. Velindre in the same book. The farm-obsessed Reuben&#x27;s original is in Kaye-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Sussex Gorse&quot;, and the Quivering Brethren on the Colgate Brethren in Kaye-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Susan Spray&quot;. Others see John Cowper Powys&#x27;s rural mysticism as a further target, as featured in his Wessex novel &quot;Wolf Solent&quot; (1929): &quot;He felt as if he enjoyed at that hour some primitive life-feeling that was identical with what those pollarded elms felt.&quot;

The speech of the Sussex characters is a parody of rural dialects (in particular Sussex and West Country accents – another parody of novelists who use phonics to portray various accents and dialects) and is sprinkled with fake but authentic-sounding local vocabulary such as &quot;mollocking&quot; (Seth&#x27;s favourite activity, undefined but invariably resulting in the pregnancy of a local maid), &quot;sukebind&quot; (a weed whose flowering in the Spring symbolises the quickening of sexual urges in man and beast; the word is presumably formed by analogy to &#x27;woodbine&#x27; (honeysuckle) and bindweed) and &quot;clettering&quot; (an impractical method used by Adam for washing dishes, which involves scraping them with a dry twig or &quot;clettering stick&quot;).
Her portrayal of libidinous Meyerburg, &quot;Mr Mybug&quot;, may have been aimed at Hampstead intellectuals (particularly Freudians and admirers of D. H. Lawrence), but has also been seen as antisemitic in its description of his physiognomy and nameplay.

==Responses and influence==

Sheila Kaye-Smith, often said to be one of the rural writers parodied by Gibbons in &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, arguably gets her own back with a tongue-in-cheek reference to &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; within a subplot of &quot;A Valiant Woman&quot; (1939), set in a rapidly modernising village. The upper-middle-class teenager Lucia turns from writing charming rural poems to a great Urban Proletarian Novel: &quot;… all about people who aren&#x27;t married going to bed in a Manchester slum and talking about the Means Test.&quot; Her philistine grandmother is dismayed: she prefers &quot;cosy&quot; rural novels, and knows Lucia is ignorant of proletarian life:

Elizabeth Janeway responded to the lush ruralism of Laurie Lee&#x27;s memoir &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; by suggesting an astringent counterblast might be found by &quot;looking for an old copy of Stella Gibbons&#x27;s &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot;&quot;.

== Characters ==
In order of appearance:

In London:
*Flora Poste: the heroine, a nineteen-year-old from London whose parents have recently died
*Mary Smiling: a widow, Flora&#x27;s friend in London
*Charles Fairford: Flora&#x27;s cousin in London, studying to become a parson

In Howling village Sussex:
*Judith Starkadder: Flora&#x27;s cousin, wife of Amos, with an unhealthy preoccupation for her own son Seth
*Seth Starkadder: younger son of Amos and Judith, handsome and over-sexed, with a passion for the movies
*Ada Doom: Judith&#x27;s mother, a reclusive, miserly widow, owner of the farm, who constantly complains of having seen &quot;something nasty in the woodshed&quot; when she was a girl
*Adam Lambsbreath: 90-year-old farm hand, obsessed with his cows and with Elfine
*Mark Dolour: farm hand, father of Nancy
*Amos Starkadder: Judith&#x27;s husband and hellfire preacher at the Church of the Quivering Brethren (&quot;Ye&#x27;re all damned!&quot;)
*Amos&#x27;s half-cousins: Mica, married to Susan; Urk, who expects to marry Elfine and is devoted to water-voles; Ezra, married to Jane; Caraway, married to Lettie; Harkaway
*Amos&#x27;s half-brothers: Luke, married to Prue; Mark, divorced from Susan and married to Phoebe
*Reuben Starkadder: Amos&#x27;s heir, jealous of anyone who might stand between him and his inheritance of the farm
*Meriam Beetle: hired girl and mother of Seth&#x27;s four children
*Mrs Beetle: Meriam&#x27;s mother, cleaning lady, rather more sensible than the Starkadders
*Elfine: an intellectual, nature-loving girl of the Starkadder family, who is besotted with the local squire Richard Hawk-Monitor of Hautcouture (pronounced &quot;Howchiker&quot;) Hall
*Mrs Murther: landlady of The Condemn&#x27;d Man public house
*Mr Meyerburg (whom Flora thinks of as &quot;Mr Mybug&quot;): a writer who pursues Flora and insists that she only refuses him because she is sexually repressed; he is working on a thesis that the works of the Brontë sisters were written by their brother Branwell Brontë
*Claud Hart-Harris: urbane friend of Flora&#x27;s whom she summons to accompany her, Seth and Elfine to a ball at Hautcouture Hall
*Mrs Hawk-Monitor: initially far from being pleased at her son&#x27;s choice of bride
*Rennett: unwanted daughter of Susan and Mark
*Dr Müdel: psychoanalyst
*Mr Neck: film producer

Animals at Cold Comfort Farm:
*Graceless, Aimless, Feckless, and Pointless: the farm&#x27;s cows and Adam Lambsbreath&#x27;s chief charge
*Viper: the horse, who pulls the trap which is the farm&#x27;s main transportation
*Big Business: the bull, who spends most of his time inside the barn

==Futurism==
Although the book was published in 1932, the setting is an unspecified near future, shortly after the &quot;Anglo-Nicaraguan wars of 1946&quot;. It refers to future social and demographic changes, such as the changing neighbourhoods of London: Mayfair has become a slum and Lambeth is fashionable.

The book contains technological developments that Gibbons thought might have been invented by then, such as TV phones and air-taxis, so the novel has been compared to science fiction.

== Prequel and Sequel ==
* &quot;Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (actually a collection of short stories, of which &quot;Christmas&quot; was the first) was published in 1940. It is a prequel of sorts, set before Flora&#x27;s arrival at the farm, and is a parody of a typical family Christmas.

* &quot;Conference at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, a sequel, was published in 1949 to mixed reviews.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; has been adapted several times, including twice by BBC television.

* In 1968 a television serial was made, dramatised by David Turner in three 45 minute episodes. It starred Alastair Sim as Amos, Fay Compton as Aunt Ada, Sarah Badel as Flora Poste, Rosalie Crutchley as Judith, Brian Blessed as Reuben and Peter Egan as Seth. Joan Bakewell was the narrator. This BBC adaptation was released on VHS but as of April 2014 is no longer available commercially.

* In 1981, the BBC produced a four-part radio adaptation by Elizabeth Proud, who also narrated. Patricia Gallimore played Flora, and Miriam Margolyes played Mrs. Beetle. In January 1983, a 2-part sequel, &quot;There Have Always Been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, set several years later and based on &quot;Conference at Cold Comfort Farm&quot;, when Flora is married with several children, was broadcast, with Patricia Gallimore again playing Flora.

* In 1995, a television film was produced that was generally well received by critics. Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that this screen version &quot;gets it exactly right&quot;. The film starred Kate Beckinsale as Flora, Joanna Lumley as her friend and mentor Mary Smiling, Rufus Sewell as Seth, Ian McKellen as Amos Starkadder, Eileen Atkins as Judith, Stephen Fry as Mybug, and Angela Thorne as Mrs Hawk-Monitor. Freddie Jones, who had played both Urk and Dr Mudel in the 1968 version, appeared as Adam Lambsbreath, while Miriam Margolyes again played Mrs. Beetle. The 1995 version was produced by BBC Films and Thames International, and was directed by John Schlesinger, from a script by novelist Malcolm Bradbury. It was filmed on location at Brightling, East Sussex. In 1996 and 1997, this version also had a brief theatrical run in North America, Australia and some European countries. Schlesinger reportedly used his own money to enlarge the 16mm BBC version of the film to 35mm, which was turned down by several US distributors before being distributed by Gramercy Pictures. As of April 2014, the film is still available on DVD in both the US and UK.

== Other uses of title ==

The book inspired Mellon family heiress Cordelia Scaife May to name her home &quot;Cold Comfort&quot;, and to name her philanthropic foundation Colcom Foundation.

==Critical reception==

&quot;BBC News&quot; included &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

<doc id="254654" wikidata="Q762130" url="?curid=254654" title="The Chaos Engine">
<text>The Chaos Engine is a top-down run and gun video game developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade Software in March 1993. The game is set in a steampunk Victorian age in which one or two players must battle the hostile creations of the eponymous Chaos Engine across four landscapes and ultimately defeat it and its deranged inventor.

It was first released for the Amiga, with a version available for AGA Amigas, and later ported to MS-DOS, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari ST, Amiga CD32, RISC OS and Mega Drive. In the Super NES and Mega Drive versions, the Preacher character was renamed as the Scientist and redesigned to remove his clerical collar. The US versions of these two ports were retitled Soldiers of Fortune. A sequel to the game, &quot;The Chaos Engine 2&quot;, was released in 1996.

==Plot==
The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. A time traveller on a reconnaissance mission from the distant future became stranded in the England of the late 1800s, and his technology came into the hands of the Royal Society, led by Baron Fortesque (based upon Charles Babbage), a grand inventor. Fortesque then retro engineered many of the futuristic contraptions, creating an entirely different, alternate timeline.

Baron Fortesque then succeeded in his greatest creation yet: the Chaos Engine, which was able to experiment with matter and the very nature of space and time. Unfortunately for the rest of the proud kingdom, the Engine then proceeded to become sentient, captured and assimilated its creator, and began to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appeared everywhere, and even prehistoric beasts were resurrected. Telegram wires connecting the British Isles to the European mainland are cut, and any ship attempting to enter a British port is attacked. The British Royal Family, members of Parliament and a large number of refugees manage to escape across the sea, bringing with them many tales of horror. The British Empire is left in tatters, and the world in economic and political chaos. That lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially-rewarding quest to infiltrate the quarantined Britain, find the root of the problem, and swiftly bring a full stop to it.

At the end of the cellars in the hall of machines, the player characters face the Chaos Engine itself in a last battle. Upon its destruction, the narrator of the game is revealed to be the baron himself, trapped within the machine and studded with implants.

The introductory sequence is displayed in text on the screen on the floppy disk Amiga versions, but a slightly modified version is narrated with a voiceover on the Amiga CD32 version, together with some scene-setting animations.

==Characters==
Players choose two adventurers from a group of six to take on the task of defeating the mad Baron Fortesque and the Chaos Engine itself. The playable characters have various qualities that affect gameplay, such as speed and combat ability. The players are provided with a certain amount of money to start the game and must hire the chosen characters at their set prices.

In one-player mode, the computer artificial intelligence controls the second player, so that one never has to fight the chaos alone. Control of characters cannot be swapped once chosen. It is possible to play with only one character, by starting a two-player game and letting the enemies kill the second character.

===Navvie and Thug===
The Navvie and Thug are the strongest and most expensive of the group. They have the highest health and most destructive specials but are slower than the other characters. The Navvie uses a bazooka, which fires straight ahead and does heavy damage; the Thug uses a shotgun, which is less powerful than the bazooka but fires many shots in a wide angle.

===Brigand and Mercenary===
The Brigand and Mercenary are the all-rounded characters and have a mid-range price. Though they are slightly weaker than the Navvie and Thug, they have access to more specials and can move faster. The Brigand uses a rifle, which works the same as the Navvie&#x27;s bazooka but is not as powerful. The Mercenary uses a Gatling gun that operates similarly to the Thug&#x27;s shotgun, but with a different pattern.

===Gentleman and Preacher/Scientist===
The Gentleman and Preacher are the least expensive, with the highest movement speed and widest selection of specials; however, they have the lowest health. The Gentleman uses a flame pistol, while the Preacher carries a laser. Their shots are weaker than those of the other characters, but can pass through enemies after hitting them.

For the North American release, the Preacher character was redesigned slightly and renamed as the Scientist because the game&#x27;s North American publishers felt that a priest killing people was offensive.

==Gameplay==
The players must travel through four worlds consisting of four levels each, picking up power-ups, gold and keys to pass through the various puzzles and mazes. A number of &quot;nodes&quot; must be activated via weapon fire (or special power) to open the final doors at the end of each level. At the end of every second level, the players has a chance to spend their collected riches to upgrade their weapons, increase the number of hit points of their character, purchase new items and improve other character attributes.

==Development==
Developers included Steve Cargill, Simon Knight, Dan Malone, Eric Mathews and Mike Montgomery. Joi composed the title theme and Richard Joseph composed all other in-game music.

The game was inspired by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, and its basic plot and stylistics are both based on the novel.

The game&#x27;s coder developed the partner AI by observing play-testing of the game, then coding the AI according to his observations of the player&#x27;s behaviors.

The game was later ported to consoles. In order to fit the soundtrack into the Super NES&#x27;s audio memory, which is much smaller than the Amiga&#x27;s, Joseph both used standard compression methods and put all the note data and drivers in the console&#x27;s main memory, reserving the audio memory for samples.

==Reception==

&quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Super NES version a 6.8 out of 10, summarizing it as &quot;A decent overhead shooting game in the spirit of &quot;Technoclash&quot; and &quot;Gauntlet&quot;.&quot; They gave the Genesis version a 6.4. &quot;GamePro&quot; remarked of the Genesis version that &quot;Overhead-view gunfighting has never played better&quot;, citing the heavy challenge, solid controls, and use of teamwork. They criticized the sprites as overly small, but also noted that the sharp artwork ensures that it is still easy to make out what is happening on screen.

Reviewing the computer version, &quot;Computer Game Review&quot;″s Tasos Kaiafas wrote, &quot;For the price, this a must-buy if you like two-player arcade shooters, especially since another one for the PC may not come along for awhile.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; ranked &quot;The Chaos Engine&quot; 68th on their Top 100 SNES Games summarizing: &quot;Sort of Jules Vern meets Arnie. This is a great cooperative challenge and very stylish with it.&quot;

==Remake==
A remastered version of the game of &quot;The Chaos Engine&quot;, essentially a widescreen port of the Amiga AGA version (named AA version in the title screen) with the original intro and music intact, was developed by Abstraction Games and released for Windows, Mac and Linux on August 29, 2013. The game retains all gameplay features, the audio and the graphics of the original.

The remastered version adds the option to play a remote two-player game through Steam. There is also a global high score list, and two optional graphics effects: a softening filter to alleviate the low-resolution pixelated graphics and a bloom effect on selected parts of the game graphics.

<text>Richard Joseph (23 April 1953 – 4 March 2007) was an English computer game composer, musician and sound specialist. He had a career spanning 20 years starting in the early days of gaming on the C64 and the Amiga and onto succeeding formats.

==Biography==
Prior to working in games Richard Joseph had a fleeting career in the music industry working with artists such as Trevor Horn and Hugh Padgham. He released one solo single on EMI and was part of the group CMU which released two albums (although Joseph was only involved with the second, &quot;Space Cabaret&quot;) on Transatlantic before evolving into jazz funk band Shakatak.

Joseph was noted in game audio for bringing &quot;real&quot; voice actors into a game for the first time (&quot;Mega Lo Mania&quot;), the earliest use of interactive music (&quot;Chaos Engine&quot;), working with established recording artists (Betty Boo on &quot;Magic Pockets&quot;, Captain Sensible on &quot;Sensible Soccer&quot;, Brian May on &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; and John Foxx on &quot;Gods&quot; and &quot;Speedball 2&quot;), and featuring vocals in title tunes, which was revolutionary for the time.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he produced soundtracks for development teams Sensible Software and the Bitmap Brothers. He is also credited with the soundtrack to the C64 version of the hit Defender of the Crown.

He then went on to set up Audio Interactive at Pinewood Studios and, along with composer James Hannigan, helped Electronic Arts to win the BAFTA Award for best audio in 2000 for &quot;Theme Park World&quot;. From 1990 onwards Joseph was a frequent musical collaborator with Jon Hare with whom he co-wrote and arranged all of Sensible Software&#x27;s best known musical tracks including the soundtrack for &quot;Cannon Fodder&quot; the GBC version of which was also nominated for a BAFTA in 2000, and is still the only small-format soundtrack to be recognised by BAFTA to this day. In 1995 Hare and Joseph embarked upon an epic 32 track soundtrack for the multimedia product Sex &#x27;n&#x27; Drugs &#x27;n&#x27; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll, signed to Warner Interactive, however in 1998 Warner bowed out of the games market and their Magnum Opus was only ever released as a limited edition audio CD.

After working as Audio Director on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Evil Genius&quot; for Elixir Studios (music composed by James Hannigan), both winning BAFTA nominations for Hannigan&#x27;s scores, Joseph moved to France where he ran SoundTropez, a company offering next-technology soundtracks.

Joseph came from an entertainment family. Brother Eddy is a BAFTA-winning sound supervisor, working on films such as Harry Potter and James Bond. Brother Pat is a director of The Mill which won an Oscar for &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Nephew Alex is a foley supervisor. His father Teddy (1918–2006) was a production executive working on, amongst many others, films by John Schlesinger and Alfred Hitchcock.

After being diagnosed with lung cancer, he died on 4 March 2007 aged 53 years. Wacky Races: Mad Motors is dedicated to him.

<text>Joseph Hill (22 January 1949 – 19 August 2006) was the lead singer and songwriter for the roots reggae group Culture, most famous for their 1977 hit &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot;, but also well known for their &quot;International Herb&quot; single. Hill recorded twenty-two albums.

== Biography ==
===Early life and career===
Joseph Hill was born in 1949 in Linstead, a town in Saint Catherine Parish in the southeast of Jamaica. He was raised in a Christian family and began singing in church at the age of six. Within two years he was making his own musical instruments. After leaving home he came into contact with Rastafarians and adopted the faith.

He began his career in the late 1960s as a percussionist, recording with the Studio One house band the Soul Defenders. He also worked as a sound system deejay, and began performing as a backing vocalist, leading to his singles &quot;Behold the Land&quot; and &quot;Take Me Girl&quot; in the early 1970s. In the early 70s Hill performed with two groups that included future reggae star Glen Washington: C35 Incorporated and Stepping Stone. He performed regularly on the hotel circuit, but had his greatest success with the group Culture.

===Culture===

Hill formed Culture in 1976, and had early success with the prophetic &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot;, predicting apocalypse on 7 July 1977. The record was hugely popular on the emerging punk rock scene in England, heavily influencing The Clash, John Lydon and Public Image.

During the 1970s the group had a string of highly successful singles for producers Joe Gibbs and Sonia Pottinger including the song &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot; which made its mark on both Jamaica and the United Kingdom. It was named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2002 as one of the &quot;50 Coolest Records&quot;, the only single artist reggae album to make the list. The group also had a hit with &quot;Stop Fussing and Fighting&quot;, a song that addressed the chaotic political climate of the late 1970s and the attempt on Bob Marley&#x27;s life.

Joseph Hill and Culture developed a reputation as a performing group after a performance at the One Love Peace Concert in 1978, and was soon regularly touring the United States, Europe and Africa. In recent years the group continued to perform at least one hundred concerts each year, with Hill&#x27;s wife Pauline as road manager. Hill was a presence on stage: part DJ as he directed his band to reconfigure songs on stage and part teacher as he commented on Jamaican history and current political issues. In his lyrics, Hill often explored how the legacy of slavery continued to have an influence on Jamaican citizens.

Hill had received a number of honours; an induction into the Jamaican Reggae Walk of Fame and a 2005 Independence Award presented by the Prime Minister of Jamaica. In 2005 he received the Culture Shock Bronze Medal in recognition of his contribution to Jamaican music.

As a member of the Rastafari movement, Joseph Hill was a worshipper of emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. Indeed, Hill&#x27;s honorific/nickname, &quot;Keeper of Zion Gate&quot; reflects his position as one of reggae&#x27;s and Rastafari&#x27;s greatest voices.

===Death===
Joseph Hill died on a tour bus just after entering Berlin on 19 August 2006. At his funeral in September 2006, Hill was eulogised by, amongst others, Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller who recognised his contributions to Jamaican culture.

His son Kenyatta subsequently took over his role in Culture.

The force of the crash lodged Biggs into the windshield. Mallard then drove home and left the man lodged in the windshield of her car, parked in her garage. He died two to three days later, according to police. Mallard was convicted and sentenced to 50 years imprisonment for murder, but will be eligible for parole in 2027.

==Victim==
Gregory Glenn Biggs was born on August 16, 1964. Although he lived with mental health problems all his adult life, he took care of his son and held a job in construction as a mason. At the moment of the events, Biggs was living in a state of homelessness, but was &quot;on an upswing,&quot; according to his mother.

==Murder==
Chante Jawan Mallard (born June 22, 1976) is a woman from Fort Worth, Texas. On October 26, 2001, Mallard struck Biggs, a pedestrian, with her Chevrolet Cavalier. At the time, Mallard was believed to have been driving while intoxicated by a combination of marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol.

Mallard then drove home, leaving the injured Biggs stuck in her windshield, and parked her car in her garage. After the accident, Mallard did not notify the police nor did she get Biggs any medical attention, even though she was a nursing assistant at the time. Occasionally, she would return to the garage to check on his status. Biggs died two to three days later. Afterwards, Mallard called a male friend, Clete Jackson, for assistance. Mallard, Jackson, and Jackson&#x27;s cousin Herbert Tyrone Cleveland took the body to a park and left it there, even going so far as to set fire to part of the car in an attempt to disguise the evidence. The three were later each convicted on charges of tampering with evidence for this action.

Mallard became a suspect after she was reported talking and laughing about the incident at a party some four months after the events. &quot;I hit this white man,&quot; Mallard allegedly told acquaintance Maranda Daniel, while laughing.

==Trial==
Mallard&#x27;s trial commenced on June 23, 2003. During the trial, Tarrant County medical examiner Nizam Peerwani testified that, had Mallard taken Biggs to a hospital, he would have recovered from his injuries. Other experts testified that they agreed that Biggs would have survived. &quot;There&#x27;s not a member of the Fort Worth Fire Department that could not have saved Mr. Biggs&#x27;s life,&quot; testified fire captain Jim Sowder. Mallard was convicted of murder in June 2003, with the 50-year murder sentence and 10-year tampering sentence to run concurrently. She will be eligible for parole in 2027.

==Aftermath==
A wrongful death lawsuit filed by Biggs&#x27;s son, Brandon, was settled out of court. He later chose to forgive Mallard and the others involved in his father&#x27;s murder. &quot;I want to extend my forgiveness to Chante Mallard and let her know that the Mallard family is in my prayers,&quot; he said in 2003. In response, convicted murderers from around the country raised $10,000 as a college scholarship and had it presented at a ceremony to Brandon, who at the time was a 20-year-old pastoral ministry sophomore at Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie, Texas.

Since finishing his sentence, Clete Denel Jackson, who was imprisoned for helping move Biggs&#x27;s body, has been in and out of prison on firearms- and drug-related charges. He was set to be released again in late November 2017. Mallard&#x27;s relationship with Jackson and Cleveland remains unclear. Jackson&#x27;s lawyer described his client and Mallard as linked romantically, yet relatives of Jackson and Cleveland claim they had never heard of Mallard.

==Media adaptations==
* &quot;Stuck&quot;, a 2007 black comedy thriller film directed by Stuart Gordon and starring Mena Suvari and Stephen Rea.
* An episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (&quot;Darwinian&quot;, aired January 7, 2004)
* The story inspired events in the second season of &quot;Fargo&quot;, in which Peggy Blumquist (Kirsten Dunst) hits Rye Gerhardt (Kieran Culkin) and drives back home with him stuck through the windshield.
* This story also inspired a scene in the third season of the Fox procedural drama &quot;9-1-1&quot; when Stella (Stephanie Lemelin) hits a homeless man after crashing into him with her car. The man is also lodged in the windshield of her car by the impact. Stella suffers a head injury in the crash and drives around town with the man still stuck in her windshield for nearly two days before firefighter Evan Buckley (Oliver Stark) stops her. Unlike the real-life incident, the man on the show survives his injuries after being rushed to the hospital.
