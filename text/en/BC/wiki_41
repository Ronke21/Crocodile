<text>William Lyon Mackenzie (March12, 1795 August28, 1861) was a Scottish Canadian-American journalist and politician. He founded newspapers critical of the Family Compact, a term used to identify elite members of Upper Canada. He represented York County in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and aligned with Reformers. He led the rebels in the Upper Canada Rebellion; after its defeat, he unsuccessfully rallied American support for an invasion of Upper Canada as part of the Patriot War. Although popular for criticising government officials, he failed to implement most of his policy objectives. He is one of the most recognizable Reformers of the early 19th century.

Raised in Dundee, Scotland, Mackenzie emigrated to York, Upper Canada, in 1820. He published his first newspaper, the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; in 1824, and was elected a York County representative to the Legislative Assembly in 1827. York became the city of Toronto in 1834 and Mackenzie was elected its first mayor; he declined the Reformers&#x27; nomination to run in the 1835 municipal election. He lost his re-election for the Legislative Assembly in 1836; this convinced him that reforms to the Upper Canadian political system could only happen if citizens initiated an armed conflict. In 1837, he rallied farmers in the area surrounding Toronto and convinced Reform leaders to support the Upper Canada Rebellion. Rebel leaders chose Mackenzie to be their military commander, but were defeated by government troops at the Battle of Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern.

Mackenzie fled to the United States and rallied US support to invade Upper Canada and overthrow the province&#x27;s government. This violated the Neutrality Act, which prohibits invading a foreign country (with which the United States is not at war) from American territory. Mackenzie was arrested and sentenced to eighteen months&#x27; imprisonment. He was jailed for more than ten months before he was pardoned by the American president Martin Van Buren. After his release, Mackenzie lived in several cities in New York State and tried to publish newspapers, but these ventures failed. He discovered documents that outlined corrupt financial transactions and government appointments by New York State government officials. He published these documents in two books. The parliament of the newly created Province of Canada, formed from the merger of Upper and Lower Canada, granted Mackenzie amnesty in 1849 and he returned to Canada. He represented the constituency of Haldimand County in the province&#x27;s legislature from 1851 to 1858. His health deteriorated in 1861 and he died on August28.

== Early life and immigration (1795–1824) ==
===Background, early years in Scotland, and education===
William Lyon Mackenzie was born on March 12, 1795, in Dundee, Scotland. Both of his grandfathers were part of Clan Mackenzie and fought for Charles Edward Stuart at the Battle of Culloden. His mother, Elizabeth Chambers (née Mackenzie), a weaver and goat herder, was orphaned at a young age. His father, Daniel Mackenzie, was also a weaver and seventeen years younger than Elizabeth. The couple married on May 8, 1794. After attending a public dance, Daniel became sick, blind and bedridden. He died a few weeks after William was born.

Although Elizabeth had relatives in Dundee, she insisted on raising William independently and instructed him on the teachings of the Presbyterian church. Mackenzie reported he was raised in poverty, although the extent of his family&#x27;s wealth is difficult to authenticate. At five years old, Mackenzie received a bursary for a parish grammar school in Dundee. When he was eleven, he used the reading room of the &quot;Dundee Advertiser&quot; newspaper and meticulously documented and summarized the 957 books he read. In 1811, he was a founding member of the Dundee Rational Institution, a club for scientific discussion.

In 1813, William moved to Alyth, Scotland, to help his mother open a general store. He had a sexual relationship with Isabel Reid, and she gave birth to their son James on July 17, 1814. His congregation agreed to baptize James after Mackenzie endured public criticism for fathering an illegitimate child and paid a fine of thirteen shillings and fourpence () to the church. A recession followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, and Mackenzie&#x27;s store went bankrupt. He moved to southern England and worked as a bookkeeper for the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. He spent most of his money on wild behaviour and became a gambler.

===Early years in Canada===

Mackenzie&#x27;s friend John Lesslie suggested they emigrate to Canada in 1820, and the two men travelled there aboard a schooner named &quot;Psyche&quot;. When Mackenzie arrived in North America, he worked in Montreal for the owners of the Lachine Canal as a bookkeeper and &quot;The Montreal Herald&quot; as a journalist. Later that year he moved to York, Upper Canada, and the Lesslie family employed him at a bookselling and drugstore business. He wrote articles for the York &quot;Observer&quot; under the pseudonym Mercator. The Lesslies opened a second shop in Dundas, Upper Canada, and Mackenzie moved there to become its manager.

In 1822, his mother and his son joined Mackenzie in Upper Canada. Elizabeth invited Isabel Baxter to immigrate with them, as she had chosen Baxter to marry her son. Although they were schoolmates, Mackenzie and Baxter did not know each other well before meeting in Upper Canada. The couple wed in Montreal on July 1, 1822, and they had thirteen children. Their daughter Isabel Grace Mackenzie was the mother of Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King.

==The &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; and early years in York (1823–1827)==
===Creation of the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;===
The partnership between the Lesslies and Mackenzie ended in 1823. Mackenzie moved in 1824 to Queenston, a town near Niagara Falls, to open a new general store. A few months later he sold his store and bought a printing press to create the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;, a political newspaper. He refused government subsidies and relied on subscriptions, although he sent free copies to people he considered influential. The newspaper printed articles that supported the policies of the Upper Canadian Reform movement and criticized government officials. He organized a ceremony for the start of the construction of the memorial to Isaac Brock, a British major-general who died in the War of 1812. Mackenzie sealed a capsule within the memorial&#x27;s stonework containing an issue of the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;, the &quot;Upper Canada Gazette&quot;, some coins, and an inscription he had written. Lieutenant governor Peregrine Maitland ordered the capsule&#x27;s removal a few days after it was placed in the monument because of the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;″s critical stance of the government.

In November 1824, Mackenzie relocated the paper and his family to York. Although the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; had the highest circulation among York newspapers, he still lost money on every issue because of low paid subscription numbers and late payments from readers. James Buchanan Macaulay, a government official in York, accused Mackenzie of improper business transactions in 1826 and made jokes about Mackenzie&#x27;s Scottish heritage and his mother. Mackenzie retaliated by pretending to retire from the paper on May 4, 1826, and published a fictitious meeting where contributors selected Patrick Swift as the new editor. Mackenzie used the Swift alias to continue publishing the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;.

===Types Riot===
In the spring of 1826, Mackenzie published articles in the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; under the Swift pseudonym that questioned the governance of the colony and described the personal lives of government officials and their families. On June 8, 1826, rioters attacked the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; office. They harassed Mackenzie&#x27;s family and employees, destroyed the printing press and threw its movable type, the letters a printing press uses to print documents, into the nearby bay. Mackenzie hired Marshall Spring Bidwell to represent him in a civil suit against eight rioters.

Bidwell argued that Mackenzie lost income from the damaged property and his inability to fulfill printing contracts. Upon cross-examination, Mackenzie&#x27;s employees confirmed that Mackenzie authored Patrick Swift&#x27;s editorials in the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;. The court awarded Mackenzie £625 () in damages which he used to pay off his creditors and restart production of his newspaper. One year after the riots, he documented the incident in a series of articles, which he later published as &quot;The History of the Destruction of the Colonial Advocate Press&quot;.

==Reform member of the Legislative Assembly (1827–1834)==

===Election to the Legislative Assembly===

In December 1827, Mackenzie announced his candidacy to become one of the two representatives for the York County constituency in the 10th Parliament of Upper Canada. The Types Riot settlement was used to fund his campaign and he cited the incident as an example of corruption in Upper Canada. Mackenzie ran as an independent and refused to buy alcohol and treats for supporters or bribe citizens to vote for him, as was done by most politicians at this time. He published weekly articles in his newspaper called &quot;The Parliament Black Book for Upper Canada, or Official Corruption and Hypocrisy Unmasked&quot; where he listed accusations of wrongdoing by his opponents. He came in second in the election, becoming one of the representatives for York County.

In parliament, Mackenzie chaired a committee that assessed the effectiveness of the post office and recommended that local officials should determine local postal rates. He also chaired a committee that evaluated the appointment process of officials who administer elections in Upper Canada. He was a member of committees that looked at the banking and currency regulations of Upper Canada, the condition of roads, and the Church of England&#x27;s power. Mackenzie opposed infrastructure projects until the province&#x27;s debt was paid. He spoke against the Welland Canal Company, denouncing the financing methods of William Hamilton Merritt, the company&#x27;s financial agent, and its close links with the Executive Council, the advisory committee to the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada.

In the election for the 11th Parliament of Upper Canada in 1830, Mackenzie campaigned for legislative control of the budget, independent judges, an executive council that would report to the legislature, and equal rights for Christian denominations. He was re-elected to represent York County in the parliament. The Reform group lost their majority in the legislature, mostly because the Legislative Council of Upper Canada blocked the passage of their proposed legislation. In the new parliament, Mackenzie chaired a committee that recommended increased representation for Upper Canadian towns, a single day for voting in elections, and voting by ballot instead of voice.

During a legislative break, Mackenzie travelled to Quebec City and met with Reform leaders in Lower Canada. He wanted to develop closer ties between the Reform leaders of each province and learn new techniques to oppose Upper Canada government policies. He gathered grievances from several communities in Upper Canada and planned to present these petitions to the Colonial Office in England.

=== Expulsions, re-elections, and appeal to the Colonial Office ===
Mackenzie criticized the Legislative Assembly in the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; and called the legislature a &quot;sycophantic office&quot;. For this, the assembly expelled him for libel of the character of the Assembly of Upper Canada. Mackenzie won the resulting by-election on January 2, 1832, by a vote of 119–1. Upon his victory, his supporters gifted him a gold medal worth £250 () and organized a parade through the streets of York. He was expelled again when he printed an article critical of the assemblymen who voted for his first expulsion.

Mackenzie won the second by-election on January 30 with 628 votes against two opponents—a Tory who received 23 votes and a moderate Reformer (who assumed his expulsion barred Mackenzie from becoming a legislator)—who received 96 votes. Mackenzie toured Upper Canada to promote his policies and Tory supporters, unhappy with his agitation, tried to harm him. In Hamilton, William Johnson Kerr organized an assault of Mackenzie by three men. In York, twenty to thirty men stole a wagon he was using as a stage while another mob smashed the windows of the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; office. On March 23, 1832, Mackenzie&#x27;s effigy was carried around York and burned outside the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; office while James FitzGibbon, a magistrate in York, arrested Mackenzie in an attempt to placate the mob. Mackenzie feared for his life and stopped appearing in public until he left for England.

In April 1832, Mackenzie travelled to London to petition the British government for reforms in Upper Canada. He visited Lord Goderich, the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the United Kingdom, to submit the grievances he had collected in Upper Canada. In November 1832, Goderich sent instructions to the Upper Canada lieutenant governor John Colborne to lessen the legislature&#x27;s negative attitude against Mackenzie and reform the province&#x27;s political and financial systems. Tories in Upper Canada were upset that Mackenzie received a positive reception from Goderich and expelled him from the legislature; he was re-elected on November 26 by his constituents. Mackenzie published &quot;Sketches of Canada and the United States&quot; in 1833 to describe Upper Canada politics. The book named thirty members of the Family Compact, the group that governed Upper Canada and controlled its policies. In November 1833, Mackenzie was expelled from the legislature again.

Edward Smith-Stanley replaced Goderich as the colonial secretary and reversed the Upper Canada reforms. Mackenzie was upset by this and, upon his return to Upper Canada in December 1833, renamed the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; to &quot;The Advocate&quot; to signal his displeasure with the province&#x27;s colonial status. During that time he was also re-elected to the legislature by the farmers in York County to fill the vacancy caused by his expulsion the previous month. He won the election by acclamation, but the other members of the legislature would not let him participate in their proceedings and expelled him again. The legislature barred him from sitting as an elected representative until after the 1836 legislative election.

==Upper Canada politics (1834–1836)==
===Municipal politics===
In 1834, York changed its name to Toronto and held elections for its first city council. Mackenzie ran to be an alderman on the council to represent St. David&#x27;s Ward. He won the election on March 27, 1834, with 148 votes, the highest among all candidates for alderman in the city. The other aldermen chose him to be Toronto&#x27;s first mayor by a vote of 10–8. The city council and Mackenzie approved a tax increase to build a boardwalk along King Street despite citizen backlash. He designed the first coat of arms for Toronto and presided as a judge for the city&#x27;s Police Court, which heard cases of drunkenness and disorderly conduct, physical abuse of children and spouses and city bylaw violations. Mackenzie chose the newly built market buildings as Toronto&#x27;s city hall and moved the offices of &quot;The Advocate&quot; into a southern wing of the complex.

In July 1834, Toronto declared a second cholera outbreak. Mackenzie chaired the Toronto Board of Health in his role as mayor, which was tasked to implement the city&#x27;s response to the outbreak. The board was divided between the Tories and the Reformers and they argued over Mackenzie&#x27;s alleged interference with the work of health officers. He remained on the board when it restructured two weeks after the start of the outbreak, although he was no longer its chairman. He brought people to the hospital until he was also infected with the disease and remained in his home until he recovered later that year. Mackenzie declined the nomination for alderman in the 1835 municipal election, printing in his paper that he wanted to focus on provincial politics. Reformers included him on their ticket for the election, and he received the fewest votes in his ward.

===Provincial politics===

In the 1834 election for the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada, Mackenzie&#x27;s York County constituency was split into four, each new section (known as a riding) electing one member. Mackenzie was elected in the 2nd Riding of York by a vote of 334–178. After the election, he sold &quot;The Advocate&quot; to William John O&#x27;Grady because of its debt and to devote more time to his political career.

The legislature appointed Mackenzie as chairman of the Committee on Grievances. which questioned several members of the Family Compact on their work and government efficiency. The committee documented their findings in &quot;The Seventh Report from the Select Committee of the House of Assembly of Upper Canada on Grievances&quot;. The report expressed Mackenzie&#x27;s concern on the excessive power of the executive branch in Upper Canada and the campaigning of government officials for Tory politicians during elections. It also criticized companies that mismanaged funds given to them by the government and the salaries of officials who received patronage appointments. Mackenzie used the Committee on Grievances to investigate the Welland Canal Company. The Upper Canadian government partly owned the company and appointed directors to its board; in 1835 the legislature appointed Mackenzie. He discovered parcels of company land were given to Family Compact members or the Anglican Church for low prices, or swapped with land that was of lesser value. Mackenzie printed his investigation in a newspaper he created that summer in the Niagara peninsula called &quot;The Welland Canal&quot;.

When the new lieutenant governor Francis Bond Head arrived in Upper Canada, Mackenzie believed Bond Head would side with the Reform movement. After meeting Reformers, Bond Head concluded they were disloyal subjects of the British Empire. He wrote, &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s mind seemed to nauseate its subjects&quot; and &quot;with the eccentricity, the volubility, and indeed the appearance of a madman, the tiny creature raved&quot;. Bond Head called an election in July 1836 and asked citizens to show loyalty to the British monarch by voting for Tory politicians. Bond Head&#x27;s campaigning was successful and Reformers across the province lost their elections, Edward William Thomson defeating Mackenzie to represent the 2nd Riding of York in the 13th Parliament. Mackenzie was upset over this loss, weeping in a neighbour&#x27;s home while supporters consoled him. Feeling disenchanted with the Upper Canada political system, Mackenzie created a new newspaper called the &quot;Constitution&quot; on July 4, 1836. The paper accused the government and their supporters of corruption and encouraged citizens to prepare &quot;for nobler actions than our tyrants can dream of&quot;.

==Upper Canada Rebellion (1837–1838)==
===Planning===
In March 1837 the British government rejected reforms in Upper Canada and reconfirmed the authoritarian power of the lieutenant governor. This ended Mackenzie&#x27;s hope that the British government would enact his desired reforms in the colony. In July 1837, Mackenzie organized a meeting with Reformers dubbed the Committee of Vigilance and Mackenzie was selected as the committee&#x27;s corresponding secretary. Mackenzie published a critique of Bond Head describing him as a tyrant upholding a corrupt government. Mackenzie spent the summer of 1837 organizing vigilance committees throughout Upper Canada and proposed self-government for the Upper Canada colony instead of governance by a distant British Parliament. He liked attending these meetings because they confirmed that his politics were aligned with Upper Canadians who were not involved with governing the colony. He attracted large crowds but also faced physical attacks from Family Compact supporters. During the fall of 1837, he visited Lower Canada and met with their rebel leaders, known as the Patriotes.

On October 9, 1837, Mackenzie received a message from the Patriotes asking him to organize an attack on the Upper Canada government. Mackenzie gathered Reformers the following month and proposed seizing control of the Upper Canada government by force, but the meeting did not reach a consensus. He tried to convince John Rolph and Thomas David Morrison, two other Reform leaders, to lead a rebellion. He cited that Upper Canadian troops were sent to suppress the Lower Canada Rebellion and a quick attack on Toronto would allow rebels to seize control of the government before a militia could be organized against them. The two Reformers asked Mackenzie to determine the level of support in the countryside for the revolt. He travelled north and convinced rural Reform leaders that they could forcefully take control of the government. They decided that the rebellion would begin on December 7, 1837, and that Anthony Anderson and Samuel Lount would lead the assembled men. Mackenzie relayed this plan to Rolph and Morrison upon his return to Toronto.

Mackenzie wrote a declaration of independence and printed it at Hoggs Hollow on December 1. A Tory supporter reported the declaration to authorities, and a warrant was issued for Mackenzie&#x27;s arrest. Upon his return to Toronto, Mackenzie discovered that Rolph had sent him a warning about the warrant. When the messenger could not find Mackenzie, he relayed the warning to Lount instead, who responded by marching a group of men towards Toronto to begin the rebellion. Mackenzie attempted to stop Lount but could not reach him in time.

===Rebellion and retreat to the United States===
Lount&#x27;s men arrived at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern on the night of December 4. Later that night Anderson was killed by John Powell during a scouting expedition. Lount refused to lead the rebellion by himself so the group chose Mackenzie as their new leader.

Mackenzie gathered the rebels at noon on December 5 and marched them towards Toronto. At Gallows Hill, Rolph and Robert Baldwin announced the government&#x27;s offer of full amnesty for the rebels if they dispersed immediately. Mackenzie and Lount asked that a convention be organized to discuss the province&#x27;s policies and for the truce to be presented as a written document. Rolph and Baldwin returned, stating the government had withdrawn their offer. Mackenzie grew increasingly erratic and spent the evening punishing Tory families by burning down their houses and trying to force the Upper Canada Postmaster&#x27;s wife to cook meals for his rebellion. Mackenzie tried marching the troops towards the city, but along the way a group of men fired at the rebels, causing them to flee.

Mackenzie spent the next day robbing a mail coach and kidnapping passing travellers to question them about the revolt. He reassured the troops at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern that 200 men were going to arrive from Buffalo, New York, to help with the rebellion. Mackenzie also sent a letter to a newspaper called &quot;The Buffalo Whig and Journal&quot; asking for troops from the United States.

 On December 7, government forces arrived at Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern and fired towards the rebel position. Mackenzie was one of the last to flee north, leaving his papers and cloak behind. He met with rebel leaders who agreed the rebellion was over and that they needed to flee Upper Canada. Bond Head issued a warrant and a £1,000 () reward for Mackenzie&#x27;s apprehension. Mackenzie travelled to the Niagara River and entered the United States by boat.

===Attempted invasion from the United States===
Mackenzie arrived in Buffalo on December 11, 1837, and gave a speech outlining his desire for Upper Canada to be independent of Britain. He blamed the failed rebellion on a lack of weapons and supplies. Josiah Trowbridge, Buffalo&#x27;s mayor, and a newspaper called the &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot; interpreted the speech as a rallying cry for help with the rebellion.

On December 12, Mackenzie asked Rensselaer Van Rensselaer to lead an invasion of Upper Canada. Van Rensselaer would lead Patriot forces, composed of volunteers who sympathized with the cause and were living in the United States. Rebel leaders chose Van Rensselaer because the Van Rensselaer family name would bring respectability to their campaign, his father had been a successful military general in the War of 1812, and he claimed to have military experience. Van Rensselaer, Mackenzie and 24 supporters occupied Navy Island on December 14 and Mackenzie proclaimed the State of Upper Canada on the island, declared Upper Canada&#x27;s separation from the British Empire, proclaimed himself appointed chairman of its new government and wrote a draft for the constitution of the new state. Van Rensselaer planned to use the island as a staging point to invade the Upper Canadian mainland, but this was stopped when their ship, the &quot;Caroline&quot;, was destroyed by British forces in the &quot;Caroline&quot; affair. On January 4, Mackenzie travelled to Buffalo to seek medical help for his wife. On the way he was arrested for violating the Neutrality Act, a law that prohibited participating in an invasion of a country against which the US government had not declared war. He was released on $5,000 () bail, paid by three men in Buffalo, and returned to Navy Island in January. British forces invaded the island on January 4, 1838, and the rebels dispersed to the American mainland.

Mackenzie wanted Canadians to lead the next invasion but still receive American assistance. When Van Rensselaer attempted an invasion of Kingston from Hickory Island, Mackenzie refused to participate, citing a lack of confidence in the mission&#x27;s success. Patriot forces near Detroit attempted to invade Upper Canada but were repelled by British forces. Mackenzie stopped recruiting for the Patriots to avoid ridicule.

==Years in the United States (1838–1849)==
===Support for Patriots and &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Gazette&quot;===
Mackenzie and his wife arrived in New York City and launched &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Gazette&quot; on May 12, 1838, after soliciting subscriptions from friends. Its early editions supported the Patriots and focused on Canadian topics, but pivoted to American politics in August 1838. He suspended publication of his paper in the fall of 1838 and moved to Rochester to rebuild the Patriot forces by creating the Canadian Association. The association struggled to attract Canadian members and unsuccessfully fundraised for Mackenzie to publish an account of the Upper Canada Rebellion. The money was reallocated to Mackenzie&#x27;s defence fund for his upcoming trial. He restarted &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Gazette&quot; in Rochester on February 23, 1839.

===Neutrality law trial===
The trial for Mackenzie&#x27;s violation of American neutrality laws began on June 19, 1839; he represented himself in the proceedings. The district attorney argued that Mackenzie recruited members, established an army, and stole weapons for an invasion. Mackenzie contended that Britain and the United States were at war because the British destroyed an American ship in the &quot;Caroline&quot; affair and the Neutrality Act did not apply. Mackenzie wanted to submit evidence that the Upper Canadian Rebellion was a civil war, as a person cannot be convicted of violating the Neutrality Act if the country is engaged in a civil war. The judge refused to allow this evidence because, according to American law, only the United States Congress can declare if a country is in a civil war, which they did not do. Mackenzie was frustrated and did not call further witnesses.

The judge sentenced Mackenzie to eighteen months in jail and a $10 () fine. Mackenzie did not appeal the ruling after consulting with lawyers. He said after the trial that he was depending upon key witnesses to give testimony, but they did not come to the courtroom. He also denounced the application of neutrality laws, wrongly stating the law had not been applied for nearly fifty years.

===Imprisonment===
Mackenzie was imprisoned on June 21, 1839. He chose to be jailed in Rochester to be closer to his family. He published &quot;The Caroline Almanack&quot; and drew an image of the &quot;Caroline&quot; affair for the cover. He also published issues of the &quot;Gazette&quot;, in which he described the trial and appealed for his release. Later issues reported on the upcoming New York state elections, the 1840 United States elections and the &quot;Durham Report&quot;.

While imprisoned, Mackenzie&#x27;s mother became sick. He was denied permission to see her, so John Montgomery, the tavern keeper of Montgomery&#x27;s Inn during the Upper Canada Rebellion, arranged for him to be a witness at a trial. Montgomery convinced the state attorney to hold the trial in Mackenzie&#x27;s house, and the magistrate stalled the proceedings so Mackenzie could visit his mother. She died a few days later, and Mackenzie witnessed the funeral procession from his prison window. Mackenzie encouraged friends and readers of his newspaper to petition President Martin Van Buren for a pardon, which would release him from imprisonment. Over 300,000 people signed petitions that were circulated in New York State, Michigan, and Ohio. Van Buren did not want others to believe he supported Mackenzie&#x27;s actions and increase hostilities with Britain, so he was reluctant to grant this pardon. Democrats submitted petitions to the United States Congress calling for Mackenzie&#x27;s release. Van Buren believed it was politically easier to release Mackenzie from prison than explain his imprisonment to fellow Democrats, so on May 10, 1840, Van Buren granted Mackenzie a pardon. 

===After the pardon===
After a summer hiatus, the &quot;Gazette&quot; denounced all invasions into Canada and supported Van Buren&#x27;s re-election. The paper&#x27;s subscriptions continued to decline and the last issue was published on December 23, 1840. In April, he launched &quot;The Rochester Volunteer&quot; and printed articles criticising Canadian Tory legislators. The &quot;Volunteer&quot; stopped production in September 1841 because the newspaper was not profitable or politically influential. Mackenzie moved back to New York City in June 1842.

Mackenzie worked for several publishers but refused to accept a job as an editor. He became an American citizen in April 1843. He wrote a biography of 500 Irish patriots entitled, &quot;The Sons of the Emerald Isle&quot;; the first volume was published on February 21, 1844. The goal of the series was to stop nativist attitudes towards immigrants to North America by reminding Americans that their ancestors were also immigrants. Mackenzie attended the founding meeting of the National Reform Association in February 1844. Its goal was to distribute public lands to people who would live on the property, limit the amount of land an individual could own, and outlaw the confiscation of free homesteads given to settlers. He spoke at many meetings and remained on the association&#x27;s central committee until July 1844.

In July 1844, Mackenzie was nominated as an inspector at the New York custom house, but this was withdrawn after American Whig newspapers criticized him for being an immigrant. He was instead appointed as a clerk in the custom house&#x27;s archives office. Mackenzie copied the private letters of Jesse Hoyt, a New York State politician, which described negotiations for financial transactions in exchange for government appointments by New York State government officials. After submitting his resignation from the custom house in June 1845, Mackenzie published some of the letters as &quot;Lives and Opinions of Benjamin Franklin Butler and Jesse Hoyt&quot;. It sold 50,000 copies and made $12,000 () in profit before an injunction stopped the book&#x27;s sale. The pamphlet&#x27;s profits were given to the publishers because Mackenzie did not want to benefit from exposing a scandal. In April 1846, Mackenzie published another book based on Hoyt&#x27;s letters called &quot;Life and Times of Martin Van Buren: The Correspondence of His Friends, Family, and Pupils&quot;. This book criticized Van Buren and contained Mackenzie&#x27;s commentary on American politics.

In October 1845, Mackenzie published the second volume of &quot;The Sons of the Emerald Isle&quot;. Horace Greeley hired him to go to Albany, New York, and report on the New York State Constitutional Convention for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;. He continued to work for the &quot;Tribune&quot; until his resignation in April 1848.

==Return to Canada (1849–1858)==
===Amnesty and return to Canada===
After the Upper Canada Rebellion, British colonial officials sent Lord Durham to investigate its causes. Durham sent an agent to interview Mackenzie for the report, who told the agent that his grievance against the Upper Canadian government was the composition of the Legislative Council and his desire &quot;to lift the hand of tyranny from the soil&quot;. Durham&#x27;s finding were presented to the British government as the &quot;Durham Report&quot; and recommended that Upper and Lower Canada be merged into the Province of Canada, which occurred in 1840. After the 1848 election, Reformers held a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the BaldwinLafontaine ministry was formed.

In 1849 there were revolutionary movements in Europe, including one for an independent Ireland. Lord Elgin, the Governor-General of the Province of Canada and the British monarch&#x27;s representative to the colony, was concerned that Canadians would become disloyal to the British crown. He hoped that granting amnesty for participants of the 1837 rebellions, on behalf of the monarchy, would increase Canada&#x27;s loyalty to Britain. The passage of this general amnesty bill in the Canadian Legislature in 1849 allowed Mackenzie to return to Canada.

Mackenzie travelled to Montreal in February and his arrival caused his effigy to be burned in Kingston and riots in Belleville and Toronto. He returned to New York on April 4 and documented his visit in &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Journey through the Canadas&quot;. Horace Greeley hired Mackenzie to assemble Whig almanacs and the &quot;Business Men&#x27;s Almanack&quot;, which were published in 1850. Mackenzie moved to Toronto in May 1850 with his family, wrote weekly articles for the &quot;Tribune&quot; and contributed to the &quot;Examiner&quot; and &quot;The Niagara Mail&quot;. York County and the provincial government accepted his claim for income he did not receive in the 1830s as a public servant and Welland Canal Company commissioner.

===Return to the Legislature===

In February 1851 David Thompson, the representative for Haldimand County in the Parliament of Canada, died. Mackenzie ran as a candidate in the subsequent by-election, promising to be an independent voice in the legislature. He claimed that the government supported his opponent George Brown&#x27;s campaign and Brown would be beholden to them if elected. Mackenzie won the by-election with 294 votes, defeating Brown and , who both claimed to be running as Reformers, and Ronald McKinnon, the Tory Party candidate. In the legislature, Mackenzie proposed abolishing the Court of Chancery, which Robert Baldwin had reorganized. Mackenzie believed the court was too expensive to maintain and denounced its practice of taking written testimony instead of having lawyers speak before the judges. The majority of Canada West (formerly known as Upper Canada) legislators supported Mackenzie&#x27;s proposal. The lack of support from Baldwin&#x27;s colleagues for his project caused him to resign from the Canadian cabinet. In the October 1851 election, Mackenzie campaigned against moderate Reformers like Baldwin, Francis Hincks and James Hervey Price in their constituencies while winning his own election in Haldimand County with 63% of the vote.

Mackenzie refused to participate in the 1852 negotiations to merge the Reform movement with the Clear Grits, a new political movement in Canada West. On October 5, 1852, Mackenzie wrote a letter to the &quot;Examiner&quot; that Lesslie wanted to edit before printing. Mackenzie rejected the edits and Lesslie did not publish any of Mackenzie&#x27;s letters. Losing his only way to communicate with his constituents, Mackenzie began his own newspaper on December 25, 1852, called &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Weekly Message&quot;, which he later renamed the &quot;Toronto Weekly Message&quot;. Mackenzie faced a difficult re-election campaign in 1854 for his Haldimand seat. Local newspapers complained he only came to the constituency during elections and his colleagues in the assembly had a negative opinion of Mackenzie. His positions against religious school boards caused some voters to withdraw their support. He won the election by 54 votes, a smaller majority than in the previous election.

In the 5th Parliament of the Province of Canada, Mackenzie opposed the MacNab–Morin coalition government and denounced Reform members who supported the administration. He believed it was unconstitutional when Lord Elgin did not give Reform legislators a chance to form a government before accepting a Tory coalition. He was chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts while its reports criticized the province&#x27;s disorganized record-keeping and exposed government expenditures that parliament had not approved. Mackenzie proposed a resolution that condemned previous administrations for similar acts and parliament removed him from the committee in retaliation.

In 1855, Mackenzie&#x27;s health deteriorated and in February he closed the &quot;Toronto Weekly Message&quot;. He wrote columns for &quot;Examiner&quot; until it merged with &quot;The Globe&quot; in August 1855. In December 1855, he revived the &quot;Message&quot; and published the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Almanac&quot; in April 1856, outlining his arguments to split the union of Upper and Lower Canada. Mackenzie felt that tax revenue from Upper Canada was subsidizing infrastructure projects in Lower Canada and that the union maintained duplicate government officials, records and executives for Canada East (formerly known as Lower Canada) and Canada West.

In the 1857 election, Mackenzie was narrowly reelected to the constituency of Haldimand with 38% of the vote. He accepted Brown&#x27;s invitation to caucus with opposition members against the Macdonald–Cartier administration. When the government was defeated, he supported the Brown–Dorion administration, although he criticized the differing viewpoints of ministers and was disappointed when he was not appointed to be a minister. Mackenzie resigned his seat on August 16, 1858, calling the legislature illegitimate after the Governor-General reinstated the Macdonald–Cartier administration without an election.

==Later life and death (1858–1861)==
At the end of 1858, Mackenzie collected petitions for the dissolution of the Province of Canada and planned to deliver them to the Colonial Office in England. The Homestead Fund, set up by James Lesslie to financially support Mackenzie, refused to fund the trip, so he travelled to New York to fundraise. He was unsuccessful so he cancelled his trip and returned to Toronto. He wrote &quot;Almanac for Independence and Freedom for 1860&quot;, which outlined arguments for dissolving the Province of Canada. In October he moved to a home in Toronto purchased by the Homestead Fund and ended publication of the &quot;Message&quot; on September 15, 1860, because of a lack of subscriptions.

In 1861 his health deteriorated and he refused to take medication. At the end of August, he went into a coma and died on August28. His funeral procession stretched a half-mile (0.8 km) and included Reformers and Family Compact members. He was buried at Toronto Necropolis. A twelve-foot Celtic cross made of grey granite serves as a grave marker. He is buried with his wife, four of his children, his son-in-law Charles Lindsey, and his descendants.

==Writing style==
Mackenzie wrote about current events and topics he was thinking about at a particular moment. His writing format often lacked structure and used obscure references difficult for today&#x27;s readers to understand. Historian Lillian F. Gates struggled to comprehend &quot;The Life and Times of Martin Van Buren&quot; because Mackenzie did not describe events chronologically and in her opinion used too many footnotes and large lists. Frederick Armstrong, another historian, said Mackenzie used long examples and had &quot;excursions into trivia&quot;. William Kilbourn critiqued &quot;Sketches of Canada and the United States&quot; as unconcerned with conventional storytelling techniques or &quot;a sense of order&quot;, and Charles Lindsey described the book as disregarding the order of the stories.

Kilbourn stated the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot;″s articles were better when read aloud and thought Mackenzie&#x27;s slow pace was similar to &quot;a three-volume Victorian novel&quot;. He described &quot;The Constitution&quot; as &quot;baroque convolutions of style&quot; adding &quot;their harsh jumble of book learning are really not for the printed page&quot;. Anthony W. Rasporich differed in his analysis of Mackenzie&#x27;s writing and believed it was exciting for both subscribers in the 1800s and contemporary readers in 1972. Mackenzie ignored possible consequences when publishing his work and chronicled other people&#x27;s situations to explain complicated financial concepts. He sometimes plagiarized other newspapers, did not attribute direct quotations, and invented misattributed quotations. He also printed information after promising his sources that he would not.

==Political philosophy and views==
===Political philosophy===

Mackenzie promoted a wide range of policies but was never the lead advocate on any issue. He believed that a person&#x27;s political ideas should be shaped by their experience and that politicians should be willing to change their political position on an issue. This belief caused Mackenzie to frequently change the issues for which he advocated and his position on government policy. He constantly disagreed with the province&#x27;s administrators and refused to compromise, believing political institutions were corrupt. Mackenzie chose his political positions impulsively and replaced rational arguments with energetic actions.

Mackenzie&#x27;s articles in his newspapers favoured radical reform causes. He followed a political theory that believed outlining problems publicly would lead to solutions. He professed in the &quot;Colonial Advocate&quot; he was a British Whig but became a Jacksonian democrat of the Locofocos faction after meeting Andrew Jackson in 1829. One of Mackenzie&#x27;s biographers, John Charles Dent, said his policies aligned with Conservative Party policies of the 1880s. John King, Mackenzie&#x27;s son-in-law, disagreed and stated all Canadian political parties adopted Mackenzie&#x27;s policies and called him a Liberal. Armstrong described Mackenzie in the 1850s as politically left of the Clear Grits. John Sewell, a biographer of Mackenzie and mayor of Toronto in 1978, said previous biographers described Mackenzie as radical but that current scholars regard him as &quot;an ideologue ranting against the Family Compact&quot;.

The social causes Mackenzie supported were conservative for their time. He adopted a puritanical outlook towards gambling and prostitution and wanted women to return to an agrarian lifestyle of taking care of the home. He opposed performers coming to York because of their amoral skits and double entendres. Rasporich described his editorials on Jews, Catholics, French Canadians and black people as prejudiced and in opposition to reform causes. According to Armstrong, Mackenzie&#x27;s views on minority groups depended on their support for his policies; he was not concerned with the social standing of impoverished or oppressed people. The income gap between the richest and poorest people in Great Britain disturbed Mackenzie and he wanted to avoid this disparity in North America.

Mackenzie wanted the Canadian colonies to keep the Constitution of the United Kingdom but believed British institutions had to be modified for the Upper Canadian social structure and agrarian society. He opposed Upper Canada&#x27;s lack of representation in the British legislature, especially when they passed legislation governing the province. He supported responsible government to solve the conflicts between the Legislative Assembly and Executive Council of Upper Canada. He wanted to include American ideas, like the election of town magistrates and governors, but avoided publicizing these opinions until 1832 because of public sentiment in Upper Canada was against American political institutions. When exiled to the United States, Mackenzie declared himself a believer in social democracy and the equality of everyone in society and the law.

===Religious views===
Elizabeth Mackenzie gave her son a Presbyterian seceder education. William rebelled against the religion in his youth, but he returned to it upon his arrival to Canada and remained faithful for the rest of his life. He was less reliant on faith after reading texts from the Age of Enlightenment and his religious practice was not an important part of his values. Mackenzie believed clergy should advocate for equality among citizens and opposed clergy who tried to maintain the status quo in the United States and Canada. In the 1830 election, he campaigned for equal rights for religious denominations. He was against attacking Catholics or Protestants for their religious beliefs and believed all Christian denominations persecuted other faiths at different points in their history. He criticized the Papacy in the &quot;Message&quot; in 1859.

Mackenzie initially praised clergy reserves and their role in creating a colonial upper class, although he believed all Christian denominations should benefit from them. Mackenzie changed his position between 1824 and 1830 and opposed government funding to churches. He criticized a government grant given to British Wesleyans to proselytize to indigenous communities in Upper Canada, causing Egerton Ryerson and Methodists to withdraw their support for the Reform movement in 1833. In his State of Upper Canada constitution, Mackenzie proposed religious equality and a separation of the government and religious institutions. His state would transfer ownership of clergy reserves to the legislature and distribute funds from their sale to municipalities. He wanted to abolish a religious test for employment and services and opposed creating an established church within Upper Canada.

===Economic policies===
Mackenzie&#x27;s economic policies focused on an agrarian structure where agriculture was the foundation of an economy. His ideal economic society contained educated farmers and small business owners served by printing presses. His State of Upper Canada constitution proposed a ban on banks and trading companies, declaring the only way to generate wealth was through labour. He wanted labourers to profit from their work instead of giving payments to privileged politicians, religious leaders or economic institutions. He was against anything perceived as a monopoly and worked to dismantle banking institutions and end a printers union strike in 1836.

Mackenzie struggled to understand how stocks and banknotes denoted wealth. His State of Upper Canada constitution established gold and silver as the only legal tender and would only use coins as currency, whose value the legislature would regulate. He was critical of granting state aid or privileges to companies that would make them monopolies. He wanted tougher laws for lending money to corporations. In 1859, he proposed a requirement for three-fourths of members in parliament, and approval from the government leader, before the government could provide a loan. He opposed farmers buying land on credit because it caused them to buy more property than they could afford. Mackenzie wanted the government to give free plots of land to immigrants or allow people to work in government projects to save enough money for land purchases. He supported tariffs to stop lower-priced products from entering Canadian markets. In the 1830s, he advocated letting the province choose which countries it could trade with because it gave farmers access to cheaper goods and reduced Upper Canada&#x27;s dependence on British markets.

==Legacy==
===Historical reputation===
Upon his death, newspapers printed obituaries emphasizing Mackenzie&#x27;s independence, desire for honest public administration, and misguided patriotism. George Brown wrote he was &quot;a man of impulse, prompt in action, full of courage and fire&quot;. John King called him &quot;one of the greatest Liberal leaders in Canada&quot;. Historian Albert Schrauwers described Mackenzie as the &quot;best-known reformer&quot; of the early 1800s.

John Dent criticized Mackenzie&#x27;s leadership of the Upper Canada Rebellion and his personal character. His research was refuted by Mackenzie&#x27;s son James and John King, the latter publishing his opinion as &quot;The Other Side of the &quot;Story&quot;&quot;. A manuscript written by William Dawson LeSueur for the &quot;Makers of Canada&quot; series was rejected by its publishers because it did not portray Mackenzie as an influencer in Canada&#x27;s creation. Instead, the publishers asked Lindsey and his son to condense Lindsey&#x27;s previous biography for its inclusion in the series.

Mackenzie emphasized the moral and political failings of the government but was unsure of how to create his ideal society. His term as mayor was overshadowed by a desire to reform government institutions instead of focusing on the problems of the city. His policy proposals were often rejected as politically impossible to implement. Many of Mackenzie&#x27;s biographers agree that he delayed the implementation of responsible government because the Upper Canada Rebellion caused an exodus of Reform politicians from the colony.

===Memorials===

Mackenzie&#x27;s last home was designated as a historical site in 1936 to prevent its demolition. The Mackenzie Homestead Foundation turned the building into the Mackenzie House museum and operated the facility until it was sold to the City of Toronto in 1960. The William Lyon Mackenzie Centennial Committee commissioned a monument to Mackenzie which was sculpted by Walter Seymour Allward and placed in Queen&#x27;s Park west of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1940. A plaque which was dedicated to Mackenzie was erected in his home city of Dundee next to the Steeple Church. Dennis Lee included Mackenzie in his poem &quot;1838&quot; and John Robert Colombo called Mackenzie a hero in &quot;The Mackenzie Poems&quot;. In 1976, Rick Salutin wrote a play about Mackenzie and the Upper Canada Rebellion called &quot;1837: The Farmers&#x27; Revolt&quot;. In 1991 a group of volunteers opened the Mackenzie Printery museum in Mackenzie&#x27;s Queenston home to document the newspaper industry in North America.

In the Spanish Civil War Canadian volunteers formed the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion, naming it after Mackenzie and the leader of the Lower Canada Rebellion, Louis-Joseph Papineau. In 1960, Southview Collegiate in North York was renamed William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute after students suggested the name. The Toronto Fire Services named a fireboat the &quot;William Lyon Mackenzie&quot; in 1964. &quot;The Rebel Mayor&quot;, a Twitter account which posted satirical comments on candidates in Toronto&#x27;s 2010 mayoral election, was written in Mackenzie&#x27;s persona. Shawn Micallef, a journalist for &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; and &quot;Spacing&quot; magazine, created the feed.

<text>Livorno () is a port city on the Ligurian Sea on the western coast of the Tuscany region of Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Livorno, having a population of 152,914 residents in January 2023. It was traditionally known in English as Leghorn (pronounced , or ).

During the Renaissance, Livorno was designed as an &quot;ideal town&quot;. Developing considerably from the second half of the 16th century by the will of the House of Medici, Livorno was an important free port. Its intense commercial activity was largely dominated by foreign traders. Also the seat of consulates and shipping companies, it became the main port-city of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The high status of a multiethnic and multicultural Livorno lasted until the second half of the nineteenth century, when it was surpassed by other cities. Evidence of that prosperous time can be seen in the many churches, villas, and palaces of the city.

Livorno is considered to be the most modern among all the Tuscan cities, and is the third most-populous of the region, after Florence and Prato.

== History ==


===Origins===
The origins of Livorno are controversial, although the place was inhabited since the Neolithic Age. This is documented by the worked bones, and pieces of copper and ceramic found on the Livorno Hills in a cave between Ardenza and Montenero. The Etruscan settlement was called Labro. 

The construction of the Via Aurelia coincided with the occupation of the region by the Romans. They are also known for their toponyms and the ruins of towers. The natural cove called Liburna is a reference to the type of ship, the liburna, adopted by Roman navy from the Liburnians. Other ancient toponyms include &quot;Salviano&quot; (Salvius) and &quot;Antignano&quot; (Ante ignem), which was the place situated before &quot;Ardenza&quot; (Ardentia), where beacons directed the ships to Porto Pisano. Cicero mentioned Liburna in a letter to his brother, in which he called it Labrone.

=== Medieval ===
Livorna is mentioned for the first time in 1017 as a small coastal village, the port and the remains of a Roman tower under the rule of Lucca. In 1077, a tower was built by Matilda of Tuscany. The Republic of Pisa owned Livorna from 1103 and built a quadrangular fort called &quot;Quadratura dei Pisani&quot; (&quot;Quarter of the Pisans&quot;) to defend the port. &quot;Porto Pisano&quot; was destroyed after the crushing defeat of the Pisan fleet in the Battle of Meloria in 1284. 

In 1399, Pisa sold Livorna to the Visconti of Milan; in 1405 it was sold to the Republic of Genoa; and on 28 August 1421 it was bought by the Republic of Florence. The name &#x27;Leghorn&#x27; was derived from the Genoese name Ligorna. &quot;Livorno&quot; was used certainly in the eighteenth century by Florentines.

Between 1427 and 1429, a census counted 118 families in Livorno, including 423 persons. Monks, Jews, military personnel, and the homeless were not included in the census. The only remainder of medieval Livorno is a fragment of two towers and a wall, located inside the Fortezza Vecchia.

===Medicean period (1500–1650)===
After the arrival of the Medici, the ruling dynasty of Florence, some modifications were made in the city. Between 1518 and 1534 the &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; was constructed, and the voluntary resettlement of the population to Livorno was stimulated. Livorno still remained a rather insignificant coastal fortress. By 1551, the population had grown to 1562 residents.

Seat of the crusading and corsairing Order of Saint Stephen after 1561, distinctive for its aggressive approach towards the Muslim world, Livorno became a major Mediterranean slave trade hub in the early modern period, rivalling Malta&#x27;s. Its share of slave population may have been over a 25% of the population.

During the Italian Renaissance, when the settlement was ruled by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany of the House of Medici, Livorno was designed as an &quot;Ideal town&quot;. In 1577 the architect Bernardo Buontalenti drew up the first plan. The new fortified town had a pentagonal design, for which it is called &quot;Pentagono del Buontalenti&quot;, incorporating the original settlement. The &quot;Porto Mediceo&quot; was overlooked and defended by towers and fortresses leading to the town centre.

In the late 1580s, Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, declared Livorno a free port (&quot;porto franco&quot;), which meant that the goods traded here were duty-free within the area of the town&#x27;s control. 

In 1593, the Duke&#x27;s administration established the &quot;Leggi Livornine&quot; to regulate trade. These laws protected merchant activities from crime and racketeering, and instituted laws regarding international trade. The laws established a well-regulated market and were in force until 1603. Also expanding Christian tolerance, the laws offered the right of public freedom of religion and amnesty to people having to gain penance from clergy in order to conduct civil business. The Grand Duke attracted numerous Turks, Persians, Moors, Greeks, and Armenians, along with Jewish immigrants. Sephardic Jews began to immigrate to Livorno in the late sixteenth century, following the Alhambra Decree and expulsion of Jews from Spain and Portugal. Livorno extended rights and privileges to them, and they contributed greatly to the mercantile wealth and scholarship in the city.

Livorno became an enlightened European city and one of the most important ports of the entire Mediterranean Basin. Many European foreigners moved to Livorno. These included Christian Protestant reformers who supported such leaders as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and others. French, Dutch, and English arrived, along with Orthodox Greeks. Meanwhile, Jews continued to trade under their previous treaties with the Grand Duke. On 19 March 1606, Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici elevated Livorno to the rank of city; the ceremony was held in the &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; Chapel of Francis of Assisi.
The Counter-Reformation increased tensions among Christians; dissidents to the Papacy were targeted by various Catholic absolute rulers. Livorno&#x27;s tolerance declined during the European wars of religion. But, in the preceding period, the merchants of Livorno had developed a series of trading networks with Protestant Europe, and the Dutch, British, and Germans worked to retain these. In 1653 a naval battle, the Battle of Leghorn, was fought near Livorno during the First Anglo-Dutch War.

===17th century and later===
At the end of the 17th century, Livorno underwent a period of great urban planning and expansion. Near the defensive pile of the Old Fortress, a new fortress was built, together with the town walls and the system of navigable canals through neighbourhoods. After the port of Pisa had silted up in the 13th century, its distance from the sea increased and it lost its dominance in trade. Livorno took over as the main port in Tuscany. By 1745 Livorno&#x27;s population had risen to 32,534.

The more successful of the European powers re-established trading houses in the region, especially the British with the Levant Company. In turn, the trading networks grew, and with those, Britain&#x27;s cultural contact with Tuscany. An increasing number of British writers, artists, philosophers, and travellers visited the area and developed the unique historical ties between the two communities. The British referred to the city in English as &quot;Leghorn&quot;, derived from the Genoese term. Through the centuries, the city&#x27;s trade fortunes fell and rose according to the success or failure of the Great Powers. The British and their Protestant allies were important to its trade.

During the Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars of the late eighteenth century, Napoleon&#x27;s troops occupied Livorno along with the rest of Tuscany. Under the Continental System, the French prohibited trade with Britain, and the economy of Livorno suffered greatly. The French had altogether taken over Tuscany by 1808, incorporating it into the Napoleonic empire. After the Congress of Vienna, Austrian rule replaced the French.

In 1861, Italy succeeded in its wars of unification. At that time the city counted 96,471 inhabitants. Livorno and Tuscany became part of the new Kingdom of Italy and, as part of the Kingdom, the town lost its status as a free port. The city&#x27;s commercial importance declined.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Livorno had numerous public parks housing important museums such as the &quot;Museo Civico Giovanni Fattori&quot;, &quot;Museo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo&quot;, and cultural institutions as the &quot;Biblioteca Labronica F.D. Guerrazzi&quot; and others in Neoclassical style as &quot;Cisternone&quot;, &quot;Teatro Goldoni&quot; and Liberty style as &quot;Palazzo Corallo&quot;, &quot;Mercato delle Vettovaglie&quot;, &quot;Stabilimento termale Acque della Salute&quot;, the &quot;Scuole elementari Benci&quot; all the last on project by Angiolo Badaloni.
In the early 19th century, the American Elizabeth Ann Seton converted from Protestantism to Catholicism while visiting Italian friends in Livorno. She later was canonized as the first American-born saint.

During the 1930s, numerous villas were built on the avenue along the sea in Liberty style based on designs by Cioni. These added to the architectural richness of the city.

Livorno suffered extensive damage during World War II. Many historic sites and buildings were destroyed by bombs of the Allies preceding their invasion of Italy, including the cathedral and Synagogue of Livorno.
Since the late 20th century, Livorno&#x27;s residents have become well known for their left-wing politics. The Italian Communist Party was founded in Livorno in 1921.

== Climate ==
Livorno has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). Summers have warm days with the heat lingering on throughout the night, hence going above the subtropical threshold in spite of its relatively high latitude. Winters are mild for the latitude due to the moderating influence from the Mediterranean Sea. Precipitation is in a wet winter/dry summer pattern as with all climates fitting the Mediterranean definition.


==Population==
=== Foreigner minorities===

====Armenian community====

Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany issued in 1591 a decree encouraging Armenians to settle in Livorno to increase its trade with the Ottoman Empire and western Asia. By the beginning of the 17th century, Armenians operated 120 shops in town. In 1701 the Armenian community, who were members of the Armenian Apostolic Church, were authorized to build their own church, which they dedicated to Gregory the Illuminator. The project was by Giovanni Battista Foggini and the church was completed a few years later but did not open for worship until 1714. The church had a Latin cross plant and a dome at the intersection of the transept and nave. Destroyed during World War II, it was partly restored in 2008 but is not open to worship.

==== Greek community ====
The first Greeks who settled in Livorno early in the 16th century were former mercenaries in the fleet of Cosimo de&#x27; Medici and their descendants. This community grew and became significant in the 18th and 19th centuries when Livorno became one of the principal hubs of the Mediterranean trade. Most of the new Greek immigrants came from western Greece, Chios, Epirus and Cappadocia.

Based on its status since the late 16th century as a free port (&quot;port franc&quot;) and the warehouses constructed for long-term storage of goods and grains from the Levant, until the late 19th century Livorno enjoyed a strong strategic position related to Greek mercantile interests in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the North Atlantic. The conflicts between Great Britain and France during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, with associated port embargoes, piracy, and confiscation of cargoes, played out to the advantage of those Greek merchants willing to accept risk. By the 1820s, Greek entrepreneurs gradually replaced the Protestant British, Dutch, French and other merchants who left the city.

The Greeks concentrated on the grain market, banking and ship-brokering. Cargoes of wheat from the Black Sea were received at Livorno, before being re-shipped to England. Returning ships carried textiles and other industrial goods, which Greek merchants shipped to Alexandria and other destinations in the Ottoman Empire. Chians controlled much of the trade. In 1839 Livorno had ten major commercial houses, led primarily by ethnic Greeks and Jewish Italians.

The ethnic Greek community () had a distinctive cultural and social identity based on their common Greek Orthodox religion, language and history. In 1775 they established the Confraternity of Holy Trinity () and the , the second non-Catholic church in Tuscany. The Armenians had earlier built their own Orthodox church. The community founded a Greek school, awarding scholarships for higher studies to young Greeks from the Peloponnese, Epirus, Chios or Smyrna. The community raised funds to support the Greek War of Independence of 1821, as well as various Greek communities in the Ottoman Empire and in Italy.

It also assisted non-Greeks. The Rodocanachi family financed the &quot;School of Mutual Education&quot; established in Livorno by the pedagogist . The community contributed to founding a school for poor Catholic children. The local governing authorities recognized the contributions of distinguished members of the Greek community (e.g. members of the Papoudoff, Maurogordatos, Rodocanachi, and other families) and granted them titles of nobility. After unification and the founding of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the Greek community in Livorno declined, as the privileges of the free port were rescinded.

==== Jewish community====
See the history of the Jews in Livorno.

=== Dialects ===
;Vernacolo
Livorno inhabitants speak a variant of the Italian Tuscan dialect, known as a &quot;vernacolo&quot;. &quot;Il Vernacoliere&quot;, a satirical comic-style magazine printed chiefly in the Livornese dialect, was founded in 1982 and is now nationally distributed.

;Bagitto
The &quot;bagitto&quot; was a Judæo-Italian regional dialect once used by the Jewish community in Livorno. It was a language based on Italian, developed with words coming from Tuscan, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew and Yiddish; the presence of Portuguese and Spanish words is due to the origin of the first Jews who came to Livorno, having been expelled from the Iberian peninsula in the late 15th century.

== Points of interest==
===Civil architecture===
====&quot;Venezia Nuova&quot;====
Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici considered, in 1629, the opportunity to enlarge the town, on project by Giovanni Battista Santi, toward north in an area included among &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; and &quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot;, in order to give an adequate space to the maritime and commercial activities. There was the need to build a mercantile district, close to &quot;Porto Mediceo&quot;, provided with houses and depots to store the merchandise and a system of canals to facilitate their transport. The new &quot;rione&quot; (district), called &quot;&quot;, was built in an area gained to the sea, intersected by canals and linked to the town with bridges, for this reason, Venetians skilled workers were recruited.

The &quot;Chiesa di Sant&#x27;Anna&quot;, dedicated to Saint Anne, was built in 1631 on the ground of the Arch confraternity of the Company of the Nativity; in the same year Giovanni Battista Santi died and the control of the project passed to Giovanni Francesco Cantagallina though the works slowed down due to the lack of funds.

A new impulse to the works was given in 1656 concerning the distribution of the spaces where to build other houses and stores; consequently arose the problem of the diverse oriented road scheme with respect to the axis of &quot;Piazza d’Arme&quot;, it was resolved by adopting a road plan perpendicular to the Navicelli channel. The paving of the roads and along the canals in &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; was provided in 1668, while the &quot;Pescheria Nuova&quot; (New fish market) was built in 1705 close to the &quot;Scali del Pesce&quot; where the fish was unloaded.

In the 1700s &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; was the district of the Consuls of the Nations and of the most important international retailers who had the warehouses filled with goods from everywhere waiting to be shipped by sea to the most different destinations. The palaces along the canals had the turrets from which to see the ships approaching the port, moreover, they had the stores at the canal level to facilitate the unloading of the goods from the boats.

The &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; district retains much of its original town planning and architectural features such as the bridges, narrow lanes, the houses of the nobility, churches as Santa Caterina da Siena and San Ferdinando, and a dense network of canals that once served to link its warehouses to the port.

====&quot;Monumento dei quattro mori&quot;====
The Monument of the Four Moors is dedicated to Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and is one of the most popular monuments of Livorno. Ferdinando I commissioned it to Giovanni Bandini in 1595 to carry out a monument in white Carrara marble to represent him in the uniform of the Grand master of the Order of Saint Stephen which in that period prevailed in several naval battles against the Barbary pirates. The monument was completed in 1599, shortly before the death of Bandini which occurred on 18 April,
and arrived to Livorno by sea from Carrara in 1601.

Ferdinando I projected to add four statues of moors prisoners at the pedestal of his monument and gave the task to Pietro Tacca in 1602 but the monument remained in a corner of the square till 29 May 1617 when it was inaugurated by Cosimo II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In the meantime Tacca received the approval to add the four moors to the pedestal; the first two statues were fused in Florence in 1622 and carried on the barges along the Arno to Livorno; according to the tradition the young moor was named Morgiano and the older Alì Salentino; the other two sculptures were installed in 1626. During the French occupation of Livorno, from 1796 to 1799, the monument was removed from Sextius Mollis commander of the French garrison because it represented an insult to the tyranny, as soon as the French left the town the monument was put back in its former place.

During World War II the monument was transferred to a protected place in order to avoid being damaged by allied attacks, the statue of Ferdinando I was hidden in the Pisa Charterhouse and the four moors in the Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano.
The monument has been restored recently in 1990 and 2013.

====&quot;Acquedotto Leopoldino&quot;====
The &quot;Acquedotto Leopoldino&quot; and the neoclassical cisterns of Livorno were part of a sophisticated scheme to provide water to Livorno.

====&quot;La Gran Conserva&quot;====
&quot;La Gran Conserva&quot;, or &quot;Il Cisternone&quot;, situated on what were the outskirts of 19th-century Livorno, is the largest and best known of the city&#x27;s covered cisterns.

====&quot;Cisternino di città&quot;====
&quot;Cisternino di città&quot; is an austere neoclassical design which was approved in 1837 and completed in 1848.

====&quot;Piazza della Repubblica&quot;====
At the beginning of the 19th century arose the need to connect the Medicean road system of the &quot;Pentagono del Buontalenti&quot; to the new eastern districts of the town, on the other side of the &quot;Fosso Reale&quot;, and the requirement to dismantle the city gate &quot;Porta a Pisa&quot;. The solution adopted in 1844 was that of Luigi Bettarini which considered the coverage of the &quot;Fosso Reale&quot; with an imposing vault, 240 meters long and 90 meters wide, creating an elliptical paving. The portion of the canal covered by the new structure continued to be navigable.

The new square was commonly called &quot;Piazza del Voltone&quot; until 1850, then &quot;Piazza dei Granduchi&quot; in honour of the Lorraine dynasty until 1859, in the period of the Italian unification was named to &quot;Carlo Alberto&quot; until June 1946 when was given the current name &quot;Piazza della Repubblica&quot;. The square, adorned with 52 marble benches, 92 pillars and two statues dedicated to Ferdinand III by Francesco Pozzi were inaugurated on 8 September 1847 and that dedicated to Leopold II by Paolo Emilio Demi was installed on 6 June 1848. The statue of Leopoldo II was damaged by the crowd on 6 May 1849 and removed from the square because the Emperor was seen as the symbol of the Austrian domination; the statue was placed in &quot;Piazza XX Settembre&quot; in 1957.

====&quot;Terrazza Mascagni&quot;====

The &quot;Terrazza Mascagni&quot; is a wide sinuous belvedere toward the sea with views to the Livorno hills, the Tuscan Archipelago to Corsica, and the Port of Livorno. It is located on the site of the &quot;Forte dei Cavalleggieri&quot; (Cavalrymen Fort) built in the 17th century by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici to deter pirate raids, subsequently replaced by a leisure park in the 1800s, and a heliotherapy centre in the early 1900s. A new parterre, built between 1925 and 1928 by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore, was formed by a series of flower beds and a walkway which follow the outline of the sea with numerous balustrades named after Costanzo Ciano. The &quot;Terrazza&quot; has a paved surface of 8,700 square meters formed by 34,800 black and white tiles placed as a checkerboard and 4,100 balusters. In 1932, a gazebo for musical performances was built in the large square; it was destroyed during World War II. In 1937 the Livorno Aquarium was constructed. After the war, the &quot;Terrazza&quot; was dedicated to Pietro Mascagni and in 1994 it underwent a complete restoration using the same kind of materials originally employed; the works were completed on 10 July 1998 with the reconstruction of the gazebo.

====&quot;Palazzo Comunale&quot;====

Livorno was elevated to the status of city on 19 March 1606 by Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici, the first Gonfaloniere Bernardetto Borromei and the Community representatives held their meetings in the Church of Saint Mary and Saint Julia. On 13 June 1646 a building, placed in &quot;Via del Porticciolo&quot;, was purchased for the sum of seven thousand ducats, in order to accommodate the Community. It was evident that it was inadequate to the task and the Council deliberated, on 27 January 1720, the construction of the new town hall on the project by Giovanni del Fantasia.

The new neo-renaissance palace, positioned between &quot;Palazzo della Dogana&quot; and &quot;Palazzo Granducale&quot; on the north side of &quot;Piazza d’Arme&quot;, was partially destroyed by the 1742 earthquake. Restored in 1745 by Bernardino Ciurini and Antonio Fabbri a double white marble stairway and a small bell tower on the top of the façade were added. In 1867 the complex was enlarged with the acquisition of three other buildings in the back. With the settlement of the Podestà in the fascist period was carried out a new enlargement in 1929 by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore transforming the adjacent former fire station in the council hall. Damaged by the bombing during World War II it was rebuilt and renovated under the direction of Primavera and was inaugurated in 1949 by the mayor Furio Diaz.

===Religious architecture===
====Cathedral of Saint Francis of Assisi====
The cathedral of the town, commonly called Duomo di Livorno, is dedicated to Francis of Assisi, Mary, mother of Jesus, and Julia of Corsica, and was built in a central position of the Pentagono del Buontalenti on the south side of Piazza Grande once named Piazza d’Arme. The original plan was drawn up by Bernardo Buontalenti when he projected the new town. The construction began in June 1581 on a reviewed plan by Alessandro Pieroni under the direction of Antonio Cantagallina. The church had a rectangular plant with a single nave, the original wooden ceiling, executed from 1610 to 1614, was carved by Vincenzo Ricordati and gilded with seven inserted paintings. Jacopo Ligozzi, Domenico Cresti and Jacopo Chimenti decorated, from 1610 to 1614, three large paintings representing &quot;St Francis with Child and the Virgin&quot;, the &quot;Assumption of Mary&quot; and the &quot;Apotheosis of Ste Julia&quot;, the other four paintings were works by minor artists. The simply façade had a marble porch with twin Doric columns surmounted by a terrace added in 1605 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni.

The church was consecrated on 19 February 1606 by Monsignor Nunzio Antonio Grimani; on request by Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, in 1629, was elevated to collegiate church and the &quot;Curato&quot; was substituted from a &quot;Proposto&quot; having the functions of the Vicar of the archbishop of Pisa.
The plant of the church was modified in Christian cross when in 1716 was added the first of two lateral chapels. The left side chapel, dedicated to the Eucharist, was built on a project by Giovanni del Fantasia with frescoes by Giovanni Maria Terreni and the altar attributed to Giovanni Baratta, The right side chapel, dedicated to Immaculate Conception, was built in 1727 and was decorated with paintings by Luigi Ademollo. The Collegiata in 1806 was elevated to cathedral and in 1817 was added the bell tower 50 meters high on project by Gaspero Pampaloni.
The cathedral was completely destroyed in 1943 from the Allied bombardment during World War II; it was then rebuilt respecting the original structure except for the two marble porches added to the transepts and was consecrated on 21 December 1952 by Bishop Giovanni Piccioni.

Since 2006, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Livorno, the &quot;Christ Crowned with Thorns&quot;, by Fra Angelico, was displayed in the Chapel of the Eucharist.

====Church of the Madonna====

The Church of the Madonna is placed on the street of the same name which connects directly the city centre with the district &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; through the John of Nepomuk bridge. According to tradition the church was built to host the statute of Our Lady of Mount Carmel subtracted from a Turkish ship. The church was important as it was a place of worship for foreign communities. Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici gave the church to the Franciscan which had the nearby Oratory of Saints Cosmas and Damian. The construction began on 25 March 1607 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni and was completed in 1611; the church at first was dedicated to Saint Mary, Saint Francis and Saints Cosmas and Damian but in 1638 was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception following enlargement of the building.

The church has a rectangular plan with a single nave and groin vault, on each side, there are the three altars of the foreign Nations. The altar of the French Nation was built in 1613 and the painting, by Matteo Rosselli, represents Saint Louis. The altar of the Corsican Nation, which at the time was under the control of the Republic of Genoa, has a painting representing John the Evangelist. The altar of the Portuguese Nation, built in the 17th century, had a wooden statue of Saint Mary until 1728 when this was positioned near the main altar and replaced by one of Anthony of Padua. The altar of the Dutch-German Nation is dedicated to Andrew the Apostle. Outside the body of the building, separated by a railing, is a Chapel dedicate to the &quot;Madonna di Montenero&quot; built in 1631. The simple façade was covered in white marble in 1972.

====Church of the Most Holy Annunciation====

The Church of the Most Holy Annunciation is located in the central street of &quot;Via della Madonna&quot;, not far from the Armenian community Church of Gregory the Illuminator and the Church of the Madonna. The church is called Unite Greeks too because was the worship place for the Greek community of Byzantine Rite who once lived in Livorno. At the end of the 16th century, numerous Greeks came to Tuscany to take service aboard the galleys of the Order of Saint Stephen. The church was built in 1601 on a project by Alessandro Pieroni, was completed in 1605 and consecrated on 25 March 1606. The baroque façade was built in 1708 presumably on a project by Giovanni Baratta with a triangular pediment and Doric order and was decorated by the statues of Meekness and Innocence by Andrea Vaccà. The interior has a single nave and the ceiling is adorned by a coffer structure with a central painting representing the Annunciation by Giovanni Domenico Ferretti (1750).

===Military architecture===
====&quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot;====

The origin of &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; takes place not far from what once was &quot;Porto Pisano&quot; (Pisan Port) where a square tower was built in 1077, on request of Matilda of Tuscany, on the remains of a Roman tower; in 1241 the Pisans built a massive cylindrical tower, 30 meters high erroneously called &quot;Mastio di Matilde&quot; (Matilda keep). 
 Pisa realized the strategic importance of the castle of Livorno which owned since 1103 and in 1377 the Doge &quot;Gambacorti&quot; of the Republic of Pisa built a quadrangular Fort called &quot;Quadratura dei Pisani&quot; (Quartered of the Pisans) on plans attributed to &quot;Puccio di Landuccio&quot; and &quot;Francesco di Giovanni Giordani&quot;. In 1392 this fort was connected to a wall in order to defend better the town and the &quot;Darsena&quot;. Livorno, in 1405, was sold to Genoa which reinforced the defences, building three forts under the Quartered, afterwards Livorno was bought from Florence on 28 August 1421 at the price of 100.000 Tuscan florin.
The project to build &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; was commissioned to Antonio da Sangallo the Elder in 1506, the fortress had to incorporate the existing Pisan and Genovese constructions.

The works started in 1518 on the order of Cardinal Giulio De&#x27; Medici under the supervision of &quot;Nicolao da Pietrasanta&quot;. The construction was suspended since the popular revolt forced the Medici in exile and was resumed in 1530 on their return. &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; is a massive fortification completed on 1 April 1534 under &quot;Alessandro de&#x27; Medici&quot;; it was built in red-brick with sloping walls and the interposition of clear stones, it has a quadrangular plant with a perimeter of 1500 meters and was equipped with 24 cannons to protect each side. One of the corners directs inside to join the Quartered of the Pisans and Matilda and Genoa keep; the three others are protected by triangular bastions with rounded tips. The bastion towards the north is called &quot;Capitana&quot; because there moored the main Galley, to the east is &quot;Ampolletta&quot; since housed the sand-glass used to control the guard duty, to the west is the &quot;Canaviglia&quot; derived from &quot;Cavaniglia&quot; the name of the commander of the galleys of the Grand Ducky of Tuscany. The land on the side toward the town was excavated in order to have the fortress surrounded by the sea for better defence. &quot;Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici&quot; built in 1544 an imposing palace, overlooking the &quot;Vecchia Darsena&quot;, above the Quartered of the Pisans which went destroyed during World War II. The successor Francesco I de&#x27; Medici built a small palace toward the sea, later became &quot;Porto Mediceo&quot;, on the top of Canaviglia bastion situated at the entrance of &quot;Vecchia Darsena&quot;. On the opposite side was built a church dedicated to Saint Francis where on 19 March 1606 &quot;Ferdinando I de&#x27; Medici&quot; elevated Livorno to the status of city. &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot; changed its function to the coming of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in 1737, by a defensive structure to a military college for officers of the Army of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1769) and afterwards in garrison (1795).

====&quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot;====

The origin of &quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot; (New fortress) took place towards the end of the 1500s, by the adjustment of the &quot;Baluardo San Francesco&quot; (Saint Francis rampart) and the &quot;Baluardo Santa Barbara&quot; (Saint Barbara rampant). The project was commissioned by Cosimo I to Bernardo Buontalenti with the intention to develop a new urban plan of the town that led to a pentagonal shape surrounded by canals.

The original project was then modified by Don Giovanni de&#x27; Medici, Claudio Cogorano and Alessandro Pieroni to allow the construction of the &quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot; in order to strengthen the military apparatus of the town. The works started on 10 January 1590 and ended in 1604, the result is a considerable fortification, in stones and red bricks, with a polygonal plant surrounded by water; the new modification brought to the construction of the &quot;Forte San Pietro&quot; (Saint Peter fort) to defend the &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; quarter.
In 1629 part of the fortress was demolished to permit the building of the &quot;Venezia Nuova&quot; and the &quot;San Marco&quot; quarters that was commissioned by Ferdinando II. 
The &quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot; has been used for military purpose until the end of World War II, inside were built barracks and warehouses and a chapel dedicated to the Immaculate Conception.

The fortress was heavily damaged during World War II with the destruction of most parts of the buildings, the restoration was completed in 1972 and the superior part is used at present as a public park and centre for events and displays.

====&quot;Pentagono del Buontalenti&quot;====

Francesco I de&#x27; Medici gave to Bernardo Buontalenti in 1575 the task to project the ideal town in order to transform Livorno from a fishing village in a fortified town to accommodate 12,000 inhabitants, to include the original settlement and the &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot;, capable to become the trade centre of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The development of the project led to a pentagonal plant as in use in the Renaissance period, each side 600 meters long, with defensive walls, rampant and five bastions at the vertices, surrounded by canals; the fifth bastion coincided with &quot;Fortezza Vecchia&quot;. The plan gave no information regarding the function of the new urban area, indicating only a series of building blocks within a road system absolutely orthogonal, cardo and Decumanus Maximus.
The road axis from north to south (cardo) underline the direction that united the centre of the town with a significant place as the Sanctuary of Montenero; the axis from west to east (decumanus) linked the &quot;Baluardo Santa Giulia&quot; to &quot;Baluardo Sant’Andrea&quot;.
In August 1576 was created the Office of the &quot;Fabbrica di Livorno&quot; with the task of supervising the construction and Alessandro Puccini was the chief superintendent.

Francesco I de&#x27; Medici laid the first stone for the construction of the &quot;Baluardo di San Francesco&quot; (Saint Francis rampant) of the new town on 28 March 1577; the works went on with several changes compared with the original plan including the construction of the &quot;Fortezza Nuova&quot;.
Livorno became a town, encircled by the navigable &quot;Fosso Reale&quot; (Royal canal), with numerous palaces, warehouse, garrisons and custom-houses. The central street at that time was &quot;Via Ferdinanda&quot; extended for 750 meters, later called &quot;Via Grande&quot;, from &quot;Porta Colonnella&quot; (Colonella city gate), in the proximity of &quot;Vecchia Darsena&quot;, to &quot;Porta Pisana&quot; (Pisan city gate). The &quot;Baluardo Sant’Andrea&quot; was initiated in 1578 while the &quot;Baluardo Santa Giulia&quot; started in 1582.

In 1594 it was decided to create a huge square, at halfway of &quot;Via Ferdinanda&quot;, where to build the church of the new town. The church, which was built in a central position on the south side of &quot;Piazza d’Arme&quot;, later &quot;Piazza Grande&quot;, was completed in 1602 under the direction of Antonio Cantagaliina and Alessandro Pieroni. &quot;Piazza d’Arme&quot; was completed and enlarged with the old &quot;Porticciolo dei Genovesi&quot; (Port of Genovesi) filled up with earth to make room to the building called &quot;Tre Palazzi&quot; (Three palaces); the square was adorned with a series of marble arcades attributed to Alessandro Pieroni. 
 The &quot;Palazzo del Picchetto&quot; was built, on plan by Giovanni Battista Foggini and Giovanni del Fantasia in 1707, at the end of &quot;Via Ferdinanda&quot; in the proximity of &quot;Porta Pisana&quot;.

<text>Bannockburn () is an area immediately south of the centre of Stirling in Scotland. It is part of the City of Stirling. It is named after the Bannock Burn, a stream running through the town before flowing into the River Forth.

==History==
Land in the vicinity of Bannockburn town, probably between the Pelstream and Bannock burns (hence Bannockburn), was the site of the Battle of Bannockburn fought in 1314—one of the pivotal battles of the 13th/14th century Wars of Independence between the kingdoms of Scotland and England. A large monument and visitor centre is located near the site of the battle. In previous generations tourists came to visit the site and look at the Borestone. The dignity of the barony of Bannockburn is currently held by Hope Vere Anderson, a descendant of the Sandilands and Vere families of Sandilands and Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire who were the original Barons of Bannockburn in the 14th century. In the year of 1746, after the Battle of Culloden, Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed in Bannockburn House where he met the future mother of his child.

Bannockburn village used to be famous for its carpet and tweed factories and woollen mills. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the Wilson family of Bannockburn designed and wove tartans for the British Army. Many of the so-called Clan tartans were created by the Wilsons in response to the needs of the Clan chiefs who, without their own authentic tartans, approached the Wilsons for suitable patterns. The visit of King George IV to Edinburgh in 1822, and his insistence that the Clan chiefs attend his banquets and levees in their Clan tartans, prompted this reaction. The woollen mills employed 7-800 people around 1880. The last mill closed in 1924.

The turnpike road between Edinburgh and Stirling was constructed in the 1750s and passed through Bannockburn. The route originally passed over the Old Bridge, until the construction in 1819 of a circular-arch stone bridge, built by engineer Thomas Telford, spanning the burn downstream of the battle site. Growth of both Stirling and Bannockburn during the 19th and 20th centuries means that the two now form a contiguous conurbation, and Bannockburn was latterly incorporated into the city (then royal burgh) of Stirling. Bannockburn had a population of 7,352 at the time of the 2001 census.

The area contains most necessary amenities, including a library, and local shops. It is served by Bannockburn Primary School, in the centre of the community, and Bannockburn High School in nearby Broomridge. Several new private housing schemes have been built in and around Bannockburn since the 1990s, increasing pressure on the already overcrowded high school. As a result of this, in 2007 and 2008 Bannockburn High School was extended to provide additional capacity.

Between 1852 and 1949 Bannockburn had a railway station on the Scottish Central Railway, located next to the site of the bus depot. Nowadays, however, residents wishing to use the train must travel into the centre of Stirling. Introduction of a new station with a park-and-ride facility was proposed in the Strategic Transport Projects Review in 2009. Bannockburn is served by the 38, 51 and C30 bus services.

==Sports==

Bannockburn and Hillpark have two amateur football teams, Bannockburn Amateurs (Est. 1968) and Milton FC (Est. 1972). Bannockburn Amateurs won the West of Scotland Amateur Cup for the fifth time in 2019. 

Bannockburn also hosts its own Rugby Club. Formerly known as St Modans HSFP RFC (Est. 1978), it changed its name to Bannockburn RFC in 1996. Bannockburn currently plays in the Scottish Hydro Electric Regional League: Caledonia Division 2 Midlands.

Bannockburn also plays host to St Modans HSFP Cricket Club, who play in the Strathmore and Perthshire Cricket Union Division 1. In July 2013, playing against Perth Doo&#x27;cot CC, St Modans scored 329 runs in response to Perth&#x27;s 326, making it what is believed to be the highest scoring game ever recorded in the SPCU.

Cassel first achieved recognition for his performance as a troubled Jewish youth in Mathieu Kassovitz&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;La Haine (Hate)&quot; for which he received two César Award nominations. He also garnered attention for Gaspar Noé&#x27;s film &quot;Irréversible&quot; (2002) which he acted in and co-produced. He received the César Award for Best Actor for his role as the criminal Jacques Mesrine in &quot;Mesrine&quot; (2008). His other César-nominated roles include &quot;Read My Lips&quot; (2001), &quot;Mon Roi&quot; (2015), &quot;It&#x27;s Only the End of the World&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Specials&quot; (2019).

Cassel garnered recognition with English-speaking roles in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007), &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007), &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), and &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016). In 2020, he appeared on the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Cassel was born in Paris, France, to journalist Sabine Litique and actor Jean-Pierre Cassel (born Jean-Pierre Crochon). Cassel&#x27;s brother, Mathias, is a rapper with the group Assassin under the name &quot;Rockin&#x27; Squat&quot;. His half-sister, Cécile Cassel, is also an actress.

==Career==

=== Early work in France (1990s) ===
One of Cassel&#x27;s first on-screen appearances was a bit part in a 1994 Renault Clio advert which was used in the UK.

Cassel&#x27;s breakthrough role was in Mathieu Kassovitz&#x27;s critically acclaimed film &quot;La Haine&quot; (1995), in which he portrayed a troubled youth living in the deprived outskirts of Paris. For his role in &quot;La Haine&quot;, Cassel was nominated for two César Awards, for Best Actor and Most Promising Actor.

Throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s, Cassel performed in a string of French films. In 1996, he starred opposite Monica Bellucci (before they married) in the moody French film &quot;L&#x27;Appartement.&quot; The film was a critical success, winning a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language and the first British Independent Film Award for the Best Film in a Foreign Language. The film was also a modest hit in France gaining 55,565 admissions its opening weekend and 152,714 admissions total. Although the film was never released theatrically in the United States, it was released on DVD on 22 August 2006.

In 1998, he portrayed Henry, Duc d&#x27;Anjou in &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. In 1999, he portrayed Gilles de Rais in Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.&quot; Other notable roles during this period of his career include the violent film &quot;Dobermann&quot; (1997), the genre-bending &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot; (2001), and the highly controversial &quot;Irréversible&quot; (2002), where he appears fully nude (with Monica Bellucci, after they married).

=== Transition into English films (2000s) ===

Since the early 2000s, Cassel has also appeared in a number of English-language films, such as &quot;Shrek&quot; (as the voice of Monsieur Hood) and &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; (both 2001) &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2004, 2007), and &quot;Derailed&quot; (2005). He has also dubbed the voice of Diego &quot;(Denis Leary)&quot; in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise and Rodney Copperbottom &quot;(Ewan McGregor)&quot; in &quot;Robots&quot;.

In 2007, Cassel attracted significant critical acclaim for his performance in David Cronenberg&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;, in which he starred opposite Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts. The film premiered on 8 September 2007 at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival where it won the Audience Prize for best film on 15 September 2007. &quot;Film Journal International&quot; critic Doris Toumarkine dubbed Cassel&#x27;s performance &quot;particularly delicious&quot;. J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;Cassel literally flings himself into [his role]&quot;.

In October 2008, Cassel was signed to be the face of a new Yves Saint Laurent men&#x27;s fragrance. The new fragrance, &quot;La Nuit de l&#x27;Homme&quot;, was launched worldwide in 2009. Cassel appeared in a two-part film about Jacques Mesrine, who was France&#x27;s &quot;public enemy number one&quot; in the seventies. He won the César Award for Best Actor for his performance as Mesrine. Also that year, he starred in the Portuguese-language, Brazilian film &quot;Adrift (À Deriva)&quot;, and made his debut as a singer on Zap Mama&#x27;s album &quot;ReCreation&quot;, singing alongside them on the singles &quot;Paroles, Paroles&quot; and &quot;Non, Non, Non&quot;.

=== Later work (2010s) ===
The following year, in 2010, Cassel played Thomas Leroy in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010), alongside Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, which attracted considerable acclaim. For his performance in &quot;Black Swan&quot;, he was nominated alongside his cast for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

In 2011, Cassel played the lead role in the French-Spanish thriller-drama film &quot;The Monk&quot;, directed by Dominik Moll. &quot;Screen Daily&quot; praised his performance, writing that &quot;Cassel exudes otherworldly gravitas and his singular looks are perfect for the role.&quot; That year, he also starred in the German-Canadian historical film &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot;, directed by David Cronenberg; in the latter, he starred opposite Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, and Mortensen (marking their second film together). The film premiered at the 68th Venice Film Festival and was also featured at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2014, he portrayed The Beast opposite Léa Seydoux as Belle in the French-language adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. The film was screened out of competition at the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. It was released in France on in February 2014 to positive reviews, becoming a box office success. In Japan, the film topped the box office on its release, making it the first non-English-language foreign film to top the Japanese box office since &quot;Red Cliff II&quot; in 2009, and the first French film to top the Japanese box office since Mathieu Kassovitz&#x27;s &quot;The Crimson Rivers&quot; in 2001.

In 2016, Cassel was featured in American action thriller film &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, directed by Paul Greengrass; the film is the fifth installment of the &quot;Bourne&quot; film series and a direct sequel to &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007). Despite mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing more than $400 million worldwide. That year, he also attracted critical acclaim for his performance as Antoine in Xavier Dolan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Only the End of the World&quot;, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. For his work in the film, Cassel won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor; he also received nominations for the César Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Globes de Cristal Award for Best Actor, and the Jury Prize for Best Actor at the Riviera International Film Festival.

In 2019, Cassel played the lead role in &quot;The Specials&quot; directed by Éric Toledano and Olivier Nakache based on the true story of Stephane Benhamou who ran an organization helping people with autism find employment and activities outside the confines of the institutionalized setting. It was screened out of competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and Cassel was nominated for the César Award for Best Actor.

=== Recent work (2020s) ===
In 2020, he portrayed trillionaire Engerrand Serac, the main antagonist of the third season of the HBO series &quot;Westworld&quot;.

In 2021, he narrated the documentary &quot;Reset&quot;, directed by Thierry Donard.

In 2023, he starred in the Apple TV+ spy thriller series &quot;&quot;Liaison&quot;&quot; with Eva Green. In November the same year, he was revealed as the voice actor for United Nations&#x27; French agent Victor Chevalier in the upcoming 2024 video game &quot;Tekken 8&quot;, making it his first role in a video game. Vincent first came to know &quot;Tekken&quot; back in the 1990s, with his favorite character being Eddy Gordo.

==Personal life==

Cassel met Italian actress Monica Bellucci on the set of their 1996 film &quot;The Apartment&quot;. They married on 2 August 1999 in Monaco. They have two daughters, Deva (born 12 September 2004) and Léonie (born 21 May 2010). Cassel and Bellucci announced their separation on 26 August 2013. Bellucci filed for divorce the same year. They later divorced. At the age of 15, Deva was Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#x27;s muse to embody their Dolce Shine perfume and later became their runway model.

He married 21-year-old French model on 24 August 2018 in Bidart, France, after being in a relationship for more than two years. They have a daughter, Amazonie (born 19 April 2019). Cassel and Kunakey separated in 2023.

On October 20, 2023, media outlets revealed that Cassel is in a relationship with Brazilian model Narah Baptista, who is twenty-nine years younger than him, six months after separating from his second wife of five years, Tina Kunakey. On January 7, 2025, he welcomed the birth of his fourth and Baptista&#x27;s first child, a son named Caetano.

Besides his native French, Cassel speaks English, Portuguese, Italian, and basic conversational Russian, which he learned for his role in &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;. Cassel lived in Rio de Janeiro for five years, before moving back to Paris in 2018, and he used to have Brazilian citizenship. Cassel is known for having a great identification with Brazil, being a practitioner of the martial art of capoeira; he displayed this talent in the movie &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot;.

Cassel went to different schools, including a Catholic school, eventually becoming irreligious. He opened up about his religious views in an interview, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m totally secular myself, and I have a tremendous respect for life. Which means that I essentially believe in God in a certain sense, but I&#x27;m not a Catholic or Jewish or Muslim. I&#x27;m without a religion.&quot;

His father, Jean-Pierre Cassel, died of cancer on 19 April 2007 at age 74.

<doc id="246311" wikidata="Q15863" url="?curid=246311" title="Slovenes">
<text>The Slovenes, also known as Slovenians ( ), are a South Slavic ethnic group native to Slovenia, and adjacent regions in Italy, Austria and Hungary. Slovenes share a common ancestry, culture, history and speak Slovene as their native language. According to ethnic classification based on language, they are closely related to other South Slavic ethnic groups, as well as more distantly to West Slavs.

Outside of Slovenia and Europe, Slovenes form diaspora groups in the United States, Canada, Argentina and Brazil.

==Population==

===Population in Slovenia===
Most Slovenes today live within the borders of the independent Slovenia (2,100,000 inhabitants, 83% Slovenes est. July 2020). In the Slovenian national census of 2002, 1,631,363 people ethnically declared themselves as Slovenes, while 1,723,434 people claimed Slovene as their native language.

===Population abroad===
The autochthonous Slovene minority in Italy is estimated at 83,000 to 100,000, the Slovene minority in southern Austria at 24,855, in Croatia at 13,200, and in Hungary at 3,180.
Significant Slovene expatriate communities live in the United States and Canada, in other European countries, in South America (mostly in Argentina and Brazil), and in Australia and New Zealand. The largest population of Slovenes outside of Slovenia is in Cleveland.

==Genetics==
In a 2013 Y-DNA study, 29-32% of 399–458 sampled Slovenian males belong to Y-DNA Haplogroup R1a, more frequent than in South Slavic peoples. The second largest Haplogroup was the Haplogroup R1b, which was at 26-28%, following was the Haplogroup I, with 30-31%. Due to the geographic position of Slovenia, the population is substantially diverse, sharing genes with Italic peoples, Germanic, Slavs and Hungarians. The Slovenian population displays close genetic affiliations with West Slavic, South Slavic, Austrians and Italic populations. The homogenous genetic strata of the West Slavic populations and the Slovenian population suggest the existence of a common ancestral population in the central European region. The R-Z92 branch of R-Z280 which is significant among East Slavs is recorded as completely absent among Slovenes. In 2016 study, including 100 sampled Slovenians, 27.1% belong to R1b, of which 11.03% of R1b belongs to the R-P312 branch, 6% to the eastern and 4% to R-U106. In the 2018 autosomal analysis of Slovenian population, the Slovenes clustered with Hungarians and were close to Czechs.

==History==

===Early Alpine Slavs===

In the 6th century AD, Slavic people settled the region between the Alps and the Adriatic Sea in two consecutive migration waves: the first wave came from the Moravian lands around 550,
while the second wave, coming from the southeast, moved into the area after the migration of the Lombards to Italy in 568.

From 623 to 658 Slavic peoples between the upper Elbe River and the Karawanks mountain range united under the leadership of King Samo () in what became known as &quot;Samo&#x27;s Tribal Union&quot;. The tribal union collapsed after Samo&#x27;s death in 658, but a smaller Slavic tribal principality, Carantania (Slovene: &quot;Karantanija&quot;), remained, with its centre in the present-day region of Carinthia.

===Alpine Slavs during the Frankish Empire===
Faced with the pressing danger of Avar tribes from the east, the Carantanians accepted a union with Bavaria in 745, and later in the 8th century recognized Frankish rule and accepted Christianity. The last Slavic state formation in the region, the principality of Prince Kocel, lost its independence in 874. Slovene ethnic territory subsequently shrank due to pressure from Germans from the west and the arrival of Hungarians in the Pannonian plain; it stabilized in its present form in the 15th century.

===16th century: Slovene Protestant reformation and consolidation of Slovene===
The first mentions of a common Slovene ethnic identity, transcending regional boundaries, date from the 16th century. During this period, the first books in Slovene were written by the Protestant preacher Primož Trubar and his followers, establishing the base for the development of standard Slovene. In the second half of the 16th century, numerous books were printed in Slovene, including an integral translation of the Bible by Jurij Dalmatin.

At the beginning of the 17th century, Protestantism was suppressed by the Habsburg-sponsored Counter Reformation, which introduced the new aesthetics of Baroque culture.

===18th century: Slovenes under Maria Theresa and Joseph II===
The Enlightenment in the Habsburg monarchy brought significant social and cultural progress to the Slovene people. It hastened economic development and facilitated the appearance of a middle class. Under the reign of Maria Theresa and Emperor Joseph II (1765–1790) many reforms were undertaken in the administration and society, including land reforms, the modernization of the Church and compulsory primary education in Slovene (1774). The start of cultural-linguistic activities by Slovene intellectuals of the time brought about a national revival and the birth of the Slovene nation in the modern sense of the word. Before the Napoleonic Wars, some secular literature in Slovene emerged. During the same period, the first history of the Slovene Lands as an ethnic unity was written by Anton Tomaž Linhart, while Jernej Kopitar compiled the first comprehensive grammar of Slovene.

===Slovenes under Napoleon (1809–1813)===
Between 1809 and 1813, Slovenia was part of the Illyrian Provinces, an autonomous province of the Napoleonic French Empire, with Ljubljana as the capital. Although the French rule was short-lived, it significantly contributed to the rise of national consciousness and political awareness of Slovenes. After the fall of Napoleon, all Slovene Lands were once again included in the Austrian Empire. Gradually, a distinct Slovene national consciousness developed, and the quest for a political unification of all Slovenes became widespread. In the 1820s and 1840s, the interest in Slovene language and folklore grew enormously, with numerous philologists advancing the first steps towards standardization of the language. Illyrian movement, Pan-Slavic and Austro-Slavic ideas gained importance. However, the intellectual circle around the philologist Matija Čop and the Romantic poet France Prešeren was influential in affirming the idea of Slovene linguistic and cultural individuality, refusing the idea of merging Slovenes into a wider Slavic nation.

===1840s: the first Slovene national political programme===

In the 1840s, the Slovene national movement developed far beyond literary expression. In 1848, the first Slovene national political programme, called &quot;United Slovenia&quot; (), was written in the context of the Spring of Nations movement within the Austrian Empire. It demanded a unification of all Slovene-speaking territories in an autonomous kingdom, named &quot;Slovenija&quot;, within the empire and an official status for Slovene. Although the project failed, it served as an important platform of Slovene political activity in the following decades, particularly in the 1860s and 1870s, when mass Slovene rallies, named &quot;tabori&quot;, were organised. The conflict between Slovene and German nationalists deepened. In 1866, some Slovenes were left to Italy, and in 1867 some remained in the Hungarian part of the Austria-Hungary. This significantly affected the nation and led to further radicalisation of the Slovene national movement. In the 1890s, the first Slovene political parties were established. All of them were loyal to Austria, but they were also espousing a common South Slavic cause.

===Emigration===
Between 1880 and World War I, the largest numbers of Slovenes emigrated to America. Most of these went between 1905 and 1913, although the exact number is impossible to determine because Slovenes were often classified as Austrians, Italians, Croats, or under other, broader labels, such as Slavonic or Slavic. Those who settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania came to be called &quot;Windish&quot;, from the Austrian German term &quot;Windisch&quot; &#x27;Wend&#x27;.

The largest group of Slovenes in the United States eventually settled in Cleveland, Ohio, and the surrounding area. The second-largest group settled in Chicago, principally on the Lower West Side. The American Slovenian Catholic Union (Ameriško slovenska katoliška enota) was founded as an organization to protect Slovene-American rights in Joliet, Illinois, southwest of Chicago, and in Cleveland. Today there are KSKJ branches all over the country offering life insurance and other services to Slovene-Americans. Freethinkers were centered around 18th and Racine Ave. in Chicago, where they founded the Slovene National Benefit Society; other Slovene immigrants went to southwestern Pennsylvania, southeastern Ohio and the state of West Virginia to work in the coal mines and lumber industry. Some Slovenes also went to the Pittsburgh or Youngstown, Ohio, areas, to work in the steel mills, as well as Minnesota&#x27;s Iron Range, to work in the iron mines and also to Copper Country on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan for copper mining. Many also went west to Rock Springs in Wyoming to work in the coal mines that supported the Union Pacific Railway.

===World War I===

There were more than 30,000 casualties among ethnic Slovenes during World War I because they were and still are inhabiting the territory where the Isonzo Front was fought. While the majority of them were drafted in the Austro-Hungarian Army, also Slovene civil inhabitants from the Gorizia and Gradisca region suffered in hundreds of thousands because they were resettled in refugee camps where, however, Slovene refugees were treated as state enemies by Italians and several thousands died of malnutrition in Italian refugee camps.

===Fascist Italianization of Littoral Slovenes===



The annexed western quarter of Slovene speaking territory, and approximately 327,000 out of the total population of 1.3 million Slovenes, were subjected to forced Fascist Italianization. On the map of present-day Slovenia with its traditional regions&#x27; boundaries.

After the First World War (1914–1918), the majority of Slovenes joined other South Slavs in the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, followed by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and finally the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In the new system of banovinas (since 1929), Slovenes formed a majority in the Drava Banovina.

In the ex-Austrian Empire area given to Italy in exchange for joining Great Britain in World War I, the forced Fascist Italianization of Slovene minority in Italy (1920–1947) was under no international restraint especially after Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922. Already during the period of Italian occupation, between the years 1918 and 1920, all Slovene cultural associations (Sokol, &quot;reading rooms&quot; etc.) had been forbidden. Fascist Italy brought Italian teachers from southern Italy to Italianize ethnic Slovene and Croatian children, while the Slovene and Croatian teachers, poets, writers, artists and clergy were exiled to Sardinia and elsewhere to southern Italy. In 1926, claiming that it was restoring surnames to their original Italian form, the Italian government announced the Italianization of names and surnames not only of citizens of the Slovene minority, but also of Croatian and German. Some Slovenes willingly accepted Italianization in order to lose the status of being second-class citizens with no upward social mobility. By the mid-1930s, around 70,000 Slovenes had fled the region, mostly to Yugoslavia and South America.

In the bilingual regions people of Carinthia decided in a 1920 referendum that most of Carinthia should remain in Austria.

Slovene volunteers also participated in the Spanish Civil War and the Second Italo-Abyssinian War.

===World War II and aftermath===



During WWII, Nazi Germany and Hungary occupied northern areas (brown and dark green areas, respectively), while Fascist Italy occupied the vertically hashed black area, including Gottschee area (solid black western part being annexed by Italy already with the Treaty of Rapallo). After 1943, Germany took over the Italian occupational area, as well.

During World War II, Slovenes were in a unique situation. While Greece shared its experience of being trisected, Slovenia was the only country that experienced a further step—absorption and annexation into neighboring Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Hungary. After Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis Powers on 6 April 1941, Germany and Hungary occupied northern Slovenia. Some villages in Lower Carniola were annexed by the Independent State of Croatia.

The Nazis started a policy of violent Germanisation. During the war, tens of thousands of Slovenes were resettled or chased away, imprisoned, or transported to labor, internment and extermination camps. Many were sent into exile to Nedić&#x27;s Serbia and Croatia. The numbers of Slovenes drafted to the German military and paramilitary formations has been estimated at 150,000 men and women, almost a quarter of them died on various European battlefields, mostly on the Eastern Front.

Compared to the German policies in the northern Nazi-occupied area of Slovenia and the forced Fascist italianization in the former Austrian Littoral that was annexed after the First World War, the initial Italian policy in the central Slovenia was not as violent. Tens of thousands of Slovenes from German-occupied Lower Styria and Upper Carniola escaped to the Province of Ljubljana until June 1941.

However, after resistance started in Province of Ljubljana, Italian violence against the Slovene civil population easily matched that of the Germans. The province saw the deportation of 25,000 people—which equated to 7.5% of the total population of the province—in one of the most drastic operations in Europe that filled up many Italian concentration camps, such as Rab concentration camp, in Gonars concentration camp, Monigo (Treviso), Renicci d&#x27;Anghiari, Chiesanuova (Padua) and elsewhere. To suppress the mounting resistance by the Slovene Partisans, Mario Roatta adopted draconian measures of summary executions, hostage-taking, reprisals, internments, and the burning of houses and whole villages. The &quot;3C&quot; pamphlet, tantamount to a declaration of war on civilians, involved him in Italian war crimes.

In the summer of 1941, a resistance movement led by the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation, emerged in both the Italian and in the German occupation zones. The resistance, pluralistic at the beginning, was gradually taken over by the Communist Party, as in the rest of occupied Yugoslavia. Contrary to elsewhere in Yugoslavia, where on the freed territories the political life was organized by the military itself, the Slovene Partisans were subordinated to the civil political authority of the Front.

In the summer of 1942, a civil war between Slovenes broke out. The two fighting factions were the Slovenian Partisans and the Italian-sponsored anti-communist militia, later re-organized under Nazi command as the Slovene Home Guard. Small units of Slovenian Chetniks also existed in Lower Carniola and Styria. The Partisans were under the command of the Liberation Front (OF) and Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav resistance, while the Slovenian Covenant served as the political arm of the anti-Communist militia. The civil war was mostly restricted to the Province of Ljubljana, where more than 80% of the Slovene anti-partisan units were active. Between 1943 and 1945, smaller anti-Communist militia existed in parts of the Slovenian Littoral and in Upper Carniola, while they were virtually non-existent in the rest of the country. By 1945, the total number of Slovene anti-Communist militiamen reached 17,500.

Immediately after the war, some 12,000 members of the Slovene Home Guard were killed in the Kočevski Rog massacres, while thousands of anti-communist civilians were killed in the first year after the war. In addition, hundreds of ethnic Italians from the Julian March were killed by the Yugoslav Army and partisan forces in the Foibe massacres; some 27,000 Istrian Italians fled Slovenian Istria from Communist persecution in the so-called Istrian–Dalmatian exodus. Members of the ethnic German minority either fled or were expelled from Slovenia.

The overall number of World War II casualties in Slovenia is estimated at 97,000. The number includes about 14,000 people, who were killed or died for other war-related reasons immediately after the end of the war, and the tiny Jewish community, which was nearly annihilated in the Holocaust. In addition, tens of thousands of Slovenes left their homeland soon after the end of the war. Most of them settled in Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

Most of Carinthia remained part of Austria and around 42,000 Slovenes (per 1951 population census) were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. Slovenes in the Austrian state of Styria (4,250) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of 27 July 1955 states otherwise. Many Carinthians remain uneasy about Slovene territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars. The former governor, Jörg Haider, regularly played the Slovene card when his popularity started to dwindle, and indeed relied on the strong anti-Slovene attitudes in many parts of the province for his power base.

Yugoslavia acquired some territory from Italy after WWII but some 100,000 Slovenes remained behind the Italian border, notably around Trieste and Gorizia.

==Slovenes in Socialist Yugoslavia==

Following the re-establishment of Yugoslavia at the end of World War II, Slovenia became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, declared on 29 November 1943. A socialist state was established, but because of the Tito–Stalin split, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the Eastern Bloc. In 1947, Italy ceded most of the Julian March to Yugoslavia, and Slovenia thus regained the Slovene Littoral.

The dispute over the port of Trieste however remained opened until 1954, until the short-lived Free Territory of Trieste was divided between Italy and Yugoslavia, thus giving Slovenia access to the sea. This division was ratified only in 1975 with the Treaty of Osimo, which gave a final legal sanction to Slovenia&#x27;s long disputed western border. From the 1950s, the Socialist Republic of Slovenia exercised relatively wide autonomy.

===The Stalinist period===
Between 1945 and 1948, a wave of political repressions took place in Slovenia and in Yugoslavia. Thousands of people were imprisoned for their political beliefs. Several tens of thousands of Slovenes left Slovenia immediately after the war in fear of Communist persecution. Many of them settled in Brazil and Argentina, which became the core of Slovenian anti-Communist emigration. More than 50,000 more followed in the next decade, frequently for economic reasons, as well as political ones. These later waves of Slovene immigrants mostly settled in Canada and in Australia, but also in other western countries.

Additionally, due to the removal of German Yugoslavs (which included in many cases ethnic Slovenes of partial German or Austrian heritage) from Yugoslavia under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, many citizens were interned in concentration and work camps or forcibly expelled from the country in the years that followed WWII. As a result, a large number of German and Austrian Slovenes emigrated to Italy, Austria, Croatia, Hungary, and other European countries. Most who settled in Hungary during this period fled or were expelled to Germany and Austria in turn. Many expatriates ultimately settled in the Cleveland metropolitan area in the United States; the high concentration of Slovenes in Cleveland specifically is attributed to the industrial opportunities at the time, as well as the existing workforce in the area being largely of Germanic and Slavic descent. Many Slovene expats during this period were sponsored to work in the United States by wealthy Slovenes or Slovene community organizations within the Greater Cleveland area, which greatly contributed to the large Slovene population in the city.

===The 1948 Tito–Stalin split and aftermath===

In 1948, the Tito–Stalin split took place. In the first years following the split, the political repression worsened, as it extended to Communists accused of Stalinism. Hundreds of Slovenes were imprisoned in the concentration camp of Goli Otok, together with thousands of people of other nationalities. Among the show trials that took place in Slovenia between 1945 and 1950, the most important were the Nagode trial against democratic intellectuals and left liberal activists (1946) and the Dachau trials (1947–1949), where former inmates of Nazi concentration camps were accused of collaboration with the Nazis. Many members of the Roman Catholic clergy suffered persecution. The case of bishop of Ljubljana Anton Vovk, who was doused with gasoline and set on fire by Communist activists during a pastoral visit to Novo Mesto in January 1952, echoed in the western press.
Between 1949 and 1953, a forced collectivization was attempted. After its failure, a policy of gradual liberalization followed.

===1950s: heavy industrialization===
In the late 1950s, Slovenia was the first of the Yugoslav republics to begin a process of relative pluralization. A decade of industrialisation was accompanied also by a fervent cultural and literary production with many tensions between the government and the dissident intellectuals. From the late 1950s onward, dissident circles started to be formed, mostly around short-lived independent journals, such as &quot;Revija 57&quot; (1957–1958), which was the first independent intellectual journal in Yugoslavia and one of the first of this kind in the Communist bloc, and &quot;Perspektive&quot; (1960–1964). Among the most important critical public intellectuals in this period were the sociologist Jože Pučnik, the poet Edvard Kocbek, and the literary historian Dušan Pirjevec.

===1960s: self-management===
By the late 1960s, the reformist faction gained control of the Slovenian Communist Party, launching a series of reforms, aiming at the modernization of Slovenian society and economy. A new economic policy, known as workers self-management started to be implemented under the advice and supervision of the main champion of the Yugoslav Communist Party, Slovene Edvard Kardelj.

===1970s: years of Lead===
In 1973, the reformist trend was stopped by the conservative faction of the Slovenian Communist Party as part of a general reining in of liberal tendencies by the Yugoslav communist authorities. A period known as the &quot;Years of Lead&quot; (Slovene: &quot;svinčena leta&quot;) followed.

===1980s: towards independence===
In the 1980s, Slovenia experienced a rise in cultural pluralism. Numerous grass-roots political, artistic and intellectual movements emerged, including the Neue Slowenische Kunst, the Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis, and the &quot;Nova revija&quot; intellectual circle. By the mid-1980s, a reformist fraction, led by Milan Kučan, took control of the Slovenian Communist Party, starting a gradual reform towards market socialism and controlled political pluralism.

==Slovenes in independent Slovenia==

===1990s: Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence===
The first clear demand for Slovene independence was made in 1987 by a group of intellectuals in the 57th edition of the magazine &quot;Nova revija&quot;. Demands for democratisation and increase of Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.
In 1991, Slovenia became an independent nation state after a brief ten-day war. In December 1991, a new constitution was adopted, followed in 1992 by the laws on denationalisation and privatization. The members of the European Union recognised Slovenia as an independent state on 15 January 1992, and the United Nations accepted it as a member on 22 May 1992.

===2010s: Slovenian disillusionment with socio-economic elites===
The disillusionment with domestic socio-economic elites at municipal and the State&#x27;s level was expressed at the 2012–2013 Slovenian protests on a wider scale than in the smaller 15 October 2011 protests – Slovenian disillusionment with the elites and financial institutions at the European and global level. In relation to the leading politicians&#x27; response to allegations made by official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, law experts expressed the need for changes in the system that would limit political arbitrariness.

==Identity==

Based on a German name for the Slovenes, &quot;Wenden&quot; or &quot;Winden&quot;, the first researchers of the origin of the Slovenes mistakenly believed that they were descendants of the Germanic tribe of the Vandals. Even today, some German speakers refer to the Slovenian minority in Carinthian Austria as &quot;Windische&quot;, as if a separate ethnicity. This claim is rejected by linguists on the basis that their dialect is by all standards a variant of Slovene. The first to define Slovenes as a separate branch of the Slavic people was Anton Tomaž Linhart in his work &quot;An Essay on the History of Carniola and Other Lands of the Austrian South Slavs&quot;, published in 1791. In it, Linhart also established the linguistic unity of the Slovene ethnic territory and set the foundations of the Slovene ethnography.

After the disintegration of Yugoslavia during the late 1980s and the formation of independent Slovenia in the early 1990s motivated interest in a particularly Slovenian national identity. One reflection of this was an attempt at the rejection of a Slavic identity in favour of a &quot;Venetic&quot; one. The autochthonist &quot;Venetic theory&quot; was advanced in the mid 1980s, but it never gained wide currency. The identification with Slavic roots remains strong in Slovenia and in 2004 even led to the establishment of the Forum of Slavic Cultures in Ljubljana.

In the late 1980s, several symbols from the Middle Ages were revived as Slovenian national symbols. Among them, the most popular are the so-called Slovene Hat which featured in the coat of arms of the Slovene March, and the Black Panther, a reconstruction of the supposed coat of arms of the Carolingian duchy of Carantania. After being used in the Flag of Slovenia, the graphical representation of Triglav has become recognised as a national symbol. Per the Constitution of Slovenia and the Slovenian act on national symbols, the flag of the Slovene nation is a white-blue-red flag without the coat-of-arms. The ratio of the width to height of the flag is one to two.

===Language===
Freising manuscripts are the first written words in Slovene. Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved. They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovenian dialect. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form.
Primož Trubar (1508–1586) is the author of the first printed book in Slovene. He was a Slovenian Protestant Reformer of the Lutheran tradition.

===Religion===
Most ethnic Slovenes are Roman Catholic by faith, with some historical Protestant minorities, especially Lutherans in Prekmurje. A sizable minority of Slovenes are non-religious or atheists, according to the published data from the 2002 Slovenian census, out of a total of 47,488 Muslims (who represent 2.4% of the total population), 2,804 Muslims (who in turn represent 5.9% of the total Muslims in Slovenia) declared themselves as Slovenian Muslims.

<doc id="246320" wikidata="Q5532500" url="?curid=246320" title="Generalized permutation matrix">
<text>In mathematics, a generalized permutation matrix (or monomial matrix) is a matrix with the same nonzero pattern as a permutation matrix, i.e. there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column. Unlike a permutation matrix, where the nonzero entry must be 1, in a generalized permutation matrix the nonzero entry can be any nonzero value. An example of a generalized permutation matrix is

:formula_1

== Structure ==
An invertible matrix &quot;A&quot; is a generalized permutation matrix if and only if it can be written as a product of an invertible diagonal matrix &quot;D&quot; and an (implicitly invertible) permutation matrix &quot;P&quot;: i.e.,

:formula_2

===Group structure===
The set of &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; generalized permutation matrices with entries in a field &quot;F&quot; forms a subgroup of the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;), in which the group of nonsingular diagonal matrices Δ(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) forms a normal subgroup. Indeed, over all fields except GF(2), the generalized permutation matrices are the normalizer of the diagonal matrices, meaning that the generalized permutation matrices are the &quot;largest&quot; subgroup of GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) in which diagonal matrices are normal.

The abstract group of generalized permutation matrices is the wreath product of &quot;F&quot;× and &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;. Concretely, this means that it is the semidirect product of Δ(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) by the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;:
:&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; ⋉ Δ(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;),
where &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; acts by permuting coordinates and the diagonal matrices Δ(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) are isomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-fold product (&quot;F&quot;×)&quot;n&quot;.

To be precise, the generalized permutation matrices are a (faithful) linear representation of this abstract wreath product: a realization of the abstract group as a subgroup of matrices.

===Subgroups===
* The subgroup where all entries are 1 is exactly the permutation matrices, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group.
* The subgroup where all entries are ±1 is the signed permutation matrices, which is the hyperoctahedral group.
* The subgroup where the entries are &quot;m&quot;th roots of unity formula_3 is isomorphic to a generalized symmetric group.
* The subgroup of diagonal matrices is abelian, normal, and a maximal abelian subgroup. The quotient group is the symmetric group, and this construction is in fact the Weyl group of the general linear group: the diagonal matrices are a maximal torus in the general linear group (and are their own centralizer), the generalized permutation matrices are the normalizer of this torus, and the quotient, formula_4 is the Weyl group.

== Properties ==
* If a nonsingular matrix and its inverse are both nonnegative matrices (i.e. matrices with nonnegative entries), then the matrix is a generalized permutation matrix.
* The determinant of a generalized permutation matrix is given by formula_5 where formula_6 is the sign of the permutation formula_7 associated with formula_8 and formula_9 are the diagonal elements of formula_10.

== Generalizations ==
One can generalize further by allowing the entries to lie in a ring, rather than in a field. In that case if the non-zero entries are required to be units in the ring, one again obtains a group. On the other hand, if the non-zero entries are only required to be non-zero, but not necessarily invertible, this set of matrices forms a semigroup instead.

One may also schematically allow the non-zero entries to lie in a group &quot;G,&quot; with the understanding that matrix multiplication will only involve multiplying a single pair of group elements, not &quot;adding&quot; group elements. This is an abuse of notation, since element of matrices being multiplied must allow multiplication and addition, but is suggestive notion for the (formally correct) abstract group formula_11 (the wreath product of the group &quot;G&quot; by the symmetric group).

==Signed permutation group==

A signed permutation matrix is a generalized permutation matrix whose nonzero entries are ±1, and are the integer generalized permutation matrices with integer inverse.

===Properties===
* It is the Coxeter group formula_12, and has order formula_13.
* It is the symmetry group of the hypercube and (dually) of the cross-polytope.
* Its index 2 subgroup of matrices with determinant equal to their underlying (unsigned) permutation is the Coxeter group formula_14 and is the symmetry group of the demihypercube.
* It is a subgroup of the orthogonal group.

==Applications==

===Monomial representations===

Monomial matrices occur in representation theory in the context of monomial representations. A monomial representation of a group &quot;G&quot; is a linear representation of &quot;G&quot; (here &quot;F&quot; is the defining field of the representation) such that the image &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is a subgroup of the group of monomial matrices.

<text>The Philippine Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean east of the Philippine Archipelago (hence the name) and the largest sea in the world, occupying an estimated surface area of . The Philippine Sea Plate forms the floor of the sea. Its western border is the first island chain to the west, comprising the Ryukyu Islands in the northwest and Taiwan in the west. Its southwestern border comprises the Philippine islands of Luzon, Catanduanes, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Its northern border comprises the Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyūshū. Its eastern border is the second island chain to the east, comprising the Bonin Islands and Iwo Jima in the northeast, the Mariana Islands (including Guam, Saipan, and Tinian) in the due east, and Halmahera, Palau, Yap and Ulithi (of the Caroline Islands) in the southeast. Its southern border is Indonesia&#x27;s Morotai Island.

The sea has a complex and diverse undersea relief. The floor is formed into a structural basin by a series of geologic faults and fracture zones. Island arcs, which are actually extended ridges protruding above the ocean surface due to plate tectonic activity in the area, enclose the Philippine Sea to the north, east and south. The Philippine archipelago, Ryukyu Islands, and the Marianas are examples. Another prominent feature of the Philippine Sea is the presence of deep sea trenches, among them the Philippine Trench and the Mariana Trench, containing the deepest point on the planet.

==Geography==
===Location===

The Philippine Sea has the Philippines and Taiwan to the west, Japan to the north, the Marianas to the east and Palau to the south. Adjacent seas include the Celebes Sea which is separated by Mindanao and smaller islands to the south, the South China Sea which is separated by Philippines, and the East China Sea which is separated by the Ryukyu Islands.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Philippine Sea as &quot;that area of the North Pacific Ocean off the Eastern coasts of the Philippine Islands&quot;, bounded as follows:

&quot;On the west.&quot; By the eastern limits of the East Indian Archipelago, South China Sea and East China Sea.

&quot;On the north.&quot; By the southeast coast of Kyushu, the southern and eastern limits of the Inland Sea and the south coast of Honshu Island.

&quot;On the east.&quot;
By the ridge joining Japan to the Bonin, Volcano and Ladrone (Mariana) Islands, all these being included in the Philippine Sea.

&quot;On the south.&quot; By a line joining Guam, Yap, Pelew (Palau) and Halmahera Islands.


===Geology===

The Philippine Sea Plate forms the floor of the Philippine Sea. It subducts under the Philippine Mobile Belt which carries most of the Philippine archipelago and eastern Taiwan. Between the two plates is the Philippine Trench.

===Marine biodiversity===
The Philippine Sea has a marine territorial scope of over , and an EEZ of 2.2 million km2. Attributed to an extensive vicariance and island integrations, the Philippines contains the highest number of marine species per unit area relative to the countries within the Indo-Malay-Philippines Archipelago, and has been identified as the epicenter of marine biodiversity. With its inclusion in the Coral Triangle, the Philippine Sea encompasses over 3,212 fish species, 486 coral species, 800 seaweed species, and 820 benthic algae species, wherein the Verde Island Passage is dubbed as &quot;the center of the center of marine fish biodiversity&quot;. Within its territory, thirty-three endemic species of fish have been identified, including the blue-spotted angelfish (Chaetodontoplus caeruleopunctatus) and the sea catfish (Arius manillensis). The Philippine marine territory has also become a breeding and feeding ground for endangered marine species, such as the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), the dugong (Dugong dugon), and the megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios). Within the South China Sea, Philippine scientists have discovered an abundant amount of marine life and species that have the potential to be biomedical advances for the Philippines as well.

===Coral Triangle===
The Coral Triangle (also called the Indo-Malayan Triangle) is considered to be the global center of marine biodiversity. Its total oceanic area is approximately 2 million square kilometers. It encompasses the tropical waters of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands. The Philippine islands, which lie at its apex, make up of it. The part of the Coral Triangle&#x27;s coral reef area that lies within the Philippines ranges from to . It contains over 500 species of scleractinian or stony corals, and at least 12 endemic coral species.

The Coral Triangle contains 75% of the world&#x27;s coral species (around 600 species). It is home to over 2000 types of reef fish, and six of the world&#x27;s seven species of marine turtles (the hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback, green turtle, olive ridley, and sea turtle). There is no single causal explanation for the unusually high biodiversity found in the Coral Triangle, but most researchers have attributed it to geological factors such as plate tectonics.

The Philippine Sea provides or supports the livelihoods of 120 million people, and is a source of food for the Philippine coastal communities and for millions more people worldwide. Whale-shark tourism in the Coral Triangle also provides a steady source of income for the surrounding community. The marine resources in the Coral Triangle have a high economic value, not only in the Philippines, but across the globe. The countries surrounding the Coral Triangle work to provide their people with technical assistance and other resources needed to promote conservation, sustainability, biodiversity, food security, sources of livelihood, and economic development.

Climate change is affecting the coastal ecosystem found in the Coral Triangle. It is contributing to rising sea levels and ocean acidification, thus endangering marine animals like fish and turtles. This has a negative effect on local sources of livelihood, such as fishing and tourism. It is also making the waters warmer, which endangers corals. Warmer water causes corals to absorb more carbon dioxide. This alters the water&#x27;s pH balance, making it acidic, a condition to which the corals are not adapted, and in which they are ill-equipped to survive.

==Biology==

The Philippine Sea hosts an exotic marine ecosystem. There are 421 of the 577 known species of corals in coastal waters, including 19 seagrass species and 30 species of mangrove, both of which contribute nutrients to coral systems. The Philippines also consists of 20 percent of the shellfish globally. Sea turtles, sharks, moray eels, octopuses, and sea snakes, along with numerous species of fish such as tuna can commonly be observed. Additionally, the Philippine Sea serves as spawning ground for Japanese eel, tuna, and different whale species.


===Biodiversity===
The Philippine Sea is a centre of marine biodiversity as well as a biodiversity hotspot. However, at least 418 species are being threatened because of unsustainable practices.

The rise in temperature change caused shifts in the marine ecosystems. which could cause corals to die due to changing sea temperature. As fish and other marine life rely on corals for sustenance and habitat, communities that rely on fishing are heavily affected as well. As the Philippine Sea is situated in a particularly active Western Pacific tropical cyclone basin, the physical damage caused by typhoons coming from the east can further destroy the marine habitats.

==History==
The first European to navigate the Philippine Sea was Ferdinand Magellan in 1521, who named it &quot;Mar Filipinas&quot; when he and his men were in the Mariana Islands prior to the exploration of the Philippines. Later it was discovered by other Spanish explorers from 1522 to 1565.

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===

A historic battle between the naval fleets of the United States and Japan took place in the vicinity of the Philippine Sea. This was called The Battle of the Philippine Sea, and occurred near the Mariana Islands from 19 to 20 June 1944. It was also the largest carrier-to-carrier battle in history which featured the United States Fifth Fleet and the 1st Mobile Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Aside from the navy, aerial activity was also present in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, as hundreds of aircraft from both countries fired at each other. The Americans indisputably won, and nicknamed the aerial war the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot; due to the number of Japanese aircraft shot down.

Japan struggled to recover from the severe damages of its imperial navy and air strength suffered from the battle. This heavily attributed to the victory of the United States in the Battle of the Philippine Sea which was a vital part of the Americans&#x27; reclamation of the Philippines, and the Mariana Islands from Japan.

=== Post-World War II ===
In 1989, the United States Department of Defense revealed the loss of a one-megaton nuclear bomb in the Philippine Sea during the 1965 Philippine Sea A-4 incident.

Following an escalation of the Spratly Islands dispute in 2011, various Philippine government agencies started using the designation &quot;West Philippine Sea&quot; to refer to parts of the South China Sea. However, a PAGASA spokesperson said that the sea east of the Philippine archipelago will continue to be called the Philippine Sea.

==Economy==
===Fisheries===
The Philippines depends on the Philippine Sea as one of the sources of its food, and for many people&#x27;s livelihoods. In the Coral Triangle area, the Philippines harvests seaweeds, milkfish, shrimp, oyster, mussel, and live reef fish as aquaculture products. Fishermen catch many types of fish, including small pelagic, anchovy, sardine, mackerel, and tuna, among others.

Recent scientific expeditions have found that the Benham Rise (also known as the Philippine Rise) in the Philippine Sea has a diverse marine ecosystem that attracts migratory commercial fish like tuna, marlin and mackerel. The Benham Rise is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from Aurora, Quezon and Bicol. The Philippines Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources trains fishermen in sustainable-fishing techniques to prevent the destruction of coral formations, which could negatively affect the food chain that the migratory fish depend on. Migratory fish generally sell at high prices. For example, a single bluefin tuna from the Benham Rise can be sold at market for .

<text>In linear algebra, a square matrix formula_1 is called diagonalizable or non-defective if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. That is, if there exists an invertible matrix formula_2 and a diagonal matrix formula_3 such that . This is equivalent to (Such formula_3 are not unique.) This property exists for any linear map: for a finite-dimensional vector space a linear map formula_5 is called diagonalizable if there exists an ordered basis of formula_6 consisting of eigenvectors of formula_7. These definitions are equivalent: if formula_7 has a matrix representation formula_9 as above, then the column vectors of formula_2 form a basis consisting of eigenvectors of and the diagonal entries of formula_3 are the corresponding eigenvalues of with respect to this eigenvector basis, formula_7 is represented by 

Diagonalization is the process of finding the above formula_2 and and makes many subsequent computations easier. One can raise a diagonal matrix formula_3 to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that power. The determinant of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries. Such computations generalize easily to 

The geometric transformation represented by a diagonalizable matrix is an &quot;inhomogeneous dilation&quot; (or &quot;anisotropic scaling&quot;). That is, it can scale the space by a different amount in different directions. The direction of each eigenvector is scaled by a factor given by the corresponding eigenvalue.

A square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called &quot;defective&quot;. It can happen that a matrix formula_1 with real entries is defective over the real numbers, meaning that formula_9 is impossible for any invertible formula_2 and diagonal formula_3 with real entries, but it is possible with complex entries, so that formula_1 is diagonalizable over the complex numbers. For example, this is the case for a generic rotation matrix. 

Many results for diagonalizable matrices hold only over an algebraically closed field (such as the complex numbers). In this case, diagonalizable matrices are dense in the space of all matrices, which means any defective matrix can be deformed into a diagonalizable matrix by a small perturbation; and the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition states that any matrix is uniquely the sum of a diagonalizable matrix and a nilpotent matrix. Over an algebraically closed field, diagonalizable matrices are equivalent to semi-simple matrices.

== Definition ==
An square formula_20 matrix formula_1 with entries in a field formula_22 is called diagonalizable or nondefective if there exists an formula_20 invertible matrix (i.e. an element of the general linear group GL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;)), formula_2, such that formula_25 is a diagonal matrix.

== Characterization ==
The fundamental fact about diagonalizable maps and matrices is expressed by the following:

* An formula_20 matrix formula_1 over a field formula_22 is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of its eigenspaces is equal to formula_29, which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of formula_30 consisting of eigenvectors of formula_1. If such a basis has been found, one can form the matrix formula_2 having these basis vectors as columns, and formula_25 will be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of formula_1. The matrix formula_2 is known as a modal matrix for formula_1.
* A linear map formula_37 is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the dimensions of its eigenspaces is equal to which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of formula_6 consisting of eigenvectors of formula_7. With respect to such a basis, formula_7 will be represented by a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of this matrix are the eigenvalues of 

The following sufficient (but not necessary) condition is often useful.
* An formula_20 matrix formula_1 is diagonalizable over the field formula_22 if it has formula_29 distinct eigenvalues in i.e. if its characteristic polynomial has formula_29 distinct roots in however, the converse may be false. Consider formula_46 which has eigenvalues 1, 2, 2 (not all distinct) and is diagonalizable with diagonal form (similar to formula_47 and change of basis matrix formula_2: formula_49 The converse fails when formula_1 has an eigenspace of dimension higher than 1. In this example, the eigenspace of formula_1 associated with the eigenvalue 2 has dimension 2.
* A linear map formula_37 with formula_53 is diagonalizable if it has formula_29 distinct eigenvalues, i.e. if its characteristic polynomial has formula_29 distinct roots in formula_22.

Let formula_1 be a matrix over If formula_1 is diagonalizable, then so is any power of it. Conversely, if formula_1 is invertible, formula_22 is algebraically closed, and formula_61 is diagonalizable for some formula_29 that is not an integer multiple of the characteristic of then formula_1 is diagonalizable. Proof: If formula_61 is diagonalizable, then formula_1 is annihilated by some polynomial which has no multiple root (since and is divided by the minimal polynomial of 

Over the complex numbers formula_66, almost every matrix is diagonalizable. More precisely: the set of complex formula_20 matrices that are &quot;not&quot; diagonalizable over considered as a subset of has Lebesgue measure zero. One can also say that the diagonalizable matrices form a dense subset with respect to the Zariski topology: the non-diagonalizable matrices lie inside the vanishing set of the discriminant of the characteristic polynomial, which is a hypersurface. From that follows also density in the usual (&quot;strong&quot;) topology given by a norm. The same is not true over 

The Jordan–Chevalley decomposition expresses an operator as the sum of its semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable) part and its nilpotent part. Hence, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its nilpotent part is zero. Put in another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if each block in its Jordan form has no nilpotent part; i.e., each &quot;block&quot; is a one-by-one matrix.

== Diagonalization ==
Consider the two following arbitrary bases formula_68 and formula_69. Suppose that there exists a linear transformation represented by a matrix formula_70 which is written with respect to basis E. Suppose also that there exists the following eigen-equation:

formula_71

The alpha eigenvectors are written also with respect to the E basis. Since the set F is both a set of eigenvectors for matrix A and it spans some arbitrary vector space, then we say that there exists a matrix formula_72 which is a diagonal matrix that is similar to formula_70. In other words, formula_70 is a diagonalizable matrix if the matrix is written in the basis F. We perform the change of basis calculation using the transition matrix formula_75, which changes basis from E to F as follows:

formula_76,

where formula_77 is the transition matrix from E-basis to F-basis. The inverse can then be equated to a new transition matrix formula_78 which changes basis from F to E instead and so we have the following relationship : 

formula_79

Both formula_80 and formula_78 transition matrices are invertible. Thus we can manipulate the matrices in the following fashion:formula_82The matrix formula_83 will be denoted as formula_84, which is still in the E-basis. Similarly, the diagonal matrix is in the F-basis.
If a matrix formula_1 can be diagonalized, that is,

: formula_86

then:

: formula_87

The transition matrix S has the E-basis vectors as columns written in the basis F. Inversely, the inverse transition matrix P has F-basis vectors formula_88 written in the basis of E so that we can represent P in block matrix form in the following manner:

:formula_89

as a result we can write:formula_90

In block matrix form, we can consider the A-matrix to be a matrix of 1x1 dimensions whilst P is a 1xn dimensional matrix. The D-matrix can be written in full form with all the diagonal elements as an nxn dimensional matrix:

formula_91

Performing the above matrix multiplication we end up with the following result:formula_92Taking each component of the block matrix individually on both sides, we end up with the following:
:formula_93

So the column vectors of formula_2 are right eigenvectors of {{nowrap|formula_1,}} and the corresponding diagonal entry is the corresponding eigenvalue. The invertibility of formula_2 also suggests that the eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis of {{nowrap|formula_97.}} This is the necessary and sufficient condition for diagonalizability and the canonical approach of diagonalization. The row vectors of formula_98 are the left eigenvectors of {{nowrap|formula_1.}}

When a complex matrix formula_100 is a Hermitian matrix (or more generally a normal matrix), eigenvectors of formula_1 can be chosen to form an orthonormal basis of {{nowrap|formula_102,}} and formula_2 can be chosen to be a unitary matrix. If in addition, formula_104 is a real symmetric matrix, then its eigenvectors can be chosen to be an orthonormal basis of formula_105 and formula_2 can be chosen to be an orthogonal matrix.

For most practical work matrices are diagonalized numerically using computer software. Many algorithms exist to accomplish this.

== Simultaneous diagonalization ==
{{See also|Triangular matrix#Simultaneous triangularisability|l1=Simultaneous triangularisability|Weight (representation theory)|Positive definite matrix#Simultaneous_diagonalization|l3=Positive definite matrix}}

A set of matrices is said to be &quot;simultaneously diagonalizable&quot; if there exists a single invertible matrix formula_2 such that formula_25 is a diagonal matrix for every formula_1 in the set. The following theorem characterizes simultaneously diagonalizable matrices: A set of diagonalizable matrices commutes if and only if the set is simultaneously diagonalizable.{{rp|p. 64}}

The set of all formula_20 diagonalizable matrices (over {{nowrap|formula_66)}} with formula_112 is not simultaneously diagonalizable. For instance, the matrices

:formula_113

are diagonalizable but not simultaneously diagonalizable because they do not commute.

A set consists of commuting normal matrices if and only if it is simultaneously diagonalizable by a unitary matrix; that is, there exists a unitary matrix formula_114 such that formula_115 is diagonal for every formula_1 in the set.

In the language of Lie theory, a set of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices generates a toral Lie algebra.

== Examples ==

=== Diagonalizable matrices ===
* Involutions are diagonalizable over the reals (and indeed any field of characteristic not 2), with ±1 on the diagonal.
* Finite order endomorphisms are diagonalizable over formula_117 (or any algebraically closed field where the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the endomorphism) with roots of unity on the diagonal. This follows since the minimal polynomial is separable, because the roots of unity are distinct.
* Projections are diagonalizable, with 0s and 1s on the diagonal.
* Real symmetric matrices are diagonalizable by orthogonal matrices; i.e., given a real symmetric matrix {{nowrap|formula_1,}} formula_119 is diagonal for some orthogonal matrix {{nowrap|formula_120.}} More generally, matrices are diagonalizable by unitary matrices if and only if they are normal. In the case of the real symmetric matrix, we see that {{nowrap|formula_121,}} so clearly formula_122 holds. Examples of normal matrices are real symmetric (or skew-symmetric) matrices (e.g. covariance matrices) and Hermitian matrices (or skew-Hermitian matrices). See spectral theorems for generalizations to infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

=== Matrices that are not diagonalizable ===
In general, a rotation matrix is not diagonalizable over the reals, but all rotation matrices are diagonalizable over the complex field. Even if a matrix is not diagonalizable, it is always possible to &quot;do the best one can&quot;, and find a matrix with the same properties consisting of eigenvalues on the leading diagonal, and either ones or zeroes on the superdiagonal – known as Jordan normal form.

Some matrices are not diagonalizable over any field, most notably nonzero nilpotent matrices. This happens more generally if the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue do not coincide. For instance, consider

:formula_123

This matrix is not diagonalizable: there is no matrix formula_114 such that formula_125 is a diagonal matrix. Indeed, formula_126 has one eigenvalue (namely zero) and this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.

Some real matrices are not diagonalizable over the reals. Consider for instance the matrix

:formula_127

The matrix formula_128 does not have any real eigenvalues, so there is no real matrix formula_120 such that formula_130 is a diagonal matrix. However, we can diagonalize formula_128 if we allow complex numbers. Indeed, if we take

:formula_132

then formula_130 is diagonal. It is easy to find that formula_128 is the rotation matrix which rotates counterclockwise by angle formula_135

Note that the above examples show that the sum of diagonalizable matrices need not be diagonalizable.

=== How to diagonalize a matrix ===
Diagonalizing a matrix is the same process as finding its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, in the case that the eigenvectors form a basis. For example, consider the matrix

:formula_136

The roots of the characteristic polynomial formula_137 are the eigenvalues {{nowrap|formula_138.}} Solving the linear system formula_139 gives the eigenvectors formula_140 and {{nowrap|formula_141,}} while formula_142 gives {{nowrap|formula_143;}} that is, formula_144 for {{nowrap|formula_145.}} These vectors form a basis of {{nowrap|formula_146,}} so we can assemble them as the column vectors of a change-of-basis matrix formula_2 to get:
formula_148
We may see this equation in terms of transformations: formula_2 takes the standard basis to the eigenbasis, {{nowrap|formula_150,}} so we have:
formula_151
so that formula_152 has the standard basis as its eigenvectors, which is the defining property of {{nowrap|formula_3.}} 

Note that there is no preferred order of the eigenvectors in {{nowrap|formula_2;}} changing the order of the eigenvectors in formula_2 just changes the order of the eigenvalues in the diagonalized form of {{nowrap|formula_1.}}

== Application to matrix functions ==
Diagonalization can be used to efficiently compute the powers of a matrix {{nowrap|formula_9:}}

: formula_158

and the latter is easy to calculate since it only involves the powers of a diagonal matrix. For example, for the matrix formula_1 with eigenvalues formula_160 in the example above we compute:

: formula_161

This approach can be generalized to matrix exponential and other matrix functions that can be defined as power series. For example, defining {{nowrap|formula_162,}} we have:
: formula_163

This is particularly useful in finding closed form expressions for terms of linear recursive sequences, such as the Fibonacci numbers.

=== Particular application ===
For example, consider the following matrix:

:formula_164

Calculating the various powers of formula_165 reveals a surprising pattern:

:formula_166

The above phenomenon can be explained by diagonalizing {{nowrap|formula_165.}} To accomplish this, we need a basis of formula_168 consisting of eigenvectors of {{nowrap|formula_165.}} One such eigenvector basis is given by

:formula_170

where e&quot;i&quot; denotes the standard basis of R&quot;n&quot;. The reverse change of basis is given by

:formula_171

Straightforward calculations show that

:formula_172

Thus, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the eigenvalues corresponding to u and v, respectively. By linearity of matrix multiplication, we have that

:formula_173

Switching back to the standard basis, we have

:formula_174

The preceding relations, expressed in matrix form, are

:formula_175

thereby explaining the above phenomenon.

== Quantum mechanical application ==
In quantum mechanical and quantum chemical computations matrix diagonalization is one of the most frequently applied numerical processes. The basic reason is that the time-independent Schrödinger equation is an eigenvalue equation, albeit in most of the physical situations on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.

A very common approximation is to truncate (or project) the Hilbert space to finite dimension, after which the Schrödinger equation can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem of a real symmetric, or complex Hermitian matrix. Formally this approximation is founded on the variational principle, valid for Hamiltonians that are bounded from below.

First-order perturbation theory also leads to matrix eigenvalue problem for degenerate states.

<text>John Joseph Burnette (March 25, 1934 – August 14, 1964) was an American singer and songwriter of rockabilly and pop music. In 1952, Johnny, his brother Dorsey Burnette, and their mutual friend Paul Burlison, formed the band that became known as the Rock and Roll Trio. His career was cut short on August 14, 1964, when he drowned following a boat accident, aged 30.

He is the father of 1980s rockabilly singer Rocky Burnette.

== Early life ==
Johnny Burnette was born to Willie May and Dorsey Burnett Sr. in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. (The &quot;e&quot; at the end of his name was added later.) Johnny grew up with his parents and Dorsey Jr. in a public housing project in the Lauderdale Courts area of Memphis, which from 1948 until 1954 was also the home of Gladys and Vernon Presley and their son, Elvis.

Johnny attended Blessed Sacrament School, and after graduating from eighth grade he went to Catholic High School, in Memphis. He showed an aptitude for sports, being on the school baseball team and playing linebacker on the football team. Both he and Dorsey were also keen amateur boxers and later became Golden Gloves champions. After leaving high school, Burnette tried his hand at becoming a professional boxer, but after one fight with a sixty-dollar purse and a broken nose, he decided to quit boxing. He went to work on barges traversing the Mississippi River, where Dorsey also worked. Johnny worked mainly as a deck hand; Dorsey worked as an oiler. After work, they would go back to Memphis and perform songs in local bars with a varying array of sidemen, including another former Golden Gloves champion, Paul Burlison, whom Dorsey had met at an amateur boxing tournament in Memphis in 1949.

== The Rock and Roll Trio ==
In 1952, the Burnette brothers and Burlison formed a group called the Rhythm Rangers. Johnny sang and played acoustic guitar, Dorsey played bass and Paul Burlison played lead guitar. For economic reasons, the three moved to New York in 1956 and managed to get an audition for Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot;. Winning the competition three times in a row gained them a place in the finals and a recording contract with Coral Records, and they renamed themselves the Rock and Roll Trio. They also gained a manager, the bandleader Henry Jerome, and a drummer, Tony Austin (a cousin of Carl Perkins).

Promotional appearances were arranged on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; and Perry Como&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, together with a summer tour with Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent. On Sunday September 9, 1956, they appeared as finalists on the &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot; at Madison Square Garden, singing &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. Despite this activity, the three singles this rock and roll trio had released over this period failed to reach any national hit parade. This might be due to a result of Elvis Presley who appeared on a CBS television program that was broadcast live from Los Angeles, CA at exactly the same time that this Burnette trio had performed on ABC televised &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot; in New York. Furthermore, the CBS show that had broadcast Elvis in Los Angeles, had garnered an 82.6% share, or 60,710,000 viewers, whereas the ABC and NBC networks had garnered less than 5 million viewers each.

In order to cover their living expenses, the Trio was forced to go on the road, for what seemed to be an endless stream of one-night stands. This exhausting regime led to squabbles, which were exacerbated in Dorsey&#x27;s case by Jerome&#x27;s use of the name Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio on records and live dates. Things finally came to a head at a gig in Niagara Falls in autumn 1956, when, as a result of a fight, Dorsey quit the group a week before they were to appear in Alan Freed&#x27;s film &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;.

Johnny Black, the brother of Elvis&#x27;s bassist Bill Black, was rapidly recruited to fill Dorsey&#x27;s place. Despite the film appearance and three more single releases and one LP release, the group failed to achieve any chart success. The Rock and Roll Trio disbanded in autumn 1957.

== Success in California with Ricky Nelson ==
Now unemployed in Memphis, Burnette decided to try his luck in California. He and a friend, Joe Campbell, hitchhiked to the West Coast, where they joined Dorsey. With their past differences forgotten, the brothers attempted to resurrect the Rock and Roll Trio and sent for Paul Burlison. He joined them briefly but decided to return to Memphis and concentrate on his electrical business. Dorsey and Johnny continued with their songwriting, but Dorsey kept his day job as an electrician to pay the family expenses.

The Burnettes&#x27; brashness got them their first success in the music business in California. On arriving in Los Angeles, Joe Campbell bought a copy of &quot;A Map to the Stars&quot;, which showed the location of the house of the teen idol Ricky Nelson. In an effort to get their songs to him, the Burnettes and Campbell decided to sit on the steps of his house until they could get a meeting with him. Their persistence worked, and Nelson was sufficiently impressed with their work that he eventually recorded several of their songs, including &quot;Believe What You Say&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot;, &quot;Waitin&#x27; in School&quot;, and &quot;Just a Little Too Much&quot;, amongst others. Other Imperial Records artists, such as Roy Brown, benefited from their songwriting. The success of his recording of the brothers&#x27; &quot;Hip Shakin&#x27; Baby&quot; led to a recording contract with Imperial Records as a duo. While in California, they met Doyle Holly, who played bass guitar for a short time with the band. Holly went on to become the bass player for Buck Owens and the Buckaroos and to record as a solo artist.

As the Burnette Brothers, they released one single, for Imperial, &quot;Warm Love&quot; backed with &quot;My Honey&quot; (Imperial X5509), on May 5, 1958. It did not make the charts. After this failure, they continued to work together as songwriters but began to follow separate careers as performing artists. In 1961, however, Johnny and Dorsey released two instrumental singles, credited to the Texans, for two small labels, Infinity and Gothic: &quot;Green Grass of Texas&quot; backed with &quot;Bloody River&quot; (Infinity INX-001), released on February 20, 1961, and &quot;Rockin&#x27; Johnny Home&quot; backed with &quot;Ole Reb&quot; (Gothic GOX-001), released on May 29, 1961. Another instrumental, &quot;Lonely Island&quot; backed with&quot;Green Hills&quot; (Liberty 55460), credited to the Shamrocks, was released by Liberty Records on June 6, 1962. &quot;Green Grass of Texas&quot; and &quot;Bloody River&quot; were to be re-released in February 1965 on the Vee Jay label (VJ 658), again credited to the Texans.

== Solo career ==
=== The Liberty years ===
In the fall of 1958, Johnny Burnette obtained a recording contract as a solo artist with Freedom Records, an offshoot of Liberty Records. He released three singles on this label: &quot;Kiss Me&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;m Restless&quot; (44001), released on September 11, 1958; &quot;Gumbo&quot; backed with &quot;Me and the Bear&quot; (44011), released on March 6, 1959; and &quot;Sweet Baby Doll&quot; backed with &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love Again&quot; (44017), released on June 24, 1959. All of these songs except &quot;Sweet Baby Doll&quot; were written by Burnette. None of these records were hits.

In mid-1959, the Freedom label was shut down, and Burnette moved to the parent Liberty label, under the direction of the producer Snuff Garrett. Liberty had better promotional capabilities than Freedom, so that Johnny&#x27;s singles for Liberty stood a greater chance of succeeding. His first two singles for Liberty, &quot;Settin&#x27; the Woods on Fire&quot; backed with &quot;Kentucky Waltz&quot; (Liberty F-55222), released on November 10, 1959, and &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; backed with &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot; (Liberty F-55243), released on March 4, 1960, sold well regionally but were not national hits. However, his third single, &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot; backed with &quot;Cincinnati Fireball&quot; (Liberty F-55285), released on May 4, 1960, reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 5 in Britain. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

His fourth Liberty single, &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot; (written by the Sherman Brothers) backed with &quot;I Beg Your Pardon&quot; (Liberty F-55285), released on October 5, 1960, did even better, reaching number 8 on the Hot 100 and number 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and earned another gold record for him. Burnette went back into the studio and under Snuff Garrett&#x27;s direction recorded &quot;Little Boy Sad&quot;. This was released on January 3, 1961, backed with &quot;(I Go) Down to the River&quot; (Liberty F-55298). Shortly after its release, Burnette was hospitalized with a ruptured appendix, which kept him bedridden for several weeks. He was unable to undertake many personal appearances to promote the new record, and it reached only number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 12 in Britain. Frustrated by this prolonged inactivity he tried to return to work too early, and he promptly collapsed. This meant that his fifth Liberty single, &quot;Big Big World&quot; backed with &quot;Ballad of the One Eyed Jacks&quot; (Liberty F-55318), released on March 30, 1961, received no promotion at all and reached only number 58 on the Hot 100.

His sixth Liberty single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lot of Things to Do&quot; backed with &quot;Girls&quot; (Liberty F-55345), released June 14, 1961, was handled differently from his previous records. In Britain, the upbeat side, &quot;Girls&quot;, was promoted as the topside and reached number 23 in the UK chart in September 1961. In the United States it was flipped over with &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Lot of Things to Do&quot; as the topside, but despite heavy promotion it failed to become a hit, peaking just outside the Hot 100 at number 109.

After recovering from his illness, Burnette returned to the road with a tour of Northern cities, culminating in a season at the Brooklyn Paramount Theatre, after which he undertook a tour of Australia with Connie Francis. Back in the limelight, his next release was scheduled to be a Carl Perkins song, &quot;Fools Like Me&quot;, backed with &quot;Honestly I Do&quot; (Liberty 55377), but this was canceled in favor of &quot;God, Country and My Baby&quot; backed with &quot;Honestly I Do&quot; (Liberty 55379), which was released on September 27, 1961. It reached number 18 on the Hot 100, but was to be Burnette&#x27;s last major American hit.

In 1962, Burnette toured Britain for the first time, with Gary U.S. Bonds and Gene McDaniels, where he made an appearance on the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; Poll Winners&#x27; Concert and several TV appearances. His next single &quot;Clown Shoes&quot; backed with &quot;The Way I Am&quot; (Liberty 55416) was released on January 26, 1962, but it failed to make the US Hot 100. It was more successful in Britain, where it reached number 35. &quot;Clown Shoes&quot; was written by P. J. Proby.

Burnette had two more single releases on Liberty Records. These were &quot;The Fool of the Year&quot; backed with &quot;The Poorest Boy in Town&quot; (Liberty 55448), which was released on April 13, 1962, and &quot;Damn the Defiant&quot; backed with &quot;Lonesome Waters&quot; (Liberty 55489), which was released on July 30, 1962. Neither of these singles was a hit, but &quot;Damn the Defiant&quot;, a Johnny Horton–style naval saga, was Burnette&#x27;s first self-penned A-side for Liberty, It was also his last single for the label.

=== The Chancellor stint ===
Burnette moved to Chancellor Records, which had had success with teen idols like Fabian Forte and Frankie Avalon. Chancellor released three singles by Burnette in 1962: &quot;I Wanna Thank Your Folks&quot; backed with &quot;The Giant&quot; (Chancellor C-1116), &quot;Tag Along&quot; backed with &quot;Party Girl&quot; (Chancellor C-1123) and &quot;Remember Me (I&#x27;m the One Who Loves You)&quot; backed with &quot;Time Is Not Enough&quot; (Chancellor C-1129). None of these singles were hits.

=== The Capitol sessions ===
Burnette moved on from Chancellor, briefly joining Dorsey on Reprise Records for one single, &quot;Hey Sue&quot; backed with &quot;It Don&#x27;t Take Much&quot; (20153), before signing a one-year contract with Capitol Records in the summer of 1963. Johnny&#x27;s first recording session was held on July 23, 1963, at the Capitol Tower with Jim Economides and Jimmie Haskell overseeing the proceedings. A number of tracks were recorded: &quot;It Isn&#x27;t There&quot;, &quot;Wish It Were Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Give You Three Guesses&quot;, &quot;All Week Long&quot; and &quot;Congratulations, You&#x27;ve Hurt Me Again&quot;. Of these &quot;It Isn&#x27;t There&quot; backed with &quot;Wish It Were Saturday Night&quot; (Capitol 5023) were issued on August 19, 1963, as his first American single. In Britain, the flipside was changed to &quot;All Week Long&quot;, but neither single made the charts. On December 13, 1963, a second session was held, with the same two men in charge. Four more songs were recorded, of which &quot;The Opposite&quot; backed with &quot;You Taught Me the Way to Love You&quot; (Capitol 5114) was released as a single on January 20, 1964. Again it failed to find chart success. A third session was held on February 14, 1964, which produced four songs: &quot;Aunt Marie&quot;, &quot;Two Feet in Front of Me&quot;, &quot;If I Were An Artist&quot;, and &quot;And Her Name Is Scarlett&quot;. None of these songs were deemed fit for release and remained in the can for thirty years. A fourth session was held on March 16, 1964, which was overseen by David Gates, who later went on to fame with the band Bread. This session produced &quot;Sweet Suzie, I Think She Knows&quot; and &quot;It All Depends on Linda&quot;, which was written by Bobby Bare. Of these songs, &quot;Sweet Suzie&quot; backed with &quot;Walkin&#x27; Talkin&#x27; Doll&quot;, which had been held back from the December 1963 session, were released as Capitol single (Capitol 5176) on April 5, 1964. This single also failed to make the charts.

=== Sahara and Magic Lamp labels ===
When his Capitol contract ran out, Burnette decided to take charge of his own affairs on his own terms. He formed his own label Sahara and in July 1964 released the single &quot;Fountain of Love&quot; backed with &quot;What a Summer Day&quot; (Sahara 512). When he was informed that the name Sahara had already been taken, he renamed the label Magic Lamp and a different single, &quot;Bigger Man&quot; backed with &quot;Less Than a Heartbeat&quot; (Magic Lamp 515) was released.

== Death ==
On August 14, 1964, Burnette&#x27;s unlit fishing boat was struck by an unaware cabin cruiser in Clear Lake, California. The impact threw him off the boat, and he drowned. When he received the news, Dorsey Burnette called Paul Burlison, who flew out to comfort him and attend Johnny&#x27;s funeral. The two men were to keep in touch until Dorsey&#x27;s death of a heart attack in 1979. Johnny Burnette is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Legacy ==
Burnette gained renewed prominence in 1973 thanks to Ringo Starr&#x27;s version of &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;. In addition, Burnette&#x27;s original song was recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. One of his songs, &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; by Tiny Bradshaw, would later be recorded by the Yardbirds, Aerosmith and Motörhead. Early British rock and roll power trio and proto punk garage band Johnny Kidd and the Pirates and psychobilly band The Meteors both covered &quot;Lonesome Train.&quot;

The Cramps covered his song &quot;Tear it Up&quot;, Poison Ivy heavily influenced by Burnette&#x27;s raw guitar style and Lux Interior borrowing Burnette&#x27;s vocal approach, and fellow rockabilly band Tav Falco&#x27;s Panther Burns did a cover of &quot;You&#x27;re Undecided&quot;, both songs from Burnette&#x27;s first album and again, heavily indebted to Burnette quivering, emotional vocal delivery.

The Beatles, with John Lennon on vocal, performed &quot;Lonesome Tears in My Eyes&quot; at the BBC on July 10, 1963, for broadcast airing on July 23, 1963. During the airing Lennon introduced the song, originally recorded by Johnny Burnette and the Rock &#x27;n Roll Trio on July 3, 1956, and released in March 1957, joking, &quot;This is a Dorsey Burnette number, brother of Johnny Burnette, called &#x27;Lonesome Tears in My Eyes&#x27;, recorded on their very first LP in 1822!&quot; The song also influenced a later Beatles song, &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; in that the outro guitar riff to that song was inspired by the corresponding intro guitar riff on &quot;Lonesome Tears in My Eyes&quot;. This live in-studio recording of &quot;Lonesome Tears in My Eyes&quot; (including Lennon&#x27;s spoken intro) was later included on the Beatles&#x27; 1994 two-CD set, &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;.

<text>A pipe band is a musical ensemble consisting of pipers and drummers. The term pipes and drums, used by military pipe bands is also common.

The most common form of pipe band consists of a section of pipers playing the Great Highland bagpipe, a section of snare drummers (often referred to as &#x27;side drummers&#x27;), several tenor drummers and usually one, though occasionally two, bass drummers. The tenor drummers and bass drummer are referred to collectively as the &#x27;bass section&#x27; (or in North America as the &#x27;midsection&#x27;), and the entire drum section is collectively known as the drum corps. The band follows the direction of the pipe major; when on parade the band may be led by a drum major, who directs the band with a mace. Standard instrumentation for a pipe band involves 6 to 25 pipers, 3 to 10 side drummers, 1 to 6 tenor drummers and 1 bass drummer. Occasionally this instrumentation is augmented to include additional instruments (such as additional percussion instruments or keyboard instruments), but this is typically done only in concert settings.

Pipe bands started in Scottish Regiments of the British Army, in the nineteenth century. The tradition then spread to former British colonies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, as well as constituents of the Commonwealth of Nations. In addition, a number of other countries have adopted the tradition, notably in areas with Celtic roots: Ireland (circa 1900), Brittany in Northwestern France (1940s), and the regions of Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria in Northern Spain.

==History==

The pipe band&#x27;s origins are in the military, but are obscure as contemporary historical regimental records had no direct interest in piping, giving only hints at details. The Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association maintains that the origin of military pipe bands are traced back to the early 1800s as soldiers tasked with keeping pace and morale on long marches with their respective regiments. The global spread of piping can also be directly attributed with British colonial expansion. Pipers and drummers in the employ of the British Army and Scottish emigrants brought with them traditional music and the culture surrounding the practice.

It is known that pipers served in regiments from the earliest times; the Royal Scots have records referring to pipers dating back to the early seventeenth century.
During this time, soldiers specially employed as pipers were employed by the officers of the regiments as private pipers, although countless others were certainly trained in piping while serving.
This situation continued until the 1840s, when Queen Victoria&#x27;s enthusiasm for all things Highland was instrumental in the War Office&#x27;s decision that each battalion of the Highland regiments be allowed five pipers and a pipe major, which continues to be all that the British Army provides funds for to this day. Any additional pipers in the battalion pipe band were and are equipped today by funds from the officers&#x27; mess fund of the battalion.

By this time, pipers were already playing together with drummers, probably modelling themselves on the fife and drum bands which had existed in Switzerland since the 15th century. Drumming itself is as ancient as the concept of formed military units, and their original purpose on the battlefield was to signal tactical movements and keep cadence on the march.

By the time World War I broke out, the pipe band represented a popular image of Scotland, both internally and externally. Military pipers were killed and injured in significant numbers in the Great War, before the practice of playing in the trenches was banned. The ban was often not observed; Canadian piper James Richardson was awarded the Victoria Cross for playing in action in 1916. Pipes have occasionally played into battle, notably at El Alamein, Dieppe, the Normandy beaches, and the crossing of the Rhine. The Calgary Highlanders went into action for the first time at Hill 67 in Normandy with company pipers playing; it was the only time the Regiment did so.
Military pipers have also served in both Gulf Wars.

==Military pipes and drums==
Pipe bands have long been part of military tradition, most notably in the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Many of the same standard tunes are found in both the military and civilian pipe band repertoires, and many similarities exist in terms of musical style, historical and musical influences, and dress and deportment.
Military bandsmen as full time musicians in British Army bands are normally required to take on a secondary role in the battlefield as medics. However, in most cases, soldiers in the pipes and drums in a Scottish or Irish infantry regiment are fully trained infantrymen who constitute a machine gun or mortar platoon, or are Assault Pioneers or as a rifle platoon. (This is similar to corps of drums in an English or Welsh infantry regiment although their tradition of fifes and drums is quite separate from that of the Highland bagpipes). As a result, in addition to being musicians, members of the pipes and drums must also be qualified fighting soldiers. Unlike musicians, who belong to the Royal Corps of Army Music, the pipers and drummers belong to the regiment in which they serve and are combat soldiers first and foremost. Pipers in particular uphold a centuries-old tradition of inspiring soldiers in the field and this can be traced back into Scotland&#x27;s clan system to the 16th century at least.

In other parts of the world, military pipe bands are generally part of reserve regiments, and also draw civilian members into their ranks.

The British Army runs its own pipes and drums training facility, the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming, in Edinburgh, Scotland. To be qualified as a pipe major or drum major in the pipes and drums of a regiment of the British Army, candidates must successfully pass a series of courses at the school.

==Music==

The music played by pipe bands generally consists of music from the Scottish tradition, the Irish tradition and the Breton tradition, either in the form of traditional folk tunes and dances or popular music that has been adapted for pipes. Examples of typical pipe bands forms include marches, slow airs, jigs and reels, and strathspeys. In recent years there has been a great deal of emphasis placed on new forms, especially the suite. A good example of a suite for pipe band is Don Thompson&#x27;s composition &quot;Journey to Skye&quot; (1987).

In conventional pipe band music, each section of instruments has a different role in the music. Generally speaking, the pipers deliver the melodic and harmonic material, while the side drummers provide a rhythmically interactive accompaniment part. The tenor drummers provide rhythmic pulses and the bass drummer anchors the rhythms, providing a strong and steady beat.

===Pipe section===
The bagpipers are responsible for providing all melodic material in the music. Generally speaking, all of the pipers play a unison melody on their chanters, with their drones providing the harmonic support and filling out the sound.

When harmony is written within the pipe section, it is usually a two-part harmony, and is usually scored in a 2:1 ratio (with two-thirds of the players on the melody and one third of the players on the harmony part). Because of the limited range of the chanter, the harmonic possibilities are somewhat limited, but well-written harmony in a pipe band setting can be extremely effective. Pipe band harmony is sometimes referred to as &#x27;seconds&#x27;, although this simply refers to a second part and not to the interval of a second. In fact, intervals of a second are rarely found in pipe band harmony parts, except in passing. Instead, it is the consonant intervals which are stressed, such as perfect fourths and fifths, and even more commonly, parallel thirds and sixths.

In contemporary arrangements, a merge between harmony and melody known as &#x27;counter-melody&#x27; has been aired. A counter-melody is similar to a harmony part, but is distinguished because it has a melodic line of its own. Counter-melody can take a completely different thematic approach and can dramatically change the flow and atmosphere of the melodic unison. This technique is relatively new in the pipe band circuit, and in most cases require skill and timing to achieve in full unison.

===Drum corps===
The drum corps of a pipe band consists of a section of drummers playing highland snare drums and the bass section. In the early days of pipe bands, rope tension snare drums were common, but as bagpipe tuning pitches became higher, a brighter tone was demanded from the drum corps. Pipe band drummers now play on drums with very tight, knitted kevlar heads, designed for maximum tension to create a very crisp and strident sound. Since today&#x27;s drum is so facile as a result of its design, players are often able to execute extremely complicated and technically demanding rudimentary patterns.

The pipe band drum corps is responsible for both supporting the piping with a solid rhythmic foundation and sense of pulse, often creating an interesting contrapuntal line unto itself. The line played by the drum corps (referred to as the &#x27;drum score&#x27;) is usually based on rudimentary patterns and can often be quite involved, with solo, unison and contrapuntal passages throughout. A popular pattern in many scores is for the lead drummer to play a phrase, and the section to play in response. This technique is known as seconds (sometimes referred to as chips, or forte). The drum corps is also responsible for the dynamics of the band. Given that the bagpipes are at a constant volume, it is the drum corps which adds dynamic effect to the ensemble by varying the weight of playing and the number of players playing at any given time. 

While standard practice in pipe bands is for the pipe section to perform the traditional or standard arrangements of the melodies, including gracenotes, drum scores are very often composed by the lead drummer of the band.

====Bass section====
The bass section (also referred to as a midsection) consists of a section of tenor drummers and a bass drummer. Their role is to provide rhythmic support to the entire ensemble. In this respect, the bass section allows the drum corps to delegate their timekeeping responsibilities and allows more freedom in the drum scores.

Generally, the bass drum provides a steady pulse, playing on the downbeat and on the strong beats of the bar, and the tenors support that pulse, often adding supporting beats, accents and dynamic interest.

Tenor drums in their modern form are a relatively new addition to the pipe band. While pipe bands of the past would often include tenor drummers, they would usually be &quot;swinging tenors&quot;, players who would swing their sticks for elaborate visual effect but who would rarely play. They are more known as flourishing tenors. Today&#x27;s tenor drummers play pitched drums, and careful thought is given as to which pitches to use and at which times. The pitches help provide melodic or harmonic accompaniment to the bagpipes; creating a more dynamic flow between the drum corps and the pipe corps. In some cases, five or six tenor drummers have been used, providing a palette of individual pitches for use in a variety of musical situations. The swinging also known as flourishing has developed somewhat into an art form, with drummers playing and swinging in unison or sequential flows. Tenor drums are also still commonly played on a soft harness, or sling, instead of the typical marching harness used by the snare drums, but shoulder harness tenors are now used by several pipe bands.

=== Band Numbers ===
Competing bands must adhere to minimum numbers requirements. Typically, a band must consist of a minimum of 6 pipers, 2 snare drummers, and 1 bass drummer with numbers varying slightly for different grades (see more on grades below). 

==Uniform==

Pipe band uniforms vary from band to band. However, the typical uniform consists of a glengarry (cap), shirt, tie, waistcoat (vest), jacket, kilt, hose and ghillie brogues. Many pipe bands wear a tartan that may reflect the area the band originated from or the history of the band. Jackets and waistcoats are usually black, and shirts are often short-sleeved for comfort. Each band also has its own tie, which can match the kilt tartan, or is sometimes merely a block colour. In competition, appearing smart in uniform is essential; some competitions have dress codes, for instance certain types of jackets only, ties must be knotted at the collar and so on.

Pipe bands often vary the uniform worn, depending on the formality of the occasion. Very formal occasions require jackets to be worn, whereas less formal occasions do not, and only the waistcoat is worn. On semi-formal occasions, the jacket is not worn, but a long-sleeved shirt is worn under the waistcoat. This increases the formality of the outfit, but decreases the comfort. On occasion, no waistcoat is worn, in which case the shirt sleeve must be of long length.

Pipe Major uniforms are usually different, to distinguish them from the other members of the band. More traditional highland dress may be worn, sometimes with a feather bonnet.

==Competition==

Competition is a primary focus for many pipe bands throughout the world. Every year, mainly in the period from spring to autumn, pipe bands around the world compete against each other at various venues, often at Highland festivals. For many, this usually culminates in the World Pipe Band Championships, held on the 2nd weekend of August. A typical season for many competing pipe bands might include ten or more of these competitions. Europe (especially the UK and Ireland), North America, Australia, and New Zealand have active competitive pipe band communities, but there are competing bands from throughout the world.

Since 1930, when the Scottish band association (today known as the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association or RSPBA) was formed, there has been a World Pipe Band Championship competition, known as &#x27;The Worlds&#x27; held annually in Glasgow during August. For competitive bands, the title of World Champion is highly coveted, and this event is seen as the culmination of a year&#x27;s worth of preparation, rehearsal and practice.

Traditionally, the entirety of the World Championships had taken place on one day in August, on Glasgow Green. However, in more recent years, the competition has been spread over Friday and Saturday, with Friday hosting a qualifying event for the Grade 1 final. Typically, several hundred bands attend across the two days, traveling from all over the world. Bands arrive early and, in most grades, are required to perform in a qualifying round which takes place in the morning. The top bands at the end of the qualifying round play in a second event in the afternoon to determine an aggregate winner.

To win, Grade One bands must perform in two events, a March, Strathspey &amp; Reel event (known as a &quot;set&quot; or &quot;MSR&quot;) which consists of three pre-arranged tunes, and a Medley event, which consists of a short selection of music chosen and arranged by the band. The rules for the medley contest are very open, requiring only a minimum and maximum time frame (between 5:30 and 7 minutes) and a minimum of different time signatures that must be played as well as two 3 pace rolls played at the beginning of the tune (also known as an attack).

In addition to performing at &#x27;The Worlds&#x27;, most internationally competitive bands participate in a season of events that are generally held during Scotland&#x27;s summer months. While events of this type are usually held at Highland Games, band competitions in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland are often large enough to be held as events unto themselves. The grading and organization of these events is generally consistent with the World Championships and the events are typically administered by the governing Pipe Band Association.

In addition to the World Pipe Band Championships, the RSPBA also typically hosts four other major championships throughout the year. These are the Scottish, British, UK, and European Pipe Band Championships. Despite their naming, these events are not limited to entrants from the region after which they are named and it is common for bands from outside these regions to enter. 

===Grading system===
Prizes at the Worlds are awarded in the following nine categories:

* Grade 1
* Grade 2
* Grade 3A
* Grade 3B
* Juvenile
* Grade 4A
* Grade 4B
* Novice Juvenile A
* Novice Juvenile B

In the Novice Juvenile and Juvenile categories, band members must be under the age of eighteen, with the exception of one &quot;adult&quot; player, often an instructor, who may serve as the Pipe Major or Pipe Sergeant. The remaining categories have no age restriction, and are instead based on proficiency. Grading and eligibility are overseen by the National Council and Music Board of the RSPBA, and bands can be downgraded or upgraded at the annual regrading, which takes place at the end of the competition season. A band can apply for downgrading, but will have to compete in two further contests in their existing grade.

Because of time constraints, the RSPBA uses &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; designations in Grade 3, 4, and Novice Juvenile for major competitions. In doing so, bands are grouped based on prior-years&#x27; performances, and can receive promotions within their respective grade. These vary slightly throughout the world. For example, in the Republic of Ireland and North America, Grade 4B is known as Grade 5, and in Australia and New Zealand there is no Novice grade at all.

==Non-competitive piping==

Many pipe bands perform in parades and other public events as a primary activity. These bands are sometimes referred to as &quot;street bands&quot; or &quot;parade bands&quot;. Some military bands fall into this category as well, playing for regimental functions in lieu of, or supplemented by, competitions and/or concerts.

In recent times, concert performances have become increasingly popular. The purely musical nature of these venues enable the exploration of non-traditional repertoire, and serves as another means by which piping and drumming can present itself to the public in a modern fashion.

==Bagad==

A lesser-known type of pipe band that has already expanded the pipe band genre is the bagad, a Breton cultural phenomenon. Bagads began in the thirties to counter the widespread decay of the living Breton folk tradition.

A modern-day bagad consists of a biniou braz (Breton bagpipes), a bombarde section, a drum corps, and any additional musical instruments the band wishes to add. 
Common additions are clarinets, brass instruments (often trumpets or saxophones), guitars, and other forms of binious.

<text>The Scottish smallpipe is a bellows-blown bagpipe re-developed by Colin Ross and many others, adapted from an earlier design of the instrument. There are surviving bellows-blown examples of similar historical instruments as well as the mouth-blown Montgomery smallpipes, dated 1757, which are held in the National Museum of Scotland. Some instruments are being built as direct copies of historical examples, but few modern instruments are directly modelled on older examples; the modern instrument is typically larger and lower-pitched. The innovations leading to the modern instrument, in particular the design of the reeds, were largely taken from the Northumbrian smallpipes.

Although there is evidence of small pipes dating back to 15th century, in its current form it is perhaps the youngest bagpipe with widespread popularity, having only existed in this form since the early 1980s.

==Characteristics==

Scottish smallpipes are distinguished from the Northumbrian smallpipes by the open ended chanter, and usually by the lack of keys. This means that the sound of the chanter is continuous, rather than staccato, and that its range is only nine notes, rather than the octave and a sixth range of the later 18th/early 19th century Northumbrian pipes.

The instrument has a cylindrically bored chanter, most commonly pitched in A; pipes in D, C, B flat, and G are also common. Being cylindrically bored, the chanter sounds an octave lower than a conical-bored chanter of the same size, such as that of the Border pipes.The basic scale of the Scottish smallpipe is identical to the Mixolydian scale of the Highland and Border bagpipes: the 7th (leading) note on the scale is flattened, meaning in the case of an A chanter, the low and high G notes are natural, rather than sharp (as they would be in the scale of A major.)

Scottish smallpipes are most commonly tuned to be played with the same fingering system as Highland bagpipes (sometimes called &#x27;half-covered&#x27;), however they can also be tuned to accept a &#x27;covered&#x27; fingering system (very similar to that of the &#x27;closed&#x27; system used for Northumbrian smallpipes), where only one finger is lifted from the chanter to play each note, the only difference to the Northumbrian system being that the tonic tonehole on the chanter is left uncovered (except when playing the low leading note.)

Scottish smallpipes are normally bellows-blown like the Northumbrian smallpipes and Border pipes. The advantages of bellows-blown pipes, such as greater stability of tuning (due to smaller fluctuations in humidity and temperature of air across the reeds) and the possibility to sing or talk whilst playing make them by far the most popular variation, however mouth-blown smallpipes are fairly common.

The chanter is most commonly unkeyed, but occasionally keys are added, most often high B, G sharp, F natural, and C natural, to extend the range and/or give access to accidental notes. A second thumb hole may be added to the back of the chanter to play C natural. Though it would in principle be possible to add as many keys as seen on modern Northumbrian smallpipes, very few sets with more than 3 keys exist. Most music written for the instrument uses only the nine notes of its unkeyed range.

The drones, typically three in number, are set in a common stock and are usually tuned in one of two patterns. For pipes in A, the tenor drone is tuned to the low &quot;A&quot; of the chanter (the tonic), and the bass drone to the &quot;A&quot; an octave below this. There is often also a dominant drone - this can be either a baritone, tuned a fifth above the bass, or an alto drone, tuned a fifth above the tenor. For tunes played on the 4th (i.e. in D on an A chanter), the dominant drone can be either shut off or retuned to the fourth on the chanter. Most makers favour a baritone drone, rather than an alto, though some use only the bass and tenor. Some makers have developed drones compatible with both A and D chanters, so that one instrument can be used with either chanter. One example is the &quot;ADAD&quot; style, with bass, baritone, tenor, and alto, as seen here: With longer tuning slides or the addition of tuning beads (used widely on Northumbrian smallpipe drones), drones can easily be retuned to a pitch one or two tones higher. This allows for increased drone tuning options, meaning tunes can be played in the nominal keys of A Mixolydian, D major, B minor and by tuning down by a tone, in G. The use of longer tuning slides is also used to convert A and D drones to G and C drones (or vice versa), meaning the same set of drones can be played with chanters in D, C, A and G.

==History==

Originally one of the first documented bagpipes in Scotland, along with the Border pipes, smallpipes were popular in the Lowland areas of Scotland as far north as Aberdeen. Evidence shows them to have existed since the 15th century (Highland pipes can only be documented from the 15th Century in a form definably separate from Irish &quot;warpipes&quot;), when they were used for dancing and entertainment in court and castle, later they became popular amongst burgh pipers, and town minstrels until the early 19th Century, when the demise of the town pipers led to their disappearing from the record. Being bellows-blown this made them suitable for playing for long periods. Bellows-blown smallpipes are believed to have entered Scotland via England, and the continent of Europe, examples are preserved in many drawings, carvings, and paintings from 15th century onwards, and in Europe from the 12th century onwards. There is some discussion of the historical Scottish smallpipes in Collinson&#x27;s history of the bagpipes. More reliable research and information can be obtained in Hugh Cheape&#x27;s &quot;Bagpipes: A National Collection.&quot;

Since there was a break in the continuous playing tradition of the smallpipes, and Border pipes, no absolute, definitive playing style can be ascribed to them. However, according to the evidence provided by surviving manuscript collections of music written for these pipes (particular those of Dixon, Peacock, and Riddell), their style was built around variations, runs, and arpeggios, as opposed to the surviving Highland music which is dominated by stylised gracenote techniques.

Smallpipes are extremely popular with Highland pipers, many of whom use them, or a set of Border pipes, as a second instrument better suited to indoor playing, and play them according to the Highland tradition. Though it has somewhat supplanted the musically unsatisfactory Highland practice chanter as a relatively quiet rehearsal instrument for Highland pipers, it has gained wide currency as a session instrument, playing both the Highland and lowland (border) repertoires.

The Scottish smallpipes were the first widely available instrument which allowed Highland pipers to participate in musical sessions with fiddlers, flautists and other instruments, as well as to accompany singers. Leading players include Hamish Moore, Iain MacInnes, Allan MacDonald, Gary West, Fred Morrison, Fin Moore, Brìghde Chaimbeul, Michael Roddy, Callum Armstrong, Ross Ainslie, Gordon Mooney, EJ Jones, Ailis Sutherland, Glenn Coolen, Barry Shears, as well as the late Martyn Bennett.

<doc id="246333" wikidata="Q174273" url="?curid=246333" title="Mayfly">
<text>Mayflies (also known as shadflies or fishflies in Canada and the upper Midwestern United States, as Canadian soldiers in the American Great Lakes region, and as up-winged flies in the United Kingdom) are aquatic insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera. This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the Palaeoptera, which also contains dragonflies and damselflies. Over 3,000 species of mayfly are known worldwide, grouped into over 400 genera in 42 families.

Mayflies have ancestral traits that were probably present in the first flying insects, such as long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen. Their immature stages are aquatic fresh water forms (called &quot;naiads&quot; or &quot;nymphs&quot;), whose presence indicates a clean, unpolluted and highly oxygenated aquatic environment. They are unique among insect orders in having a fully winged terrestrial preadult stage, the subimago, which moults into a sexually mature adult, the imago.

Mayflies &quot;hatch&quot; (emerge as adults) from spring to autumn, not necessarily in May, in enormous numbers. Some hatches attract tourists. Fly fishermen make use of mayfly hatches by choosing artificial fishing flies that resemble them. One of the most famous English mayflies is &quot;Rhithrogena germanica&quot;, the fisherman&#x27;s &quot;March brown mayfly&quot;.

The brief lives of mayfly adults have been noted by naturalists and encyclopaedists since Aristotle and Pliny the Elder in classical antiquity. The German engraver Albrecht Dürer included a mayfly in his 1495 engraving &quot;The Holy Family with the Mayfly&quot; to suggest a link between heaven and earth. The English poet George Crabbe compared the brief life of a daily newspaper with that of a mayfly in the satirical poem &quot;The Newspaper&quot; (1785), both being known as &quot;ephemera&quot;.

== Description ==

=== Nymph ===

Immature mayflies are aquatic and are referred to as nymphs or naiads. In contrast to their short lives as adults, they may live for several years in the water. They have an elongated, cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of instars (stages), moulting and increasing in size each time. When ready to emerge from the water, nymphs vary in length, depending on species, from . The head has a tough outer covering of sclerotin, often with various hard ridges and projections; it points either forwards or downwards, with the mouth at the front. There are two large compound eyes, three ocelli (simple eyes) and a pair of antennae of variable lengths, set between or in front of the eyes. The mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap-like labrum, a pair of strong mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a membranous hypopharynx and a labium.

The thorax consists of three segments – the hindmost two, the mesothorax and metathorax, being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the mesothorax, and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the metathorax.

The abdomen consists of ten segments, some of which may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in slender thread-like projections, consisting of a pair of cerci, with or without a third central caudal filament.

===Subimago===
The final moult of the nymph is not to the full adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that physically resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago, or dun, often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs known as microtrichia; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Females of some mayflies (subfamily Palingeniinae) do not moult from a subimago state into an adult stage and are sexually mature while appearing like a subimago with microtrichia on the wing membrane. Oligoneuriine mayflies form another exception in retaining microtrichia on their wings but not on their bodies. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, have shorter appendages, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. In males of &quot;Ephoron leukon&quot;, the subimagos have forelegs that are short and compressed, with accordion like folds, and expands to more than double its length after moulting. After a period, usually lasting one or two days but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.

=== Imago ===

Adult mayflies, or imagos, are relatively primitive in structure, exhibiting traits that were probably present in the first flying insects. These include long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen. Mayflies are delicate-looking insects with one or two pairs of membranous, triangular wings, which are extensively covered with veins. At rest, the wings are held upright, like those of a butterfly. The hind wings are much smaller than the forewings and may be vestigial or absent. The second segment of the thorax, which bears the forewings, is enlarged to hold the main flight muscles. Adults have short, flexible antennae, large compound eyes, three ocelli and non-functional mouthparts. In most species, the males&#x27; eyes are large and the front legs unusually long, for use in locating and grasping females during the mid-air mating. In the males of some families, there are two large cylindrical &quot;turban&quot; eyes (also known as &quot;turbanate&quot; or &quot;turbinate&quot; eyes) that face upwards in addition to the lateral eyes. They are capable of detecting ultraviolet light and are thought to be used during courtship to detect females flying above them. In some species all the legs are functionless, apart from the front pair in males. The abdomen is long and roughly cylindrical, with ten segments and two or three long cerci (tail-like appendages) at the tip. Like Entognatha, Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, the spiracles on the abdomen do not have closing muscles. Uniquely among insects, mayflies possess paired genitalia, with the male having two aedeagi (penis-like organs) and the female two gonopores (sexual openings).

== Biology ==

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===

Mayflies are hemimetabolous (they have &quot;incomplete metamorphosis&quot;). They are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings; this last-but-one winged (alate) instar usually lives a very short time and is known as a subimago, or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them. The subimago stage does not survive for long, rarely for more than 24 hours. In some species, it may last for just a few minutes, while the mayflies in the family Palingeniidae have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all.

Often, all the individuals in a population mature at once (a hatch), and for a day or two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are extremely abundant, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. &quot;Baetis intercalaris&quot;, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual&#x27;s risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed and have only vestigial mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. &quot;Dolania americana&quot; has the shortest adult lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.

Male adults may patrol individually, but most congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial or courtship dance. Each insect has a characteristic up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating takes place in the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to their dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.

Females typically lay between four hundred and three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped onto the surface of the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.

Around half of all mayfly species whose reproductive biology has been described are parthenogenetic (able to asexually reproduce), including both partially and exclusively parthenogenetic populations and species.

Many species breed in moving water, where there is a tendency for the eggs and nymphs to get washed downstream. To counteract this, females may fly upriver before depositing their eggs. For example, the female Tisza mayfly, the largest European species with a length of , flies up to upstream before depositing eggs on the water surface. These sink to the bottom and hatch after 45 days, the nymphs burrowing their way into the sediment where they spend two or three years before hatching into subimagos.

When ready to emerge, several different strategies are used. In some species, the transformation of the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent for a minute or two resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.

===Ecology===
Nymphs live primarily in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, but they are among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of &quot;Hexagenia&quot; was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which &quot;Ephemera vulgata&quot; burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.

In most species, the nymphs are herbivores or detritivores, feeding on algae, diatoms or detritus, but in a few species, they are predators of chironomid and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of &quot;Povilla&quot; burrow into submerged wood and can be a problem for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with caddisfly larvae and gastropod molluscs, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has a significant impact on the primary producers, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.

The nymphs are eaten by a wide range of predators and form an important part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs&#x27; growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects, such as &quot;Rhamphomyia longicauda&quot;.

Mayfly nymphs may serve as hosts for parasites such as nematodes and trematodes. Some of these affect the nymphs&#x27; behaviour in such a way that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as intermediate hosts for the horsehair worm &quot;Paragordius varius&quot;, which causes its definitive host, a grasshopper, to jump into water and drown.

==== Effects on ecosystem functioning ====

Mayflies are involved in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the mayfly genus &quot;Centroptilum&quot; increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats through the process of bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing to the bottom of the lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus &quot;Isonychia&quot;. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.

=== Distribution ===

Mayflies are distributed all over the world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropical realm, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.

== Conservation ==

The nymph is the dominant life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible to a number of pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.

The threat to mayflies applies also to their eggs. &quot;Modest levels&quot; of pollution in rivers in England are sufficient to kill 80% of mayfly eggs, which are as vulnerable to pollutants as other life-cycle stages; numbers of the blue-winged olive mayfly (&quot;Baetis&quot;) have fallen dramatically, almost to none in some rivers. The major pollutants thought to be responsible are fine sediment and phosphate from agriculture and sewage.

The status of many species of mayflies is unknown because they are known from only the original collection data. Four North American species are believed to be extinct. Among these, &quot;Pentagenia robusta&quot; was originally collected from the Ohio River near Cincinnati, but this species has not been seen since its original collection in the 1800s. &quot;Ephemera compar&quot; is known from a single specimen, collected from the &quot;foothills of Colorado&quot; in 1873, but despite intensive surveys of the Colorado mayflies reported in 1984, it has not been rediscovered.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species includes one mayfly: &quot;Tasmanophlebia lacuscoerulei&quot;, the large blue lake mayfly, which is a native of Australia and is listed as endangered because its alpine habitat is vulnerable to climate change.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

Ephemeroptera was defined by Alpheus Hyatt and Jennie Maria Arms Sheldon in 1890–1. The taxonomy of the Ephemeroptera was reworked by George F. Edmunds and Jay R Traver, starting in 1954. Traver contributed to the 1935 work &quot;The Biology of Mayflies&quot;, and has been called &quot;the first Ephemeroptera specialist in North America&quot;.

As of 2012, over 3,000 species of mayfly in 42 families and over 400 genera are known worldwide, including about 630 species in North America. Mayflies are an ancient group of winged (pterygote) insects. Putative fossil stem group representatives (e.g. Syntonopteroidea-like &quot;Lithoneura lameerrei&quot;) are already known from the late Carboniferous. The name Ephemeroptera is from the Greek ἐφήμερος, &#x27; &quot;short-lived&quot; (literally &quot;lasting a day&quot;, cf. English &quot;ephemeral&quot;), and πτερόν, &#x27;, &quot;wing&quot;, referring to the brief lifespan of adults. The English common name is for the insect&#x27;s emergence in or around the month of May in the UK. The name shadfly is from the Atlantic fish the shad, which runs up American East Coast rivers at the same time as many mayflies emerge.

From the Permian, numerous stem group representatives of mayflies are known, which are often lumped into a separate taxon Permoplectoptera (e.g. including &quot;Protereisma permianum&quot; in the Protereismatidae, and Misthodotidae). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family Cretereismatidae from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family Mickoleitiidae (order Coxoplectoptera) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, even though they had very peculiar adaptations such as raptorial forelegs.

The oldest mayfly inclusion in amber is &quot;Cretoneta zherichini&quot; (Leptophlebiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of Siberia. In the much younger Baltic amber numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies have been found (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus &quot;Neoephemera&quot; is represented in the fossil record by the Ypresian species &quot;N. antiqua&quot; from Washington state.

Grimaldi and Engel, reviewing the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many cladistic studies had been made with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was wrong because Pannota is derived from the Schistonota.
The phylogeny of the Ephemeroptera was first studied using molecular analysis by Ogden and Whiting in 2005. They recovered the Baetidae as sister to the other clades.
Mayfly phylogeny was further studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden and others in 2009. They found that the Asian genus &quot;Siphluriscus&quot; was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be monophyletic, through convergence among nymphal features.

The following traditional classification, with two suborders Pannota and Schistonota, was introduced in 1979 by W. P. McCafferty and George F. Edmunds. The list is based on Peters and Campbell (1991), in &quot;Insects of Australia&quot;.

==In human culture==

===In art===

The Dutch Golden Age author Augerius Clutius (Outgert Cluyt) illustrated some mayflies in his 1634 &quot;De Hemerobio&quot; (&quot;On the Mayfly&quot;), the earliest book written on the group. Maerten de Vos similarly illustrated a mayfly in his 1587 depiction of the fifth day of creation, amongst an assortment of fish and water birds.

In 1495 Albrecht Dürer included a mayfly in his engraving &quot;The Holy Family with the Mayfly&quot;. The critics Larry Silver and Pamela H. Smith argue that the image provides &quot;an explicit link between heaven and earth ... to suggest a cosmic resonance between sacred and profane, celestial and terrestrial, macrocosm and microcosm.&quot;

=== In literature ===

The Ancient Greek biologist and philosopher Aristotle wrote in his &quot;History of Animals&quot; that

The Ancient Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder described the mayfly as the &quot;hemerobius&quot; in his &quot;Natural History&quot;:

The Roman lawyer Cicero wrote philosophically of them in his Tusculan Disputations: 

In his 1789 book &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot;, Gilbert White described in the entry for &quot;June 10th, 1771&quot; how

The mayfly has come to symbolise the transitoriness and brevity of life. The English poet George Crabbe, known to have been interested in insects, compared the brief life of a newspaper with that of mayflies, both being known as &quot;Ephemera&quot;, things that live for a day:

The theme of brief life is echoed in the artist Douglas Florian&#x27;s 1998 poem, &quot;The Mayfly&quot;. The American Poet Laureate Richard Wilbur&#x27;s 2005 poem &quot;Mayflies&quot; includes the lines &quot;I saw from unseen pools a mist of flies, In their quadrillions rise, And animate a ragged patch of glow, With sudden glittering&quot;.

Another literary reference to mayflies is seen in &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, one of the earliest surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh&#x27;s life is compared to that of the adult mayfly. In Szeged, Hungary, mayflies are celebrated in a monument near the Belvárosi bridge, the work of local sculptor Pal Farkas, depicting the courtship dance of mayflies. The American playwright David Ives wrote a short comedic play, &quot;Time Flies&quot;, in 2001, as to what two mayflies might discuss during their one day of existence.

=== In fly fishing ===

Mayflies are the primary source of models for artificial flies, hooks tied with coloured materials such as threads and feathers, used in fly fishing. These are based on different life-cycle stages of mayflies. For example, the flies known as &quot;emergers&quot; in North America are designed by fly fishermen to resemble subimago mayflies, and are intended to lure freshwater trout. In 1983, Patrick McCafferty recorded that artificial flies had been based on 36 genera of North American mayfly, from a total of 63 western species and 103 eastern/central species. A large number of these species have common names among fly fishermen, who need to develop a substantial knowledge of mayfly &quot;habitat, distribution, seasonality, morphology and behavior&quot; in order to match precisely the look and movements of the insects that the local trout are expecting.

Izaak Walton describes the use of mayflies for catching trout in his 1653 book &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;; for example, he names the &quot;Green-drake&quot; for use as a natural fly, and &quot;duns&quot; (mayfly subimagos) as artificial flies. These include for example the &quot;Great Dun&quot; and the &quot;Great Blue Dun&quot; in February; the &quot;Whitish Dun&quot; in March; the &quot;Whirling Dun&quot; and the &quot;Yellow Dun&quot; in April; the &quot;Green-drake&quot;, the &quot;Little Yellow May-Fly&quot; and the &quot;Grey-Drake&quot; in May; and the &quot;Black-Blue Dun&quot; in July. Nymph or &quot;wet fly&quot; fishing was restored to popularity on the chalk streams of England by G. E. M. Skues with his 1910 book &quot;Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream&quot;. In the book, Skues discusses the use of duns to catch trout. The March brown is &quot;probably the most famous of all British mayflies&quot;, having been copied by anglers to catch trout for over 500 years.

Some English public houses beside trout streams such as the River Test in Hampshire are named &quot;The Mayfly&quot;.

=== As a spectacle ===

The hatch of the giant mayfly &quot;Palingenia longicauda&quot; on the Tisza and Maros Rivers in Hungary and Serbia, known as &quot;Tisza blooming&quot;, is a tourist attraction. The 2014 hatch of the large black-brown mayfly &quot;Hexagenia bilineata&quot; on the Mississippi River in the US was imaged on weather radar; the swarm flew up to 760 m (2,500 feet) above the ground near La Crosse, Wisconsin, creating a radar signature that resembled a &quot;significant rain storm&quot;, and the mass of dead insects covering roads, cars and buildings caused a &quot;slimy mess&quot;.

During the weekend of 13–14 June 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several vehicular accidents on the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions posed by piles of dead insects.

===As food ===

Mayflies are consumed in several cultures and are estimated to contain the most raw protein content of any edible insect by dry weight. In Malawi, kungu, a paste of mayflies (&quot;Caenis kungu&quot;) and mosquitoes is made into a cake for eating. Adult mayflies are collected and eaten in many parts of China and Japan. Near Lake Victoria, &quot;Povilla&quot; mayflies are collected, dried and preserved for use in food preparations. 

=== As a name for ships and aircraft ===

&quot;Mayfly&quot; was the crew&#x27;s nickname for His Majesty&#x27;s Airship No. 1, an aerial scout airship built by Vickers but wrecked by strong winds in 1911 before her trial flights.

Two vessels of the Royal Navy were named : a torpedo boat launched in January 1907, and a &quot;Fly&quot;-class river gunboat constructed in sections at Yarrow in 1915.

The Seddon Mayfly, which was constructed in 1908, was an aircraft that was unsuccessful in early flight. The first aircraft designed by a woman, Lillian Bland, was titled the Bland Mayfly.

===Other human uses===

In pre-1950s France, &quot;chute de manne&quot; was obtained by pressing mayflies into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait. From an economic standpoint, mayflies also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish. Mayflies could find uses in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Their exoskeleton contains chitin, which has applications in these industries.

Research on genome expression in the mayfly &quot;Cloeon dipterum,&quot; has provided ideas on the evolution of the insect wing and giving support to the so-called gill theory which suggests that the ancestral insect wing may have evolved from larval gills of aquatic insects like mayflies.

Mayfly larvae do not survive in polluted aquatic habitats and, thus, have been chosen as bioindicators, markers of water quality in ecological assessments.

In marketing, Nike produced a line of running shoes in 2003 titled &quot;Mayfly&quot;. The shoes were designed with a wing venation pattern like the mayfly and were also said to have a finite lifetime. The telecommunication company Vodafone featured mayflies in a 2006 branding campaign, telling consumers to &quot;make the most of now&quot;.

<doc id="246341" wikidata="Q270983" url="?curid=246341" title="Kinkaku-ji">
<text>, officially named , is a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan and a tourist attraction. It is designated as a World Heritage Site, a National Special Historic Site, a National Special Landscape, and one of the 17 Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto. The temple is nicknamed after its reliquary (&quot;shariden&quot;), the , whose top two floors are coated in 0.5 μm gold leaf. The current pavilion was rebuilt in 1955 after being destroyed in an arson attack.

==History==

The site of Kinkaku-ji was originally a villa called &quot;Kitayama-dai&quot; (北山第), belonging to a powerful statesman, Saionji Kintsune. Kinkaku-ji&#x27;s history dates to 1397, when the villa was purchased from the Saionji family by &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and transformed into the Kinkaku-ji complex. When Yoshimitsu died the building was converted into a Zen temple by his son, according to his wishes.
The original Golden Pavilion is believed to have been constructed in 1399. Gold was an important addition to the pavilion because of its underlying meaning. The gold employed was intended to mitigate and purify any pollution or negative thoughts and feelings towards death. Other than the symbolic meaning behind the gold leaf, the Muromachi period heavily relied on visual excesses. With the focus on the Golden Pavilion, the way that the structure is mainly covered in that material creates an impression that stands out because of the sunlight reflecting and the effect the reflection creates on the pond.

During the Ōnin war (1467–1477), all of the buildings in the complex aside from the pavilion were burned down.

On 2 July 1950, at 2:30 am, the pavilion was burned down by a 22-year-old novice monk, Hayashi Yoken (), who then attempted suicide on the Daimon-ji hill behind the building. He survived, and was subsequently taken into custody. The monk was sentenced to seven years in prison, but was released because of mental illnesses (persecution complex and schizophrenia) on 29 September 1955; he died of tuberculosis in March 1956. During the fire, the original statue of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was lost to the flames (now restored). A fictionalized version of these events is at the center of Yukio Mishima&#x27;s 1956 book &quot;The Temple of the Golden Pavilion&quot;, and another in the ballet &quot;RAkU&quot;.

The present pavilion structure dates from 1955, when it was rebuilt. The pavilion is three stories high, in height. The reconstruction is said to be a close copy of the original, although some have questioned whether such an extensive gold-leaf coating was used on the original structure. In 1984, it was discovered that the gold leaf on the reconstructed building had peeled off, and from 1986 to 1987, it was replaced with 0.5 μm gold leaf weighing 20 kg, five times the thickness and ten times the weight of the original. Although Japanese gold leaf has become thinner with the passage of time due to improved technology, the 0.5 μm gold leaf is as thick as traditional Japanese gold leaf. The interior of the building, including the paintings and Yoshimitsu&#x27;s statue, were also restored. The roof was restored in 2003.

==Design details==
The is a three-story building on the grounds of the Rokuon-ji temple complex. The top two stories of the pavilion are covered with pure gold leaf. The pavilion functions as a &quot;shariden&quot; (舎利殿), housing relics of the Buddha (Buddha&#x27;s Ashes). The building was an important model for Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion Temple) and Shōkoku-ji, which are also located in Kyoto. When these buildings were constructed, Ashikaga Yoshimasa employed the styles used at Kinkaku-ji and even borrowed the names of its second and third floors.

===Architectural design===
The pavilion successfully incorporates three distinct styles of architecture, which are shinden, samurai and zen, specifically on each floor. Each floor of the Kinkaku uses a different architectural style.

The first floor, called &quot;The Chamber of Dharma Waters&quot; (法水院, Hō-sui-in), is rendered in &quot;shinden-zukuri&quot; style, reminiscent of the residential style of the 11th century Heian imperial aristocracy. It is evocative of the Shinden palace style. It is designed as an open space with adjacent verandas and uses natural, unpainted wood and white plaster. This helps to emphasize the surrounding landscape. The walls and fenestration also affect the views from inside the pavilion. Most of the walls are made of shutters that can vary the amount of light and air into the pavilion and change the view by controlling the shutters&#x27; heights. The second floor, called &quot;The Tower of Sound Waves&quot; (潮音洞, Chō-on-dō ), is built in the style of warrior aristocrats, or &quot;buke-zukuri&quot;. On this floor, sliding wood doors and latticed windows create a feeling of impermanence. The second floor also contains a Buddha Hall and a shrine dedicated to the goddess of mercy, Kannon. The third floor is built in traditional Chinese &quot;chán&quot; (Jpn. zen) style, also known as &quot;zenshū-butsuden-zukuri&quot;. It is called the &quot;Cupola of the Ultimate&quot; (究竟頂, Kukkyō-chō). The zen typology depicts a more religious ambiance in the pavilion, as was popular during the Muromachi period.

The roof is in a thatched pyramid with shingles. The building is topped with a bronze &quot;hōō&quot; (phoenix) ornament. From the outside, viewers can see gold plating added to the upper stories of the pavilion. The gold leaf covering the upper stories hints at what is housed inside: the shrines. The outside is a reflection of the inside. The elements of nature, death, religion, are formed together to create this connection between the pavilion and outside intrusions.

===Garden design===
The Golden Pavilion is set in a Japanese . The location implements the idea of borrowing of scenery (&quot;shakkei&quot;) that integrates the outside and the inside, creating an extension of the views surrounding the pavilion and connecting it with the outside world. The pavilion extends over a pond, called , that reflects the building. The pond contains 10 smaller islands. The zen typology is seen through the rock composition; the bridges and plants are arranged in a specific way to represent famous places in Chinese and Japanese literature. Vantage points and focal points were established because of the strategic placement of the pavilion to view the gardens surrounding the pavilion. A small or roofed deck is attached to the rear of the pavilion building, allowing a small boat to be moored under it. The pavilion grounds were built according to descriptions of the Western Paradise of the Buddha Amida, intending to illustrate a harmony between heaven and earth. The largest islet in the pond represents the Japanese islands. The four stones forming a straight line in the pond near the pavilion are intended to represent sailboats anchored at night, bound for the &quot;Isle of Eternal Life&quot; in Chinese mythology.

The garden complex is an excellent example of Muromachi period garden design. The Muromachi period is considered to be a classical age of Japanese garden design. The correlation between buildings and its settings were greatly emphasized during this period. It was an artistic way to integrate the structure within the landscape. The garden designs were characterized by a reduction in scale, a more central purpose, and a distinct setting. A minimalistic approach was brought to the garden design by recreating larger landscapes in a smaller scale around a structure.

<doc id="246345" wikidata="Q652470" url="?curid=246345" title="Border pipes">
<text>The border pipes are a type of bagpipe related to the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe. It is perhaps confusable with the Scottish smallpipe, although it is a quite different and much older instrument. Although most modern Border pipes are closely modelled on similar historic instruments, the modern Scottish smallpipes are a modern reinvention, inspired by historic instruments but largely based on Northumbrian smallpipes in their construction.

The name, which is modern, refers to the Anglo-Scottish Border region, where the instrument was once common, so much so that many towns there used to maintain a piper. The instrument was found much more widely than this, however; it was noted as far north as Aberdeenshire, south of the Border in Northumberland and elsewhere in the north of England. Indeed, some late 17th-century paintings, such as a tavern scene by Egbert van Heemskerck, probably from south-eastern England, show musicians playing such instruments. Other names have been used for the instrument: &quot;Lowland pipes&quot; and &quot;reel pipes&quot; in Scotland, and &quot;half-long pipes&quot; in Northumberland and Durham. However, the term &quot;reel pipes&quot; historically refers to instruments similar to Highland pipes, but primarily intended for indoor use.

While the instrument had been widespread in the 18th century, by the late 19th century it was no longer played. There was an attempted revival in north-east England in the 1920s and new instruments were created for Newcastle Royal Grammar School, Durham University OTC, and Northumberland Boy Scouts. The term &quot;half-long pipes&quot; is now used to refer specifically to surviving Northumbrian examples from this period; these were in part modelled on an 18th-century set which had belonged to Muckle Jock Milburn, and is now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum; however, they were given a different drone configuration.

== Description ==
The instrument consists of a &quot;chanter&quot; which plays the melody, &quot;drones&quot; which play a constant unchanging harmony, a bag which holds the air to blow drones and chanter, and a set of bellows to supply air to the bag.
An early photograph from Northumberland, c. 1859, shows the instrument well.

===Chanter===
The instrument has a conical-bored chanter, in contrast to the cylindrically-bored Scottish smallpipe. The modern instruments are louder than the Scottish smallpipe, though not as loud as the Great Highland Bagpipe; they blend well with stringed instruments.

The chanter has a thumb hole and seven finger-holes. The compass of the chanter is nine notes, from G to a, though a few higher notes, typically b, c&#x27;,and c#&#x27;, are obtainable on some chanters by &#x27;pinching&#x27; and overblowing. As with the Highland pipes, the basic scale is a mixolydian scale on A. Some chanters can play chromatic notes however, and some old tunes, for instance &quot;Bold Wilkinson&quot; or &quot;Wat ye what I got late yestreen&quot;, suggest a dorian scale may also sometimes have been used, requiring a minor third instead of the major third of the mixolydian scale. This could be achieved by cross-fingering or half-holing. Pete Stewart has further argued that the existence of some G major tunes with a nine-note compass from G to a suggests that Border pipes formerly sounded a c natural, rather than c sharp; cross-fingering would then have been needed to sound a c sharp.

Some instruments are made in other pitches, typically B flat or G, rather than A.

===Drones===
The instrument has three cylindrically bored drones inserted into the pipebag by a common stock, typically tuned A, a, e&#x27;, or A, a, a. In contrast, the Great Highland Bagpipe has each drone in a separate stock. The drone tuning A, e, a was used in half-long pipes in the early 20th century, and though still rare, sets are now beginning to be made with this drone tuning again.

===Bag and bellows===
The bag is not filled with breath from the player&#x27;s mouth, but instead is supplied with dry air, from a set of bellows strapped under the player&#x27;s right arm. This keeps the reeds drier, which helps keep the instrument in tune, as well as greatly extending the life of a reed.

== Border pipe repertoire ==
There is a distinct body of music for the instrument – many of these tunes survived in the fiddle and Northumbrian smallpipes repertoire after the playing of Border pipes died out in the mid-19th century. Others survive in manuscript sources from the 18th and 19th century.

=== Sources ===
Most notably, the William Dixon manuscript, dated 1733, from Stamfordham in Northumberland, was identified as Border pipe music by Matt Seattle in 1995, and published by him with extensive notes.

The book contains forty tunes, almost all with extensive variation sets. Some of these are limited to a single octave, and many of this group correspond closely to tunes for Northumbrian smallpipes known from early 19th-century sources – &quot;Apprentice Lads of Alnwick&quot; is one of these; others are melodically and harmonically richer – using the full nine-note compass and the G major subtonic chord – a fine example of this group is &quot;Dorrington&quot;. Another very early, though limited, source is George Skene&#x27;s manuscript fiddle book of 1715, from Aberdeenshire. Besides settings for fiddle, some playable on the pipes, it contains four pieces explicitly stated to be in bagpipe style, all variation sets on Lowland tunes.

Another limited early 18th-century source, is Thomas Marsden&#x27;s 1705 collection of Lancashire Hornpipes, for fiddle; one clear example of a pipe tune here is &quot;Mr Preston&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, with a characteristic nine-note compass. Significantly, this tune is in the Dorian mode on A, with C natural throughout, rather than the Mixolydian mode of the Dixon tunes.

Several Border pipe tunes, including &quot;The English Black and the Grey&quot;, &quot;Bold Wilkinson&quot; and &quot;Galloping over the Cowhill&quot;, were copied in the 19th century by John Stokoe from the mid-18th century John Smith MS, from Northumberland, dated 1753. This manuscript was, from 1881, the property of Lewis Proudlock, who showed it to Stokoe, but it has since been lost. Some tunes in James Oswald&#x27;s &quot;Caledonian Pocket Companion&quot;, also from the mid-18th century, ostensibly for flute or violin, are identifiable as Border pipe tunes. Another important source is the Vickers fiddle manuscript from Northumberland – many tunes in this have the characteristic nine-note compass of pipe tunes.

A later Scottish source, from the early 19th century, is Robert Riddell&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes&quot; – besides some tunes for fiddle and some for smallpipes, others, such as &quot;Torphichen&#x27;s Rant&quot;, clearly have the range and the idiom of Border pipe tunes. The smallpipe manuscript of Robert Bewick of Gateshead, besides many smallpipe tunes and transcribed fiddle tunes, contains several nine-note tunes, now identified as Border pipe music. Some of the smallpipe tunes in Peacock&#x27;s book, from the early 19th century, are in the Lydian mode, with a tonic of c, but with one sharp in the key signature; these – &quot;Bobby Shaftoe&quot; is one – make more musical sense in the major mode with an f natural, viewed as adaptations from originals for Border pipes. The Peacock, John Smith and some of the Bewick tunes are reproduced in the FARNE archive.

=== Stylistic features ===
These tunes display several features distinguishing them from music for fiddle, Northumbrian pipes and Highland pipes. The nine-note modal scale, usually mixolydian, with a compass from the subtonic up to the high tonic, separates them clearly from most fiddle and smallpipe tunes. In particular, the interval of an augmented fourth, difficult on the fiddle, is much more common in these tunes. The compass of fiddle tunes is generally wider, while the older smallpipe tunes have an eight-note range from the tonic up to an octave higher. One complication is the long tradition in Scotland of writing tunes to be played on the fiddle, but &#x27;in bagpipe style&#x27;, often with the strings retuned to imitate drones; 18th century examples of these can fit well on Border pipes, and may well have been intended as imitations of this instrument.

Further, an important difference between the music of the Border pipes and of the Great Highland bagpipe is that many melodic figures in older Border pipe music typically move stepwise or in thirds rather than by wide intervals, and lack the multiple repeated notes found in many Highland pipe tunes. This suggests that in contrast to the Highland pipes, Border pipe music neither needed, nor greatly used, the complex graces which are so characteristic of Highland pipe music. The four specifically named pipe tunes from Skene&#x27;s manuscript contain complex written-out gracings, and many more repeated notes than the Dixon tunes, so it is reasonable to conclude that playing styles in the 18th century varied from place to place. Modern attempts to reconstruct a musically valid playing style for Border music such as the Dixon tunes have been very successful, and several respected pipers play in such styles.
These are characterised by simple gracings, used sparingly, mostly either for rhythmic emphasis or to separate repeated notes.

== Border pipes outside of Border music ==
The Border pipes have been taken up by many groups of pipers who were looking for a suitable instrument with which to play their music. This has not just been by musicians who play the music of the Scottish borders. For example, in Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, the instrument is used by highland pipers to play along with fiddles and other softer instruments. As the modern instrument is still fairly newly revived, ideas on playing styles are still evolving and naturally depend on the kind of music being played.

==Musical societies==
The Lowland and Border Pipers&#x27; Society was formed in 1982 and has played a large part in the revival of the instrument and its music. 
In the North East, the Northumbrian Pipers&#x27; Society has played a similar role for both Border pipes and Northumbrian smallpipes.
The instrument is now once again widely played, and the original Border repertoire for the instrument, particularly the Dixon tunes, is becoming better known.

<text>The Galician gaita (, , ) is the traditional instrument of Galicia and northern Portugal.

The word is used across northern Spain as a generic term for &quot;bagpipe&quot;, although in the south of Spain and Portugal it denotes a variety of horn, flute or oboe like instruments according to region.

== Etymology ==
There are many suggestions as to the origin of the name . It has been compared to the names of eastern European bagpipes, such as the Bulgarian &quot;kaba gaida&quot; and the Slovak (plurale tantum). The linguist Joan Coromines has suggested that the word most likely derived from a Gothic word or , meaning &quot;goat&quot;; as the bag of a gaita is made from a whole, case-skinned goat hide. Gothic was spoken in Hispania from the fifth century to the eighth century when the country was ruled by the Visigoths. The Visigoths originated in north-eastern Europe.

== The instrument ==

The Galician gaita has a conical chanter and a bass drone () with a second octave. It may have one or two additional drones playing the tonic and dominant notes. Three keys are traditional: D (, lit. &quot;cricket bagpipe&quot;), C (), and B♭ (). Galician pipe bands playing these instruments have become popular in recent years.

The playing of close harmony (thirds and sixths) with two gaitas of the same key is a typical Galician gaita style.

The bagpipe or gaita is known to have been popular in the Middle Ages, as early as the 9th century, but suffered a decline in popularity from the 16th century until a 19th-century revival. It saw another decline in the middle of the 20th century when the Francoist dictatorship tried to use it for propaganda purposes. Then, beginning in about the 1970s, a roots revival heralded another rebirth. The folk revival may have peaked in the late 1990s, with the release of acclaimed albums by Galician Carlos Núñez ().

The gaita began to gain popularity with the massive immigration of Galicians to the United States and Latin America. The foundations of Galician Centers ( / ) in key cities and capitals, from New York City to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Traditional use include both solo performances or with a snare-drum known as (a wooden natural-skinned drum with gut snares), and the , a bass drum.

===Description===
The player inflates the bag using his mouth through a tube fitted with a non-return valve. Air is driven into the chanter () with the left arm controlling the pressure inside the bag. The chanter has a double reed similar to a shawm or oboe, and a conical bore with seven finger-holes on the front. The bass drone ( or ) is situated on the player&#x27;s left shoulder and is pitched two octaves below the key note of the chanter; it has a single reed. Some bagpipes have up to two more drones, including the or , which sticks out from the bag and plays an octave above the , or the smaller . These two extra drones are located next to the right arm of the player.

The finger-holes include three for the left hand and four for the right, as well as one at the back for the left thumb. The chanter&#x27;s tonic is played with the top six holes and the thumb hole covered by fingers. Starting at the bottom and (in the Galician fingering pattern) progressively opening holes creates the diatonic scale. Using techniques like cross-fingering and half-holing, the chromatic scale can be created. With extra pressure on the bag, the reed can be played in a second octave, thus giving range of an octave and a half from tonic to top note. It is also possible to close the tone hole with the little finger of the right hand, thus creating a semitone below the tonic.

===Songs===
Tunes using the gaita are usually songs, with the voice either accompanying the instrumentation or taking turns with it.

The most common type is the , a sprightly 6/8 rhythm. Other 6/8 Galician tunes use different steps; they include the , , , and .

, usually-instrumental tune, most often in 2/4, though sometimes 3/4, and is characterized by a series of descending turning phrases. It is used to begin a day&#x27;s celebrations, and is played at sunrise.

The is a joyful 3/4 jota-type song, often played at (community gatherings at a local shrine).

<doc id="246347" wikidata="Q13884" url="?curid=246347" title="Southern Leyte">
<text>Southern Leyte (; Kabalian: &quot;Habagatan nga Leyte&quot;; ; ), officially the Province of Southern Leyte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Eastern Visayas region. Its capital and largest city is Maasin. Southern Leyte comprised the third congressional district Leyte until it was made into an independent province in 1959. Southern Leyte includes Limasawa, an island to the south where the first Roman Catholic Mass in Philippine soil is believed to have taken place and thus considered to be the birthplace of Roman Catholicism in the Philippines.

The province ranks as the second least populated in the region, after the province of Biliran. According to the 2020 census, the province has a population of 429,573.

Southern Leyte&#x27;s geological features created several issues in the province after the flooding of the Subangdaku River and the 2006 mudslide in Guinsaugon. Organizations warned the province it was susceptible to natural occurrences like landslides and floods.

Southern Leyte forms an important part of the inter-island transportation system of the country, with ferries transporting people and goods between Liloan and Surigao del Norte in Mindanao. The province is well known for its quality abaca products and is the country&#x27;s major producer of abaca fiber.

In September 2017, Representative Roger Mercado authored House Bill 6408, proposing to change the name of the province to Leyte del Sur.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

The province, being part of Leyte island, is believed to be influenced by &quot;Datu Et&quot;e, ruler of the historic community of Mairete, meaning &quot;Land of Ete&quot;, which was centered in Tacloban. The area which is to be Southern Leyte is believed to have been occupied by animist Visayan ethnic groups from Bohol. There is no proof that the indigenous animist Warays of Samar, who at the time occupied northeast Leyte, ever occupied Southern Leyte.

=== Spanish colonial era ===
As early as 1898 during the Spanish and American periods, there existed a &quot;sub-province&quot; consisting of the municipalities from Palompon to Hinunangan, with Maasin as the center. Some government offices had already been established in Maasin on the southwestern part of Leyte to govern the area.

Historically, the governing city was the depository of &quot;cedula&quot; tax collections from Palompon to Hinunangan. This was administered by the office of the &quot;Administrado de Hacienda&quot;, equivalent to the Provincial Treasurer, a position under the &quot;Secretario de Hacienda&quot;.

There was also established in Maasin a Court of First Instance, then known as the Promoter Fiscal, where all minor administrative and other cases from Palompon to Hinunangan were heard.

During the Spanish colonization, the province was sparsely populated. The continued raiding of Moro slaves discouraged the province from growing and developing. However, in the 19th century immigrants from adjacent provinces like Bohol and Cebu populated the area.

=== Japanese occupation era ===
In 1942, Ruperto Kangleon held a conference in the town of Sogod, when the first meeting attempt in Malitbog, a town to the east, failed due to many leaders staying away. He was trying to unify all guerrillas helping the Philippine Commonwealth troops during World War II.

From 1944 to 1945, the Allied Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers and Filipino guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial forces in an effort to liberate Southern Leyte, and American troops landed on Leyte on October 20, 1944.

=== Philippine independence ===
==== Independent province ====
Due to a change of sovereign powers, all the offices in Maasin except the Fiscal&#x27;s Office were abolished and reverted to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte. This created a major problem because of the dearth of transportation, the difficulty in managing the affairs of government in Tacloban and the language barrier between the Cebuano-speaking South-westerners and the Waray-speaking North-easterners. The difficulty of managing the entire island from the main city suggested a need to separate the island into two provinces.

At first there was a general movement for a &quot;Western Leyte&quot; and soon after, many prominent men and leaders rallied behind the movement. Six attempts to pass a law for the division of Leyte were made. On the sixth attempt, then Congressman Nicanor Yñiguez introduced into the House a division law similar in substance to that of the &quot;Kangleon Bill&quot;, but recognizing the impossibility of creating an East-West Division, he instead opted to make his own district a province.

Abandoning the first bill, Congressman Nicanor Yñiguez presented &quot;House Bill No. 1318&quot; proposing a new province of Southern Leyte comprising Third Congressional District of Leyte to include sixteen municipalities, from Maasin to Silago in the mainland, and in the Panaon Island.

The bill became &quot;Republic Act 2227&quot; otherwise known as an &quot;Act Creating the Province of Southern Leyte&quot; and was signed into Law by President Carlos P. Garcia on May 22, 1959. On July 1, 1960, Southern Leyte was inaugurated as a province with sixteen municipalities and Maasin as the capital town. Thus, the third District of Leyte became the &quot;Province of Southern Leyte&quot; and the Lone District of Southern Leyte.

===Contemporary===
==== Mudslides ====
In December 2003, a landslide in San Francisco, Southern Leyte destroyed most of the town, killing 200 people.


On February 17, 2006, several mudslides caused by heavy rains, amounting over , and a minor earthquake destroyed at least one town and many commercial and residential infrastructures, leaving hundreds dead. The municipality of Saint Bernard was one of the worst hit areas with 23 confirmed deaths, up to 200 estimated deaths and another 1,500 missing. Barangay Guinsaugon, a mountain village on the said municipality with 2,500 people, was almost completely destroyed, killing 1,800 of its 1,857 residents. Many rescuers from national and international responded to the incident. However, rescue efforts were greatly hampered by poor road conditions and lack of heavy equipment. Survivors also reported lack of coordination of rescue efforts. The few handful of Guinsaugon citizens which escaped the mudslide were put up in emergency shelters without adequate nutrition and care despite the National Government collecting millions of dollars worth of donations.

== Geography ==
Southern Leyte occupies the southern quarter of the island of Leyte. It is bounded by the province of Leyte to the north, by Surigao Strait to the east, Bohol Sea to the south, and Canigao Channel, across from Bohol, to the west. Its total land area is . The central portion of the province is dominated by the Sogod Bay, a long bay that cuts deep into the island.

=== Topography ===
Southern Leyte is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal areas where population centers lie, but rugged mountains towards the interior.

The province has inland water features. Based on national data, the province has altogether 93 rivers, including 18 major ones, namely the Amparo River in Macrohon, the Canturing River in Maasin, the Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in Hinunangan, the Divisoria River in Bontoc, the Hitungao and Lawigan Rivers in Saint Bernard, the Maag River in Silago, and the Subangdaku River in Sogod which is the biggest of all. The province has an inland lake called Lake Danao located in the mountains of San Juan and Anahawan, towns in the eastern region.

Subangdaku, the province&#x27;s largest river, created an issue over the area. It can be considered a braided river composed of several channels from near areas that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with a very wide floodplain. As such, the river usually became hazardous during typhoons after heavy rains. The river has overflowed, spilling its waters on the low-lying towns of Liloan and San Vicente and destroyed an ongoing flood control project worth millions of pesos. The river meanders along its course, ever changing its way over time. During the time it floods, it destroys every side of its course. In 2001, portions of the road and banks in Barangay San Miguel along the river were destroyed, including part of the Philippine National Road. Local officials blamed the rechannelization and uncontrolled quarrying of gravel and sand at the side of the river as the cause of the flood. At a meeting on March 18, 2002, one of the representatives of a government agency alleged that the reason of the incidents of flood and other environmental problems in the river was due to the &quot;Philippine Fault&quot; which caused rocks to rumble down. However, the reason was contended because the fault is a geological feature and environmental problems in the province just occurred that time.

Along with other mountain forms in the province, Mount Nacolod in Hinunangan town has the highest peak with an elevation of above sea level. Young volcanic rocks are discovered in the terrain areas, which cover the top of the southern mountain ranges of Mount Cabalian in the Pacific Area and Mount Nelangcapan in Panaon Area.

The province lies within the Philippine Fault System. The major fault lines traverse the municipalities of Sogod, Libagon, Saint Bernard and San Juan to Panaon Island. Based on Mines and Geosciences Bureau Region 8 data, these areas had experienced strong earthquakes in 1907 and 1948 with a magnitude of 6.9 and on July 5, 1984, with a 6.4 scale. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau warned that Southern Leyte&#x27;s natural and geological features make it susceptible to landslides and floodings. The affiliated group stated that there are four contributory reasons: unusually heavy rains; numerous faults and badly broken rocks; steep slopes; and absence of effective vegetative cover.

The province has numerous types of soil. Soil types within the Maasin Clay, Guimbalaon Clay, Himay-angan Clay, Bolinao Clay, Quingua Clay and Malitbog Clay series serve as raw materials for ceramics and pottery made by local residents.

=== Climate ===
Southern Leyte has two types of climate according to the Coronas Classification. These are Type II and Type IV.

Type II is characterized by the absence of dry season with a very pronounced maximum rain period occurring from November to January. This type prevails in the eastern half of the province that includes the municipality of Sogod, Libagon, Liloan, San Francisco, Pintuyan, San Ricardo, Saint Bernard, San Juan, Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan and Silago. On the other hand, Type IV has a rainfall that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. This type prevails in the western part of the province that includes the City of Maasin and the municipalities of Macrohon, Padre Burgos, Limasawa, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc and little part of Sogod.

== Demographics ==


The population of Southern Leyte in the 2020 census was 429,573 people, with a density of .

The 1980 national census recorded the province of Southern Leyte with a population of 296,294 from the historic record in 1903 of 72,369. In 1990, the population of the province increased to 321,940 which was caused by in-migration and increasing rate of birth over death. In 2000, population increased to 360,160 with a rate of 2.73 from the negative growth rate recorded in 1995 period with 317,565. The sudden decrease of the 1995 records was due to the late census in the province. While regular censuses were done in May where most of the students were at their respective places of residence, in 1995 the census of the population was done in September where the students were out for schooling in nearby provinces. The decrease in population was also, theoretically, attributed to out-migration of the rural population to cities to seek better employment and livelihood opportunities. A corresponding increase on the number of households was also recorded at 72,894 households higher by 7,327 households over the 1995 figure. Southern Leyte ranked fifth in terms of population among the six provinces in Eastern Visayas with 9.98 percent of the 3.6 million persons of the region. On the contrary, it was the fastest-growing province in the region. At the national level, the province contributed 0.47 percent to the total population of the Philippines with 76.5 million.

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the 2000 census survey, of the total provincial population of 359,738, about were Bisaya, Boholano, Cebuano, Tagalogs, and Waray.

In Panaon, an island situated in the southernmost part of the province, a certain aboriginal folk are found locally known as &quot;kongking&quot; or variously called &quot;mamanwa&quot; which means &quot;mountain people&quot;. They were believed to be migrants from Mindanao, inhabiting the portions of Agusan, after their migration from the island to evade militarization and the logging/mining corporations’ intrusion to their ancestral domains in the early 1980s. They have a dark complexion and curly hair, and they are short in stature. Hunting and gathering, mat weaving and rattan craft are among the main economic activities of the &quot;Mamanwas&quot;, so they prefer to inhabit the forested areas in the newfound Southern Leyte mountains. However, they were again displaced by the recent landslides in the province.

=== Language ===
The native language is a Boholano dialect variant of Cebuano. Waray is sometimes spoken (concentrated in some barrios near Waray speaking towns such as Abuyog and Mahaplag), while Tagalog and English are used as second languages. Kinabalian, a type of &quot;rare, unique language&quot;, is spoken alongside Cebuano in the towns of San Juan and Anahawan.

=== Religion ===
Limasawa, an island municipality to the south, is believed to be the site of the first Christian mass in Philippine soil and the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines, when Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator and explorer landed on March 28, 1521. The first Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was held on March 31, 1521, led by Friar Pedro de Valderrama, the chaplain of Ferdinand Magellan during the expedition. The mass marked the start of Christian propagation.

== Culture ==

=== Beliefs ===
Although most people are Christians, a very few who live in remote villages of the province hold on to pre-Hispanic influences and make offerings and sacrifices before planting their crops. Farmers ritually sacrifice chickens and pigs to ensure that the spirits or elementals which they believe to be the cause of good harvest will grant them one.

=== Religious events ===
&quot;Fiesta&quot;, a Spanish term meaning &quot;festivity&quot;, is celebrated in the province with prayer, food, drinking, dance and music. Every barangay of every town in the province has its own celebration date. For instance, Hinunangan celebrates a town fiesta on the June 29 with the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Fluvial boat parade the day before. The &quot;kuratsa&quot; – a courtship dance-drama – highlights every occasion.

The province also holds its own festivals. &quot;Sinulog sa malitbog&quot; is an annual religious street pageant in Malitbog to pay homage to the Holy Child Jesus (Santo Niño), the town&#x27;s patron saint. Similarly, the historic and religious coming of the Spaniards is commemorated every March 31 in Limasawa with a cultural presentation and anniversary program dubbed &quot;Sinugdan&quot;, meaning &quot;beginning.&quot; Other festivals held in the province to highlight events are the &quot;Pagkamugna Festival&quot; and &quot;Pabulhon Festival&quot; in Maasin, &quot;Karomata Festival&quot; in Beunavista, Pintuyan, &quot;Tangka-tangka Festival&quot; in Tangkaan, Padre Burgos and &quot;Manhaon Festival&quot; in Macrohon.

== Economy ==
=== Farming ===

==== Coconut ====
Most of the people in Southern Leyte go into coconut planting, a widely distributed industry, especially in mountainous and even plain regions. The GIZ of the German Development Cooperation has embarked on a value chain study on one of the most important products in Region 8 – the coconut, particularly in Leyte and Southern Leyte.

In the year 2004, a beetle pest threatened the Philippine coconut industry including Visayas. &quot;Brontispa longissima&quot; causes great damage to seedlings and mature coconut trees and ornamental palms, killing the young spears and eventually the entire trees.

==== Abaca ====
People in Southern Leyte also go into abaca planting. The province is one of the major producer of abaca fiber in the country along with Catanduanes, Leyte, Davao Oriental, Northern Samar, Sorsogon, Sulu, Davao del Sur, and Surigao del Sur. The fibers from Leyte and the province are recognized as having the best quality. On the year 1990 to 1999, Southern Leyte produced abaca with a rate of 17 percent.

In 2003, &quot;Abaca bunchy top virus&quot; threatened the abaca industry in the province. Almost all of the abaca-producing municipalities in the area namely Maasin, Padre Burgos, Malitbog, Tomas Oppus, Bontoc, Sogod, St. Bernard, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago were greatly affected by the deadly virus except from the municipalities at Panaon Island. Eighty percent of the province&#x27;s abaca, particularly in Sogod town, was greatly affected while Maasin was estimated to suffer about 30 percent in damages.

=== Tourism ===
Some 200,000 tourists visit Southern Leyte each year.

Domestic tourism is mostly those wishing to enjoy the sandy beaches, hotels and resorts along the coastline. Significant numbers also visit for religious festivals such as Sinulog and Limasawa.

Most international travelers visit Southern Leyte for reef diving and snorkeling, from just outside Maasin City, all the way around Sogod Bay via Padre Burgos. There are also an increasing number of non-divers who come to see the whale sharks between October and April.

In recent years there has been a drive to promote tourism in the region. There is a Zoo and Wildlife Park in Barangay Danao in Maasin. In Sogod, a zip line exists over the highest bridge in the Philippines.

With this increase in numbers, there is a selection of new hotels along the coast.

=== Industries ===
Abaca fiber helps livelihood in the province. Women in the selected areas go into abaca-based handicrafts, which is widely known in the area as &quot;tagak&quot; or spooled abaca fiber. Natives usually called it as &quot;tinagak&quot; or continuous spooled abaca fiber. The half-finished product is then made into &quot;sinamay&quot; or hand woven clothe out of &quot;tinagak&quot; ready to be made into other &quot;sinamay&quot;based products. Products are being exported by Leyte to Japan. Because of a wide distribution of an industry called &quot;tagak&quot;, provincial sectors taught farmers on how to cultivate a suitable variety locally called &quot;laylay&quot;.

In Bontoc, a project was successfully established with a mudcrab hatchery with eleven hatchery tanks at the RKKMAFTI Compound. Initially, 25 spawners are being worked-on by the project.

Aside from abaca-based products, ceramics and handicraft items made from coconut and bamboo are also the province&#x27;s industry. Among the province&#x27;s economic activities are fishing, livestock and poultry raising.

Generally, rice is the staple food of the province, and corn is also used. Mountainliving folks, however, prefer root crops, which are abundant. Native delicacies of the province include &quot;tres marias&quot;, &quot;bocarillo&quot;, &#x27;salvaro&quot;, &quot;bibingka&quot;, and &quot;starhoy&quot;. &quot;They also have their own &quot;kinilaw&quot;.

== Infrastructure ==

Maharlika road contributes to the development of the province.

There are six designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: Maasin, Liloan, Sogod, San Juan, Hinunangan and Silago. However, these terminals are open spaces used by buses as parking areas and are therefore not equipped with buildings and other facilities.

Southern Leyte has a total of eleven seaports, two of which are declared as national ports, the Maasin and Liloan ports, and the 10 are municipal ports.

<doc id="246350" wikidata="Q104157" url="?curid=246350" title="Cities of the Philippines">
<text>A city ( or ) is one of the units of local government in the Philippines. All Philippine cities are chartered cities (Filipino: ), whose existence as corporate and administrative entities is governed by their own specific municipal charters in addition to the Local Government Code of 1991, which specifies their administrative structure and powers. As of July 8, 2023, there are 149 cities.

A city is entitled to at least one representative in the House of Representatives if its population reaches 250,000. Cities are allowed to use a common seal. As corporate entities, cities have the power to take, purchase, receive, hold, lease, convey, and dispose of real and personal property for their general interests; condemn private property for public use (eminent domain); contract and be contracted with; sue; and exercise all powers conferred on them by Congress. Only an act of Congress can create or amend a city charter, and through this charter, Congress confers on a city certain powers that regular municipalities or even other cities may not have.

Despite differences in the powers accorded to each city, all cities, regardless of status, are given a larger share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) compared to regular municipalities, and are generally more autonomous than regular municipalities.

==Government==
A city&#x27;s local government is headed by a mayor elected by popular vote. The vice mayor serves as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (city council), which serves as the city&#x27;s legislative body. Upon receiving their charters, cities also receive a full complement of executive departments to better serve their constituents. Some departments are established on a case-by-case basis, depending on the needs of the city.

===Offices and officials common to all cities===

==Subdivisions==
Cities, like municipalities, are composed of barangays, which can range from urban neighborhoods (such as Barangay 9, Santa Angela in Laoag), to rural communities (such as Barangay Iwahig in Puerto Princesa). Barangays are sometimes grouped into officially defined administrative (geographical) districts. Examples of such are the cities of Manila (16 districts), Davao (11 districts), Iloilo (seven districts), and Samal (three districts: Babak, Kaputian and Peñaplata). Some cities such as Caloocan, Manila, and Pasay even have an intermediate level between the district and barangay levels, called a zone. However, geographic districts and zones are not political units; there are no elected city government officials in these city-specific administrative levels. Rather, they only serve to make city planning, statistics-gathering, and other administrative tasks easier and more convenient.

== Classification ==
=== Income classification ===
Republic Act No. 11964, or the Automatic Income Classification of Local Government Units Act, was signed by President Bongbong Marcos on October 26, 2023. The law classifies cities into five classes according to their income ranges, based on the average annual regular income for three fiscal years preceding a general income reclassification. The classification are as follows:

=== Legal classification ===
The Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) classifies all cities into one of three legal categories:

*Highly urbanized cities (HUC): Cities with a minimum population of two hundred thousand (200,000) inhabitants, as certified by the Philippine Statistics Authority, and with the latest annual income of at least fifty million pesos (50,000,000 or USD 1,000,000) based on 1991 constant prices, as certified by the city treasurer. However, San Juan City in Metro Manila became a highly-urbanized city in 2007 through Republic Act 9388 despite having a population of 126,347 people. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on July 21, 2007, approved the conversion.

:There are currently 33 highly urbanized cities in the Philippines, 16 of which are located in Metro Manila.

*Independent component cities (ICC): Cities of this type have charters that explicitly prohibit their residents from voting for provincial officials. All five of them are considered independent from the province in which they are geographically located: Cotabato, Dagupan, Naga (Camarines Sur), Ormoc, and Santiago.
*Component cities (CC): Cities which do not meet the preceding requirements are deemed part of the province in which they are geographically located. If a component city is located along the boundaries of two or more provinces, it is considered part of the province of which it used to be a municipality.

===Independent cities===

There are 38 independent cities in the Philippines, all of which are classified as either &quot;Highly urbanized&quot; or &quot;Independent component&quot; cities. A city classified as such:
* does not have its &quot;Sangguniang Panlungsod&quot; legislation subject to review by any province&#x27;s &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot;;
* does not share tax revenue with any province; and
* is directly supervised by the President of the Philippines through the city government (given that the provincial government no longer exercises supervision over city officials), as stated in Section 29 of the Local Government Code.

Currently, there are only four independent cities in two classes that can still participate in the election of provincial officials (governor, vice governor, and &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; members):
* Cities declared highly urbanized between 1987 and 1992, whose charters (as amended) explicitly permitted residents to both vote and run for elective positions in the provincial government, and therefore allowed by Section 452-c of the Local Government Code to maintain these rights: Lucena (Quezon), Mandaue (Cebu);
* Independent component cities whose charters (as amended) only explicitly allow residents to run for provincial offices: Dagupan (Pangasinan) and Naga (Camarines Sur)

Registered voters of the cities of Cotabato, Ormoc, Santiago, as well as all other highly urbanized cities, including those to be converted or created in the future, cannot participate in provincial elections.

In addition to the eligibility of some independent cities to vote in provincial elections, a few other situations become sources of confusion regarding the complete autonomy of independent cities from provinces:
* Some independent cities still serve as the seat of government for the province in which they are geographically located: Bacolod (Negros Occidental), Cagayan de Oro (Misamis Oriental), Cebu City (Cebu), Iloilo City (Iloilo), Lucena (Quezon), Puerto Princesa (Palawan) and Tacloban (Leyte). In such cases, the provincial government, apart from already financing the maintenance of its properties such as provincial government buildings and offices, may also provide the government of the independent city with an annual budget (determined by the province at its discretion) to aid in relieving incidental costs incurred by the city such as road maintenance due to increased vehicular traffic in the vicinity of the provincial government complex. The independent city of Butuan was the capital and seat of government in the province of Agusan del Norte until Cabadbaran became the province&#x27;s capital since 2000.
* Some independent cities are still grouped with their former provinces for the purposes of representation in Congress. While 24 independent cities have their own representative(s) in Congress, some remain part of the congressional representation of the province to which they formerly belonged: Butuan, for example, is still part of the 1st congressional district of Agusan del Norte. In cases like this, independent cities that do not vote for provincial officials are excluded from Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial council) districts, and the allotment of SP members is adjusted accordingly by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) with proper consideration of population. For example, Agusan del Norte (being a third income-class province) is entitled to elect eight members to its Sangguniang Panlalawigan, and belongs to two congressional districts. The seats of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan are not evenly distributed (4–4) between the province&#x27;s first and second congressional districts because its 1st district contains Butuan, an independent city which does not vote for provincial officials. Rather, the seats are distributed 1–7 to account for the small population of the province&#x27;s 1st &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; district (consisting only of Las Nieves) and the bulk of the province&#x27;s population being in the second district. On the other hand, the city of Lucena, which is eligible to vote for provincial officials, still forms part of the province of Quezon&#x27;s 2nd &quot;Sangguniang Panlalawigan&quot; district, which is coterminous with the 2nd congressional district of Quezon.
* General lack of distinction for independent cities, for practical purposes: Many government agencies, as well as Philippine society in general, still continue to classify many independent cities outside Metro Manila as part of provinces due to historical and cultural ties, especially if these cities were once or currently socio-economic and cultural capitals of the provinces to which they once belonged. Furthermore, most maps of the Philippines showing provincial boundaries almost never separate independent cities from the provinces in which they are geographically located, for cartographic convenience. Despite being first-level administrative divisions (i.e., on the same level as provinces, as stated in Section 25 of the LGC), independent cities are still treated by many to be on the same level as municipalities and component cities (second-level administrative divisions) for educational convenience and simplicity.

A component city, while enjoying relative autonomy on some matters compared to a regular municipality, is still considered part of a province. However, there are several sources of confusion:
* Some component cities form their own congressional representation, separate from their province. The representation of a city in the House of Representatives (or lack thereof) is not a criterion for independence from a province, as Congress is the national legislative body and is part of the national (central) government. Despite Antipolo, Biñan and San Jose del Monte having their own representatives in Congress, they are still component cities of Rizal, Laguna, and Bulacan, respectively, as their respective charters specifically converted them into component cities and have no provision stating a severance in relations with their respective provincial governments.
* Being part of an administrative region different from the province: Isabela City functions as a component city of Basilan: its tax revenues are shared with the provincial government, its residents are eligible to both vote and run for provincial offices, and it is served by the provincial government and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Basilan with regard to provincially devolved services. However, by opting out of joining the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), Isabela City&#x27;s residents are ineligible to vote and run for &quot;regional&quot; offices of the Bangsamoro Parliament, unlike the rest of Basilan. Regional services provided to Isabela City come from offices in Region IX based in Pagadian; the rest of Basilan is serviced by the BARMM based in Cotabato City. Isabela City, while not independent from its province, is this outside the jurisdiction of the BARMM, the region to which the rest of Basilan belongs. Regions are not the primary subnational administrative divisions of the Philippines, but rather the provinces.

==Creation of cities==
Congress is the lone legislative entity that can incorporate cities. Provincial and municipal councils can pass resolutions indicating a desire to have a certain area (usually an already-existing municipality or a cluster of barangays) declared a city after the requirements for becoming a city are met. As per Republic Act No. 9009, these requirements include:
* locally generated income of at least 100 million (based on constant prices in the year 2000) for the last two consecutive years, as certified by the Department of Finance, and
* a population of at least 150,000, as certified by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), or a contiguous territory of 100 square kilometers, as certified by the Land Management Bureau, with contiguity not being a requisite for areas that are on two or more islands.
Republic Act No. 11683 further amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code in 2022, exempting a municipality qualified for cityhood from the land or population threshold if the municipality has a locally generated average annual income of 400 million pesos for the previous 2 years according to 2012 constant prices, though this amount &quot;shall be increased by five percent&quot; for every three years after the law&#x27;s effectivity.

Members of Congress (usually the involving representative of the congressional district to which the proposed city belongs) then draft the legislation that will convert or create the city. After the bill passes through both the House of Representatives and the Senate and becomes an Act of Congress, the President signs the Act into law. If the Act goes unsigned after 30 days it still becomes law despite the absence of the President&#x27;s signature.

The creation of cities before 1983 was solely at the discretion of the national legislature; there were no requirements for achieving &#x27;city&#x27; status other than an approved city charter. No income, population or land area requirements had to be met to incorporate cities before &quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 337&quot; (Local Government Code of 1983) became law. This is what made it possible for several current cities such as Tangub or Canlaon to be conferred such a status despite their small population and locally generated income, which do not meet current standards. The relatively low income standard between 1992 and 2001 (which was 20 million) also allowed several municipalities, such as Sipalay and Muñoz, to become cities despite not being able to meet the current 100 million local income standard.

Before 1987, many cities were created without any plebiscites conducted for the residents to ratify the city charter, most notable of which were cities that were incorporated during the early American colonial period (Manila and Baguio), and during the Commonwealth Era (1935–1946) such as Cavite City, Dansalan (now Marawi), Iloilo City, Bacolod, San Pablo and Zamboanga City. Only since 1987 has it been mandated under the Constitution that any change to the legal status of any local government unit requires the ratification by the residents that would be affected by such changes. Therefore, all cities created after 1987 – after meeting the requirements for cityhood as laid out in the Local Government Code of 1991 and Republic Act No. 9009 of 2001 – only acquired their corporate status after the majority of their voting residents approved their respective charters.

===Motivations for cityhood===
Although some early cities were given charters because of their advantageous (Baguio, Tagaytay) or strategic (Angeles City and Olongapo, Cotabato, Zamboanga) locations or to especially establish new government centers in otherwise sparsely populated areas (Palayan, Trece Martires, Quezon City), most Philippine cities were originally incorporated to provide a form of localized civil government to an area that is primarily urban, which, due to its compact nature and different demography and local economy, cannot be necessarily handled more efficiently by more rural-oriented provincial and municipal governments. However, not all cities are purely areas of dense urban settlement. To date there are still cities with huge expanses of rural or wilderness areas and considerable non-urban populations, such as Calbayog, Davao, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga as they were deliberately incorporated with increased future resource needs and urban expansion, as well as strategic considerations, in mind.

With the enactment of the 1991 Local Government Code, municipalities and cities have both become more empowered to deal with local issues. Regular municipalities now share many of the same powers and responsibilities as chartered cities, but its citizens and/or leaders may feel that it might be to their best interest to get a larger share of internal revenue allotment (IRA) and acquire additional powers by becoming a city, especially if the population has greatly increased and local economy has become more robust. On the other hand, due to the higher property taxes that would be imposed after cityhood, many citizens have become wary of their town&#x27;s conversion into a city, even if the municipality had already achieved a high degree of urbanization and has an annual income that already exceeds that of many existing lower-income cities. This has been among the cases made against the cityhood bids of many high-income and populous municipalities surrounding Metro Manila, most notably Bacoor and Dasmariñas (which finally became cities in June 2012 and November 2009 respectively), which for many years have been more qualified to become cities than others.

In response to the rapid increase in the number of municipalities being converted into cities since the enactment of the Local Government Code in 1991, Senator Aquilino Pimentel authored what became Republic Act No. 9009 in June 2001 which sought to establish a more appropriate benchmark by which municipalities that wished to become cities were to be measured. The income requirement was increased sharply from 20 million to 100 million in a bid to curb the spate of conversions into cities of municipalities that were perceived to have not become urbanized or economically developed enough to be able to properly function as a city.

Despite the passage of RA 9009, 16 municipalities not meeting the required locally generated income were converted into cities in 2007 by seeking exemption from the income requirement. This led to vocal opposition from the League of Cities of the Philippines against the cityhood of these municipalities, with the League arguing that by letting these municipalities become cities, Congress will set &quot;a dangerous precedent&quot; that would not prevent others from seeking the same &quot;special treatment&quot;. More importantly, the LCP argued that with the recent surge in the conversion of towns that did not meet the requirements set by RA 9009 for becoming cities, the allocation received by existing cities would only drastically decrease because more cities will have to share the amount allotted by the national government, which is equal to 23% of the IRA, which in turn is 40% of all the revenues collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The resulting legal battles resulted in the nullification of the city charters of the 16 municipalities by the Supreme Court in August 2010. (&quot;See #&quot;League of 16&quot; and legal battles)&quot;

==Changing city status==
Throughout the years there have been instances of changes to the city&#x27;s status with regard to eligibility for provincial elections, as a result of the passage of laws, both of general effectivity and specific to a city.

=== Before 1979 ===
Prior to 1979, all cities were just considered chartered cities, without any official category differentiating them aside from income levels. Though chartered cities were considered autonomous from the provinces from which they were created, the eligibility of their residents to vote for provincial officials was determined by their respective charters.

Regarding participation in provincial affairs, there were three types of city charters:
# those which explicitly allowed their respective residents to elect provincial officials,
# those which explicitly prohibited participation in provincial elections,
# and those which are silent regarding voter participation in provincial elections.
The 1951 Supreme Court decision on &quot;Teves, et al. v. Commission on Elections&quot; finally resolved the ambiguity surrounding the third category of cities, by confirming that the residents of cities with such charters (such as Dumaguete and Davao City) are ineligible to participate in provincial elections.

Altering the right of city residents to participate in provincial elections was a power solely determined by the national legislature. Before 1979, this power was exercised in seven cases, affecting a total of six cities:
* Five Acts of the National Assembly or Congress in which the residents of an existing city were restored the right to vote for officials of the mother province:
** August 22, 1940: Section 7 of the revised charter of the city of Iloilo (&quot;Commonwealth Act No. 158&quot;) was amended in 1940 by Commonwealth Act No. 604 to explicitly state: &quot;The voters of said City of Iloilo shall take part in the election of the provincial officers of Iloilo, but the latter shall have no jurisdiction over the City of Iloilo and the officers thereof.&quot;
** June 10, 1950: The original city charter of Dagupan (Republic Act No. 170) was originally silent on the matter of the eligibility of city residents to participate in provincial election, therefore implying that residents were ineligible to participate in provincial elections. Three years later Republic Act No. 448 amended the charter to explicitly empower the city&#x27;s voters to participate in the election of the governor and provincial board members of Pangasinan.
** June 14, 1956: The city of Cabanatuan was originally explicitly excluded from electing and being elected into positions in the provincial government of Nueva Ecija until its original city charter (Republic Act No. 526) was amended by Republic Act No. 1445 in 1956, which enabled the city&#x27;s residents to once more vote for provincial officials.
** June 16, 1956: The original city charter of Dansalan (&quot;Commonwealth Act No. 592&quot;) was originally silent on the matter of the eligibility of city residents to participate in provincial election, therefore implying that residents were ineligible to participate in provincial elections. Sixteen years later Republic Act No. 1552, in addition to renaming the city to Marawi, also amended the city charter to explicitly empower the city&#x27;s voters to participate in the election of Lanao Province officials.
** June 10, 1964: Cebu City&#x27;s old charter (&quot;Commonwealth Act No. 58&quot;) was repealed, and replaced with Republic Act No. 3857 in 1964. The law allowed the city&#x27;s residents to once more become eligible to vote for officials in the provincial government of Cebu.
** June 21, 1969: Following the Supreme Court decision on &quot;Teves, et al. v. Commission on Elections&quot; which upheld Dumaguete&#x27;s independence from Negros Oriental, Republic Act No. 5797 was enacted on June 21, 1969, by Congress to revise the city&#x27;s original charter (Republic Act No. 327) to explicitly allow the city&#x27;s residents to once again vote for provincial officials.
* One Act of Congress in which the residents of existing cities whose residents were previously explicitly granted the right to participate in provincial elections were deprived such a right:
** June 19, 1959: By virtue of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 2259, the voters of the cities of Dagupan and Iloilo were deprived of the right to participate in provincial elections.

===1979–1983===
&quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 51&quot;, approved on December 22, 1979, introduced two legal categories of cities: highly urbanized cities (HUCs) and component cities. COMELEC Resolution No. 1421, which was issued to implement the provisions of &quot;BP 51&quot; prior to the January 30, 1980, local elections, stated that a total of 20 cities were not allowed to participate in the election of provincial officials: seven of these were &quot;highly urbanized&quot;, while the remaining 13 were &quot;component&quot; cities.
* When &quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 51&quot; came into effect for the January 30, 1980, elections, all cities whose incomes at the time were 40 million or higher were considered highly urbanized cities. Cities that met this income requirement at the time were: Caloocan, Cebu, Davao, Manila, Pasay and Quezon City. Regardless of whether their respective charters allowed them to vote for provincial officials or not, highly urbanized cities were no longer allowed to vote for provincial officials. Among the aforementioned, only the voters of Cebu City lost the right to participate in provincial elections in this manner; the voters of the other five cities have not participated in any provincial election since their respective incorporation as cities. In addition, Section 3 of &quot;BP 51&quot; also made Baguio a highly urbanized city irrespective of its income, due to its importance as the host to the official summer residences of the President and the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court case decided two days before election day upheld the legality of &quot;BP 51&quot; in depriving the voters of Cebu City the power to elect officials for the province of Cebu.
* Per Section 3 of &quot;BP 51&quot;, all other cities were considered &quot;component cities&quot; of the provinces in which they are geographically located, or the provinces of which they were originally a part. Despite considering all other cities as part of their respective provinces, under &quot;BP 51&quot; the eligibility of voters to participate in provincial elections were still determined by their cities&#x27; respective charters (as amended). The voters of a total of thirteen &quot;component cities&quot; continued to be ineligible to vote for provincial officials for the local elections of 1980. Nine of these were cities with charters (as amended) that expressly prohibited participation in provincial elections: Dagupan, General Santos, Iloilo, Mandaue, Naga, Ormoc, Oroquieta, San Carlos (Pangasinan) and Zamboanga. The remaining four — Bais, Canlaon, Cotabato and Ozamiz — were cities whose charters were silent on participation in provincial elections; &quot;BP 51&quot; upheld the 1951 Supreme Court decision on &quot;Teves, et al. v. Commission on Elections&quot; by barring their residents from participating in the election of provincial officials.

=== 1983–1987 ===
&quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 337&quot; (Local Government Code of 1983), approved on February 10, 1983, further refined the criteria by which cities can be classified as highly urbanized cities. Under &quot;BP 337&quot; a city that had at least 150,000 inhabitants and an income of at least 30 million was to be declared highly urbanized by the Minister of Local Government within thirty days of the city having met the requirement. The cities of Angeles (October 13, 1986), Bacolod (September 27, 1984), Butuan (February 7, 1985), Cagayan de Oro, Iligan (both November 22, 1983), Olongapo (December 7, 1983), and Zamboanga (November 22, 1983) became HUCs in this manner. The residents in most of these cities lost their right to participate in provincial elections for the first time. The two exceptions are: Iloilo City, which had already been deprived of the right to vote for provincial officials in 1959 by virtue of Section 2 of RA 2259, and Zamboanga City, which had been autonomously governed since its creation by virtue of Section 47 of its city charter (&quot;Commonwealth Act No. 39&quot;).

By virtue of Section 30 of &quot;Batas Pambansa Bilang 881&quot; (&quot;Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines&quot;), approved on December 3, 1985, provided that: &quot;unless their respective charters provide otherwise, the electorate of component cities shall be entitled to vote in the election for provincial officials of the province of which it is a part.&quot; This provision therefore overrides the 1951 Supreme Court decision on &quot;Teves, et al. v. Commission on Elections&quot; by providing voters in component cities whose charters are silent on the matter of electing provincial officials the right to again participate in provincial elections. &quot;BP 881&quot; therefore again enfranchised voters in the cities of Bais and Canlaon (Negros Oriental), and Ozamiz (Misamis Occidental). Despite the charter of the city of Cotabato being silent on the matter of electing provincial officials, the city was not legislated to be part of any of the successor provinces of the old undivided Cotabato province. Voters of the city therefore were still not eligible to vote in the provincial elections of either Maguindanao or North Cotabato and therefore remained independent from any province.

===1987–1991===
The period between ratification of the new Constitution (February 1987) and the effectivity of the Local Government Code of 1991 (January 1992) was one of transition. During this time, &quot;BP 51&quot;, &quot;BP 337&quot; and &quot;BP 881&quot; were still in force: the only legal classes of cities during this period were still &quot;highly urbanized&quot; and &quot;component&quot; cities.

Altering the right of city residents to participate in provincial elections was once again exercised by the newly restored Congress in this period. A total of three cities were affected: Republic Acts Nos. 6641 (in 1987), 6726 (in 1989) and 6843 (in 1990), once again allowed the residents of Mandaue, Oroquieta and San Carlos to vote for provincial officials of Cebu, Misamis Occidental and Pangasinan respectively. Since &quot;BP 51&quot;—which only considered cities as being either &quot;highly urbanized&quot; or &quot;component&quot;—was still in force at the time, the changes were not considered as switching between legal categories, but rather a simple change within the &quot;component city&quot; classification that did not require a plebiscite. The &quot;independent component city&quot; legal classification was only introduced through the Local Government Code in 1992.

Under the same criteria set in &quot;BP 337&quot; (Local Government Code of 1983), a total of three cities became highly urbanized: General Santos (September 5, 1988), Lucena (July 1, 1991) and Mandaue (February 15, 1991). Lucena and Mandaue were special cases, in that because their re-classification into HUC status took place after the ratification of the Constitution (February 11, 1987) but before the effectivity of the Local Government Code of 1991 (January 1, 1992), their residents were allowed to continue to participate in the election of provincial officials as per their respective charters (as amended), by virtue of Section 452-c of the LGC. Residents of General Santos were already excluded from voting for provincial officials of South Cotabato since achieving cityhood in 1968; they were therefore unaffected by this exemption.

===1992–present===
The Local Government Code of 1991 came into effect on January 1, 1992, and has remained in force ever since, though some amendments have been made. New requirements for creating cities, and upgrading cities to highly urbanized status, were instituted under this Act. The &quot;LGC of 1991&quot; was also the first time the independent component city (ICC) category was introduced. These cities are those non-highly urbanized cities whose charters explicitly prohibited city residents to vote in provincial elections. They were finally made completely independent of the province from fiscal, administrative and legal standpoints.

====Upgrading====
*&quot;Independent municipality to highly urbanized city&quot;
The municipalities of Metro Manila, having been severed from the provinces of Bulacan and Rizal and made independent units in 1975, were converted to highly urbanized cities, beginning in 1994 with Mandaluyong. The most recent, Navotas, became an HUC in 2007. Only Pateros, which does not currently meet the population requirement of 200,000 inhabitants, remains the only independent municipality in Metro Manila.

*&quot;Component city to independent component city (CC–ICC)&quot;
All that is needed is a congressional amendment to a component city&#x27;s charter, prohibiting city residents to vote for provincial officials.
In the last quarter of 2021, Samar 1st district congressman Edgar Mary Sarmiento proposed to convert the city of Calbayog from being a component city into an independent component city through the virtue of House Bill No. 10483.

*&quot;Component/independent component city to highly urbanized city (CC/ICC–HUC)&quot;
Since 1992, once a city reaches a population of 200,000 persons as certified by the Philippine Statistics Authority and an income of 50 million (based on 1991 constant prices) as certified by the city treasurer, the city government can submit a request to the President to have their city declared as highly urbanized within 30 days. Upon the President&#x27;s declaration, a plebiscite will be held within a specific timeframe to ratify this conversion. There are no limits as to the number of times a component city can attempt to become a highly urbanized city, should previous tries be unsuccessful.
* Since 1992 three component cities have been successfully converted into HUCs:
** Puerto Princesa (2007): Proclamation No. 1264 signed on March 26, 2007, declared the capital city of Palawan an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on July 21, 2007, approved the conversion.
** Lapu-Lapu (2007): Proclamation No. 1222 signed on January 23, 2007, declared the component city of Lapu-Lapu an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on July 21, 2007, approved the conversion.
** Tacloban (2008): Proclamation No. 1637 signed on October 4, 2008, declared the capital city of Leyte an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on December 18, 2008, approved the conversion.
* The following component cities failed to become HUCs, for various reasons:
** Cabanatuan (1997): Proclamation No. 969 signed on February 13, 1997, declared the former capital of the province of Nueva Ecija an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held simultaneously with the barangay elections on May 12, 1997 did not approve the conversion.
** Tarlac City (2005): Proclamation No. 940 signed on October 27, 2005, declared the capital city of the province of Tarlac an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on February 11, 2006, did not approve the conversion.
** Antipolo (2011): Proclamation No. 124 signed on March 14, 2011, declared the capital city of the province of Rizal an HUC. On April 4, 2011, Antipolo&#x27;s city mayor announced that the planned June 18, 2011, plebiscite is indefinitely postponed, effectively suspending the bid to convert the city into an HUC.
** Cabanatuan (2012): Proclamation No. 418 signed on July 4, 2012, once again declared the former capital of the province of Nueva Ecija an HUC. The plebiscite was originally set for December 1, 2012, but, due to preparations for the upcoming 2013 national, ARMM and local elections, was rescheduled by the COMELEC for January 25, 2014. A week before the rescheduled plebiscite, the Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order, which postponed the vote until the case brought by Nueva Ecija governor Aurelio Umali was decided. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court ordered the Commission to include the rest of Nueva Ecija in the plebiscite, given that the province&#x27;s income will be significantly affected once Cabanatuan attains autonomy as an HUC. The Commission subsequently rescheduled the expanded plebiscite for November 8, 2014. However, on October 21 it issued Minute Resolution No. 14-0732, which suspended the voting until the city government of Cabanatuan provides the 101 million needed to administer the expanded plebiscite.
** San Jose del Monte (2020): Proclamation No. 1057 signed on December 4, 2020, declared the component city of the province of Bulacan an HUC. Majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on October 30, 2023, did not approve the conversion.

====Downgrading====
=====&quot;Highly urbanized city to component city&quot;=====
Reclassifying an HUC as a component city likely involves not only amending the concerned city&#x27;s charter, but also the Local Government Code, as currently there is no provision in the &quot;LGC&quot; that allows this, nor are there any precedents. Some Cebu City politicians have previously indicated that they wish to bring back the city under the province&#x27;s control, to bring in more votes against the &quot;Sugbuak&quot;, the proposed partition of Cebu Province.

=====&quot;Independent component city to component city&quot;=====
A congressional amendment to the city charter enabling city residents to vote for provincial officials is required, followed by a plebiscite. Santiago&#x27;s status as an independent component city was briefly in question after the enactment of Republic Act No. 8528 on February 14, 1998, which sought to make it a regular component city. The Supreme Court on September 16, 1999, however ruled in favor of the city&#x27;s mayor who contended that such a change in the status of the city required a plebiscite just like any other merger, division, abolition or alteration in boundaries of any political unit. And due to the lack of a plebiscite to affirm such a change, RA 8528 was therefore unconstitutional.

====Amendments====
On April 11, 2022, a day after it lapsed into law without the signature of the president, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11683, which amended Section 450 of the Local Government Code, making the conversion of municipalities into cities easier. The amendments state that if a municipality generates at least ₱400 million for two consecutive years, it will be exempt from the land and population requirements.

==League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP)==

The League is a non-profit organization and is not a government agency and was founded in 1988. As of July 8, 2023, the league has a membership of 149 cities. The organization was formed to help coordinate efforts to improve governance and local autonomy and to tackle issues such as preserving the environment and improving public works.

==List of cities==
, there are 149 cities in the Philippines. Carmona in Cavite is the newest city, after the plebiscite held resulted in approval of ratification on July 8, 2023.

Comprising the present-day territories of Legazpi City and Daraga, the city was dissolved on June 8, 1954 when Legazpi and Daraga were made into separate municipalities. Legazpi eventually became a city on its own on June 12, 1959.
* Basilan City (1948–1973): Formerly part of the city of Zamboanga until it was made a city on its own in 1948 through Republic Act No. 288. Delimited to only the downtown area of what is now Isabela City upon the creation of the province of Basilan in 1973 through &quot;Presidential Decree No. 356&quot; by President Ferdinand Marcos. Finally abolished and its territory annexed to the municipality of Isabela on November 7, 1975, through &quot;Presidential Decree No. 840&quot;.
* Rajah Buayan City (1966): Under Republic Act No. 4413, the then-municipality of General Santos in what was then the unified province of Cotabato was to be formally converted into a city named after a historical ruler in Mindanao on January 1, 1966, provided that majority of qualified voters in the municipality vote in favor of cityhood in a plebiscite. In December 1965 the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) proclaimed the cityhood of Rajah Buayan, with 4,422 people voting for and 3,066 voting against. However, two residents of the new city challenged this by arguing in the courts that the number of people who voted in favor of cityhood did not form a majority in light of the fact that there were 15,727 voters in the city. The court issued an injunction on January 4, 1966, restraining city officers from performing any acts authorized by or pursuant to provisions in RA 4413. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld this decision on October 29, 1966, and declared that the city charter was not accepted by majority of voters, thus rendering RA 4413 null and void. The municipality of General Santos would later be converted into a city under the same name in 1968.

====&quot;League of 16&quot; and legal battles====
The Supreme Court of the Philippines, by a highly divided vote of 6–5, on November 18, 2008, subsequently upheld with finality on May 6, 2009, declared unconstitutional cityhood laws converting 16 municipalities into cities. The 24-page judgment of Justice Antonio T. Carpio, adjudged that the following cityhood laws violate secs. 6 and 10, Article X of the Constitution of the Philippines:
*RA No. 9389 (Baybay, Leyte)
*RA No. 9390 (Bogo, Cebu)
*RA No. 9391 (Catbalogan, Samar)
*RA No. 9392 (Tandag, Surigao del Sur)
*RA No. 9393 (Lamitan, Basilan)
*RA No. 9394 (Borongan, Eastern Samar)
*RA No. 9398 (Tayabas, Quezon)
*RA No. 9404 (Tabuk, Kalinga)
*RA No. 9405 (Bayugan, Agusan del Sur)
*RA No. 9407 (Batac,Ilocos Norte)
*RA No. 9408 (Mati, Davao Oriental)
*RA No. 9409 (Guihulngan, Negros Oriental)
*RA No. 9434 (Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte)
*RA No. 9435 (El Salvador, Misamis Oriental)
*RA No. 9436 (Carcar, Cebu)
*RA No. 9491 (Naga, Cebu)
:The Court held that the foregoing cityhood laws, all enacted after RA 9009&#x27;s effectivity, &quot;explicitly exempt respondent municipalities from the increased income requirement from 20 million to 100 million in Section 450 of the Local Government Code (LGC), as amended by RA 9009. Such exemption clearly violates Section 10, Article X of the Constitution and is thus patently unconstitutional. To be valid, such exemption must be written in the Local Government Code and not in any other law, including the Cityhood Laws.&quot;

However, more than a year later, on December 22, 2009, acting on the appeal of the so-called League of 16 Cities (an informal group consisting of the sixteen local government units whose cityhood status had been reversed), the Supreme Court reversed its earlier ruling as it ruled that &quot;at the end of the day, the passage of the amendatory law (regarding the criteria for cityhood as set by Congress) is no different from the enactment of a law, i.e., the cityhood laws specifically exempting a particular political subdivision from the criteria earlier mentioned. Congress, in enacting the exempting law/s, effectively decreased the already codified indicators.&quot; As such, the cityhood status of the said 16 LGUs was effectively restored.

On August 24, 2010, in a 16-page resolution, the Supreme Court reinstated its November 18, 2008, decision striking down the cityhood laws, reducing once more the sixteen LGUs to the status of regular municipalities.

The most recent development in the legal battles surrounding the League of 16 came on February 15, 2011. Voting 7–6, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that 16 towns that became cities in 2007 can stay as cities. This was the fourth time the SC has ruled on the case, and the third reversal. It said the conversion of the 16 towns into cities met all legal requirements.

In March 2011, the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP), while challenging a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the cityhood conversion of 16 municipalities, has expressed support for the cityhood bids of 21 towns that have fulfilled the requirements outlined in the Local Government Code. These towns have demonstrated their compliance with the eligibility criteria required for cityhood were endorsed by the LCP for cityhood conversion:
* Laguna: Cabuyao, San Pedro
* Rizal: Cainta, Taytay, Binangonan
* Cavite: Bacoor, General Trias, Imus, Carmona, Silang 
* Nueva Ecija: Pantabangan
* Batangas: Calaca, Santo Tomas, Bauan, Nasugbu
* Quezon: Mauban
* Bulacan: Marilao, Santa Maria, Norzagaray
* Bataan: Limay

===Rejected cityhood===

* Batangas (1965): A majority of the votes cast in the then-municipality of Batangas rejected cityhood in a plebiscite conducted on the same day as the 1965 Philippine general elections, as mandated by Republic Act No. 4586. The city would have been named &quot;Laurel City&quot; in honor of Jose P. Laurel, the president of the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. The municipality of Batangas would later be converted into a city under the same name in 1969.
* Tarlac (1969): The city charter of Tarlac (Republic Act No. 5907) was approved on June 21, 1969. Cityhood was rejected in a plebiscite held on November 11, 1969, by a majority of the ballots cast. Tarlac became a city 29 years after, in 1998.
* Taguig (1998): Republic Act No. 8487, Taguig was supposed to be converted into a highly urbanized city but it was rejected due to lower income. More than six years later, the cityhood of Taguig was ratified with majority of the ballots cast votes in a plebiscite held on December 8, 2004.
* Ilagan (1999): Republic Act No. 8474, which converted Ilagan to a component city of Isabela, was approved on February 2, 1998. However, majority of votes cast in the plebiscite held on March 14, 1999, rejected cityhood. Ilagan finally became a city after majority of votes cast in the August 11, 2012, plebiscite approved the Republic Act No. 10169.
* Novaliches (1999): On February 23, 1998, the controversial City Charter of Novaliches (Republic Act No. 8535) was approved, which sought to create a new city out of the 15 northern barangays of Quezon City. Historically a separate town, Novaliches was distributed between Quezon City and northern Caloocan in 1948. In a plebiscite held on October 23, 1999, the majority of ballots cast (which included all voters of Quezon City and not just the 15 barangays) rejected the cityhood of Novaliches.
* Meycauayan (2001): Cityhood was rejected by majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite held on March 30, 2001, to ratify Republic Act No. 9021. Meycauayan became a city five years later with the enactment of Republic Act No. 9356 and its ratification through a plebiscite on December 10, 2006.

===Former names===
* Cagayan de Oro: The municipality of &quot;Cagayan&quot; was converted to the city of &quot;Cagayan de Oro&quot; in June 15, 1950, through Republic Act No. 521. An earlier bill was filed by Misamis Oriental Congressman Pedro S. Baculio for the creation of the City of Cagayan, however the 1st Congress was adjourned before any readings for the bill had done. The final, and enacted, cityhood bill authored by Congressman (and later Vice President) Emmanuel Pelaez gave the city its present name.
* Lapu-Lapu: The municipality of &quot;Opon&quot; was converted to a city named after &quot;Lapulapu&quot;, hero of the Battle of Mactan in 1961 through Republic Act No. 3134.
* Marawi: Inaugurated as the City of &quot;Dansalan&quot; in 1950, renamed to &quot;Marawi&quot; on June 16, 1956, through Republic Act No. 1552.
* Ozamiz: The municipality of &quot;Misamis&quot; was converted to a city named after José &quot;Ozámiz&quot;, the first governor of Misamis Occidental, in 1948 through Republic Act No. 321.
*Pasay: Inaugurated as &quot;Rizal City&quot; in 1947, reverted to &quot;Pasay&quot; on June 7, 1950, through Republic Act No. 437.
* Roxas: In 1951, the municipality of &quot;Capiz&quot; was converted to a city named after Manuel &quot;Roxas&quot;, the first president of the Third Philippine Republic and town native through Republic Act No. 603.

==Coaching career==
===OHL===
====Peterborough Petes (1983–1985)====
Martin served as an assistant coach with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in 1983–84, working under head coach Dick Todd. In his first season with the Petes, the team finished with a 43–23–4 record, finishing in third place in the Leyden Division. In the playoffs, the Petes swept the Cornwall Royals in the first round, before losing to the Toronto Marlboros in the second round.

After the season, Martin left Peterborough and became the head coach of the Guelph Platers.

====Guelph Platers (1985–1986)====
Martin became the head coach of the Guelph Platers of the OHL in 1985–86, as he took over the rebuilding club, which missed the playoffs the previous season. Under Martin, the Platers finished second in the Emms Division with a 41–23–2 record, earning 84 points, which was a 37-point improvement for the team. In the playoffs, the Platers would win the J. Ross Robertson Cup, defeating the Belleville Bulls in the final round, to advance to the 1986 Memorial Cup, held in Portland, Oregon. In the Memorial Cup, the Platers earned a 2–1 record in the round-robin and advanced straight to the finals. In the final game of the tournament, Guelph defeated the Hull Olympiques by a score of 6–2 to capture the Memorial Cup. Martin won the Matt Leyden Trophy awarded to the best coach in the OHL.

Following the season, Martin left the Platers and became the head coach of the St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League (NHL).

====Kingston Frontenacs (2022–2023)====
On September 16, 2022, the Kingston Frontenacs of the OHL named Martin to assume the role of Senior Advisor, marking Martin&#x27;s first OHL role since 1986.

===NHL===
====St. Louis Blues (1986–1988)====
Martin took over as the head coach of the St. Louis Blues in 1986–87. On October 9, 1986, Martin coached and won his first career NHL game, defeating the Los Angeles Kings 4–3. Despite the team finishing the season with an under .500 record of 32–33–15, the Blues had the best record in the Norris Division. In the first round of the playoffs, the Blues were upset by the Toronto Maple Leafs, losing in six games.

The Blues had another mediocre regular season in 1987–88, as the club finished with a 34–38–8 record, finishing in second place in the Norris Division. In the postseason, the Blues defeated the Chicago Blackhawks in five games in the Norris Division semifinals, however, St. Louis lost to the Detroit Red Wings in five games in the division final. After the season, the Blues fired Martin.

====Chicago Blackhawks (1988–1990)====
Martin became an assistant coach under newly hired Chicago Blackhawks head coach Mike Keenan in 1988–89. In his first season with the Hawks, the club finished in the fourth and final playoff position in the Norris Division with a 27–41–12 record. In the postseason, the Blackhawks upset the division-winning Detroit Red Wings in the first round, defeating them in six games. In the Norris Division finals against Martin&#x27;s former club, the St. Louis Blues, the Blackhawks continued their Cinderella run, defeating the favoured Blues in five games, advancing to the Campbell Conference final, against the Calgary Flames. The Blackhawks would lose to the Flames in five games, who went on to win the Stanley Cup.

The Blackhawks improved in the regular season in 1989–90, having the best record in the Norris Division with a 41–33–6, 88-point season. In the postseason, the Blackhawks defeated the Minnesota North Stars and St. Louis Blues to advance to the Campbell Conference finals for the second straight season. The Blackhawks&#x27; run would end, as the Edmonton Oilers defeated Chicago in six games.

After the season, Martin left the Blackhawks and joined the Quebec Nordiques as an assistant coach.

====Quebec Nordiques/Colorado Avalanche (1990–1996)====
Martin joined the Quebec Nordiques as an associate coach, working under newly hired head coach Dave Chambers, in 1990–91. The rebuilding Nordiques had a tough season, going 16–50–14, and missing the postseason.

Quebec saw some improvement in the 1991–92 season, as the club had a 20–48–12 record, however, the team once again finished in last place in the Adams Division, missing the playoffs. Head coach Dave Chambers was fired early in the season and was replaced with Pierre Pagé, as Martin was retained as the associate coach.

The Nordiques saw great improvement in 1992–93, as the club finished with a 47–27–10 record, earning 104 points, and second place in the Adams Division, qualifying for the postseason. In the first round, Quebec lost a thrilling series to the Montreal Canadiens in six games.

Martin was assigned to the Nordiques American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Cornwall Aces, as head coach for the 1993–94 season. The Aces finished the year with a 33–36–11 record, third in the Southern Division, and a berth into the postseason. In the playoffs, the Aces defeated the Hamilton Canucks in the first round, followed by defeating the favoured Hershey Bears in seven games in the second round. The Aces then lost to the Moncton Hawks in the third round.

Martin returned to the Nordiques as an assistant coach under Marc Crawford in 1994–95. Quebec finished the season with the best record in the Eastern Conference, going 30–13–5 in the lockout-shortened season. In the playoffs, the Nordiques were upset by the eighth-seeded New York Rangers in six games. After the season, the Nordiques franchise relocated to Denver, Colorado and became the Colorado Avalanche.

Martin moved with the team to Colorado in 1995–96, however, he left the Avalanche on January 24, 1996, to become head coach of the Ottawa Senators.

====Ottawa Senators (1996–2004)====
Martin joined the Ottawa Senators midway through the 1995–96 season, taking over a club that had a record of 8–35–1. Martin coached his first game as the Senators&#x27; head coach on January 24, 1996, losing 4–3 to the Pittsburgh Penguins. After going winless in his first three games, he earned his first win with Ottawa on January 29, 1996, defeating his former team, the St. Louis Blues 4–2. The club improved slightly under Martin, as he led the team to a 10–24–4 record over their final 38 games, as Ottawa missed the playoffs. A highlight for the team was on April 13, 1996, when the Senators defeated the defending Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils 5–2, eliminating the Devils from the postseason, who needed a victory to make the playoffs.

The Senators improved greatly in 1996–97, as Ottawa finished the year with a 31–36–15 record, making the postseason for the first time in team history. In the postseason, the Senators took the heavily favoured Buffalo Sabres to overtime in game seven, before losing the game 1–0, and the series.

Ottawa continued to improve in 1997–98, as the team finished with a winning record for the first time, going 34–33–15, and making the postseason once again. In the playoffs, the eighth-seeded Senators stunned the New Jersey Devils in the first round, defeating them in six games. In the second round, Ottawa lost to the Washington Capitals in five games.

The Senators had the best record in the Northeast Division in 1998–99, going 44–23–15, earning 103 points. Martin was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best head coach in the NHL. In the playoffs, the Senators were swept by the Buffalo Sabres, quickly ending their season.

Ottawa had another strong regular season in 1999–2000, going 41–28–11–2, finishing second in the Northeast Division. The Senators faced their provincial rivals, the Toronto Maple Leafs, in the first round of the playoffs, as the underdog Leafs defeated the Senators in six games.

The club had a very strong season in 2000–01, as Ottawa finished with their second Northeast Division title in three years, going 48–21–9–4, earning 109 points, and second in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, the Senators faced the Toronto Maple Leafs for the second consecutive season, and once again, the Maple Leafs pulled off the upset, sweeping the heavily favoured Senators in four games.

The Senators struggled at times during the 2001–02, as the club dealt away top player Alexei Yashin to the New York Islanders during the off-season. Martin coached the Senators for their first 80 games, going 38–26–9–7. Martin stepped aside for the final two games, allowing assistant coach Roger Neilson to head coach the team, so Neilson could get to 1,000 games as a head coach. Martin returned to the Senators bench in the playoffs, as Ottawa faced the Philadelphia Flyers in the opening round of the playoffs. The Senators defeated the Flyers in five games, setting up a third straight meeting with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round. Ottawa took Toronto to a seventh game, however, the team once again lost to their provincial rivals.

Ottawa finished the 2002–03 with the best record in the league, winning the Presidents&#x27; Trophy for the first time in team history, with a 52–21–8–1 record, earning 113 points. In the postseason, the Senators defeated the New York Islanders in five games in the first round, followed by a six-game series win over the Philadelphia Flyers, as the team reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in club history. In the series against the New Jersey Devils, Ottawa fell behind three games to one, however, the Senators rallied to tie the series, setting up a seventh and deciding game. In the seventh game, the Senators lost the game, and series, on a late third period goal.

Heading into the 2003–04 season, the Senators were heavy favourites to win the Stanley Cup. The team had a very good regular season, going 43–23–10–6, earning 102 points, and fifth place in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Ottawa faced the Toronto Maple Leafs for their fourth playoff meeting in five years. The Leafs managed to defeat the Senators again, winning the series in seven games.

On April 22, 2004, the Senators fired Martin.

====Florida Panthers (2004–2009)====
Martin was hired as head coach of the Florida Panthers on May 26, 2004. Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the season was cancelled. Martin coached his first game with the Panthers on October 5, 2005, as the team defeated the Atlanta Thrashers 2–0. In his first year with the club in 2005–06, the Panthers went 37–34–11. However, the team failed to make the playoffs.

On September 3, 2006, the Panthers general manager, Mike Keenan, resigned from the position, and Martin took over the job while remaining the head coach. Florida once again missed the playoffs in 2006–07, as the club went 35–31–16. The Panthers continued to struggle in 2007–08, as Florida posted a 38–35–9 record, failing to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season under Martin. On April 11, 2008, the Panthers fired Martin as head coach, but he remained the general manager. Martin hired Peter DeBoer to become the head coach of the Panthers. As the general manager in 2008–09, the Panthers improved to a 41–30–11 record, earning 93 points, however, Florida once again failed to make the playoffs. On May 16, 2009, Martin resigned from his position.

====Montreal Canadiens (2009–2012)====
On June 1, 2009, Martin signed with the Montreal Canadiens to become their head coach, taking over the position from interim head coach Bob Gainey. Martin coached his first game with the Canadiens on October 1, defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–3 in overtime. The team finished the 2009–10 season with a 39–33–10 record, making the playoffs as the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. In the postseason, the Canadiens upset the top-seeded Washington Capitals in seven games in the first round. Montreal continued their playoff run by defeating the favoured Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games in the second round, reaching the Eastern Conference finals against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Canadiens struggled against Philadelphia, as they were shutout in three of their four losses, as the club lost in five games.

The Canadiens had a solid regular season in 2010–11 season, going 44–30–8, earning 96 points, an eight-point improvement over the previous season. In the playoffs, the Canadiens lost to their archrivals, the Boston Bruins in the first round, losing game seven in overtime to be eliminated.

Montreal struggled to begin the 2011–12 season, as the team had a 13–12–9 record in their first 34 games. On December 17, 2011, the Canadiens fired Martin and replaced him with assistant coach Randy Cunneyworth, who was once Martin&#x27;s captain on the Ottawa Senators, on an interim basis.

====Pittsburgh Penguins (2013–2020)====
Martin joined the Pittsburgh Penguins as an assistant coach under Dan Bylsma for the 2013–14 season, as he was hired for the position on August 9, 2013. In his first season with the club, the Penguins recorded a 51–24–7 record, earning 109 points, finishing in first place in the Metropolitan Division. The Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in six games in the first round, however, they lost to the New York Rangers in seven games in the second round.

On June 11, 2017, Martin won the Cup for the second time as the Penguins defeated the Nashville Predators in a 4–2 series win.

On August 12, 2020, the Penguins announced that Martin&#x27;s contract would not be renewed, ending his tenure with the team.

<text>Star Fox is an arcade style rail shooter, space flight simulator, and third person action-adventure video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto, developed and published by Nintendo. The games follow the Star Fox combat team of anthropomorphic animals, led by chief protagonist Fox McCloud. Gameplay involves many adventures around the Lylat planetary system in the futuristic Arwing fighter aircraft, in other vehicles, and on foot. The original &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993) is a forward-scrolling 3D rail shooter, but later games add more directional freedom.

The first game in the series, developed by Nintendo EAD and programmed by Argonaut Software, uses the Super FX Chip to create the first hardware-accelerated 3D gaming experience on a home console. The Super FX Chip is a math co-processor built into the cartridge to help the Super NES render graphics. Super FX has been used in other Super NES games, some with increased processing speed. Its reboot, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, is the first Nintendo 64 game with Rumble Pak support.

Due to perceived issues with the German company StarVox, &quot;Star Fox&quot; and &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; were released in PAL region territories as &quot;Starwing&quot; and &quot;Lylat Wars&quot; respectively. However, as of &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, Nintendo uses the same name globally.

==Games==

=== Main series ===
====&quot;Star Fox&quot;====

The first game, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, or &quot;Starwing&quot; in Europe and Australia, was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. Developed by Nintendo EAD and programmed by Argonaut Software, it uses the Super FX chip to provide 3D graphics during a period of predominately 2D games. Fox McCloud and his team, Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi, take on Andross, who threatens to overthrow the Lylat system. The concept was inspired by a shrine to the Japanese fox deity Inari Ōkami, which Shigeru Miyamoto visited regularly. The shrine&#x27;s accessibility through a series of arches, influenced the gameplay. Several boss battles from the game are included as mini-games in the Wii game &quot;&quot;, using the Wii Remote to fly the ship.

====&quot;Star Fox 64&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, or &quot;Lylat Wars&quot; in Europe and Australia, introduced fully spoken dialogue, off-the-rails movement, new vehicles and characters, multiplayer, and rudimentary on-foot gameplay through an unlockable multiplayer mode. It was released in 1997 for the Nintendo 64 and came bundled with the Rumble Pak, a force feedback controller attachment. &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; retells the main story of the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; canon, with new characters and gameplay elements. New multiplayer modes include free-for-all, battle royale, and a time trial.

The overall plot is expanded with relatively small core changes. This game is famous for quotes that have become Internet memes: &quot;Do a barrel roll!&quot; and &quot;Use bombs wisely&quot; by Peppy Hare and &quot;Can&#x27;t let you do that, Star Fox!&quot; by Wolf O&#x27;Donnell.

====&quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; is a remake of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, released in 2011, as the second &quot;Star Fox&quot; game on a handheld console. The game was announced in a conceptual trailer for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2010.

With a few exceptions, the gameplay in &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; is very similar to that of the original version. The player controls Fox&#x27;s Arwing fighter using the circle pad to steer, the shoulder buttons to bank left and right, and the four right-hand buttons to fire lasers and bombs, boost and brake. The D-Pad allows the player to perform somersaults and u-turns, which can also be performed with combinations of other controls, and to zoom in and out from the Arwing in &quot;All-Range Mode&quot;. The player can enable &quot;Gyro Controls&quot;, using the 3DS&#x27;s internal gyroscope sensor to control the Arwing. Character dialogue, messages and control information are displayed on the touch screen.

A new multiplayer &quot;Battle Mode&quot; allows up to 4-player LAN multiplayer (via Download Play), or to battle against CPU opponents. During battles, each player&#x27;s face appears on opponents&#x27; screens in a live reaction feed from the console&#x27;s internal camera.

====&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was released in 2002 for the GameCube. Developed by Rare, it is predominately an action-adventure game in which Fox is armed with a mystical staff. Traditional space shooting is limited to small segments between chapters. Its roots can be traced to &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;, a game Rare was developing late in the life cycle of the Nintendo 64, but cancelled by Nintendo and converted into a &quot;Star Fox&quot; game. It introduced new characters, including Prince Tricky and Krystal. Taking place eight years after the events of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, the main antagonist is an army of dinosaurs called the Sharp Claws, led by General Scales. Fox and Krystal fall in love soon before the final boss fight when Fox saves her life. Krystal then becomes the Star Fox team&#x27;s newest member. The gameplay of &quot;Adventures&quot; resembles that seen in most 3D &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; games.

====&quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;====

Developed by Namco, &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; was released in 2005 for the GameCube. The emphasis returned to Arwing-based gameplay, but also had portions of on-foot missions. &quot;Assault&quot; takes place one year after &quot;Adventures&quot;, with the Aparoids becoming a new threat to the Lylat system. The Star Fox team is tasked with stopping them. Along with ROB, Peppy now pilots the Great Fox, while Krystal replaces Peppy&#x27;s role as one of the team&#x27;s pilots.

====&quot;Star Fox Command&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox Command&quot; was developed by Q-Games for the Nintendo DS, and was released in 2006. It is the first &quot;Star Fox&quot; game for a handheld console and the first to offer online multiplayer. Like the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, gameplay is completely aircraft-based, and uses chatter much like the SNES game instead of the voice acting of later installments. &quot;Command&quot; utilizes a new system of gameplay, incorporating strategy and abandoning its &quot;fly-by-rail&quot; roots. Players plot flight paths and engage enemies in an open arena-style flying mode using the Nintendo DS&#x27;s touch screen. Each character has a unique ship with different abilities. For example, Slippy&#x27;s ship has no lock-on feature and shorter boosts, but has stronger lasers and shielding; Fox McCloud pilots the redesigned Arwing II. &quot;Command&quot; takes place two to three years after the events of &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; and features possible nine endings, determined by the player&#x27;s story progression choices.

====&quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; was developed by Nintendo and PlatinumGames for the Wii U and released in April 2016. The first &quot;Star Fox&quot; game on a home game console in over 10 years, the game is controlled using the Wii U GamePad&#x27;s gyroscope feature. &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; also came packaged with a retail version of &quot;Star Fox Guard&quot;, a tower defense spin-off game.

====&quot;Star Fox 2&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was originally cancelled even though it was completely finished. Many of its new ideas were implemented for the then-forthcoming &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, such as the rival team Star Wolf, all-range mode, charge shot, and a multiplayer mode (though &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;″s multiplayer mode was no longer featured in the final beta). Other elements such as choosing characters, map pointing, and multiple ship variations were later implemented in &quot;Star Fox Command&quot;. A beta version of the Landmaster tank (the Walker) also makes an appearance as an Arwing with leglike attachments. A patch for the final beta was released by a third-party team of hackers to make the game complete, removing the debug mode menus, making an English translation, and removing subroutines for a buggy third vehicle not used in the game.

The game was officially released as part of the Super NES Classic Edition.

===Cancelled games===
====Virtual Boy game====
This game was a tech demo of what would have been a &quot;Star Fox&quot; game had the Virtual Boy adopted the series. The closest game to it is &quot;Red Alarm&quot;. Cinematic camera angles were a key element, as they are in &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;. At both E3 1995 and at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show 1995, the demo showed an Arwing doing various spins and motions. One observer called it &quot;an intriguing technical demo featuring a &quot;Star Fox&quot;-like spacecraft doing a lot of spinning and zooming in 3D. It is made of filled polygons and looks much better than the unfilled &quot;Red Alarm&quot; vehicles&quot;. Attendees to these two events were given 3D glasses to watch the demos and tech videos that were played on screens at the show floors, and from these videos.

====Arcade game====
Originally planned as a companion game for &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;, an arcade game was abandoned and never released. It was scheduled for release in 2004–2005, but was cancelled for unknown reasons.

===Spin-off games===
====&quot;Star Fox&quot; (Nelsonic Game Watch)====
Shortly after the release of the first &quot;Star Fox&quot; game, in June 1993, Nintendo teamed up with Kellogg&#x27;s and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional LCD-based &quot;Star Fox&quot; Game Watch coupon in boxes of Corn Flakes. It has four levels and the object is to fly toward the Attack Carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. It includes a pair of earphones and a headphone jack for listening to the game without disturbing anyone nearby due to the game watch missing a volume control. Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance.

====&quot;Star Fox Guard&quot;====

&quot;Star Fox Guard&quot; was first shown at E3 2014 under the name of &quot;Project Guard&quot;, and was announced under a final name in a March 2016 Nintendo Direct. &quot;Guard&quot; was released for the Wii U in April 2016, coinciding with the release of &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;. Developed by Nintendo and PlatinumGames, &quot;Guard&quot; is a tower defense game where the objective is to switch between different views on security cameras and protect the player&#x27;s base by shooting enemy robots. A physical version of the game came bundled alongside the physical version of &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, and is also available separately as a digital download on the Wii U eShop.

===Related games===
====&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series====
Various &quot;Star Fox&quot; characters and stage themes have appeared in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; franchise of fighting games. Fox McCloud has appeared in every series entry as a playable character, while Falco Lombardi has been unlockable in all games from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; onward. Wolf O&#x27;Donnell appears as an unlockable fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

====&quot;WarioWare&quot; series====
In &quot;&quot; for Wii, there is a &quot;Star Fox&quot; minigame in the style of the SNES title with three stages. Using the Wii Remote, the player pilots the Arwing through Corneria, Sector X, and Titania. At the end of each level, the player fights R.O.B. (not ROB 64 from the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series, but rather the R.O.B. attachment for the NES), who is armed with a large NES Zapper. In &quot;WarioWare Gold&quot; for Nintendo 3DS, another SNES-styled Star Fox microgame appears, this time challenging players to not crash into anything when their ship is on the verge of being destroyed.

====&quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;====
Fox, Falco, Peppy, and Slippy, along with the Arwing Walker from &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, appear as Mystery Mushroom costumes in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;.

====&quot;Starlink: Battle for Atlas&quot;====
The Nintendo Switch version of Ubisoft&#x27;s action-adventure game &quot;&quot; features exclusive missions featuring &quot;Star Fox&quot; characters and ships. As part of the game&#x27;s toys-to-life features, the Nintendo Switch starter pack includes figures of Fox McCloud and his Arwing that can be used in-game.

==Other media==
===&quot;Nintendo Power&quot; comics===
A monthly &quot;Star Fox&quot; comic strip, illustrated by Benimaru Itoh, was printed in issues 45 to 55 of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; in 1993. It is an adaptation of the events of the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, with some exclusive characters not seen in any of the games to date. One such character is Fara Phoenix, a vixen who becomes the fifth member of Star Fox after they saved her from Venomian forces, who forms a close relationship with Fox. The story follows the Star Fox team as they went from outlaws on Papetoon, to an elite Arwing fighter squadron. Fox, Falco, and Andross were the only 3 characters whose backgrounds were fully explained in the story. A sequel set after the events of the game was produced in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; by the same team which continued the story, featuring Andross&#x27;s DNA being split between two clones. The clones then begin an invasion of the Lylat system, laying waste to everything in their path. The Star Fox team springs back into action, while Fara— dressed in clothing once worn by Fox&#x27;s deceased mother, as the team had been enjoying some down time when the invasion begins— manages to provide an accidental, yet significant, distraction to one of the Andross clones when he spots her on a monitor due to a revelation that the original Andross was in love with Fox&#x27;s mother and accidentally murdered her with a bomb intended for Fox&#x27;s father, which the clone says over a loudspeaker, as the clone believes he is speaking to the deceased vixen, rather than Fara. Enraged by this new knowledge, Fox battles his way through the forces of Andross&#x27;s clones, one of whom slays the other as he considers the feelings of the one who believes Fara to be Fox&#x27;s mother is a weakness that is unneeded, and destroys the survivor. The story ends with the Lylat system celebrating the ultimate defeat of Andross as what remains of his forces flee from the forces of Corneria and the surviving fighters of the other worlds in the system.

===&quot;Lylat Wars Comic&quot;===
The official &quot;Club Nintendo&quot; magazine in Germany released a &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; comic drawn manga-style to retell the game&#x27;s storyline. The comic shows some scenes that were not present in the game—for instance, Wolf kicking Andrew and Pigma out of Star Wolf because they acted against his orders (and thus saving Star Fox from the plot of the two). The comic ends with a robotic Andross being defeated.

===Manga===
A one-issue &quot;Star Fox&quot; comic by Kazumi Sakamoto (坂本かずみ) was printed in the &quot;Comic Bonbon&quot; 1993 Spring Vacation Jumbo Edition (春休みジャンボ増刊号), published in April of that month.

A one-issue &quot;Star Fox&quot; comic by was printed in the 1993 Spring Break Edition (増刊号 ９３年春休み増刊) of &quot;Corocoro Comic&quot;.

A &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; comic by Takahiro Yamashita is within the April and June 1997 issues of &quot;Bessatsu Corocoro Comic&quot;.

===&quot;Star Fox: Farewell, Beloved Falco&quot;===
Star Fox: Farewell, Beloved Falco is a Japanese manga created by Nintendo, and part of the main &quot;Star Fox&quot; series. The manga was released on the official &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; Japanese website, serves to bridge the events of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; and &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot;, explaining Falco&#x27;s absence from the team in the latter game. 

In the series, Captain Shears runs a base on the sand-dune planet Titania, but unbeknownst to Star Fox, Shears is actually taking part in an experiment to resurrect Andross. In the beginning, Katt Monroe returns from &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; along with a rag-tag team of roughnecks with apparently an inside lead on the fact that Shears is evil. Fox remains unconvinced, which ends up in a sparring match between him and Falco, thus adding more emphasis into Falco&#x27;s intentions of leaving Star Fox. Eventually, it is revealed to Star Fox that Shears is indeed evil, and Fox storms in to stop the resurrection plan once and for all. The manga ends with the Star Fox team learning of Dinosaur Planet&#x27;s broken state and choosing to investigate, as in the opening sequence of &quot;Adventures&quot;.

===&quot;Star Fox Zero – The Battle Begins&quot;===
A 14-minute web video of &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, Production IG and Wit Studio, features the Star Fox team in an anime-styled battle of the first level in &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;: Corneria. The short was later released via the Wii U eShop as part of the &quot;Star Fox Zero: The Battle Begins + Training&quot; demo.

===Cancelled TV series===
In an interview with &quot;The Serf Times&quot;, comedian and television host, Adam Conover revealed that back in February 2015, him and other members of CollegeHumor were working along with Shigeru Miyamoto to produce a clay-animated show of the series. However, the project was cancelled a month later by Nintendo after plans for a series based on &quot;Legend of Zelda&quot; were leaked by Netflix.

==Recurring elements==
===Arwing===
The Arwing is the principal craft of the Star Fox team, and has appeared in all &quot;Star Fox&quot; games to date.

The Arwing has had considerable changes, though all versions of it retain a basic shape: a central fuselage, two crested streamlined pods attached at the sides, known as Gravity Diffusers, or G Diffusers, and wings mounted on the side pods. From &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; onwards, the two side pods are a distinctive blue color.

The Arwings make an appearance in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. In this series, Arwings are used by Fox and Falco as their on-screen introduction, in addition to being used as a stage obstacle on Fox&#x27;s Level, Sector Z. The Arwings on this stage would occasionally fly through and shoot lasers at the players. While Sector Z did not return in future titles, the stage Corneria is very similar to it and also features Arwings. In the Venom, Lylat Cruise, and Orbital Gate Assault stages they are seen flying in the background. Additionally Arwings are featured as collectible trophies in certain &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; games. The Arwing is also an easter egg in &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; but can only be accessed by a gameshark code. It appears in Kokiri forest as an enemy who can be defeated by Link with either a boomerang, fairy bow, or fairy slingshot. Once defeated, they fall to the ground, explode and its blast may inadvertently kill Link. The Arwing also appears as a piece of furniture in &quot;Animal Crossing: Wild World&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing: City Folk&quot;. When touched by the game character, the Arwing will briefly play the &quot;Star Fox&quot; theme music. It also appears over a box in &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, Hinopio&#x27;s Market, but it&#x27;s just a decor. In &quot;Bayonetta 2&quot;, miniature Arwings replace Bayonetta&#x27;s guns when she is wearing the game&#x27;s unlockable Star Fox costume. In addition, the plane in the final level is also replaced with an Arwing.

Miyamoto explains that the craft is called Arwing &quot;because it was like one big wing shaped like an A&quot;.

===Landmaster===
The Landmaster M1 tank first appeared in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; (1997, Nintendo 64) as a tracked light tank in two of the game&#x27;s missions and one of the game&#x27;s multiplayer maps. It appears in &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; (2005, GameCube), though with some changes, including the substitution of tank treads with tires. The Landmaster tank appears in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; (2008, Wii) as the Final Smash for Fox, Falco, and Wolf. In &quot;Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot; (2014, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U) it is the Final Smash for Fox and Falco.

===Wolfen===
The Wolfen is piloted by Wolf O&#x27;Donnell. This ship would have first appeared in &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, but was instead first seen in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; on the planet Fichina (mistranslated as Fortuna in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, fixed in &quot;64 3D&quot;) – or alternatively – Bolse. Additionally, taking the hard path to Venom enables the player to battle the Wolfen II, which outperforms the Arwing. In &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot;, Team Star Wolf piloted the original versions of the Wolfen against the Star Fox team, and they are playable in the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode. The Wolfen has appeared throughout the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==Reception==

The &quot;Star Fox&quot; series has had mostly positive reviews, the most acclaimed being &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, and &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot; received the most mixed reviews. &quot;Star Fox&quot; took the No. 115 spot on &quot;EGM&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time&quot;, and 82nd best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list. It also received a 34 out of 40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine, and a 4.125 out of 5 from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Magazine. &quot;Next Gen Magazine&quot; pointed out &quot;Star Fox&quot; as helping pioneer the use of 3-D video game graphics. The game has been used as an example of how, even with a fully polygon design, the game was still very similar to older games in that there was a set path to travel through each level.

As &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; took a different approach to the franchise, many fans complained it was too much like a role-playing adventure game, such as &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. Regardless, it was critically praised. In an &quot;IGN&quot; poll for voting from a list of ten Nintendo characters for favorite Nintendo character of all time, Fox came in fourth, behind Link, Mario, and Samus respectively.

In October 2009, Shigeru Miyamoto said that he was disappointed that sales of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series in Japan had decreased during the preceding period.

Because of the popularity of the series, Google introduced an Easter egg. Typing &quot;do a barrel roll&quot; or &quot;Z or R twice&quot; into the search bar, the screen rotates 360°.

<text>The Julian Alps (, , , , ) are a mountain range of the Southern Limestone Alps that stretches from northeastern Italy to Slovenia, where they rise to 2,864 m at Mount Triglav, the highest peak in Slovenia. A large part of the Julian Alps is included in Triglav National Park. The second highest peak of the range, the 2,755 m high Jôf di Montasio, lies in Italy.

The Julian Alps cover an estimated 4,400 km2 (of which 1,542 km2 lies in Italy). They are located between the Sava Valley and Canale Valley. They are divided into the Eastern and Western Julian Alps.

==Name==
The Julian Alps were known in antiquity as &quot;Alpes Iuliae&quot;, and also attested as &quot;Alpes Julianae&quot; AD 670, &quot;Alpis Julia&quot; 734, and &quot;Alpes Iulias&quot; in 1090. Like the municipium of &quot;Forum Julii&quot; (now Cividale del Friuli) at the foot of the mountains, the range was named after Julius Caesar of the gens Julia, perhaps due to a road built by Julius Caesar and completed by Augustus.

==Eastern Julian Alps==

There are many peaks in the Eastern Julian Alps over 2,000 m high, and they are mainly parts of ridges. The most prominent peaks are visible by their height and size. There are high plateaus on the eastern border, such as Pokljuka, Mežakla, and Jelovica.

The main peaks by height are the following:
* Triglav – the highest mountain and on the coat of arms of Slovenia 
* Škrlatica 
* Mangart 
* Jalovec 
* Razor 
* Kanjavec 
* Prisojnik 
* Rjavina 
* Prestreljenik 
* Špik 
* Tosc 
* Krn 

==Western Julian Alps==
The Western Julian Alps cover a much smaller area, and are located mainly in Italy. Only the Kanin group lies in part in Slovenia.
The main peaks by height are:
* Jôf di Montasio ()
* Jôf Fuart ()
* High Mount Kanin ()
* Jôf di Miezegnot ()

== Passes ==
Important passes of the Julian Alps are:
*The Vršič Pass, 1,611 m (5,826 feet), links the Sava and Soča valleys. It is the highest mountain road pass in Slovenia.
*The Predil Pass (links Villach via Tarvisio and Bovec to Gorizia), paved road 1,156 m (3,792 feet)
*The Pontebba Pass (links Villach via Tarvisio and Pontebba to Udine), railway, paved road, 797 m (2,615 feet)

<doc id="246359" wikidata="Q312938" url="?curid=246359" title="Ottokar I of Bohemia">
<text>Ottokar I (; 1155 – 1230) was Duke of Bohemia periodically beginning in 1192, then acquired the title of King of Bohemia, first in 1198 from Philip of Swabia, later in 1203 from Otto IV of Brunswick and in 1212 (as hereditary) from Frederick II. He was an eminent member of the Přemyslid dynasty.

==Early years==
Ottokar&#x27;s parents were Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia, and Judith of Thuringia. His early years were passed amid the anarchy that prevailed everywhere in the country. After several military struggles, he was recognized as ruler of Bohemia by Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI in 1192. He was, however, soon overthrown for joining a conspiracy of German princes to bring down the Hohenstaufen dynasty. In 1197, Ottokar forced his brother, Duke Vladislaus III, to abandon Bohemia to him and to content himself with Moravia.

Taking advantage of the civil war in Germany between the Hohenstaufen claimant Philip of Swabia and the Welf candidate Otto IV, Ottokar declared himself King of Bohemia in 1198, being crowned in Mainz. This title was supported by Philip of Swabia, who needed Czech military support against Otto.

In 1199, Ottokar divorced his wife Adelheid of Meissen, a member of the Wettin dynasty, to marry Constance of Hungary, the young daughter of Hungarian King Béla III.

In 1200, with Otto IV in the ascendancy, Ottokar abandoned his pact with Philip of Swabia and declared for the Welf faction. Otto IV and later Pope Innocent III subsequently accepted Ottokar as the hereditary King of Bohemia.

==Golden Bull of Sicily==

Ottokar was quickly forced back into Philip&#x27;s camp by the imperial declaration of a new duke of Bohemia, Děpolt III. Subject to his recognition as duke, Ottokar had to allow his divorced wife to return to Bohemia. Having been completed this condition, he again ranged himself among Philip&#x27;s partisans and still later was among the supporters of the young King Frederick II. In 1212 Frederick granted the Golden Bull of Sicily to Bohemia. This document recognised Ottokar and his heirs as Kings of Bohemia. The king was no longer subject to appointment by the emperor and was only required to attend Diets close to the Bohemian border. Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian king was to be the leading electoral prince of the Holy Roman Empire and to furnish all subsequent emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation.

Ottokar&#x27;s reign was also notable for the start of German immigration into Bohemia and the growth of towns in what had until that point been forest lands. In 1226, Ottokar went to war against Duke Leopold VI of Austria after the latter wrecked a deal that would have seen Ottokar&#x27;s daughter (Saint Agnes of Bohemia) married to Frederick II&#x27;s son Henry II of Sicily. Ottokar then planned for the same daughter to marry Henry III of England, but this was vetoed by the emperor, who knew Henry to be an opponent of the Hohenstaufen dynasty. The widowed emperor himself wanted to marry Agnes, but by then she did not want to play a role in an arranged marriage. With the help of the pope, she entered a convent.

==Family==

Ottokar was married first in 1178 to Adelheid of Meissen (after 1160 - 2 February 1211), who gave birth to the following children:
* Vratislav of Bohemia (d. bef. 1225).
* Dagmar of Bohemia (d. 24 May 1212), married to King Valdemar II of Denmark.
* Božislava of Bohemia (d. 6 Feb bef. 1238), married to Count Henry I of Ortenberg.
* Hedvika of Bohemia, became a nun in Gernrode.

In 1199, he married secondly to Constance of Hungary (1181 – 6 December 1240), who gave birth to the following children:
* Vratislav of Bohemia (c. 1200 – bef. 1209).
* Judith of Bohemia (Judita) (- 2 June 1230), married to Bernhard von Spanheim, Duke of Carinthia.
* Anne of Bohemia (Anna Lehnická) (1204 - 23 June 1265), married to Henry II the Pious, High Duke of Poland.
* Anežka of Bohemia, died young.
* Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Václav I.) (c. 1205 - 23 September 1253), became King of Bohemia.
* Vladislaus of Bohemia (Vladislav) (1207 - 18 February 1227), Margrave of Moravia.
* Přemyslid (Přemysl) of Bohemia (1209 - 16 October 1239), Margrave of Moravia, married to Margaret of Merania, daughter of Otto I, Duke of Merania.
* Saint Agnes of Bohemia (Anežka Česká) (20 January 1211 – 6 March 1282)
The Milanese mystic Guglielma (1210s – 24 October 1281) claimed to be a Princess of Bohemia and has therefore been identified as a daughter of Ottokar and Constance with the name Vilemína or Božena, but there is an absence of any corroborating Bohemian documents.

<doc id="246363" wikidata="Q620588" url="?curid=246363" title="Terminator (franchise)">
<text>Terminator is an American media franchise created by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It is considered to be of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction. The franchise primarily focuses on a post-apocalyptic war between a synthetic intelligence known as Skynet, and a surviving resistance of humans led by John Connor. Skynet fights with an arsenal of cyborgs known as Terminators, designed to mimic humans and infiltrate the resistance. A prominent model throughout the films is the T-800, commonly known as the Terminator and portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Time travel is a common aspect of the franchise, with humans and Terminators often sent back to alter the past and change the outcome of the future.

The franchise began with the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot;, written and directed by Cameron, with Hurd as producer. They would return for the 1991 sequel &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (or &quot;T2&quot;). Both films were critical and commercial successes. Subsequent installments, most of them produced without Cameron&#x27;s involvement, saw mixed reviews and diminishing box-office returns. &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (or &quot;T3&quot;) was released in 2003 to positive reviews, followed by &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; in 2009 to more negative reviews. &quot;Salvation&quot; was intended as the first in a new trilogy, which was later scrapped after the film rights were sold.

Cameron was consulted for the 2015 film &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, a reboot branching off from the timeline of the original film. It was negatively received and performed poorly at the box-office. Cameron had a larger role as a producer of the 2019 film &quot;&quot;, a direct sequel to &quot;T2&quot; that ignores the three preceding films. &quot;Genisys&quot; and &quot;Dark Fate&quot;, respectively, were also produced as the first installment in a planned trilogy, but both were cancelled due to poor box-office performances, despite the latter film garnering a better reception.

Outside of the films, Cameron co-directed &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;, a 1996 theme park attraction. It was produced as the original sequel to &quot;T2&quot; and reunited its main cast. A television series, &quot;&quot;, was developed without Cameron&#x27;s involvement and aired from 2008 to 2009. It was also produced as a &quot;T2&quot; sequel, taking place in an alternate timeline that ignores the third film and subsequent events. &quot;Terminator Zero&quot;, an anime series, premiered in August 2024. The franchise has also inspired several lines of comic books since 1988, and numerous video games since 1991. By 2010, the franchise had generated $3 billion in revenue.

==Themes and setting==
The central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning, synthetic intelligence that is Skynet. Skynet is positioned in the first film, &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), as a U.S. strategic &quot;Global Digital Defense Network&quot; computer system by Cyberdyne Systems which becomes self-aware. Shortly after activation, Skynet seemingly perceives all humans as a threat to its existence and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear first strike against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating second strike and a nuclear holocaust which wipes out much of humanity in the resulting nuclear war. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the Terminators used against individual human targets and thereafter proceeds to wage a persistent total war against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the capability of time travel and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events or by preventing the apocalyptic timeline.

===Judgment Day===
In the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical Day of Judgment) is the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, in which case its creators panic and attempt to deactivate the network. As a result, Skynet perceives humanity as a threat and attempts to exterminate them. Skynet launches an all-out nuclear attack on Russia in order to provoke a nuclear counter-strike against the United States, knowing this will eliminate its human enemies. Due to time travel and the consequent ability to change the future, several differing dates are given for Judgment Day. In &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991), Sarah Connor states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, this date is delayed following the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the same film.
Judgment Day has various different dates in different timelines of the subsequent films, as well as the television series, creating a multiverse of temporal phenomena. In &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003) and &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009), Judgment Day was postponed to July 2003. In &quot;&quot; (2008–2009), the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film delayed Judgment Day to April 21, 2011. In &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015), the fifth film in the franchise, Judgment Day was postponed to an unspecified day in October 2017, attributed to altered events in both the future and the past. Sarah and Kyle Reese travel through time to the year 2017 and seemingly defeat Skynet, but the system core, contained inside a subterranean blast shelter, survives unknown to them, thus further delaying, rather than preventing, Judgment Day. In &quot;&quot; (2019), the direct sequel to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, a date is not given for the new Judgment Day though it is named as such by Grace. Since Grace is a ten-year-old in 2020 and shown as a teenager in the post-Judgment Day world in flash-forwards throughout the film, Judgment Day occurs sometime in the early 2020s in this timeline.

==Franchise rights==
Before the first film was created, director James Cameron sold the rights for $1 to Gale Anne Hurd, his future wife, who produced the film, under the strict provision that he be allowed to direct it. Hemdale Film Corporation also became a 50-percent owner of the franchise rights, until its share was sold in 1990 to Carolco Pictures, a company founded by Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar. &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; was released a year later. Carolco filed for bankruptcy in 1995 and its library was subsequently acquired by StudioCanal, which continues to own the franchise today. However, the rights to future &quot;Terminator&quot; films were ultimately put up for auction. By that time, Cameron had become interested in making a &quot;Terminator 3&quot; film. The rights were ultimately auctioned to Vajna in 1997, for $8 million. Vajna and Kassar spent another $8 million to purchase Hurd&#x27;s half of the rights in 1998, becoming the full owners of the franchise. Hurd was initially opposed to the sale of the rights, while Cameron had lost interest in the franchise and a third film.

After the 2003 release of &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, the franchise rights were sold in 2007 for about $25 million to The Halcyon Company, which produced &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; in 2009. Later that year, the company faced legal issues and filed for bankruptcy, putting the franchise rights up for sale. The rights were valued at about $70 million. In 2010, the rights were sold for $29.5 million to Pacificor, a hedge fund that was Halcyon&#x27;s largest creditor. In 2012, the rights were sold to Megan Ellison and her production company Annapurna Pictures for less than $20 million, a lower price than what was previously offered. The low price was because of the possibility of Cameron regaining the rights in 2019, as a result of new North American copyright laws. Megan&#x27;s brother David Ellison and Skydance Productions produced &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; in 2015.

Cameron worked together with David Ellison to produce the 2019 film &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;. As the film neared its release, Hurd filed to terminate a copyright grant made 35 years earlier. Under this move, Hurd would again become a 50-percent owner of the rights with Cameron and Skydance could lose the rights to make any additional &quot;Terminator&quot; films beginning in November 2020, unless a new deal is worked out. Skydance responded that it had a deal in place with Cameron and that it &quot;controls the rights to the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise for the foreseeable future&quot;.

==Films==

===&quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984)===

&quot;The Terminator&quot; is a 1984 science fiction action film released by Orion Pictures, co-written and directed by James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. It is the first work in the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise. In the film, robots take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops android assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named John Connor starts the Tech-Com resistance to fight the machines, defeat Skynet and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines&#x27; only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John&#x27;s mother, Sarah Connor and prevent the boy&#x27;s birth, thereby stopping the resistance from being founded in the first place. With the fate of humanity at stake, John sends soldier Kyle Reese back to protect Sarah Connor and thus ensure his own existence. It was released on October 26, 1984 and grossed $78.4 million worldwide.

===&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991)===
&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; is the 1991 sequel to the original &quot;Terminator&quot; film and was released by TriStar Pictures. It was co-written, directed and produced by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick and Joe Morton. After robots fail to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attempting to terminate him as a child by using a more advanced Terminator, the T-1000. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, who is a doppelgänger to the one from 1984. After years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the robots used on her: preventing Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it. 

&quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; was released on July 3, 1991 to critical acclaim, becoming the most successful film at the US box office in 1991, and grossing $523.7 million worldwide. It won several Academy Awards, one most notably for its groundbreaking computer animation. The film was remastered for 3D and re-released in August 2017.

===&quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003)===

&quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, released by Warner Bros. Pictures in North America and Columbia TriStar Film Distributors internationally, is the 2003 sequel to &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and is written by John Brancato, Michael Ferris, directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nick Stahl, Claire Danes and Kristanna Loken. As a result of the destruction of Cyberdyne, the Skynet takeover has been postponed, not averted. In an attempt to ensure a victory by the robots, a new Terminator, the T-X, is sent back to terminate as many of John Connor&#x27;s future lieutenants as possible, including his future wife Kate Brewster and also John himself. Kate&#x27;s father, General Robert Brewster (David Andrews), who is supervising Skynet&#x27;s development, is also targeted for termination by the T-X. After Connor&#x27;s future self is terminated by a doppelgänger of his previous protector, Kate reprograms him and sends him back to save them both from the T-X. It was released on July 2, 2003 to generally favorable reviews and grossed $433.4 million worldwide.

===&quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; (2009)===

&quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; is the fourth installment of the &quot;Terminator&quot; film series, produced by The Halcyon Company and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Columbia Pictures. It was released on May 21, 2009 to negative reviews and grossed $371.4 million. It was written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, directed by McG, and stars Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington (who was personally recommended by James Cameron) as Marcus Wright. Following the events of &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, after Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader of humanity as he is destined, while Marcus Wright finds his place in an unfamiliar post-apocalyptic world. In this future, altered by the events of the second film, the T-800 Terminators (Roland Kickinger with CG-rendered facial likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger) are coming online sooner than expected. The film also stars Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, Common, Michael Ironside, and Helena Bonham Carter.

===&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; (2015)===
&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; is the fifth installment of the franchise and also serves as a reboot. It features the main characters from the first two films portrayed by a new cast, with the exception of Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the eponymous character. Additionally, J. K. Simmons joined the cast as Detective O&#x27;Brien, serving as an ally for the film&#x27;s protagonists. The film was written by Laeta Kalogridis and Patrick Lussier and directed by Alan Taylor. It was made by Skydance Productions and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The story takes place in an alternate reality resulting from a chain of events related to Skynet&#x27;s (Matt Smith) actions throughout a previous timeline. Prior to this alteration, on the verge of winning the war against Skynet, John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his trusted right-hand officer Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back through time to save his mother&#x27;s life and ensure his own existence. However, Kyle arrives at an alternate timeline where Skynet had never launched its initial attack in 1997 and Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) was brought up by a reprogrammed Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent by an unknown party to be her guardian ever since childhood. Now Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian need to escape the T-800 Model 101 (Brett Azar with CG-rendered likeness of Schwarzenegger from the first film), the T-1000 (Lee Byung-hun) and Skynet&#x27;s T-3000, in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from ever happening; while trying to uncover the secrets behind Cyberdyne Systems&#x27; new application software: &quot;Genisys&quot;. Assisting the trio is O&#x27;Brien, whose investigation into time travelers (especially Terminators) leads him to learn about Skynet and helps the protagonists in their mission to avert Judgment Day.

Cameron was consulted for the film during its early development. It was released in the U.S. on July 1, 2015 and grossed $440.6 million worldwide. Its commercial performance was lower than anticipated, resulting in two planned sequels and a spin-off television series being cancelled in favor of &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; (2019).

===&quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; (2019)===

&quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; is the sixth installment of the franchise and a direct sequel to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. It is directed by Tim Miller and was released in the U.S. on November 1, 2019. It stars Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, reprising their roles as Sarah Connor and the Terminator, respectively. The film also stars Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna. Jude Collie and Brett Azar were also cast as a young John Connor and a younger T-800, respectively.

The previous film, &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;, had been intended as the first in a new stand-alone film trilogy, but the planned sequels were canceled following the film&#x27;s disappointing box-office performance. The producer of that film, David Ellison, recruited James Cameron to produce a new film with him, which would become &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;.

In the film, the machines send a Terminator, Rev-9 (Luna), back in time to eliminate Dani Ramos (Reyes), whose destiny is linked to the Human Resistance&#x27;s war against them. The Resistance sends one of their soldiers, Grace (Davis), back to protect her, and a chain of events leads Grace and Dani to join forces with Sarah Connor and the T-800.

The writers&#x27; room included Josh Friedman, creator of the television series &quot;&quot;. Other writers included David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes and Billy Ray. The creative team stated that the new film would feature a young 18- to 21-year-old, who could potentially lead the franchise should the first film be successful. Miller made mention of creating a theme park attraction akin to &quot;T2 3-D: Battle Across Time&quot; should the film prove successful. Because the series deals with time-travel, the film ignores the premise of the last three films and the TV series and is not titled &quot;Terminator 6&quot;, as it is also a direct sequel to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. Filming began in Isleta del Moro, Almería on June 4, 2018, shooting for a month there, before shooting the rest in the United States.

This film was intended as the first in a new trilogy of &quot;Terminator&quot; films, but these plans were canceled due to very mixed audience reactions and the film&#x27;s underperforming box office record.

==Television==
===&quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot; (2008–2009)===

&quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot; follows Sarah (Lena Headey) and John Connor (Thomas Dekker) as they try to &quot;live under the radar&quot; after destroying Cyberdyne in &quot;Terminator 2&quot;. Summer Glau plays a Terminator named Cameron and Brian Austin Green plays Derek Reese, the brother of Kyle Reese, both sent back in time to protect the Connors and prevent another Judgment Day.

===&quot;Terminator Zero&quot; (2024)===

&quot;Terminator Zero&quot; is an anime series released on Netflix on August 29, 2024, notably referencing Judgment Day from the films. It is a co-production between Skydance and Production I.G. Unlike previous installments, the eight-episode series takes place in Japan without any ties to Sarah Connor or her son, John, instead focusing on new characters.

==Future==
In December 2022, while promoting &quot;&quot;, producer and director of the first two &quot;Terminator&quot; films James Cameron revealed that another series reboot was &quot;in discussion, but nothing has been decided&quot;. The reboot would likely feature an entirely new cast and reset the continuity of the entire film series. Cameron suggested that in hindsight, bringing back both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton for &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; had been a mistake. In May 2023, Schwarzenegger stated in an interview that he would not appear in any future franchise installments after the last few films were &quot;not well-written&quot;. Later that month, it was reported that Cameron was developing a script for a &quot;Terminator&quot; reboot.

In February 2024, Hamilton stated in an interview that she would also not appear in any more future installments feeling that she did all she could in the franchise and thought the story had been &quot;done to death&quot;. She also questioned the idea of rebooting the franchise again stating &quot;Why anybody would relaunch it is a mystery to me.&quot; In September 2024, Cameron confirmed that he was working on more films, in which the core themes are kept but the &quot;distinct iconography&quot; of the previous films is to be discarded.

==Web series==
===&quot;Terminator Salvation: The Machinima Series&quot; (2009)===

Set in 2016, years after Judgment Day, Blair Williams (voiced by Moon Bloodgood) is fighting the war against the machines in downtown Los Angeles, while tracking down the computer hacker named Laz Howard (voiced by Cam Clarke) and trying to persuade him to join sides with the resistance.

===&quot;Terminator Genisys: The YouTube Chronicles&quot; (2015)===
&quot;Terminator Genisys: The YouTube Chronicles&quot; was released in three parts on June 22, 2015 to promote the fifth film, produced by Heresy. The web series was directed by Charles Paek and written by Jay Bushman. It features several popular YouTube stars appearing with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800, as they stand together against the T-360 (played by fellow YouTube personality, Toby Turner).

===Cultural impact===
The &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise, most notably James Cameron&#x27;s original films, &quot;The Terminator&quot; and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, has had a significant impact on popular culture. The film franchise placed #17 on the top 25 greatest film franchises by IGN and is also in the top 30 highest-grossing franchises. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise is the sixth highest rated franchise on the site behind the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise, the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchise and the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, but in front of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise.

In 2008, &quot;The Terminator&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. The American Film Institute (AFI) has also recognized both films on a number of occasions: the line &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; from &quot;The Terminator&quot; placed as the 37th-best movie quote, while &quot;Hasta la vista, baby&quot; from &quot;Terminator 2&quot; ranked 76th on the same list. The Terminator character from &quot;The Terminator&quot; was voted the 22nd-greatest villain; meanwhile, the T-800 (of the same likeness) in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; was voted the 48th-greatest hero; this is the only time the same character has appeared on the two opposing lists. In the 100 Years...100 series list, the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise was voted the 42nd most thrilling. In addition, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; ranked 8th on AFI&#x27;s top 10 list in the science fiction genre. In 2023, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; was also selected for preservation.

Both films are the source of numerous pop culture references, such as the use of &quot;I&#x27;ll be back&quot; in countless other media, including different variations of the phrase by Arnold himself in many of his subsequent films and, in cameo appearances by Robert Patrick, as the T-1000, in &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; have also spoofed both films and the T-1000, in particular, on a number of occasions.

&quot;Terminator 2&quot; is the only film in the series to garner attention at the Academy Awards, with six nominations and four wins, and is rated highly among critics. In 2006 the readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; rated &quot;The Terminator&quot; as cinema&#x27;s 72nd best film and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; the 33rd.

The first five &quot;Terminator&quot; films have had very respectable box office gross, though after James Cameron left the series it saw diminishing returns in subsequent films. &quot;The Terminator&quot; made $78 million worldwide, far surpassing its $6 million budget and becoming a major sleeper hit. &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; grossed approximately $520 million globally, becoming a major blockbuster and the top-grossing film of 1991. &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; earned $433 million, making it the seventh highest-grossing film of 2003. &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; grossed an estimated $371 million worldwide, a figure below industry expectations. &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; grossed $440 million. &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; raised approximately $261 million worldwide with an estimated loss of $130 million, becoming the least successful film in the franchise and a box-office bomb.

Various novels have been released since 1985.

===Comics===
====&quot;The Terminator&quot; spin-off comics====
In 1988, NOW Comics published an ongoing series with John Connor as the main character in 2031, after sending Kyle Reese back to 1984 to protect his mother. The Terminators in this canon had more human-like endoskeletons and some issues would deal with subordinates of Connor&#x27;s in the ruins of certain geographic areas. The seventeen issue series was followed by two limited series.

Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights in 1990. In &quot;The Terminator&quot; (with &quot;Tempest&quot; added in trade paperbacks to distinguish itself from other comics), a group of human soldiers and four Terminators come to the present, to stop Skynet in differing ways. In the sequel, &quot;Secondary Objectives&quot;, the surviving Terminator is reprogrammed to destroy another Terminator sent to aid him and kill Sarah Connor. In its sequel, &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, a team of human assassins attempt to return to the past and kill a Skynet developer. The 1992 &quot;Endgame&quot; concludes this arc. Human colonel Mary Randall protects Sarah Connor as she goes into labor.

Dark Horse published a 1992 one-shot written by James Dale Robinson and drawn by Matt Wagner. Here, a female Terminator and a resistance fighter battle for the life of a woman named Sarah Connor, but not the correct one. The comic book had the unusual feature of a physical &quot;pop-up&quot; in one scene.

A 1993 limited series &quot;Hunters and Killers&quot;, set during the war, has special Terminators created to impersonate leaders in the Russian resistance. Another limited series, published in 1998, follows the misadventures of two malfunctioning Terminators in Death Valley. This set up the following year&#x27;s comic &quot;The Dark Years&quot;, set in 2030. In &quot;The Dark Years&quot;, a Terminator is sent to eliminate John Connor and his mother in 1999. In 2013, Dark Horse released a sequel comic based on the 2009 film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, entitled &quot;Terminator Salvation: The Final Battle&quot;.

Malibu Comics published twin series in 1995. One was a sequel to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, in which Sarah and John encounter two Terminators. The other was a prequel that explains the scenario. The conclusions to the series were published in one issue.

Beckett Comics published three series to promote &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot;, each consisting of two issues.

&quot;Terminator 2: Infinity&quot; (later simply &quot;Terminator Infinity&quot; (2007) comic book series by Dynamite Entertainment, was set in 2033. It was, for two issues, tied into another one of Dynamite&#x27;s publications, called &quot;Painkiller Jane&quot;.

Dynamite&#x27;s continuation, &quot;Terminator: Revolution&quot; and IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Salvation&quot; tie-in comic book were legally possible as the former was specifically based on the &quot;Terminator 2&quot; license.

====Crossover comics====
Terminators have crossed over with &quot;RoboCop&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot;. In &quot;RoboCop versus The Terminator&quot; (1992) and &quot;Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future&quot; (2000), the heroes must prevent the war-ravaged future.

In 2000&#x27;s &quot;Alien versus Predator versus The Terminator&quot; from Dark Horse, where Skynet, has reactivated farther in the future and is creating an Alien-Terminator hybrid. Ellen Ripley&#x27;s clone (from &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;) and the Predators join forces to stop Skynet.

In 2020, Dark Horse and IDW Publishing published &quot;Transformers vs. The Terminator&quot;, in which the Autobots and the Decepticons are antagonised by the T-800 as Skynet sends the Terminator back through time to destroy the Cybertronians and restore the future timeline.

===Collectible card game===

The Terminator Collectible Card Game was released in 2000 by Precedence.

===Role-playing game===
First announced in 2020 by Nightfall Games, &quot;The Terminator RPG&quot; was released in digital form on June 1, 2022, with a physical version following later in the year. The game is based on the first film and Dark Horse Comics line of graphic novels and comics.

===Theme park attractions===
T2-3D: Battle Across Time, a film ride based on the franchise, opened at Universal Studios Florida in 1996. The ride is presented as the original sequel to &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. It features Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick reprising their roles as the Terminator, Sarah Connor, John Connor, and the T-1000, respectively. James Cameron was one of three directors on the attraction, which marked his last major involvement with the franchise until &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;.

Terminator Salvation: The Ride operated at California&#x27;s Six Flags Magic Mountain from 2009 to 2010. Terminator X: A Laser Battle for Salvation operated at various locations beginning in 2009.

==Canceled projects==
===&quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; trilogy===
In May 2007, the production rights to the &quot;Terminator&quot; series had passed from the feuding of Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar to The Halcyon Company. The producers of the company hoped to start a new trilogy based on the franchise. However, due to the box office failure of the fourth film and legal troubles, the &quot;Salvation&quot; trilogy was ultimately cancelled. William Wisher, who co-wrote the first two films, had written material for a potential &quot;Terminator 5&quot; and &quot;Terminator 6&quot; that would follow on from the events of &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;. The two-part story would involve an element of time travel that brings back the deceased character of Sarah Connor, allowing her to interact with Kyle Reese beyond their initial meeting in the first film. Schwarzenegger would also reprise his role for the sixth film. The films would also include new Terminator villains from Skynet. Wisher had written a 24-page film treatment for &quot;Terminator 5&quot; and a four-page concept outline for &quot;Terminator 6&quot;.

===&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; trilogy===
By December 2013, there were plans for &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; to be the start of a new trilogy of films. In September 2014, Paramount announced release dates for the two &quot;Genisys&quot; sequels: May 19, 2017 and June 29, 2018. &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; producer David Ellison described the film and its intended trilogy as standalone projects based on Cameron&#x27;s original &quot;Terminator&quot; films. Ellison stated &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; is neither a sequel or a prequel to the previous films, saying: &quot;For us this is Terminator 1, this is not Terminator 5&quot;. The sequels to &quot;Genisys&quot; were tentatively known as &quot;Terminator 2&quot; and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;. The two sequels were to be filmed back to back during nine months of continuous shooting.

The storylines for the two sequels were devised by &quot;Genisys&quot; writers Kalogridis and Lussier. The trilogy was being planned out before &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; began filming, as producers David Ellison and Dana Goldberg wanted the full storyline finished ahead of time rather than having to &quot;figure it out as you go along&quot;, stating: &quot;We spent a lot of time breaking that down, and we do know what the last line of the third movie is, should we be lucky enough to get to make it&quot;. Production on the sequels was contingent on whether &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot; would be successful; development of the trilogy stalled in 2015 after the film&#x27;s disappointing box-office performance. The planned sequels were ultimately cancelled, with &quot;Terminator 2&quot; being removed from Paramount&#x27;s release schedule in January 2016.

The new trilogy would have explained who sent Pops back in time to protect Sarah Connor. In February 2015, Schwarzenegger stated he would reprise his role as Pops for the second film in the trilogy, with filming set to begin in 2016. Jai Courtney and Matt Smith would also reprise their respective roles as Kyle Reese and Skynet. J. K. Simmons would have had further involvement in the new trilogy, and Dayo Okeniyi would have a significant role reprising his character Danny Dyson in the second film, which would have focused on John Connor&#x27;s life after becoming part machine. Jason Clarke said about the cancelled &quot;Genisys&quot; sequel:
===&quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;–connected television series===
By December 2013, Skydance Productions and Annapurna Pictures were developing a new &quot;Terminator&quot; television series. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, who had worked together on &quot;Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles&quot;, were named as writers and executive producers. The series was to deviate from the franchise&#x27;s history at a critical moment in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Terminator&quot; and would also integrate with the planned sequels to &quot;Terminator Genisys&quot;.

===&quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; trilogy===
Plans for a new &quot;Terminator&quot; film trilogy were announced in July 2017. While working on the story for &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; that year, Cameron and the writers envisioned the film as the first in the new trilogy. They also worked out the basic storylines for each planned film.

In October 2019, Cameron stated that sequels to &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; would further explore the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence, while stating that a resolution between the two feuding sides would be the ultimate outcome. That month, Schwarzenegger stated that Cameron would write the &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; sequels and that Cameron would begin work on the next film in early 2020, for release in 2022.

Although the events of &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; erase Schwarzenegger&#x27;s T-800 character from existence, Cameron did not rule out the possibility of Schwarzenegger reprising the character: &quot;Look, if we make a shit ton of money with this film [&quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot;] and the cards say that they like Arnold, I think Arnold can come back. I&#x27;m a writer. I can think of scenarios. We don&#x27;t have a plan for that right now, let me put it that way&quot;. Natalia Reyes was to reprise her role for a sequel. Hamilton stated in October that she would probably reprise her role as well, although she joked that she would fake her own death to avoid appearing in it, saying that making &quot;Terminator: Dark Fate&quot; &quot;really was hard&quot; because of the physical training she had to undergo. Hamilton later said that she would be happy not to star in another &quot;Terminator&quot; film, but she kept the possibility open, with a potential exception being that a sequel be done on a smaller scale and budget.

&quot;Dark Fate&quot; director Tim Miller stated in November that he did not expect to return for a sequel. Production of a sequel was contingent on whether &quot;Dark Fate&quot; was a box-office success. Following the underwhelming performance of &quot;Dark Fate&quot; at the box-office (with an estimated loss of at least $120 million), sources close to Skydance told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that there are no plans for further films, effectively cancelling the planned &quot;Dark Fate&quot; trilogy.

<doc id="246367" wikidata="Q834358" url="?curid=246367" title="Clipper (programming language)">
<text>Clipper is an xBase compiler that implements a variant of the &quot;xBase&quot; computer programming language. It is used to create 
or extend software programs that originally operated primarily under MS-DOS. Although it is a powerful general-purpose programming
language, it was primarily used to create database/business programs.
One major dBase feature not implemented in Clipper is the dot-prompt (. prompt) interactive command set, which was an important part of the original dBase implementation.

Clipper, from Nantucket Corp and later Computer Associates, started out as a native code compiler for dBase III databases, and later evolved.

==History==
Clipper was created by Nantucket Corporation, a company that was started in 1984 by Barry ReBell (management) and Brian Russell (technical); 
Larry Heimendinger was Nantucket&#x27;s president. In 1992, the company was sold to Computer Associates for 190 million dollars and the product was renamed to CA-Clipper.

Clipper was created as a replacement programming language for Ashton Tate&#x27;s &quot;dBASE III&quot;, a very popular database language at the time. The advantage of Clipper over dBASE was that it could be compiled and executed under MS-DOS as a standalone application. In the years between 1985 and 1992, millions of Clipper applications were built, typically for small businesses dealing with databases concerning many aspects of client management and inventory management. For many smaller businesses, having a Clipper application designed to their specific needs was their first experience with software development. Also a lot of applications for banking and insurance companies were developed, here especially in those cases where the application was considered too small to be developed and run on traditional mainframes. In these environments Clipper also served as a front end for existing mainframe applications.

As the product matured, it remained a DOS tool for many years, but added elements of the C programming language and Pascal programming language, as well as OOP, and the code-block data-type (hybridizing the concepts of dBase macros, or string-evaluation, and function pointers), to become far more powerful than the original. Nantucket&#x27;s Aspen project later matured into the Windows native-code CA-Visual Objects compiler.

==Market penetration==
Nantucket sold well in Western markets. Also, in November 1991, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported the company&#x27;s success in &quot;painstakingly convincing Soviet software developers that buying is preferable to pirating&quot;. According to the article, Clipper had sold 2,000 copies in the Soviet Union (compared to 250,000 worldwide).

===Decline===
In the early 1990s, under new ownership, Clipper failed to transition from MS-DOS to Microsoft Windows. As a result, almost no new commercial applications were written in Clipper after 1995.

By then, the &quot;classically trained programmer&quot; commonly used strong typing, in contrast to the original dBASE language.
An evolution of Clipper, named VO, added strong typing but made it optional, in order to remain compatible with existing code.
Four of the more important languages that took over from Clipper were Visual Basic, Microsoft Access, Delphi, and Powerbuilder.
They all provided strong typing.

===Revival by third-parties===
The Clipper language is being actively implemented and extended by multiple organizations/vendors, like &quot;XBase++&quot; from Alaska Software and &quot;FlagShip&quot;, as well as free (GPL-licensed) projects like &quot;Harbour&quot; and &quot;xHarbour&quot;.

Many of the current implementations are portable (DOS, Windows, Linux (32- and 64-bit), Unix (32- and 64-bit), and macOS), supporting many language extensions, and have greatly extended runtime libraries, as well as various Replaceable Database Drivers (RDD) supporting many popular database formats, like DBF, DBTNTX, DBFCDX (FoxPro, Apollo, Comix, and Advantage Database Server), MachSix (SIx Driver and Apollo), SQL, and more. These newer implementations all strive for full compatibility with the standard dBase/xBase syntax, while also offering OOP approaches and target-based syntax such as codice_1.

===Usenet===
The Clipper Usenet newsgroups are comp.lang.clipper and comp.lang.clipper.visual-objects.

<doc id="246372" wikidata="Q3401860" url="?curid=246372" title="World War I in literature">
<text>Literature about World War I is generally thought to include poems, novels and drama; diaries, letters, and memoirs are often included in this category as well. Although the canon continues to be challenged, the texts most frequently taught in schools and universities are lyrics by Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen; poems by Ivor Gurney, Edward Thomas, Charles Sorley, David Jones and Isaac Rosenberg are also widely anthologized. Many of the works during and about the war were written by men because of the war&#x27;s intense demand on the young men of that generation; however, a number of women (especially in the British tradition) created literature about the war, often observing the effects of the war on soldiers, domestic spaces, and the home front more generally.

==General==
The spread of education in Britain in the decades leading up to World War I meant that British soldiers and the British public of all classes were literate. Professional and amateur authors were prolific during and after the war and found a market for their works.

Literature was produced throughout the war - with women, as well as men, feeling the &#x27;need to record their experiences&#x27; - but it was in the late 1920s and early 1930s that Britain had a boom in publication of war literature. The next boom period was in the 1960s, when there was renewed interest in World War I during the fiftieth anniversaries and after two decades focused on World War II.

==Poetry==

Published poets wrote over two thousand poems about and during the war. However, only a small fraction still is known today, and several poets that were popular with contemporary readers are now obscure. An orthodox selection of poets and poems emerged during the 1960s, which often remains the standard in modern collections and distorts the impression of World War I poetry. This selection tends to emphasize the horror of war, suffering, tragedy and anger against those that wage war.

In the early weeks of the war, British poets responded with an outpouring of literary production. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;For all we have and are&quot; was syndicated extensively by newspapers in English speaking countries. Robert Bridges contributed a poem &quot;Wake Up, England!&quot; at the outbreak of war that he later wished suppressed., John Masefield, who later succeeded Bridges as poet laureate, wrote &quot;August, 1914&quot;, a poem that was admired widely.

Wilfred Owen was killed in battle; but his poems created at the front did achieve popular attention after the war&#x27;s end, e.g., Dulce Et Decorum Est, Insensibility, Anthem for Doomed Youth, Futility and Strange Meeting. In preparing for the publication of his collected poems, Owen tried to explain:
 Epic poem In Parenthesis by David Jones (artist-poet) has also been widely hailed as a masterpiece.

The poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae continues to be one of the more popular wartime poems in Canada, and has achieved a status where it is recognized as one of the country&#x27;s most notable unofficial symbols.

The expressionist poet August Stramm wrote some of Germany&#x27;s important poems about the war.

From the war itself until the late 1970s, the genre of war poetry was almost exclusively reserved for male poets. This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley&#x27;s &quot;A War Film&quot;, Jessie Pope&#x27;s &quot;War Girls&quot;, Pauline B. Barrington&#x27;s &quot;Education&quot;, and Mary H.J. Henderson&#x27;s &quot;An Incident&quot;. In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists.

==Novels==
A common subject for fiction in the 1920s and 1930s was the effect of the war, including shell shock and the huge social changes caused by the war. From the latter half of the 20th century onward, World War I continued to be a popular subject for fiction, mainly novels.

=== Contemporary ===
Alfred Noyes is often portrayed by hostile critics as a militarist and jingoist despite being a pacifist in life. In 1913, when it seemed that war might yet be avoided, he published a long anti-war poem called &quot;The Wine Press&quot;. During World War I, Noyes was debarred by defective eyesight from serving at the front. Instead, from 1916, he did his military service on attachment to the Foreign Office, where he worked with John Buchan on propaganda. This included work as a literary figure, writing morale-boosting short stories and exhortatory odes and lyrics recalling England&#x27;s military past and asserting the morality of her cause. These works are forgotten today apart from two ghost stories, &quot;The &quot;Lusitania&quot; Waits&quot; and &quot;The Log of the Evening Star&quot;, which are still occasionally reprinted in collections of tales of the uncanny.

&quot;Im Westen nichts Neues&quot; (&quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;), Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s best-selling book about World War I, was translated into 28 languages with world sales nearly reaching 4 million in 1930. The work of fiction, and the award-winning film adaptation have had a greater influence in shaping public views of the war than the work of any historian. John Galsworthy&#x27;s perspective was quite different in 1915 when he wrote
::Those of us who are able to look back from thirty years hence on this tornado of death — will conclude with a dreadful laugh that if it had never come, the state of the world would be very much the same. It is not the intention of these words to deny the desperate importance of this conflict now that it has been joined ...

Remarque&#x27;s book was partly based on Henri Barbusse&#x27;s 1916 novel &quot;Under Fire&quot;. Barbusse was a French journalist who served as a stretcher-bearer on the front lines, and his book was very influential in its own right at the time. By the end of the war, it had sold almost 250,000 copies and read by servicemen of many nations.

American novelist, John Dos Passos, was a volunteer ambulance driver during the war. He wrote his first novel, the anti-war &quot;One Man&#x27;s Initiation: 1917&quot;, in the trenches (later published in 1920.) The book was reprinted in 1945, under the title &quot;First Encounter&quot;. His postwar war novel, &quot;Three Soldiers&quot;, brought him fame and critical recognition.

British novelist Mary Augusta Ward wrote generally pro-war novels, some at the request of United States President Theodore Roosevelt, which nevertheless raised questions about the war. These include &quot;England&#x27;s Effort&quot; (1916), &quot;Towards the Goal&quot; (1917), &quot;Missing&quot; (1917), &quot;The War and Elizabeth&quot; (1917) and &quot;Fields of Victory&quot; (1919).

Some pre-existing popular literary characters were placed by their authors in World War I-related adventures during or directly after the war. These include Tom Swift (&quot;Tom Swift and His Aerial Warship&quot; in 1915 and &quot;Tom Swift and His Air Scout&quot; in 1919), Sherlock Holmes (&quot;His Last Bow&quot;, 1917) and Tarzan (&quot;Tarzan the Untamed&quot;, 1920).

=== Post-war ===
A.P. Herbert was one of the first combatants to publish a novel about the war, &quot;The Secret Battle&quot; (1919). This was followed in subsequent years by others, including &quot;Through the Wheat&quot; (1923) by Thomas Alexander Boyd, the &quot;Spanish Farm Trilogy&quot;—&quot;Sixty-Four&quot; (1925), &quot;Ninety-Four&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Crime at Vanderlynden&#x27;s&quot; (1926)—by Ralph Hale Mottram, &quot;Death of a Hero&quot; (1929) by Richard Aldington, &quot;The Middle Parts of Fortune&quot; (1929) by Frederic Manning, &quot;The Patriot&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1930) by Henry Williamson, &quot;Generals Die in Bed&quot; by Charles Yale Harrison (1930) and &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1934) by Victor Maslin Yeates.

&quot;Parade&#x27;s End&quot; by Ford Madox Ford was a highly acclaimed tetralogy of novels, published between 1924 and 1927, that covers the events of World War I and the years around it from the viewpoint of a government statistician who becomes an officer in the British Army during the war. The novels were based on Ford&#x27;s own experience in the war after he had enlisted at age 41.

Willa Cather wrote &quot;One of Ours&quot; in 1922, and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for her novel that tells the story of Claude Wheeler, a Nebraska farmer who escapes a loveless marriage to fight in the War. Critics like H.L. Mencken and Sinclair Lewis panned the book, mostly because it romanticized war. Cather based Claude Wheeler on her cousin G.P. Cather, who was killed in 1918 at the Battle of Cantigny in France.

May Sinclair volunteered with the Munro Ambulance Corps in 1914 and published her account of the front in Belgium as &quot;A Journal of Impressions in Belgium&quot; (1915). She followed this with three novels about the war, &quot;Tasker Jevons&quot; (1916), &quot;The Tree of Heaven&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Romantic&quot; (1920). Journalist Evadne Price wrote a semi-biographical novel &quot;Not So Quiet: Stepdaughters of War&quot; (1930) about ambulance drivers based on women she had interviewed.

W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1928), a collection of short stories, was based on the author&#x27;s experience with British Intelligence during the war. It was loosely adapted into the film &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and a 1991 BBC TV series.

German author Hans Herbert Grimm wrote a novel &quot;Schlump&quot; in 1928 which was published anonymously due to its satirical and anti-war tone, loosely based on the author&#x27;s own experiences as a military policeman in German-occupied France during WW1. The novel was banned by the Nazis in 1933 and Grimm was not credited as the author until 2013.

British novelist W.F. Morris wrote two mystery novels set in the Great War- (1929) and &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; (1930). Morris served in the British army during the war.

&quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; is a novel by Ernest Hemingway set during the Italian campaign of World War I. The book, published in 1929, is a first-person account of American Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant (&quot;Tenente&quot;) in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army. The novel is about a love affair between the expatriate American Henry and Catherine Barkley against the backdrop of World War I, cynical soldiers, fighting and the displacement of populations. The publication of &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; cemented Hemingway&#x27;s stature as a modern American writer, became his first best-seller, and is described by biographer Michael Reynolds as &quot;the premier American war novel from that debacle World War I.&quot;

The popular literary characters Biggles and Bulldog Drummond were created by veterans of the war, W.E. Johns and H.C. McNeile respectively. Both characters served in the war and shared some their creators&#x27; history. The Bulldog Drummond books were popular among veterans after the war. Writers like Paul Fussell and Janet S.K. Watson have questioned &#x27;[w]hat role [...] memory play[s] in historical reconstruction’ - arguing that retrospective accounts are often disillusioned.

French writer and former infantryman on the Western Front Gabriel Chevallier wrote a novel &quot;Fear&quot; in 1930, based on his own experiences in the Great War. The novel was not published in English until 2011.

Although most famous for his popular &quot;Hornblower&quot; series of Napoleonic War adventure novels, C.S. Forester also wrote three novels set in the First World War. Of the three, only one- &quot;The General&quot; (1936) was set on the Western Front, the others &quot;The African Queen&quot; (1935), which was famously filmed in 1951, was set in German East Africa and &quot;Brown on Resolution&quot; (1929), was a naval adventure set in the Central Pacific. According to one source, Adolf Hitler admired the novel &quot;The General&quot; in the late 1930s and recommended it to his generals due to its depiction of the British military mindset.

Writer William March, who fought with the U.S. Marines in France during World War I, wrote a novel &quot;Company K&quot; in 1933, loosely based on his own experiences. Another American writer Dalton Trumbo wrote a bitterly anti-war novel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; in 1938 which won a National Book Award the following year and was made into a film in 1971. New Zealander John A Lee, who fought as an infantryman in World War I and who lost an arm, produced a novel &quot;Citizen into Soldier&quot; (1937) inspired by his own experiences.

=== Late 20th-century and beyond ===
Novels concerning World War I continued to appear in the latter half of the 20th century, albeit less frequently.

The novel &quot;Return to the Wood&quot; (1955) by James Lansdale Hodson depicted the court-martial of a British soldier accused of desertion, and the book was adapted as the play &quot;Hamp&quot; in 1964 by John Wilson and filmed as &quot;King and Country&quot; by Joseph Losey in the same year.

The novel &quot;Covenant with Death&quot; (1961) by John Harris portrays a Sheffield Pals Battalion on the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and Christopher Hitchens later referred to it as a &#x27;neglected masterpiece&#x27;. In the mid-1960s, there was a resurgence of fiction depicting the aerial campaigns of World War I, including &quot;The Blue Max&quot; (1964) by Jack D. Hunter, which became a major film in 1966 along with &quot;A Killing for the Hawks&quot; (1966) by Frederick E. Smith and &quot;In the Company of Eagles&quot; (1966) by Ernest K. Gann.

&quot;How Young They Died&quot; (1968) by Stuart Cloete was possibly the last novel written by an actual veteran. Elleston Trevor had made his name in the 1950s through episonage and WW2-themed novels but he turned to World War I with his novel &quot;Bury Him Among Kings&quot; (1970).

The novel &quot;Goshawk Squadron&quot; (1971) by Derek Robinson depicts a British air-force unit in the closing months of World War I, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and was later followed by two &#x27;prequels&#x27; set earlier in the conflict, &quot;War Story&quot; (1987) and &quot;Hornet&#x27;s Sting&quot; (1999). &quot;Three Cheers for Me&quot; (1962) and its sequel &quot;That&#x27;s Me in the Middle&quot; (1973) by Donald Jack, are narrated by fictional Canadian air ace Bart Bandy; both won the Leacock Medal. Canadian novelist Timothy Findley&#x27;s novel of the conflict &quot;The Wars&quot; was published in 1977 and it received his country&#x27;s top award for literature.

&quot;War Horse&quot; (1982) by Michael Morpurgo is set in World War I and won the Whitbread Book Award for 1982. It has been adapted into a play and film. U.S. writer Mark Helprin&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot; and French novelist Sebastien Japrisot&#x27;s &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; both appeared in 1991. The novel &quot;Birdsong&quot; (1993) by Sebastian Faulks received much praise.

Of similar acclaim is Pat Barker&#x27;s Regeneration Trilogy; the third novel from the series &quot;The Ghost Road,&quot; received the most prestigious award in British fiction: The Booker Prize in 1995 (though the nomination implied the award was for the whole series). In 2014, during the centenary of the World War I, the Indian author Akhil Katyal published the poem &#x27;Some letters of Indian soldiers at World War One&#x27; marking the contribution of more than a million Indian soldiers to the war.

To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War (2004) is a novel written by Jeff Shaara that uses perspectives from the generals and the doughboys and from the Allies and the Germans.

The 2011 novel &quot;The Absolutist&quot; was written by John Boyne, the story featuring two teenage friends who enlist in the British army together and experience the war on the Western Front. The 2016 novel &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; by Simon Tolkien (grandson of J. R. R. Tolkien) portrays a working-class boy who has been adopted by a wealthy family and who interrupts his Oxford studies to serve in the trenches.

The 2017 novel &quot;Kings of Broken Things&quot; by Theodore Wheeler follows the Miihlstein family as they are displaced by fighting in Galicia during World War I and relocate to Omaha, Nebraska. The novel depicts the struggles of displaced people to build a new life during the war and dramatizes the lynching of Will Brown in Omaha during the Red Summer that followed the war.

==Memoirs==
Captain John Hay Beith&#x27;s &quot;The First Hundred Thousand&quot;, a best-selling account of life in the army, was published in 1915 and became one of the more popular books of the period. It was translated into French as &quot;Les Premiers Cent Mille&quot;. Due to its popularity in the United States, which was neutral at the time, Beith was transferred to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C.

The memoirs of several famous aerial &#x27;aces&#x27; were published during the war, including &quot;Winged Warfare&quot; (1918) by Canadian William Bishop, &quot;Flying Fury&quot; (1918) by English ace James McCudden and &quot;The Red Fighter Pilot&quot; (1917) by Manfred von Richthofen (the latter two men were killed in action after their books were written).

After the war many participants published their memoirs and diaries. One of the first was &quot;Storm of Steel&quot; (1920) by German writer Ernst Jünger, an account of his experiences as an officer on the Western Front (it was first published in English in 1930). The first memoirs of Allied combatants were published in 1922, not long after the armistice: &quot;A Tank Driver&#x27;s Experiences&quot; by Arthur Jenkins and &quot;Disenchantment&quot; by Charles Edward Montague. These were shortly joined with &quot;Undertones of War&quot; (1928) by Edmund Blunden, &quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; (1929) by Robert Graves, &quot;A Subaltern&#x27;s War&quot; (1929) by Charles Edmund Carrington, &quot;A Passionate Prodigality&quot; (1933) by Guy Chapman and &quot;Blasting and Bombardiering&quot; (1937) by Percy Wyndham Lewis. Memoirs of airmen included &quot;Wind in the Wires&quot; (1933) by Duncan Grinnell-Milne, &quot;Wings of War&quot; (1933) by Rudolf Stark and &quot;Sagittarius Rising&quot; (1936) by Cecil Arthur Lewis. Nurses also published memoirs of their wartime experiences, such as &quot;A Diary without Dates&quot; (1918) by Enid Bagnold, &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; (1929) by Mary Borden, &quot;Testament of Youth&quot; (1933) by Vera Brittain and &quot;We That Were Young&quot; (1932) by Irene Rathbone.

Some Great War memoirs were not published until late in the 20th century or beyond, sometimes because the author did not write them until later in life or because they had been unable to, or had chosen not to, have them published at the time of writing (as a result, some manuscripts were published posthumously). One example was &quot;Poilu&quot; by French writer, barrel-maker and political activist Louis Barthas, a memoir written shortly after the war but not published until 1978 (the author died in 1952).The book described the author&#x27;s experiences as a corporal in the French army on the Western Front.

British WW1 veteran George Coppard published his memoir &quot;With a Machine-Gun to Cambrai&quot; in 1968 while former airman Arthur Gould Lee produced his own memoir &quot;No Parachute&quot; the same year.

The memoir &quot;Somme Mud&quot; was written in the 1920s but not published until 2006, over two decades after the author&#x27;s death. The author, Australian Edward Francis Lynch, fought with the AIF in France in 1916–1918.

&quot;The Burning of the World&quot;, first published in 2014, was a memoir of the Great War on the Eastern Front by Hungarian writer &amp; painter Bela Zombory-Moldovan who enlisted in the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1914 at age 29.

<doc id="246375" wikidata="Q2738838" url="?curid=246375" title="Music of Nigeria">
<text>The music of Nigeria includes many kinds of folk and popular music. Little of the country&#x27;s music history prior to European contact has been preserved, although bronze carvings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries have been found depicting musicians and their instruments. The country&#x27;s most internationally renowned genres are Indigenous, Apala, Aurrebbe music, Rara music, Were music, Ogene, Fuji, Jùjú, Afrobeat, Afrobeats, Igbo highlife, Afro-juju, Waka, Igbo rap, Gospel, Nigerian pop and Yo-pop. Styles of folk music are related to the over 250 ethnic groups in the country, each with their own techniques, instruments, and songs. 

The largest ethnic groups are the Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba. Traditional music from Nigeria and throughout Africa is often functional; in other words, it is performed to mark a ritual such as the wedding or funeral and not to achieve artistic goals. Although some Nigerians, especially children and the elderly, play instruments for their own amusement, solo performance is otherwise rare. Music is closely linked to agriculture, and there are restrictions on, for example, which instruments can be played during different parts of the planting season.

Work songs are a common type of traditional Nigerian music. They help to keep the rhythm of workers in fields, river canoes and other fields. Women use complex rhythms in housekeeping tasks, such as pounding yams to highly ornamented music. In the northern regions, farmers work together on each other&#x27;s farms and the host is expected to supply musicians for his neighbours.

The issue of musical composition is also highly variable. The Hwana, for example, believe that all songs are taught by the peoples&#x27; ancestors, while the Tiv give credit to named composers for almost all songs, and the Efik name individual composers only for secular songs. In many parts of Nigeria, musicians are allowed to say things in their lyrics that would otherwise be perceived as offensive. 

The most common format for music in Nigeria is the call-and-response choir, in which a lead singer and a chorus interchange verses, sometimes accompanied by instruments that either shadow the lead text or repeat and ostinato vocal phrase. The southern area features complex rhythms and solo players using melody instruments, while the north more typically features polyphonic wind ensembles. The extreme north region is associated with monodic (i.e., single-line) music with an emphasis on drums, and tends to be more influenced by Islamic music.

==Traditional music==
=== Hausa ===

The people of the North are known for complex percussion instrument music, the one-stringed goje, and a strong praise song vocal tradition. Under Muslim influence since the 14th century, Hausa music uses free-rhythmic improvisation and the Pentatonic scale, similar to other Muslim Sahelian tribes throughout West Africa, such as the Bambara, Kanuri, Fulani and Songhai. Traditional Hausa music is used to celebrate births, marriages, circumcisions, and other important life events. Hausa ceremonial music is well known in the area and is dominated by families of praise singers. The Hausa play percussion instruments such as the tambora drum and the talking drum. The most impressive of the Hausa state instruments, however, is the elongated state trumpet called Kakaki, which was originally used by the Songhai cavalry and was taken by the rising Hausa states as a symbol of military power. Kakaki trumpets can be more than two metres long, and can be easily broken down into three portable parts for easy transportation.

=== Igbo ===

The Igbo people live in the south-east of Nigeria, and play a wide variety of folk instruments. They are known for their ready adoption of foreign styles, and were an important part of Nigerian highlife. The most widespread instrument is the 13-stringed zither, called an &quot;obo&quot;. The Igbo also play slit drums, xylophones, flutes, lyres, udus and lutes, and more recently, imported European brass instruments.

Courtly music is played among the more traditional Igbo, maintaining their royal traditions. The &quot;ufie&quot; (slit drum) is used to wake the chief and communicate meal times and other important information to him. Bell and drum ensembles are used to announce when the chief departs and returns to his village. Meal times may include pie, and other dessert foods for the holidays.

=== Yoruba ===

The Yoruba have a drumming tradition, with a characteristic use of the dundun hourglass tension drums. Ensembles using the dundun play a type of music that is also called &quot;dundun&quot;. These ensembles consist of various sizes of tension drums, along with kettledrums (&quot;gudugudu&quot;). The leader of a dundun ensemble is the &quot;iyalu&quot;, who uses the drum to &quot;talk&quot; by imitating the tonality of Yoruba Much of Yoruba music is spiritual in nature, and is devoted to their God.

Yoruba music is one of the most important components of modern Nigerian popular music, as a result of its early influence from European, Islamic and Brazilian forms. These influences stemmed from the importation of brass instruments, sheet music, Islamic percussion and styles brought by Brazilian merchants. In both Nigeria&#x27;s most populous city, Lagos, and the largest city of Ibadan, these multicultural traditions combined add to the multicultural musical tapestry of Nigerian popular music. Modern styles such as Ayinde Barrister&#x27;s fuji, Salawa Abeni&#x27;s waka, and Yusuf Olatunji&#x27;s sakara are derived primarily from Yoruba traditional music. Many contemporary Yoruban musicians sing in their native language. 9ice is one of many that broke into the industry with Gongo Aso. UK-based saxophonist Tunday Akintan created yorubeat based on Yorùbá rhythms. Timi Korus, Babe mi Jowo, and Flosha rap and sing in Yoruba.

== Theatrical music ==

Nigerian theatre makes extensive use of music. Often, this is simply traditional music used in a theatrical production without adaptation. However, there are also distinct styles of music used in Nigerian opera. Here, music is used to convey an impression of the dramatic action to the audience. Music is also used in literary drama, although its musical accompaniment is more sparingly used than in opera; again, music communicates the mood or tone of events to the audience. An example is John Pepper Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Ozidi Saga&quot;, a play about murder and revenge, featuring both human and non-human actors. Each character in the play is associated with a personal theme song, which accompanies battles in which the character is involved.

Traditional Nigerian theatre includes puppet shows in Borno State and among the Ogoni and Tiv, and the ancient Yoruba Aláàrìnjó tradition, which may be descended from the Egúngún masquerade. With the influx of road-building colonial powers, these theatre groups spread across the country and their productions grew ever more elaborate. They now typically use European instruments, film extracts and recorded music.

In the past, both Hubert Ogunde and Ade Love produced soundtracks for their movies using very rich Yoruba language. Modern-day Yoruba film and theater music composers among whom Tope Alabi is the flagbearer have variously accompanied dramatic actions with original music.

===Television and film scoring===
Since the introduction of television in 1959, the growing television and film industries have sourced a large amount of their artists and musical structure from Nigeria&#x27;s extensive indigenous theater, which, in turn, evolved from festivals and religious ceremonies. Early television dramas in this era utilized folklore and songs from popular indigenous genres such as Nigerian highlife, as well as indigenous languages including Igbo, Yoruba, and so on. With the advent of Nigeria&#x27;s film industry, controversially referred to as Nollywood, in the early 1990s, many of these TV producers simultaneously worked in film production, spreading this technique of indigenous sourcing to film scoring. Following an era defined by influences from European and North American art, the Nigerian film industry evolved a unique method of film scoring called &quot;prefiguring&quot;.

Prefiguring, popularized by the famous Nigerian soundtrack producer Stanley Okorie, utilizes motifs and repetitive tunes to foreshadow dialogue and major plot events before they happen on screen. This novel film scoring technique unique to the Nigerian film industry draws upon the art of storytelling in indigenous communities of Nigeria, displaying qualities of the communities’ languages, songs, dances, and dramas.

== Children&#x27;s music ==

Children in Nigeria have many of their own traditions, usually singing games. These are most often call-and-response type songs, using archaic language. There are other songs, such as among the Tarok people that are sexually explicit and obscene, and are only performed far away from the home. Children also use instruments such as un-pitched raft zithers (made from cornstalks) and drums made from tin cans, a pipe made from a pawpaw stem and a jaw harp made from a sorghum stalk. Among the Hausa, children play a unique instrument in which they beat rhythms on the inflated stomach of a live, irritated pufferfish.

== Traditional instruments ==

Although percussion instruments are omnipresent, Nigeria&#x27;s traditional music uses a number of diverse instruments. Many, such as the xylophone, are an integral part of music across West Africa, while others are imports from the Muslims of the Maghreb, or from Southern or East Africa; other instruments have arrived from Europe or the Americas. Brass instruments and woodwinds were early imports that played a vital role in the development of Nigerian music, while the later importation of electric guitars spurred the popularisation of jùjú music.

=== Percussion ===
The xylophone is a tuned idiophone, common throughout west and central Africa. In Nigeria, they are most common in the southern part of the country, and are of the central African model. Several people sometimes simultaneously play a single xylophone. The instruments are usually made of loose wood placed across banana logs. Pit- and box-resonated xylophones are also found. Ensembles of clay pots beaten with a soft pad are common; they are sometimes filled with water. Although normally tuned, untuned examples are sometimes used to produce a bass rhythm. Hollow logs are also used, split lengthways, with resonator holes at the end of the slit. They were traditionally used to communicate over great distances.

Various bells are a common part of royal regalia, and were used in secret societies. They are usually made of iron, or in Islamic orchestras of the north, of bronze. Struck gourds, placed on a cloth and struck with sticks, are a part of women&#x27;s music, as well as the bòòríí cult dances. Sometimes, especially in the north, gourds are placed upside-down in water, with the pitch adjusted by the amount of air underneath it. In the south-west, a number of tuned gourds are played while floating in a trough.

Scrapers are common throughout the south. One of the most common types is a notched stick, played by dragging a shell across the stick at various speeds. It is used both as a women&#x27;s court instrument and by children in teasing games. Among the Yoruba, an iron rod may be used as a replacement for a stick. Rattles are common, made of gourds containing seeds or stones are common, as are net-rattles, in which a string network of beads or shells encloses a gourd. Rattles are typically played in ritual or religious context, predominantly by women.

Drums of many kinds are the most common type of percussion instrument in Nigeria. They are traditionally made from a single piece of wood or spherical calabashes, but have more recently been made from oil drums. The hourglass drum is the most common shape, although there are also double-headed barrel drums, single-headed drums and conical drums. Frame drums are also found in Nigeria, but may be an importation from Brazil. An unusual percussion instrument is the udu, a kind of vessel drum.
This instrument is very essential in most African countries.

=== String instruments ===

The musical bow is found in Nigeria as a mouth-resonated cord, either plucked or struck. It is most common in the central part of the country, and is associated with agricultural songs and those expressing social concerns. Cereal stalks bound together and strings supported by two bridges are used to make a kind of raft zither, played with the thumbs, typically for solo entertainment. The arched harp is found in the eastern part of the country, especially among the Tarok. It usually has five or six strings and pentatonic tuning. A bowl-resonated spike-fiddle with a lizard skin table is used in the northern region, and is similar to central Asian and Ethiopian forms. The Hausa and Kanuri peoples play a variety of spike-lutes.

=== Other instruments ===

A variety of brass and woodwind instruments are also found in Nigeria. These include long trumpets, frequently made of aluminium and played in pairs or ensembles of up to six, often accompanied by a shawm. Wooden trumpets, gourd trumpets, end-blown flutes, cruciform whistles, transverse clarinets and various kinds of horns are also found.

== Popular music ==
Many African countries have seen turbulence and violence during their forced transition from a diverse region of folk cultures to a group of modern nation states. Nigeria has experienced more difficulty than most African countries in forging a popular cultural identity from the diverse peoples of the countryside. From its beginnings in the streets of Lagos, popular music in Nigeria has long been an integral part of the field of African pop, bringing in influences and instruments from many ethnic groups to form Nigerian popular music.

The earliest styles of Nigerian popular music often referred to as Naija Music were palm-wine music and highlife, which spread in the 1920s among Nigeria and nearby countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana. In Nigeria, juju music was created. During this time, a few other styles such as apala, derived from traditional Yoruba music, also found a more limited audience. By the 1960s, Cuban, American and other styles of imported music were enjoying a large following, and musicians started to incorporate these influences into jùjú; intermingling of Hausa populations with Middle Eastern communities in cities south of the country notably introduced them to Bollywood and its music. The result was a profusion of new styles in the last few decades of the 20th century, including waka music, Yo-pop and Afrobeat.

=== Palm-wine and the invention of jùjú ===
By the start of the 20th century, Yoruba music had incorporated brass instruments, written notation, Islamic percussion and new Brazilian techniques, resulting in the Lagos-born palm-wine style. The term &quot;palm-wine&quot; is also used to describe related genres in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana. These varieties are better known than Nigerian palm-wine. However, &quot;palm-wine&quot; originally referred to a diverse set of styles played with string instruments, characteristically, guitars or banjos) with shakers and hand drums accompanying This urban style was frequently played in bars to accompany drinking (hence the name, which is derived from the alcoholic palm wine beverage).

The first stars of palm-wine had emerged by the 1920s, the most famous of whom was Baba Tunde King. King probably coined the word &quot;jùjú&quot; — a style of music he helped to create — in reference to the sound of a Brazilian tambourine; alternatively, the term may have developed as an expression of disdain by the colonial leaders (any native tradition was apt to be dismissed as &#x27;mere &quot;joujou&quot;, French for &quot;nonsense&quot;). By the early 1930s, British record labels such as His Master&#x27;s Voice had started to record palm-wine, and more celebrities emerged, including Ojoge Daniel, Tunde Nightingale and Speedy Araba. These artists, along with Tunde King, established the core of the style which was called jùjú, and remained one of the most popular genres in Nigeria throughout the 20th century. Some Jùjú musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the &quot;blind minstrel&quot; Kokoro.

=== Apala ===
Apala is a style of vocal and percussive Muslim Yoruba music. It emerged in the late 1930s as a means of rousing worshippers after the fasting of Ramadan. Under the influence of popular Afro-Cuban percussion, apala developed into a more polished style and attracted a large audience. The music required two or three talking drums (&quot;omele&quot;), a rattle (&quot;sekere&quot;), thumb piano (&quot;agidigbo&quot;) and a bell (&quot;agogo&quot;). Haruna Ishola was the most famous apala performer, and he later played an integral role in bringing apala to larger audiences as a part of fuji music.

=== The 1950s, &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s ===
Following World War II, Nigerian music started to take on new instruments and techniques, including electric instruments imported from the United States and Europe. Rock N&#x27; roll, soul, and later funk, became very popular in Nigeria, and elements of these genres were added to jùjú by artists such as I. K. Dairo. Meanwhile, highlife had been slowly gaining in popularity among the Igbo people, and their unique style soon found a national audience. At the same time, apala&#x27;s Haruna Ishola was becoming one of the country&#x27;s biggest stars. In the early to mid-1970s, three of the biggest names in Nigerian music history were at their peak: Fela Kuti, Ebenezer Obey and King Sunny Adé, while the end of that decade saw the start of Yo-pop and Nigerian reggae.

Although popular styles such as highlife and jùjú were at the top of the Nigerian charts in the &#x27;60s, traditional music remained widespread. Traditional stars included the Hausa Dan Maraya, who was so well known that he was brought to the battlefield during the 1967 Nigerian Civil War to lift the morale of the federal troops.

==== Modernisation of Jùjú ====

Following World War II, Tunde Nightingale&#x27;s s&#x27;o wa mbe style made him one of the first jùjú stars, and he introduced more Westernised pop influences to the genre. During the 1950s, recording technology grew more advanced, and the gangan talking drum, electric guitar and accordion were incorporated into jùjú. Much of this innovation was the work of IK Dairo &amp; the Morning Star Orchestra (later &quot;IK Dairo &amp; the Blue Spots&quot;), which formed in 1957. These performers brought jùjú from the rural poor to the urban cities of Nigeria and beyond. Dairo became perhaps the biggest star of African music by the &#x27;60s, recording numerous hit songs that spread his fame to as far away as Japan. In 1963, he became the only African musician ever honoured by receiving membership in the Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry in the United Kingdom.

==== Dispersion of highlife ====
Among the Igbo people, Ghanaian highlife became popular in the early 1950s, and other guitar-band styles from Cameroon and Zaire soon followed. The Ghanaian E. T. Mensah, easily the most popular highlife performer of the 1950s, toured Igbo-land frequently, drawing huge crowds of devoted fans. Bobby Benson &amp; His Combo was the first Nigerian highlife band to find audiences across the country. Benson was followed by Jim Lawson &amp; the Mayor&#x27;s Dance Band, who achieved national fame in the mid-&#x27;70s, ending with Lawson&#x27;s death in 1971. During the same period, other highlife performers were reaching their peak. These included Prince Nico Mbarga and his band Rocafil Jazz, whose &quot;Sweet Mother&quot; was a pan-African hit that sold more than 13 million copies, more than any other African single of any kind. Mbarga used English lyrics in a style that he dubbed panko, which incorporated &quot;sophisticated rumba guitar-phrasing into the highlife idiom&quot;.

After the civil war in the 1960s, Igbo musicians were forced out of Lagos and returned to their homeland. The result was that highlife ceased to be a major part of mainstream Nigerian music, and was thought of as being something purely associated with the Igbos of the east. Highlife&#x27;s popularity slowly dwindled among the Igbos, supplanted by jùjú and fuji. However, a few performers kept the style alive, such as Yoruba singer and trumpeter Victor Olaiya (the only Nigerian to ever earn a platinum record), Stephen Osita Osadebe, Oliver De Coque, Celestine Ukwu, Oriental Brothers, Sonny Okosun, Victor Uwaifo, and Orlando &quot;Dr. Ganja&quot; Owoh, whose distinctive toye style fused jùjú and highlife.

==== Birth of fuji ====
Apala, a traditional style from Ogun state, one of the Yoruba states in Nigeria, became very popular in the 1960s, led by performers including Haruna Ishola, Sefiu Ayan, Kasumu Adio, and Ayinla Omowura. Ishola, who was one of Nigeria&#x27;s most consistent hit makers between 1955 and his death in 1983, recorded apala songs, which alternated between slow and emotional, and swift and energetic. His lyrics were a mixture of improvised praise and passages from the Quran, as well as traditional proverbs. His work became a formative influence on the developing fuji style.

The late 1960s saw the appearance of the first fuji bands. Fuji was named after Mount Fuji in Japan, purely for the sound of the word, according to Ayinde Barrister. Fuji was a synthesis of apala with the &quot;ornamented, free-rhythmic&quot; vocals of &quot;ajisari&quot; devotional musicians and was accompanied by the sakara, a tambourine-drum, and Hawaiian guitar. Among the genre&#x27;s earliest stars were Haruna Ishola and Ayinla Omowura; Ishola released numerous hits from the late &#x27;50s to the early &#x27;80s, becoming one of the country&#x27;s most famous performers. Fuji grew steadily more popular between the 1960s and &#x27;70s, becoming closely associated with Islam in the process.

Fuji has been described as jùjú without guitars; ironically, Ebenezer Obey once described jùjú as mambo with guitars. However, at its roots, fuji is a mixture of Muslim traditional were music&#x27; ajisari songs with &quot;aspects of apala percussion and vocal songs and brooding, philosophical sakara music&quot;; Of these elements, &quot;apala&quot; is the fundamental basis of fuji The first stars of fuji were the rival bandleaders Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister and Ayinla Kollington Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister started his fuji career in the early 1970s with the Golden Fuji Group, although he had sung Muslim songs since he was 10 years old. He first changed his group&#x27;s name to &quot;Fuji Londoners&quot; when he came back from a trip to London, England. After a very long time — with hits such as &quot;Orilonise&quot;, &quot;Fuji Disco/Iku Baba Obey&quot;, &quot;Oke Agba&quot;, &quot;Aye&quot;, and &quot;Suuru&quot; — he changed the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Supreme Fuji Commanders&quot;. Ayinde&#x27;s rival was Ayinla Kollington or &quot;Baba Alatika&quot;, known for fast tempo and dance-able brand of fuji, who also recorded hit albums like &quot;ko bo simi lo&#x27;run mo e, in the &#x27;80s he released &quot;ijo yoyo, Lakukulala and American megastar&quot; to mention few of his successful albums. With all due respect Ayinla Kollington is a coherent social commentator. He was followed in the 1980s by burgeoning stars such as Wasiu Ayinde Marshall.

==== Sunny Ade and Obey ====
Ebenezer Obey formed the &quot;International Brothers&quot; in 1964, and his band soon rivalled that of IK Dairo as the biggest Nigerian group. They played a form of bluesy, guitar-based and highlife-influenced jùjú that included complex talking drum-dominated percussion elements. Obey&#x27;s lyrics addressed issues that appealed to urban listeners, and incorporated Yoruba traditions and his conservative Christian faith. His rival was King Sunny Adé, who emerged in the same period, forming the &quot;Green Spots&quot; in 1966 and then achieving some major hits with the &quot;African Beats&quot; after 1974&#x27;s &quot;Esu Biri Ebo Mi&quot;. Ade and Obey raced to incorporate new influences into jùjú music and to gather new fans; Hawaiian slack-key, keyboards and background vocals were among the innovations added during this rapidly changing period. Ade added strong elements of Jamaican dub music, and introduced the practice of having the guitar play the rhythm and the drums play the melody. During this period, jùjú songs changed from short pop songs to long tracks, often over 20 minutes in length. Bands increased from four performers in the original ensembles, to 10 with IK Dairo and more than 30 with Obey and Ade.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
In the early 1980s, both Obey and Ade found larger audiences outside of Nigeria. In 1982, Ade was signed to Island Records, who hoped to replicate Bob Marley&#x27;s success, and released &quot;Juju Music&quot;, which sold far beyond expectations in Europe and the United States. Obey released &quot;Current Affairs&quot; in 1980 on Virgin Records and became a brief star in the UK, but was not able to sustain his international career as long as Ade. Ade led a brief period of international fame for jùjú, which ended in 1985 when he lost his record contract after the commercial failure of &quot;Aura&quot; (recorded with Stevie Wonder) and his band walked out in the middle of a huge Japanese tour. Ade&#x27;s brush with international renown brought a lot of attention from mainstream record companies, and helped to inspire the burgeoning world music industry. By the end of the 1980s, jùjú had lost out to other styles, like Yo-pop, gospel and reggae. In the 1990s, however, fuji and jùjú remained popular, as did waka music and Nigerian reggae. At the very end of the decade, hip hop music spread to the country after being a major part of music in neighboring regions like Senegal.

==== Yo-pop and Afro-jùjú (1980s) ====
Two of the biggest stars of the &#x27;80s were Segun Adewale and Shina Peters, who started their careers performing in the mid-&#x27;70s with Prince Adekunle. They eventually left Adekunle and formed a brief partnership as &quot;Shina Adewale &amp; the International Superstars&quot; before beginning solo careers. Adewale was the first of the two to gain success, when he became the most famous performer of Yo-pop.

The Yo-pop craze did not last for long, replaced by Shina Peters&#x27; Afro-juju style, which broke into the mainstream after the release of &quot;Afro-Juju Series 1&quot; (1989). Afro-juju was a combination of Afrobeat and fuji, and it ignited such fervor among Shina&#x27;s fans that the phenomenon was dubbed &quot;Shinamania&quot;. Though he was awarded Juju Musician of the Year in 1990, Shina&#x27;s follow-up, &quot;Shinamania&quot; sold respectively but was panned by critics. His success opened up the field to newcomers, however, leading to the success of Fabulous Olu Fajemirokun and Adewale Ayuba. The same period saw the rise of new styles like the &quot;funky juju&quot; pioneered by Dele Taiwo.

==== Afrobeat ====
Afrobeat is a style most closely associated with Nigeria, and Afrobeat recordings are a prominent part of the world music category found throughout the developed world. It is music with elements of Fuji, juju, jazz and other music genres. The most popular and well-known performer, indeed the most famous Nigerian musician in history, is undoubtedly Fela Kuti. Although Kuti is often credited as the only pioneer of Afrobeat, other musicians such as Orlando Julius Ekemode were also prominent in the early Afrobeat scene, where they combined highlife, jazz and funk. A brief period in the United States saw him exposed to the Black Power movement and the Black Panthers, an influence that he would come to express in his lyrics. After living in London briefly, he moved back to Lagos and opened a club, The Shrine, which was one of the most popular music spots in the city. He started recording with Africa &#x27;70, a huge band featuring drummer Tony Allen, who has since gone on to become a well-known musician in his own right. With Africa 70, Kuti recorded a series of hits, earning the ire of the government as he tackled such diverse issues as poverty, traffic and skin-bleaching. In 1985, Kuti was jailed for five years, but was released after only two years after international outcry and massive domestic protests. Upon release, Kuti continued to criticise the government in his songs, and became known for eccentric behaviour, such as suddenly divorcing all twenty-eight wives because &quot;no man has the right to own a woman&#x27;s vagina&quot;. His death from AIDS in 1997 sparked a period of national mourning that was unprecedented in documented Nigerian history.

In the 1980s, Afrobeat became affiliated with the burgeoning genre of world music. In Europe and North America, so-called &quot;world music&quot; acts came from all over the world and played in a multitude of styles. Fela Kuti and his Afrobeat followers were among the most famous musicians considered world music.

From the 1980s to&#x27; the 1990s, Afrobeat had diversified by taking in new influences from US funk and hip hop. The ever-masked and enigmatic Lágbájá became one of the standard-bearers of the new wave of Afrobeat, especially after his 1996 LP &quot;C&#x27;est Une African Thing&quot;. Following a surprise appearance in place of his father, Fela, Femi Kuti garnered a large fan base that enabled him to tour across Europe. Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti followed their father Fela Kuti.

==== Waka ====
The popular singer Salawa Abeni had become nationally renowned after the release of &quot;Late General Murtala Ramat Mohammed&quot; in 1976, which was the first Nigerian recording by a woman to sell more than a million copies. In the 1980s, she remained one of the nation&#x27;s best-selling artists, creating her own unique variety of music called waka; she was so closely associated with the genre that a royal figure, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, crowned her the &quot;Queen of Waka Music&quot; in 1992. Waka was a fusion of jùjú, fuji and traditional Yoruba music.

==== Reggae and hip hop ====

When talking about reggae music in Nigeria, this brand of music was started by a musician simply called &quot;Terakota&quot;. By the 80s, Nigerian reggae stars included Daniel Wilson, The Mandators, Ras Kimono, Majek Fashek, whose 1988 cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Redemption Song&quot;, became an unprecedented success for reggae in Nigeria. Like many later Nigerian reggae stars, Fashek was a part of the long-running band The Mandators, who toured and recorded incessantly during the mid to late 1980s and early &#x27;90s. Later prominent reggae musicians included Jerri Jheto and Daddy Showkey.

African Caribbean fusion is a genre that has been popular and growing over the years, especially in the 21st century. In this genre of music African musicians incorporate Jamaican patois into their lyrics and beats. Although, very popular in Jamaica, this genre well blended genre became well known in the African region around the 19th century because of the Nigerian Reggae musician Majek Fashek who attracted international attention to this fusion. This genre of music is gaining far more presence in Nigeria with recent 21st-century artists such as Duncan Mighty, Timaya, Slim Burna, Orezi, Burna Boy and Patoranking, who are attracting a younger audience.

Hip hop music was brought to Nigeria in the late 1980s, and grew steadily popular throughout the first part of the 1990s. The first acts included Sound on Sound, Emphasis, Ruff Rugged &amp; Raw, SWAT ROOT, De Weez and Black Masquradaz. Moreover, mainstream success grew later in the decade, with attention brought by early hits like The Trybesmen&#x27;s &quot;Trybal Marks&quot; (1999) and the trio The Remedies&#x27; &quot;Judile&quot; and &quot;Sakoma&quot;. One of The Remedies, Tony Tetuila, went on to work with the Plantashun Boiz to great commercial acclaim. The 1999 founding of Paybacktyme Records by Solomon Dare, popularly known as Solodee, Kennis Music by Kenny Ogungbe, Dove Records by Nelson Brown, and Trybe Records by eLDee helped redefined and establish a Nigerian hip-hop scene. Also, the general rapid growth of the entertainment scene with support from the media helped popularise hip hop music in Nigeria. Television Programmes like Videowheels, HipTV, Music Africa, the MTN Y&#x27;ello show, Music Africa, Nigezie, and Soundcity played a major role. Other prominent Nigerian hip-hop musicians include Tuface idibia, Vector, Reminisce, Ice Prince, M.I Abaga, Ruggedman, Eedris Abdulkareem, Erigga, Weird MC, Naeto C, Twin-X, and P-Square

Around the close of 2012 hip-hop movement began to lose its popularity in Nigeria. Afrobeats artists began to rule the game notable acts such as

Wizkid, Davido, Olamide, Burna Boy, CKay, Fireboy DML, Kiss Daniel, Tekno, Mc Galaxy, Adekunle Gold, Dammy Krane Lil Kesh have over the years gotten great attention for their songs.

As of 2023, a new chain of hip hop artists once again have proven to keep the genre alive in Nigeria. Although not as popular as afrobeats, artists like PsychoYP have proven to be oriented in drill music, Blue Ivan most times categorized as a modern pop artist has also proven to represent the genre with an endless catalog of trap and psychedelic pop music.

== Afrobeats: international breakthrough ==
Unlike Afrobeat, Afrobeats has seen global success since 2018. Nigerian artists are the main contributors to this.
According to Billboard Magazine, Nigeria&#x27;s Afrobeats is the fastest-growing genre in the United States and in the United Kingdom as of 2023. Afrobeats star CKay said, &quot;Afrobeats is the new pop.&quot;

=== Firm fixture at awards ceremonies ===
Nigerian musicians are increasingly receiving international recognition.

Artists such as King Sunny Ade, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti have received Grammy nominations in the past.

Burna Boy&#x27;s &quot;African Giant&quot; received a Grammy Awards nomination in 2020 for Best World Music Album. His &quot;Twice as Tall&quot; received a Grammy for Best Global Music Album the following year. Wizkid&#x27;s &quot;Made in Lagos&quot; was nominated in the same category in 2021. Wizkids &quot;Essence&quot; featuring Tems was also nominated in the Best Global Music Performance category.

The collaboration of Afrobeats artists with the world&#x27;s biggest music stars has led to further global exposure. In 2019, US star Beyoncé enlisted the services of numerous Nigerian stars, including Wizkid and Burna Boy. Her &quot;Brown Skin Girl&quot; won Best Music Video at the 2021 Grammys. Angélique Kidjo&#x27;s album &quot;Mother Nature&quot; (2021), featuring many Nigerian stars, was nominated for the Best Global Music Album award.

The success of Nigerian Afrobeats led to the introduction of the &quot;Best African Act&quot; category at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2005, followed by the BET Awards in 2011, which have since awarded prizes in the &quot;Best International Act: Africa&quot; category.

=== Chart positions ===
In 2012, D&#x27;banj&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and number 2 on the UK R&amp;B Chart. It was the first Nigerian Afrobeats song to achieve this.

In April 2012, P-Square remixed their 2009 hit single &#x27;E No Easy&#x27; with Matt Houston, and it became the first Nigerian afrobeats song to reach top 5 on SNEP - French Official chart and top 10 on Ultratop- Belgium official, spending 29 weeks and 16 weeks respectively. The song was the First Afrobeats Summer hit in France, which in turn boosted afrobeats visibility in the francophone countries in Europe.

Wizkid&#x27;s &quot;Essence&quot;, featuring Tems, entered the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 100 as a remix with Justin Bieber.

=== Sold-out arenas ===
Nigerian pop musicians such as Wizkid, Davido and Burna Boy have sold out the O2 Arena in London and the Accor Arena in Paris respectively.

== Women in music ==
In the Nigerian music industry female artists stand out and are widely recognized for their talents and achievements. Over the years, most Nigerian female artists stuck to contemporary African music, but in the 21st century, several female artists began to diversify into other genres including rap, hip-hop and Afrobeat. Notable female Nigerian rappers include Weird Mc, Sasha P, Mo&#x27;Cheddah and Eva Alordiah. While there are many female Afrobeats artists, only a few have been constant over the years like Aṣa Omawumi Megbele, Seyi Shay, Niniola, Tiwa Savage, Teni, Yemi Alade and Simi.
The 2020s saw a surge in the presence of women in Nigerian music with artistes like Tems and Ayra Starr gaining international accolades and recognition.

== Music at festivals and holidays ==

Durbar festivals are held in many parts of North-west Nigeria; durbar is meant to honour the Emir during the culmination of the Islamic festivals Eid ul-Fitr, Eid ul-Adha, and Sallah for the well-known Katsina durbar, and is sometimes also used to honour visiting dignitaries . Although the principal attraction of the durbar festivals is displays of traditional horsemanship, performances by drummers, trumpeters and praise-singers are an important part of the celebration  Other holidays in which music plays an important role include drumming and dances performed at Christmas, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.

== Classical music ==
In the 20th century, Nigeria produced a number of classical composers; these include Samuel Akpabot (1932-2000), Ayo Bankole (1935-1976), Lazarus Ekwueme, Akin Euba (1935-2020), Fela Sowande (1905-1987) and Joshua Uzoigwe (1946-2005). Sowande was one of the first and most famous African composers in the Western classical tradition, and founder of the Nigerian art music tradition. Sowande was also an organist and jazz musician, incorporating these and elements of Nigerian folk music into his work. Echezonachukwu Nduka, a Nigerian concert pianist and poet, specializes in the performance and recording of piano music by Nigerian composers and by extension, African composers working within the genre of African Pianism.
